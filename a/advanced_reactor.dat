25|$|The Clean And Environmentally Safe <b>Advanced</b> <b>Reactor</b> (CAESAR), {{a nuclear}} reactor concept that would use steam as a {{moderator}} to control delayed neutrons, will potentially be able to burn 238U as fuel once the reactor is started with LEU fuel.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, construction, or capital cost aside, {{measures}} to mitigate global warming {{such as a}} carbon tax or carbon emissions trading, increasingly favor the economics of nuclear power. Further efficiencies are hoped to be achieved through more <b>advanced</b> <b>reactor</b> designs, Generation III reactors promise {{to be at least}} 17% more fuel efficient, and have lower capital costs, while futuristic Generation IV reactors promise 10000-30000% greater fuel efficiency and the elimination of nuclear waste.|$|E
25|$|Currently most of {{the nuclear}} power {{stations}} must operate below the temperatures and pressures that coal-fired plants do, {{in order to provide}} more conservative safety margins within the systems that remove heat from the nuclear fuel rods. This, in turn, limits their thermodynamic efficiency to 30–32%. Some <b>advanced</b> <b>reactor</b> designs being studied, such as the very high temperature reactor, advanced gas-cooled reactor and supercritical water reactor, would operate at temperatures and pressures similar to current coal plants, producing comparable thermodynamic efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The United States generates about 18% of its {{electricity}} from nuclear power plants. Nuclear engineers {{in this field}} generally work, directly or indirectly, in the nuclear power industry or for national laboratories. Current research in the industry is directed at producing economical, proliferation-resistant reactor designs with passive safety features. Some government labs research the same areas as industry, they also study a myriad of other issues such as nuclear fuels and nuclear fuel cycles, <b>advanced</b> <b>reactor</b> designs, and nuclear weapon design and maintenance. A principal pipeline for trained personnel for US reactor facilities is the Navy Nuclear Power Program. The job outlook for nuclear engineering from the year 2012 to the year 2022 is predicted to grow 9% due to many elder nuclear engineers retiring, safety systems needing to be updated in power plants, and the advancements made in nuclear medicine.|$|E

An upper limit is set by the constraint that any solid oxides of Pb or Bi will not be formed in the liquid, which otherwise might contaminate the systems [1], or which otherwise might provide a source of oxygen that cannot be easily removed [3]...|$|R
