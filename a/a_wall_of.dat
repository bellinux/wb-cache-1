There is also a small bust of B-P outside <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> Brownsea Castle, flanked by two large information posters, and beside it is a copy of B-P's footprint.|$|E
5|$|In August 2016, new {{information}} about Wallenberg's death came to light when the diary of KGB head Ivan Serov surfaced after Serov's granddaughter found the diary hidden in <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> her house. “I have no doubts that Wallenberg was liquidated in 1947” Serov wrote.|$|E

There are clamp connections at the septa (the walls dividing individual hypha cells). The flesh in the cap is radial, and {{is made up}} of yellowish hyphae of between 2.4 and 20μm wide. The pileipellis, the outermost layer of hyphae, forms a cutis, and on older specimens (and on the small scales) forms a trichoderm.|$|E
5|$|As he withdrew, Frederick {{established}} a fighting line {{north of the}} village, and it eventually served as a rallying point for stragglers and survivors. By mid-morning, around 10:00, the Prussians retreated to the north-west. Any pursuing troops were met with <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> musket fire. Frederick and his surviving army were {{out of range of}} the Austrian army by the time they had reorganized. Hans Joachim von Zieten and Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, who also had remained alert all night, organized a rear guard action that prevented the Austrians from falling upon the retreating Prussians. This discouraged even the most determined Austrians; the Croats and irregulars contented themselves with pillaging the village and the Prussian bodies.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{was buried}} {{according}} to her wishes, but her tombstone was moved from the floor to <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> Ara Coeli during works on {{the interior of the}} church in 1590. The original epitaph was destroyed at that time, but the Roman calligrapher Giovanni Battista Palatino had recorded it in 1545 and published two years later. It was uniquely bilingual and digraphic, written both in Latin language and script and in Bosnian language and Cyrillic. Only the Latin epitaph was restored, and can be found on her tombstone today.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Boone {{was honored}} with a 6-cent stamp in the American Folklore Series on September 26, 1968, at Frankfort, Kentucky, {{where he was}} buried. He was a famous frontiersman in the {{development}} of Virginia, Kentucky and the trans-Appalachian west. <b>A</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> roughly-hewn boards displays the tools of Boone's trade—a Pennsylvania rifle, a powder horn, and a knife. The pipe tomahawk represents that the Shawnees had adopted Boone. His name and birth date were carved on the wall.|$|E
5|$|Depictions in {{classical}} art are rare for such striking birds. The only known Ancient Egyptian {{example is a}} relief, probably of a little green bee-eater, on <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> Queen Hatshepsut's mortuary temple, and an early Roman mural depicting blue-cheeked bee-eaters {{was found in the}} villa of Agrippina. Bee-eaters have been depicted on the postage stamps of at least 38 countries, the European and Carmine bee-eaters being the most common subjects, with 18 and 11 countries respectively.|$|E
5|$|Sometime later, {{the player}} wakes up to Chirithy at a {{simulation}} of Enchanted Dominion.

On {{the other side of the}} thorns, Maleficent (who is heavily implied to have found the Book of Prophecies) congratulates herself with what she has accomplished whilst wondering where Pete is.

5|$|Stanley Halls (in South Norwood) {{were opened}} on 2 February 1903 by Charles Ritchie, 1st Baron Ritchie of Dundee {{at a cost}} of £13,000 (as Stanley Public Hall) to provide the local {{community}} with a public space for plays, concerts and lectures. It was the first building in Croydon to have electricity. In 1904 a clock tower and a hall were added. In 1993, a blue plaque was installed on <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> Stanley Halls by English Heritage. The plaque reads W.F.R. STANLEY (1829–1909) Inventor, Manufacturer and Philanthropist, founded and designed these halls and technical school. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

Beyoncé enters the club {{with a different}} outfit and hairstyle and some friends. Male patrons seated at the tables look on. She and Usher notice each other. They meet {{on the dance floor}} and dance intimately. Beyoncé performs an elaborate dance scene with female backing dancers. She swirls around in a champagne glass filled with bubbles. In the final scene, Beyoncé sits atop a piano and after being lifted down by a gentleman, she dances and poses as confetti falls everywhere.|$|E
5|$|Two sculptures made by Dan Corson were {{installed}} at the station's underground level: Portals consists of <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> portals with images from the Hubble Space Telescope, microscopes, and the deep sea at the elevator lobby; Space Forms {{is a series of}} brightly-colored, translucent sculptures suspended above the platforms that resemble microscopic creatures floating under a microscope. An additional installation, Bill Bell's Light Sticks, is embedded in the walls of the Beacon Hill Tunnel. A series of LED displays, typically showing images of playing cards, flash for 1/30th of a second through the train windows. The art is considered by Sound Transit an extension of Bell's installation at the University Street station that similarly depends on persistence of vision to project subliminal images.|$|E

5|$|Unlike true fungi, {{the cell}} walls of oomycetes contain {{cellulose}} and lack chitin. Hyphochytrids have both chitin and cellulose. Slime molds lack a cell wall during the assimilative phase (except labyrinthulids, which have <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> scales), and ingest nutrients by ingestion (phagocytosis, except labyrinthulids) rather than absorption (osmotrophy, as fungi, labyrinthulids, oomycetes and hyphochytrids). Neither water molds nor slime molds {{are closely related}} to the true fungi, and, therefore, taxonomists no longer group them in the kingdom Fungi. Nonetheless, studies of the oomycetes and myxomycetes are still often included in mycology textbooks and primary research literature.|$|E
5|$|Allison made {{landfall}} with a {{storm surge}} {{of two to}} three feet. Combined with waves on top, areas of Galveston Island experienced <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> water 8feet (2.5m) in height, creating overwash along the coastline. The storm caused winds of up to 43mph (69km/h) at the Galveston Pier. While Allison was stalling over Texas, it dropped heavy rainfall across the state, including 9.77inches (248mm) in Galveston, 12.13inches (308mm) in Jamaica Beach, Texas, and other similar totals along the coast. Minimal beach erosion was reported, and impact was minimal near the coast. While moving northward through Texas as a minimal tropical depression, Allison produced minor wind gusts. Shortly after making landfall, the storm spawned a tornado in Manvel of Brazoria County, causing damage to one home. Within hours of making landfall, rainfall totals of 8 to 12inches (200 to 300mm) were common in Galveston and Harris County. Flash flooding continued for days, with rainfall amounts across the state peaking at just over 40inches (1,033mm) in northwestern Jefferson County. In the Port of Houston, a total of 36.99inches (940mm) was reported.|$|E
5|$|Although no Chinese sources {{detail the}} event, Portuguese sources tell {{of how the}} Portuguese were summoned on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month to ceremoniously {{prostrate}} themselves before <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the Forbidden City to seek another audience with the emperor. From Beijing, the Portuguese embassy heard reports that the emperor reached Tongzhou in January 1521 and had the rebel Prince of Ning executed there. The Portuguese embassy had also become aware that ambassadors from the exiled King of Malacca were sent to Beijing seeking assistance from the Chinese emperor in expelling the conquering Portuguese so that their king could be reinstalled there. The Portuguese also knew of two officials in the Censorate—Qiu Daolong and He Ao— who sent memorials to the throne that condemned the Portuguese conquest of Malacca and that their embassy should be rejected. There were also reports sent to Beijing by Canton officials stating that the Portuguese were bothersome foreigners who sought {{to build their own}} trading post.|$|E

5|$|Dušan was {{succeeded by}} his 19-year-old son Uroš, who {{apparently}} regarded Marko Mrnjavčević {{as a man}} of trust. The new Emperor appointed him the head of the embassy he sent to Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia) at the end of July 1361 to negotiate peace between the empire and the Ragusan Republic after hostilities earlier that year. Although peace was not reached, Marko successfully negotiated the release of Serbian merchants from Prizren who were detained by the Ragusans and was permitted to withdraw silver deposited in the city by his family. The account of that embassy in a Ragusan document contains the earliest-known, undisputed reference to Marko Mrnjavčević. An inscription written in 1356 on <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> a church in the Macedonian region of Tikveš, mentions a Nikola and a Marko as governors in that region, but the identity of this Marko is disputed.|$|E
5|$|In Coffee County, local {{officials}} reported wind gusts had blown a carport into <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> a house. Marengo County received moderate damage, mostly limited to power outages and minor roof and structural {{damage caused by}} fallen trees and powerlines. Many customers were without electric power {{for at least a}} day, and numerous county roads were covered with debris. A person was injured in Dallas County when a tree landed on their car. Five homes and one business were damaged due to high winds, and thousands of people county-wide experienced power outages. Greene County reported hundreds of downed trees and powerlines causing County Roads 148 and 20 and State Highways 11, 43 and 14 to be temporarily closed. In Forkland, a mobile home caught fire when a powerline fell on the home. A motorist ran into a fallen tree in Boligee although did not sustain injuries. In Perry County, 2,200homes were without electric power for several hours, and several vehicles and homes were damaged. A structural fire occurred in Russell County and was believed to be ignited by downed powerlines.|$|E
5|$|Jigsaw then leads Tapp to the asylum's crematorium, {{where he}} informs Tapp {{that some people}} {{actually}} desire his tests, much to Tapp's surprise. At the crematorium is Obi Tate, an arsonist who had put advertisements in the newspaper seeking for Jigsaw to test him. Tapp saves him from a burning furnace, but Obi is still frustrated {{because he wanted to}} survive his own test. Feeling that Tapp is throwing away a gift from Jigsaw, Obi runs away. Tapp then ventures through a theater, where he finds evidence that a former Jigsaw victim being held there. He soon finds that it is Jeff Thomas, the man who was saved by Sing while he and Tapp were in Jigsaw's lair. Jeff has since become suicidal from Tapp's incessant questioning, and has been recaptured by Jigsaw. Tapp saves Thomas from <b>a</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> spikes. Thomas is still frustrated, so he runs away, wounded. As this was the last victim in the asylum, Tapp is free to pursue Jigsaw, but encounters Pighead again. Jigsaw informs Tapp that Pighead wishes to surpass Jigsaw and sabotage Tapp's game, so he must be stopped. Tapp confronts and kills Pighead; Jigsaw rhetorically asks him if he's a murderer, {{in order to get a}} key to proceed.|$|E
