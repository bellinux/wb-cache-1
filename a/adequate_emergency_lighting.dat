40|$|NFPA 101, section 5 - 9 {{mandates}} that, where {{required by}} building classification, all designated emergency egress routes {{be provided with}} <b>adequate</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting</b> {{in the event of}} a normal lighting outage. Emergency lighting is to be arranged so that egress routes are illuminated to an average of 1. 0 footcandle with a minimum at any point of 0. 1 footcandle, as measured at floor level. These levels are permitted to drop to 60 % of their original value over the required 90 minute emergency lighting duration after a power outage. The Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP) has two designations for battery powered egress lights ''Emergency Lights'' are those battery powered lights required by NFPA 101 to provide lighting along officially designated egress routes in those buildings meeting the correct occupancy requirements. Emergency Lights are maintained on a monthly basis by procedure ZSR- 12 N- 001. ''Backup Lights'' are battery powered lights not required by NFPA, but installed in areas where additional light may be needed. The Backup Light locations were identified by PFP Safety and Engineering based on several factors. (1) General occupancy and type of work in the area. Areas occupied briefly during a shiftly surveillance do not require backup lighting while a room occupied fairly frequently or for significant lengths of time will need one or two Backup lights to provide general illumination of the egress points. (2) Complexity of the egress routes. Office spaces with a standard hallway/room configuration will not require Backup Lights while a large room with several subdivisions or irregularly placed rooms, doors, and equipment will require Backup Lights to make egress safer. (3) Reasonable balance between the safety benefits of additional lighting and the man-hours/exposure required for periodic light maintenance. In some plant areas such as building 236 -Z, the additional maintenance time and risk of contamination do not warrant having Backup Lights installed in all rooms. Sufficient light for egress is provided by existing lights located in the hallways...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting</b> is quite {{complicated}} and meeting all standard requirements are often very complex. Rapid {{development in the}} field of LED light sources has brought new possibilities in the design of <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting.</b> In particular, LED has a higher power output in comparison to conventional light sources used in <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting</b> and also the size of LED is smaller. Another advantage is the possibility of optimal routing of LED diodes by means of suitable optics depending on the areas and the type of <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting.</b> Measurements were performed on a prototype of autonomous emergency lamp, which does not use a conventional battery as a source of energy, but super-capacitor. Especially {{from the perspective of a}} long lifespan, its fast charging and reducing of dependence on temperature, the super-capacitor seems like very reliable replacement of batteries previously used...|$|R
