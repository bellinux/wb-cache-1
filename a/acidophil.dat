5000|$|The disease {{associated}} with this increased secretion of cortisol was described by the American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing in 1912, after he was presented with a unique case of the disease in 1910 [...] a 23-year-old woman called Minnie G. whose symptoms included painful obesity, amenorrhea, hypertrichosis (abnormal hair growth), underdevelopment of secondary sexual characteristics, hydrocephalus and cerebral tension. This combination of symptoms was not yet described by any medical disorder at the time. However, Cushing was confident that Minnie’s symptoms were due to dysfunction of the pituitary gland, and resembled those {{associated with}} an adrenal tumor. Given this conviction, and {{his knowledge of the}} three anterior pituitary cell types, Cushing hypothesized that if <b>acidophil</b> hyperpituitarism (excess secretion from the <b>acidophil</b> cells) caused acromegaly, then an excess of basophil cells must be involved in another pituitary disorder that involves sexual dysfunction (amenorrhea in females and erectile dysfunction in males) and could explain Minnie's symptoms. Experimental evidence and case reports by Cushing led to his publication in 1932 on pituitary basophilism as the cause of Cushing's disease. In this publication, the clinical symptoms of the disease, named after Cushing, were described. Out of the 12 cases with hypercortisolism described in Cushing’s monograph on the pituitary body, 67% died within a few years after symptom presentation, whereas Minnie G. survived for more than 40 years after symptom presentation, {{despite the fact that she}} did not receive any treatments for a pituitary tumor. The prolonged survival made Minnie's case unique at the time. The reason behind this survival remains a mystery, since an autopsy of Minnie was refused after her death. However, the most likely explanation, proposed by J. Aidan Carney and based on statistical evidence, was that the basophil adenoma Minnie might have harbored underwent partial infarction, leading to symptom regression. The other hypothesis was that Minnie might have suffered from Primary Pigmented Nodular Adrenocortical Disease (PPNAD), which when associated with Cushing's syndrome (Carney complex) can infrequently cause spontaneous symptom regression of the latter.|$|E

40|$|The 35 adenohypophyses of the White Leghorn cocks were {{prepared}} for this study. Relationship between the cell types and the affinity of dyes was investigated with microspectrophotometrical method. Results obtained {{in this study are}} as follows: 1. Basic four cell types, <b>acidophils,</b> basophils, amphophils and chromophobes, have been distinguished in the pars distalis of the domestic fowl by cytological observation. Basophils of the two types, light and deep, and chromophobes are similarly distributed in both the cephalic and the caudal lobe. Amphophils are confined in the cephalic lobe and two types of <b>acidophils,</b> orange and red, are found only in the caudal lobe. <b>Acidophils</b> are well stained by acid dyes, such as orange G or acid fuchsin. By microspectrophotometry, they are subdivided into two types. The absorption maximum of the cytoplasmic granules stained with those dyes has been observed at the wave length of 480 mμ in one group of <b>acidophils,</b> whereas in the other group has been observed at 543 mμ. 3. Basophils are well stained by basic dyes, such as methyl green or methyl blue. Two types of basophils, light and deep, can be distinguished obviously with PAS-Matsuo tetrachrome stain. Cytoplasmic granules of the light basophils show the absorption maximum at the wave length of 634 mμ, but the granules of the deep basophils show a peak at the wave length of 560 mμ followed by the maximum absorption at 634 mμ. 4. Amphophils are violet or purple in color with the Matsuo-tetrachrome stain. Absorption spectra of the cytoplasmic granules in these cells show that these cells are well stained by acid and basic dyes simultaneously. Three peaks of absorption were recognized at the wave length of 543 mμ, 480 mμ and 415 mμ followed by the maximum absorption at 634 mμ. 5. It was shown that the microspectrophotometrical observations provided more detailed informations in the discrimination of adenohypophyseal cell types than usual histological methods.
