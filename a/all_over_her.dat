5|$|In 1870, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the Senate called the Arctic Resolution, to fund an expedition to the North Pole. Hall, aided by the Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson, successfully lobbied for, and received, a grant of $50,000 from the U.S. Congress to command the expedition and began recruiting personnel in late 1870. He secured the U.S. Navy tugboat Periwinkle, a 387-ton screw-propelled steamer. At the Washington Navy Yard the ship was fitted as a fore topsail schooner, and renamed Polaris. She was prepared for Arctic service by the addition of solid oak timber <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> hull, and the bow was sheathed in iron. A new engine was added, and one of the boilers was retrofitted to burn seal or whale oil.|$|E
5|$|During the 2004 {{crossover}} event , Black Mask commandeers Oracle's {{computers and}} satellites and engages {{in a fight}} to the death with Batman. In order to prevent Batman from killing his adversary, Oracle initiates the Clock Tower's self-destruct sequence, provoking Batman to rescue her rather than continue the battle. This results in the destruction of Gordon's home and headquarters in the clock tower. Subsequently, Oracle decides to move on, and leaves Gotham City altogether. She cuts her ties with Batman, and after a temporary world trip with her team, relocates to Metropolis. In the events comprising Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Between Dark and Dawn (2005), and Birds of Prey: The Battle Within (2005), Oracle is possessed by arch-villain Brainiac, an artificial intelligence entity, in order to become a biological being. Although Oracle overpowers Brainiac and expels him from her body, the advanced virus delivered by him remains despite his absence. The virus steadily causes cybernetic attachments to sprout <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> body. Oracle develops supernatural abilities that allow her to psychically interact with computer information systems. Although she loses these abilities after the virus is rendered dormant following an operation by Doctor Mid-Nite, she discovers she can move her toes. However, this proves to be short-lived; Gordon remains paralyzed.|$|E

5|$|In Bethany, Vermont, a raven frightens {{a little}} girl, Michelle Crittendon, at a park while a neighbor, Jenny Uphouse, watches. The bird is later found at her home. Her mother, Martha Crittendon, is then {{attacked}} {{and killed by}} an unseen monster. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are on a stakeout looking {{for a woman who}} is possibly killing prostitutes. Mulder believes she has the power to disappear because every time police attempt to arrest her she cannot be found. While on lookout, Mulder gets a call about the attack and leaves. Back at the office, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) tells Mulder that Crittendon disappeared and asks him what he knows about ravens. Mulder believes that the bird is usually associated with evil. Skinner tells Mulder that this case is a top priority because Crittendon is the wife of a powerful judge. At the Crittendon home, Martha's husband, Howard, tells Mulder that his wife was cheating on him because he found birth control pills, which is suspicious because Howard has had a vasectomy. Another neighbor, Ellen Adderly, the wife of Sheriff Phil Adderly, is approached by Jenny and then sees a raven before the window of a nearby car shatters. At the Crittendon home, Michelle sees the raven outside her window again and Howard leaves to check it out, leading him to find a hand sticking out above the flower bushes. Later the police dig up Martha's body, with claw marks <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|E
5|$|The outdoor {{scene in}} which Xander sees Buffy in the sandbox was {{intentionally}} overexposed, intensifying the foreground and blowing out the background, making the sky look white; flash frames were also used in the shot of Buffy in the desert. Whedon allowed some shots to last far longer than is common in a television episode; this cinematic technique allowed the images to take on meaning. Highly stylized lighting is used throughout Xander's dream. In the university hallway the scene is lit with green and orange gels, while the almost shot-for-shot re-creation of the Apocalypse Now section is lit with carefully controlled spotlights which allow the background to fall out to black. Whedon cites The Limey as an inspiration for the unnaturally colored university sequence, and had the scene from Apocalypse Now playing on tape during filming to ensure as close a match as possible for that sequence. When Xander is driving the ice cream truck with Anya, the backgrounds outside the car intentionally look fake, to {{give a sense of}} stillness where there should be motion. Whedon originally wanted to use rear-screen projection for the driving scene, but had to utilize greenscreen instead, as rear-screen projection would be difficult to set up on their stages. Some special effects shots came about by accident; in his commentary Whedon explains that when Buffy smeared the mud <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face, it looked as though she was giving herself a facial. He therefore dissolved the shot into a negative image, creating intense colors that made the shot more interesting.|$|E

These showed her in what was described as [...] "some sort of untidy, yet fashionable looking house", while one showed her with her legs above her head wearing [...] "Kandee's caramel kisses shoes" [...] and a third and final seeing her [...] "cosying up next to a handsome chap". [...] The same day, Roberts gave two more exclusive stills to website Digital Spy; in one image, she was smelling roses, while, in the second, she was [...] "playing with a pair of shoes". The video was released on 30 November 2011. After the official release, Nadia Mendoza of the Daily Mail stated the video was a departure from her previous two videos (for [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] and [...] "Lucky Day"), saying that it [...] "looks and sounds a lot more grown up as she teases viewers by stripping to her bra and frolicking in the shower." [...] Mendoza found that Roberts was [...] "becoming quite the chameleon" [...] and had [...] "trampled <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> innocent charm to create a sex siren", referencing her transformation throughout her videos.

After briefly encountering Sasuke during the Chunin Exams, she became addicted to him and decided to join Taka to be at his side. Karin was critically wounded by Sasuke during his battle against Danzo, and after he left her behind, Karin was arrested by Kakashi, in turn meeting Naruto for the first time. She later met up with Sasuke to confront him, but instead immediately forgave him. Sometime after, she seemingly moved on from Sasuke and helped deliver Sasuke and Sakura's daughter Sarada. Karin is a Sensor Type, able to sense other's chakra and feel a person's aura that way, such as seeing Naruto's chakra as [...] "bright and warm". She also can heal people if they bite her, which causes them to absorb chakra, leaving permanent marks <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> body, but due to the risks involved she can only use it once per day. In Japanese, Karin is voiced by Kanako Tōjō up until Episode 485, when Toa Yukinari takes over.
