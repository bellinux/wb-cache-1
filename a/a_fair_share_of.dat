5|$|Chikka Devaraja (r. 1672–1704), {{the most}} notable of Mysore's early kings, who ruled during much of this period, managed to not only survive the exigencies but further {{expanded}} territory. He achieved this by forging strategic alliances with the Marathas and the Mughals. The kingdom soon grew to include Salem and Bangalore to the east, Hassan to the west, Chikkamagaluru and Tumkur {{to the north and}} the rest of Coimbatore to the south. Despite this expansion, the kingdom, which now accounted for <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> land in the southern Indian heartland, extending from the Western Ghats to the western boundaries of the Coromandel plain, remained landlocked without direct coastal access. Chikka Devaraja's attempts to remedy this brought Mysore into conflict with the Nayaka chiefs of Ikkeri and the kings (Rajas) of Kodagu (modern Coorg); who between them controlled the Kanara coast (coastal areas of modern Karnataka) and the intervening hill region respectively. The conflict brought mixed results with Mysore annexing Periyapatna but suffering a reversal at Palupare.|$|E
