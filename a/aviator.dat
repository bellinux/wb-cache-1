40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} {{and analyze the}} prevalence and the influencing factors on retinal arteriosclerosis in civil <b>aviators</b> of different ages. METHODS:Two thousand seven hundred and seventy-eight commissioned civil <b>aviators</b> who received medical examination in Civil Aviation General Hospital from July 2014 to July 2015 were randomly divided into three groups: group A(1 311 <b>aviators</b> aged 22 - 39), group B(618 <b>aviators</b> age 40 - 49), group C(849 <b>aviators</b> age 50 - 59). <b>Aviators</b> over 40 years old, {{were divided into two}} groups: group with retinal atherosclerosis and group without retinal atherosclerosis according to the results of fundus examination. Medical examination data of the <b>aviators</b> were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 2 778 <b>aviators,</b> 334 (12. 02 %) were detected with retinal arteriosclerosis, among which 318 <b>aviators</b> were classified as gradeⅠ, and 16 <b>aviators</b> as grade Ⅱ. The retinal arteriosclerosis prevalence of group A, B, and C increased with age, and the difference was statistically significant(P P CONCLUSION: The prevalence of retinal arteriosclerosis in commissioned civil <b>aviators</b> was 12. 02 %,and most of the retinal arteriosclerosis was classified as grade Ⅰ. In <b>aviators</b> over 40 years old, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, high fasting blood glucose and overweight were important factors in the development of retinal arteriosclerosis...|$|R

40|$|Consensus {{on whether}} {{physical}} condition affects {{the risk of}} gravity-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) has not been reached, and most previous studies about the issue did not include well-experienced <b>aviators.</b> We compared the physical conditions of well-experienced young <b>aviators</b> according to the occurrence of G-LOC during human centrifuge training. Among 361 young male <b>aviators</b> on active flight duty with experience in high performance aircrafts for at least 2 years, 350 had full data available and were reviewed in this study. We divided the <b>aviators</b> into the G-LOC group and the non-G-LOC group according to their human centrifuge training results. We then compared their basic characteristics, body composition, physical fitness level, and pulmonary function. Twenty nine <b>aviators</b> (8. 3 %) who experienced G-LOC during human centrifuge training in their first trials were classified into the G-LOC group. There {{was no difference in}} physical condition of <b>aviators</b> between the two groups. Young <b>aviators</b> with experience in G-LOC showed no difference in physical condition such as muscle mass, strength, and general endurance from the <b>aviators</b> with no such experience. Although more studies are needed, physical condition {{does not seem to be}} a significant determinant of G-LOC among the experienced <b>aviators...</b>|$|R

The <b>Aviators</b> hosted game one as the fourth seed and were {{trailing}} 3-0 headed into the third period. Scoring four unanswered goals, the <b>Aviators</b> held a 4-3 lead until three seconds remained where the Whalers scored a disputed goal. The net was apparently not lined with the crease and play should have been whistled dead. The <b>Aviators</b> eventually lost game one in overtime. The series shifted to Danbury, the third seed, for the final two games. The <b>Aviators</b> won game two but lost 5-4 in overtime to the Whalers in game three.|$|R

50|$|With the Sportimes {{finishing}} with WTT's worst record in 2013, the <b>Aviators</b> had the top pick in each round of both WTT drafts. With the first overall selection in the marquee player draft, the <b>Aviators</b> chose Bob and Mike Bryan {{whom they had}} protected as a doubles team. Thus, the identical twins simultaneously became the first players who could call themselves San Diego <b>Aviators.</b> With the first pick {{in the second round}} of the marquee player draft (ninth overall), the <b>Aviators</b> selected Daniela Hantuchová who committed to playing in WTT full-time for the 2014 season. The <b>Aviators</b> protected Květa Peschke, making her the only holdover player from the 2013 Sportimes on the 2014 Aviators' roster. With the first pick in the first round of the roster player draft, the <b>Aviators</b> selected Somdev Devvarman. They used their second round choice for Raven Klaasen. With Hantuchová committed to playing full-time, the <b>Aviators</b> knew they did not need all four of their picks in the roster draft. They also knew they could wait until the fourth round to take Peschke whom they had protected. So, the <b>Aviators</b> traded their third round pick to the Springfield Lasers in exchange for the Lasers' fourth round pick and cash consideration. The Lasers used the pick they acquired from the <b>Aviators</b> to select Michael Russell. Russell went on to have the highest winning percentage in men's singles in WTT in 2014. He also won the opening set of men's singles in the Western Conference Championship Match against the <b>Aviators</b> and paired with Ross Hutchins to serve out the match against the Bryan Brothers and eliminate the <b>Aviators.</b> The <b>Aviators</b> used their fourth round pick (22nd overall) to draft Peschke and passed on the fourth round pick (27th overall) that they acquired in the trade with the Lasers, since their roster was full.|$|R

25|$|James Blake, {{who played}} for the team as a {{wildcard}} in 2015, was assigned by WTT to <b>Aviators</b> as a designated player. The <b>Aviators</b> did not protect 2015 marquee player Madison Keys. In the roster portion of the draft, the <b>Aviators</b> protected Raven Klaasen and Darija Jurak. They chose Shelby Rogers with their first-round selection, leaving 2015 amateur and winner of the 2015 US Open boys' singles title, but now turned professional, Taylor Fritz unprotected. The protection of Jurak and the selection of Rogers also meant that the <b>Aviators</b> could not protect Květa Peschke, the last remaining {{member of the team}} {{who played for}} the franchise when it was known as the New York Sportimes, and Chanelle Scheepers. The <b>Aviators</b> chose Daniel Evans with their third-round selection in the roster player portion of the draft.
