5|$|Arsenal {{endured a}} poor {{start to the}} 1971–72 season, {{and as a result}} Mee {{purchased}} Alan Ball, Jr. from Everton for £220,000. They went on to go 14 games unbeaten over the winter, closing the gap on leaders Manchester City to four points. They were knocked out of the European Cup at the quarter-final stage by eventual winners Ajax. They ended the season in fifth place, and gifted Derby County the league title by denying Liverpool what would have proved to be a decisive victory on the penultimate day of the season. Arsenal returned to Wembley to defend the FA Cup, but lost 1–0 to Leeds United; Kennedy had lost his first team place late in the season after fatigue began to affect his form, and was only named as <b>a</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final before he came on for Radford after 73 minutes. Kennedy scored 19 goals in 55 appearances to finish as the club's top goalscorer for the second successive season.|$|E
5|$|Born in Dublin, O'Dea {{played for}} Home Farm {{before he was}} signed by Celtic as a teenager.

A month later, O'Dea made his league debut against Inverness Caledonian Thistle, where he played the last thirty minutes after substituting for Gary Caldwell. His UEFA Champions League debut was on 6 December against Danish club F.C. Copenhagen as <b>a</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> injured Stephen McManus. O'Dea made his first league starting appearance against Dunfermline Athletic four days after his Champions League debut. Later that month he scored his first goal in a match against Dundee United, with his rebound of a 78th-minute free kick by Shunsuke Nakamura tying the match 2–2. O'Dea's first season saw him also score against Livingston in the run to the 2006–07 Scottish Cup.|$|E
5|$|Groningen placed Robben {{in their}} first team for the 1999–2000 season. He scored three goals in league play.

During the winter, Robben managed to play himself into the {{starting}} lineup. In 18starts for Groningen over the 2000–01 season, he scored two goals. Robben was named player of the year for his first season with the club, and with teammate Jordi Hoogstrate, he demonstrated the strength of the Groningen youth academy. Robben stayed with Groningen and improved steadily during the 2001–02 season, playing in 28matches and scoring six goals. Robben transferred to PSV for €3.9million before the 2002–03 season.|$|E

5|$|Ingham was on {{the bench}} for Northern Ireland as they beat England 1–0 in a 2006 FIFA World Cup {{qualifier}} on 7 September 2005. He received call ups for friendlies against Portugal in November 2005 and Estonia in March 2006, although he only made the bench for both matches. He was named by Northern Ireland in their end-of-season tour of the United States in May 2006, starting in the 1–0 defeat against Uruguay at the Giants Stadium on 21 May. By November 2006, he had established himself as Northern Ireland's third-choice goalkeeper behind Taylor and Carroll. Ingham came on as <b>a</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second half of Northern Ireland's 0–0 draw against Wales in a friendly on 6 February 2007, giving him his third and most recent international cap.|$|E
5|$|Petticoats made of {{horsehair}} crinoline appeared around 1839, proving {{so successful}} that the name 'crinoline' began to refer to supportive petticoats in general, rather than solely to the material. By 1847, crinoline fabric was {{being used as a}} stiffening for skirt linings, although English women preferred separate crinoline fabric petticoats which were beginning to collapse under the increasing weight of the skirts. One alternative to horsehair crinoline was the quilted petticoat stuffed with down or feathers, such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by Lady Aylesbury. However, quilted skirts were not widely produced until the early 1850s. In about 1849, it was possible to buy stiffened and corded cotton fabric for making petticoats, marketed as 'crinoline,' and designed as <b>a</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> horsehair textile. The artificial crinoline with hoops did not emerge until the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|The Cup Final playoff format had changed. There were semi-finals {{against the}} PCHA champion, {{followed}} by the final against the WCHL champion. In the Cup semi-finals, Ottawa again faced Vancouver (now known as the Maroons) in Vancouver. New attendance records were set during this series, with 9,000 for the first game and 10,000 for the second. Ottawa won the series with scores of 1–0, 1–4, 3–2, and 4–1, with Benedict getting the shutout and Harry Broadbent scoring five goals. The Senators next had to play Edmonton in a best-of-three series and won it in two games with scores of 2–1 and 1–0, with Broadbent scoring the winning goal. The second game of the finals is famous for being the game in which King Clancy (then only <b>a</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> team) played all positions, including goal.

5|$|No new {{gameplay}} {{content was}} added to Type-0 HD. The team instead focused on upgrading the graphics, adjusting existing gameplay for home consoles, and including a lower difficulty level. The latter was due to complaints from players that the original game was too difficult. While carrying over the original's multiplayer functions was considered, it would have lengthened the estimated development time by another year. Since Tabata's priority was to bring the game to fans worldwide, the multiplayer and associated elements were either removed or incorporated into the single-player campaign. Tabata also decided against creation of a demo or an international version for this reason. As <b>a</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> multiplayer, the team strengthened and improved the original single-player Academy Assistance function. As with the original, the team used the names of developers from both the core team and other Square Enix departments for the NPCs. While the main story remained unchanged, a secret cutscene teasing future Type games was commissioned. Created by Square Enix's CGI movie subsidiary Visual Works, {{it was based on}} some of Tabata's early ideas for Type-0. A small piece of the cutscene was shown privately to attendees of Square Enix's 25th anniversary commemoration event for the Final Fantasy series. Hiroki Chiba, writer for Type-0, returned to write the scene. In the cutscene, a fatally-wounded samurai warrior resembling main protagonist Ace is saved from death by a fire spirit.|$|E
5|$|On 9 June 2006, Valbuena {{signed his}} first {{professional}} contract after agreeing to a transfer to Olympique de Marseille.

Valbuena made his professional debut for the club on 15 July 2006 in the team's third round match against Ukrainian club Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk in the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup. He subsequently struggled {{to meet the demands}} of training and suffered an ankle injury in the pre-season period, which resulted in the player missing the start of the 2006–07 season. Valbuena made his league debut on 19 November 2006 in a league match against Valenciennes appearing as a substitute in the team's 1–0 victory. He appeared as <b>a</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> majority of the season and even spent some time playing on the club's reserve team in the fifth division. On 19 May 2007, Valbuena scored his first professional goal in a 2–1 victory over Saint-Étienne. The game-winning goal allowed the club to maintain control of second place, which merited Marseille a spot in the UEFA Champions League for the first time since the 2003–04 season.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being born}} in Lagos, Nigeria, Odubade {{grew up in}} East Sussex. He {{attended}} The Bishop Bell School in Eastbourne. He began his football career in England, playing in the Sussex County League for Eastbourne Town in 2002. He scored over 70 times in just two seasons at the East Sussex club in all competitions, before attracting the attention of then–Yeovil Town manager Gary Johnson {{before the start of}} the 2004–05 season, he subsequently joined the club on a one-year contract in July 2004 after a successful trial. He made his debut as <b>a</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Somerset side in a 4–3 defeat against Torquay United in the Football League Trophy in September 2004. He made his second Yeovil appearance in a 3–1 victory away at Histon in an FA Cup tie, scoring his only goal for the club deep into injury-time. He made a further four appearances for the side, before leaving the club in February 2005 due to personal reasons, and subsequently joined Conference South side Eastbourne Borough two days later. Odubade made his Eastbourne Borough debut in the club's 2–0 victory against Basingstoke Town just three days after signing for the club, playing 45 minutes of the match. In the following game, he scored twice as Eastbourne came from back from a two-goal deficit to draw 2–2 at Cambridge City, scoring both goals within the space of five minutes. Odubade made it five goals in his first three games for Eastbourne, as he scored a hat-trick in the club's 4–0 home victory against Thurrock. He also scored Eastbourne's third goal in a 3–1 win in the following game against Newport County, latching onto a long ball and beating the goalkeeper first time. Throughout March 2005, Odubade scored in four consecutive games, netting against Cambridge City, Havant & Waterlooville, Sutton United, and Hayes to take his tally to ten goals for the club. He also provided the assists for two of Eastbourne's goals in a 3–0 win against Redbridge, and scored two goals in late April 2005 against Bishop's Stortford and Weston-Super-Mare respectively. He scored his last goal of the season in Eastbourne's 3–0 away win against Cambridge City in the play-off, and was in the side that lost 2–1 to Altrincham in the final. Odubade made a total of 17 appearances for Eastbourne during the second half of the 2004–05 campaign, scoring 13 times.|$|E
