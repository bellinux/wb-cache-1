5000|$|A {{turbocharged}} {{version was}} introduced as the pace {{car at the}} 1976 Indianapolis 500, and a production turbo arrived in 1978. The turbo 3.8 received sequential fuel injection and a distributorless wasted spark ignition system in 1984. In 1986 an <b>air-to-air</b> Garrett <b>intercooler</b> was added and the RPO Code became LC2. The LC2 engine has a bore of 3.80" [...] and a stroke of 3.40". The respective horsepower ratings for 1986 & 1987 were 235 hp (175 kW) & 245 hp (183 kW). The limited production GNX benefitted from additional factory modifications such as a ceramic turbocharger, more efficient Garrett intercooler, low restriction exhaust system and revised programming {{which resulted in a}} 276 hp (206 kW) factory rating.|$|R
50|$|The {{fourth-generation}} engine uses {{a proprietary}} CT15B turbocharger. This generation {{was used in}} the 1997-2002 ST215 Caldina GT-T AWD Wagon. The exhaust housing is actually cast into the cylinder exhaust manifold, rather than the normal practice of a separate turbine housing after the cylinder exhaust manifold. Due to this, the CT15 is backwards compatible with the third-generation 3S-GTE cylinder head only, not either the first or second generation. Intake charge was cooled by an <b>air-to-air</b> top-mounted <b>intercooler</b> fed through a new side-feed intake manifold. This generation utilizes a coil-on-plug ignition system and 550cc injectors. Boost remains at 13-14psi, however overboost fuel cut is increased to 21psi. Compression is increased to 9:1 and produces 260PS (256 hp) and 324N·m (239 lb-ft).|$|R
50|$|The 2JZ-GTE {{originally}} powered the Toyota Aristo V (JZS147) in 1991 {{before becoming}} Toyota's flagship performance engine in the Toyota Supra RZ (JZA80). Its mechanical basis was the existing 2JZ-GE, but differed {{in its use}} of sequential twin turbochargers and an <b>air-to-air</b> side-mounted <b>intercooler.</b> The engine block, crankshaft, and connecting rods of the Supra's 2JZ-GE and 2JZ-GTE are the same, with notable differences being that the 2JZ-GTE has recessed piston tops (giving a lower compression ratio), oil spray nozzles to aid in cooling the pistons and a different head (redesigned inlet/exhaust ports, cams and valves). However, other 2JZ-GE equipped models (Aristo, Altezza, Mark II) share a different part number for connecting rods. Toyota's VVT-i variable valve timing technology {{was added to the}} engine beginning in September 1997, hence it phased out the original engine. Consequently, maximum torque and horsepower was raised for engines selling in all markets.|$|R
50|$|The changes {{include a}} {{significantly}} larger <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler</b> {{to deliver a}} cooler, denser charge; a larger air filter box for increased airflow; larger diameter exhaust downpipe; and an uprated fuel pump, along with an updated software calibration to optimise {{the performance of the}} revised engine.|$|E

50|$|By {{applying}} twin KO4 Warner turbochargers, an <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler,</b> {{and variable}} valve actuation to its Alloytec 190, then dropping the compression to 9.0:1, Holden engineers {{were able to}} deliver a power peak of 280 kW and no less than 480Nm of torque, with 90% available from just 1600 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fifth-generation}} engine {{uses the}} same turbo as the fourth generation model. This generation {{was used in the}} 2002-2007 ST246 Caldina GT-Four AWD Wagon. There are only minor differences to this engine compared to the previous version and due to only limited markets receiving the ST246, very little is known and very few are aware of the engine. Differences include longer of the injectors to be closer to the intake ports. The intake manifold returns to a center-feed type fed by an <b>air-to-air</b> top-mounted <b>intercooler.</b> This intercooler is slightly smaller than the previous generation and is oriented slightly different than any of the previous generations. It is tilted more towards the front of the car. The coil-on-plug ignition is different in this generation and it is not compatible with the ST215 ECU. The valve cover is different as {{for the first time in}} the 3S-GTE series as the oil filler hole is on top of the exhaust camshaft instead of the intake. Other differences include the first time that there is no oil cooler in this generation as well as OBD2 diagnostics. Despite the downsize in various components of this generation, power is retained at 260PS (256 hp) and 324N·m (239 lb-ft).|$|R
5000|$|After {{the second}} race, the CSI rule makers {{insisted that the}} [...] "whale tail" [...] hood of the road-going 930 must fit on the race car. The <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler</b> setup under the rear hood had to be altered to a more compact air-to-water layout, which cost Porsche several weeks of testing and half a million Deutsche marks.|$|E
5000|$|The 3S-GTE in the GT-Four {{features}} an <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler</b> and CT26 twin entry turbo to eliminate exhaust gas interference. The Japanese market GT-Four has [...] {{of power and}} 304 Nm of torque, a result of more aggressive ignition advance and ceramic turbine. The Full-time 4WD system in the GT-Four has viscous coupling limited slip center differential and some models are equipped with a Torsen rear differential.|$|E
50|$|Like the WRX, the B4 uses a bonnet scoop {{to feed a}} top-mount <b>air-to-air</b> <b>{{intercooler}}.</b> Manufactured by Sanden, the intercooler has {{an effective}} depth of 73 mm, a width of 140 mm and a length of 370 mm. With 26 tubes to take induction air from one end-tank to the other, the unit has a 13.37 kW heat transfer capacity and reduces 120-130 degree Celsius charge air to 70-80 degrees Celsius (claimed).|$|E
5000|$|Starting {{with the}} 1994 model year, Toyota {{attempted}} to rectify engine performance by fitting a Roots-type supercharger with <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler,</b> providing six psi of boost (these models were called the [...] "S/C"), bringing {{the engine power}} up to a competitive [...] and increasing fuel mileage from 17 to 23 mpg. Initially, the S/C engine was only available as an option on the LE for the 1994 model year and all models for 1995.|$|E
50|$|Its 3G81 three-cylinder engine has a {{displacement}} of 548 cubic centimetres and features three intake valves and two exhaust valves incorporated into each cylinder. The valves {{are controlled by}} twin overhead camshafts through roller cam followers on finger rockers with hydraulic automatic lash adjusters. Gasoline is electronically injected through triple-jet nozzles (also a technological first). The water-cooled turbocharger operates through an <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler.</b> The ignition timing advance is also controlled electronically, and a knock-sensing system is included.|$|E
50|$|A 2.0 L (1998 cc) {{turbocharged}} {{direct injection}} {{version of the}} gen III Ecotec was available in the 2013 Cadillac ATS and Chevrolet Malibu.This engine is also available in Cadillac XTS in Chinese market. Bore and stroke are both 86.0 mm, compression is 9.5:1. The engine uses twin-scroll turbocharger with electronically controlled wastegate/bypass valve, <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler,</b> stainless steel dual-scroll (1-4, 2-3) exhaust manifold designed to withstand 980 C turbine temperature, and rotacast aluminum alloy (A356T6) cylinder head with sodium-filled exhaust valves. Maximum engine speed is listed at 7000 RPM.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{enhancements}} {{were made}} for 1984, most notably the addition of an <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler</b> allowing the compression ratio to be increased from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1 with revised turbocharger exhaust housing to the FJ20ET powered model increasing output to [...] of power at 6,400 rpm (gross) and 245 Nm of torque at 4400 rpm. The intercooled model was nicknamed the Turbo C. The Turbo C {{formed the basis for}} the Super Silhouette race car built by GT-R Works and sponsored by Tomica and run in the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship under FIA Group C regulations.|$|E
5000|$|It {{utilizes}} {{a single}} turbocharger with a turbine housing size of 1.15 A/R. In 1999, an <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler</b> {{was added to}} cool the charged air from the turbo for increased air density. With the new cooler, denser air would increase the horsepower potential of the engine, while also reducing exhaust gas temperatures (EGT). Eventually, the turbine housing was changed to a [...]84 A/R and a wastegate was added. With larger injectors, the HPOP output was increased by utilizing a 17° swash plate angle {{to meet the requirements}} of the new, higher flowing injectors.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "Turbo" [...] {{variant of}} the first {{generation}} Vios was made available in Thailand only, boasting a turbocharged 1.5 litre engine with an <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler</b> that produces 143 PS with light boost at 6400 rpm with 196 Nm of torque. It goes from 0 - 100 km/h in 8.1 seconds. Only about 600 limited units were produced. Standard on the Vios Turbo are a functional scoop on its hood, wrap-around body kits, stiffer springs, firmer shock-absorbers and 16" [...] alloys. Colours available were only red, black and silver. The transmission ratio and differential ratio were based on that of a Toyota MR-S.|$|E
5000|$|The RS Turbo's CVH engine {{retained}} the same 1597cc capacity as the XR2i, {{but had a}} lower compression ratio of 8:1. The Garrett T2 turbocharger supplied [...] of boost and was chosen as space between the engine and radiator prevented {{the use of the}} larger T3 from the Escort RS Turbo. As with the Escort, an <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler</b> was fitted, although this was slightly larger on the Fiesta. The quoted power output was 133ps at 5500rpm, with 183 nm of torque at 2400rpm which gave the car a top speed of 133 mph and a 0-60 of 7.9 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{generation}} 1JZ-GTE employs twin CT12A turbochargers arranged in parallel and blowing through a side-mount or front mount <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler.</b> With an 8.5:1 static compression ratio, the factory quoted {{power and torque}} outputs are [...] at 6200 rpm and 363 Nm at 4800 rpm. The bore and stroke {{are the same as}} for the 1JZ-GE: 86 mm bore × 71.5 mm stroke. Yamaha may have had a hand in the development or production of these engines (possibly the head design), hence the Yamaha badging on certain parts of the engine, such as the cam gear cover. In 1991, the 1JZ-GTE was slotted into the all-new Soarer GT.|$|E
50|$|Two {{decades later}} in 2011, BBR now offer a {{turn-key}} refurbishment package for old NA MX-5's, again including a turbo charger kit. This now increases power output to , and produces 175 ftlb Nm of torque. The estimated top speed is now 140 mph, with 0-60 approached in 5.5 seconds. The turbo charger used is the Garrett GT25 ball race unit, and the package also includes an <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler,</b> and a digital piggy-back ECU to control timing, fueling, and boost pressures. Subject to a satisfactory donor car, the refurbishment and turbo upgrade package includes rust treatment, a paint respray, new seats, wheels, and other trim. As of January 2011 {{the cost for}} a 'refreshed' BBR MX-5 Turbo is £7,500.|$|E
50|$|The F6 {{is based}} on the modern-classic Ford Falcon XR6 Turbo sports sedan. The F6 engine {{is based on}} XR6T motor, a {{turbocharged}} intercooled DOHC 4.0L Inline Six with VCT, but includes: a modified FPV airbox (with Dual Ram Air intakes), higher strength conrods, larger <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler,</b> high flow exhaust system, higher capacity fuel pump, and a Garrett GT3582r (same as the BA/BF XR6T) turbocharger with an internal waste gate (up from the GT3576r on the FG XR6T)running 0.64 bar of boost on the BA/BF models and 0.91 on the FG. This engine is known for its wide, flat torque curve, with peak torque of 565 Nm available from 1950 to 5250 rpm(FG F6). This equates to strong acceleration throughout the rev range.|$|E
5000|$|The F2T is a {{turbocharged}} {{version of}} the F2 equipped with an IHI-supplied RHB5 VJ11 turbocharger and an <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler.</b> Internally the engine retains its 86 mm bore and 94 mm stroke, but has a lower compression ratio of 7.8:1. It produces 145 hp (108 kW) at 4300 rpm and [...] It is rumored that this figure was produced at the drive wheels, as this engine was suspected to be under-rated. However Mazda had only ever quoted these figures as SAE Net and DIN which are crankshaft rating standards, as required by law in the countries where the cars were sold. Due to the increased torque output, Mazda was forced to increase {{the strength of the}} transmission for the F2T, producing the H-type, the strongest FWD gearbox Mazda produced at the time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{turbocharged}} Tipo F106 N 000 V8 was {{evolved from}} the 208 Turbo's engine, chiefly by adding an intercooler and adopting a new turbocharger.Displacement was unchanged, at 1991 cc with a bore and stroke of 66.8 mm&thinsp;×&thinsp;71 mm; there were four overhead camshafts driving two valves per cylinder; Bosch K-jetronic mechanical fuel injection was carried over from the 208. Whereas 208 Turbos had used a KKK turbocharger, these new 328-based cars used a water-cooled IHI unit running at [...] of boost. Charge air was cooled by a Behr <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler</b> mounted {{on top of the}} engine. Output was [...] at 6,500 rpm and 328 Nm at 4,100 rpm; maximum torque was reached at engine speeds 700 rpm lower than on the 208 Turbo, making the engine more flexible.|$|E
50|$|The 930 proved {{very fast}} but also very {{demanding}} to drive fast, {{and due to}} its short wheelbase and rear engine layout, was prone to oversteer and turbo-lag. Porsche made its first and most significant changes to the 930 for 1978, enlarging the engine to 3.3 litres and adding an <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler.</b> By cooling the pressurized air charge, the intercooler helped increase power to 300 hp (DIN); the rear 'whale tail' spoiler was re-profiled and raised slightly {{to make room for}} the intercooler. Porsche also upgraded the brakes to units similar to those used on the 917 racecar. While the increase in displacement and addition of an intercooler increased power output and torque, these changes also increased the weight of the vehicle, especially to the engine, which contributed to a substantial change in the handling and character of the car when compared to the earlier 3.0 litre models.|$|E
5000|$|GM built Jay Leno his own Camaro, the Jay Leno Camaro {{is powered}} by the 3.6 L direct-injected V6 similar to the unit that resides in stock LS and LT models, but has an {{additional}} pair of Turbonetics T-3 turbochargers which produces [...] {{with the help of}} a custom <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler</b> that feeds 7 pounds of boost into the engine. The extra performance is added with virtually no penalty in fuel economy. Besides the power upgrades, the vehicle also gets an upgraded Centerforce clutch and pressure plate for the six-speed manual transmission, an upgraded Be-Cool radiator, Brembo 6-piston brake package, a Pedders coil-over lowering kit, and a bodykit that includes a new rear diffuser as well as a revised front fascia and hood with additional venting for brakes and engine. This Camaro concept has yet to be announced for any type of production release but its design is being used for the Bumblebee representation in the new Transformers 3 movie set which was released in the summer of 2011.|$|E
5000|$|The fifth {{generation}} Celica {{was introduced}} in September 1989 for the 1990 model year. The Celica received new Super Round organic styling, upgraded wheels and tires, more powerful GT-Four (All-Trac Turbo in the US) with better cooling system, and for the Japanese market only, the four-wheel steering (4WS) models. Toyota engineers claimed that the round styling and lack of straight edges increased strength without adding weight. The styling was later copied by other manufacturers. Japanese market models were now S-R, Z-R, GT-R, Active Sports (first Toyota with Toyota Active Control Suspension), and GT-Four. The S-R and Z-R were powered by a 3S-FE engine, while the GT-R and Active Sports came with a 3S-GE. The 3S-GTE in the GT-Four features an <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler</b> and CT26 twin entry turbo to eliminate exhaust gas interference. The Japanese market GT-Four has [...] and 304 Nm of torque, a result of more aggressive ignition advance and ceramic turbine. The Full-time 4WD system in the GT-Four has viscous coupling limited slip center differential and Torsen rear differential.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, Ford {{revealed}} the new Focus RS in [...] "concept" [...] form at the British International Motor Show. The Duratec RS engine was upgraded to produce [...] and 440 Nm of torque. 0 to 100 km/h acceleration was quoted {{to be under}} 6 seconds. The RS uses a modified Volvo -engineered 2,522cc five-cylinder engine found in the Focus ST. A larger Borg Warner K16 turbo now delivers up to 20.3-psi of boost, exactly double that of the 225-hp ST's engine. A new <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler</b> has been developed as a complement, while the forged crankshaft, silicon-aluminum pistons, graphite-coated cylinder bores, 8.5:1 compression ratio and variable valve timing also up the power output. The car remains front wheel drive, but to reduce torque steer uses a Quaife Automatic Torque Biasing LSD, and a specially designed MacPherson strut suspension at the front called RevoKnuckle, which provides a lower scrub radius and kingpin offset than traditional designs while avoiding the increased weight and complexity of double wishbone and multi-link suspension setups. Ford UK claim: [...] "It's as close as you'll come to driving a full-spec rally car (Ford Focus RS WRC).|$|E
50|$|The second-generation Toyota CT26 used a twin entry {{turbine housing}} with dual {{wastegate}} ports. It was fitted {{to the second}} generation ST185 Toyota Celica GT-Four {{as well as the}} SW20 MR2 Turbo. The intake charge is cooled by an <b>air-to-air</b> <b>intercooler</b> either top-mounted in the Celica or side-mounted in the MR2. The rally homologation Celica (known as Group A Rallye in Australia, RC in Japan and Carlos Sainz Limited Edition in Europe) used a top-mounted water-to-air intercooler and is distinguished by a hood vent rather than a hood scoop as found in the non-homologation ST185s. This generation retains the T-VIS intake manifold and the Air Flow Meter. A factory BPV is included in the SW20 MR2 Turbo but not on the Celicas. Compression ratio is 8.8:1 and produces 200-232HP and 200-224 lb-ft. This generation retains the injector size and throttle body size from the previous generation. However, boost is increased to 10-11psi in the ST185 and MR2 while it is increased to 16psi in the ST185RC. Intake and exhaust valve lift is significantly increased to 8.2mm. This generation also is known for the infamous Hose from Hell (HFH) and Hose from Hell on Earth (HFHOE) as two small coolant hoses are known to require replacement sometime after 100k miles and is sandwiched in all directions by components.|$|E
