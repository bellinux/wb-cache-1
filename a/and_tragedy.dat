5|$|A passionate {{advocate}} of evolutionary theory, Gould wrote prolifically on the subject, {{trying to communicate}} his understanding of contemporary evolutionary biology to a wide audience. A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and evolutionary thought. He was also an enthusiastic baseball fan and sabermetrician (analyst of baseball statistics), and made frequent reference to the sport in his essays. Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book Triumph <b>and</b> <b>Tragedy</b> in Mudville (2003).|$|E
5|$|Classical thinkers {{employed}} classification {{as a way}} {{to define}} and assess the quality of poetry. Notably, the existing fragments of Aristotle's Poetics describe three genres of poetry—the epic, the comic, and the tragic—and develop rules to distinguish the highest-quality poetry in each genre, based on the underlying purposes of the genre. Later aestheticians identified three major genres: epic poetry, lyric poetry, and dramatic poetry, treating comedy <b>and</b> <b>tragedy</b> as subgenres of dramatic poetry.|$|E
5|$|In his {{monograph}} Project Apollo: The Tough Decisions, Deputy Administrator Seamans {{wrote that}} NASA's single worst mistake in engineering judgment {{was not to}} run a fire test on the Command Module before the plugs-out test. In the first episode of the 2009 BBC documentary series NASA: Triumph <b>and</b> <b>Tragedy,</b> Jim McDivitt said that NASA {{had no idea how}} a 100% oxygen atmosphere would influence burning. Similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in the 2007 documentary film In the Shadow of the Moon.|$|E

5|$|Shakespeare's {{use of his}} poetic {{dramatic}} structure (especially effects such as switching between comedy <b>and</b> <b>tragedy</b> {{to heighten}} tension, his expansion of minor characters, and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story) has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill. The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters, sometimes changing the form as the character develops. Romeo, for example, grows more adept at the sonnet {{over the course of}} the play.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Eastwood {{teamed up}} with Jeff Bridges and George Kennedy in the buddy action caper Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, a road movie about a veteran bank robber Thunderbolt (Eastwood) and a young con man drifter, Lightfoot (Bridges). On its release, in spring 1974, the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high {{suspense}} <b>and</b> <b>tragedy</b> but was only a modest success at the box office, earning $32.4million. Eastwood's acting was noted by critics, but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Eastwood reportedly fumed {{at the lack of}} Academy Award recognition for him and swore that he would never work for United Artists again.|$|E
5|$|While Gascoigne was {{successful}} {{on the football}} field, his childhood was marked by instability <b>and</b> <b>tragedy.</b> Initially his family lived in a single upstairs room in a council house with a shared bathroom, and moved several times during Gascoigne's early life. When he was ten, Gascoigne witnessed the death of Steven Spraggon, the younger brother of a friend, {{who was killed in}} a traffic collision. Around this time, his father began to suffer from seizures. Gascoigne began developing obsessions and twitches, and was taken into therapy at age ten, but soon quit the therapy sessions after his father expressed doubts over the treatment methods.|$|E

25|$|Playwrights {{throughout}} history have looked to Plautus for character, plot, humor, {{and other elements}} of comedy.

The most famous of these successors is Shakespeare—Plautus had {{a major influence on}} the Bard's early comedies.|$|E
