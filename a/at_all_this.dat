5|$|Critics {{have complained}} that, by museum {{display of the}} remains, the body of Lindow Man has been {{objectified}} rather than treated with the respect due the dead. Emma Restall Orr, a neo-druid, has questioned whether the body should be displayed <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> {{is part of a}} wider discussion about the scientific treatment of human remains and museum researchers and archaeologists using them as information sources.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, {{ground fog}} again {{frustrated}} reinforcement. Thirty-five gliders of the 3rd lift carrying the Polish glider borne elements were delayed in taking {{off and the}} whole parachute brigade failed to take off <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> would have serious consequences on the ground when the delayed gliders arrived.|$|E
5|$|Tributary {{missions}} from vassal {{states were}} commonly allowed to include traders, who thus gained opportunities {{to do business}} in the capital markets. No doubt a large proportion of what the Chinese court chose to call tributary missions were in fact shrewdly organized commercial ventures by foreign merchants with no diplomatic status <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> was unquestionably the case, most notably, with a group of traders who appeared on the south coast in 166 AD claiming to be envoys from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.|$|E

5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them {{to the story of}} how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact ancient burial mounds (a part of the necropolis of antic Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results are not at all clear, and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield. If Zibold's condenser worked <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>this</b> was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it could never have produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.|$|E
5|$|Between late 2005–2006 Hwang {{was accused}} {{of a series of}} misconducts. The first {{allegations}} related to his work prior to Snuppy; the claim that he had successfully cloned a human embryo. The charges alleged Hwang had paid for egg donations and that some of eggs came from his employees, which constitute serious breaches of the code of bioethics. It was later found that photographs he published did not depict what was suggested and that most of the stem-cell lines he claimed to have created were not clones <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> brought serious doubts onto the validity of Snuppy, which Hwang consistently claimed was a genuine clone. Hwang hired HumanPass Inc., a Korean DNA lab to investigate Snuppy, who found that Snuppy was authentic. The findings by HumanPass were dismissed {{on the grounds that they}} were employed by Hwang, and a panel at the Seoul National University ordered their own investigation. The investigation found that, despite his fabrications in previous projects, Hwang's research related to Snuppy was accurate and Snuppy was a clone of the adult Afghan hound. As a result of his forgeries, Hwang was indicted for fraud and dismissed from the university.|$|E
5|$|On October 28, Persis Khambatta {{was hired}} to portray Ilia. She had been {{required}} to wear a bald cap for her screen test, although {{at this point the}} character also wore elaborate headgear in some footage. Roddenberry was insistent on this as a character attribute, but others such as Eisner hated the idea of a bald female character. His notes said that while a bald female character would be an interesting addition, it may prevent the audience from feeling at ease with Ilia and so the style may need to be given to a different character entirely. The auditions by this time were not held under the pretence that they were to play a part in a television series, but were openly talking about Star Trek becoming a feature film. The casting for Willard Decker had been delayed, both because of a slight delay in the production but also because the writers were no longer sure that the character was needed <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> was despite auditions being conducted {{at the same time that}} Gautreaux was cast as Xon, during which, in his second audition with Barrett, he also read lines against ten actors competing for the role of Decker.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} Hellenistic Period (323–31 BCE) when a thorough-going skepticism came {{to dominate the}} Academy, the inheritance of Plato's unwritten doctrines could attract little interest (if they were known <b>at</b> <b>all).</b> <b>This</b> skepticism faded {{by the time of}} Middle Platonism and Neo-Platonism, but the philosophers of this period seem no better informed about the unwritten doctrines than modern scholars.|$|E

25|$|Instead {{of showing}} that the Boolean laws are satisfied, we can instead {{postulate}} a set X, two binary operations on X, and one unary operation, and require that those operations satisfy the laws of Boolean algebra. The elements of X need not be bit vectors or subsets but can be anything <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> leads to the more general abstract definition.|$|E
25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that Libet {{consistently}} referred to a veto of an action that was initiated endogenously. That is, a veto that occurs in the absence of external cues, instead relying on only internal cues (if any <b>at</b> <b>all).</b> <b>This</b> veto may be a different type of veto than the one explored by Kühn and Brass using their decide signal.|$|E
25|$|Hasidic thought {{extends the}} Divine immanence of Kabbalah by holding that God {{is all that}} really exists, all else being {{completely}} undifferentiated from God's perspective. This view {{can be defined as}} monistic panentheism. According to this philosophy, God's existence is higher than anything that this world can express, yet he includes all things of this world within his Divine reality in perfect unity, so that the Creation effected no change in him <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> paradox is dealt with at length in Chabad texts.|$|E

25|$|In the North Island, {{specimens}} {{of the smaller}} subspecies rufifacies were allegedly collected from the forest districts of Mount Taranaki/Egmont (1856) and the Wairarapa (1868); the unclear history of the latter and the eventual disappearance of both led to suspicions that the bird may not have occurred on the North Island <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> theory has been refuted, however, after ample subfossil bones of the species {{were found in the}} North Island. Sight records exist from Porirua and Te Karaka; according to Māori tradition, the species last occurred in Te Urewera.|$|E
25|$|Nondisjunction usually {{occurs as}} the result of a {{weakened}} mitotic checkpoint, as these checkpoints tend to arrest or delay cell division until all components of the cell are ready to enter the next phase. If a checkpoint is weakened, the cell may fail to 'notice' that a chromosome pair is not lined up on the mitotic plate, for example. In such a case, most chromosomes would separate normally (with one chromatid ending up in each cell), while others could fail to separate <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> would generate a daughter cell lacking a copy and a daughter cell with an extra copy.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of more systematic, abstract thinking is another notable aspect of cognitive development during adolescence. For example, adolescents {{find it easier}} than children to comprehend the sorts of higher-order abstract logic inherent in puns, proverbs, metaphors, and analogies. Their increased facility permits them to appreciate {{the ways in which}} language can be used to convey multiple messages, such as satire, metaphor, and sarcasm. (Children younger than age nine often cannot comprehend sarcasm <b>at</b> <b>all.)</b> <b>This</b> also permits the application of advanced reasoning and logical processes to social and ideological matters such as interpersonal relationships, politics, philosophy, religion, morality, friendship, faith, fairness, and honesty.|$|E

25|$|Glass doors {{pose the}} risk of unintentional {{collision}} if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed, or is unaware there is a door <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> risk may be particularly pronounced with sliding glass doors because they often have large single panes which are hard to see. To prevent injury from glass doors, stickers or other types of warnings are sometimes placed on the glass surface {{to make it more}} visible. For instance, in the UK, Regulation 14 of the Workplace (Health and Safety Regulations) 1992 requires the marking of windows and glass doors to make them conspicuous. Australian Standards: AS1288 and AS2208 require glass doors to be made from laminated or toughened glass.|$|E
25|$|Hendrik Lorentz and George Francis FitzGerald offered {{within the}} {{framework}} of Lorentz ether theory a more elegant solution to how the motion of an absolute aether could be undetectable (length contraction), but if their equations were correct, Albert Einstein's 1905 special theory of relativity could generate the same mathematics without referring to an aether <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> led most physicists to conclude that this early modern notion of a luminiferous aether was not a useful concept. Einstein however stated that this consideration was too radical and too anticipatory and that his theory of relativity still needed the presence of a medium with certain properties.|$|E
25|$|This {{notation}} {{means that}} the corresponding Slater determinants have a clear higher weight in the configuration interaction expansion. The atomic orbital concept is therefore a key concept for visualizing the excitation process associated with a given transition. For example, one can say for a given transition that it corresponds to the excitation of an electron from an occupied orbital to a given unoccupied orbital. Nevertheless, one has {{to keep in mind}} that electrons are fermions ruled by the Pauli exclusion principle and cannot be distinguished from the other electrons in the atom. Moreover, it sometimes happens that the configuration interaction expansion converges very slowly and that one cannot speak about simple one-determinant wave function <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> is the case when electron correlation is large.|$|E
