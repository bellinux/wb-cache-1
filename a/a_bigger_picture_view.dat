40|$|According to Harvard Business Essentials (2006) an {{organisation}} is {{a series}} of decisions linked by implementation and other activities. Decisions set the pace and direction; the rest is follow through. Paul Nutt has been studying how decisions are made for more than 20 years and have found that decisions fail half of the time, without realising any benefit for the organisation (Nutt, 2002). Decision making {{is an essential part of}} the management function of an organisation. But why do so many decisions fail? Why does the outcome of decisions sometimes not satisfy the initial problem or support the organisation’s goal? Four decision making processes were analysed for this dissertation, the conclusion was drawn that current decision making processes do not incorporate a clear system approach. The dissertation shows that a system approach, as defined by systems engineering,satisfies the need for ensuring decisions are made taking into account a holistic picture. By following a system approach when making a decision, <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>picture</b> <b>view</b> can be obtained. Having <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>picture</b> <b>view,</b> will aid the decision maker in identifying whether the decision to make is indeed the right decision to be made, or merely a symptom of another decision or problem. A system approach aids the decision maker to determine where the decision to be taken fits in and what impact it will have on the system. A system approach to decision making process was designed, incorporating the strengths of the decision making process and system approach methodologies researched. The system approach methodology can be applied successfully to management decisions. By using this methodology a holistic view is obtained of a decision regarding a problem, resulting in effectively handling and managing the decision or problem.

40|$|This thesis {{was based}} on five multi-agency, urban Partnerships {{at the heart of}} the Accommodate Project: An {{initiative}} that set out to stimulate grassroots resolution to the problem of refugee housing, settlement and integration, at a time when large numbers of people were arriving seeking asylum in the UK. Refugee Community Organisations (RCOs) were engaged by the Housing Associations’ Charitable Trust (hact) to work alongside housing providers, local authority partners and others, for three years in five cities where refugees were struggling to find permanent housing. My original contribution to knowledge concerned study of the Partnerships from the perspective of organisations working with the most socially excluded, the RCOs. The Partnerships created a structure where power could be brokered. Research was conducted in a critical realist tradition in order to discover the relationship between emerging themes. Connections made between structural barriers and local interaction meant this approach presented <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>picture</b> <b>view</b> that other methodologies might have overlooked. A longitudinal methodology tracked progression from the marginalised position that was the starting point for many RCOs, struggling to survive and fill the gaps in service provision for community members. By the end of the Project, RCO partners had changed attitudes, improved access to housing services and transformed institutional relations between social housing providers and refugees. Hact’s support for RCO capacity building was fundamental to their being able to influence the agenda, define the solutions and participate in policy decision-making. The Accommodate Project created a learning space that countered marginalisation by actively involving community groups in cross-sector partnerships. This study demonstrates that community empowerment is an accumulative yet uneven process. A participatory approach allows less engaged groups to learn quickly from those that are better established. If the intention of community empowerment is to lead to fundamental change, the role of active management strategies by a catalyst such as hact is paramount. The thesis deploys and develops theories of community empowerment and network management to conceptualise the social inclusion of marginalised groups.

40|$|Bipolar {{disorder}} is a devastating illness {{that affects the}} quality of life for millions of Americans. The current diagnostic system depends on an extremely subjective interview and can frequently result in an incorrect diagnosis and ineffective treatment. An improved, biologically based, classification system requires a thorough understanding of the genetic basis of bipolar disorder. This understanding has been hampered by the difficulty in diagnosing patients and by the heterogeneity of the illness. The number of linkage analysis studies and lack of organization have also added to the challenges involved in understanding the biological basis of the disorder. The Bipolar Disorder Genetics Database web application, located at [URL] resolves the issue of organization, allowing researchers to quickly identify promising chromosomal regions that merit further investigation which will lead to understanding the functions of the affected genes and the impact of the various mutations. Understanding these functions will lead to significant advances in the areas of diagnosis and treatment. The intuitive web-based interface is a novel approach to creating <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>picture</b> <b>view</b> of our existing knowledge. The application will become the premiere resource for researchers and will assist them as they make significant advances in treating this illness...|$|R
40|$|In his {{experimental}} seminar, “Literature: Cross-Disciplinary Models of Literary Interpretation,” Alan Liu {{asked students}} to form groups around topics of their choosing and perform analyses using digital tools on their materials. Our group represented four different disciplines and therefore formed around digital tools, rather than content. Each of us took a tool in which we were to become “expert,” and applied that tool to everyone's prepared data. We found that a research focus can form around a set of digital tools even if the objects are not uniform. In this chapter, we discuss how we applied technology to our research goals and collaborative work. We address the main goals of our collaboration, as they emerged through our work together: to explore implications of using digital textual analysis methods {{on a variety of}} texts; to uncover possibilities in our datasets through experimentation with different tools; and to recognize the possibility for cross-disciplinary use of the methods we tested. We observed that the tools trend toward certain forms of interpretation and we examine how these trends affect the types of collaboration and analysis possible, but also how they can be re-purposed for alternative approaches. The most important lesson our collaborative experience taught us is that working together both pushed us and liberated us to experiment with our data and methods. In fact, much like our visualizations provide <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>picture</b> <b>view</b> of the texts we study, the multidisciplinary nature of our process forced us to step back and view our research at a macro-level. Although our collaboration began as a class project, playing together with technologies led each of us to new and significant understandings of our texts...|$|R

40|$|Many {{factors are}} {{blamed for the}} {{decreasing}} enrollments in computer science and engineering programs in the U. S., in-cluding the dot-com economic bust {{and the increase in}} the use of “off-shore ” programming labor. One major factor is also the lack of bold new vision and excitement about computer science, which thus results in a view of computer science as a field wedded to routine programming. To address this con-cern, we have focused on science fiction as a means to gener-ate excitement about Artificial Intelligence, and thus in turn in Computer Science and Engineering. In particular, since the Fall of 2006, we have used science fiction in teaching Artificial Intelligence to undergraduate students at the Uni-versity of Southern California (USC), in teaching activities ranging from an undergraduate upper division class in com-puter science to a semester-long freshman seminar for non-engineering students to micro-seminars during the welcome week. As an interdisciplinary team of scholar/instructors, our goal has been to use science fiction not only in motivating students to learn about AI, but also to use science fiction in understanding fundamental issues that arise at the intersec-tion of technology and culture, as well as to provide students with a more creative and well-rounded course that provided <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>picture</b> <b>view</b> of computer science. This paper outlines the courses taught using this theme, provides an overview of our classroom teaching techniques in using science fiction, and discusses some of the lectures in more detail as exem-plars. We conclude with feedback received, lessons learned and impact on both the computer science students and non-computer-science (and non-engineering) students. “Science fiction like Star Trek is not only good fun, but serves a serious purpose, that of expanding hu-man imagination ” Physicist Stephen Hawking (from (Krauss 1995) ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This {{case study}} is {{motivated}} by the subcontracting problem in an oilfield equipment and service company where the management needs to decide which parts to manufacture in-house when the capacity {{is not enough to}} make all required parts. Currently the company is making subcontracting decisions based on management’s experience. Design/methodology/approach: Working with the management, a decision support system (DSS) is developed to rank parts by integrating three inventory classification methods considering both quantitative factors such as cost and demand, and qualitative factors such as functionality, efficiency, and quality. The proposed integrated inventory ranking procedure will make use of three classification methods: ABC, FSN, and VED. Findings: An integration mechanism using weights is developed to rank the parts based on the total priority scores. The ranked list generated by the system helps management to identify about 50 critical parts to manufacture in-house. Originality/value: The integration of all three inventory classification techniques into a single system is a unique feature of this research. This is important as it provides <b>a</b> more inclusive, <b>big</b> <b>picture</b> <b>view</b> of the DSS for management’s use in making business decisions. </p...|$|R
40|$|The solar {{photovoltaic}} (PV) technology was an expensive niche energy source only for satellite applications, hallmarked by the Bell Lab's {{launch of the}} Telstar satellite with PV cells in 1962. Over the past decades, the accumulation of vast amount of effort across various disciplines in science, engineering, and policy has enabled the phenomenal growth of the solar PV industry into a global enterprise with about 140 gigawatt (GW) of cumulative installations {{by the end of}} 2013. Further cost reduction through innovation holds the promise in deploying terawatt (TW) -scale solar PV systems globally in both developed and developing countries, meeting growing energy demand and mitigating climate change. Chapter 1 presents <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>picture</b> <b>view</b> of the unsustainable path, heavily relying on fossil fuels, in the current global energy landscape. The main body of the dissertation examines the solar PV technology from a holistic and interdisciplinary perspective: from the basic research, to innovations in manufacturing and installing PV modules, to the driving energy policies. Chapter 2 offers a fundamental understanding of the PV technology and a review on recent scientific advances in improving PV efficiency (W/m 2). Chapter 3 reviews the state-of-the-art process flow in manufacturing commercial PV modules. In the context of pursuing further reduction in manufacturing cost ($/m 2), the thin Si film concept and its recent research effort are reviewed. Aiming to explore novel ways to produce high-quality seed crystals for thin Si film deposition, the key findings of the laser crystallization experiment is presented in Chapter 4. The fundamental thermophysics of nucleation and crystal growth is first reviewed, which highlights the importance of temperature evolution and heat transport in modelling the ultrafast laser crystallization process. Laser crystallization of a range of Si nanostructures are then carried out to study the nucleation and crystal growth behavior under some novel conditions, such as suspended narrow Si membranes and Si nanoparticles confined on top of oxide nanostructures. The cost of a PV module ($/W) is determined by both its rated efficiency (W/m 2) and its manufacturing cost ($/m 2). However, the same PV module with the same cost can lead to significantly different levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) in $/kWh, depending on the location and configuration of the installed PV system. Chapter 5 starts with an overview of the geographic distribution of solar resources and retail electricity rates, which yield a range of grid parity points across the world. Then, energy yield simulations for different PV panel tilt configurations are carried out using the angle-and-wavelength-resolved solar irradiance data, to examine the effect of angular and spectral variations in the solar spectrum on system performance. Energy policies have been the driving forces for the phenomenal progress of the PV technology: the continuing reduction in cost and the rapid growth in deployment. Chapter 6 first reviews major policy instruments for PV, and then discusses about a few important policy lessons from the rapid development of the global PV industry during 2000 - 2013. Concerned with the mounting fiscal pressure from deployment incentives and focused on further cost reductions, an innovation-focused policy framework is proposed to revive the PV manufacturing sector and to pursue an innovation-driven global PV industry moving forward...|$|R
