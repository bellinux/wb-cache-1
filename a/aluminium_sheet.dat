25|$|In 1962, the Lotus team ran the Lotus 25 {{powered by}} the new Coventry-Climax FWMV V8 engine. The car had an <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> {{monocoque}} chassis instead of the traditional spaceframe design. This {{proved to be the}} greatest technological breakthrough since the introduction of mid-engined cars, but the Lotus was unreliable at first. Jim Clark finished second that year leaving the title to Graham Hill and his new V8 powered BRM.|$|E
25|$|Alpha can {{be stopped}} quite easily {{by a few}} {{centimetres}} in air {{or a piece of}} paper and is equivalent to a helium nucleus. Beta can be cut off by an <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> just a few millimetres thick and are electrons. Gamma is the most penetrating of the three and is a massless chargeless high energy photon. Gamma radiation requires an appreciable amount of heavy metal radiation shielding (usually lead or barium-based) to reduce its intensity.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{electrons}} were {{understood to}} be charged particles of matter; the wave nature of electrons was not fully realized until {{the publication of the}} De Broglie hypothesis in 1927. The research group was unaware of this publication until 1932, when they quickly realized that the De Broglie wavelength of electrons was many orders of magnitude smaller than that for light, theoretically allowing for imaging at atomic scales. In April 1932, Ruska suggested {{the construction of a new}} electron microscope for direct imaging of specimens inserted into the microscope, rather than simple mesh grids or images of apertures. With this device successful diffraction and normal imaging of an <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> was achieved. However the magnification achievable was lower than with light microscopy. Magnifications higher than those available with a light microscope were achieved in September 1933 with images of cotton fibers quickly acquired before being damaged by the electron beam.|$|E
50|$|Two types were used: Arconic's Reynobond PE, which {{consists}} of two coil-coated <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets</b> that are fusion bonded to both sides of a polyethylene core; and Reynolux <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets.</b> Beneath these, and fixed {{to the outside of}} the walls of the flats, was Celotex RS5000 polyisocyanurate (PIR) thermal insulation. The work was carried out by Harley Facades of Crowborough, East Sussex, at a cost of £2.6 million.|$|R

40|$|AbstractElectromagnetic forming {{is a high}} {{strain rate}} forming process used for shaping metals. The {{increasing}} need for high strength-to-weight ratio in automobile bodies, stimulated automobile industries to opt for aluminium alloy which has abundant formability and high strength to weight ratio. An experimental setup to test the high speed forming of a clamped circular work piece in an electromagnetic forming system is made. The free bulging of the IS 19000 EIC annealed <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets</b> is studied. Experiments are conducted on various thicknesses of <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets</b> by varying the energy. Two different spiral coils are tried. Metallurgical studies are carried out on <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets.</b> This includes measuring the hardness of the work piece before and after deformation and a microstructure study using the Scanning Electron Microscope...|$|R
25|$|Ballistic panels, {{also called}} {{micrometeorite}} shielding, {{are incorporated into}} the station to protect pressurised sections and critical systems. The type and thickness of these panels depends on their predicted exposure to damage. The station's shields and structure have different designs on the ROS and the USOS. On the USOS, a thin <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> is held apart from the hull and causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull, thereby spreading the energy of impact. On the ROS, a carbon plastic honeycomb screen is spaced from the hull, an aluminium honeycomb screen is spaced from that, with a screen-vacuum thermal insulation covering, and glass cloth over the top. It is about 50% {{less likely to be}} punctured, and crew move to the ROS when the station is under threat. Punctures on the ROS would be contained within the panels which are 70cm square.|$|E
25|$|The Land Rover was {{designed}} to only be in production {{for two or three}} years to gain some cash flow and export orders for the Rover Company so it could restart up-market car production. Once car production restarted, however, it was greatly outsold by the off-road Land Rover, which developed into its own brand that remains successful today. Many of the defining and successful features of the Land Rover design were in fact the result of Rover's drive to simplify the tooling required for the vehicle and to use the minimum amount of rationed materials. As well as the aluminium alloy bodywork (which has been retained throughout production despite it now being more expensive than a conventional steel body due to its ideal properties of light weight and corrosion resistance) other examples include the distinctive flat body panels with only simple, constant-radius curves (originally used because they could be cut and formed by hand from <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> on a basic jig) and the sturdy box-section ladder chassis, which on Series vehicles was made up from four strips of steel welded at each side to form a box, thus cutting down on the complex welding operations required when making a more conventional U- or I-section frame.|$|E
500|$|Following a {{successful}} debut {{season with the}} 956 in 1983, Richard Lloyd commissioned designer Nigel Stroud to develop a replacement monocoque and base chassis for the team's car {{in an attempt to}} increase structural rigidity over that of the factory Porsche unit. [...] Aluminium composite honeycomb was used in place of <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> metal in constructing the new monocoque. [...] This car, originally 956 chassis #106, was replaced by the Stroud-designed chassis designated #106B, leading to the car being renamed a 956 GTi.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} project, in 2015–2016, the {{concrete}} structure received new windows and new aluminium composite rainscreen cladding, in part to improve {{the appearance of the}} building. Two types were used: Arconic's Reynobond PE, which consists of two, -coated, <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets</b> that are fusion bonded to both sides of a polyethylene core; and Reynolux <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets.</b> Beneath these, and fixed to the outside of the walls of the flats, was Celotex RS5000 PIR thermal insulation. The work was carried out by Harley Facades of Crowborough, East Sussex, at a cost of £2.6million.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of organic crosslinkers on the corrosion protection properties was investigated to achieve further {{improvements in the}} heavy metal free corrosion protection on aluminium alloys. The coating mixtures were synthesized by applying sol-gel processing to <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets</b> by spin coating. It was found that <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets</b> coated with Bisphenol A (BPA) showed very good adhesion {{before and after the}} corrosion tests. It was also found that the 2, 22 ̆ 7 -bis-(4 -hydroxyphenyl) -perfluoropropane (BPAF) possesses the highest layer resistance and the best long term stability in corrosive environments...|$|R
50|$|The chassis, {{designed}} and built by Ilario Bandini, uses {{the same type of}} material as earlier (tubular steel space-frame, <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets),</b> but the design allowed it to reach the incredible weight of only 16 kg.|$|R

2500|$|Behind {{the engine}} the {{fuselage}} was rectangular in cross-section, with four longerons and 3-ply covered. The Le Rhone rotary was partially enclosed within an open-bottomed engine cowling and was mounted on steel tube bearings. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>sheet,</b> rounded {{on the upper}} surface, covered the fuselage rearwards to the cabin. [...] There were two firewalls between engine and cabin and the carburetter, gravity-fed fuel from a tank in the central wing, {{was placed in the}} ventilated space between them.|$|E
2500|$|Land became {{increasingly}} valuable in North Kensington, {{and part of}} the plot [...] north of Grenfell Walk was allocated to the Kensington Aldridge Academy and then for a redesigned Kensington Leisure Centre. Government energy targets forced authorities to re-examine the energy efficiency of their buildings, and affordable housing targets forced them to looked for addition ways of adding accommodation to existing buildings. This, and the recurrent failure of the district heating system serving the finger blocks, resulted in 2015 in the Grenfell tower being modernised, reglazed, insulated and clad in an <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> material.|$|E
50|$|Aluminium {{composite}} panels (ACP), made {{of aluminium}} composite material (ACM), are flat panels {{consisting of two}} thin coil-coated <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets</b> bonded to a non-aluminium core.

2500|$|After the {{outbreak}} {{of war in the}} Pacific in December 1941, Airlines of Australia had found it impossible to obtain spare parts for the Lycoming R-680 engines in its two remaining Stinsons (a Stinson had crashed in February 1937 and another in March 1937). In early 1943 {{the decision was made to}} convert both aircraft to twin-engine configuration by removing the Lycoming engines and installing a [...] 9-cylinder Pratt & Whitney R-1340-AN1 Wasp engine on each wing. These engines had been imported to Australia in large numbers for use as tank engines. The noses of the two aircraft were to be re-built by installing streamlined structures made of <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|E
