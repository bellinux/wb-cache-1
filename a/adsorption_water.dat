The water content, which corresponds to the hydrogen in the soil, can regionally reach values up to about 15 %.

Therefore, water in the form of ice, must, over geological time-scales, have left in the upper martian surface (m-scale) at mid- and low-latitudes, leaving sorption water as a possible physical form of unstable subsurface water. <b>Adsorption</b> <b>water</b> is "liquid-like" at these temperatures (in the sense of a 2 D-liquid). This property is the reason for the specific importance of physioabsorbed water under martian conditions.

The KWW function has two parameters: the characteristic relaxation time and a parameter related to the dispersion of the relaxation time. Both parameters and the relaxation modulus at time 10 s, E(10), could be separated into three regions corresponding to moisture contents of 0 – 0. 05, 0. 05 – 0. 10, and greater than 0. 10.

30|$|The {{results also}} show that the {{specific}} surface area determined by <b>water</b> <b>adsorption</b> is higher than that obtained by nitrogen adsorption. Effectively, because of larger radius than water molecules, nitrogen molecules are adsorbed mainly into mesoporous spaces but do not easily enter the intra-layer spaces. This difference between nitrogen <b>adsorption</b> and <b>water</b> <b>adsorption</b> was already addressed by De Belie et al. (2010) who {{also found that the}} BET specific surface area measured by nitrogen adsorption is lower than that measured by <b>water</b> <b>adsorption.</b> According to the authors, {{it is possible that the}} nitrogen molecules can not enter the spaces between C–S–H inter-layers and therefore do not cover all of the anfractuosities in this porous domain. However, to our knowledge, there has never been a study in which these two methods (nitrogen and <b>water</b> <b>adsorptions)</b> were used simultaneously to examine microstructural changes caused by carbonation of cement materials.|$|R

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>adsorption</b> on {{carbonaceous}} materials {{has been}} studied increasingly in the recent years, {{not only because of}} its impact on many industrial processes, but also motivated by a desire to understand, at a fundamental level, the distinctive character of directional interactions between water molecules, and between water molecules and other polar groups, such as the functional groups (FGs) at the surfaces of graphene layers.

30|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to examine the}} influence of carbonation on the microstructure of cement materials. Different materials, which were CEM I mortar and paste, CEM II mortar and paste, were carbonated at 20  °C, 65  % relative humidity and 20  % of CO 2 concentration. The specific surface area and pore size distribution were determined from two methods: nitrogen <b>adsorption</b> and <b>water</b> <b>adsorption.</b> The results showed that: (1) nitrogen <b>adsorption</b> and <b>water</b> <b>adsorption</b> do not cover the same porous domains and thus, we observed conflicts in the results obtained by these two techniques; (2) the CEM II based materials seemed to be more sensible to a creation of mesoporosity after carbonation than the CEM I based materials. The results of this study also helped to explain why observations in the literature diverge greatly on the influence of carbonation on specific surface area.|$|R

It {{is important to note}} that creep occurs in sealed or immersed conditions does not necessarily mean that there is on moisture transfer and movement in material interior. It is likely the water is redistributed in various types of pores, and does not apparently exhibit any loss of moisture. The water in seepage theory is simply described as hindered <b>adsorption</b> <b>water</b> and commonly believed to be adsorbed water instead of capillary water.|$|E

40|$|Microscopic liquid {{layers of}} water can evolve via {{adsorption}} on grain and mineral surfaces at {{and in the}} soil of the surface of Mars. The upper parts of these layers will start to freeze at temperatures clearly below the freezing point of bulk water (freezing point depression). A sandwich structure with layers of ice (top), liquid water (in between) and mineral surface (bottom) can evolve. The properties of the interfacial water (of <b>adsorption</b> <b>water</b> and premelted ice) on grain surfaces are described by a sandwich-model of a layer of liquid-like <b>adsorption</b> <b>water</b> between the adsorbing mineral surface layer and an upper ice layer. It is shown that the thickness or number of mono-layers of the interfacial water (of <b>adsorption</b> <b>water</b> and premelted ice) depends on temperature and atmospheric relative humidity. The derived equations for the sandwich model fit well to a known phenomenological relation between thickness of the liquid layer and relative humidity, and can be a tool to estimate or to determine for appropriate materials Hamaker's constant for van der Waals interactions on grains and in porous media. The curvature of grain surfaces is shown to have no remarkable effects for particles in the μm-range and larger. The application of these equations to thermo-physical conditions on Mars shows that the thickness of frost-layers, which can evolve over several hours on cooling surface parts of Mars, is typically of the order or a few tenths of one millimeter or less. This is in agreement with observations. Furthermore, an equation is derived, which relates the freezing point depression for van der Waals force governed interfacial water {{to the value of}} the Hamaker constant, to the latent heat of solidification, to the mass density of water ice, and to the thickness of the liquid-like layer. Again, this equation fits well to a known phenomenological relation between freezing point depression and thickness of the liquid-like layer. The derived equation shows that the lower limiting temperature of the liquid phase can reach about 180 K under martian conditions having an atmospheric water content of around 10 pr μm. An “Equilibrium Moisture Content” (EMC) /“Equilibrium Relative Humidity” (ERH) relation for the water content of martian soil has been derived, which relates, for equilibrium conditions, soil water content and atmospheric relative humidity. This relation indicates that the content of liquid interfacial water in the upper surface of Mars can reach up to 10 % by weight and more in course of saturation during night hours, and it can be of about 2 % by weight during the dry daytime hours...|$|E

30|$|A complex {{relationship}} between all these properties could be speculated as further analysis of BSA adsorption was performed. During BSA <b>adsorption,</b> <b>water</b> was continuously being incorporated and {{trapped in the}} layer of proteins, {{as seen in the}} increasing ΔD in Fig.  3 and demonstrated by low values of shear elastic modulus (Fig.  4 d). However, the thickness and surface mass density obtained for the BSA-adsorbed layer were significantly lower than for both Fn- and Fbg-adsorbed layers. From those results when comparing with the other types of proteins tested a prevalent influence of the molecular weight (66  kDa), size, and globular-like shape of albumin is suggested. Roach et al. [51] concluded that BSA adsorbs on hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces with minimal conformational changes. Thus, the three slopes/phases obtained for BSA adsorption (Fig.  3) might be due to a process of multilayer adsorption, as once demonstrated by Höök et al.
