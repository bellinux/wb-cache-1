5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} <b>and</b> <b>reasoning.</b> Many important {{artificial intelligence}} applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E
5|$|Items {{from the}} TV series such as multi-perspective screens (as {{shown on the}} box cover) were popular for {{illustrating}} multiple viewpoints of an objective. The use of episode start and end graphics to mark the start and end of missions was also liked. The script was generally described as being a redeeming feature of the game, although fans of the series may find that the viewpoints, motives <b>and</b> <b>reasoning</b> of the villains isn't covered well. Cutscenes were singled out for particular praise by IGN, highlighting good use of camera angles and tight focus. Voice acting was generally popular, although some lines suffered from poor direction or emphasis. In contrast, device and ambiance sounds were well received with gunfire getting a particular mention.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIntegrating {{multiple}} reasoning mode {{is useful}} in complex domains like the game of Go. Go players use various forms of reasoning during a game. Reasoning at the tactical level is completely different from reasoning at the strategic level. Choosing a plan requires a different form of reasoning than knowing how to execute a plan. This paper gives examples of the integration of these reasoning modes into a single system. Rule-based <b>reasoning,</b> Constraint-based <b>reasoning</b> <b>and</b> Case-based <b>reasoning</b> are used in this hierarchical order. Constraint-based reasoning uses the results of Rule-based <b>reasoning,</b> <b>and</b> Case-based <b>reasoning</b> uses the results of Constraint-based <b>reasoning</b> <b>and</b> Rule-based <b>reasoning...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{school is}} selective; {{admission}} {{is based on}} assessments in English, mathematics <b>and</b> <b>reasoning,</b> an academic reference from the applicant's current school and an interview. The main entry point to enter the Lower School is at age 7 (Year 3), and ages 11 (Year 7), 13 (Year 9) and 16 to enter the Senior School. There are academic, music and other scholarships which reduce school fees by up to one-fifth, as well as means-tested bursaries up to the entirety of school fees. In addition, the charitable trust of the Dyers' provide a bursary to cover half the school fees of one pupil in each academic year. Cathedral choristers also receive bursaries which cover half of school fees through the Norwich Cathedral Choir Endowment Fund. The fees for the 2013/2014 academic year for the Lower School are £11,997 per annum (£3,999 per term), and £13,167 per annum (£4,389 per term) for the Senior School. The school also charges fees for lunches and entries for public examinations.|$|E
5|$|Whorf's views {{have been}} {{compared}} to those of philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and the late Ludwig Wittgenstein, both of whom considered language to have important bearing on thought <b>and</b> <b>reasoning.</b> His hypotheses have also {{been compared to}} the views of psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, whose social constructivism considers the cognitive development of children to be mediated by the social use of language. Vygotsky shared Whorf's interest in gestalt psychology, and he also read Sapir's works. Others have seen similarities between Whorf's work and the ideas of literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, who read Whorf and whose approach to textual meaning was similarly holistic and relativistic. Whorf's ideas have also been interpreted as a radical critique of positivist science.|$|E
5|$|This {{time the}} mere {{presence}} of the Theban army was not enough to cow the opposition. Since time was passing and the Mantinean alliance showed no signs of capsizing, Epaminondas decided {{that he would have to}} break the stalemate. Hearing that a large Lacedaemonian force was marching to Mantinea, and that Sparta was practically undefended, he planned an audacious night-time march on Sparta itself. However, the Spartan king Archidamus was alerted to this move by an informant, probably a Cretan runner, and Epaminondas arrived to find the city well-defended.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 508510 Although he did attack the city, he seems to have drawn off relatively quickly on discovering that he had not, after all, surprised the Spartans. Furthermore, the Lacedaemonian and Mantinean troops which had been stationed at Mantinea had marched to Sparta during the course of the day, and dissuaded Epaminondas from attacking again. Now hoping that his adversaries had left Mantinea defenseless in their haste to protect Sparta, Epaminondas counter marched his troops back to his base at Tegea, and then dispatched his cavalry to Mantinea. However, a clash outside the walls of Mantinea with Athenian cavalry foiled this strategy as well.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 510512 Realising that the time allotted for the campaign was drawing to a close, <b>and</b> <b>reasoning</b> that if he departed without defeating the enemies of Tegea, Theban influence in the Peloponnesus would be destroyed, he decided to stake everything on a pitched battle.|$|E
