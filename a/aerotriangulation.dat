After the '1 mile' military maps were discontinued in 1959, and although Defence preferred 1:50,000 maps for tactical operations, it recognised the resources needed for such a programme over large regional areas of Australia and accepted the 1:100,000 map as a practical substitute with 1:50,000 maps over specific areas of interest and military training areas. Then in 1983 Defence endorsed a program for more than 2600 scale 1:50,000 maps in Defence priority areas in north and north-west Australia, its territories and the main land communication routes. By 1996 the Corps had completed more than 1900 of these maps by - field surveys using mainly US TRANSIT and GPS satellite positioning systems and aircraft mounted laser terrain profiling, new coverage aerial photography, <b>aerotriangulation,</b> compilation and cartographic completion on computer assisted mapping systems and produced both digital and printed topographic products.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} small and/or slow reactivations of {{landslides}} requires describing their displacements over decades, {{which may be}} done with accurate multi-temporal digital terrain models (DTMs). We applied aerial stereophotogrammetry to build the historical topographies of old deep-seated landslides close to Oudenaarde in the Flemish Ardennes (West Belgium) at different dates. Three precise <b>aerotriangulations</b> (1996, 1973, 1952) were carried out. After capturing the ground data manually from the stereomodels, 2 m-resolution DTMs were interpolated by kriging, with a final accuracy ranging between similar to 45 cm and similar to 65 cm. Another DTM was interpolated with an accuracy of similar to 30 cm from airborne LIDAR data acquired in 2002. Differential DTMs were produced to identify vertical and horizontal ground displacements over the 1952 - 2002 period. We describe here the kinematics of a particularly active landslide with a well-documented recent activity. Until {{the first half of}} the 90 s, little activity of the landslide was detected. In February 1995 a reactivation event caused vertical displacements of up to - 7 m along the main scarp and up to + 4 m in the accumulation zone. Horizontal movements of 4 to 10 m are also inferred. These topographic changes correspond to reactivated slip along the rotational basal shear surface. In the same time, the main scarp retreated by up to 20 m. The reactivation, favoured by several anthropogenic factors (e. g. loading, impeded drainage), was triggered by intense rainfall. Between 1996 and 2002, the observed displacements correspond to limited scarp retreat (<= 4 m) and compaction of the slipped mass, partly enhanced by artificial drainage. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{graduation}} thesis {{evaluates the}} <b>aerotriangulation</b> methods and gives {{an example of}} a SocetSet software usage in photogrammetric data collection for aerial triangulation. Traditional <b>aerotriangulation</b> is time consuming method because it requires manual determination of tie points. On the other hand it ensures high accuracy and reliability of results. The development of image matching techniques enabled automatic approach to <b>aerotriangulation</b> where tie points are measured in automatic or semi-automatic mode. With the advent of GPS in the 80 ’s of the 20 th century, this technology was used to determine the projection centres of images. Today GNSS/INS integration in direct sensor orientation provides determination of all exterior orientation parameters without the need of ground control points. Integrated sensor orientation provides higher reliability of results, because GNSS/INS observations are only used as the additional parameters in <b>aerotriangulation.</b> This is the reason why indirect sensor orientation is still used in high accuracy demanding photogrammetric projects. SocetSet digital mapping software is used for <b>aerotriangulation</b> of large blocks of images. The graduation thesis presents the process of automatic <b>aerotriangulation</b> in SocetSet software in an practical example, where image coordinates of tie points are measured automatically. Because this software does not enable bundle block adjustment on appropriate level, we processed it with AeroSys software. This software allows us many different models of adjustment and easier detection of gross errors as well as interpretation of <b>aerotriangulation</b> accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{apparition}} {{of the first}} large format digital aerial cameras there are great expectations on their performance. The dream to get aerial images virtually free of geometric errors and with a greater radiometric quality is nearly going to be fulfilled. Nevertheless, some reports on systematic image residuals (Honkavaara et al., 2006 a and 2006 b, Alamús et al., 2005 and 2006, Cramer, 2007), unexpected height errors in <b>aerotriangulation</b> {{and the need for}} additional self-calibration parameters (Alamús et al., 2005, Cramer, 2007) have been reported since 2005. In this paper a preliminary analysis on the theoretical accuracies of the ZEISS/INTERGRAPH (Z/I) Digital Metric Camera (DMC) and analogue camera in <b>aerotriangulation</b> is carried out. This analysis considers a mathematical model where the image has conical geometry and it is free of systematic errors. It is studied the influence of the base-to-height ratio, the image pointing precision (manual and automatic), as well as, tie point density and distribution (classical Von Gruber distribution or high, dense and uniform distribution) and GPS observations for projection centre. The expected accuracy {{in the case of the}} <b>aerotriangulation</b> of analogue images using “current ” <b>aerotriangulation</b> set up (the a priori accuracy for image pointing, ground control measurement and GPS and tie point distribution) is computed. Then, a minimum <b>aerotriangulation</b> set up for the DMC camera is derived in order to warranty the same, or even better, theoretical accuracy level that is obtained in <b>aerotriangulation</b> with analogue images.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years <b>aerotriangulation</b> has been {{developing}} very fast due to influences of GPS and INS technologies on this process. The use of GPS technology in <b>aerotriangulation</b> is nowadays usual practice, often also in combination with INS. In the project of Cyclical Aerial Survey in Slovenia (CAS) GPS supported aerial triangulation has been also applied using the shift&drift method. This method has several disadvantages, e. g. the need of quite a great number of control points if no cross strips are available. In the present work the analysis of a new <b>aerotriangulation</b> method CPAS (Combined Ambiguity Phase Solution) has been made. This method enables the integration of GPS-data into adjustment simultaneously with photogrammetric measurements.

40|$|Automatic digital <b>aerotriangulation</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{essential}} processes in digital photogrammetry. Nowadays the images used in <b>aerotriangulation</b> are not filtered. The analysis of accuracy of digital <b>aerotriangulation</b> is based on the following parameters: standard deviations of alignment, RMSE of control points and check points, the quantity of properly generated tie points and the accuracy of exterior orientation parameters. A dimension of this defects is depended among other things on accuracy with which tie points have been generated. The fact that conjugated pictures created according to rules of perspective projection can differ considerably bringing in geometrical distortions on account of terrain drop, different elements of external angular orientation and lighting conditions and light reflections can distort radiometric pictures on not changed images is very essential. Therefore digital image matching of such images can have many weaknesses. In result of filtration it is possible to bring out the same terrain details on adjoining images and eliminate the noises i. e. to enhance original pictures without loss of information. The matching coefficient of filtered images will be higher than that of the original ones. Some procedures of image filtration in spectral and frequency space allow to obtain <b>aerotriangulation</b> results corrected by about 20 %. The tests for this contribution have been performed on three blocks (among others block “Echallens”) with use of Bingo-F software. Sigma naught has been obtained on the level of 3. 9 µm on block alignment. The possibility of using these filtration methods also in automatic generation of DTM it its additional advantage. 1...|$|E

40|$|Oblique aerial images {{become more}} and more {{distributed}} to fill the gap between vertical aerial images and mobile mapping systems. Different systems are on the market. For some applications, like texture mapping, precise orientation data are required. One point is the stable interior orientation, which can be achieved by stable camera systems, the other a precise exterior orientation. A sufficient exterior orientation can be achieved by a large effort in direct sensor orientation, whereas minor errors in the angles have a larger effect than in vertical imagery. The more appropriate approach is by determine the precise orientation parameters by photogrammetric methods using an adapted aerial triangulation. Due to the different points of view towards the object the traditional <b>aerotriangulation</b> matching tools fail, as they produce a bunch of blunders and require a lot of manual work to achieve a sufficient solution. In this paper some approaches are discussed and results are presented for the most promising approaches.

40|$|The UAV {{technology}} {{seems to}} be highly future-oriented due to its low costs as compared to traditional aerial images taken from classical photogrammetry aircrafts. The AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow - Department of Geoinformation, Photogrammetry and Environmental Remote Sensing focuses mainly on geometry and radiometry of recorded images. Various scientific research centres {{all over the world}} have been conducting the relevant research for years. The paper presents selected aspects of processing digital images made with the UAV technology. It provides on a practical example a comparison between a digital image taken from an airborne (classical) height, and the one made from an UAV level. In his research the author of the paper is trying to find an answer to the question: to what extent does the UAV technology diverge today from classical photogrammetry, and what are {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} both methods? The flight plan was made over the Tokarnia Village Museum (more than 0. 5 km 2) for two separate flights: the first was made by an UAV - System FT- 03 A built by FlyTech Solution Ltd. The second was made with the use of a classical photogrammetric Cesna aircraft furnished with an airborne photogrammetric camera (Ultra Cam Eagle). Both sets of photographs were taken with pixel size of about 3 cm, in order to have reliable data allowing for both systems to be compared. The project has made <b>aerotriangulation</b> independently for the two flights. The DTM was generated automatically, and the last step was the generation of an orthophoto. The geometry of images was checked under the process of <b>aerotriangulation.</b> To compare the accuracy of these two flights, control and check points were used. RMSE were calculated. The radiometry was checked by a visual method and using the author's own algorithm for feature extraction (to define edges with subpixel accuracy). After initial pre-processing of data, the images were put together, and shown side by side. Buildings and strips on the road were selected from whole data for the comparison of edges and details. The details on UAV images were not worse than those on classical photogrammetric ones. One might suppose that geometrically they also were correct. The results of <b>aerotriangulation</b> prove these facts, too. Final results from <b>aerotriangulation</b> were on the level of RMS = 1 pixel (about 3 cm). In general it can be said that photographs from UAVs are not worse than classic ones. In the author's opinion, geometric and radiometric qualities are at a similar level for this kind of area (a small village). This is a very significant result as regards mapping. It means that UAV data can be used in mapping production...|$|E

C.) in the desert region of Nasca/Palpa, about 500 km south-east of Lima, Peru. In 1998, three blocks of aerial images have been acquired during a photoflight. Two of these blocks (about 400 images, scale 1 : 7. 500) were processed using an analytical plotter Wild S 9 during 4 years of manual measurements, resulting in a high resolution DTM and 3 Dvectors of the geoglyphs as well as topographic elements (rivers, streets, houses). Especially <b>aerotriangulation</b> and DTMmeasurements have been time-consuming processes. For the third block of Nasca imagery (about 400 images at a scale of approximately 1 : 9100) we aim for an automated processing (<b>Aerotriangulation</b> and DTM generation) to provide accurate data {{as a basis for}} terrain analysis (visibility studies, surface calculation etc.) in relation to the geoglyphs (Grün et al., 2003).

We will therefore also describe the initial camera calibration performed by Vexcel and the temperature dependent model (TDM), which compensates for systematic sensor drift during OPC post-processing. Geometric properties of the image also depend on the (variable) flight conditions (e. g. radial distortion caused by refraction). Self-calibration should therefore be applied in the final bundle adjustment to achieve the highest possible accuracies. We present self-calibration parameters suitable for the UltraCamX, consisting of traditional parameter sets and parameters specially designed for the UltraCamX.

40|$|Close-range {{photogrammetry}} is an image-based technique {{which has}} often been used for the 3 D documentation of heritage objects.

However, commercially ready-to-use UAVs are often equipped with smaller sensors in order to minimize payload {{and the quality of the}} documentation is still an issue. In this research, two commercial UAVs (the Sensefly Albris and DJI Phantom 3 Professional) were setup to record the 19 th century St-Pierre-le-Jeune church in Strasbourg, France. Several software solutions (commercial and open source) were used to compare both UAVs’ images in terms of calibration, accuracy of external orientation, as well as dense matching. Results show some instability in regards to the calibration of Phantom 3, while the Albris had issues regarding its <b>aerotriangulation</b> results. Despite these shortcomings, both UAVs succeeded in producing dense point clouds of up to a few centimeters in accuracy, which is largely sufficient for the purposes of a city 3 D GIS (Geographical Information System). The acquisition of close range images using UAVs also provides greater LoD flexibility in processing. These advantages over other methods such as the TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanning) or terrestrial close range photogrammetry can be exploited in order for these techniques to complement each other...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of test flights {{performed}} with the large format digital photogrammetric camera system UltraCamX. Test flights are performed on a 5 * 7 sqkm large test site near Graz. Overall 520 images are captured in two different flying heights (GSD 10 cm and GSD 25 cm). During post-processing high resolution panchromatic and color images are processed in a fully automated workflow from the raw image data. At the same time systematic influences of the image geometry caused by temperature changes are automatically corrected. Information about the stitching process and the temperature correction are written to log files. A first analysis of the geometric quality can already be done using this information. After additional radiometric quality control an automated <b>aerotriangulation</b> (AAT) is performed for both flying heights. This is done with MatchAT (Inpho GmbH, Stuttgart) using the GPS navigation solution for the initial block setup. For each test flight in total 46 ground control points located in the test area have to be manually measured. A final bundle adjustment is done with the software BINGO (GIP, Aalen) using traditional as well as camera specific self-calibration parameters. BINGO is also used for a further analysis of the geometric quality of the UltraCamX system. This includes the visualization and numerical interpretation of certain key parameters like check point residuals, image residuals and self-calibration parameters. 1...|$|E
40|$|LH Systems new ADS 40 Airborne Digital Sensor was {{introduced}} at the XIXth ISPRS Congress in Amsterdam in July 2000. The ADS 40 {{project is a}} joint one with Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Aerospace Centre  DLR). The ADS 40 is designed to combine the geometric accuracy of photogrammetry with the spectral information required in remote sensing. The new system {{is based on the}} three-line-scanner principle, whereby panchromatic linear arrays capture high resolution views of the terrain looking forwards, nadir and backwards from the aircraft. These are comple-mented by four further arrays acquiring color and near infrared data. The performance of the carefully selected filters for these multispectral bands is optimized by a novel, spe-cially designed, telecentric lens. The ADS 40 includes a Position and Orientation System from Applanix Corporation, which uses GPS and inertial sub-systems to record the posi-tion and attitude of the sensor during flight. Data are recorded in-flight on a rugged, high capacity Mass Memory System. Extensive software has been prepared to process the raw data to enable all photogrammetric and remote sensing processes to be carried out. The processing includes an initial rectification of the raw data using data from the Position and Orientation System, followed by <b>aerotriangulation.</b> Thereafter photogram-metric and remote sensing processing continues in the normal way, except that the avail-ability of three panchromatic views is expected to increase the robustness and accuracy of image matching operations...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} scrutinizes {{the method}} of INS/DGPS integration to provide the parameters of exterior orientation needed for direct georeferencing of airborne imagery more reliably and with better accuracy. Since the well established method of INS-GPS data integration by means of Kalman filtering suppresses sensor noise over a limited frequency bandwidth only, a new filtering methodology has been developed to optimally eliminate noise over the whole motion band of interest. The proposed method includes optimal band-limiting for the inertial signal and de-noising by use of wavelets. The latter accommodates a model for short-term inertial errors, especially applicable to ring-laser gyro and fibre optic gyro technologies and presents a technique for adaptive estimation of the model parameters based solely on data analysis. In {{the second part of}} the thesis, the influence of inertial measurements on the process of GPS ambiguity determination is investigated with the purpose of optimizing INS/DGPS integration in this respect. An analytical proof demonstrating in which cases data integration by means of a centralized Kalman filter provides considerable advantages over its de-centralized counterpart is presented, and the contribution of inertial systems of different accuracy classes is evaluated. In addition, the operational aspects of airborne mapping with INS/DGPS are analyzed and strategies for minimizing the effect of hardware integration errors on the process of direct georeferencing are proposed. Lastly, the feasibility of using INS/DGPS data for the derivation of the parameters of exterior orientation is demonstrated with respect to <b>aerotriangulation</b> without ground control...|$|E
