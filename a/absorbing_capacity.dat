This paper presents an experimental study into the improvement to the damage tolerance of T-shaped stiffened carbon fibre/epoxy panels when reinforced with thin z-pins. Stiffener pull-off tests revealed that the ultimate failure load and <b>absorbed</b> energy <b>capacity</b> of the skin-to-stiffener flange connection to the panels increased rapidly with the volume content of z-pins due to suppression of bond-line cracking. Improvements to the ultimate load and <b>absorbed</b> energy <b>capacity</b> of over 75 % and 600 %, respectively, was achieved when the skin-stiffener flange connection to the panels were reinforced at the relatively modest z-pin content of 4 % by volume.

The residual mechanical properties of damaged z-pinned panels were much higher (typically {{in the range of}} 100 - 500 %) than of the unpinned panel, and based on this research z-pinning is shown to be an effective technique for increasing the damage tolerance of T-stiffened composite panels for load-bearing structural application...|$|R
