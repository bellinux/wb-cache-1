These First Party Leads were in contrast to the industry's use of 'third party leads', those contacts typically harvested from wide spectrum demographics and speculative assumption about a consumer's behavior or recent market activity. First Party Leads are generated by consumers who have already in some way been [...] "touched" [...] by a merchant or advertiser, and as a result they desire to connect with them.|$|E
50|$|Time {{synchronization}} in TSN networks can {{be achieved}} with different technologies. Theoretically, {{it is possible to}} outfit every end device and network switch with a GPS clock. However, this is costly and {{there is no guarantee that}} the Radio or GPS clock has access to the radio or satellite signal at all times - for example if the network is installed in a moving car, on a factory floor or in a tunnel deep beneath the surface of the earth. Due to these constraints, time in TSN networks is usually distributed from one central time source directly through the network itself. In most cases, this is done using the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol, which utilizes Ethernet frames to distribute time synchronization information. In addition to the universally applicable IEEE 1588 specification, the Time-Sensitive Task Group of the IEEE 802.1 committee has specified a profile of IEEE 1588, called IEEE 802.1AS-2011. The idea behind this profile is to narrow the huge list of different IEEE 1588 options down to a manageable few critical options that are applicable to Home networks or networks in <b>automotive</b> <b>car</b> or industrial automation environments.|$|E

50|$|Scheduling {{and traffic}} shaping {{allows for the}} {{coexistence}} of different traffic classes with different priorities on the same network - each with different requirements to available bandwidth and end-to-end latency. Standard bridging according to IEEE 802.1q uses eight distinct priorities with a strict priority scheme. On the protocol level, these priorities are visible in the 802.1Q VLAN Tag of a standard Ethernet frame. These priorities already allow to distinguish between more important and less important network traffic, {{but even with the}} highest of the eight priorities, no absolute guarantee for an end-to-end delivery time can be given. The reason for this are buffering effects inside the Ethernet switches. If a switch has started the transmission of an Ethernet frame on one of its ports, even the highest priority frame has to wait inside the switch buffer for this transmission to finish. With standard Ethernet switching, this non-determinism cannot be avoided. This is not an issue in environments where applications do not depend on the timely delivery of single Ethernet frames - such as office IT infrastructures. In these environments, file transfers, emails or other business applications have limited time sensitivity themselves and are usually protected by other mechanisms further up the protocol stack, such as the Transmission Control Protocol. In industrial automation and <b>automotive</b> <b>car</b> environments, however, where closed loop control or safety applications are using the Ethernet network, reliable and timely delivery is of utmost importance. For Ethernet to be used here, the strict priority scheduling of IEEE 802.1Q needs to be enhanced.|$|E
