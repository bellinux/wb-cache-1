5|$|The {{tradition}} of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent {{for much of}} the sixteenth century.

This may have reflected <b>an</b> <b>historic</b> Scottish pattern, where heraldic display, or an elaborate tomb were considered more important than a portrait.|$|E
