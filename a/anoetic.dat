5|$|Timmy, {{the late}} Jimmy's friend, asks Langly {{to attend a}} Dungeons & Dragons game in Jimmy's honor. The game, however, is a setup to inject Langly with a drug that {{effectively}} controls the subject's mind, much like Scully and Jimmy. Frohike finds an extremely flirtatious Scully at the bar with a large cluster of men around her. He takes {{her back to the}} suite where Susanne recognizes the effects of the drug, which she identifies as <b>anoetic</b> histamine. She reveals that she had not actually made the compound, except for a small batch accessible only to her and Grant, confirming his betrayal.|$|E
40|$|Based on an {{interdisciplinary}} perspective, we discuss how primary-process, <b>anoetic</b> forms of consciousness emerge into higher forms of awareness such as knowledge-based episodic knowing or noetic consciousness and self-aware forms of higher-order consciousness like autonoetic awareness. <b>Anoetic</b> consciousness {{is defined as}} the rudimentary state of raw affective, homeostatic and sensory-perceptual mental experiences. It can be considered as the autonomic flow of primary-process phenomenal experiences that reflect a fundamental form of first-person self-experience, a vastly underestimated primary form of consciousness. We argue that this <b>anoetic</b> form of consciousness constitutes an antecedent that is foundational for all forms of knowledge acquisition via learning and memory as well as higher forms of awareness or knowing consciousness. We summarize the conceptual advantages of such a multi-tiered neuroevolutionary approach to psychological issues, namely from genetically controlled primary (instinctual) and secondary (learning and memory), to higher tertiary (developmentally emergent) brainmind processes, along with suggestions about how affective experiences becomes more cognitive and object-oriented, allowing the developmental creation of more subtle higher mental processes such as episodic memory which allows the possibility of autonoetic consciousness, namely looking forward and backward at one’s life with the mind’s eye. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Although most {{aspects of}} world and self-consciousness are {{inherently}} subjective, neuroscience studies in humans and non-human animals provide correlational and causative indices of specific links between brain activity and {{representation of the}} self and the world. In this article we review neuroanatomic, neurophysiological and neuropsychological data supporting the hypothesis that different levels of self and world representation in vertebrates rely upon (i) a “basal” subcortical system that includes brainstem, hypothalamus and central thalamic nuclei and that may underpin the primary (or <b>anoetic)</b> consciousness likely present in all vertebrates; and (ii) a forebrain system that include the medial and lateral structures of the cerebral hemispheres and may sustain the most sophisticated forms of consciousness [e. g., noetic (knowledge based) and autonoetic, reflective knowledge]. We posit a mutual, bidirectional functional influence between these two major brain circuits. We conclude that basic aspects of consciousness like primary self and core self (based on <b>anoetic</b> and noetic consciousness) are present in many species of vertebrates and that, even self-consciousness (autonoetic consciousness) {{does not seem to be}} a prerogative of humans and of some non-human primates but may, to a certain extent, be present in some other mammals and bird...|$|E
40|$|Free listing is a methodological {{tool that}} {{is widely used}} in various {{scientific}} disciplines. A typical assumption {{of this approach is}} that individual lists reflect a subset of total knowledge and that the first items listed are the most culturally important. However, little is known about how cognitive processes influence free lists. In this study, we assess how recent memory of use, autonoetic and <b>anoetic</b> memory, and long-term associative memory can affect the composition and order of items in free lists and evaluate whether free lists indicate the most important items. Based on a model of local knowledge about medicinal plants and their therapeutic targets, which was collected via individual semi-structured interviews, we classify each item recorded in free lists according to the last time that the item was used by the informant (recently or long ago), the type of relevant memory (autonoetic or <b>anoetic</b> memory) and the existing associations between therapeutic targets (similar or random). We find that individuals have a tendency to recall information about medicinal plants used during the preceding year and that the recalled plants were also the most important plants during this period. However, we find no trend in the recall of plants from long-term associative memory, although this phenomenon is well established in studies on cognitive psychology. We suggest that such evidence should be considered in studies that use lists of medicinal plants because this temporal cognitive limit on the retrieval of knowledge affects data interpretation...|$|E

40|$|We have {{recently}} witnessed a confession {{of a fellow}} architect with which we fully identify. We, too, belong to the generation educated under the semiotic regime, which – as we will argue in our introduction – has run its course. We also believe {{that the idea of}} ‘architecture as language’ might have been useful as an analytical tool but never as a design mechanism. After all, creativity comes first and routinisation follows. As the title of Footprint 14 suggests, this is a general plea to have done with the hegemony of the linguistic signifier. Signifying semiotics is but a fraction of a much broader asignifying semiotics. We propose to approach the issue qua Spinozist practice of ethology, defined as the study of capacities, or – as we would like to think of it – a proto-theory of singularity. This is as much an ethical or political problem as it is an aesthetic one. It concerns what the cultural critic Steven Shaviro recently qualified as a primordial form of sentience that is non-intentional, non-correlational, and <b>anoetic.</b> The Affective Turn will be measured against the unavoidable Digital Turn. We will conclude by reversing the famous Wittgensteinian dictum whereby what we cannot speak about we must not pass over in silence. A brief summary of contributions, which are by no means limited to architecture, is concluded with a politically charged epilogue. The very last paragraph of the epilogue reveals the pink-on-pink reference...|$|E
