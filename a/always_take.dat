5|$|Verb {{morphology}} in Wagiman {{is highly}} irregular. Of the small inventory of inflecting verbs, many {{have their own}} unique tense suffixes, while other tense suffixes are common to several verbs, and while some rudimentary verb classes can be identified - stance verbs <b>always</b> <b>take</b> the past tense suffix -nginy , for instance - the tense suffixes must be learned for each individual verb.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} sessions, Lennon, Harrison and Starr {{would be}} chauffeured {{back to their}} houses in the 'stockbroker belt' of Southern England, but Aspinall would often drive McCartney and Evans in an Austin Princess limousine to a late-night club to eat. The Bag O'Nails nightclub {{was one of their}} favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. They would eat steak, chips and mushy peas, but Aspinall would <b>always</b> <b>take</b> out a torch from his pocket (in the dimly lit club) to inspect the portions on each of their plates. This was {{to make sure that the}} portions were exactly as they had ordered, which McCartney always found amusing. While Harrison, McCartney and Starr passed their driving tests, Lennon didn't pass his driving test until 1965; however, he rarely drove himself due to being a notoriously bad driver by poorly navigating roads and failing to notice other traffic, and as a result, he was usually chauffeured to and from recording sessions and appointments by his own personal chauffeur.|$|E
5|$|While Schumacher was on {{the podium}} after winning the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, Ferrari issued a press release stating that he would retire from racing {{at the end of}} the 2006 season. Schumacher {{confirmed}} his retirement. The press release stated that Schumacher would continue working for Ferrari. It was revealed on 29 October 2006 that Ferrari wanted Schumacher to act as assistant to the newly appointed CEO Jean Todt. This would involve selecting the team's future drivers. After Schumacher's announcement, leading Formula One figures such as Niki Lauda and David Coulthard hailed Schumacher as the greatest all-round racing driver in the history of Formula One. The tifosi and the Italian press, who did not <b>always</b> <b>take</b> to Schumacher's relatively cold public persona, displayed an affectionate response after he announced his retirement.|$|E

25|$|When parity {{generates the}} Abelian group ℤ2, one can <b>always</b> <b>take</b> linear {{combinations}} of quantum states {{such that they}} are either even or odd under parity (see the figure). Thus the parity of such states is ±1. The parity of a multiparticle state {{is the product of}} the parities of each state; in other words parity is a multiplicative quantum number.|$|E
25|$|Much code written {{today is}} {{intended}} to run on as many machines as possible. As a consequence, programmers and compilers don't <b>always</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the more efficient instructions provided by newer CPUs or quirks of older models. Additionally, assembly code tuned for a particular processor without using such instructions might still be suboptimal on a different processor, expecting a different tuning of the code.|$|E

25|$|In {{its report}} on the accident, {{published}} in July 2002, the Aircraft and Railway Accidents Investigation Commission called on the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) {{to make it clear}} that TCAS advisories should <b>always</b> <b>take</b> precedence over ATC instructions. A similar recommendation was made three months later by Germany's accident investigation body (the BFU) in light of the Überlingen mid-air collision. ICAO accepted these recommendations and amended its regulations in November 2003.|$|E
25|$|As mentioned, e, like di, is only {{contracted}} {{with the word}} preceding it if a phoneme is dropped from the preceding word as well. E, however, has the unique property of changing the emphasis of the word before it. Both ’e and ’i are commonly affixed to the word before them, even when they shouldn't be. In Papiamentu, ’é should <b>always</b> <b>take</b> on the acute accent because it is stressed when contracted.|$|E
25|$|Even {{if she was}} not {{the chief}} queen, Hla Wun quickly became the king's most trusted confidant and adviser. Chronicles recount several {{instances}} when she advised the king (even if he did not <b>always</b> <b>take</b> her advice). Her first key advice was to recall Yazathingyan to put down the rebellions. The king, who had just exiled the old minister, grudgingly agreed to her advice in 1258. Yazathingyan went on to put down the rebellions.|$|E

25|$|Elections <b>always</b> <b>take</b> {{place on}} a Saturday, so as to {{minimise}} the effect of work or religious commitments that could inhibit people from voting. Voting (the casting of ballots) happens at various polling stations, generally established in schools, church halls, sports clubs, or other such public places. Polling booths are also set up in hospitals and rest homes for use by patients. The 2005 election made use of 6,094 such polling stations. Voters may vote at any voting station in the country.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, March {{returned}} to civilian life but experienced bouts {{of anxiety and}} depression, a common occurrence with returning veterans. The aforementioned experience, of having bayoneted a young, blond German soldier, is recounted in Company K, there attributed to Private Manuel Burt; March suffered hysterical attacks at different moments in his life related to the throat and the eyes. He rarely spoke of his own war experiences or awards, though he was later noted to <b>always</b> <b>take</b> his medals with him and to tell war stories on occasion.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{the group}} of {{projective}} geometry in n real-valued dimensions is the symmetry group of n-dimensional real projective space (the general linear group of degree , quotiented by scalar matrices). The affine group will be the subgroup respecting (mapping to itself, not fixing pointwise) the chosen hyperplane at infinity. This subgroup has a known structure (semidirect product of the general linear group of degree n with the subgroup of translations). This description then tells us which properties are 'affine'. In Euclidean plane geometry terms, being a parallelogram is affine since affine transformations <b>always</b> <b>take</b> one parallelogram to another one. Being a circle is not affine since an affine shear will take a circle into an ellipse.|$|E

25|$|James Cook (Jack O'Connell), Freddie McClair (Luke Pasqualino) and JJ Jones (Ollie Barbieri) {{have been}} best friends since childhood. Though Cook is charismatic and sociable, {{he is also}} boisterous and not afraid of authority. His womanising drives many of {{the events in the}} series. By contrast, Freddie is an easy-going skater who likes to smoke weed, and as the more {{sensible}} and responsible friend, is often put out by Cook's behaviour. Cook and Freddie are both drawn to Effy, which drives a rift in their friendship. JJ's autism makes it difficult for him to fit in socially, but he has learnt to use magic tricks to make friends. His friends view him kindly but with a degree of amusement and sometimes irritation, but he knows Cook and Freddie will <b>always</b> <b>take</b> care of him. He is the kindest of the three, and by far the least worldly.|$|E
25|$|While pheromones {{explain the}} pharaoh ant's {{remarkable}} foraging ability, each forager’s uncanny capability {{to find its}} {{way back to the}} nest requires a different explanation. In fact, the pharaoh ant relies on geometry to show it the way home. Each fork in the trail system spreads at an angle between 50 and 60 degrees. When returning to the nest, a forager that encounters a fork will almost <b>always</b> <b>take</b> the path that deviates less from its current direction. In other words, it will never choose an acute angle that would drastically change its direction. Using this algorithm, each forager is able to find its way back to the nest. If the fork angle is experimentally increased to an angle between 60 and 120 degrees, M. pharaonis foragers were significantly less able to find their nest. This method of decision-making reduces the wasted energy that would result from traveling in the wrong direction and contributes to the pharaoh ant's efficiency in foraging.|$|E
25|$|AOL {{has faced}} {{a number of}} {{lawsuits}} over claims {{that it has been}} slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a class action lawsuit. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not <b>always</b> <b>take</b> 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.|$|E

25|$|When {{each of the}} West {{children}} {{reached the}} age of seven, they were assigned numerous daily chores to perform within their household; all were very seldom allowed to socialise outside the household perimeters unless either Fred or Rose were present, and all had to follow strict guidelines imposed by their parents, with severe punishment—almost always physical—being the penalty for not conforming to the household rules. Each lived in fear of being the recipients of violence from their parents, and although this violence was occasionally inflicted by Fred, the vast majority of this violence was inflicted by Rose for any real or imagined breach of conformity. Occasionally, the violence was irrational, indiscreet or even inflicted for Rose's simple gratification (although Rose would <b>always</b> <b>take</b> great care not to mark the children's faces or hands in these assaults). Both Heather, then her younger brother Stephen (b. 1973), are known to have run away from home, although both children returned to Cromwell Street after several weeks of alternately sleeping rough or staying with friends. Both were beaten when they returned home. Between 1972 and 1992, the West children were admitted to the Accident and Emergency department of local hospitals 31 times; the injuries were explained as accidents and never reported to social services.|$|E
500|$|More {{than merely}} passive {{resistance}} was expected—or at least hoped for—from the population. Churchill considered {{the formation of}} a Home Guard Reserve, given only an armband and basic training on the use of simple weapons such as Molotov cocktails. The reserve would only have been expected to report for duty in an invasion. Later, Churchill wrote how he envisaged the use of the sticky bomb: [...] "We had the picture in mind that devoted soldiers or civilians would run close up to the tank and even thrust the bomb upon it, though its explosion cost them their lives [...]" [...] The prime minister practised shooting, and told wife Clementine and daughter in law Pamela that he expected them each to kill one or two Germans. When Pamela protested that she {{did not know how to}} use a gun, Churchill told her to use a kitchen butcher knife as [...] "You can <b>always</b> <b>take</b> a Hun with you".
