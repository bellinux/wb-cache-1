40|$|Abstract. Certification-based {{database}} replication protocols {{are a good}} {{means for}} supporting transactions with the snapshot isolation level. Such kind of replication protocol does not demand readset propagation and allows the usage of a symmetric algorithm for terminating transactions, thus eliminating the need of a final voting phase. Recovery mechanisms especially adapted for certificationbased replication protocols have not been thoroughly studied in previous works. In this paper we propose two recovery techniques {{for this kind of}} replication protocols and analyze their performance. The first technique consists in dividing the recovery in two stages, reducing the certification load and the <b>amount</b> of information <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> in the second stage. The second technique scans and compacts the set of items to transfer, sending only the latest version of each item. We show that these techniques can be easily combined, reducing thus the recovery time. ...|$|R

Thirty-five chiefs-of-service of public hospitals in Hong Kong participated in a three-round Delphi exercise on identifying interventions that should be charged in public hospitals on the basis of questionable effectiveness and other reasons. A total of 246 interventions were identified in the first round, 126 of which received a positive score (indicating a high degree of consensus amongst the participants) {{at the end of the}} final round. The interventions that received higher scores tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> preventive services, treatment of an elective nature, and procedures for sex-related conditions.

R 600 refrigerant is chosen for HP as a most environmentally freindly and as one that has low-pressure evaporation and condensation. The economic calculation is made for interheating period with and without HP. This paper advanes selection of optimum <b>amount</b> heat <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> during low potential heat utilisation and targets for heating and cooling capacities. Almost all residential buildings connected to the district heating and that have heat module with two-stage mixing scheme HWS system have market potential.

40|$|Abstract Background The Euglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp (EHC) is {{the most}} widely used {{experimental}} procedure for the determination of insulin sensitivity, and in its usual form the patient is followed under insulinization for two hours. In the present study, sixteen subjects with BMI between 18. 5 and 63. 6 kg/m 2 were studied by long-duration (five hours) EHC. Results From the results of this series and from similar reports in the literature it is clear that, in obese subjects, glucose uptake rates continue to increase if the clamp procedure is prolonged beyond the customary 2 hours. A mathematical model of the EHC, incorporating delays, <b>was</b> fitted <b>to</b> the recorded data, and the insulin resistance behaviour of obese subjects was assessed analytically. Obese subjects had significantly less effective suppression of hepatic glucose output and higher pancreatic insulin secretion than lean subjects. Tissue insulin resistance appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> higher in the obese group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion The use of a mathematical model allows a greater <b>amount</b> of information <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> from clamp data, making it easier to understand the components of insulin resistance in obese vs. normal subjects. </p...|$|R
40|$|It {{was shown}} by Johlin and Moreland (1) that the turtle can survive under {{conditions}} of complete anoxia for 30 hours or longer, acquiring a fermentable blood sugar concentration as high as 1100 mgm. per cent and a blood lactic acid content as high as 1000 mgm. per cent. Moreland (2) showed that the histotoxic anoxia of cyanide poisoning produces almost equally high levels in the fermentable sugar and lactate content of {{the blood of the}} turtle even when the dosage <b>is</b> small enough <b>to</b> permit the animal to survive. He also showed that the glycogen of the ventricles disappears almost completely during this anoxia, while considerable stores of glycogen remain in the muscles and liver. The present paper contains the results of an investigation of the oxygen consumption of turtles poisoned by cyanide, of the effect of methylene blue upon the oxygen consumption of poisoned animals, of the effect which methylene blue has upon the restoration of the heart glycogen and of its effect upon the recovery of cyanide from the respiratory gases. It will be shown that methylene blue helps to maintain the bodily vigor of turtles poisoned by cyanide and to restore the heart glycogen, that it increase’s the oxygen consumption without immediately greatly lowering the high con-centration of glucose and lactates in the blood, and that it greatly reduces the <b>amount</b> of cyanide <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> from the respiratory gases. The data obtained apparently conform with Wendel’s (4) postulation that the action of methylene blue is that of converting hemoglobin into methemoglobin in the presence of cyanides. According to Wendel’s view the addition of both cyanide and methylene blue to blood results in the rapid conversion of hemo-globin into methemoglobin. The reduction of methemoglobin to hemoglobin, by leuco-methylene blue and the enzyme systems of the erythrocytes, which normally takes place when methylene blue alone is added, is prevented by the stabilizing action which cyanides have {{in the formation of the}} less easily reducible cyanmethemoglobin...|$|R
