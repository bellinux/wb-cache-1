50|$|On 19 July 2010, AgustaWestland {{formally}} {{announced that}} the AW169 was under development at the Farnborough International Air Show. According to AgustaWestland, the 4.5 ton AW169 is a light-intermediate twin engine rotorcraft intended {{for a range of}} utility operations; to lower prospective operational costs, a decision was made early on for the AW169 to share a large level of commonality across both components and the cockpit configuration with the larger AgustaWestland AW139. In 2011, the British Government provided a $33 million loan to AgustaWestland for the AW169 development program. In 2012, the European Union approved a 19-year €272 million zero‑interest loan from the Italian government to AgustaWestland to finance the development of the AW169; industrial research is 40% of the total, and experimental development is 60%, while the <b>aid</b> <b>element</b> is €94 million.|$|E
40|$|This article reviews recent Norwegian aid {{evaluations}} with {{a mandate}} to study impact, and assesses how the evaluators establish causal effects. The analytical challenges encountered in the seven studies reviewed are: (1) the Terms of Reference ask for evidence of impact where this {{is not possible to}} identify, (2) the distinction between impacts of the <b>aid</b> <b>element</b> versus other components is often blurred, and (3) the methodological approaches to identify impact are either poorly developed or applied superficially. A main conclusion {{is that most of the}} evaluators did not have the necessary time or budget to conduct a proper impact evaluation given the large number of questions raised in the commissioning agency. impact, evaluation, counterfactual, foreign assistance,...|$|E
40|$|The enterobacterial mobile element, R 391, is a {{prototype}} {{member of the}} SXT/R 391 family of Integrative Conjugative Elements (ICEs). SXT/R 391 -like ICEs are sitespecific genome-integrating mobile elements, frequently isolated from human pathogens. They encode a range of known adaptive traits, including multiple antibiotic resistance determinants and DNA repair mechanisms. The functionality of {{a large percentage of}} SXT/R 391 -like ICEs genes is unknown (31 % of predicted ORFs of R 391). These currently cryptic genes may encode as yet uncharacterised adaptive traits. Unusually, SXT/R 391 -like ICEs have also been found to exhibit an apparently disadvantageous recA-dependent UV-inducible cell sensitising phenotype. The identification and characterisation of the R 391 ICE gene(s) responsible for this unusual cell sensitising, cytotoxic effect was investigated. A comparative bioinformatic analysis of SXT/R 391 -like ICEs was performed, which predicted that 49 putative core genes were shared amongst all ICE members. Construction of a complete R 391 gene deletion library implicated three of these core genes, orf 90, orf 91 and orf 43, in the sensitising phenotype. Cloning of orfs 90 / 91 and orf 43, precise deletion mutant construction and RT-PCR analysis determined that orf 90, orf 91 and orf 43 are UV-inducible and that orfs 90 / 91 putatively encode a transcriptional activator complex which regulates orf 43 transcription. Functional analysis utilising recombinant expression, TEM, laser scanning confocal microscopy and site-directed mutagenesis of orf 43 which encodes a putative TraV homolog (TraVR 391), functioning as an outer membrane-associated pore-forming protein, determined that expression of orf 43 (TraVR 391) was cytotoxic to host cells by destabilising cell integrity. Results suggested that orf 43 (TraVR 391) expression alone was responsible for the cell sensitisation phenotype and that UV was a facilitator of this overexpression. A hypothesis was proposed and supporting evidence presented suggesting that orf 43 may function as a stress inducible ICE ‘trap door’ escape mechanism for SXT/R 391 - like ICEs. Hence conservation of this UV-inducible ‘cytotoxic’ gene may <b>aid</b> <b>element</b> survival and be advantageous under stress conditions...|$|E
