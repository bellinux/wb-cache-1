60|$|As {{regards the}} {{fiducial}} lines, {{they might be}} drawn on the glass screen; but black lines are not, I find, the best. It is far easier to work with illuminated lines; {{and it is important}} to be able to control their brightness. I produce these lines by means of a vertical transparency, set in an <b>adjustable</b> <b>frame,</b> connected with A, and having a gas-light behind it. Below the eye-hole e, through which I view the glass-screen g, is a thin piece of glass set at an angle of 45°, which reflects the fiducial lines and gives them the appearance of lying on the screen, the frame being so adjusted that the distance from the thin piece of glass to the transparency and to the glass-screen g is the same. I thus obtain beautiful fiducial lines, which I can vary from extreme faintness to extreme brilliancy, by turning the gas lower or higher, according to the brightness of the image of the portrait, which itself depends on the density of the transparency that I am engaged upon. This arrangement seems as good as can be. It affords a gauge of the density of the negative, and enables me to regulate the burners behind it, until the image of the portrait on g is adjusted to a standard degree of brightness.|$|E

50|$|The MPB is a Polish off-route {{anti-tank}} mine. It {{was developed}} by BELMA (BZE BELMA S.A.) with its partner Military Institute of Engineer Technology. The MPB consists of a metal cylinder filled with explosives, mounted horizontally in an <b>adjustable</b> <b>frame.</b> The mine {{is intended to be}} hidden from direct view of the intended target, {{off to the side of}} a probable vehicle route, usually a road, to attack the weaker armour on the sides and rear of a vehicle. The mine can be triggered by either a contact fuze (MPB-ZK variant) or an influence fuze (MPB-ZN variant) based on infra-red and acoustic sensors, and is also fitted with an anti-handling device. When used with the passive infrared fuze, an acoustic sensor detects approaching vehicles and activates the infra-red sensor, which triggers the mine at an optimal moment as the target passes. The mine can be programmed to self-destruct after either 1, 10 or 30 days have passed.|$|E

(The rackover device allowed the camera portion with its side-mounted viewfinder to be [...] "racked over" [...] upon its base, either {{left or right}} of the taking lens by turning {{a handle on the}} rear of the camera base. By racking to the right, the operator would focus the lens upon a ground glass element seen through the viewfinder. By racking back to the left, the camera with its film would be brought into position to record the view of the now focused lens). This standard model came with a 4-lens turret, a matte box on rails mounted {{to the front of the}} camera, and options included a veeder film footage counter, behind the lens iris, 4-way <b>adjustable</b> <b>frame</b> mattes, automatic or hand dissolve, internal matte disk with 9 pre-cut mattes including 1/2 frame, circles, keyhole, binocular, and oval. Various improvements and available options on this model took place over subsequent years, including a frames-per-second film speed meter, addition of a side-view parallax finder with upright view, various electric motors including variable speed, constant speed, and synchronized motors. The talking pictures introduced in 1926 soon required this somewhat noisy camera to run quieter with the so-called [...] "silent" [...] film movements, and soon thereafter a higher-speed [...] "silent" [...] movement and follow-focus devices were made available.|$|E

40|$|In the {{sinusoidal}} phase modulating interferometer technique, {{the high-speed}} CCD {{is necessary to}} detect the interference signals. The reason of ordinary CCD's low frame rate was analyzed, and a novel high-speed image sensing technique with <b>adjustable</b> <b>frame</b> rate based on ail ordinary CCD was proposed. And {{the principle of the}} image sensor was analyzed. When the maximum frequency and channel bandwidth were constant, a custom high-speed sensor was designed by using the ordinary CCD {{under the control of the}} special driving circuit. The frame rate of the ordinary CCD has been enhanced by controlling the number of pixels of every frame; therefore, the ordinary of CCD can be used as the high frame rate image sensor with small amount of pixels. The multi-output high-speed image sensor has the deficiencies of low accuracy, and high cost, while the high-speed image senor with small number of pixels by using this technique can overcome theses faults. The light intensity varying with time was measured by using the image sensor. The frame rate was LIP to 1600 frame per second (f/s), and the size of every frame and the frame rate were adjustable. The correlation coefficient between the measurement result and the standard values were higher than 0. 98026, and the relative error was lower than 0. 53 %. The experimental results show that this sensor is fit to the measurements of sinusoidal phase modulating interferometer technique. (c) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

A Preliminary {{analysis}} of forces {{acting on the}} head from the taekwondo turning kick Objective: To assess {{the effect of the}} TKD turning kick (RK) and its peak foot velocity (FVEL) on resultant head linear acceleration (RLA), head injury criterion (HIC 15) and peak head velocity (HVEL). Methods: Each subject (n= 12) performed five repetitions of the RK at the average standing head height for competitors in their respective Olympic weight division. A Hybrid II Crash Test Dummy (H 2 D) head was fitted with a protective TKD helmet and instrumented with a tri-axial accelerometer (PCB Piezotronics- 356 A 66) and fixed to a height <b>adjustable</b> <b>frame.</b> Acceleration data were captured using Qualisys Track Manager (Gothenburg, Sweden) and processed in accordance with SAE J 211 - 1. Results: The RK produced an RLA of 130. 11 ± 51. 67 g (range: 60. 50 – 217. 33 g) and HIC 15 of 672. 74 + 540. 89 (range: 128. 40 – 1608. 70). The mean HVEL from the RK was 4. 73 ± 1. 67 m. s- 1 (range: 3. 36 - 9. 52 m. s- 1). Height, weight, and foot velocity predicted 85. 6 % (SEE = 241. 10) of the variance in HIC 15 (p = 0. 001, f 2 = 5. 90) and of these predictors FVEL was statistically significant (p =. 019). Conclusions: The RK is of concern because it is the most common technique and most common cause of concussion in TKD and has a high RLA and HIC 15. Prevention of concussion in TKD should focus on employing qualified medical personnel, injury monitoring, and safer equipment.

40|$|Automation {{technology}} in agriculture is growing, making agricultural robotics viable. Innovative field usable multi-purpose robotic platforms {{are needed for}} the successful progression of agricultural robotics. Furthermore, the field of agricultural robotics would benefit from a robotic platform design allowing for variable height, thus accommodating navigation throughout various crop growth stages. A variable height machine, Flex-Ro was developed to accommodate this feature. Multiple sub-assemblies were designed and implemented for Flex-Ro. An electronic control unit (ECU) enabled engine was used to power Flex-Ro. An embedded application program was developed to control engine speed using proprietary Controller Area Network (CAN) messages in conjunction with J 1939 standard messages. It was observed that the maximum standard deviation from the requested set speed was 8. 423 rpm. A hydrostatic transmission system was designed and implemented on Flex-Ro. An embedded application program was developed for controlling the pumps and motors of the hydrostatic transmission utilizing proprietary CAN messages. Additionally, the embedded controller operated a Control Cut Off (CCO) that regulated flow to the spring applied motor brakes and the Electronic Displacement Control (EDC) which controls pump flow. Based on the motor speed data collected, {{it was observed that}} an increase in deviation occurred as the operational speed increased with a minimum standard deviation of 6. 98 rpm at 50 RPM and a maximum standard deviation of 36. 13 rpm at 156 RPM. The measured data should be used in developing further higher level control programs. A vertically <b>adjustable</b> <b>frame</b> was developed to allow Flex-Ro to enter crops at various growth stages. A steering system was developed and programmed to allow for steering control through the CAN bus again using proprietary CAN messages. Lastly, a remote control program was developed to allow messages to be created and wirelessly transmitted to Flex-Ro’s CAN bus for teleoperation. Sub-assemblies of Flex-Ro will be further developed for fully autonomous navigation, and performing various field operations. Advisor: Santosh Pitl...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of the latest human spaceflight objectives, a series of {{prototype}} architectures for a new launch and reentry spacesuit that would be suited to the new mission goals. Four prototype suits were evaluated to compare their performance and enable the selection of the preferred suit components and designs. A consolidated approach to testing was taken: concurrently collecting suit mobility data, seat-suit-vehicle interface clearances, and qualitative assessments of suit performance within the volume of a Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle mockup. It was necessary to maintain high fidelity in a mockup and use advanced motion-capture technologies in order to achieve the objectives of the study. These seemingly mutually exclusive goals were accommodated with the construction of an optically transparent and fully <b>adjustable</b> <b>frame</b> mockup. The construction of the mockup was such that it could be dimensionally validated rapidly with the motioncapture system. This paper describes the method used to create a space vehicle mockup compatible with use of an optical motion-capture system, the consolidated approach for evaluating spacesuits in action, and a way to use the complex data set resulting from a limited number of test subjects to generate hardware requirements for an entire population. Kinematics, hardware clearance, anthropometry (suited and unsuited), and subjective feedback data were recorded on 15 unsuited and 5 suited subjects. Unsuited subjects were selected chiefly based on their anthropometry in an attempt to find subjects who fell within predefined criteria for medium male, large male, and small female subjects. The suited subjects were selected as a subset of the unsuited medium male subjects and were tested in both unpressurized and pressurized conditions. The prototype spacesuits were each fabricated in a single size to accommodate an approximately average-sized male, so select findings from the suit testing were systematically extrapolated to the extremes of the population to anticipate likely problem areas. This extrapolation was achieved by first comparing suited subjects performance with their unsuited performance, and then applying the results to the entire range of the population. The use of a transparent space vehicle mockup enabled the collection of large amounts of data during human-in-the-loop testing. Mobility data revealed that most of the tested spacesuits had sufficient ranges of motion for the selected tasks to be performed successfully. A suited subject's inability to perform a task most often stemmed from a combination of poor field of view in a seated position, poor dexterity of the pressurized gloves, or from suit/vehicle interface issues. Seat ingress and egress testing showed that problems with anthropometric accommodation did not exclusively occur with the largest or smallest subjects, but also with specific combinations of measurements that led to narrower seat ingress/egress clearance...|$|E
