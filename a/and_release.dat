5|$|The NDL is a {{theoretical}} time obtained by calculating inert gas uptake <b>and</b> <b>release</b> in the body, using a model {{such as the}} Bühlmann decompression algorithm. Although the science of calculating these limits has been refined over the last century, {{there is still much}} that is unknown about how inert gases enter and leave the human body. In addition, every individual's body is unique and may absorb <b>and</b> <b>release</b> inert gases at different rates. For this reason, dive tables typically have a degree of safety built into their recommendations. Divers can and do suffer decompression sickness while remaining inside NDLs, though the incidence is very low.|$|E
5|$|A {{fund-raising}} experiment, Dunc-Tank, {{was created}} to solve the release cycle problem <b>and</b> <b>release</b> managers were paid to work full-time; in response, unpaid developers slowed down their work and the release was delayed. Debian 4.0 (Etch) was released in April 2007, featuring the x86-64 port and a graphical installer. Debian 5.0 (Lenny) was released in February 2009, supporting Marvell's Orion platform and netbooks such as the Asus Eee PC. The release was dedicated to Thiemo Seufer, a developer {{who died in a}} car crash.|$|E
5|$|A small {{proportion}} of follicles open <b>and</b> <b>release</b> their seed spontaneously, but most remain closed until stimulated to open by bushfire. Bushfire kills the maternal plant, which has neither thick bark nor lignotubers, but the subsequent shedding of seed allows the population to regenerate. Seed predation continues after its release: in one study, B.brownii seeds {{were placed on the}} ground in both burnt and unburnt sides; almost all were eaten by parrots within four weeks.|$|E
50|$|A followup, Slashout, {{which was}} a slash em' up set in a medieval fantasy setting, was {{developed}} <b>and</b> <b>released</b> in 2000, also for arcades.

5|$|Another {{issue is}} that Murray cod caught and {{released}} in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to spawning, resorb their eggs and do not spawn. This may be a minor issue compared {{to some of the}} other threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. At this point in time a closed season is in place for the spring spawning period, during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray cod, even on a catch <b>and</b> <b>release</b> basis.|$|E
5|$|Another story relates how Dunstan nailed a {{horseshoe}} to the Devil's foot when he {{was asked}} to re-shoe the Devil's cloven hoof.

5|$|Banksia ilicifolia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic shoots {{under its}} bark. Follicles open <b>and</b> <b>release</b> seeds after several years.

5|$|Cadmium is a soft, malleable, ductile, bluish-white {{divalent}} metal. It {{is similar}} in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds.

5|$|Carbohydrates, {{the main}} energy source in most rations, are usually fed {{in the form}} of hay, grass, and grain. Soluble {{carbohydrates}} such as starches and sugars are readily broken down to glucose in the small intestine and absorbed.
