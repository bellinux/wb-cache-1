5|$|After the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{came into}} being in 1947 as a {{civilian}} agency in control of nuclear research and weapons issues, Oppenheimer was appointed as the Chairman of its General Advisory Committee (GAC). From this position he advised {{on a number of}} nuclear-related issues, including project funding, laboratory construction and even international policy—though the GAC's advice was not always heeded. As Chairman of the GAC, Oppenheimer lobbied vigorously for international arms control and funding for basic science, and attempted to influence policy away from a heated arms race. When the government questioned whether to pursue a crash program to develop an <b>atomic</b> <b>weapon</b> based on nuclear fusion—the hydrogen bomb—Oppenheimer initially recommended against it, though he had been in favor of developing such a weapon during the Manhattan Project. He was motivated partly by ethical concerns, feeling that such a weapon could only be used strategically against civilian targets, resulting in millions of deaths. He was also motivated by practical concerns, however, as at the time there was no workable design for a hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer felt that resources would be better spent creating a large force of fission weapons. He and others were especially concerned about nuclear reactors being diverted from plutonium to tritium production. They were overridden by Truman, who announced a crash program after the Soviet Union tested their first atomic bomb in 1949. Oppenheimer and other GAC opponents of the project, especially James Conant, felt personally shunned and considered retiring from the committee. They stayed on, though their views on the hydrogen bomb were well known.|$|E
25|$|Especially {{significant}} for the war effort was Tennessee's role in the Manhattan Project, the military's top secret project to build an <b>atomic</b> <b>weapon.</b> Research and production work for the first A-bombs were conducted at the huge scientific/industrial installation at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The Oak Ridge community was entirely a creation of the war. It grew from empty woods in 1941 to a city of 70,000 (Tennessee's fifth largest) four years later.|$|E
25|$|A neutron bomb, {{technically}} {{referred to}} as an enhanced radiation weapon (ERW), {{is a type of}} tactical nuclear weapon designed specifically to release a large portion of its energy as energetic neutron radiation. This contrasts with standard thermonuclear weapons, which are designed to capture this intense neutron radiation to increase its overall explosive yield. In terms of yield, ERWs typically produce about one-tenth that of a fission-type <b>atomic</b> <b>weapon.</b> Even with their significantly lower explosive power, ERWs are still capable of much greater destruction than any conventional bomb. Meanwhile, relative to other nuclear weapons, damage is more focused on biological material than on material infrastructure (though extreme blast and heat effects are not eliminated).|$|E

25|$|The Farm Hall {{transcripts}} {{reveal that}} Heisenberg, {{along with other}} physicists interned at Farm Hall including Otto Hahn and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, were glad the Allies had won World War II, but regretted failing to create an atomic bomb. Upon hearing that the Allies had succeeded in creating atomic bombs and had dropped them in Japan, the German scientists speculated how the bomb was made and discussed their own failure. Heisenberg mentioned some misconceptions regarding {{the construction of an}} atomic bomb, such as the critical mass necessary to trigger a nuclear reaction. The morality of creating a bomb for the Nazis was also discussed. Only a few of the scientists expressed genuine horror at the prospect of nuclear weapons, and Heisenberg himself was cautious in discussing the matter. In his book Alsos, Samuel Goudsmit states that the German scientists were willing to work for the Nazis to develop an <b>atomic</b> <b>weapon,</b> and attributed their failure to scientific misconception. Paul Lawrence Rose argues in Heisenberg and the Nazi Atomic Bomb Project: a Study in German Culture that Heisenberg is intentionally misleading in his report of the atomic bomb project in order to protect his own reputation.|$|E

"Manhattan" [...] was {{the code}} {{name for the}} special {{military}} division dedicated to developing an <b>atomic</b> <b>weapon.</b> In the clandestine laboratory at the remote Los Alamos desert site, Bachelder {{was responsible for the}} analysis of the spectroscopy of uranium isotopes. Since the uranium-235 isotope is fissile, whereas the uranium-238 isotope is not, Bachelder's role in the project was a crucial task: to ensure the purity of the sub-critical material, and therefore the nuclear explosion, of the world's first atomic bombs.|$|E

Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker said [...] "I think it's dreadful of the Americans to have done it.

500|$|In August 1948, Whittaker Chambers, {{a former}} spy for the Soviets {{and a senior}} editor at Time magazine, testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). He said that an {{underground}} communist network had been working within the U.S. government since the 1930s, of which Chambers had been a member, along with Alger Hiss, until recently a senior State Department official. Although Hiss denied the allegations, he was convicted in January 1950 for perjury for denials under oath. The Soviet Union's success in exploding an <b>atomic</b> <b>weapon</b> in 1949 and the fall of the nationalist Chinese the same year led many Americans to conclude that subversion by Soviet spies was responsible, and to demand that communists be rooted out from the government and other places of influence. However, Truman did not fully share such opinions. He famously called the Hiss trial a [...] "red herring," [...] and the Justice Department was moving to indict Chambers instead of Hiss for perjury.|$|E
500|$|The first Soviet {{atomic bomb}} test in August 1949 was {{embarrassing}} to the British (who {{had not expected}} a Soviet <b>atomic</b> <b>weapon</b> until 1954) for having been beaten, but {{it was for the}} Americans another reason for cooperation. The agreement on raw materials was due to expire {{at the end of the}} year. The Americans offered to make bombs in the United States available for Britain to use if the British agreed to end their atomic bomb programme. This offer was rejected on the grounds that it was not [...] "compatible with our status as a first class power to depend on others for weapons of this supreme importance." [...] Instead, the British suggested that there would be a full exchange of atomic information, and in return for ending the production of atomic bombs in Britain, American bombs would be stored in Britain under British control. This would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952. The opposition of several key officials, including the United States Atomic Energy Commission's Lewis Strauss, and Senators Bourke B. Hickenlooper and Arthur Vandenberg, coupled with security concerns aroused by the 2 February 1950 arrest of Fuchs, who was working at Harwell, as a Soviet spy, caused the proposal to be rejected.|$|E
500|$|Gowing and Arnold {{published}} their two-volume Independence and Deterrence: Britain and Atomic Energy, 1945–52 in 1974, {{covering the}} post-war British atomic bomb programme, to which Arnold contributed six chapters. The {{success of this}} work, even before it was published, led to Gowing becoming the first occupant of a new chair {{in the history of}} science at the University of Oxford in 1972. Arnold was honoured as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1977 New Year Honours. With the concurrence of the UKAEA Board, Gowing and Arnold then turned to the task of writing the next instalment {{of the history of the}} British nuclear weapons programme, about the British hydrogen bomb programme. The work proceeded slowly, but during the 1980s, there was increased interest in the nuclear weapons tests in Australia, and the Australian government created the McClelland Royal Commission to investigate them. Having written the chapter on these for the book with Gowing, Arnold decided to produce a book. A Very Special Relationship: British <b>Atomic</b> <b>Weapon</b> Trials in Australia. It received mixed reviews, Her Majesty's Stationery Office did not market it well, and it was not available in Australia. She later produced an updated edition, Britain, Australia and the Bomb: The Nuclear Tests and Their Aftermath in 2005 with Mark Smith from the University of Southampton.|$|E
