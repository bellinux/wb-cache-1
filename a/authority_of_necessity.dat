2500|$|Ibn Taymiyyah had {{a simple}} life, {{most of which}} he {{dedicated}} to learning, writing, and teaching. He never married nor {{did he have a}} female companion, throughout his years. Al-Matroudi says that this may be why he was able to engage fully with the political affairs of his time without holding any official position such as that of a judge. An offer of an official position was made to him but he never accepted. His life was that of a religious scholar and a political activist. In his efforts he was persecuted and imprisoned on six different occasions with the total time spent inside prison coming to over six years. Other sources say that he spent over twelve years in prison. His detentions were due to certain elements of his creed and his views on some jurisprudential issues. However according to Yahya Michot, [...] "the real reasons were more trivial". Michot gives five reasons as to why Ibn Taymiyyah was imprisoned, they being: not complying with the [...] "doctrines and practices prevalent among powerful religious and Sufi establishments, an overly outspoken personality, the jealousy of his peers, the risk to public order due to this popular appeal and political intrigues." [...] Baber Johansen, a professor at the Harvard divinity school says that the reasons for Ibn Taymiyyah's incarcerations were, [...] "as a result of his conflicts with Muslim mystics, jurists, and theologians, who were able to persuade the political <b>authorities</b> <b>of</b> the <b>necessity</b> to limit Ibn Taymiyyah's range of action through political censorship and incarceration." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In the 4 th century BC, the Greek philosopher Diodoros Chronos gave a {{temporal}} definition <b>of</b> <b>necessity.</b> Because it connects modality and temporality, this definition {{is of interest}} to philosophers working within branching time or branching spacetime models. This definition <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> can be formalized and treated within a logical framework. We give {{a survey of the}} several known modal and temporal logics of abstract space-time structures based on the real numbers and the integers, considering three different accessibility relations between spatio-temporal points. 1. A Temporal Notion <b>of</b> <b>Necessity</b> <b>Of</b> the many different interpretations which can be given to the concept <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> (logical necessity, physical necessity, deontic <b>necessity,</b> etc.), one <b>of</b> the most interesting from the formal point of view is the definition <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> put forward by the Stoic logician Diodoros Chronos.
