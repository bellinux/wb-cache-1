500|$|The {{title is}} a tongue-in-cheek pun on male {{masturbation}} ("take off your pants and jack it"). Previous titles had included If You See Kay (a pun on the spelling of [...] "fuck") and Genital Ben, {{accompanied by a}} bear {{on the cover of}} the album (a reference to Gentle Ben). Stressed at being at a loss for a name, DeLonge asked guitar tech Larry Palm for suggestions. The album's title was coined by Palm, who was snowboarding on a rainy day. Inside the lodge, Palm was congregating with friends when <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>kid</b> walked in completely drenched, to which his mother suggested he [...] "take off [...] pants and jacket." [...] Palm was told by DeLonge that if the band were to use the name, he would [...] "hook him up". Instead, Palm received a letter from manager Rick DeVoe for his contribution, which offered a $500 payout for the name. Palm scoffed at the amount, and filed suit in 2003 with the intellectual property attorney Ralph Loeb, alleging breach of contract and fraud against the band. Palm demanded $20,000; the band eventually settled out of court for $10,000.|$|E
500|$|Connor again {{returns for}} Angel:After the Fall. Brian Lynch was {{initially}} confused {{about how to}} incorporate Connor into the story. It was Whedon who hit upon the arc that Connor would follow in the series. He said, [...] "Connor's <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>kid,</b> he's got powers, he doesn't {{have any of the}} bad things, he's not a vampire, so maybe he would enjoy it, and maybe he would be {{the closest thing to a}} superhero hell has". Well-adjusted now, Connor is shown [...] "fully embracing his qualities and role of a hero" [...] for the comic series. Originally Lynch had planned for Nina Ash to be more involved in his storyline, but with time it became clear to him that Connor's story is more about his relationship with Angel. So Nina fell to the wayside and Connor-Angel went on to become a much closer father-son unit. Connor also went from the character Lynch had the most trouble with to the character he enjoys writing most. Regarding Connor's upcoming role in Angel & Faith, Whedon joked about time-traveling him to the early 1960s and making him an ad executive, referencing Kartheiser 's recent role in the critically acclaimed television series Mad Men. Author Christos Gage describes the necessity of Connor's appearance with [...] "otherwise Angel is just a deadbeat Dad!" ...|$|E

By this point, the Yankees, long noted for being slow to adapt to changes in race relations, have come to develop many minority players in their farm system and seek out others via trades and free agency. Jackson usually appears in uniform at the Yankee's spring training complex in Tampa, Florida, and was sought out for advice by such recent stars as Derek Jeter, before his retirement, and by former Yankee star Alex Rodriguez. [...] "His experience is vast, and he's especially good with the young players in our minor league system, the 17- and 18-year old kids. They respect him and what he's accomplished in his career.
