25|$|Weather {{conditions}} during 1350-1600 CE {{were better}} suited for maize growing on the upper Ohio Valley and West Virginia's tributary valleys. In the same time frame, the central and southwest Ohio (Till Plains) had cooler and wetter conditions, which affected the 'silking', pollination and grain filling stages that likely caused lower yields. Corn consumption decreased in the middle Ohio valley. The following weather pattern had intermittent droughts. This research also includes isotope <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> from 47 archaeological sites in West and South Ohio, and western West Virginia (Staller, Tykot and Benz 2006:219,220).

25|$|Trans fats {{are used}} in {{shortenings}} for deep-frying in restaurants, {{as they can be}} used for longer than most conventional oils before becoming rancid. In the early 21st century, non-hydrogenated vegetable oils that have lifespans exceeding that of the frying shortenings became available. As fast-food chains routinely use different fats in different locations, trans fat levels in fast food can have large variations. For example, an <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> of McDonald's French fries collected in 2004 and 2005 found that fries served in New York City contained twice as much trans fat as in Hungary, and 28 times as much as in Denmark, where trans fats are restricted.

Even within the United States there was variation, with fries in New York containing 30% more trans fat than those from Atlanta.|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} {{geologic}} deposits on {{the valley floor}} originating from several different events in the geologic timeline of the Moon. One of these formations, the light mantle, is a deposit of lightly colored material {{in a series of}} projections extending about sixkilometres (3.7mi) from the south massif across the floor. Pre-mission analyses suggested that this deposit might be the result of an avalanche originating from the northern slope of the south massif. Post-mission <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> of the material show that it is primarily composed of fine-grained material and scattered rock fragments that were presumably spread across the valley floor from the south massif at some point. Evidence from samples and visual observations taken during Apollo 17 show that the light mantle varies in thickness throughout the valley. Craters located farther away from the south massif penetrate through the light mantle to darker underlying material. Meanwhile, craters close to the south massif as wide as [...] do not appear to penetrate to darker material at all.
