5|$|Bolckow, Vaughan & Co., Ltd was an English {{ironmaking}} {{and mining}} company founded in 1864, {{based on the}} partnership since 1840 of its two founders, Henry Bolckow and John Vaughan.

5|$|Conductive CVD diamond is {{a useful}} {{electrode}} under many circumstances. Photochemical methods {{have been developed for}} covalently linking DNA to the surface of polycrystalline diamond films produced through CVD. Such DNA modified films can be used for detecting various biomolecules, which would interact with DNA thereby changing electrical conductivity of the diamond film. In addition, diamonds can be used to detect redox reactions that cannot ordinarily be studied and in some cases degrade redox-reactive organic contaminants in water supplies. Because diamond is mechanically and chemically stable, it can be used as an electrode under conditions that would destroy traditional materials. As an electrode, synthetic diamond can be used in waste water treatment of organic effluents <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> strong oxidants.|$|E
5|$|Doro Pesch {{was cast}} as the warrior Meha in the prehistoric action movie Anuk-Der Weg des Kriegers (Anuk-The Way of the Warrior), written, {{directed}} and interpreted by Luke Gasser and shot in Switzerland in 2005. The film was released in 2006 and features also Marc Storace, lead singer of the Swiss hard rock band Krokus. During the period of shooting, she wrote and recorded new songs in Switzerland with local session musicians <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> Gasser, who used three of those songs for the soundtrack of the movie. More songs were recorded in Germany in the spare time between tours with her band and usual collaborators, and released in 2006 in the album Warrior Soul.

5|$|DuPont {{commenced}} {{construction of}} the plutonium semiworks at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge on February 2, 1943. The reactor went critical on November 4, 1943, and produced its first plutonium in early 1944. It supplied the Los Alamos Laboratory with its first significant amounts of plutonium, and its first reactor-bred product. Studies of these samples heavily influenced bomb design. The reactor and chemical separation plant provided invaluable experience for engineers, technicians, reactor operators, and safety officials who {{then moved on to}} the Hanford site. It operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> radioactive isotopes for scientific, medical, industrial and agricultural uses. It was shut down in 1963, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965.|$|E
5|$|During {{the concert}} tour, Linkin Park and Thirty Seconds to Mars {{promoted}} greener touring practices {{and worked with}} Music for Relief, a non-profit organization to support disaster relief and programs to protect the environment. The Carnivores Tour received general critical acclaim, with critics praising both artists' performance abilities <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> the show. The concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California, was filmed and streamed live over the interactive social platform VyRT.|$|E
5|$|From about 1790 {{textiles}} {{became the}} most important industry in the west of Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving of cotton, which flourished until in 1861 the American Civil War cut off the supplies of raw cotton. The industry never recovered, {{but by that time}} Scotland had developed heavy industries based on its coal and iron resources. The invention of the hot blast for smelting iron (1828) revolutionised the Scottish iron industry. As a result, Scotland became a centre for engineering, shipbuilding <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> locomotives. Toward the end of the 19th century, steel production largely replaced iron production.|$|E

In 1879, the total area devoted to rice was 174,173 acres, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> total <b>production</b> <b>of</b> clean rice was up again to 110,131,373 pounds. A decade later, the total area devoted to rice cultivation was 161,312 acres, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> total <b>production</b> <b>of</b> clean rice equaled 128,590,934 pounds; this represented a 16.76 {{percent increase in}} the amount produced, with a decrease of 7.38 percent in the area under cultivation.|$|R
5|$|In ascomycetes, dikaryotic hyphae of the {{hymenium}} (the spore-bearing tissue layer) form {{a characteristic}} hook at the hyphal septum. During cell division, {{formation of the}} hook ensures proper distribution of the newly divided nuclei into the apical and basal hyphal compartments. An ascus (plural asci) is then formed, in which karyogamy (nuclear fusion) occurs. Asci are embedded in an ascocarp, or fruiting body. Karyogamy in the asci is followed immediately by meiosis <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> ascospores. After dispersal, the ascospores may germinate and form a new haploid mycelium.|$|E
5|$|Potassium is an {{extremely}} active metal that reacts violently with oxygen in water and air. With oxygen it forms potassium peroxide, and with water potassium forms potassium hydroxide. The reaction of potassium with water is dangerous because of its violent exothermic character <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen gas. Hydrogen reacts again with atmospheric oxygen, producing water, which reacts with the remaining potassium. This reaction requires only traces of water; because of this, potassium and the liquid sodium-potassium — NaK — are potent desiccants {{that can be used}} to dry solvents prior to distillation.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s were a {{formative}} decade: {{the increased}} optimism after {{the signing of}} the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, the economic recovery of the mid-1980s and the increasing travel abroad by average citizens were factors contributing to a greater interest in food and wine. In addition, high quality, locally produced ingredients became increasingly available. For example, privately owned dairies began to produce handmade cheeses from goat, sheep and cow’s milk, which quickly became very popular both among chefs and the general public. In 1983, the Golan Heights Winery was the first of many new Israeli winemakers to help transform tastes with their production of world-class, semi-dry and dry wines. New attention was paid to the making of handmade breads <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> high quality olive oil. The successful development of aquaculture ensured a steady supply of fresh fish, and the agricultural revolution in Israel led to an overwhelming choice and quality of fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs.|$|E

A {{recording of the}} Up All Night Tour was filmed during One Direction's January 2012 show at the International Centre in Bournemouth. Documenting the whole concert with intersperses of backstage footage, a video album, , was released on DVD in May 2012. The video concert DVD was a global success, topping the charts in twenty-five countries and setting an unprecedented US chart record. By August 2012, the video album had sold in excess of one million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{popularity of}} the Internet in the late 1990s/early 2000s helped NWOBHM fans and musicians to reconnect and rekindle their shared enthusiasm. The NWOBHM experienced a minor revival, highlighted by the good sales of old vinyl and collectibles and by the demand for new performances. Statements of appreciation by metal bands of the 1990s, the success of tribute bands, the re-issues of old albums <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> new thoroughly edited compilations, attracted the media's attention and encouraged many of the original groups to reunite for festival appearances and tours. According to Macmillan and AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia, {{probably the most important}} of those compilation albums was New Wave of British Heavy Metal '79 Revisited, compiled by Metallica's drummer Lars Ulrich and former Sounds and Kerrang! journalist Geoff Barton. It was released in 1990 as a double CD, featuring bands as obscure as Hollow Ground right through to the major acts of the era.|$|E
