Prospective cohort. This study was nested within a cluster-randomized crossover study of selective digestive decontamination and selective oropharyngeal decontamination in 16 ICUs in The Netherlands.

Antibiotic resistance <b>acquisition</b> <b>rates</b> were defined as the number of conversions from susceptible to resistant for a specific antibiotic per 100 patient-days or 100 days of antibiotic exposure within an individual patient. The hazard of antibiotic use for resistance development in P. aeruginosa was based on time-dependent Cox regression analysis. Findings of this study cohort were compared with those of a previous cohort of patients not receiving selective digestive decontamination/selective oropharyngeal decontamination. Numbers of eligible patients were 277 for P. aeruginosa, 174 for Klebsiella species, and 106 for Enterobacter species. Resistance <b>acquisition</b> <b>rates</b> per 100 patient-days ranged from 0. 2 (for colistin and ceftazidime in P. aeruginosa and for carbapenems in Klebsiella species) to 3. 0 (for piperacillin-tazobactam in P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter species).

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{is used to}} examine the effects of host population demography and transmission behavior on the evolution of virulence of a sexually transmitted pathogen such as HIV. The effect of the rate at which hosts acquire new partners is shown to depend critically on the details of the host population’s growth pattern, sexual contact rate, and level of infection. At density-limited equilibrium, new partner <b>acquisition</b> <b>rates</b> have no effect on virulence. In an exponentially growing host population, higher partner <b>acquisition</b> <b>rates</b> favor the less virulent strain, as do lower rates of host population growth.

We quantified effects of selective decontamination on acquisition of colistin-resistant gram-negative bacteria (GNB) using data from a cluster-randomized study and a single-centre cohort. Acquisition of colistin-resistant GNB and conversion from susceptible to resistance in GNB was determined in respiratory samples [from patients receiving SDD (n = 455), SOD (n = 476), or standard care (SC) (n = 315) ], and in rectal swabs from 1, 840 SDD-patients. Genotyping of converting isolates was performed where possible.

50|$|Another {{consideration}} of group cooperation is {{as a way}} to increase food yields in comparison to acquiring food individually; this can be considered a form of mutualism. Bruce Winterhalder incorporates food-sharing among groups into the diet breadth model derived from optimal foraging theory as a means to reduce risk. Risk is measured in this model as a measure of the probability that a forager's net <b>acquisition</b> <b>rate</b> (NAR) falls below a minimum value, such as a threshold for starvation. Through the use of a stochastic model, a group of independent foragers are able to meet and pool their resources {{at the end of a}} foraging period and divide the total resources equally among the group. Through a series of simulations exploring values of group size and other parameters of the model, the results suggest that risk is effectively reduced by pooling and dividing equal shares of resources. When compared with changes in diet breadth, sharing seems to be better at reducing risk than changing the diet breadth. Examination of various group sizes suggests that small groups are capable of effectively reducing risk.|$|E
50|$|So {{little is}} known about the {{southern}} marsupial mole that it is difficult to assess its exact distribution and how it varied over the last decades. However circumstantial evidence suggests that their numbers are dwindling. Although the decreasing <b>acquisition</b> <b>rate</b> is difficult to interpret due to the chance nature of the findings, there are reasons for concern. About 90% of medium-sized marsupials in arid Australia have become threatened due to cat and fox predation. A recent study indicates that remains of marsupial moles have been found in 5% of the cats and foxes faecal pellets examined. Moles are also sensitive to changes in the availability of their food caused by changing fire regimes and the impact of herbivores. The southern marsupial mole is currently listed as endangered by the IUCN. Efforts to protect this unique species focus on advocating for maintaining a healthy population of moles to better understand their biology and behavior, and for conducting field studies to monitor the species distribution and abundance with the help of Aborigines.|$|E

Perhaps more importantly, the development of ICOS based techniques have now been demonstrated over the range from the near UV to the mid-infrared. In addition, the frequency-agile rapid scanning (FARS) CRDS technique has been developed to overcome the mechanical or thermal frequency tuning which typically limits CRDS <b>acquisition</b> <b>rates.</b> The FARS method utilizes an electro-optic modulator to step a probe laser side band to successive cavity modes, eliminating tuning time between data points and allowing for <b>acquisition</b> <b>rates</b> about 2 orders of magnitude faster than traditional thermal tuning.|$|R
40|$|Children {{diagnosed}} with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) {{who fail to}} develop functional speech are candidates for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems. One of the primary intentions of AAC is to provide an alternative method of communicating {{in the absence of}} speech (Mirenda, 2003). In order to select the most beneficial AAC system for a user, in regards to the ease of acquisition and successfully communicating with AAC systems, it is considered important to undertake research comparing various AAC systems and to assess users’ preferences for using one system over another. Empirical evidence from previous studies comparing AAC indicates that users often learn to use AAC systems with varying degrees of proficiency and at various <b>acquisition</b> <b>rates.</b> Additionally, assessing users’ preferences for different AAC systems has been shown to influence <b>acquisition</b> <b>rates</b> and long term maintenance of AAC systems and is suggested to be an important component when carrying out AAC intervention. In the present study a tangible symbol (TS) communication system was compared, in terms of <b>acquisition</b> <b>rates</b> and preference, with Picture Exchange (PE) and an additional direct selection (DS) method of gaining access to desired stimuli in two young boys with ASD. Two male participants {{diagnosed with}} ASD were taught via systematic instructional procedures to request/gain access to the continuation of preferred cartoon movies by using TS, PE, and DS. Additionally, preference assessments were implemented during intervention and follow-up phases to determine whether the participants showed a preference for using one of these three requesting/access methods over the other two, and whether any such preferences remained stable throughout follow-up sessions. Results indicated that both participants successfully learned to request each of the six cartoon movies using each of the three methods. Specifically, <b>acquisition</b> <b>rates</b> for TS and PE were comparable across both participants, and overall both participants preferred to request using the TS. During intervention sessions, one participant preferred to use DS, however this preference changed during follow-up where he chose to use TS more overall.
