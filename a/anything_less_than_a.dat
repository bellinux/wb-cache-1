With this in mind, a draw for Scotland would be sufficient to virtually guarantee second place in Group 7 and advance at the very least through to the two legged play-off against the winner of the Oceania qualifying tournament, while a win would likely see them top the group and qualify automatically. For Wales, <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> win would virtually end their hopes of qualification.|$|E

First-year head coach Chris Petersen led this perennially strong non-BCS conference school to an undefeated 12–0 record.

25|$|Branyan {{rejected}} a one-year {{offer from the}} Mariners on November 10. He stated {{that the reason for}} the decline was because he wanted a contract that lasted for more than one year, possibly a two or three-year contract. Branyan also stated that he still wanted to return to Seattle, but would rather test the free agent market than settle for <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> two-year contract. On January 7, 2010, the Seattle Mariners traded infielder Bill Hall for first baseman Casey Kotchman. For Branyan, this meant it was unlikely the Mariners would offer him a new contract as Kotchman would be the likely candidate for the starting job at first base, vacated by Branyan. On February 2, 2010, ESPN.com reported that the Florida Marlins had offered a one-year contract to Branyan. On February 5, a conflicting report stated that the Marlins had not offered Branyan a contract. On February 9, Foxsports.com reported that Branyan has drawn interest from both the Cleveland Indians, and the Toronto Blue Jays. Joe Frisaro, writer for MLB.com, reported on February 13, that the Marlins were not interested in signing Branyan. It was reported by Foxsports.com on February 16, that the Tampa Bay Rays, the Boston Red Sox, and the Cleveland Indians were interested in signing Branyan. That day, the Indians offered Branyan a one-year major league contract, according to MLB.com. On February 17, it was reported by Foxsports.com that the Red Sox were no longer interested in Branyan.|$|E

25|$|The months {{following}} {{the acceptance of the}} Treaty saw a gradual progression to civil war. The split in Sinn Féin gradually deepened and the majority of the IRA hardened against accepting <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> full republic. Collins and de Valera tried desperately to find a middle course and formed a pact whereby Sinn Féin fought a General Election in June with a common slate of candidates. Despite this pact, the electorate voted heavily in favour of pro-Treaty candidates. On the day of the election, the draft Free State Constitution was published and rejected by the Anti-Treatyites as it was clearly not a republican document. Collins, forced to a decision, opted to maintain the Treaty position and the support of the British Government, and moved to suppress the Republican opposition that had seized the Four Courts in Dublin. The Civil War started on 28 June 1922, and the IRA was decisively defeated in the field over the following two months, being largely pinned back to Munster. In August 1922, both Griffith and Collins died in quick succession; the former of natural causes, the latter a few days later when ambushed by Republicans at Béal na Bláth. With de Valera now on the fringes as the nominal leader of the Anti-Treaty forces in the Civil War, the new dominion (which {{was in the process of}} being created but which would not legally come into being until December 1922) had lost all its most senior figures.|$|E

However, at 15:35 British General Headquarters (GHQ) ordered him to exploit the situation and use any opportunity to attack. Birdwood replied that <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> general assault would be futile. In the northern sector Major-General Alexander Godley, commanding the New Zealand and Australian Division, decided to attack. The Wellington Mounted Rifles was ordered to attack the Turkish trenches at The Nek. The trench that was their first objective was [...] across no man's land with no cover at all. The regiment prepared to obey the order, but arranged the attack so that no single squadron would be wiped out. The men were selected in equal proportion from all three squadrons, and Captain William Hardham VC was chosen to command them. [...] Brigadier-General Andrew Russell, commanding the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, contacted Godley to advise him of the circumstances of such an attack, and Russell was told to [...] "use his own judgement" [...] so promptly called it off. The Turks kept up their artillery bombardment on the beachhead {{for the remainder of the}} day. That, along with a prisoner disclosing that another attack was imminent, persuaded GHQ to recall the New Zealand Infantry Brigade from Cape Helles to Anzac Cove that night.|$|E

Other films in recent years had been cited as contenders for surpassing Titanic, such as 2008's The Dark Knight, but Avatar was considered the first film with a genuine chance to do so, and its numbers being aided by higher ticket prices for 3D screenings did not fully explain its success to box office analysts.

[...] Analysts predicted second place for the film's worldwide gross, but most were uncertain about it surpassing Titanic because [...] "Today's films flame out much faster than they did when Titanic was released." [...] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, believed in the film's chances of becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, though he also believed it was too early to surmise because it had only played during the holidays. He said, [...] "While Avatar may beat Titanics record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s." [...] Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to [...] "try to topple Titanic off its perch" [...] because it [...] "just struck some kind of chord" [...] and there had been other good films in recent years.

With the {{reference}} to trinitarian theology {{it appears to have}} learned from Barth that the doctrine of the Trinity is no mere dogmatic addendum, merely another thing confessed.

Worries about whether Barth has truly engaged with the pluriformity, or the very trinitarianness, of God in his account of the Trinity could understand the "after Barth" as a way of returning threefold difference to theology over against Barth's perceived indulgence in singularising divine subjectivity.
