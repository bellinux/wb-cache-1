50|$|Verreaux's eagle-owl takes {{a diverse}} range of birds as prey. More than 50 avian prey species have been {{identified}} and they may locally exceed mammals in importance in the diet, somewhat unusually for eagle-owls. No one type of bird {{can be said to}} be predictably favored as prey and any avian species unfortunate enough to have a nighttime roost or nest that happens to be in an eagle-owl's foraging path may fall victim to this species. Many cases of predation involve nest robbery, with nestlings or fledglings being taken, although adult birds may be taken just as often, especially for species with less conspicuous nests. In South Africa's De Hoop Nature Reserve, it was found that birds were somewhat better represented by both number, 43.3% of remains, and biomass, 57.84% of remains, than mammals or any other prey group. The species best represented in biomass in the prior study was the black-headed heron (Ardea melanocephala) with several adults estimated to average 1260 g being found among the prey remains. Other fairly common, largish herons are also known to fall prey at night to Verreaux's eagle-owl including the 873 g great egret (Ardea alba), the 1443 g grey heron (Ardea cinerea) and the 975 g purple heron (<b>Ardea</b> <b>purpurea).</b> Other medium-sized water birds known to have been represented in this species diet include the 1008 g yellow-billed duck (Anas undulata), the 983 g African black duck (Anas sparsa), the 596 g African swamphen (Porphyrio madagascariensis) and the 825 g red-knobbed coot (Fulica cristata). Besides herons, another well-represented group of birds in the diet are galliforms. Perhaps the most widely prey species reported from this group is the 1229 g helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris), which may seasonally dominate the eagle-owl's food in Kenya. More modestly sized wild galliform species reported in the diet including the 96 g common quail (Coturnix coturnix) and the 390 g grey-winged francolin (Francolinus africanus). Domestic fowl, especially those allowed back to a semi-feral state and thus sleeping in the open as is prevalent in Africa, are taken when encountered, including chickens and peafowls.|$|E

Ciconiphilus decimphastiatus has been described parasitizing Ardeid species in the Iberian peninsula but not in the Balearic Islands.

In addition to the census along the streams, the main Herons’ roosting site in the Polcevera Valley has been monitored from December 2007 to May 2008. The data collected by this last method resulted useful since they have proved the effectiveness of the census along the streams for the Little Egret and the Great White Egret and they allow to assess the real abundance of the Cattle Egret, which can’t be correctly counted by means of the census along the streams, because of the eco-ethology of this species...|$|E

For this purpose we tried to check some of the wild bird species available and mostly not checked before to identify the lice of them. The birds were found in some of the houses of hunters keeping as trap for catching more birds, some of the bird keepers and a few dead birds from taxidermists. In this way we could check 79 birds of 6 species. We identified 11 lice species on the birds and overall 15. 2 % of the examined birds were infested by the lice.

Methods: Collection of regurgitates from purple heron chicks (n = 52) and night heron chicks (n = 12) during ringing operations in 2001 - 2002. Collection of pellets (n = 80) under daytime roosts of night herons in 2001 - 2002.

40|$|International audienceReedbeds of Phragmites australis have {{declined}} in Europe in recent decades. Moreover, in some European countries the remaining reedbeds are intensively managed for industrial reed cutting, hunting or grazing. Several species of conservation concern, such as herons and pelicans, use reedbeds as their principal breeding habitat. At the same time, data on habitat use and colony size {{of these species}} in relation to reedbed management practices are scarce. We investigated habitat characteristics of 71 reedbeds occupied or unoccupied by breeding Purple Herons <b>Ardea</b> <b>purpurea</b> in the Rhône delta (Camargue) and in other Mediterranean coastal marshes in southern France. In addition, data on colony size in occupied reedbeds were collected from aerial surveys. Reedbeds occupied by breeding Purple Herons were unharvested, or only partially harvested, in winter and had higher water levels in spring compared with unoccupied reedbeds. A logistic regression model with reed harvesting intensity and water levels in mid-April as independent variables correctly classified reedbed use for 94. 7 % of the reedbeds in the study. A model with water levels in mid-April alone was only 90. 9 % accurate, suggesting that low water level in spring {{is the most important}} factor limiting reedbed occupation by breeding Purple Herons. A general linear model indicated significant effects of harvesting intensity and reedbed surface area on colony size. Within occupied reedbeds there was a strong tendency for colony size to increase with increasing reedbed surface area. Given the recent developments in reed harvesting and wetland management in southern France and elsewhere in Europe, these results provide the first information on potential effects of these practices on reed nesting herons, and suggest that Purple Heron conservation is likely to be favoured by maintaining large uncut reedbeds with relatively high water levels in spring. The possible effect of changes in habitat on the Purple Heron population in southern France is discussed...|$|E

Odonata nymphs were present in 13. 5 % of samples and aquatic Coleoptera in 9. 6 %. Regurgitates from night heron chicks were also dominated by carp, recorded in 83. 3 % of the samples and representing 76. 3 % of prey items. Coleoptera larvae were present in 25 % of samples. There was no difference in the size of carp consumed by the two species, but carp taken by purple heron were larger in 2002. Night heron pellets collected outside the breeding colonies lacked fish and were dominated by red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii, present in 86. 2 % of pellets and representing 44. 4 % of prey items. Terrestrial insects were also abundant in pellets. Conclusions: In spite of the great increase in abundance of P. clarkii in natural marshes since earlier studies in 1977 - 1983, and other major changes in the ecosystem, there has been no detectable change in purple heron diet over this period. Night heron and purple heron chicks in Donana fed prodominantly on an invasive fish. Outside the breeding colonies, night herons fed predominantly on an invasive crayfish. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
