By August, casualty clearing stations or clearing hospitals were located at Ludd, Jaffa <b>and</b> <b>Jerusalem,</b> supported by medical stores depots at Ludd <b>and</b> <b>Jerusalem.</b> However, the Australian Stationary Hospital at Moascar only had a few beds available.

5|$|Assaf Tarabay was not {{reinstated}} as governor, but Lajjun {{remained in}} Tarabay hands, {{under the rule}} of Governor Tarabay ibn Ali who was succeeded upon his death by his son Ahmad in 1601, who also ruled until his death in 1657. Ahmad, known for his courage and hospitality, helped the Ottomans defeat the rebel Janbulad and gave shelter to Yusuf Sayfa — Janbulad's principal rival. Ahmad, in coordination with the governors of Gaza (the Ridwan family) <b>and</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> (the Farrukh family), also fought against Fakhr ad-Din II in a prolonged series of battles, which ended with the victory of the Tarabay-Ridwan-Farrukh alliance after their forces routed Fakhr ad-Din's army at the al-Auja river in central Palestine in 1623.|$|E
5|$|Between 1994 and 2009, {{the city}} had a declining and aging {{population}} compared to Tel Aviv <b>and</b> <b>Jerusalem,</b> as young people moved {{to the center of}} the country for education and jobs, while young families migrated to bedroom communities in the suburbs. However, as a result of new projects and improving infrastructure, the city managed to reverse its population decline, reducing emigration while attracting more internal migration into the city. In 2009, positive net immigration into the city was shown for the first time in 15 years.|$|E
5|$|Hasan Pasha's {{nickname}} Arap ("Bedouin") {{derived from}} the Ridwan family's good relations with and reputation for keeping the Bedouin tribes in check. When Hasan was commissioned by Sultan Murad IV to help suppress the long-running rebellion of Fakhr ad-Din II (1623-1635), Hasan's Bedouin units often proved effective in battle. During this period, Hasan Pasha gained the additional governorship of Tripoli, although he was deposed in 1644. His rule impoverished Gaza Sanjak and burdened the Ridwan family with heavy debts. According to the Damascene historian and Hasan's contemporary, Muhammad Amin al-Muhibbi, Hasan Pasha had numerous wives and concubines and fathered 85 children. During Hasan Pasha's lifetime, one of his sons, Husayn Pasha, served as governor of Nablus <b>and</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> as well as amir al-hajj.|$|E

5|$|In 1203, Renoart of Nephin, Bohemond's vassal, married Isabel the heiress of Gibelcar, {{without his}} authorization. The High Court of Tripoli ordered the {{confiscation}} of Renoart's fiefs. However, {{he decided to}} resist and gained the support of Leo of Cilicia and Aimery, King of Cyprus <b>and</b> <b>Jerusalem.</b> Bohemond traveled to Acre in summer 1204 to meet Marie of Champagne. Her husband, Baldwin, had been recently crowned emperor in Constantinople. He did homage to her, acknowledging the suzerainty of the Latin Emperors over Antioch. Marie tried to mediate a reconciliation between Bohemond and Leo of Cilicia, but she died in August.|$|E
5|$|In {{retaliation}} for his dismissal and his son's virtual demotion, Qasim al-Ahmad organized the a'ayan (notables) of Nablus, Hebron <b>and</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> against Ibrahim Pasha. On 19 May 1834, the notables gathered and notified Egyptian officials {{that they were}} not able to conscript the Palestinian Arab peasantry into the army or collect taxes from them, claiming that the peasantry had taken up arms and fled to the mountains which were difficult to access. At the time of the notables' stated failure to conscript local peasants, Ibrahim Pasha had been in need of new troops to replenish his army in preparation for further advances against the Ottomans. He considered the notables' position to be treasonous and amounting to an insurrection.|$|E
5|$|Leo {{tried to}} gain {{the support of the}} Holy See against Bohemond, {{promising}} to unite the Armenian Church with Rome. Pope Innocent III sent Cardinal Soffred Gaetani to Antioch in late spring 1203. Bohemond declined to meet the papal legate, stating that the patriarchs of Antioch <b>and</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> had excommunicated him for his debate with the Hospitallers. Gaetani mediated a reconciliation between Bohemond and the Hospitallers, but Bohemond insisted that the papal legate could not be mentioned in the agreement, because the Holy See could not make a judgement about feudal rights in the principality.|$|E

5|$|Manuel {{was very}} {{successful}} in expanding his influence, particularly over the Crusader states. As an example, he participated in the building and decorating {{of many of the}} basilicas and Greek monasteries in the Holy Land, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem where due to his efforts the Byzantine clergy were allowed to perform the Greek liturgy each day. All this reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states, with his hegemony over Antioch <b>and</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> secured by agreement with Raynald, Prince of Antioch, and Amalric, King of Jerusalem. This success in gaining influence and allies among the western states and the Pope is regarded one of the most impressive achievements of Manuel Komnenos's reign.|$|E
