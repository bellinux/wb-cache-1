The whole structure was bolted together at first, and later riveted by blacksmiths using hand-operated forges. Some individual spans were completed within <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>with</b> contractors being complimented on the efficiency of their work.|$|E
5|$|After being let go by Bordeaux, Valbuena put his {{ambitions of}} {{becoming}} a professional player on hold, and was recommended by Garcia to play for amateur club Langan-Castets in the Championnat de France amateur 2, the fifth division of French football. Unlike at Bordeaux where he trained numerous times a week, Valbuena only trained three times <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> Langon-Castets and, due to the club's amateur status, worked as a sports shop salesman {{when he was not}} playing football. In his only season at the club, he impressed with his technical ability and was subsequently recruited by Championnat National club Libourne Saint-Seurin who had scouted the player eight times while he was at Langon-Castets.|$|E

5|$|Born 22 September 1905 into {{a family}} of Finnish origin in Oslo (then named Kristiania), he was baptized Håkon Steen Lie. He would later change the {{spelling}} to Haakon during World War II. His father was fireman Andreas Lie (1870-1942) {{and his mother was}} homemaker Karen Halvorsdatter Gunderud (1871-1952). Though he describes his childhood as a happy one, his family was poor and, until 1916, his father had to work 120 hours <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>With</b> his parents, two brothers, and two sisters, he grew up at his fathers fire-station sharing one room and a kitchen in the St. Hanshaugen neighborhood. Lie got involved with the labour movement at the age of sixteen, in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{pages were}} filmed per day, six days <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>with</b> three shows {{completed}} per week. Shooting in order was not possible. Several barn segments might be filmed {{at a particular}} time with the crew then moving on to film an equal number of kitchen scenes. The shots may have then been used in four or five different episodes. Rettig was allowed to bond with the dog and often groomed the dog at the studio or spent weekends at Weatherwax's home playing with the animal. The bond translated to film, making the boy and dog scenes more believable, but, eventually the dog developed divided loyalties (looking to Rettig for direction rather than Weatherwax) and the trainer was forced to curtail the amount of time boy and dog spent together.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Pittston {{still felt}} {{the strain of}} {{providing}} benefits, with the cost per miner increasing by $3,746 from the 1979 amount. The company was still going into debt and having a difficult time paying for the miners' benefits. To avoid losing more money, Pittston doubled health deductibles, lowered the coverage from 100% to 80%, and discontinued benefits to miners who retired before 1974. This change {{in the health care}} plan was still not enough for the company to gain a profit, so they decided to keep the mines running 24hours a day and seven days <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>with</b> no overtime for the workers. Pittston also did away with successorship clauses, which meant that the miners of Pittston would not have job security or transfer of job rights in mines that were leased or sold. Miners were now working longer hours with more expensive health care plans, while the mine was losing no production time because it was never closed.|$|E

5|$|In November, Elizabeth Kloepfer, {{having read}} that young women were now disappearing in towns {{surrounding}} Salt Lake City, called King County police a second time. Detective Randy Hergesheimer of the Major Crimes division interviewed her in detail. By then, Bundy had risen considerably on the King County hierarchy of suspicion, but the Lake Sammamish witness considered most reliable by detectives failed to identify {{him from a}} photo lineup. In December, Kloepfer called the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office and repeated her suspicions. Bundy's name was added to their list of suspects, {{but at that time}} no credible evidence linked him to the Utah crimes. In January 1975 Bundy returned to Seattle after his final exams and spent <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> Kloepfer, who did not tell him that she had reported him to police on three separate occasions. She made plans to visit him in Salt Lake City in August.|$|E
5|$|Judge John Deed {{regularly}} {{formed the}} backbone of the BBC One winter schedule. The pilot and first series were broadcast on Tuesday evenings at 8p.m., with the second, third and fourth series moving to Thursday evenings (8:30p.m. for the first two and 8p.m. for the latter, though one episode in series three was postponed for over a month). The fifth series moved to Friday nights, and the sixth was shown two nights <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>with</b> {{the first part of the}} story on Tuesday nights and concluding the following Thursday. This series was also the first to be simulcast on BBC HD. Occasionally, due to a clash with regional programming, it has aired at different times on BBC One Scotland; series two was delayed for sometimes over a week while series three began a half-hour earlier. Series five had a six-day delay.|$|E

The brigade failed to capture Nofilia; although it cut the road, the Germans escaped during the night. The regiment was scheduled to camp at Nofilia for <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>with</b> C Squadron dispatched to guard the airfield at Sultan with a detachment of engineers to clear mines. The minefield was cleared by 23 December, when A Squadron replaced C Squadron. In late December, 18 new carriers arrived and the regiment prepared for another advance.|$|E

5|$|On July 10—when {{the storm}} was {{approaching}} or at its peak intensity with winds of —the Bowditch encountered severe hurricane conditions which destroyed both of her masts and washed her entire crew overboard. Her captain was able to climb back aboard, where he survived for over <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> no food or water until he was rescued by a schooner. The Echo and Creole both sustained significant damage, and the crew and captain of the latter ship had to be rescued after she began taking on water. The extent of {{the damage to the}} three ships served as the basis for evaluating the storm's intensity in Partagás's paper. The hurricane ultimately passed between Bermuda and the United States before dissipating after July 12.|$|E
5|$|Smith was {{instrumental}} in the inauguration of the air mail service by the United States Postal Service (USPS) in the summer of 1919. He had logged 900 hours of flying time in the Army before he joined the U.S. Mail Service at age nineteen. His first assignment was to fly mail from Omaha, Nebraska, to California, essentially following the same route as the Oregon Trail. His mother had taken this trail by covered wagon from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Cove, Oregon, in 1871. His mother and grandparents had taken two years to complete their trip, whereas Smith flew his route to California within <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> several stops along the way.|$|E

Ticket sales for the initial concert began on January 17, and half of them were sold within <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>with</b> the remainder sold by April 2, 2009. The concert was preceded by a Meet and Greet session that included the original composers as well as the arrangement team and guest artists for the show.
