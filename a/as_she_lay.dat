5|$|Elizabeth grew camellias {{in every}} one of her gardens, and before her flag-draped coffin was taken from Windsor to lie in state at Westminster Hall, an {{arrangement}} of camellias from her own gardens was placed on top. An estimated 200,000 people over three days filed past <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> in state in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster. Members of the household cavalry and other branches of the armed forces stood guard at the four corners of the catafalque. At one point, her four grandsons Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Viscount Linley mounted the guard as a mark of respect—an honour similar to the Vigil of the Princes at the lying in state of King George V.|$|E

As one of her last public appearances in September, she officially became a member of the American Red Cross. Following several months of deteriorating health that left her without the use of her lower limbs, as well as a diminished mental capacity rendering her incapable of recognizing her own house, her inner circle of friends and caregivers sat vigil for the last two weeks of her life knowing the end was near. In accordance with Hawaiian tradition, the royal kāhili fanned her <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> in bed.

25|$|At Rome, Marcus was {{occupied}} with family matters. Matidia, his great-aunt, had died. Her will was invalid under the lex Falcidia: Matidia had assigned {{more than three-quarters}} of her estate to non-relatives; her clients had convinced her to include them in codicils to her will. Matidia had never confirmed the documents, but, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> unconscious, her clients had sealed them in with the original, making them valid. It was an embarrassing situation. Fronto urged Marcus to push the family's case; Marcus demurred. He was going to consult his brother, who would make the final call.|$|E
25|$|Mai's role is more {{prominent}} in the anime. Early in the season she had problems with constantly moving; because she thought everyone hated her after making friends and then abandoning them, she became so depressed that she refused to go to school. She understood {{the impact of their}} journeys on others, but unlike Ai, did not have the maturity to cope with it. Early on in the series she makes friends with a classmate of hers, Konami. When it was time for Mai to leave, Konami helped convince Mai that she was wrong and in consolation Konami left a sketch portrait of Mai she made for a class assignment as a departing gift stating that they will remain friends forever, even if they never see each other again. While waiting for Mai's return, Konami passes away two years before the mansion is in a location where the two could meet again. Later in the series, Mai meets Konami's daughter; she initially mistakes her for Konami but quickly learns her name is Mai and that she was named by Konami in memory of her friend. Mai discovers that Konami's daughter has more in common with her than a name: she, like her namesake, feels that everyone hates her. As a result, Mai feels it her duty to both Konami and her daughter to show her that way of thinking was wrong, just as Konami did for her. Mai ultimately gave up and failed at the time when she Konami had still been waiting for her even <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> dying. This, compounded with Keith's words about the pain the girls bring to others, reawakening her depression in a much deeper manner. When she returns to visit Konami later and leaves, as a departing request, asks Konami to explain to her daughter what she felt so that she would not follow the same path as the younger sister Mai. Along with Mea, the maid, Mai is left at one point when the mansion disappears into the future without them. It is during this time that Mai realizes that she cannot age and Ai explains the connection to the mansion and aging process. Mai is voiced by Mio Oukawa in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Masumi Asano and in English by Nicole Bouma.|$|E

[...] Her last words were: [...] "I miss my {{daughter}} [...] and my grandchildren. I can not embrace {{her for the}} last time. Brazil, beautiful land... To there I can not return". The streets of Porto were crowded with people gathered to witness her funeral procession. By request of her husband, Teresa Cristina's body was carried to the Church of São Vicente de Fora near Lisbon, where it was interred in the Braganza Pantheon. Her remains, along with PedroII's, were later repatriated to Brazil in 1921 with much fanfare and pomp. They were given a final resting place in the Cathedral of Petrópolis in 1939.|$|E

50|$|All colonies {{are totally}} {{dependent}} on their queen, who is the only egg-layer. However, even the best queens live {{only a few years}} and one or two years longevity is the norm. She can choose whether or not to fertilize an egg <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> it; if <b>she</b> does so, it develops into a female worker bee; if <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> an unfertilized egg it becomes a male drone. She decides which type of egg to lay {{depending on the size of}} the open brood cell she encounters on the comb. In a small worker cell, <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> a fertilized egg; if she finds a larger drone cell, <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> an unfertilized drone egg.|$|R
500|$|Within {{a year of}} Louise Harrison's death, Harry {{was staying}} in Los Angeles with Harrison and Boyd, while Harrison worked with Ravi Shankar on the soundtrack to the film Raga. A Bengali Hindu, Shankar was distraught at {{the news of the}} {{humanitarian}} disaster then occurring in East Pakistan, following the outbreak of the Bangladesh Liberation War in March 1971. After fleeing the war zone in their homeland, an estimated 7 million refugees were being accommodated in inadequate camps in India, where diseases such as cholera had become rife. Shankar later recalled that Harrison was deeply moved by his request for help in aiding the Bengali refugees, as a result of which he committed to staging the Concert for Bangladesh in New York that summer. Author Elliot Huntley suggests that, having been incapable of assuaging his mother's pain <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> dying in 1970, Harrison gained extra motivation from [...] "a situation his fame and commercial cache could do something to alleviate".|$|E
500|$|The {{trial of}} all five {{was held at}} the Guild Hall in London on 10July 1762. [...] Presiding over the case was Lord Chief Justice William Murray. [...] Proceedings began at 10am, [...] "brought by William Kent against the above {{defendants}} for a conspiracy to take away his life by charging him with the murder of Frances Lynes by giving her poison whereof she died". [...] The courtroom was crowded with spectators, who watched as Kent gave evidence against those in the dock. [...] He told the court about his relationship with Fanny and of her resurrection as [...] "Scratching Fanny" [...] (so-called because of the scratching noises made by the [...] "ghost"). [...] James Franzen was next on the stand, his story corroborated by Fanny's servant, Esther [...] "Carrots" [...] Carlisle, who testified later that day. [...] Dr Cooper, who had served Fanny <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> dying, told the court that he had always believed the strange noises in Cock Lane to be a trick, and his account of Fanny's illness was supported by her apothecary, James Jones. [...] Several other prosecution witnesses described how the hoax had been revealed, and Richard James was accused by the prosecution's last witness of being responsible for some of the more offensive material published in the Public Ledger.|$|E
500|$|Kitty Kelly of The Chicago Tribune wrote, [...] "Two more {{attractive}} artists never collaborated {{in a single}} production than this star baby and this star dog. Of them {{it is impossible to}} say which is the more so, though one demonstrates the maximum of naturalness while the other is an exponent of the maximum of training. ... As a general thing, I disapprove of the agonies of film mortality and its frequent projection of cemetery scenes, but {{this is one of the}} situations that must be handed the label 'exception'. ... The picture is a miniature masterpiece." [...] Contained within her review Kelly, also mentioned that baby Helen was placed in front of the camera so that even <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> [...] "dying" [...] that she was still shown to be breathing. Kelly stated that no person would wish for a person to stop breathing for the sake of the film, but noted that it was not the best point of vision, but noted that the scene was well-managed. In Britain, The Bioscope reviewer agreed with other reviewers in finding the film to be, [...] "...a perfectly delightful little film. Although it is true that its plot, what there is of it, contains nothing very new, it is not merely a conventional dog and child picture of the ordinary type. It is, rather, an exquisite pictorial fancy, charmingly conceived for the most part and charmingly executed throughout. ... The picture is perfectly done, and not even in the ghost scenes toward the end is there anything banal or insincere in it. A film so full of tender sentiments and natural beauty should meet with the warmest of welcomes everywhere." ...|$|E
50|$|Katherine {{demonstrates}} all of {{the usual}} powers and abilities that vampires typically possess in The Vampire Diaries. However, at over five centuries old, she is considerably stronger and faster than many vampires, particularly {{at the beginning of}} Season 2. She appears to be particularly skilled at Dream Manipulation, even when inhabiting Elena's body. She demonstrates this skill multiple times in her early appearances, mainly toying with Stefan's subconscious and in her final episode, to comfort her daughter <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> dying.|$|R
50|$|Before breeding, {{the males}} clear {{an area of}} algae and {{invertebrates}} to create a nest. They engage in ritualised courtship displays, which may consist of rapid bursts of motion, chasing or nipping females, stationary hovering, or wide extension of their fins. After being attracted to the site, the female lays a string of sticky eggs that attach to the substrate. The male swims behind the female <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> the eggs, and fertilises them externally. Varying by species, brood sizes range from 50 to 1000 eggs.|$|R

500|$|At trial, {{it emerged}} that Capper had been kidnapped for [...] "insubstantial, even trivial" [...] reasons: Jean Powell claimed that Capper {{had tried to}} persuade her to sleep with a man for money; McNeilly and Dudson had {{contracted}} pubic lice which they believed were from a bed that Capper had also used; and McNeilly believed that she had taken a pink duffle coat that belonged to her. In November 1992, when Dudson had contracted pubic lice and had his pubic hair shaved, McNeilly told him she {{thought that he had}} caught them from Capper. Dudson believed otherwise, and said later: [...] "I told Jean [...] I thought I got them from Bernie [...]" [...] On 7 December 1992, Capper was lured to Jean Powell's home, where Glyn Powell and Dudson were already waiting. She was grabbed as soon as she arrived and held down while Glyn Powell shaved her head and her eyebrows and then made her clean up the hair and place it in a bin. Then he placed a plastic bag over her head and walked round her while hitting her on the head. She was then kicked by Jean Powell and McNeilly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> curled up on the floor and both women took turns beating her with a three-foot-long (1 m) wooden instrument and a belt. She was then taken to the bathroom and forced to shave off her own pubic hair as [...] "ritual humiliation in revenge for having caused, as they claimed, Dudson and McNeilly themselves to be shaved." [...] Afterwards Jean Powell locked her in a cupboard overnight. The following morning she was taken upstairs and locked in another cupboard. On 8 December she was transferred to McNeilly's house because of concern that Powell and McNeilly's six children were disturbed by Capper's crying. There she was tied spreadeagle to an upturned bed with electrical flex in a downstairs back room.|$|E

50|$|When {{conditions}} are warm and humid, winged {{males and females}} participate in a nuptial flight. They emerge from their satellite nests and females mate {{with a number of}} males while in flight. The males die after mating. These newly fertilized queens discard their wings and search for new areas to establish primary nests. The queens build new nests and deposit around 20 eggs, nurturing them as they grow until worker ants emerge. The worker ants eventually assist her in caring for the brood <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> more eggs. Again, satellite nests will be established and the process will repeat itself.|$|R

She may have made statements about a motive but in 1999, the only surviving witness to this incident wrote that at the time, he was young, distracted by the immediate crisis of her heart attack, {{had no knowledge of}} who William Desmond Taylor was or what she was talking about.
