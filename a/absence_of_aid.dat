In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> tying, foreign exchange from pure aid {{must always be}} more valuable than an equivalent amount of foreign exchange from exports. Thus, two alternative interpretations of the slogan are considered.

Under imperfect capital markets, firms might encounter difficulties in accessing sufficient resources to fund their optimal investment plans.

To this end, we use all state aid cases that were active in Belgian manufacturing between 2002 and 2011.

40|$|Understanding the {{development}} effects of official aid {{is crucial to}} building a better bridge between research and policy. This paper reviews the current evidence regarding the impact of aid on growth and poverty reduction, and develops a new narrative. In the light of this narrative, the paper then examines aid trends, focusing on the regions of sub-Saharan Africa and the Pacific. The paper then turns to recent discussion of new and innovative sources of development finance and considers how research has influenced the policy debate through a recent UNU-WIDER study for the UN General Assembly.

Pathogenic IgG autoantibody production requires B-cell activation, leading to the production of activation-induced deaminase (AID) and class switching of IgM genes to IgG. To understand how and when B cells are activated to produce these IgG autoantibodies, we studied cells from 564 Igi, a mouse model of SLE. 564 Igi mice develop a disease profile closely resembling that found in human SLE patients, including the presence of IgG antinucleic acid Abs. We have generated 564 Igi mice that conditionally express an activation-induced cytidine deaminase transgene (Aicda tg), either in all B cells or only in mature B cells. Here, we show that class-switched pathogenic IgG autoantibodies were produced only in 564 Igi mice in which AID was functional in early-developing B cells, resulting in loss of tolerance. Furthermore, we show that the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>AID</b> in early-developing B cells also results in increased production of self-reactive IgM, indicating that AID, through somatic hypermutation, contributes to tolerance.

40|$|The {{literature}} on aid {{has come a}} long way in recent years, and as a result we now know much more about aid effectiveness than possibly ever before. But significant gaps in knowledge remain. One such gap is the effectiveness of aid in the so-called ?fragile states?, countries with critically low policy and institutional performance ratings. The current paper addresses this void by examining possible links between aid and economic growth in fragile states. It finds that: (i) growth would have been 1. 4 percentage points lower in highly fragile states in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> to them, compared to 2. 5 percentage points in other countries; (ii) highly fragile states from a per capita income growth perspective can only efficiently absorb approximately one-third of the amounts of aid that other countries can, and; (iii) while from the same perspective most fragile states are under-aided, to the extent that they could efficiently absorb greater amounts of aid than they currently receive, many of the highly fragile states are substantially over-aided in this sense. The overall conclusion is that donors need to look very closely at their aid to the sub-set of fragile states deemed in this paper as highly fragile. foreign aid, economic growth, fragile states, policies, absorptive capacity...|$|E

Since Pax- 5 and Id- 2 transcription factors play an opposing role in AID regulation, we have studied the expression of Pax- 5, Id- 2, and prdm- 1 genes in 54 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells. In 21 cases, presence of AID is constantly associated with high expression of the complete form of the Pax- 5 gene (Pax- 5 a) and lower expression of the Id- 2 and prdm- 1 transcripts. In 33 cases, the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>AID</b> expression and CSR is associated with a reduction of Pax- 5 a and the appearance of a spliced form with a deletion in exon 8 (Pax- 5 /Delta-Ex 8). Stimulation with CD 40 L+interleukin 4 (IL- 4) induces CSR, the presence of AID transcripts, up-regulation of Pax- 5 a and down-regulation of Pax- 5 /Delta-Ex 8, and Id- 2 and prdm- 1 transcripts. Pax- 5 a and Pax- 5 /Delta-Ex 8 are translated into 2 isoforms of the B-cell-specific activator protein (BSAP) and both are able to bind the AID-promoter region.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} excess cost which results from aid-tying in some {{development}} {{projects in the}} Sudan. Tying can be of two types, either by source or by end-use. In the former case, restrictions are placed on where the recipients can spend the assistance. In the latter case, assistance is limited to specific items or projects. Thus, aid can be deemed to be doubly tied. In addition, there are other unquantifiable costs of tying. For example, the project to which the assistance will be tied might not suit the recipient's development programme, or the technology used may be inappropriate. Eight foreign-aided projects, which were tied by source {{as well as by}} end-use, were analysed to estimate the excess cost which results from the tying of aid. The overall weighted average of tying these projects appears to be 74 percent higher than the international market. In addition, the analysis shows that the terms of borrowing for these projects were hard; consequently, the grant element was low. Thus, if one takes into account the estimated excess cost of the tied foreign credits, which was greater than the commercial cost of borrowing at which these credits could have been sought in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid,</b> the real value of these credits, the paper shows by using a shadow grant element approach, was negative. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} aid on {{per capita income}} growth has been a {{particularly}} controversial topic among researchers and policy-makers alike. Most studies agree that growth would be lower in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> This is evident from comprehensive literature surveys of aid and growth studies, including Hansen and Tarp (2000), Morrissey (2001), McGillivray et al. (2006), Mekasha and Tarp (2011) and Clemens et al. (2012). There is no such agreement in this literature regarding what {{might be described as}} the contingencies on which the impact of aid on growth is partially dependent. Debate over this topic is intensive and a failure to reach agreement over it is arguably the principal failing of the aid-growth literature owing to the potential guidance such agreement could provide for the selection of interventions aimed at improving aid effectiveness. Debate on aid-growth contingencies commenced after publication of the pioneering econometric investigation of Burnside and Dollar (1997, 2000). Burnside and Dollar multiplicatively interacted aid with a measure of policy, and found that aid only had a positive impact on growth in developing countries with good fiscal, monetary, and trade policies. Subsequent studies have sought to test the robustness of the Burnside and Dollar result, test for the relevance of different contingencies, or both. No study has been able to replicate the Burnside and Dollar result, and as such there is widespread concern in the research community over its robustness...|$|E
40|$|The Aid Effectiveness Literature has {{recently}} investigated {{the effects of}} foreign aid on economic growth through country policies. Different results have been reached across different studies mainly due to their sensitivity to policy measures and data samples. The internal political setting of LDCs may influence the effect of aid over policy distortions and represent a rea- son for this ambiguity. I present a model {{in which the government}} has complete control over the policy implementation. The interaction with a domestic special interest group which benefits from distortions and a benevolent donor agency affects its decisions. I show that, while the government is always better off when foreign aid is present, the economy may be characterized by a more or less distorted equilibrium depending on the way aid modifies the policy effect on economic welfare. When aid is more effective (it reduces the negative effect of the distortion on welfare) the government has an incentive to pursue higher levels of distortion in order to extract a larger contribution from the lobby. Aid and the policy distortion become substitutes in the governments utility. Hence the distortion in equilibrium is larger than the "natural" level it would occur in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> In such a case, the ability of the lobby to extract gains from aid non trivially leads to a less distorted equilibrium. The same result generally yields when aid is conditional on the policy implemented. Anyway I show that the possibility for more-distorted equilibria to arise does not completely disappear. When the "natural" distortion of the economy is large, a benevolent donor might still have an incentive in not properly addressing conditionality issues...|$|E

Understanding the route-choice behaviour of road-users requires consideration of the information about the travel environment available to them. An assumption of perfect information about the layout of the travel environment and the traffic conditions within it is a convenient simplification - but is also wholly unrealistic.

40|$|The {{processes}} of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR) of Ig genes are {{initiated by the}} activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). In SHM, AID cre-ates cytidine (C) to uridine (U) mutations, start-ing 100 – 200 bp from the promoter within the variable (V) region and in flanking DNA sequences and extending for 2 kb (Longerich et al., 2006; Storck et al., 2011). Error-prone lesion-bypass polymerases introduce mutations at the U and sequences within {{a dozen or so}} nucleotides {{in the vicinity of the}} U, and both mis-match repair (MMR) and base excision repair (BER) proteins are involved in the error pro-cesses (Rada et al., 2002, 2004; Shen et al., 2006). AID-initiated SHM and CSR are essential for generating the antibody repertoire that is necessary to acquire resistance to infections (Wei et al., 2011). We have also found that the protooncogene BCL 6 is mutated in human memory B cells (Shen et al., 1998). Addition-ally, other protooncogenes have been reported to become active and mutated in transformed germinal center B cells (Pasqualucci et al., 2001). In fact, it appears that AID can mutate many genes expressed in germinal center B cells un-dergoing SHM (Liu et al., 2008; Storb et al., 2009; Tanaka et al., 2010). <b>Absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>AID</b> re-sults in immunodeficiencies (Conley et al., 2009); however, AID is also a potentially dangerous mutator.

40|$|Can cash {{transfers}} promote {{employment and}} reduce poverty in rural Africa? Will lower youth unemployment and poverty {{reduce the risk}} of social instability? The authors experimentally evaluate one of Uganda's largest development programs, which provided thousands of young people nearly unconditional, unsupervised cash transfers to pay for vocational training, tools, and business start-up costs. Mid-term results after two years suggest four main findings. First, despite a lack of central monitoring and accountability, most youth invest the transfer in vocational skills and tools. Second, the economic impacts of the transfer are large: hours of non-household employment double and cash earnings increase by nearly 50 percent relative to the control group. The authors estimate the transfer yields a real annual return on capital of 35 percent on average. Third, the evidence suggests that poor access to credit is a major reason youth cannot start these vocations in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> Much of the heterogeneity in impacts is unexplained, however, and is unrelated to conventional economic measures of ability, suggesting we have much to learn about the determinants of entrepreneurship. Finally, these economic gains result in modest improvements in social stability. Measures of social cohesion and community support improve mildly, by roughly 5 to 10 percent, especially among males, most likely because the youth becomes a net giver rather than a net taker in his kin and community network. Most strikingly, we see a 50 percent fall in interpersonal aggression and disputes among males, but a 50 percent increase among females. Neither change seems related to economic performance nor does social cohesion a puzzle to be explored in the next phase of the study. These results suggest that increasing access to credit and capital could stimulate employment growth in rural Africa. In particular, unconditional and unsupervised cash transfers may be a more effective and cost-efficient forming of large-scale aid than commonly believed. A second stage of data collection in 2012 will collect longitudinal economic impacts, additional data on political violence and behavior, and explore alternative theoretical mechanisms.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the question of}} aid effectiveness through a comparative historical analysis of the external financing constraints of two icons of development studies: South Korea and Brazil. The selection of these contrasting cases {{is based on a}} method of difference, designed to examine the predicaments of two countries attempting similar developmentalist strategies of sustained industrial policy through successive stages of industrialization, but with differences in amounts of aid supporting such strategies. This approach differs from the standard approach in the literature of examining economic performance among aid recipient countries and it is adopted as a means to highlight the challenges that some of the most successful and advanced late industrialisers of the post-war era have faced in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> The comparison draws on an analytical framework that locates aid effectiveness in the interaction of both aid absorption (via current accounts deficits) and development strategy (via industrial policy), the latter {{based on the premise that}} unconstrained strategies of post-war late industrialisation have exhibited inherent structural tendencies to generate merchandise trade deficits. The interaction establishes an important, yet mostly overlooked, symbiosis between global redistribution and development. This symbiosis is then demonstrated by the historical analysis of the external accounts of the two cases, which constitutes the original empirical contribution of the article given that inductive historical analysis of actual interactions between aid flows (or lack thereof) and external accounts has been essentially absent in the aid literature. Similarly, the literatures on industrial policy and developmental states tend to exhibit a domestic productionist bias that has also shunned serious analyses of the role of aid in supporting successful late industrialisation experiences. Accordingly, the case of South Korea clearly illustrates the crucial role that aid played in buttressing rapid late industrialisation against structural external constraints and financial vulnerabilities. The contrasting case of Brazil clearly demonstrates the constraints faced by late industrialising countries in the absence of generous supplies of aid and/or stable, secure and affordable finance. The conclusion reflects on some of the wider implications of these insights and also offers some comparative reflections on China as an alternative model for dealing with similar constraints...|$|E
