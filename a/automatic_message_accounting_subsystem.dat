50|$|AMATPS is an Operations Support System {{developed}} during the early 1980s by the Bell System and Bell Communications Research. AMATPS is an acronym that stands for <b>Automatic</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Accounting</b> Tele-Processing System.

Nearly all wireline and wireless telecommunications companies utilize similar technologies today to transport near-real-time billing information.|$|R
25|$|Many of {{the urban}} and {{commercial}} areas where Panel was first used had message rate service rather than flat rate calling. For this reason the line finder had, besides the tip and ring leads for talking and the sleeve lead for control, a fourth wire for the District circuit to send metering pulses to control the message register. The introduction of direct distance dialing (DDD) in the 1950s required the addition of automatic number identification equipment for centralized <b>automatic</b> <b>message</b> <b>accounting.</b>|$|R

50|$|As in {{previous}} designs, supervision of incoming calls is handled by relay sets known as incoming trunk circuits. Unlike {{in previous}} designs, {{this work is}} also done in the trunk circuit for outgoing calls, {{so there are no}} junctor circuits. Since different outgoing trunks are connected to different places and are used for different calls, their relay sets can be specialized for a particular kind of signalling or call metering (see <b>automatic</b> <b>message</b> <b>accounting)</b> or other peculiarity. Thus a TSPS trunk can give complete control to an operator, while an E and M signaling trunk can do the kind of signaling required of a private long-distance line, while a local outgoing trunk can be simpler.|$|R

5000|$|As {{this and}} other {{improved}} technologies became available, as well as <b>Automatic</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Accounting</b> (AMA) computers to process the long distance records into customer bills, the reach of DDD was slow in the 1950s, but quickened in the early 1960s. Electronic switching systems with stored-program capability allowed electronic processing of the dialed digits, referring to electronic memories to determine call routing, and this has reached {{the state of the}} art, with digital telephone exchanges which are basically specialized computers that route voice traffic from one [...] "peripheral" [...] to another as digital data. Call routing can now be done based on the area code, central office code and even the first two digits of the line number, although routing based on digits past the central office code is usually limited to cases of competitive local exchange carriers, number pooling and number portability.|$|R

The tasks of the <b>accounting</b> <b>subsystems</b> in the process of development and realization of the enterprise economic security strategy were defined.
