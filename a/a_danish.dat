5|$|Cochrane {{prepared}} for {{an encounter with}} this Spanish vessel by painting Speedy to resemble <b>a</b> <b>Danish</b> brig then in the Mediterranean, the Clomer. He also appointed a Dane as quartermaster and found him <b>a</b> <b>Danish</b> naval officer's uniform. While cruising off Alicante on 21 December, Speedy encountered an enemy frigate, but tricked her into thinking she was a neutral vessel. Cochrane again used this false flag technique to his advantage; on 22January he was sailing with a convoy of Danish merchantmen under <b>a</b> <b>Danish</b> flag, pretending to escort them. When a 10-gun French ship and 8-gun Spanish brig approached, Cochrane hoisted British colours and attacked, capturing both of them.|$|E
