500|$|Pick {{introduced}} a common <b>advertising</b> <b>policy,</b> improving {{the appearance of}} stations by standardising poster sizes, limiting the number used and controlling their positioning. Before he took control of advertising, posters had been stuck up on any available surface on station buildings and platform walls in a crowded jumble of shapes and sizes that led to complaints from passengers {{that it was difficult}} to find the station name. Pick standardised commercial poster sizes on printers' double crown sheets, arranging these in organised groups to enable the station name to be easily seen. The Underground's own promotional posters were smaller, using single or paired double royal sheets, and were arranged separately from the commercial advertising. Pick described the process: [...] "after many fumbling experiments I arrived at some notion of how poster advertising ought to be. Everyone seemed quite pleased and I got a reputation that really sprang out of nothing." ...|$|E

40|$|We propose {{an optimal}} control problem {{to model the}} {{dynamics}} of the communication activity of a firm with the aim of maximizing its efficiency. We assume that the advertising effort undertaken by the firm contributes to increase the firm's goodwill and that the goodwill affects the firm's sales. The aim is to find the <b>advertising</b> <b>policies</b> in order to maximize the firm's efficiency index which is computed as the ratio between "outputs" and "inputs" properly weighted; the outputs are represented by the final level of goodwill and by the sales achieved by the firm during the period considered, whereas the inputs are represented by the costs undertaken by the firm, fixed costs and advertising costs. The problem considered is formulated as a fractional optimal control problem. In order to find the optimal <b>advertising</b> <b>policies</b> we use the Dinkelbach's algorithm for fractional programming. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{equilibrium}} profit-maximizing <b>advertising</b> <b>policies</b> {{of firms}} {{operating in a}} dynamic duopoly are derived by linking in a single framework the econometric estimation of the market response function and the technique of differential games that characterizes dynamic competitive behavior. We use the Lanchester model of combat to represent the system dynamics that capture the competitive shifts due to investments in advertising by the two market rivals. We determine the equilibrium advertising levels using both closed- and open-loop policies. We also compare these equilibrium <b>advertising</b> <b>policies</b> for each firm to those obtained using an optimal control theory formulation wherein the advertising spending levels of the rival {{are assumed to be}} known. The empirical results obtained by analyzing the advertising rivalry between Coke and Pepsi for the period 1968 – 1981 under the above three alternative spending policies provide some interesting insights into the nature of competition between these two market rivals.

40|$|Internet {{search engines}} display {{advertisements}} along with search results, {{providing them with}} {{a major source of}} revenue. The display of ads is triggered by the use of keywords, which are found in the searches performed by search engine users. The fact that advertisers can buy a keyword that contains a trademark they do not own has caused controversy worldwide. To explore the actual effects of trademark and keyword <b>advertising</b> <b>policies,</b> we exploit a natural experiment in Europe. Following a decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union, Google relaxed its AdWords policy in continental Europe in September 2010. After the policy change, Google allowed advertisers to select a third party’s trademark as a keyword to trigger the display of ads. We use click-stream data from European Internet users to explore the impact this policy change had on browsing behavior. Based on a data set of 5. 38 million web site visits before and after the policy change, we find little average change. However, we present evidence that this lack of average effect stems from an aggregation of two opposing effects. While navigational searches are less likely to lead to the trademark owner’s website, non-navigational searches are more likely to lead to the trademark owner’s website after the policy change. The effect of changing keyword <b>advertising</b> <b>policies</b> varies with the purpose of the consumers using the trademark. It is the resulting tradeoffs, rather than consumer confusion, on which th...|$|R

The NFL responded to the claims by denying any involvement in {{the rejection of the}} advertisement, but it did confirm that its policy does ban advertisements with firearms in them and in the end the advertisement was not accepted.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately troubled {{times were}} ahead for her company. Ball {{realized}} that their telephone number and address had been printed incorrectly {{in one of}} her major advertisements. Their telephone number had also been removed from the directory. This forced her to get a new phone number. At the same time, Dateline was becoming more and more successful and was able to leverage the fact the newspapers already took Com-Pat's advertisements to place its own ads in the same papers without the difficulties that Ball had faced earlier. In 1971, there was a Post Office strike which halted all mail. It lasted almost eight weeks and Ball's business couldn't do anything during that time. Everything hit an all time low when the Daily Telegraph, the company's most successful advertising venue, refused to continue printing ads for Com-Pat because the paper had changed their <b>advertising</b> <b>policy.</b> Joan became depressed and felt unable to cope. At the same time, the UK was wracked with major strikes and economic problems: The miners' strike was causing chaos nationwide by disrupting the country's ability to produce electricity and power the government, businesses and industries that kept the economy functioning.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we empirically analyze weekly <b>advertising</b> <b>policies</b> of {{manufacturing}} firms in consumer goods markets. We assume firms engage in persuasive <b>advertising,</b> thus <b>policies</b> of firms affect the goodwill of a brand. We introduce a demand and a goodwill production function. A simple {{transformation of the}} demand function allows us to identify not only the demand parameters but also {{the parameters of the}} goodwill production function. We reconstruct the unobserved goodwill levels using these parameters and past advertising levels. We restrict our attention to Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE) strategies which are functions of payoff relevant state variables. Without imposing further restrictions on the dynamic competitive environment, we investigate the relationship between observed advertising strategies—which are assumed to be MPE—and payoff relevant state variables by means of several reduced form specifications. The most important determinant of advertising intensity turns out to be goodwill. We demonstrate that controlling for an advertising campaign significantly improves the explanatory power of the model.
