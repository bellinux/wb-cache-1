5|$|The chapel's Collegiate Gothic design evokes an English {{church of}} the Middle Ages, {{although}} several <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> including the vault and its supports, recall French churches. The chapel is cruciform and is built {{on the scale of}} a large parish church or a small cathedral. The only precedent for a university chapel of this size was King's College Chapel, and {{only a small part of}} that chapel was used regularly. Stillwell cites Exeter Cathedral and the Octagon tower of Ely Cathedral as precedents for the architectural detail, but notes that the Princeton chapel's detail nonetheless differs significantly from these.|$|E
25|$|The commons {{dilemma is}} a {{specific}} class of social dilemma in which people's short-term selfish interests {{are at odds with}} long-term group interests and the common good.

25|$|So far, {{attempts}} to firmly link the legendary Ragnar {{with one or}} several of those men have failed {{because of the difficulty}} in reconciling the various accounts and their chronology. Nonetheless, the core tradition of a Viking hero named Ragnar (or similar) who wreaked havoc in mid-ninth-century Europe and who fathered many famous sons is remarkably persistent, and some <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> are covered by relatively reliable sources, such as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{uncertainty}} principle {{is such a}} basic result in quantum mechanics, typical experiments in quantum mechanics routinely observe <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Certain experiments, however, may deliberately test a particular form of {{the uncertainty}} principle {{as part of their}} main research program. These include, for example, tests of number–phase uncertainty relations in superconducting or quantum optics systems. Applications dependent on the uncertainty principle for their operation include extremely low-noise technology such as that required in gravitational wave interferometers.|$|E

25|$|The mind–body {{problem in}} {{philosophy}} examines {{the relationship between}} mind and matter, {{and in particular the}} relationship between consciousness and the brain. A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either dualist or monist. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. Monism maintains {{that there is only one}} kind of stuff, and that mind and matter are both <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The problem was addressed by pre-Aristotelian philosophers, and was famously addressed by René Descartes in the 17th century, resulting in Cartesian dualism. Descartes believed that humans only, and not other animals have this non-physical mind.|$|E
25|$|Beckett {{travelled}} in Europe. He {{spent some}} time in London, where in 1931 he published Proust, his critical study of French author Marcel Proust. Two years later, following his father's death, he began two years' treatment with Tavistock Clinic psychoanalyst Dr. Wilfred Bion. <b>Aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> became evident in Beckett's later works, such as Watt and Waiting for Godot. In 1932, he wrote his first novel, Dream of Fair to Middling Women, but after many rejections from publishers decided to abandon it (it was eventually published in 1992). Despite his inability to get it published, however, the novel served as a source for many of Beckett's early poems, as well as for his first full-length book, the 1933 short-story collection More Pricks Than Kicks.|$|E
25|$|Southey was {{intrigued}} by the Zend Avesta and in Zoroastrianism. In particular, the aspects of a dualistic moral system along {{with a focus on}} death appealed to the poet. He wanted to create a poem based in the ideas and dealing with a Persian prince, but he was unable to write the poem. Instead, he incorporated <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> including how evil allows for the shaping of good, to enter into Kehama. Other theological aspects involved the Hindu pantheon to have an epic with gods that both behind the scenes and directly within the story of the epic. The evil discussed in the poem had a contemporary and political model. It paralleled Southey's belief that Napoleon was becoming an Antichrist figure who would set up a reverse millennium.|$|E

25|$|The recent Evangelical theologian John Stott {{argued that}} penal {{substitution}} {{and the moral}} influence view can be harmonized to an extent. Historically the two theories {{were considered to be}} in strong opposition (e.g. Anselm vs Abelard, the Reformers vs Socinianism), so Stott's attempt at harmonization represents a novel approach. Stott's influential work has led many recent Evangelicals to view the moral influence view as an aspect of penal substitution and harmonizable with it. Stott taught that the penal substitutionary view was primarily the correct explanation of the atonement. He regarded the moral influence theory taken alone to be 'untenable'. Yet while rejecting the moral influence view as a whole, Stott believed that some <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> (and of the Ransom theory of atonement) could be endorsed by those holding penal substitution. The aspects of the moral influence view he identified as most suitable for harmonisation are its focus on sanctification, and its idea of Christ as a teacher who inspires us. Stott rejected as unharmonizable the teachings of the moral influence theory regarding sin, the cross, and free forgiveness without atonement.|$|E

Eos, however, forgot to ask for eternal youth and Tithonus indeed lived forever but prayed every sunrise for death. The final aspect of history used by Gilligan was the yellow fever epidemic in the 19th century.|$|E
