In 1997 the railway was replaced by Tramlink; the station is now Woodside tram stop.|$|E

Other hybrids include the zorse, a cross between a zebra and <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> a zonkey or zedonk, a hybrid of a zebra and a donkey.

Skírnir rides out to a herdsman (unnamed) sitting on a mound, greets him, and asks the herdsman how he may speak to the maiden beyond Gymir's dogs.

Further along, the neighbor encountered Desha on foot, carrying two saddlebags. Desha {{said that he had}} just accepted the gray mare as payment from a man who owed him money. He did not volunteer how the two horses had escaped his control, but mounted the gray mare and returned home. Later that day, friends at Desha's tannery noticed that he was unusually quiet and repeatedly asked what was wrong. He said that he had been kicked by <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> severely cut his finger in separate incidents the previous day.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{improved}} the bread-making operation by introducing Israel's first automated weighing machines and investing in new production lines.

It delivered bread to stores in two trucks and <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> wagon. During World War II, the bakery contracted to supply bread to the British army, necessitating the purchase of large American-made ovens that could turn out 540 loaves per hour.|$|E

Around noon, Jackalow was turned away from crossing a railroad bridge, then under construction in Newark, New Jersey, by workman William Jacobus, who recognized Jackalow. His colleague Henry Wilson mentioned a $1000 reward for Jackalow's arrest, and the pair—joined by John Sanford and John Douglass, and aided by a spy glass—spotted Jackalow heading for the Newark Plank Road. Jacobus and Douglass pursued Jackalow, while Wilson and Sanford took the car to Newark, hired <b>a</b> <b>horse,</b> <b>and</b> set out to intercept him on the road.|$|E

With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, Holmes {{published}} a book dedicated to the life and works of his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson. Later biographers would use Holmes's book as an outline for their own studies, but particularly useful was the section dedicated to Emerson's poetry, into which Holmes had particular insight. Beginning in January 1885, Holmes's third and last novel, A Mortal Antipathy, was published serially in The Atlantic Monthly. Later that year, Holmes contributed $10 to Walt Whitman, {{though he did not}} approve of his poetry, and convinced friend John Greenleaf Whittier to do the same. A friend of Whitman, a lawyer named Thomas Donaldson, had requested monetary donations from several authors to purchase <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> buggy for Whitman who, in his old age, was becoming a shut-in.|$|E

Revanta is depicted seated on <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> accompanied by a hunting dog. Revanta's attendants are depicted with various hunting weapons like lances and swords. Some of them are shown blowing a conch or beaming drums or holding an umbrella {{over the head of}} their lord, the umbrella being the symbol of royalty.

5|$|Patton {{continued}} playing polo and sailing in this time. After sailing back to Los Angeles {{for extended}} leave in 1937, he was kicked by <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> fractured his leg. Patton developed phlebitis from the injury, which nearly killed him. The incident almost forced Patton out of active service, but a six-month administrative assignment in the Academic Department at the Cavalry School at Fort Riley {{helped him to}} recover. Patton was promoted to colonel on July 24, 1938 and given command of the 5th Cavalry at Fort Clark, Texas, for six months, a post he relished, but he was reassigned to Fort Myer again in December as commander of the 3rd Cavalry. There, he met Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall, who {{was so impressed with}} him that Marshall considered Patton a prime candidate for promotion to general. In peacetime, though, he would remain a colonel to remain eligible to command a regiment.|$|E
