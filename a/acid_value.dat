Further extending the storage period over 12 months, the increase in <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> of JME was up to 0.58 mg KOH/g. On the other hand, for the sample stored over a period of 6 months at 4 °C in light and sealed condition, increase in the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> was measured as 0.44 to 0.50 mg KOH/g. After, 12 months of storage, the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> further increased up to 0.80 mg KOH/g. In the samples stored at 25 °C over a period of 12 months in sealed and dark condition, significant increase in the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> (i.e., 0.44 to 1.5 mg KOH/g) was observed. Whereas, in the same sample stored in sealed condition but exposed to light, the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> after 12 months of extended storage increases from of 0.44 to 1.8 mg KOH/g. The <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> of methyl ester after 12 months of storage which was kept at 35 °C under dark and sealed condition increases from 0.44 to 5.0 mg KOH/g; whereas, in light and sealed condition, the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> increased from 0.44 to 6.0 mg KOH/g. From this, it is clear that prolonged exposure of light on JME samples fastens the degradation rate compared to the dark condition.

During the oxidation process of methyl esters, it usually forms a radical next to double bond which quickly binds with oxygen in air [23]. This forms peroxide, which immediately forms new radical, and thus, the process of radical auto-oxidation cycle starts which exponentially increases {{the degradation of}} methyl esters. Figure  1 c shows the change in <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> of the JME sample stored in exposure to air. At the beginning (0 month), the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> of JME was around 0.44 mg KOH/g. After 6 months of storage, the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> increased from 0.44 to 3.9 mg KOH/g for the samples which are kept at 4 °C and exposed to air; whereas, for the sample stored at the same temperature but under sealed condition, increase was not significant, i.e., 0.5 mg KOH/g (Figure  1 b,c). Further extending the storage period over 12 months, the increase in <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> was up to 4.8 mg KOH/g for the sample which was kept in exposure to air; whereas, maximum increase in the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> was found up to 0.8 mg KOH/g for the sealed sample (Figure  1 b,c). The samples which were kept at 25 °C in exposure to air, the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> after 6 months of storage was also found to increase from 0.44 to 6.37 mg KOH/g (Figure  1 c). On the other hand, maximum increase in the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> was up to 1.4 mg KOH/g for air-tight sample (Figure  1 b). Over 12 months of storage, the increase in <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> was up to 14.1 mg KOH/g for air-exposed JME sample and 1.8 mg KOH/g for air-tight sample stored at 25 °C (Figure  1 b,c). On the other hand, the samples that are stored at 35 °C and exposed to air, the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> after 6 months of storage was found to increase to 9.3 mg KOH/g; whereas, in sealed condition, the maximum increase was up to 4 mg KOH/g (Figure  1 b,c).
