40|$|Abstract. The use of metamodels as surrogates of {{time-consuming}} functions has widely spread {{within the}} academia and the industry. In this paper, two metamodels are considered for crashworthiness design of an automotive body structure, namely Kriging and support vector regression. Variants {{of these two}} metamodels associated with various kernel or <b>auto-correlation</b> <b>functions</b> are first compared on analytical functions. The conclusions of this benchmark analysis are then considered to select the most appropriate ones for application on the so-called sidemember subsystem. This is a subsystem of an automotive front end under frontal impact. The outputs to emulate are highly non-linear and noisy. The SVR and Kriging models are shown to produce roughly {{the same level of}} accuracy for prediction when considered with isotropic kernels or <b>auto-correlation</b> <b>functions,</b> with a slight advantage to Kriging. Besides, the anisotropy in the <b>auto-correlation</b> <b>functions</b> clearly improves the Kriging surrogates. Some outputs of the crash simulation were however hard to surrogate...|$|R

40|$|We develop novel {{methods to}} compute <b>auto-correlation</b> <b>functions,</b> or power {{spectral}} densities, for chaotic dynamical systems generated by an inverse method whose {{starting point is}} an invariant distribution and a two-form. In general, the inverse method makes some aspects of chaotic dynamics calculable by methods familiar in quantum field theory. This approach has the numerical advantage of being amenable to Monte-Carlo parallel computation. We demonstrate the approach on a specific example, and show how <b>auto-correlation</b> <b>functions</b> can be computed without any direct numerical simulation, by Pade approximants of a short time expansion.

40|$|We {{present a}} Galilean invariant, {{momentum}} conserving first order Brownian dynamics scheme for coarse-grained simulations of highly frictional soft matter systems. Friction forces {{are taken to}} be with respect to moving background material. The motion of the background material is described by locally averaged velocities {{in the neighborhood of}} the dissolved coarse coordinates. The velocity variables are updated by a momentum conserving scheme. The properties of the stochastic updates are derived through the Chapman-Kolmogorov and Fokker-Planck equations for the evolution of the probability distribution of coarse-grained position and velocity variables, by requiring the equilibrium distribution to be a stationary solution. We test our new scheme on concentrated star polymer solutions and find that the transverse current and velocity time <b>auto-correlation</b> <b>functions</b> behave as expected from hydrodynamics.

Using an experimental setup with a fast two-dimensional detector and performing X-ray correlation spectroscopy by calculating two-dimensional maps of the intensity <b>auto-correlation</b> <b>functions,</b> it was possible to evaluate the sample structure and furthermore to characterize the detailed flow behavior, including flow geometry, main flow directions, advective flow velocities and diffusive dynamics. By scanning a microfocused X-ray beam over a microfluidic device, the anisotropic <b>auto-correlation</b> <b>functions</b> of driven colloidal suspensions in straight, curved and constricted microchannels were mapped with the spatial resolution of the X-ray beam.

50|$|To {{analyze the}} signals well, {{choosing}} an appropriate time-frequency distribution function is important. Which time-frequency distribution function {{should be used}} depends on the application being considered, as shown by reviewing a list of applications. The high clarity of the Wigner distribution function (WDF) obtained for some signals {{is due to the}} <b>auto-correlation</b> <b>function</b> inherent in its formulation; however, the latter also causes the cross-term problem. Therefore, if we want to analyze a single-term signal, using the WDF may be the best approach; if the signal is composed of multiple components, some other methods like the Gabor transform, Gabor-Wigner distribution or Modified B-Distribution functions may be better choices.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic light {{scattering}} (DLS) {{is a technique}} in physics {{that can be used}} to determine the size distribution profile of small particles in suspension or polymers in solution. In the scope of DLS, temporal fluctuations are usually analyzed by means of the intensity or photon <b>auto-correlation</b> <b>function</b> (also known as photon correlation spectroscopy or quasi-elastic {{light scattering}}). In the time domain analysis, the autocorrelation function (ACF) usually decays starting from zero delay time, and faster dynamics due to smaller particles lead to faster decorrelation of scattered intensity trace. It has been shown that the intensity ACF is the Fourier transformation of the power spectrum, and therefore the DLS measurements can be equally well performed in the spectral domain. DLS can also be used to probe the behavior of complex fluids such as concentrated polymer solutions.|$|E

5000|$|The Autoregressive {{model is}} {{one of a group of}} linear {{prediction}} formulas that attempt to predict an output y_n of a system based on previous set of outputs {y_k} where k < n and inputs x_n and {x_k} where k < n. There exist minor changes in the way the predictions are computed based on which, several variations of the model are developed. Basically, when the model depends only on the previous outputs of the system, it is referred to as an auto-regressive model. It is referred to as a Moving Average Model (MAM), if it depends on only the inputs to the system. Finally, Autoregressive-Moving Average models are those that depend both on the inputs and the outputs, for prediction of current output. Autoregressive model of order p, denoted as AR(p), has the following form:Xt = R1 Xt-1 + R2 Xt-2 + ... + Rp Xt-p + Wtwhere Wt is the white noise, Ri are real numbers and Xt are prescribed correlated random numbers.

We notice that the time <b>auto-correlation</b> <b>function</b> {{of the electric}} micro-field C(t) increases when the ratio r_i/λ_T decreases. Furthermore, we note that C(t) decreases up to zero in small time. This indicates that the ratio r_i/λ_T is small when {{the correlation between the}} ions is very strong. Figure  4 shows the velocity <b>auto-correlation</b> <b>function</b> D(t) for different coupling parameters [...] and different ratios r_i/λ_T. As it is clear, D(t) increases when the ratio r_i/λ_T decreases. Here we note that the time <b>auto-correlation</b> <b>function</b> of the velocity D(t) decreases up to zero in a long time. This indicates that the ratio r_i/λ_T is small when the correlation between the ions is very strong. Therefore, the diffusion coefficient increases when the time <b>auto-correlation</b> <b>function</b> of the velocity D(t) is larger, because the diffusion coefficient D is equal to the integral of D(t) [see Green–Kubo formula (37)].|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of an infrared wireless system using direct sequence spread spectrum techniques in multipath channels depends {{very much on}} the partial correlation properties of the spreading sequences used. Ideally, a spreading sequence should have zero sidelobes in its periodic and aperiodic <b>auto-correlation</b> <b>functions</b> in order to eliminate multipath dispersion. Unfortunately, no such ideal sequence exists in the binary field. In this paper, a new spread spectrum based binary modulation scheme is proposed in which a set of complementary sequences is transmitted simultaneously such that the sum of their aperiodic <b>auto-correlation</b> and cross-correlation <b>functions</b> are impulsive or near impulsive.
