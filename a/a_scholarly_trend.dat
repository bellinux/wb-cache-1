5000|$|Historians {{have long}} portrayed the contest between Jefferson and Hamilton as iconic for the politics, {{political}} philosophy, economic policies and future {{direction of the}} United States. For example, in the 1920s Claude Bowers, a historian and Democrat, wrote a best-seller that pitted good versus evil in Jefferson and Hamilton: The Struggle for Democracy in America (1925). The Jeffersonian position—called Jeffersonian democracy—won out in 1800 and Hamilton's Federalism died out (except on the Supreme Court of John Marshall). The historian Sean Wilentz in 2010 identified <b>a</b> <b>scholarly</b> <b>trend</b> in Hamilton's favor: ...|$|E
50|$|The Czech lands, {{then also}} known as Lands of the Bohemian Crown, were largely subject to the Habsburgs {{from the end of}} the Thirty Years' War in 1648 until the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. There were invasions by the Turks early in the period, and by the Prussians in the next century. The Habsburgs {{consolidated}} their rule and under Maria Theresa (1740-1780) adopted enlightened absolutism, with distinct institutions of the Bohemian Kingdom absorbed into centralized structures. After the Napoleonic Wars and the establishment of the Austrian Empire, a Czech National Revival began as <b>a</b> <b>scholarly</b> <b>trend</b> among educated Czechs, led by figures such as František Palacký. Czech nationalism took a more politically active form during the 1848 revolution, and began to come into conflict not only with the Habsburgs but with emerging German nationalism.|$|E

"Challenges the almost universally accepted interpretation {{of the development of}} Augustine's theology Proposes a new thesis, arguing for a fundamental continuity in Augustine's belief and practice from the moment of his conversion, and so enhances <b>a</b> major <b>scholarly</b> debate Resists the general trend to begin reading Augustine with his Confessions (396) and argues for the importance of the works written in the decade before, immediately following his conversion Carol Harrison counters the assumption that Augustine of Hippo's (354 - 430) theology underwent a revolutionary transformation around the time he was consecrated Bishop in 396. Instead, she argues that there is a fundamental continuity in his thought and practice from the moment of his conversion in 386. The book thereby challenges the general <b>scholarly</b> <b>trend</b> to begin reading Augustine with his Confessions (396), which were begun ten years after his conversion, and refocuses attention on his earlier works, which undergird his whole theological system. ...|$|R
40|$|Newsletter. It is hard {{to believe}} that a decade has passed since the Newsletter, and the regular {{activities}} of the Centre, began. The first CSJR Newsletter in 2000 comprised some photocop-ies of typed pages that were stapled together. In 2003 we expanded the Newsletter to include more information about activities at the Centre and at partner institutions, and also research notes by young scholars and academic visitors of the Centre. That is when the first colour is-sue was produced. It was initially produced off-site, but by 2006 it was being created entirely in-house, designed by SOAS MA Japanese Religions alumna Janet Foster and printed by the SOAS Print Room. Today the Newsletter is distributed to more than 400 institutions and in-dividuals in Europe, Japan and North America with <b>a</b> <b>scholarly</b> interest in Japanese religions. I must confess that I was pleasantly surprised when a colleague told me that he actually uses it in his classes as a quick update on <b>scholarly</b> <b>trends</b> and findings. Through the years it has been a great experience to bring together people interested in Japanese religions, who have used the Newsletter as a means of communication to an audience larger than the CSJR itself. Undoubtedly the Newsletter would not have existed without the dedication of many contribu-tors who have put an extraordinary amount of time and energy into what its production in...|$|R
5000|$|While {{historians are}} not unanimous, Princeton scholar Sean Wilentz in 2010 {{identified}} <b>a</b> <b>scholarly</b> <b>trend</b> {{very much in}} Hamilton's favor: In recent years, Hamilton and his reputation have decidedly gained the initiative among scholars who portray him as the visionary architect of the modern liberal capitalist economy and of a dynamic federal government headed by an energetic executive. Jefferson and his allies, by contrast, have come across as naïve, dreamy idealists. At best according to many historians, the Jeffersonians were reactionary utopians who resisted the onrush of capitalist modernity in hopes of turning America into a yeoman farmers' arcadia. At worst, they were proslavery racists who wish to rid the West of Indians, expand the empire of slavery, and keep political power in local hands - all the better to expand the institution of slavery and protect slaveholders' rights to own human property.|$|E
40|$|Both {{decentralization}} {{of state}} law and cultural relativism have been fundamentally embedded in legal pluralism. As <b>a</b> <b>scholarly</b> <b>trend</b> {{in law and}} society, it has insightfully challenged the underpinnings of analytical positivist jurisprudence. Nevertheless, a theoretical concept of political power has significantly been missing in research on the plurality of legal practices in various jurisdictions. This Article aims to critically offer a theoretical concept of political power that takes legal decentralization and cultural relativism seriously and yet points to how and where we should look into political power, assuming that legal pluralism itself may be a strategy of elites and nation-states amid globalization. First, the Article explores the contributions of legal pluralism, and its limits, in intellectually revolting against analytical positivist jurisprudence. Second, it explicates why a concept of political power has been missing, and why such a concept is required for better comprehension of legal pluralism. Third, it calls for a look into three sites of political power in the praxis of legal pluralism: politics of identities, non-ruling communities, and neo-liberal globalization. Last, the Article constructs a concept of political-legal transformations that enables us to unveil political power {{in the context of}} de-centralized legal pluralities. Power is produced in, resides in and is generated in the dynamic interactions between nation-states, localities and global agents. Transformative relations along these dimensions allow the nation-state to forfeit some elements of power, both in economics and in law, but they also enable it to maintain some essential ingredients of political power that are often veiled in the rhetoric of globalized pluralism...|$|E
40|$|The Status of Reading in Early Modern English Literature" {{explores the}} social {{implications}} of print publication in England from the 1590 s to the 1630 s. Analyzing the fictional worlds of texts and their material forms, "The Status of Reading" pushes against <b>a</b> <b>scholarly</b> <b>trend</b> that emphasizes writers’ anxieties and fears about print publication. It claims instead that writers often invoked a popular reading public {{in opposition to}} the elite, rarefied world of aristocratic court circles. This reading public was tied to the needs and ideas of the writers who called it into being, and who used it strategically to explore their own cultural importance and the growing importance of people outside the ranks of the aristocracy as taste-makers. In invoking this reading public, writers developed new notions of status and claimed an alternate hierarchy of intellectual merit that existed in tension with the social hierarchy. Their works explore various ways people could achieve this new status: attaining an aristocratic title through proving one’s intelligence and wit; gaining cultural capital based on popularity; or asserting the unique value of cultural contributions made by people whose gender or social position were considered subordinate. The texts under consideration—Christopher Marlowe’s "Doctor Faustus;" William Shakespeare’s "Twelfth Night," "Macbeth," "Love’s Labour’s Lost," "As You Like It," and "Sonnets;" Aemilia Lanyer’s "Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum;" and Ben Jonson’s "The New Inn" and "Ode to Himself"—foreground multiple forms of publication to different readers. Each text stages fictional reading practices and the circulation of texts; moreover, its print manifestation addresses imagined readers to whom the text is marketed. Together, these texts challenge traditional hierarchical structures on two fronts: while exploring what it meant for readers to advance socially through reading well, they also suggest that a popular reading public, made of commoners, should be considered just as culturally valuable—or perhaps more culturally valuable—than smaller, socially elite communities of readers. In attending to the ways writers constructed and empowered a common reading public, "The Status of Reading" significantly expands our understanding of the social dynamics of reading in an age of increasing literacy and access to texts...|$|E
