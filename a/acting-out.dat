5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., <b>acting-out</b> disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents, as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E

I am concerned here with two other matters as well: first, how and why women's choice of women as passionate comrades, life partners, co-workers, lovers, tribe, has been crushed, invalidated, forced into hiding and disguise; and second, the virtual or total neglect of lesbian existence {{in a wide range}} of writings, including feminist scholarship.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the real self-image, ideal self-image, and self-image disparity of maltreated adolescents, both <b>acting-out</b> and nonacting-out, as compared to nonmaltreated adolescents. Participants included 58 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 with groups approximately matched for age, IQ, and mental age. The maltreated group consisted of children who had been neglected, physically abused, and/or psychologically abused. Children in both maltreated and nonmaltreated groups were classified as <b>acting-out</b> or nonacting-out based on reports of truancy, substance abuse, disrespect for authority, violent outbursts, and trouble within the legal system.

40|$|The {{researcher}} {{aimed to}} answer the following question: What are the perceptions of preadolescent children and educators with regard to the phenomenon of <b>acting-out</b> behaviour? The goal {{of the study was to}} explore the perceptions of educators and pre-adolescent children on the phenomenon of <b>acting-out</b> behaviour. Pre-adolescence and socio-economic problems were discussed and behavioural theories, behavioural difficulties and <b>acting-out</b> behaviour were explored. The population consisted of educators and grade 5 to grade 7 learners in the two participating schools. Ten educators and twenty learners in each grade were selected by means of stratified random sampling, to participate in the study. The survey design was utilised, as the researcher wished to explore perceptions of educators and pre-adolescent learners on the phenomenon of <b>acting-out</b> behaviour. The researcher formulated two questionnaires that were reader-friendly to both educators and learners respectively. The questionnaires focused on aspects of <b>acting-out</b> behaviour observed in the developmental level which is of concern to the study. Research results have indicated that <b>acting-out</b> behaviour is an ever-increasing phenomenon, even though the term “acting-out” is relatively unknown. The educators and learner respondents had very similar views on <b>acting-out</b> behaviour and the reasons for this negative behaviour displayed by children. It can therefore be concluded that <b>acting-out</b> behaviour is perceived as being very real in the lives of today’s children and is very often regarded as problematic behaviour and only addressed as such. Characteristics of actingout behaviour include lying, swearing, aggressiveness, hitting and kicking, badmouthing others, poor school marks, bullying and seeking attention. Parental conflict is the highest cause of emotional problems and consequently behavioural problems in children. The family system is also the most important system in the pre-adolescent’s life. Consequently it is recommended that families need to be considered as a key system in the development of <b>acting-out</b> behaviour, but most importantly also, as a key factor in dealing with such behaviour. Further research on, especially, intervention methods with regard to <b>acting-out</b> behaviour and socio-economic factors are recommended and emphasised.

The adolescents were categorized as either <b>acting-out</b> or nonacting-out on the basis of their score on the Child Behavior Checklist-Teacher's Report Form (Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1986), as well as on corroborated reports made by school administrators. Fifty-eight <b>acting-out</b> and 58 nonacting-out adolescents completed a questionnaire packet containing measures of self-efficacy, locus of control, self-mage, and goal choice. In addition, each adolescent was interviewed and administered a brief intelligence measure. With all demographic variables covaried, the primary findings of the study were that <b>acting-out</b> as compared to nonacting-out adolescents experienced more incidents of failure, displayed lower general self-efficacy scores, greater external loci of control, and chose goals that were vague or less specific. The negative experiences associated with behavioral problems, such as academic failure, apparently lower adolescents' self-beliefs and abilities to specify their goals. Despite their experiential differences, however, <b>acting-out</b> and nonacting-out adolescents displayed similar levels of social self-efficacy, real self-image, and ideal self-image, as well as similar goal setting abilities in areas other than goal specificity. All adolescents chose a comparable number of goals, as well as comparable levels of goal difficulty, goal commitment, and procedural knowledge.

All participants (n= 86) were randomly placed in either a seven-session BLLP program group (n= 56) or placed on a waitlist (n= 30) and offered the BLLP program following the completion of the posttest. The BLLP program is a widely used parenting program with limited data available as to the effectiveness of the program. The data that are available utilizes the Becoming a Love and Logic Parent Before and After Questionnaire. A measurement tool designed specifically to measure the BLLP program. This study utilized two measurement tools widely used to evaluate parenting programs, the Parenting Stress Index/Short Form (PSI/SF) and the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI), in hopes of providing data that can be compared to other parenting programs. Levels {{of parenting}} stress were measured with a widely used index, the PSI/SF. The PSI/SF provides a Total Stress (TS) score and scores from three scales measuring different aspects of parenting stress: Parental Distress (PD), Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction (P-CDI), and Difficult Child (DC). Child <b>acting-out</b> behavior was measured with the ECBI. The ECBI measures disruptive child behavior using two scales: Intensity scale and a Problem scale. The intensity scale provides information regarding the frequency of certain <b>acting-out</b> behaviors, and the problem scale provides information {{as to whether or not}} parents view that particular behavior as problematic. All participants were parents or caregivers of elementary school students from a large suburban school district near Kansas City, Missouri. The group was homogenous in nature and had higher income and education levels than the average for the district and state, making it difficult to generalize finding from the study. Due to time and space limitations and attrition, the sample size of the study was small (n= 86), which likely contributed to the outcome of the study.
