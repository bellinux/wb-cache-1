40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{relationships}} between clothing interest and body awareness, between clothing interest and selected demographic variables for college men and women, and between body awareness and selected demographic variables for college men and women. To assess these relationships two measures were used. Body awareness, the attention given by an individual to his or her body as compared to the total perceptual field, was measured by the Homonym Test developed by Paul F. Secord (1953). The Homonym Test is a word-association test consisting of 100 stimulus words administered orally. Seventy-five words are homonyms which have both bodily and non-bodily meaning; 25 words are neutral. Individual scores are obtained by summing responses which are based on the bodily meaning of the homonym. Clothing interest was defined as a feeling of intentness, concern, or curiosity about clothes—a motivational force affecting the clothing behavior of the individual (Gurel, 1974). Clothing interest was measured by the Clothing Interest Inventory revised from Schrank (1973). A Likert-type scale was used to assign values for each of the 20 items of the interest inventory. A Background Questionnaire was developed to <b>aid</b> <b>description</b> of the sample. Included on the questionnaire were: age, sex, marital status, self-reported physical health, college major, and year in college. Participants were solicited from introductory psychology courses. Participants in the study were young college men and women predominantly single, between the ages 18 and 20, and lower division students. Because of the limited sample, generalizations from the study are limited to students of similar age and background. Analysis of the data revealed that there were significant differences (beyond the. 01 level of probability) between men and women on scores obtained on the Clothing Interest Inventory and on scores obtained on the Homonym Test of body awareness. Women scored significantly higher than men on clothing interest and on body awareness. Analysis of the data indicated a significant relationship (beyond the. 01 level) between clothing interest scores for women and college major. Women majoring in Home Economics and Business had higher clothing interest scores than women majoring in Science, Liberal Arts, and Engineering. Analysis of the data indicated a significant relationship (beyond the. 05 level) between clothing interest scores of men and the Homonym Test of body awareness scores. The relationship between clothing interest scores of women and the Homonym Test of body awareness scores was not significant. It was concluded that sex differences are related to clothing interest and body awareness. It was concluded that the relationship between body awareness and clothing interest requires further investigation to understand more clearly why the relationship was significant for men but not for women. It was recommended that the relationship between demographic variables and clothing interest and body awareness be explored with a less homogeneous sample. A wider age range and wider range in class level is recommended...|$|E

40|$|Unexpected faults are {{a serious}} {{production}} problem in numerous, complex and compartmentalised {{oil and gas}} fields, and are often {{the single most important}} restraint on recovery. Fractal mathematics has demonstrated a surprising degree of order in many natural, apparently random systems. It has been shown that fault patterns exhibit a similar order which could be used to indicate the presence of structures missed in the original interpretation of the seismic data and to predict faults below the approximate 20 m limit of seismic resolution. The potential for greater clarity and resolution opened up by this method may greatly <b>aid</b> field <b>description</b> and reservoir production. We will discuss the development of a comprehensive fault pattern characterisation quantatively with a set of parameters arising from non-linear methods of analysis.
