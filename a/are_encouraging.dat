25|$|There {{have been}} public {{criticisms of the}} {{mechanisms}} and implementation of some security initiatives and grants, with claims they are being led by the same companies who can benefit, and that they <b>are</b> <b>encouraging</b> an unnecessary culture of fear. Commentators note that these initiatives started directly {{after the collapse of}} the Cold War, raising the concern that this was simply a diversion of the military-industrial complex away from a funding area which was shrinking and into a richer previously civilian arena.|$|E
25|$|The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 {{increases}} average {{gas mileage}} to 35 mpg by 2020. The current administration and 2007 legislation <b>are</b> <b>encouraging</b> the near-term use of plug-in electric cars, and hydrogen cars by 2020. Toyota {{has suggested that}} their third-generation 2009 Prius may cost {{much less than the}} current model. Larger advanced-technology batteries have been suggested to make it plug-in rechargeable. Photovoltaics are an option being discussed to extend its daytime electric driving range.

25|$|The {{extent of}} {{intellectual}} loss receded substantially over the 1990s and 2000s, with {{the percentage of}} students going abroad dropping from as high as 70% at one time to around 30% in 2005. This is largely attributed to the liberalization of the Indian economy and the opening of previously closed markets. Government initiatives <b>are</b> <b>encouraging</b> IIT students into entrepreneurship programs and are increasing foreign investment. Emerging scientific and manufacturing industries, and outsourcing of technical jobs from North America and Western Europe have created opportunities for aspiring graduates in India. Many undergraduates go abroad to pursue further studies, such as MS, MBA and PhD.|$|E
25|$|The {{invasive}} green crab, Carcinus maenas, {{can turn}} off top down control by facilitating {{the recovery of}} salt marsh ecosystems. In marshes that have experienced die-off via the trophic cascade initiated by recreational overfishing, purple marsh crabs, Sesarma reticulatum, can be evicted by the larger green crabs, which prey upon the purple crab. In this way, green crabs can indirectly reduce purple crab herbivory and promotes cordgrass recovery. These results <b>are</b> <b>encouraging</b> because they suggest that invasive species, which are classically considered to have mostly negative impacts on the ecosystems they invade, can sometimes actually contribute to restoring degraded ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|While islet {{transplantation}} {{research has}} made important progress {{and the success}} stories <b>are</b> <b>encouraging,</b> the long-term safety and efficacy of the procedure remain unclear. Other concerns {{relating to the field}} include questions about the impact of having insulin-producing foreign cells within the hepatic parenchyma, the long-term consequences of elevated portal pressures resulting from the islet infusion, and the fact that islet recipients can be sensitized against donor tissue types, making it more difficult to find a suitable donor should another life-saving transplant be required in the future. Also, very few islet transplant recipients have remained euglycemic without the use of any exogenous insulin beyond four years post-transplant. Thus, while most islet recipients achieve better glycemia control and suffer less serious hypoglycemia, islet transplantation continues to fall short of the definitive diabetes cure.|$|E

25|$|Since {{hedge funds}} are private {{entities}} and have few public disclosure requirements, this is sometimes {{perceived as a}} lack of transparency. Another common perception of hedge funds is that their managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight and/or registration requirements as other financial investment managers, and more prone to manager-specific idiosyncratic risks such as style drifts, faulty operations, or fraud. New regulations introduced in the US and the EU as of 2010 require hedge fund managers to report more information, leading to greater transparency. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, <b>are</b> <b>encouraging</b> further developments in hedge fund risk management, both through internal practices and external regulatory requirements. The increasing influence of institutional investors has led to greater transparency: hedge funds increasingly provide information to investors including valuation methodology, positions and leverage exposure.|$|E
25|$|During his governorship, Patrick {{oversaw the}} {{implementation}} of the state's 2006 health care reform program which had been enacted under Mitt Romney; increased funding to education and life sciences; won a federal Race to the Top education grant; passed an overhaul of governance of the state transportation function, signing a law to create the Massachusetts Department of Transportation; increased the state sales tax from 5% to 6.25%; and raised the state's minimum wage from $8 per hour to $11 per hour by 2017. Under Patrick, Massachusetts joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the planned introduction of casinos in Massachusetts. Patrick's second term began on January 6, 2011, and in an interview with The Boston Globe, Patrick declared he would not seek re-election in 2014. He is a managing director at Bain Capital and currently serves as {{the chairman of the board}} for Our Generation Speaks, a fellowship program and startup іnсubаtor whose mіѕѕіоn іѕ to bring together young Israeli and Palestinian leaders through entrepreneurship.

500|$|The {{results of}} this {{calculation}} <b>are</b> <b>encouraging,</b> but the masses of the up or down quarks were assumed to be 1/3 the mass of a nucleon. [...] The masses of the quarks are actually only about 1% that of a nucleon. [...] The discrepancy stems from {{the complexity of the}} Standard Model for nucleons, where most of their mass originates in the gluon fields, virtual particles, and their associated energy that are essential aspects of the strong force. [...] Furthermore, the complex system of quarks and gluons that constitute a neutron requires a relativistic treatment. [...] Nucleon magnetic moments have been successfully computed from first principles, requiring significant computing resources.|$|E

500|$|According to Dean Biron of Overland, [...] "Nightcrawler is a {{shattering}} {{critique of}} both modern-day media practice and consumer culture." [...] Throughout the film, Nina sensationalizes news headlines {{in an attempt}} to increase viewership. PopMatters Jon Lisi believes that, because of Nina's actions, the film specifically targets journalists who exaggerate headlines in order to combat a decline in viewership. Ed Rampell of The Progressive offers similar commentary, stating: [...] "Nightcrawler contends that ethnic and class biases are used to determine what is, and is not, deemed 'worthy' of news coverage. Local politics and related matters that actually affect viewers' lives get short shrift." [...] As much as the film indicts modern journalism, Nightcrawler director Dan Gilroy noted that his goal was for audiences to realize that by watching sensationalized news stories, they themselves <b>are</b> <b>encouraging</b> unethical journalism. Biron argues that Lou's character in the film is created because of consumer demand, and that he is a [...] "reflection of the symbiotic relationship between commercial imperatives and audience desire". Some critics argue that Nightcrawler {{is not so much a}} critique of journalism, but instead a depiction of Lou's entitlement.|$|E
