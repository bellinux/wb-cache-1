5|$|Horowitz {{points out}} that the film's {{dichotomy}} of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust. Author Jason Epstein commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E
25|$|Horowitz {{now lives}} in Central London with his wife Jill Green, whom he married in Hong Kong on 15 April 1988. Green {{produced}} Foyle's War, the series Horowitz wrote for ITV. They have two sons. He credits his family with much of his success in writing, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> they help him with ideas and research. He is a patron of child protection charity Kidscape.|$|E

Fascinated with dinosaurs {{since he was}} a kid (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> in the documentary) he flew himself to New York in his own plane to shoot on location at the American Museum of Natural History. Also, in 1985, DC Comics named Reeve as one of the honorees in the company's 50th-anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great for his work on the Superman film series.|$|E

25|$|Distinguished {{in figure}} and manners, Abelard was seen {{surrounded}} by crowds – {{it is said}} thousands of students – drawn from all countries by the fame of his teaching. Enriched by the offerings of his pupils, and entertained with universal admiration, he came, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> to think himself the only undefeated philosopher in the world. But a change in his fortunes was at hand. In his devotion to science, he had always lived a very regular life, enlivened only by philosophical debate: now, {{at the height of}} his fame, he encountered romance.|$|E
25|$|In {{the novels}} {{published}} by Pocket Books and set after Nemesis, Data returned in 2384 by having his memories and neural net transferred from B-4 {{into a new}} body which contained the memory engrams of Data's creator Doctor Noonian Soong after he was dying and being attacked by Lore years earlier. Data then takes control of the body after Soong deletes himself. After a tearful reunion with his old shipmates, Picard offers to reactivate Data's commission and to rejoin the crew but Data declines <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> he requires time. Several months later, {{with the help of}} the Enterprise crew, he is able to obtain the help necessary to resurrect his daughter, Lal.|$|E
25|$|An unusual species, Turritopsis dohrnii, {{formerly}} {{classified as}} T. nutricula, might be effectively immortal {{because of its}} ability under certain circumstances to transform from medusa back to the polyp stage, thereby escaping the death that typically awaits medusae post-reproduction if they have not otherwise been eaten by some other ocean organism. So far this reversal has been observed only in the laboratory. At least one professor at the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory at Kyoto University in Japan has concluded {{that there are three}} species of jellyfish that are immortal, and says their immortality may hold the key to immortality for human beings, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> that genetically they are not that much different from humans.|$|E

25|$|Just after Didi and Gogo {{have been}} {{particularly}} selfish and callous, the boy comes to say that Godot is not coming. The boy (or pair of boys) may be seen to represent meekness and hope before compassion is consciously excluded by an evolving personality and character, and in which case may be the youthful Pozzo and Lucky. Thus Godot is compassion and fails to arrive every day, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> he will. No-one is concerned that a boy is beaten. In this interpretation, there is the irony that only by changing their hearts to be compassionate can the characters fixed to the tree move on and cease {{to have to wait}} for Godot.|$|E
25|$|That you say as {{a theologian}} that I am a universalist is evident, {{in the sense}} that I believe that Jesus was sent into the world to save the sinners that we all are. This is what I {{understand}} Saint Paul to say when he mentions that sin has entered the world through one man, Adam, and spread to all men, and that he calls Jesus the second Adam through Whom redemption entered the world for all men, and even <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> 'all of creation,' that the redemption of Christ is the victory of God over the Fall. I believe that this great plan of salvation is universal, concerns not only all men but the universality of the world and that Jesus on the Cross has accomplished this Salvation, this reconciliation of men with God, that the 'chastisement' as Isaiah says is fallen upon Him to free men from the malediction of the Fall. This plan of God therefore seems to be collective, global, universal.|$|E
500|$|Spiegelman parodies the Nazis' {{vision of}} racial divisions; Vladek's racism is also put on display when he becomes upset that Françoise {{would pick up}} a black hitchhiker, a [...] "schwartser" [...] <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says.</b> [...] When she berates him, a victim of antisemitism, for his attitude, he replies, [...] "It's not even to compare, the schwartsers and the Jews!" [...] Spiegelman {{gradually}} deconstructs the animal metaphor throughout the book, especially in the second volume, showing where the lines cannot be drawn between races of humans.|$|E

500|$|Much of Longfellow's work is {{categorized}} as lyric poetry, but he experimented with many forms, including hexameter and free verse. His published poetry shows great versatility, using anapestic and trochaic forms, blank verse, heroic couplets, ballads, and sonnets. Typically, he would carefully consider {{the subject of}} his poetic ideas {{for a long time before}} deciding on the right metrical form for it. Much of his work is recognized for its melodious musicality. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "what a writer asks of his reader is not so much to like as to listen".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, in {{a wooded}} area, the two {{perpetrators}}, both wearing demon masks, {{face each other}} some twenty paces apart. One of the perpetrators raises his gun and shoots the other. At the mental institution, the two agents interview Josef Kobold (James Remar), the neighbouring patient of Richman. The answers Kobold gives are unsettling for the agents, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> {{that one of the}} perpetrators has killed again, showing them the location and warning them of [...] "something horrible" [...] happening there. After the dead perpetrator's body is recovered, Scully performs an autopsy and discovers that the body belongs to Gerlach.|$|E
500|$|Meeting with Deep Throat again, Deep Throat {{explains}} that Wilczek is being detained {{by the government}} at an undisclosed location. When Mulder asks if the COS survived, Deep Throat assures him the virus left no trace of it, and that scientists from the Defense Department have unsuccessfully examined the machine for any remaining signs of the program. At the Eurisko Building, Peterson directs a team attempting to recover the COS, but is told by his superiors to destroy the machine in six hours. Unbeknownst to Peterson, the COS comes back to life and watches <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> to himself, [...] "I'm going to figure this thing out if it kills me".|$|E

The video begins with a clip of the music video for [...] "You Only Live Once", and contains {{a reference to the}} song [...] "Last Nite". The reference occurs when Julian Casablancas throws his microphone stand (which he also did in the video for [...] "Last Nite") <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "everybody's singing the same song for 10 years".|$|R

500|$|Tobin {{experimented with}} various instruments. He {{does not come}} from a music family, nor has he had any formal {{training}} in music theory. About his music in general, Tobin says that he sees it as a [...] "genuine" [...] expression of the time he lives in, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> that by contrast, blues, jazz, and Brazilian genres were [...] "genuine" [...] expressions of the 1960s. Despite his indirect connection with Brazilian genres, Tobin collaborated with a number of artists on Bebel Gilberto's 2000 bossa nova album Tanto Tempo. Tobin's albums are often compared to soundtracks, and he says that movies by David Lynch have influenced him. In addition, he has stated to like films by the Coen brothers, Dario Argento, and Roman Polanski.|$|E
500|$|Later, Maxwell is dressed, and Hugo enters, {{wearing one}} of Shona's T-shirts. He says that Jorg is {{cleaning}} himself. Kath and Les talk; the former feels remorse, and insists they attend the dead man's funeral. Shona and Hugo leave the carriage; they intend to go [...] "exploring". Maxwell says his goodbyes to Kath and Les, then, alone, receives a call from his driver, who is waiting for him and Dr Meier. Maxwell turns to the body and says he is [...] "terribly sorry", but there can only be [...] "one candidate". <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> Meier's name, Jorg, now smartly dressed, answers. Jorg explains that he is Dr. Meier, {{and that he is}} travelling to an interview. As Jorg leaves the carriage, Maxwell looks at the corpse in silence.|$|E
500|$|The {{story begins}} at the court of Emperor Conrad, who {{for all of his}} good qualities has one defect: he refuses to get married, {{especially}} since, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> people no longer are as valiant and as noble as they used to be. His minstrel, Jouglet, tells him of Guillaume de Dole and his sister Liénor, and quickly the emperor falls in love with her, although he does not actually see her until the story's [...] Guillaume is summoned to the court where he excels in chivalric exploits; the emperor tells him he wishes to marry his sister. Conrad's jealous seneschal interferes and visits Guillaume's family, where he gives his mother a valuable ring and gains her confidence; from her he learns that Liénor has a particular birthmark {{in the shape of a}} rose on her thigh. This knowledge is presented as proof that the seneschal has taken her virginity.|$|E

500|$|To {{find out}} why the curse failed, the Queen turns to Rumpelstiltskin (Carlyle), the {{original}} owner of the curse. Rumpelstiltskin offers to help the Queen if, in turn, she makes him a wealthy and respected person {{in the new world}} and promises that she will do anything he asks so long <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> [...] "please." [...] The Queen agrees, reminding him that in the new world, they would have no recollection of their agreement. Rumpelstiltskin then tells the Queen that she must cut out the heart of the thing she loves the most and use it to complete the spell. The Queen protests that what she loved most died because of Snow White, but Rumpelstiltskin suggests that there is something else the Queen also loves. He also tells the Queen that he has informed Snow White and Prince Charming that their unborn daughter will be able to break the Queen's curse.|$|E
500|$|In Outliers, Gladwell {{interviews}} Gates, {{who says}} that unique access to a computer {{at a time when}} they were not commonplace helped him succeed. Without that access, Gladwell states that Gates would still be [...] "a highly intelligent, driven, charming person and a successful professional", but that he might not be worth US$50billion. Gladwell chooses his words carefully to never mention that Gates' mother was on the board of directors of IBM with access to the whole of IBM, and not just an ordinary daughter of wealthy businessmen <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says.</b> Gladwell explains that reaching the 10,000-Hour Rule, which he considers the key to success in any field, is simply a matter of practicing a specific task that can be accomplished with 20 hours of work a week for 10 years. He also notes that he himself took exactly 10 years to meet the 10,000-Hour Rule, during his brief tenure at The American Spectator and his more recent job at The Washington Post.|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Roberto González Echevarría {{argues that}} the {{dictator}} novel is “the most clearly indigenous thematic tradition in Latin American literature”, and traces {{the development of this}} theme from “as far back as Bernal Díaz del Castillo’s and Francisco López de Gómara’s accounts of Cortés’s conquest of Mexico.” [...] The nineteenth century saw significant literary reflections on political power, though on the whole the dictator novel is associated with the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. For critic Gerald Martin, the dictator novel marks the end of the Boom and even (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> of Roa Bastos's I, the Supreme) “the end of an entire era in Latin American history, the era which had stretched from Sarmiento's Facundo in 1845." [...] In the 1970s, many dictator novels focused on the figure “of the aging dictator, prey to the boredom of a limitless power he {{is on the verge of}} losing.” ...|$|E
