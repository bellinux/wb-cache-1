25|$|Western {{vegetarian}} diets {{are typically}} high in carotenoids, but relatively low in {{omega-3 fatty acids}} and vitamin B12. Vegans can have particularly low intake of vitamin B and calcium {{if they do not}} eat enough items such as collard greens, leafy greens, tempeh and tofu (soy). High levels of dietary fiber, folic acid, vitamins C and E, and magnesium, and low consumption of saturated fat are all considered to be beneficial aspects of a vegetarian diet. A well planned vegetarian diet will provide <b>all</b> <b>nutrients</b> in a meat-eater's diet to the same level for all stages of life.|$|E
25|$|Most {{reptiles}} lay amniotic eggs {{covered with}} leathery or calcareous shells. An amnion, chorion, and allantois are present during embryonic life. The eggshell (1) protects the crocodile embryo (11) and keeps it from drying out, {{but it is}} flexible to allow gas exchange. The chorion (6) aids in gas exchange between the {{inside and outside of}} the egg. It allows carbon dioxide to exit the egg and oxygen gas to enter the egg. The albumin (9) further protects the embryo and serves as a reservoir for water and protein. The allantois (8) is a sac that collects the metabolic waste produced by the embryo. The amniotic sac (10) contains amniotic fluid (12) which protects and cushions the embryo. The amnion (5) aids in osmoregulation and serves as a saltwater reservoir. The yolk sac (2) surrounding the yolk (3) contains protein and fat rich nutrients that are absorbed by the embryo via vessels (4) that allow the embryo to grow and metabolize. The air space (7) provides the embryo with oxygen while it is hatching. This ensures that the embryo will not suffocate while it is hatching. There are no larval stages of development. Viviparity and ovoviviparity have evolved in many extinct clades of reptiles and in squamates. In the latter group, many species, including all boas and most vipers, utilize this mode of reproduction. The degree of viviparity varies; some species simply retain the eggs until just before hatching, others provide maternal nourishment to supplement the yolk, and yet others lack any yolk and provide <b>all</b> <b>nutrients</b> via a structure similar to the mammalian placenta. The earliest documented case of viviparity in reptiles is the Early Permian mesosaurs, although some individuals or taxa in that clade may also have been oviparous because a putative isolated egg has also been found. Several groups of Mesozoic marine reptiles also exhibited viviparity, such as mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, and Sauropterygia, a group that include pachypleurosaurs and Plesiosauria.|$|E

ObjectiveWe used optimisation modelling {{to examine the}} dietary change required to achieve nutrient requirements at minimum cost for an Aboriginal population in remote Australia, using where possible minimally-processed whole foods. DesignA twelve month cross-section of population-level purchased food, food price and nutrient content data {{was used as the}} baseline. Relative amounts from 34 food group categories were varied to achieve specific energy and nutrient density goals at minimum cost while meeting model constraints intended to minimise deviation from the purchased diet. ResultsSimultaneous achievement of <b>all</b> <b>nutrient</b> goals was not feasible. The two most successful models (A & B) met <b>all</b> <b>nutrient</b> targets except sodium (146. 2 % and 148. 9 % of the respective target) and saturated fat (12. 0 % and 11. 7 % of energy). Model A was achieved with 3. 2 % lower cost than the baseline diet (which cost approximately AUD$ 13. 01 /person/day) and Model B at 7. 8 % lower cost but with a reduction in energy of 4. 4 %. Both models required very large reductions in sugar sweetened beverages (− 90 %) and refined cereals (− 90 %) and an approximate four-fold increase in vegetables, fruit, dairy foods, eggs, fish and seafood, and wholegrain cereals. ConclusionThis modelling approach suggested population level dietary recommendations at minimal cost based on the baseline purchased diet.

[...] These plans encourage producers to monitor <b>all</b> <b>nutrients</b> coming onto the farm as feed, forage, animals, fertilizer, etc. and <b>all</b> <b>nutrients</b> exiting the farm as product, crop, animals, manure, etc. For example, a precision approach to animal feeding results in less overfeeding of nutrients and a subsequent decrease in environmental excretion of nutrients, such as phosphorus.

2500|$|Essential {{genes are}} those genes of an {{organism}} that {{are thought to}} be critical for its survival. However, being essential is highly dependent on the circumstances in which an organism lives. For instance, a gene required to digest starch is only essential if starch is the only source of energy.

[...] Such experiments have led to the conclusion that the absolutely required number of genes for bacteria is on the order of about 250-300.

Most genes are not essential but convey selective advantages and increased fitness.|$|E

The stability of nutritional composition and physical traits of chicken patties containing oyster mushroom packed with biodegradable and non-degradable packaging materials were studied. The chicken patties containing oyster mushroom were packed with either biodegradable plastic (BP), paper box (PB) or non-biodegradable high density polyethylene (HDPE). Generally, {{there were no significant}} (P> 0. 05) different in <b>all</b> <b>nutrient</b> analyzed except for carbohydrate after 6 months of storage for chicken patties packed with different types of packaging.
