Consciousness and energy <b>are</b> <b>dependent</b> upon each other, since Shiva depends on Shakti, or energy, {{in order to}} fulfill his role in creation, preservation, and destruction.

5|$|Mycorrhizal {{symbiosis}} between {{plants and}} fungi {{is one of}} the most well-known plant–fungus associations and is of significant importance for plant growth and persistence in many ecosystems; over 90% of all plant species engage in mycorrhizal relationships with fungi and <b>are</b> <b>dependent</b> upon this relationship for survival.|$|E

5|$|Benefits Street is a British {{documentary}} series broadcast on Channel 4. It was first aired on 6 January 2014, {{and ran for}} five episodes. The show was filmed by documenting the lives of several residents of James Turner Street, Winson Green, Birmingham, England, United Kingdom, where newspapers including the Daily Mail and The Guardian reported that 90% of the residents claim benefits. It shows benefits claimants committing crimes, including a demonstration of how to shoplift, and portrays {{a situation in which}} people <b>are</b> <b>dependent</b> on welfare payments and lack the motivation to seek employment.|$|E

5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus envelop {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses <b>are</b> <b>dependent</b> on the envelope for their infectivity.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after hatching, turtles <b>are</b> <b>dependent</b> on {{egg yolk}} {{material}} for sustenance. About {{a week to}} {{a week and a}} half after emerging from their eggs (or the following spring if emergence is delayed), hatchlings begin feeding to support growth. The young turtles grow rapidly at first, sometimes doubling their size in the first year. Growth slows sharply at sexual maturity and may stop completely. Likely owing to differences of habitat and food by water body, growth rates often differ from population to population in the same area. Among the subspecies, the western painted turtles are the quickest growers.|$|E

5|$|Sound {{movement}} {{through the atmosphere}} is affected by wind shear, which can bend the wave front, causing sounds to be heard where they normally would not, or vice versa. Strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits tropical cyclone development, but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into living longer life cycles that can then produce severe weather. The thermal wind concept explains how differences in wind speed with height <b>are</b> <b>dependent</b> on horizontal temperature differences, and explains {{the existence of the}} jet stream.|$|E

40|$|Upward {{combustion}} of 316 {{stainless steel}} (SS) rods is discussed and a combustion model is presented. The effects of varying oxygen pressure and rod diameter on the rate limiting processes for combustion of 316 SS are evaluated. The rate-limiting steps for combustion up 316 SS rods are shown to <b>be</b> <b>dependent</b> on the incorporation and mass transport of {{oxygen in the}} molten mass, and heat transfer between the molten mass and rod.

40|$|Constitutive {{expression}} of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) has {{been implicated in}} several proliferative disorders. Constitutive {{expression of}} HIF 1 α and HIF 2 α {{has been linked to}} a number of human cancers, especially renal cell carcinoma (RCC), in which HIF 2 α expression is the more important contributor. Expression of HIF 1 α <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and is sensitive to rapamycin. In contrast, there have been no reports linking HIF 2 α expression with mTOR. mTOR exists in two complexes, mTORC 1 and mTORC 2, which are differentially sensitive to rapamycin. We report here that although there are clear differences in the sensitivity of HIF 1 α and HIF 2 α to rapamycin, both HIF 1 α and HIF 2 α expression <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> on mTOR. HIF 1 α expression <b>was</b> <b>dependent</b> on both Raptor (a constituent of mTORC 1) and Rictor (a constitutive of mTORC 2). In contrast, HIF 2 α <b>was</b> <b>dependent</b> only on the mTORC 2 constituent Rictor. These data indicate that although HIF 1 α <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> on both mTORC 1 and mTORC 2, HIF 2 α <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> only on mTORC 2. We also examined the dependence of HIFα expression on the mTORC 2 substrate Akt, which exists as three different isoforms, Akt 1, Akt 2, and Akt 3. Interestingly, the expression of HIF 2 α <b>was</b> <b>dependent</b> on Akt 2, whereas that of HIF 1 α <b>was</b> <b>dependent</b> on Akt 3. Because HIF 2 α is apparently more critical in RCC, this study underscores the importance of targeting mTORC 2 and perhaps Akt 2 signaling in RCC and other proliferative disorders in which HIF 2 α has been implicated...|$|R
