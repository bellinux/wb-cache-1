Cold storage is particularly useful for vegetables such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, radish, spinach, potatoes, and tomatoes, the optimum temperature {{depending on the}} type of produce. There are temperature-controlling technologies that do not require the use of electricity such as evaporative cooling. Storage of fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> <b>in</b> controlled atmospheres with high levels of carbon dioxide or high oxygen levels can inhibit microbial growth and extend storage life.|$|E

5|$|Further inland, the {{combination}} of strong winds and rains left heavy crop damage, destroying 3million bushels of corn and another million bushels of soybeans; losses to the corn crop were mitigated due to {{about half of the}} crop having been harvested before the storm's arrival. Heavy damage was also reported to the peanut crop as well as to various fruits <b>and</b> <b>vegetables.</b> <b>In</b> some locations, up to 15% of the cotton crop was lost, particularly in the northeastern portion of the state. In 45 counties in the eastern portion of the state, farmers affected by the hurricane were eligible for loans from the Farmers Home Administration, following federal approval from United States President Richard Nixon. Governor Robert W. Scott requested federal disaster aid for 24counties, which was denied. Damage in North Carolina was estimated at $10million (1971USD, $ USD), of which about $1million (1971USD, $ USD) was from coastal flooding. One death occurred in Washington when a vehicle accident was possibly caused by a wind gust; however, it was not conclusively linked to Ginger.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} Ottoman {{registers}} of the early Ottoman rule of Palestine, Bernard Lewis reports:he first half century of Ottoman rule brought {{a sharp increase in}} population. The towns grew rapidly, villages became larger and more numerous, and there was an extensive development of agriculture, industry, and trade. The two last were certamly helped to no small extent by the influx of Spanish and other Western Jews. From the mass of detail in the registers, it is possible to extract something like a general picture of the economic life of the country in that period. Out of a total population of about 300,000 souls, between a fifth and a quarter lived in the six towns of Jerusalem, Gaza, Safed, Nablus, Ramle, and Hebron. The remainder consisted mainly of peasants, living in villages of varying size, and engaged in agriculture. Their main food-crops were wheat and barley in that order, supplemented by leguminous pulses, olives, fruit, <b>and</b> <b>vegetables.</b> <b>In</b> and around most of the towns there was a considerable number of vineyards, orchards, and vegetable gardens.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century Plovdiv grew as a significant industrial and commercial center with well-developed light and food industry. In 1927 the electrification of Plovdiv has started. German, French and Belgian capital was invested in the city in development of modern trade, banking and industry.

25|$|Between the {{producing}} {{farmer in}} the countryside and the end-consumer in the cities there is a chain of intermediaries. Because a lack of information flows through them, farmers {{find it difficult to}} foresee the demand for different types of fruits <b>and</b> <b>vegetables.</b> <b>In</b> order to maximize their profits they, therefore, opt to produce those fruits and vegetables that created the highest revenues for farmers in the region in the previous year. If, however, most farmers do so, this causes the supply of fresh products to fluctuate substantially year on year. Relatively scarce products in one year are produced in excess the following year because like of expected higher profit margins. The resulting excess supply, however, forces farmers to reduce their prices and sell at a loss. The scarce, revenue creating products of one year become the over-abundant, loss-making products in the following, and vice versa.|$|E
