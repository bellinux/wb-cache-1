5|$|In 1872, Children of Israel {{purchased}} land on Adams Avenue, {{with the}} intent of building a new synagogue there, but financial pressures delayed the project, and in 1880 the congregation decided to sell the property and find <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>one.</b> They sold the lot in 1882, and instead purchased land on Poplar Avenue between Second and Third Streets. By 1884, they had completed a new synagogue building there, at a cost of $39,130 (today $). The Byzantine Revival structure had an impressive façade featuring twin tall spires and a large round window containing a Star of David. The building helped attract new members; by 1885 an additional 45 had joined, for a total of 173 member families, and the congregation was again debt-free. That year, the synagogue acquired a cemetery on Hernando Road.|$|E

25|$|Unger turns this {{question}} {{from one of}} general principles {{to one of the}} enactment of a vision or project of self-affirmation. For Unger, at issue here is not the pure speculation of philosophical inquiry into the nature of human beings and their activities, but rather a transformative project of self and society. In this way, the task is to realize a vision and enact a program of self-affirmation. The only alternative is to find <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>one</b> or fail at self-affirmation. The standards by which Unger confirms a project of self-affirmation are as follows: socially it is unstable if it fails to deal with behavior predispositions or material constraints, and existentially it fails if it disregards recurrent features of our experience, e.g. dependence upon others.|$|E
25|$|Some male {{behaviors}} {{that may have}} led to polyandry are displacement, where a male is gripped onto and mating with a female, another male may make an effort to mate as well and displace the male that was originally copulating; forced copulation, where there is a high density of aggressive males, and female abandonment, where a female but spots <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>one</b> to mate with and abandons the less favorable one. This can lead to sequential polyandry if the male leaves before the entire clutch is released and an additional male fertilizes these eggs as well. In Bibron's toadlet (Pseudophryne bibronii) females spread out their eggs across the nests of two to eight males, with those who exhibited higher levels of polyandrous behavior having higher mean offspring survivorship, showing that insurance against nest failure and dispersal of mortality risk is related to the evolution of polyandry.|$|E

25|$|Eating {{times are}} variable. Foraging trips can occur {{at any time}} and are very coordinated: either the entire colony forages or no one does. A small {{proportion}} of starved individuals is enough to reach agreement and start group movement. However, this organized behavior and the high fidelity of caterpillars to pheromone hormone trails imply conservative foraging, which may trap caterpillars to poor food sources even if <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>one</b> is close by. Some plasticity in this behavior has been reported, which is modulated by the presence of caterpillars that are behaviorally more exploratory or that simply become more adventurous because they are starved, increasing foraging flexibility. With age, competition for food becomes more important, especially as resources become scarce. Grouping decreases growth rate via a decrease in food intake so ontogenetic changes toward more mobility and independence can be viewed as simple “scaling” relationships between caterpillars and food sources evolved to increase the benefits of individual foraging in later stages.|$|E

500|$|In May 1961 Fleming {{sent his}} {{publisher}} the manuscripts {{for the first}} two volumes of Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang. To illustrate the book, Fleming suggested the Daily Mail cartoonist Trog—the pseudonym of Wally Fawkes—as he admired the artist's work.

Although Fawkes completed preliminary drawings for the project, the Daily Mail refused to allow him to complete the work as many of Fleming's works were serialised in its rival, the Daily Express.

After Trog was forced to withdraw from the project, Cape commissioned John Burningham, who had recently won the 1963 Kate Greenaway Medal for his book [...]|$|E

The score was not officially released until June 2010, when it was sold by La-La Land Records as a 3000-unit limited edition album. The album features 70 minutes of music across 14 tracks and, according to La-La Land, it also features a [...] "notable amount of music" [...] that was not used in the film, due to the constant re-edits prior to its release date. Daniel Schweiger of Film Music Magazine said that Mancina's score was [...] "arguably <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>one</b> than Speed", praising the album's [...] "thrilling themes", [...] "epic orchestrations", and [...] "Jamaican-style grooves".

500|$|Alkan's {{earliest}} works indicate, {{according to}} Smith, {{that in his}} early teens he [...] "was a formidable musician but as yet... industrious rather than... creative". Only with his 12 Caprices (Opp.12–13 and 15–16, 1837) did his compositions begin to attract serious critical attention. The op. 15 set, Souvenirs: Trois morceaux dans le genre pathétique, dedicated to Liszt, contains Le vent (The Wind), which was at one time the only piece by the composer to figure regularly in recitals. These works, however, did not meet {{with the approval of}} Robert Schumann, who wrote: [...] "One is startled by such false, such unnatural art... the last [...] a crabbed waste, overgrown with brush and weeds... nothing is to be found but black on black". Ronald Smith, however, finds in this latter work, which cites the Dies Irae theme also used by Berlioz, Liszt and others, foreshadowings of Maurice Ravel, Modest Mussorgsky and Charles Ives. Schumann did, however, respond positively to the pieces of Les mois (originally part published as Op.8 in 1838, later published as a complete set in 1840 as Op. 74): [...] " [...] we find such an excellent jest on operatic music in no.6 [...] that <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>one</b> could scarcely be imagined... The composer... well understands the rarer effects of his instrument." [...] Alkan's technical mastery of the keyboard was asserted by the publication in 1838 of the Trois grandes études (originally without opus number, later republished as Op.76), the first for the left hand alone, the second for the right hand alone, the third for both hands; and all of great difficulty, described by Smith as [...] "a peak of pianistic transcendentalism". This is perhaps the earliest example of writing for a single hand as [...] "an entity in its own right, capable of covering all registers of the piano, of rendering itself as accompanied soloist or polyphonist." ...|$|E
