The dramedy about cancer {{was based on an}} autobiographical script by screenwriter Will Reiser, and was released in September 2011. In mid-2010, Rogen shot scenes for another upcoming film, Take This Waltz, with Michelle Williams. Another of his movies, Paramount Pictures's road movie The Guilt Trip, also starring Barbra Streisand, was released in cinemas in 2012. The film was about an inventor (Rogen) who invites his mother (Streisand) on a road trip, as he attempts to sell his new product while also reuniting her with a lost love. In 2013, Rogen along with screenwriting collaborator Evan Goldberg made their directorial debut with This Is the End, a comedy movie featuring Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, and Danny McBride playing fictional versions of themselves facing a global apocalypse. The film received positive reviews and was number two in the box office on its opening weekend.|$|E
5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, <b>as</b> <b>produced</b> by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E

25|$|The {{oscillations}} {{depicted in}} the animation are exaggerated {{for the purpose of}} discussion — in reality a gravitational wave has a very small amplitude (as formulated in linearized gravity). However, they help illustrate the kind of oscillations associated with gravitational waves <b>as</b> <b>produced,</b> for example, by a pair of masses in a circular orbit. In this case the amplitude of the gravitational wave is constant, but its plane of polarization changes or rotates at twice the orbital rate and so the time-varying gravitational wave size (or 'periodic spacetime strain') exhibits a variation as shown in the animation. If the orbit of the masses is elliptical then the gravitational wave's amplitude also varies with time according to Einstein's quadrupole formula.|$|E
25|$|Pascal {{followed}} Pygmalion with Major Barbara (1941) {{which he}} directed as well <b>as</b> <b>produced.</b> Major Barbara was filmed in London during aerial bombing by the Nazis.

But Pascal {{became more and more}} extravagant, Caesar and Cleopatra (1945), the next Pascal film of a Shaw play, was the most expensive British movie ever at that time, and a big financial and critical flop. Pascal insisted on importing sand from Egypt to achieve the right cinematic colors for the film. Shaw had become more difficult to work with. After the success of Pygmalion, which was shortened in its transition from stage to screen, he increasingly refused to let his plays be cut.|$|E

500|$|A report {{commissioned}} by the United Nations, based on a detailed review of published research up to mid-2009 {{as well as the}} input of independent experts world-wide, found that ethanol from sugar cane <b>as</b> <b>produced</b> in Brazil [...] "in some circumstances does better than just “zero emission”. If grown and processed correctly, it has negative emission, pulling CO2 out of the atmosphere, rather than adding it. In contrast, the report found that U.S. use of maize for biofuel is less efficient, as sugarcane [...] can lead to emissions reductions of between 70% and well over 100% when substituted for gasoline. Several other studies have shown that sugarcane-based ethanol reduces greenhouse gases by 86 to 90% if there is no significant land use change.|$|E
500|$|It {{has also}} been argued that the {{methodology}} used by modern Egyptologists to translate ancient records is unreliable and unstable, and therefore produces flawed and nonsensical translations. Thus, the modern translations of the Joseph Smith Papyri <b>as</b> <b>produced</b> by Egyptologists {{are not to be}} trusted. This line of thinking was used by Nibley in his 1975 book, The Message of the Joseph Smith Papyri. He wrote: [...] "To the often asked question, 'Have the Joseph Smith Papyri been translated?' The answer is an emphatic no! What, then, is the foregoing? A mechanical transcription, no more [...] What we have is a transmission rather than a translation of the text [...] Though as correct and literal as we can make it, the translation in the preceding chapter is not a translation. It is nonsense." ...|$|E

500|$|Using {{his native}} English, Dassin wrote the {{screenplay}} to Rififi {{in six days}} {{with the help of}} screenwriter René Wheeler, who subsequently took the material and translated it to French. Dassin hated the novel; he was repelled by the story's racist theme in which the rival gangsters were dark Arabs and North Africans pitted against light-skinned Europeans. As well, the book portrayed disquieting events such as necrophilia—scenes that Dassin {{did not know how to}} bring to the big screen. For the rival gang, the producer suggested making them Americans, assuming Dassin would approve. Dassin was against this idea as he didn't want to be accused of taking oblique revenge on screen. Dassin downplayed the rival gangsters' ethnicity in his screenplay, simply electing the Germanic [...] "Grutter" [...] as surname. The greatest change from the book was the heist scene, which spanned but ten pages of the 250-page novel. Dassin focused his screenplay on it to get past other events he did not know what to do with. <b>As</b> <b>produced,</b> the scene takes a quarter of the film's running time and is shot with only natural sound, sans spoken words or music.|$|E
500|$|There {{are some}} {{theoretical}} indications that other nitrogen oligomers and polymers may be possible. If {{they could be}} synthesised, they may have potential applications as materials with a very high energy density, {{that could be used}} as powerful propellants or explosives. This is because they should all decompose to dinitrogen, whose N≡N triple bond (bond energy 946kJ⋅mol−1) is much stronger than those of the N=N double bond (418kJ⋅mol−1) or the N–N single bond (160kJ⋅mol−1): indeed, the triple bond has more than thrice the energy of the single bond. (The opposite is true for the heavier pnictogens, which prefer polyatomic allotropes.) A great disadvantage is that most neutral polynitrogens are not expected to have a large barrier towards decomposition, and that the few exceptions would be even more challenging to synthesise than the long-sought but still unknown tetrahedrane. This stands in contrast to the well-characterised cationic and anionic polynitrogens azide (...) , pentazenium (...) , and pentazolide (cyclic aromatic [...] ).
