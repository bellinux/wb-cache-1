Despite this, Australia's batsmen set a world record by chasing down 404 on the final day to win by seven wickets and take a series-winning 3–0 lead.|$|E

5|$|Ramsey was {{replaced}} by Jackie Milburn, under whose leadership fortunes on the pitch plummeted. Two years after winning the league title, Ipswich slipped down to the Second Division in 1964, conceding 121 league goals in 42 games – one of the worst-ever defensive records in English senior football. Milburn quit <b>after</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> full season and {{was replaced}} by Bill McGarry in 1964. The club remained in the Second Division for four years until McGarry guided Ipswich to promotion along with his assistant Sammy Chung in the 1967–68 season, winning the division by a single point ahead of Queens Park Rangers.

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Queen's in 1928, Wilfrid Eggleston began {{writing for the}} locally printed Lethbridge Herald. He wrote under Canadian Senator William Ashbury Buchanan, whom had {{acquired}} ownership of the newspaper in 1905. Eggleston held Buchanan and his politics in high regard during his short stay at the publication. <b>After</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> year writing in Lethbridge, he became Ottawa correspondent for the Toronto Star in 1929, and witnessed significant political events in this position, including {{the passing of the}} Statute of Westminster in 1931 and the British Empire Economic Conference of 1932. He also began writing through the media agency Reuters in the late 1920s by means of a syndicated weekly newspaper column, with a selection of his political pieces featuring in Time Magazine and a plethora of other noted publications. By the time Eggleston had resigned from the Toronto Star in 1936, he had risen to become the newspaper's parliamentary correspondent; he'd finished reporting through Reuters within the same year.|$|E

5|$|East of South Ann Street, both {{directions}} of NY167 overlap with NY5, following the four-lane road {{along the southern}} edge of downtown to a junction with East Main Street on the city's east side. NY167 reconnects with NY169 here, which leaves East Main Street to briefly follow NY5 and NY167 along the riverside arterial. The resulting overlap between NY167 and NY169 is a wrong-way concurrency, with NY169 southbound overlapping NY167 northbound and vice versa. NY169 splits from the highway <b>after</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> block to proceed south across the Mohawk River while NY5 and NY167 remain concurrent to {{the eastern edge of the}} city. Here, NY167 forks from NY5, running east as a two-lane street through the undeveloped eastern fringe of Little Falls. The highway rises in elevation as it heads out of the Mohawk River valley and passes into the adjacent town of Manheim.|$|E
5|$|Groza {{grew up in}} an {{athletic}} family in Martins Ferry, Ohio. He enrolled at Ohio State University on a scholarship in 1942, but <b>after</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> year in college, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and was sent to serve in World War II. Groza deployed as an army surgical technician in the Pacific theater, where he stayed until returning in 1946 to play for the Browns. Helped by Groza's kicking and play at offensive tackle, the Browns won the AAFC championship every year between 1946 and 1949, when the league disbanded and the Browns were absorbed by the more established NFL. Cleveland won the NFL championship in its first year in the league on a last-minute field goal by Groza. Groza set NFL records for field goals made in 1950, 1952 and 1953. Sporting News named him the league's Most Valuable Player in 1954, when the Browns won another championship. The team repeated as NFL champions in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In ODI cricket, Swann {{made his}} debut in January 2000 against South Africa, but off-field misdemeanours {{resulted}} in him being {{dropped from the}} team <b>after</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> match, {{and he did not}} play international cricket again until 2007. His solitary five-wicket haul in ODIs was against Australia in September 2009, a match England won by four wickets. Swann took five wickets for 28 runs in the match, and was given the man of the match award. He took 104 wickets in ODIs at an average of 27.76. Swann took 51 wickets in T20I cricket, but did not claim any five-wicket hauls; his best bowling figures in the format were three wickets for 13 runs. As of July 2015, his combined tally of 18 five-wicket hauls is twenty-seventh in the all-time list, a position he shares with Lance Gibbs.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} round of group matches during the 1979 Benson & Hedges Cup, a one-day cricket competition, Somerset County Cricket Club faced Worcestershire County Cricket Club at New Road, Worcester, on 24 May 1979. The result of the match would help to {{determine}} which teams progressed to the quarter-finals of the competition. If Somerset lost the match, and Glamorgan won their match, then Somerset, Worcestershire and Glamorgan would all be level on points, and bowling strike rate would be used as a tie-breaker. Brian Rose, Somerset's captain, realised that if he batted first and declared the innings closed <b>after</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> over, it would protect Somerset's strike rate advantage and guarantee them qualification. Somerset scored just one run from their over, and Worcestershire then took ten balls to score the two runs they needed to win. The match was completed in 18 minutes, and consisted of only 16 legal deliveries.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln City Football Club, an English {{association}} {{football club}} based in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, {{was founded in}} 1884, and first entered the FA Cup in the 1884–85 season. When nationally organised league football in England began, the club joined the Combination, a league set up to provide organised football for those clubs not {{invited to join the}} Football League which was to start the same year. When that league folded, Lincoln became founder members of the Midland League, and won the inaugural league title. They then spent a year in the Football Alliance before being elected to the newly formed Second Division of the Football League. Lincoln moved {{in and out of the}} Football League until they became founder members of the Football League Third Division North in 1921. They remained in the Football League until 1987, when they became the first club to suffer automatic relegation to the Football Conference. They returned to the League <b>after</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> season, remained at that level until they were again relegated in 2011, and returned once more in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Ramsey was {{replaced}} by Jackie Milburn, under whose leadership fortunes on the pitch declined.

Patrick Mark Cobbold, John's brother, joined the board of directors in 1964 and their mother, Lady Blanche Cobbold, became honorary president of the club. Milburn quit <b>after</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> full season and {{was replaced}} by Bill McGarry early in the 1964–65 season. The club remained in the Second Division for four years until McGarry guided Ipswich to promotion in the 1967–68 season, winning the division by a single point ahead of Queens Park Rangers.
