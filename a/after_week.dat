5|$|After {{some time}} away from TV, Ziggler {{returned}} on the August 22 edition of SmackDown Live to declare that he would undergo a gimmick change on the following week's edition. He later started mocking, week <b>after</b> <b>week,</b> the entrances of current and former wrestlers such as John Cena, Naomi, Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage. Ziggler believed that fans only cared about elaborated entrances, and not about the in-ring performances, where he claimed he was the best. However, after mocking The Undertaker's entrance, Ziggler was interrupted by Bobby Roode, who challenged Ziggler to a match at Hell in a Cell, which Ziggler accepted. At the event Ziggler, who had promised a never seen before entrance but ended up being an entrance with no music, lights and titantron, was defeated by Roode after a Roll Up; right after that, Ziggler attacked Roode from behind with a Zig Zag. On the October 17 edition of SmackDown Live, Ziggler defeated Roode in a rematch by a roll up, similar to how Roode defeated him. On 31st October's edition of Smackdown, Ziggler failed to earn a spot in Team Smackdown for Survivor Series 5 on 5 elimination match vs Raw after being defeated by Roode in a 2 out of 3 falls match and thus ending their feud.|$|E
5|$|Kolb {{attended}} Stephenville High School in Stephenville, Texas, {{where he}} was a three-year starter at quarterback. He moved on to the University of Houston where he earned Conference USA Offensive Most Valuable Player of the Year honors in 2006. Kolb started for two games in place of the injured Donovan McNabb during the 2009 NFL season for the Eagles, and earned NFC Player of the Week honors following his week 3 performance against the Kansas City Chiefs. Following McNabb's trade to the Washington Redskins in April 2010, Kolb became the starting quarterback for the Eagles. However, after suffering a concussion in week 1 against the Green Bay Packers, Kolb was replaced at quarterback by Michael Vick. Vick suffered a rib cartilage injury in week four and Kolb was named the starter. When Vick returned <b>after</b> <b>week</b> eight, Kolb was relegated to a backup role. Kolb was traded to the Arizona Cardinals {{prior to the start of}} the 2011 season. Kolb was released by the Cardinals on March 15, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Michaels then {{entered a}} feud with Randy Orton when Orton {{claimed that he}} could beat Michaels. The week before their {{scheduled}} match at Judgment Day, after Michaels won a match against Edge, Orton interfered, punting Michaels in the head. Orton assaulted Michaels again, just prior to their match at Judgment Day, interrupting Michaels' interview segment. Michaels collapsed {{during the course of}} their match, causing Orton to win by referee stoppage. Afterwards, Orton continued the beating, when he performed an RKO to a fallen Michaels. Michaels was then removed out of the ring in a stretcher. During the feud, Michaels conjured a storyline concussion. This injury was used to keep Michaels out of action, as he required surgery for his knee. Michaels made his return on the October 8 episode of Raw, performing a superkick to newly crowned WWE Champion, Randy Orton, during his title ceremony {{at the end of the}} show and then celebrating over the knocked-out champion as Vince McMahon watched. At Cyber Sunday, Michaels was voted by the fans to face Orton for the WWE Championship; though he won via disqualification when Orton hit Michaels with a low blow, which resulted in Orton retaining the championship. Michaels got another opportunity at the WWE Championship, when he was granted his rematch against Orton at Survivor Series. In their match, Michaels was banned from using Sweet Chin Music upon request by Orton, referring to as Michaels superkicking Orton week <b>after</b> <b>week.</b> Michaels lost the match, when Orton performed an RKO for the win which ended their feud.|$|E

40|$|The {{hormonal}} {{response of}} 32 older men (70 â€“ 80 years) to {{a bout of}} sub-maximum aerobic exercise was examined before, <b>after</b> 16 <b>weeks</b> of resistance or aerobic training and again <b>after</b> 4 <b>weeks</b> of detraining. Blood samples were obtained at rest and immediately post sub-maximum exercise (30 min @ 70 % VO 2 max) to determine the concentrations of growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), testosterone (Test), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and the calculation of free testosterone (FT). Both training groups had significant increases in leg strength and VO 2 max <b>after</b> 16 <b>weeks</b> training but leg strength and VO 2 max returned to pre-training levels in the aerobic training and resistance training groups, respectively. During the 20 week study there was no change in resting concentrations of any hormones among the three groups. There was no increase in GH, IGF- 1 or SHBG immediately post sub-maximum exercise {{in any of the}} groups before training, <b>after</b> 16 <b>weeks</b> training or <b>after</b> 4 <b>weeks</b> detraining. Testosterone and FT increased immediately post sub-maximum exercise within all groups before training, <b>after</b> 16 <b>weeks</b> training and <b>after</b> 4 <b>weeks</b> detraining with the increase in Test and FT higher <b>after</b> 16 <b>weeks</b> of resistance training compared to before training and <b>after</b> 4 <b>weeks</b> detraining within the resistance training group. The increased responsiveness of Test and FT <b>after</b> 16 <b>weeks</b> of resistance training was lost <b>after</b> 4 <b>weeks</b> of detraining. Our results indicate that some physiological and hormonal adaptations gained <b>after</b> 16 <b>weeks</b> training are lost <b>after</b> only 4 <b>weeks</b> detraining...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare mothers' and teachers' perceptions of the intellectual developmental level of preschool special education students after children were in a program for six <b>weeks</b> and again <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks.</b> Mothers' and teachers' perceptions were also compared to test scores both <b>after</b> six <b>weeks</b> and <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks.</b> Demographic variables considered for each hypothesis were child's age, sex, and sibling position, and mother's education, employment, and marital status. Perceptions were considered interview scores from the Developmental Profile II and test scores were those obtained from the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test [...] Revised. The data were analyzed by correlated t tests with p <. 05 to reject the null hypotheses. Mothers rated their children significantly higher than teachers rated them and higher than test scores both <b>after</b> six <b>weeks</b> and <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks.</b> Teachers' perceptions <b>after</b> six <b>weeks</b> did not differ from their perceptions <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks</b> or from test scores except for children 55 months and older, who had higher test scores than teacher ratings <b>after</b> six <b>weeks.</b> Boys were rated significantly higher by their mothers <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks</b> than <b>after</b> six <b>weeks.</b> Children from two-parent families were rated significantly higher by mothers than by teachers <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks</b> than <b>after</b> six <b>weeks.</b> High school educated mothers rated children sigificantly higher except in the first comparison to the test scores. Oldest children were rated higher by mothers than by teachers, and in the second comparison between mothers' scores and test scores. Children 54 months and younger were rated higher by their mothers <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks</b> than <b>after</b> six <b>weeks,</b> and in both comparisons of mothers' scores to test scores. Unemployed mothers rated their children higher <b>after</b> six <b>weeks</b> than teachers rated them, and employed mothers rated children higher <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks</b> than they did <b>after</b> six <b>weeks.</b> The author believes that further research, focusing on the relationships between parents' and teachers' perceptions is needed to provide guidance for increased cooperation between home in meeting the needs of young special education students...|$|R

25|$|The N type {{carriages}} {{were the}} first cars to be built at Newport Workshops in over 20 years. Each carriage took over 20 weeks to construct, with a rolling production line to give one new carriage {{off the assembly line}} every fortnight. Weeks 1 to 7 involved the general structure - welding the shell and the underframe together and attaching the ends. Following that, the electrical fitout took four weeks, and the bogies were fitted <b>after</b> <b>Week</b> 11. A mineral fibre insulation was sprayed on internal surfaces between weeks 12-14, and then the final six weeks the internal fibreglass ceiling and wall sheets were fitted, along with carpet, seats, lighting, doors and other components, with a one-week trial at the end. The cost was roughly $500,000 per carriage. The total build time added to 16,500 man-hours per carriage, against 32,000 for the earlier Z type carriages. Additionally, the carriages are between five and eight tonnes heavier than comparable designs overseas, partially due to their being a compromise between regional and commuter type vehicles. On the other hand, they cost a mere $13,000 per seat, against $47,000 per seat for the XPT carriages being built for New South Wales Railways around the same time.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all great}} artists, Licia's {{specific}} ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, {{lay in the}} fact that technique for this artist at least was always {{a means to an end}} and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week <b>after</b> <b>week,</b> year after year, inviting me to a place and places I had never been before. It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times.' As we all know, Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.|$|E
