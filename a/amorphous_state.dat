25|$|Charon's {{volume and}} mass allow {{calculation}} of its density, , {{from which it}} can be determined that Charon is slightly less dense than Pluto and thus contains {{a larger proportion of}} ice relative to rock in its interior. The difference is considerably lower than that of most suspected collisional satellites. Before New Horizons flyby, there were two conflicting theories about Charon's internal structure: some scientists thought Charon to be a differentiated body like Pluto, with a rocky core and an icy mantle, whereas others thought it would be uniform throughout. Evidence in support of the former position was found in 2007, when observations by the Gemini Observatory of patches of ammonia hydrates and water crystals on the surface of Charon suggested the presence of active cryogeysers. The fact that the ice was still in crystalline form suggested it had been deposited recently, because solar radiation would have degraded it to an <b>amorphous</b> <b>state</b> after roughly thirty thousand years.|$|E

Moreover, in the case of freshwater deposits of this kind it is certain that the action of percolating water may convert the originally soft and friable, fine-grained sandstone into a dense, semi-transparent opaline stone, the silicious organized skeletons being dissolved, and the silex re-deposited in an <b>amorphous</b> <b>state.</b> Whether such a metamorphosis as this occurs in submarine deposits, as well as in those formed in fresh water, does not appear; but there seems no reason to doubt that it may. And hence it may not be hazardous to conclude that very ordinary metamorphic agencies may convert these polar caps into a form of quartzite.|$|E

Chalcogenide {{is the same}} material used in re-writable optical media (such as CD-RW and DVD-RW).

Amorphization was caused when a Ta NC was the grain boundary, i. e., the orientations of the two regions adjacent to the contact boundary were different. The <b>amorphous</b> <b>states</b> transformed into crystalline states when the two regions were oriented along the same direction upon {{the application of the}} same pulsed voltage.

50|$|The unique {{characteristic}} that makes phase-change memory {{useful as a}} memory {{is the ability to}} effect a reversible phase change when heated or cooled, switching between stable amorphous and crystalline states. These alloys have high resistance in the <b>amorphous</b> <b>state</b> ‘0’ and are semimetals in the crystalline state ‘1’. In <b>amorphous</b> <b>state,</b> the atoms have short-range atomic order and low free electron density. The alloy also has high resistivity and activation energy. This distinguishes it from the crystalline state having low resistivity and activation energy, long-range atomic order and high free electron density. When used in phase-change memory, use of a short, high amplitude electric pulse such that the material reaches melting point and rapidly quenched changes the material from crystalline phase to amorphous phase is widely termed as RESET current and use of a relatively longer, low amplitude electric pulse such that the material reaches only the crystallization point and given time to crystallize allowing phase change from amorphous to crystalline is known as SET current.|$|E

40|$|In {{sufficiently}} high spatial dimensions, {{the formation}} of the amorphous (i. e. random) solid state of matter, e. g., upon sufficent crosslinking of a macromolecular fluid, involves particle localization and, concommitantly, the spontaneous breakdown of the (global, continuous) symmetry of translations. Correspondingly, the state supports Goldstone-type low energy, long wave-length fluctuations, the structure and implications of which are identified and explored from the perspective of an appropriate replica field theory. In terms of this replica perspective, the lost symmetry is that of relative translations of the replicas; common translations remain as intact symmetries, reflecting the statistical homogeneity of the <b>amorphous</b> solid <b>state.</b> What emerges is a picture of the Goldstone-type fluctuations of the <b>amorphous</b> solid <b>state</b> as shear deformations of an elastic medium, along with a derivation of the shear modulus and the elastic free energy of the state. The consequences of these fluctuations [...] which dominate deep inside the <b>amorphous</b> solid <b>state</b> [...] for the order parameter of the <b>amorphous</b> solid <b>state</b> are ascertained and interpreted in terms of their impact on the statistical distribution of localization lengths, a central diagnostic of the the state. The correlations of these order parameter fluctuations are also determined, and are shown to contain information concerning further diagnostics of the <b>amorphous</b> solid <b>state,</b> such as spatial correlations in the statistics of the localization characteristics. Special attention is paid to the properties of the <b>amorphous</b> solid <b>state</b> in two spatial dimensions, for which it is shown that Goldstone-type fluctuations destroy particle localization, the order parameter is driven to zero, and power-law order-parameter correlations hold.
