As time passes, however, Chris proves himself to be much braver than he appears. In fact, Chris single-handedly kills de Kere, the one man crazy enough to kill them all.|$|E

25|$|The {{business}} grew organically {{starting in}} 1990 {{with the first}} cassette tape. Connections were made when women in colleges started duplicating and sharing tapes. Offers to play at colleges started coming in and her popularity grew largely {{by word of mouth}} and through women's groups or organizations. Zango and Goldenrod, two music distributors specializing in women's music, started carrying DiFranco's music. In general they sold music to independent music stores and women's book stores. In 1995 Righteous Babe Records signed with Koch International for DiFranco's release of Not <b>a</b> <b>Pretty</b> <b>Girl.</b> Her records could then be found in large and small record stores alike.|$|E

[...] Over the years, DeBeck was credited with introducing more neologisms and catchphrases, such as [...] "heebie-jeebies", [...] "", [...] "balls of fire" [...] and [...] "time's a-wastin'". [...] In 1923, Billy Rose penned a Tin Pan Alley pop hit called [...] "Barney Google (with the Goo-Goo-Googly Eyes)".

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] {{are related to}} third-wave {{feminism}} and self-empowerment. It confronts society's standards and stereotypes with regard to female beauty. The song opens with a recorded snippet of a beauty pageant judge questioning Beyoncé on her life aspirations, to which she replies, [...] "My aspiration in life would be... to be happy". The sample is used to frame the song {{in the context of}} the singer's childhood. According to Michael Cragg from The Guardian, the snippets were used to question the singer's [...] "drive and desire that's got her to where she is today, and whether the struggle was entirely worth it". The song then transcends into a depiction of Beyoncé as a beauty pageant contest awaiting judgment in the lyrics, [...] "Mama said, 'You're <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>girl,</b> what's in your head, it doesn't matter. Brush your hair, fix your teeth. What you wear is all that matters". The second verse of [...] "Pretty Hurts"—"Blonder hair, flat chest/ TV says bigger is better/ South Beach, sugar free/ Vogue says thinner is better"—serve as an analysis of female body image and society's obsession with physical perfection.|$|E
500|$|Among {{his more}} curious and {{enduring}} innovations was the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. [...] The winter months, between the college bowl {{season and the}} start of Major League Baseball's spring training, was a slow time for sports journalism. [...] At the time, winter team sports like basketball and ice hockey were regional niche sports, and there was little to write about. [...] Laguerre had instituted an annual February issue titled [...] "Fun in the Sun", where he sent his staff to an exotic locale to write about and photograph it for his readers. [...] In 1964, he asked Jule Campbell, then a fashion reporter for Sports Illustrated, to [...] "go to some beautiful place and put <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>girl</b> on the cover" [...] of that year's [...] "Fun in the Sun" [...] issue. That year's issue featured only five pages of girls in swimsuits, and still predominantly featured travel writing, including articles about snorkeling and fish-watching. [...] With the help of that year's [...] "Fun in the Sun" [...] issue, 1964 became the first year that Sports Illustrated would turn a profit. [...] Though originally only planned as a one-off event, Laguerre was convinced by Sports Illustrated art director Dick Gangel to bring back the swimsuits in 1965, only [...] "a lot sexier". [...] Laguerre once again assigned Jule Campbell to scout models and locations. [...] The 1965 issue contained an article entitled [...] "The Nudity Cult" [...] and de-emphasized the travelogue-like writing of previous [...] "Fun in the Sun" [...] issues from which it evolved. [...] Since then, the Swimsuit Issue has become the biggest selling issue of the magazine, and a major cross-over publication for the fashion and modeling worlds as well.|$|E

They remain a mystery. I talked about this yesterday with a friend: do we focus on finding a person who fits with us, or will we remain single? I am open to both. If the right one comes – wonderful.

2500|$|Ani cites her anti-corporate ethos for {{the main}} reason she decided to start her own label. This has allowed her a {{considerable}} degree of creative freedom over the years, including, for example, providing all instrumentals and vocals and recording the album herself at her home on an analog 8-track reel to reel, and handling much of the artwork and packaging design for her 2004 album Educated Guess. She has referenced this independence from major labels in song more than once, including [...] "The Million You Never Made" [...] (Not <b>a</b> <b>Pretty</b> <b>Girl),</b> which discusses the act of turning down a lucrative contract, [...] "The Next Big Thing" [...] (Not So Soft), which describes an imagined meeting with a label head-hunter who evaluates the singer based on her looks, and [...] "Napoleon" [...] (Dilate), which sympathizes sarcastically with an unnamed friend who did sign with a label.|$|E
2500|$|Concerning the [...] "fruit streets" [...] in Brooklyn Heights [...] Cranberry, Orange and Pineapple Streets [...] the WPA Guide to New York City {{reports that}} before the Civil War, these streets, along with Poplar and Willow Streets, were named after {{prominent}} families, but that {{a member of the}} Middagh family expressed her dislike of these families by replacing the street signs with botanical names. [...] The city would restore the proper names, and Middagh would put back her own signs. [...] Several iterations of this game ended when Middagh's new names were given official status by a resolution of the alderman. In Historically Speaking, Brooklyn borough historian John B. Manbeck says only that these street names [...] "have questionable origins," [...] as does Love Lane, which reputably gets its name from the meetings that took place there between <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>girl</b> who lived nearby and her suitors.|$|E

She's a user, able to get almost anyone to do what she wants." [...] Kate Lock, author of EastEnders Who's Who, has described Sam as [...] "Headstrong, streetwise and pretty [...] a chip off the old Mitchell block, though her methods of manipulation are marginally more subtle than [...] One bat of a sooty eyelash is enough to charm most men into submission and she can wind doting mum Peggy round her little finger [...] she returned to the Square , Sam had lost her kittenish cuteness and hardened up, becoming more EastEnd moll than Barbie doll." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 7, 1937, Curly married Elaine Ackerman, {{who gave}} birth to their only child, Marilyn, the {{following}} year. The couple divorced in June 1940, after which he gained {{a lot of weight}} and developed hypertension. He was also insecure about his shaved head, believing it made him unappealing to women; he increasingly drank to excess and caroused to cope with his feelings of inferiority. He took to wearing a hat in public to convey an image of masculinity, saying he felt like a little kid with his hair shaved off, even though he was popular with women all his life. In fact, many who knew him said women were his main weakness. Moe's son-in-law Norman Maurer {{even went so far as}} to say he [...] "was a pushover for women. If <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>girl</b> went up to him and gave him a spiel, Curly would marry them. Then she would take his money and run off. It was the same when a real estate agent would come up and say 'I have a house for you'; Curly would sell his current home and buy another one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buñuel's {{films were}} {{famous for their}} surreal imagery, [...] {{including}} scenes in which chickens populate nightmares, women grow beards, and aspiring saints are desired by lascivious women. Even in the many movies he made for hire (rather than for his own creative reasons), such as Susana and The Great Madcap, he usually added his trademark of disturbing and surreal images. [...] Some critics {{have pointed out that}} one reason why Buñuel found working in Mexico so congenial was that what might seem unusual or even outlandish in Europe or the United States fit comfortably with elements of Mexican culture and the audience's expectations of national melodrama. [...] As filmmaker Tomás Pérez Turrent has commented, when referring to the apparently incredible features that many critics find in Buñuel's films: [...] "In Mexico, it's believable", while {{one of the founders of}} Surrealism, André Breton, called Mexico, [...] "the most surrealist country in the world." [...] Certainly, running through the more personal films of Buñuel's early and late years is a backbone of surrealism; [...] Buñuel's world is one in which an entire dinner party suddenly finds itself inexplicably unable to leave the room and go home, a bad dream hands a man a letter which he brings to the doctor the next day, and where the devil, if unable to tempt a saint with <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>girl,</b> will fly him to a disco. An example of a more Dada influence can be found in Cet obscur objet du désir, when Mathieu closes his eyes and has his valet spin him around and direct him to a map on the wall.|$|E

2500|$|Bo Duke (John Schneider) is the blond-haired, younger Duke boy (Wopat and Schneider {{are nine}} years apart from each other's age when Bo and Luke are {{supposed}} to be three years apart from each other's age). He is more of the [...] "shoot first, ask questions later" [...] type than Luke, and is often the one to get the duo into the various scrapes in which they find themselves, although the character did mature slightly as the series progressed; he is also the one more likely to have his eye, or heart, distracted by <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>girl.</b> Bo has a crush on many women in some episodes, which proves to be the Achilles' heel that leads the Dukes into trouble in several episode plots. Bo usually wears a cream-yellow shirt; it is a stronger yellow in the first and second season, a lighter cream color from the third season, and in the sixth and seventh season has more of a grey hue to it, in season 6 and season 7 he wears a tan brown shirt and more of dark blue jeans. (The only break from this norm is in the second episode produced and broadcast, [...] "Daisy's Song," [...] where Bo wears a red shirt for much of the story, and a sequence in the fifth episode, [...] "High Octane," [...] where he wears a light blue shirt. Many early publicity shots show the character to be wearing a dark blue denim shirt.) For the first two seasons he wears a blue T-shirt underneath (brown in the first episode); this was slowly phased out during the third season. An ex-stock car driver, Bo is the one who drives The General Lee most of the time with Luke riding shotgun. He and Luke take turns of driving the General Lee in some episodes as they share the car with each other (very early episodes suggest that it belongs solely to him; Luke is said to have a car that Cooter had wrecked shortly {{prior to the start of}} the opening episode, [...] "One Armed Bandits"). Bo is known for his rebel yell, [...] "Yeeeee-Haaa," [...] which he usually yells when the General Lee is airborne during a jump. The Duke boys share the CB call sign or handle [...] "Lost Sheep".|$|E
