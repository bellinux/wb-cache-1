Similar to results which were obtained for <b>absolute</b> <b>concentration,</b> relative concentration also increased between 1995 and 2009 for both variables. Yet, whereas <b>absolute</b> <b>concentration</b> was higher with regard to C&T-employment and was driven mainly by large countries such as China, relative concentration was more pronounced with regard to C&T-value added and was more influenced by countries with high shares in global C&T-value added such as Portugal or Turkey. As both <b>absolute</b> and relative <b>concentration</b> indexes with regard to both C&T-employment and C&T-value added increased significantly over time, it becomes evident that institutional changes and the reduction of transportation costs facilitated concentration as predicted in models of economic geography (Krugman 1991 a, b).|$|R

50|$|In {{biology and}} medicine, besides the more {{conventional}} uses described above, serial dilution {{may also be}} used to reduce the concentration of microscopic organisms or cells in a sample. As, for instance, the number and size of bacterial colonies that grow on an agar plate in a given time is concentration-dependent, and since many other diagnostic techniques involve physically counting the number of micro-organisms or cells on specials printed with grids (for comparing concentrations of two organisms or cell types in the sample) or wells of a given volume (for <b>absolute</b> <b>concentrations),</b> dilution can be useful for getting more manageable results.

Note that this construction causes the number of equivalents and therefore the mole percentage of each reagent/catalyst to differ between reactions. These experiments enable one to artificially [...] "enter" [...] the reaction at any point, as the initial concentrations of one experiment (the intercepting reaction) are chosen to map directly onto the anticipated concentrations at some intermediate time, t, in another (the parent reaction). One would expect the reaction progress, described by the rate vs. substrate concentration plots detailed above, to map directly onto each other from that interception point onward. This will hold true, however, only if {{the rate of the}} reaction is not altered by changes to the active substrate/catalyst concentration (such as by catalyst activation, catalyst deactivation, or product inhibition) before that interception.|$|E
50|$|In chemistry, {{reaction}} progress {{kinetic analysis}} (RPKA) is {{a subset of}} {{a broad range of}} kinetic techniques utilized to determine the rate laws of chemical reactions and to aid in elucidation of reaction mechanisms. While the concepts guiding reaction progress kinetic analysis are not new, the process was formalized by Professor Donna Blackmond (currently at Scripps Research Institute) in the late 1990s and has since seen increasingly widespread use. Unlike more common pseudo-first-order analysis, in which an overwhelming excess of one or more reagents is used relative to a species of interest, RPKA probes reactions at synthetically relevant conditions (i.e. with concentrations and reagent ratios resembling those used in the reaction when not exploring the rate law.) Generally, this analysis involves a system in which the concentrations of multiple reactants are changing measurably {{over the course of the}} reaction. As the mechanism can vary depending on the relative and <b>absolute</b> <b>concentrations</b> of the species involved, this approach obtains results that are much more representative of reaction behavior under commonly utilized conditions than do traditional tactics. Furthermore, information obtained by observation of the reaction over time may provide insight regarding unexpected behavior such as induction periods, catalyst deactivation, or changes in mechanism.|$|E

50|$|In {{order for}} a wound to heal, {{extracellular}} matrix not only needs to be laid down but also {{must be able to}} undergo degradation and remodeling to form a mature tissue with appropriate tensile strength. Proteases, namely matrix metalloproteinases are known to degrade almost all the extracellular matrix components. They are known to be involved in fibroblast and keratinocyte migration, tissue re-organization, inflammation and remodeling of the wounded tissue. Due to persistently high concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in diabetic ulcers, MMP activity is known to increase by 30 fold when compared to acute wound healing. MMP-2 and MMP-9 show sustained overexpression in chronic non-healing diabetic ulcers. Balance in the MMP activity is usually achieved by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP). Rather than <b>absolute</b> <b>concentrations</b> of either two, it is the ratio of MMP and TIMP that maintains the proteolytic balance and this ratio is found to be disturbed in diabetic ulcer. In spite of these findings, the exact mechanism responsible for increased MMP activity in diabetes is not known yet. One possible line of thought considers Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) as an active player. Most MMP genes have TGF-β inhibitory element in their promoter regions and thus TGF-β regulates the expression of both MMP and their inhibitor TIMP.In addition to the importance of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, all phases of wound healing are controlled by a wide variety of different growth factors and cytokines. To mention precisely, growth factors promote switching of early inflammatory phase to the granulation tissue formation. Decrease in growth factors responsible for tissue repair such as TGF-β is documented in diabetic wounds. Thus, reduced levels of TGFβ in diabetes cases lower down the effect of inhibitory regulatory effect on MMP genes and thus cause MMPs to over express.|$|E

Demyelination and axonal degeneration are a hallmark in multiple sclerosis (MS). OBJECTIVE: To define the extent of axonal degeneration in the NAWM in the remote from focal lesions in patients with relapsing-remitting (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 37 patients with clinical definite MS (27 with RRMS, 10 with SPMS) and 8 controls were included. We used 2 D (1) H-MR-chemical shift imaging (TR = 1500 ms, TE = 135 ms, nominal resolution 1 ccm) operating at 3 Tesla to assess the metabolic pattern in the fronto-parietal NAWM. Ratios of NAA to creatine (Cr) and choline (Cho) and <b>absolute</b> <b>concentrations</b> of the metabolites in the NAWM were measured in each voxel matching exclusively white matter on the anatomical T 2 weighted MR images. RESULTS: No significant difference of <b>absolute</b> <b>concentrations</b> for NAA, Cr and Cho or metabolite ratios were found between RRMS and controls.

The study cohort consists of 77 workers occupationally exposed to external gamma-rays at total dose from 0. 5 to 3. 0 Gy (14 individuals) and workers with combined exposure (external gamma-rays at total dose range 0. 7 - 5. 1 Gy and internal alpha-radiation from incorporated plutonium {{with a body}} burden of 0. 3 - 16. 4 kBq).

Relative concentrations of NKT-lymphocytes, concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta, interferon gamma, immunoglobulins A, immunoglobulins M and matrix proteinase- 9 were higher in this group as compared with control. Relative concentrations of T-lymphocytes and concentration of interleukin- 8 were decreased, while both the relative and <b>absolute</b> <b>concentration</b> of natural killers, concentration of immunoglobulins A and M and matrix proteinase- 9 were increased in workers with combined exposure as compared to control.

Here {{we look at the}} variance of MFI versus their ACV from the expression of 14 analytes in plasma, using 6 commercially available kits, across 177 patients, recorded at two time points and the associated analyte standards. In total 60 micro titre plates were used resulting in 4965 MFI. In doing so we develop a new background subtraction procedure that reduced by 50 % the number of out-of-range values observed in our data set. Using a linear mixed-effect model, which normalizes for assay-to-assay variation, MFI produced similar significant differences than that observed using <b>absolute</b> <b>concentration</b> values. We show that subtracting analyte blanks produces 15 % negative MFI resulting in uncertainty of the data being analysed. We argue for analysis of protein expression values MFI are generally a better choice than <b>absolute</b> <b>concentration</b> values. It is argued that analyte standards are not required on each plate, or not at all, in multi-plate experiments, but knowledge of the concentration curve and the range of MFI values that fall within the limits of this curve for each analyte is required.
