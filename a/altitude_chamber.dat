5|$|The Command and Service Modules were mated in the KSC <b>altitude</b> <b>chamber</b> in September, and {{combined}} system testing was performed. Altitude testing was performed first unmanned, then {{with both the}} prime and backup crews, from October 10 through December 30. During this testing, the Environmental Control Unit in the Command Module {{was found to have}} a design flaw, and was sent back to the manufacturer for design changes and rework. The returned ECU then leaked water/glycol coolant, and had to be returned a second time. Also during this time, a propellant tank in Service Module 017 had ruptured during testing at NAA, prompting the separation of the modules and removal from the chamber so the Service Module could be tested for signs of the tank problem. These tests were negative.|$|E

50|$|The rapid {{increase}} in volume and scope of experimental work on gasoline engines, particularly of aircraft engines, due to the impetus given by war conditions, intensified the need for suitable indicators and several laboratories undertook their development. The Bureau ofStandards was particularly interested in securing an indicator suited {{to use in the}} <b>altitude</b> <b>chambers</b> where aircraft engines are operated for purpose of test and analysis of their performance under reduced pressure and temperature simulating conditions of flight. The <b>altitude</b> <b>chambers</b> enclose only the engine, all controls and measuring apparatus being outside whence in addition to all other requirements, it was essential that any indicator adopted should possess the feature of remote controI and reading. For the purpose in hand, for general analysis of engine performance, accurate indicator cards are of more importance than are individual records of single cylinder cycles; therefore a point-to-point method can be employed.|$|R
500|$|Grissom, White, and Chaffee {{decided to}} name their flight Apollo 1 as a motivational {{focus on the}} first manned flight. They trained and {{conducted}} tests of their spacecraft at North American, and in the <b>altitude</b> <b>chamber</b> at the Kennedy Space Center. A [...] "plugs-out" [...] test was planned for January, which would simulate a launch countdown on LC-34 with the spacecraft transferring from pad-supplied to internal power.

500|$|Once all {{outstanding}} CSM-012 hardware {{problems were}} fixed, the reassembled spacecraft finally completed a successful <b>altitude</b> <b>chamber</b> test with Schirra's backup crew on December 30. According {{to the final}} report of the accident investigation board, [...] "At the post-test debriefing the backup flight crew expressed their satisfaction with the condition and performance of the spacecraft." [...] This would appear to contradict the account given in Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 by Jeffrey Kluger and astronaut James Lovell, that [...] "When the trio {{climbed out of the}} ship, … Schirra {{made it clear that he}} was not pleased with what he had seen," [...] and that he later warned Grissom and Shea that [...] "there's nothing wrong with this ship that I can point to, but it just makes me uncomfortable. Something about it just doesn't ring right," [...] and that Grissom should get out at the first sign of trouble.|$|E
2500|$|... 23 March 1961 was {{the tenth}} {{day of a}} 15-day {{endurance}} experiment in a low pressure <b>altitude</b> <b>chamber</b> at the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow. The chamber's atmosphere was at least 50% oxygen. Bondarenko, having completed work for the day, removed some monitoring biosensors from his body and washed his skin with an alcohol-soaked cotton ball, which he then carelessly threw away. The cotton ball landed on an electric hot plate which he was using to brew a cup of tea. The cotton ignited and Bondarenko tried to smother the flames with {{the sleeve of his}} woolen coveralls, which caught fire in the chamber's oxygen-rich atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|In a pressure-demand system, {{oxygen in}} the mask is above ambient pressure, {{permitting}} breathing above 40,000 ft. Because the pressure inside the mask {{is greater than the}} pressure around the user’s torso, inhalation is easy, but exhalation requires more effort. Aviators are trained in pressure-demand breathing in <b>altitude</b> <b>chambers.</b> Because they seal tightly, pressure-demand-type oxygen masks are also used in hyperbaric oxygen chambers and for oxygen breathing research projects with standard oxygen regulators.|$|R

50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the <b>altitude</b> <b>chamber</b> is for the {{subjects}} to learn what their hypoxia symptoms are. The symptoms of hypoxia are different for each individual, and this training is helpful for aviators to be able to recognize these symptoms during actual flight so as to avoid in-flight oxygen emergencies. Military pilots who fly aircraft at altitudes in excess of 10,000 feet, and civilian pilots who fly unpressurized aircraft above 12,500 feet, must use oxygen equipment. <b>Altitude</b> <b>chamber</b> training is required of U.S. military aviators every five years. The FAA and some larger airlines also require their pilots to periodically take <b>altitude</b> <b>chamber</b> training. Anyone with a pilot certificate in the United States who has a current Class I or Class II medical certificate can normally sign up and receive altitude training from several commercial facilities and a very limited availability from a government facility.|$|E
