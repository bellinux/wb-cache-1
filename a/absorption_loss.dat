[...] The high electron density in this layer lowers the refractive index {{in accordance with the}} Drude model. In this approach, the epitaxial structure is grown on an n-type InAs substrate and it also utilizes InAs for the separate confinement layers. For longer-wavelength operation, advantages include the much higher thermal conductivity of bulk InAs as compared to a short-period InAs/AlSb superlattice, as well as a much thinner cladding layer due its larger index contrast with the active region. This shortens the MBE growth time, and also further improves the thermal dissipation.

When this project started the <b>absorption</b> <b>losses</b> of the films were much higher. The aim of this work was the reduction of these <b>absorption</b> <b>losses.</b> The impurities in the films and the absorption caused by them could be reduced building a new- 2 -chamber-system for ion beam sputtering using ECR ion sources. Damage by a too high energy transfer to the films during deposition could be reduced by sputtering from partially oxygenized targets. The build up measuring systems for scatter and <b>absorption</b> <b>losses</b> reach a resolution limit of 10 "-" 6. For SiO_ 2 films an absorption value at 514 nm of 1 cm"-" 1 and for TiO_ 2 a value of 5 cm"-" 1 was achieved. A laser mirror made from these films has <b>absorption</b> <b>losses</b> of 30. 10 "-" 6. An AR-coating for 1064 nm is not damaged by 2 ms laser pulses with an intensity of 1 MW/cm" 2. Further reduction of absorption can probably be attained by lowering the energy transfer to the films.

50|$|When linearly {{polarized}} light is incident {{to a piece}} of weakly birefringent fiber, the polarization of the light will generally become elliptically polarized in the fiber. The orientation and ellipticity of the final light polarization is fully determined by the fiber length and its birefringence. However, if the intensity of the light is strong, the non-linear optical Kerr effect in the fiber must be considered, which introduces extra changes to the light polarization. As the polarization change introduced by the optical Kerr effect depends on the light intensity, if a polarizer is put behind the fiber, the light intensity transmission through the polarizer will become light intensity dependent. Through appropriately selecting the orientation of the polarizer or the length of the fiber, an artificial saturable absorber effect with ultra-fast response could then be achieved in such a system, where light of higher intensity experiences less <b>absorption</b> <b>loss</b> on the polarizer. The NPR technique makes use of this artificial saturable absorption to achieve the passive mode locking in a fiber laser. Once a mode-locked pulse is formed, the non-linearity of the fiber further shapes the pulse into an optical soliton and consequently the ultrashort soliton operation is obtained in the laser. Soliton operation is almost a generic feature of the fiber lasers mode-locked by this technique and has been intensively investigated.|$|E

Since lowering temperature reduces the <b>absorption</b> <b>loss</b> of the metal and increases the metal-loss-limited Q factor [23, 31], high-Q SPP modes can be obtained at low temperatures. The metal-loss-limited Q factor depends predominantly on the damping collision frequency, γ. The SPP mode’s Q factor increases exponentially with decreasing temperature due to the dramatic reduction of collision frequency. Even at 80 K, a high Q factor of[*]∼[*] 600 was obtained.

40|$|Carbon foams (CFoams) are sponge-like high {{performance}} lightweight engineering materials that possess excellent electrical and mechanical properties {{as well as}} thermal stability. CFoams possess bulk density {{in the range from}} 0. 30 to 0. 40 g cm(- 3) and open porosity of more than 70 %. The CFoam consists of pore walls, i. e., ligaments, which are responsible for the conduction path and hence the electrical conductivity due to mobile charge carrier (delocalized pi electron), are interconnected to each other. The high value of electrical conductivity causes the CFoam to act as an electromagnetic radiation reflector rather than an absorber; however, in certain applications, shielding materials must be able to absorb the maximum electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, to improve the absorptivity of electromagnetic radiation in lightweight CFoams, the CFoams are decorated by Fe 3 O 4 and ZnO nanoparticles. It is observed that coating with Fe 3 O 4 and Fe 3 O 4 -ZnO nanoparticles not only improved the <b>absorption</b> <b>losses</b> but also enhanced the compressive strength of CFoam by 100 %. This modified CFoam demonstrated excellent shielding response in the frequency range from 8. 2 to 12. 4 GHz, in which the total shielding effectiveness (SE) was dominated by <b>absorption</b> <b>losses.</b> The total SE is - 45. 7 and - 48. 5 dB of Fe 3 O 4 and Fe 3 O 4 -ZnO-coated CFoam, respectively, and it is governed by <b>absorption</b> <b>losses</b> of - 34. 3 dB and - 41. 5 dB, respectively. Moreover, the <b>absorption</b> <b>losses</b> increased by 236 % in Fe 3 O 4 -coated CFoam and 281 % in Fe 3 O 4 -ZnO-coated CFoam without much enhancement in the bulk density.
