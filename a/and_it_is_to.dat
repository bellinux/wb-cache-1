5|$|It {{is mounted}} on a {{rectangular}} cast-iron column of two-tons weight that rests on the masonry pier. Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock that keeps the telescope turning westward just as fast as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E
25|$|Ahurani(s) are not {{included}} in any list of yazatas, nor do they/does she have a day-name dedication in the Zoroastrian calendar. This may be because in later Zoroastrianism Aredvi Sura Anahita dominates as divinity of the waters, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> her that the hymn to the waters (the Aban Yasht) is dedicated.|$|E

25|$|I am not {{interested}} to know whether Vivisection produces results that are profitable to the human race or doesn't....

25|$|The MDP is {{currently}} undergoing significant restructuring {{as part of}} the coalition government's post 2010 austerity measures, and the Strategic Defence and Security Review. Its budget was cut from £360 million to £180 million <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> lose 20% of its manpower and up to 50% of its stations by 2016. The new, smaller force will concentrate on high end tasks such as nuclear weapons security and mobile armed policing of the defence estate.|$|E

25|$|The {{space is}} crowded <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be {{expected}} that the wall spaces would be divided by pilasters of low projection. But Michelangelo has chosen to use paired columns, which, instead of standing out boldly from the wall, he has sunk deep into recesses within the wall itself. In San Lorenzo's church nearby, Brunelleschi used little scrolling console brackets to break the strongly horizontal line of the course above the arcade. Michelangelo has borrowed Brunelleschi’s motifs and stood each pair of sunken columns {{on a pair of}} twin console brackets. Pevsner says the “Laurenziana... reveals Mannerism in its most sublime architectural form”.|$|E
25|$|On 5 May 2015, the Jordanian {{contracting}} company Sadeen Group and the Government of Malta {{signed an agreement}} at Auberge de Castille for the former {{to set up a}} private educational institution called the American University of Malta (AUM). The university was planned to be set up in Spain, but Prime Minister of Malta Joseph Muscat persuaded the chairman of Sadeen, Hani Salah, to set it up in Malta. The university is to accommodate 4000 students, primarily from the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. It is to have colleges for engineering, arts, sciences, education and health. The project has an investment of over €115 million, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> create around 400 to 750 jobs. The project is to generate an increase of €48 to €85 million in economic growth.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} many {{improvements}} {{have been made}} in printing machines and many additions made to their already wonderful capacities. Chief amongst these are those embodied in the Intermittent and the Duplex machines. In the former any or all of the rollers may be moved out of contact with the cylinder at will, and at certain intervals. Such machines are used in the printing of shawls and sarries for the Indian market. Such goods require a wide border right across their width at varying distances sometimes every three yards, sometimes every nine yards <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> effect this, with rollers of ordinary dimensions, that intermittent machines are used. The body of the sarrie will be printed, say for six yards with eight rollers; these then drop away from the cloth and others, which have up to then been out of action, immediately fall into contact and print a border or crossbar, say one yard wide, across the piece; they then recede from the cloth and the first eight again return and print another six yards, and so on continually.|$|E

500|$|In response, Yeats {{delivered}} {{a series of}} speeches that attacked the [...] "quixotically impressive" [...] ambitions {{of the government and}} clergy, likening their campaign tactics to those of [...] "medieval Spain." [...] "Marriage is not to us a Sacrament, but, upon the other hand, the love of a man and woman, and the inseparable physical desire, are sacred. This conviction has come to us through ancient philosophy and modern literature, and it seems to us a most sacrilegious thing to persuade two people who hate each other... to live together, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> us no remedy to permit them to part if neither can re-marry." [...] The resulting debate has been described as one of Yeats's [...] "supreme public moments", and began his ideological move away from pluralism towards religious confrontation.|$|E
500|$|Stoddart himself outspoken about Modernism, and its {{contemporary}} {{failures and}} historical misunderstandings, without hesitation, {{makes clear that}} his work stems from a Modernism born in neo-classicism, [...] "And yet, after having said all this about Modernism, I consider myself a Modernist – but {{in the context of}} a vast application of the term extending miles beyond the pokey wee official area to which usually it is confined. For in truth there are really two kinds of Modernism to be uncovered in the space of the last two and a half centuries, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> the first and largest of these that I belong and to which, in my small way, I contribute. This is the Modernism that was born in neo-classicism and has, as its great central titan, the mighty Richard Wagner." ...|$|E
500|$|Achebe {{provided}} a [...] "blueprint" [...] for African writers of succeeding generations. In 1982, {{he was awarded}} an honorary degree from the University of Kent. At the ceremony, professor Robert Gibson said that the Nigerian writer [...] "is now revered as Master by the younger generation of African writers <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> him they regularly turn for counsel and inspiration." [...] Even outside of Africa, his impact resonates strongly in literary circles. Novelist Margaret Atwood called him [...] "a magical writer– {{one of the greatest}} of the twentieth century". Poet Maya Angelou lauded Things Fall Apart as a book wherein [...] "all readers meet their brothers, sisters, parents and friends and themselves along Nigerian roads". Nelson Mandela, recalling his time as a political prisoner, once referred to Achebe as a writer [...] "in whose company the prison walls fell down", and that his work Things Fall Apart inspired him to continue the struggle to end apartheid. Nobel laureate Toni Morrison has noted that Achebe's work inspired her to become a writer and [...] "sparked her love affair with African literature".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{remarkable}} feature {{was that}} its wingspan {{was less than}} the overall length. The wings were cambered on the {{leading and trailing edges}} with a flat middle section. This wing design proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very inefficient. Power was provided by a [...] Clerget 9Z nine-cylinder air cooled rotary engine <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> armed with two [...] Vickers machine guns.|$|R
