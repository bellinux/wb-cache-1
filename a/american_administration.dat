In response to Western complaints {{of human rights abuses}} in Iran he has stated that the <b>American</b> <b>administration</b> has committed many crimes and is therefore not fit to judge the Islamic Republic.|$|E
25|$|In 1804, Arkansas Post {{became a}} part of the United States {{as a result of the}} Louisiana Purchase from France.

The American settlers had remained in the separate village north of the post, although further American settlement began after purchase by the United States, and American buildings were built in the main part of the post alongside the French and Spanish ones. The post was guarded by Fort San Estevan, renamed Fort Madison by the new <b>American</b> <b>administration.</b> Fort Madison was in use until 1810 when it was abandoned due to erosion and flooding.|$|E

Capitalizing on practices developed during the <b>American</b> <b>administration,</b> canal operations are improving under Panamanian control. Canal Waters Time (CWT), the average time it takes a vessel to navigate the canal, including waiting time, is a key measure of efficiency; according to the ACP, since 2000, it has ranged between 20 and 30 hours. The accident rate has also not changed appreciably in the past decade, varying between 10 and 30 accidents each year from about 14,000 total annual transits. An official accident is one in which a formal investigation is requested and conducted.|$|E
500|$|The American {{industrialist}} John Munroe Longyear visited Spitsbergen as {{a tourist}} in 1901, where he met with an expedition prospecting for coal. He returned to Spitsbergen 1903, where he met Henrik B. Næss in Adventfjorden, who gave him samples and information on coal fields. Along with his associate Frederick Ayer, Longyear bought the Norwegian claims {{on the west side}} of Adventfjorden, and expanded the claims significantly the following year. In 1906, the Boston-based Arctic Coal Company, with Ayer and Longyear as the main shareholders, started mining in Mine 1a, after having built docks and housing. The company had <b>American</b> <b>administration,</b> but mostly Norwegian labourers, and named the town Longyear City. Coal was transported the [...] from the mine to the port using an aerial tramway. In 1913, the company started preliminary work to open Mine 2a.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the 1789 French Revolution, {{relations}} between the new French Republic and the <b>American</b> <b>administration</b> of President George Washington became strained. [...] In 1792, France and the rest of Europe went to war, a conflict in which Washington declared American neutrality. [...] However, both France and Great Britain, the major naval powers in the war, seized ships of neutral powers (including those of the United States) that traded with their enemies. [...] With the Jay Treaty, ratified in 1795, the United States reached an agreement on the matter with Britain that angered members of the Directory that governed France. [...] The French Navy consequently stepped up its efforts to interdict American trade with Britain. [...] By the time John Adams assumed the presidency in early 1797, the matter was reaching crisis proportions. [...] In March 1797, not long after assuming office, President Adams learned that Charles Cotesworth Pinckney had been refused as U. S. minister because of the escalating crisis, and that American merchant ships had been seized in the Caribbean. [...] Popular opinion in the United States on relations with France was divided along largely political lines: Federalists took a hard line, favoring a defensive buildup but not necessarily advocating war, while Republicans expressed solidarity with the Republican ideals of the French revolutionaries {{and did not want to}} be seen as cooperating with the Federalist Adams administration. Jefferson looked at the Federalists as monarchists who were linked to Britain and therefore hostile to American values.|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{opinions of}} the various American newspapers about Russian mission of the <b>American</b> Relief <b>Administration</b> (1921 – 1923). Analysis of the materials of the American press enables to conclude {{that some of the}} American newspapers assumed that the <b>American</b> Relief <b>Administration</b> might organize anti-soviet activity in Russia. Attitude to this depended on political position of certain newspaper. According to this article three points of view were represented in the American press. Communists were convinced that the <b>American</b> Relief <b>Administration</b> intended to organize anti-soviet activity in Russia. Most of the liberals preferred to show understanding of communists’ suspicion to motives of the <b>American</b> Relief <b>Administration.</b> Most of the anti-bolshevik authors regarded positively to possible «anti-soviet activity». But their interpretation of «anti-soviet activity» distinguished from communists’ interpretation. In their opinion food relief could be used by two ways. Some of anti-bolshevik authors considered food relief as instrument of pressure. Others supposed that food relief could be peculiar agitation against soviet system...|$|R
2500|$|After the {{creation}} of the U.S. dollar, the fledgling <b>American</b> <b>administration</b> of President George Washington turned its attention to monetary issues again in the early 1790s under the leadership of Alexander Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury at the time. Congress acted on Hamilton's recommendations in the Coinage Act of 1792, which established the dollar as the basic unit of account for the United States. The word dollar is derived from Low Saxon cognate of the High German Thaler. The most commonly circulated and readily available currency, used by common Americans, at this time, was the Spanish Peso, also known as the [...] "Spanish milled dollar", which was valued for its high silver content.|$|E

Defending his use of international law, in 2005 Kennedy told The New Yorker staff writer Jeffrey Toobin, [...] "Why should world opinion care that the <b>American</b> <b>Administration</b> wants to bring freedom to oppressed peoples?

2500|$|Under {{the terms}} of the ceasefire of March 1991, corroborated by the {{resolution}} 687 of the UN Security Council, a commission (UNSCOM) was established to assure the dismantling of the Iraqi missile program. They were only allowed to purchase or produce missiles with a range no longer than 150km. [...] At the end of the war, the Iraqi government declared it had only 61 Al-Hussein and other ballistic missiles in its arsenal. These weapons were destroyed under UNSCOM supervision. This process was completed by July 1991. The western powers were however suspicious that the Iraqi army may have hidden as many as 200 missiles. The Iraqis took advantage of the provisions of the ceasefire by developing two types of short-range ballistic missiles, the Ababil-100 and the Al-Samoud, which were in an experimental phase {{at the time of the}} Invasion of Iraq in 2003. These projects were part of the casus belli raised by the <b>American</b> <b>administration</b> against Saddam Hussein.|$|E

2500|$|In Mid-March, {{after the}} {{increasing}} disorder in Palestine and {{faced with the}} fear, later judged unfounded, of an Arab petrol embargo, the <b>American</b> <b>administration</b> announced the possible withdrawal of its support for the UN's partition plan and for the dispatching of an international force to guarantee its implementation. The US, instead, suggested that Palestine be put under UN supervision. On 1 April, the UN Security Council voted on the American proposal of a convocation of a special assembly intended to reconsider the Palestinian problem, a proposal for which the Soviets abstained from voting. This U-turn from the Americans caused concern and debate among Yishuv authorities, who could not, after the withdrawal of British troops, afford to face the Arab troops {{without the support of}} the USA. In this context, Elie Sasson, the director of the Arab section of Jewish Agency, and several other personalities, ended up convincing David Ben-Gurion and Golda Meyerson to advance a diplomatic initiative towards the Arabs. The job of negotiation was delegated to Joshua Palmon, who was prohibited from limiting the Haganah's liberty of action but was authorized to declare that 'the Jewish people were ready with a truce.' ...|$|E
