30|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} plants (WWTP) represent habitats of continuous change in chemical composition (Szczepanowski et al. 2008). In oil refineries, the wastewater influent differs daily {{in terms of}} concentrations and composition of pollutant compounds, including light fraction aliphatic and <b>aromatic</b> <b>petroleum</b> hydrocarbons, organochlorines originated from cooling liquids used in the industrial process (Stepnowski et al. 2002) and other compounds such as phenol, chlorides, sulphides, sodium hydroxide, ammonia and heavy metals (Braile 1979; Mariano 2001). Phenols and derivatives are prominent pollutants in these wastes. These compounds are widely used as raw materials in the petrochemical industry and in oil refineries, for example in the washing and conditioning of alkaline or acid products. The increasing presence of phenols in the environment represents a serious ecological problem due to toxicity hazard for living creatures, including micro-organisms (Ojumu et al. 2005; Barrios-Martinez et al. 2006). Besides, the presence of phenols reduces significantly the biological degradation of the other compounds.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe thyroid gland, and its {{associated}} endocrine hormones, is a growing area of interest in regulatory toxicology due to its important role in metabolism, growth and development. This report presents {{a review of the}} toxicology data on chemically complex <b>petroleum</b> <b>streams</b> for thyroid hormone effects. Toxicological summaries and studies from all available published and un-published sources were considered, drawing upon the European REACH regulatory submissions for 19 <b>petroleum</b> <b>streams,</b> with in depth review of 11 individual study reports and 31 published papers on related products or environmental settings. Findings relevant to thyroid pathology or thyroid hormone homeostasis were specifically sought, summarized, and discussed. A total of 349 studies of 28 -days or longer duration were considered in the review, including data on mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, humans, and fish. The thyroid was almost invariably not a target organ in these studies. Three rodent studies did find thyroid effects; one on a jet fuel product (JP- 8), and two studies on a heavy fuel oil product (F- 179). The JP- 8 product differs from other fuels due to the presence of additives, and the finding of reduced T 4 levels in mice in the study occurred at a dose that is above that expected to occur in environmental settings (e. g. 2000 mg/kg). The finding for F- 179 involved thyroid inflammation at 10 – 55 mg/kg that co-occurred with liver pathology in rats, indicating a possible secondary effect with questionable relevance to humans. In the few cases where findings did occur, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content was higher than in related substances, and, in support of one possible adverse outcome pathway, one in-vitro study reported reduced thyroid peroxidase (TPO) activity with exposure to some PAH compounds (pyrene, benzo(k) fluoranthene, and benzo(e) pyrene). However, it could not be determined from the data available for this review, whether these specific PAH compounds were substantially higher in the JP- 8 or F- 179 products than in studies in which thyroid effects were not observed. Thus, a few products may carry a weak potential to affect the thyroid at high doses in rodents, possibly through secondary effects on the rodent liver or possibly through a pathway involving the inhibition of TPO by specific members of the PAH family. Human epidemiology evidence found weak and inconsistent effects on the thyroid but without identification of specific chemicals involved. Two studies in petroleum workers, which found a lower rate of morbidity and mortality overall, reported a statistically significant increase in thyroid cancer, but the small number of cases could not exclude confounding variables as possible explanations for the statistical findings. Overall, the available data indicates a low potential for thyroid hormone effects from exposure to <b>petroleum</b> <b>streams,</b> especially when the aromatic content is low. Because regulatory studies for most chemicals do not include detailed thyroid function or receptor studies, it remains possible that subclinical effects on this system may exist that were not detectable using conventional pathology or hormone measurements...|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE: The {{identification}} of key acid metabolites ('signature' metabolites) has allowed significant improvements {{to be made}} in our understanding of the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons, in reservoir and in contaminated natural systems, such as aquifers and seawater. On this basis, anaerobic oxidation is now more widely accepted as one viable mechanism, for instance. However, {{identification of}} metabolites in the complex acid mixtures from petroleum degradation is challenging and would benefit from use of more highly resolving analytical methods. METHODS: Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC/TOFMS) with both nominal mass and accurate mass measurement was used to study the complex mixtures of aromatic acids (as methyl esters) in petroleum fractions. RESULTS: Numerous mono- and di-aromatic acid isomers were identified in a commercial naphthenic acids fraction from petroleum and in an acids fraction from a biodegraded petroleum. In many instances, compounds were identified by comparison of mass spectral and retention time data with those of authentic compounds. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of a variety of alkyl naphthalene carboxylic and alkanoic and alkyl tetralin carboxylic and alkanoic acids, plus identifications of a range of alkyl indane acids, provides further evidence for 'signature' metabolites of biodegradation of <b>aromatic</b> <b>petroleum</b> hydrocarbons.

These target compounds were used as a basis {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} diffusive ground-water samplers. The diffusive sampling devices consist of a polyethylene membrane capsule suspended in a flexible protective covering. They are filled with supermarket-grade distilled water, sealed, and suspended in the saturated zones of monitoring wells.

The devices were then removed and the water within the sampler was analyzed for VOCs by standard laboratory methods. In the field trials, data from laboratory analysis of the diffusive samples was compared with laboratory data from contemporaneous conventional bailing and sampling. The results demonstrate favorable comparison between the data sets. The diffusive samplers provide an inexpensive and accurate alternative to conventional bailing and sampling methods. The devices have been shown to be suitable for long-term ground-water quality monitoring of VOCs and may also be useful for site screening or other assessment programs...|$|R

The most volatile of the streams, sweetened naphtha, and the least volatile, vacuum residuum, were noncarcinogenic in both assays.

40|$|The global {{petroleum}} {{demand is}} projected to increase in the next decennia as oil is expected to remain {{the primary source of}} energy around the globe contributing to approximately 40 % of the total consumption. The production of high-quality fuels from crude oil involves physical separation steps but also catalytic processes to remove contaminants (hydrotreating), shift the boiling point (alkylation and hydrocracking) and increase fuel quality (isomerisation). In hydrotreating sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen and metal atoms are removed from the different <b>petroleum</b> <b>streams</b> and unsaturated hydrocarbons are hydrogenated. The main reasons for refineries to perform hydrotreating are of environmental and economic nature. Besides protection of downstream catalysts from poisoning by sulfur, stringent environmental legislation has been aimed at the reduction of sulfur oxide emissions from fuel combustion. The environmental regulations on transportation fuel quality and the diminishing supplies of lighter types of crude oil necessitate further improvement of hydrotreating processes. An important approach is then to further optimize the catalytic activity of hydrotreating catalysts. In spite of the substantial progress made in the fundamental understanding of the active phase morphology, the metal-support interaction and reaction mechanisms, many details about the nature and stability of the active sites have not yet been elucidated. One specific issue not widely addressed is the influence of the sulfidation pressure on the active phase in hydrotreating catalysts.

But as the placement of such systems would be remote, the design has been performed using the following criteria.

Six cases have been compared, differing in reforming and oxygen generation technology. The comparison has been made on both a technical and production economic premises.
