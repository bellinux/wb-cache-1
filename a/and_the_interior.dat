5|$|Henry's son, George Herbert, {{maintained}} the lease and his wife, Henrietta, constructed gravel-laid public {{walks around the}} castle, dug into the surrounding cliffs, and planted trees around the grounds to improve the castle's appearance. The castle walls and towers were given superficial repairs and tidied up, usually when parts threatened to collapse, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of the inner bailey levelled, costing considerable sums of money. The landscape also required expensive maintenance and repairs.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} had {{stained glass windows}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> was decorated with glazed bricks, similar to other public buildings of this era in the city, such as the Victoria Baths.

5|$|The castle {{had three}} tiers of {{artillery}} – the heaviest and longest range weapons occupying the upper levels, including the keep – {{with a total}} of 39 firing positions, and 31 gunloops in the basement for handguns should close defence be required. The embrasures in the walls were all widely splayed to provide the maximum possible space for the guns to operate and traverse, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of the castle was designed with vents to allow the smoke from its guns to escape.|$|E
5|$|Danebury was {{abandoned}} around 100BC, {{in common with}} the trend across Britain for hill forts to fall out of use around that time. Once again, the east gate was burnt down, although this time it was not replaced. Most of the inhabitants deserted Danebury, and groups of bodies were disposed of in charnel pits. The site continued in use, but on a much smaller scale than before. Buildings were left to decay <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of the fort became used for grazing. By the start of the 1st centuryAD, the settlement of Danebury was probably nothing more than a single farm.|$|E

5|$|During {{a renewed}} {{investigation}} of the crime in 2005, the Department of Justice exhumed Till's remains to conduct an autopsy and DNA analysis which confirmed the identification of his body. Till was reburied in a new casket later that year. In 2009, his original glass-topped casket was found, rusting in a dilapidated storage shed at the cemetery. The casket was discolored <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> fabric torn. It bore evidence that animals {{had been living in}} it, although its glass top was still intact. The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. acquired the casket a month later. According to director Lonnie Bunch III, it is an artifact with the potential to stop future visitors and make them think.|$|E
5|$|During the {{periodic}} renovations undertaken, the various ruling dynasties of the Islamic Caliphate constructed {{additions to the}} mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, facade, its minbar, minarets <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> structure. When the Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099, they used the mosque as a palace and the Dome of the Rock as a church, but its function as a mosque was restored after its recapture by Saladin in 1187. More renovations, repairs and additions were undertaken in the later centuries by the Ayyubids, Mamluks, Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council, and Jordan. Today, the Old City is under Israeli control, but the mosque remains under {{the administration of the}} Jordanian/Palestinian-led Islamic Waqf.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-1940s {{through the}} 1960s, the Triangle was the {{commercial}} and cultural heart of Jerusalem, with many upscale shops and restaurants operated by German-Jewish immigrant businessmen that appealed to an affluent clientele. Following the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 {{and the expansion of}} the city away from the downtown core, the commercial viability of the Triangle declined. The area was revitalized by the conversion of Ben Yehuda Street <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> streets of the Triangle to an open-air pedestrian mall in 1982. Over the next two decades, outdoor cafes and souvenir shops moved in, cementing the reputation of the Triangle as a popular shopping and entertainment venue for tourists and young Israelis.|$|E

5|$|In 1980 {{the fourth}} bell {{of the ring}} of six was recast, again by the Whitechapel Foundry. By the 1990s the {{internal}} design of the church was beginning to be considered impractical {{for the needs of}} the community, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> was remodelled to a design by Robert Potter, with the works carried out in 1999. The west gallery was restored to house the 1852 organ, together with a kitchen and toilet facility, and the north transept was converted into a vestry with a room above it. Underfloor heating was built below a new marble floor and the chancel step replaced by an ovoid raised marble dais. Meanwhile, Scott's pews were removed altogether and replaced by wooden chairs.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane in coastal Florida, it became apparent that well-constructed buildings with shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings. Buildings with well-constructed frames, and those made of steel, concrete, brick, or stone were largely immune to the winds, and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of the buildings. Coming {{on the heels of the}} 1926 Miami hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed, one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes.|$|E
5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of a cuticle, an epidermis and longitudinal and circular bands of muscle fibres. In some primitive species, each epidermal cell has a single cilium, a feature shared only by the gnathostomulans. The whole ventral surface of the animal may be ciliated or the cilia may be arranged in rows, patches or transverse bands. The cuticle is locally thickened in some gastrotrichs and forms scales, hooks and spines. There is no coelom (body cavity) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of the animal is filled with poorly differentiated connective tissue. In the macrodasyidans, Y-shaped cells, each containing a vacuole, surround the gut and may function as a hydrostatic skeleton.|$|E

5|$|The last Texian {{group to}} remain in the open were Crockett and his men, {{defending}} the low wall in front of the church. Unable to reload, they used their rifles as clubs and fought with knives. After a volley of fire and a wave of Mexican bayonets, the few remaining Texians in this group fell back towards the church. The Mexican army now controlled all of the outer walls <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of the Alamo compound except for the church and rooms along the east and west walls. Mexican soldiers turned their attention to a Texian flag waving from the roof of one building. Four Mexicans were killed before the flag of Mexico was raised in that location.|$|E
5|$|The latter, at the {{southwest}} corner of Southwest Third Avenue and Washington Street, is eight stories high, was built entirely of Oregon materials, and cost $300,000 in 1892 dollars. The first three stories of the Romanesque structure are of rough-cut sandstone; the top five floors are of red brick and unglazed terracotta with floral designs. Decorative machicolations (openings of the sort used in earlier eras for pouring pitch and dropping rocks on attackers) appear in the parapet {{at the top of the}} building. For eight years starting in 1893 Portland's government was headquartered in this structure, temporarily dubbed the Council Building. The exterior was renovated in 1987, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> opened to the nearby Hamilton Building in the 1990s. The Dekum Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and is part of the Skidmore/Old Town Historic District.|$|E
