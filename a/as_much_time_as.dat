Gravel, as with some of the other second-tier candidates, did not get <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> the leaders; during the June 2, 2007, New Hampshire debate, which lasted two hours, he was asked 10 questions and allowed to speak for five minutes and 37 seconds.|$|E
5|$|There is {{difficulty}} in labeling the trobairitz as either amateurs or professionals. The distinction {{between these two}} roles was complicated in the medieval era, since professionals were generally lower class, and amateurs had <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> professionals to devote to their craft. Joglaresse were lower class, professional composers far less respected than the trobairitz.|$|E

5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, he had gained a reputation among the others in the squadron as an experienced pilot and a capable section leader. He was well-liked among other pilots and the black stewards and support staff of the carrier. Brown did not socialize much with the other pilots, however, and was known to spend <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> possible visiting his wife. He was able to reveal his marriage following his commissioning.|$|E
5|$|Dirks and Ueda {{married in}} 2007. She {{initially}} also worked at D. E. Shaw Research, but stopped in 2010 {{to raise the}} first of two children. The couple settled in the Westchester County suburb of Chappaqua, New York. He rose early to commute to his job via Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line, and returned late but devoted <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> possible on evenings and weekends to his children.|$|E
5|$|During summer {{holidays}} {{with his family}} in Dublin he met {{and fell in love with}} Cherrie Matheson, a friend of one of his cousins and a member of the Plymouth Brethren. He proposed to her in 1895 and again the next year, but she turned him down on both occasions because of their differing views on religion. This rejection affected Synge greatly and reinforced his determination to spend <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> possible outside Ireland.|$|E
40|$|Modular exponentiation is {{the most}} {{expensive}} portion of Shor’s algorithm. We show {{that it is possible to}} reduce the number of quantum modular multiplications necessary by a factor of, at a cost of adding temporary storage space and associated machinery for a table of entries, and performing <b>times</b> <b>as</b> many classical modular multiplications. The storage space may be a quantum-addressable classical memory, or pure quantum memory. With classical computation <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>times</b> <b>as</b> fast as quantum computation, values of from 2 to 30 seem attractive; physically feasible values depend on the implementation of the memory...|$|R

50|$|All EOCs are {{administered}} school-wide throughout a week, ensuring no issues occur while students are signing into the program. This has happened, {{on the first}} instance of EOC testing in the 2010-11 school year during the Algebra I exam. The exams are taken on a computer, generally on a standard model for all students to guarantee fairness. It is compulsory that students complete the test in a single sitting, being provided with <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> is necessary. However, rare is the time that a student needs more than the two provided 80-minute sessions. All necessary and admitted tools are provided electronically through the service.|$|R
5|$|Compared {{with the}} rival MiG-29K, the Su-33's maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is 50% higher; fuel {{capacity}} {{is more than}} double, allowing it to fly 80% further at altitude (or 33% at sea level). The MiG-29K can spend <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> the Su-33 on station by using external fuel tanks, but this limits its ordnance capacity. The Su-33 can fly at speeds as low as 240km/h (149mph), in comparison the MiG-29K needs to maintain a minimum of 250km/h (155mph) for effective control. However, the MiG-29K carries more air-to-ground munitions than the Su-33. The Su-33 is more expensive and physically larger than the MiG-29K, limiting the numbers able to be deployed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only did}} Gibbons work {{to repair the}} damage to the company offices, he made it a {{priority}} to allow its staff to deal with their personal situations. He made staff members job descriptions more flexible, encouraging staff members to take the initiative to perform a wide range of tasks. A corporate day care system was established, allowing staff to bring their children to work. Staff members were allowed to take off <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> needed to reestablish themselves and corporate dress codes were relaxed. The company brought in counselors, insurance experts, tax consultants, child care advisers and construction companies to help the staff reorient themselves.

5|$|Rather {{than trying}} to release the game {{in tandem with the}} movie, Rare founders Tim and Chris Stamper made sure to give the {{developers}} <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> they needed to finish the game. GoldenEye 007 was developed through two and a half years, the first year of which was spent developing the engine and producing art assets. The game was released on a 96Mb cartridge on 25 August 1997, nearly two years after the film. Additionally, every cartridge of the game contains a fully functional ZX Spectrum emulator with ten Rare developed games. This function was originally made as an experimental side project by Rare staff and was deactivated in the final build of the game, but has since been unlocked through fan-made patches.|$|E

5|$|With only 4:25 {{remaining}} and a lead well in hand, Stanford {{began running}} down the clock by executing running plays, which keep the game clock running {{as long as the}} ball carrier is downed in the field of play. Three rushes gained Stanford 16yards, but the effectiveness of this strategy was undermined by a 15-yard personal foul penalty against Stanford that prevented the Cardinal from gaining a first down. Stanford also accepted a delay of game penalty in order to squeeze <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> possible from the clock before punting back to Virginia Tech. The final drive of the game began from the Tech 11-yard line with 2:10 remaining, and quarterback Taylor controlled the ball on all of its five plays. Taylor completed a five-yard pass to Coale, then ran for 18yards and a first down. He was then sacked for a 15-yard loss, but gained much of that back with an 11-yard run. On the game's final play, Taylor completed a 17-yard first-down pass to Wilson, who was tackled as the last second ticked off the clock and Stanford clinched a 40–12 victory.|$|E

50|$|The current {{situation}} {{in respect to}} the merchant tonnage has already been mentioned in the memorandum of 27 August and is laid out in further detail in the attachment. In all brevity the situation is as follows: The shipping rates have reached outrageous levels, often <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> ten <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> in peacetime for many important goods.

25|$|At a young age, Wetch became {{fascinated with}} gambling, {{so much so}} that his mother {{threatened}} to enter him in Gamblers Anonymous. He pitched coins, played cards, bet on sports, and even on pinball. His other gambling pursuits tapered off when he discovered a pool table at 13 while playing cards in a friend's basement. Wetch was soon hooked, spending <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> possible in a local pool room called the Rack & Cue, playing eight ball and nine ball for 20 cents a game or more. He earned free table time by recording high scores on the room's video games.|$|E
25|$|Steve Young came in {{to replace}} Montana on the next drive, and the 49ers tried to run <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> they could off the clock. On the second play off the drive Brent Jones got behind the Giants defense and Young hit him for a twenty-five-yard gain. Two plays later, Craig {{recorded}} a six-yard gain for the 49ers' first rushing first down of the day. On the very next play Erik Howard poked {{the ball out of}} Craig's arms as he hit the line and Taylor caught it out of the air, giving the Giants possession on the first turnover of the game.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to survival, the early colonists {{were expected to}} make a profit for the owners of the Virginia Company. Although the settlers were disappointed that gold did not wash up on the beach and gems did not grow in the trees, they realized there was great potential for wealth of other kinds in their new home. Early industries, such as glass manufacture, pitch and tar production for naval stores, and beer and wine making took advantage of natural resources and the land's fertility. From the outset settlers thought that the abundance of timber would be the primary leg of the economy, as Britain's forests had long been felled. The seemingly inexhaustible supply of cheap American timber was to be the primary enabler of England's (and then Britain's) rise to maritime (merchant and naval) supremacy. However, the settlers could not devote <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> the Virginia Company would have liked to developing commodity products for export. They were too busy trying to survive.|$|E

25|$|While Wert {{endured the}} humiliating {{situation}} in Mantua {{through the late}} 1560s, he kept his job: he was to remain at least nominally maestro di cappella in Mantua until 1592. The 1560s were productive years for Wert musically, as he produced his first four books of five-voice madrigals during this time, and his first book for four voices. The dedications are significant: one is to Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, Duke of Sessa, and in the dedicatory preface Wert thanks him {{for the opportunity to}} lead his choir. (Fernández de Córdoba was Governor of Milan from 1558 to 1560.) During the late 1560s Wert had several offers of employment elsewhere, but turned them down. The most significant came in Augsburg in 1566, where Wert's spectacular ability to improvise counterpoint engendered an offer to join the imperial court in Prague, serving Maximilian II, the Holy Roman Emperor. The next job offer he refused came from Parma the next year, the home of the Farnese family. However he became increasingly close to the Este court in Ferrara during the 1570s and 1580s, without actually becoming employed there. While the two courts were closely connected by marriage and mutual interchange of musicians, Ferrara was a place with a profoundly different outlook from Mantua: Ferrara was progressive, while Mantua was supportive of the Counter-Reformation; the progressive tendencies of Ferrara better fitted Wert's musical inclinations. Wert had a good time there; so much so that his employer in Mantua sent a strongly worded letter on 22 December 1584 demanding his immediate return to his post. Wert, however, {{had fallen in love with}} the widowed Tarquinia Molza, the most famous female singer and poet in Italy, who was a lady-in-waiting at the Este court, so he endeavored to spend <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> possible in Ferrara. This was the same year that Lucrezia, Wert's wife, died in prison in Novellara.|$|E
