In {{the case of}} rural females, only 6% had ever-attended any school and only 3% graduated from primary or higher levels. The primary net <b>attendance</b> <b>ratio</b> of school-going age children was 39%, with girls lower than boys (36% versus 41%). This indicates that 61% children were still out of school, which will either join late, or probably will never enroll. The total enrollment for middle classes up to December 2009 was 1,085 and total enrollment in secondary classes was only 595. One of the major reasons for low enrollment in secondary levels is non-availability of schools. Against 572 primary schools in the district, there are only 17 middle and 14 high schools.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To examine {{possible}} differential {{changes in}} outpatient referrals to orthopaedic clinics, attendances, and waiting times between fundholding and non-fundholding general practitioners. DESIGN [...] Observational controlled study of referrals by general practitioners to orthopaedic outpatients between April 1991 and March 1995. SETTING [...] District health authority in south-west England. SUBJECTS [...] 10 fundholding practices with 108, 300 registered patients; 22 control practices with 159, 900 registered patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Changes in age standardised referral and outpatient <b>attendance</b> <b>ratios</b> {{for the year}} before and the two years after achieving fundholder status; changes in outpatient waiting times. RESULTS [...] In the year before achieving fundholding status both groups were referring more patients than were being seen. Two years later, referral and <b>attendance</b> <b>ratios</b> had increased by 13 % and 36 % respectively for fundholders and 32 % and 59 % for controls, and both groups were referring fewer patients than were being seen. Attendances represented 112 % of referrals for fundholders and 104 % for controls. In 1991 - 2, a similar proportion of patients {{in the two groups}} was seen within three months of referral. The two hospitals that set up specific clinics exclusively for fundholders showed faster access for patients of fundholders by 1993 - 4, as did a third hospital without such clinics by 1994 - 5. CONCLUSIONS [...] Fundholders increased their orthopaedic referrals less than did controls and achieved a better balance between outpatient appointments and referrals. Their patients were likely to be seen more quickly, particularly if the hospital provided special clinics exclusively for fundholders. Lack of case mix information makes it impossible to judge whether these differences benefit or disadvantage patients...|$|R

The postgraduate course Project Work and Communication in Research and Development (R&D) was developed at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of the University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia. The main aim of the course was to make the entry of young engineering graduates into the business environment as easy as possible. Currently, engineers are facing more and more interdisciplinarity and project work in their daily assignments. The course was designed to remedy any deficiencies in the multidisciplinary professional skills and knowledge of the graduate-level students, and it covered the topics of innovation management, communication in R&D, project management, and problem solving in teams. An end-of-course survey showed positive feedback from participating students. The empirical data (enrollment ratio of students, session <b>attendance</b> <b>ratio,</b> and average student grade) proves that the course met its goal of honing the professional skills of postgraduate engineering students...|$|E
40|$|After the {{collapse}} of the shōgun’s régime, Japan {{from the beginning of the}} Meiji Restoration (1868) had to cope with many tasks in order to carry out a process of modernization of the Country. One of the most demanding reform was the implementation of a new, and centralized, education system, within which the teaching of a standardized “national” language was one of the pillars of the new school organization. The need to pave the way to the development of a common medium of communication, shared on a national basis, inspired dialectological research, the production of new textbooks, a national language planning that meant, in some cases, discrimination against minority languages and dialects. Through a “trials and errors” process, between the end of the 19 th century and the beginning of the 20 th century, Japan succeeded in the creation of a “national language” ideology, and in developing a new school system that gained one the highest school <b>attendance</b> <b>ratio</b> in the world...|$|E

However, {{it is unclear}} to what extent FAs present transient episodes of care (TECs) compared with non-FAs. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of all episodes of care (ECs) in 15 116 consultations in 1 year. Reasons for encounter (RFEs) linked to patients' problem lists were defined as chronic ECs (CECs), other episodes as TECs. SETTING: 1 Dutch urban primary healthcare centre served by 5 GPs. PARTICIPANTS: All 5712 adult patients were enlisted between 2007 and 2009.

RESULTS: The average number of RFEs linked to TECs (non-FAs 1. 4; 3 yFAs 7. 3) and to CECs (non-FAs 0. 9; 3 yFAs 6. 2) increased substantially with the duration of frequent <b>attendance.</b> The <b>ratio</b> of TECs to all ECs differed little for FAs (52 - 54 %) and non-FAs (64 %).

AIM: To develop measures {{of variation in}} acute hospital use between populations enrolled at different general practices that are independent of the sociodemographic characteristics of those populations. METHODS: Two consecutive years of hospital discharge and ED attendance data were combined with primary health organisation (PHO) registers from 385 practices of over 1. 5 million people to develop and test two measures of unplanned hospital use: the standardised acute hospital admission ratio (SAAR) and the standardised ED <b>attendance</b> <b>ratio</b> (SEAR). Disease-specific measures were also produced for inpatient events. RESULTS: The enrolled populations of {{a high proportion of}} practices had significantly higher or lower than expected acute use of hospitals and this was consistent over both years studied. Practices whose population made unexpectedly high use of acute hospital care for one condition tended to do so for others. Differences in health needs between practice populations as measured by clinical complexity, comorbidities and length of stay did not explain {{a significant portion of the}} overall variation in hospital admissions. The enrolled population’s average travelling time to a 24 -hour ED accounted for some of the practice variation in unplanned utilisation of hospital services. DISCUSSION: This study confirms that there is considerable unexplained practice variation in acute hospital use. Further development of the SAAR and SEAR measures may be possible to use these to identify modifiable practice-level factors associated with high unplanned hospital use...|$|E

This study uses an emerging national ED data collection system to examine sociodemographics and temporal trends in child injury attendances in England. Methods Cross sectional examination of ED attendances for key injury types made by children aged 0 â�� 14 â��years between April 2010 and March 2011 (road traffic injury (RTI) n= 21 â�� 670; assault n= 9529; deliberate self harm (DSH) n= 3066; sports injury n= 88 â�� 250; burns n= 22 â�� 222; poisoning n= 12 â�� 446). Multivariate analyses examined the impact of demographics (age, gender, residential deprivation) and temporal events (day, month, school and public holidays) on risk of attendance for different injury types. Results For most injury types, attendance increased with deprivation. The <b>attendance</b> <b>ratio</b> between children from the poorest and richest deprivation quintiles was greatest for assaults (4. 21 : 1). Conversely, sports injury attendance decreased with deprivation. Males made more attendances than females for all but DSH. Age and temporal profiles varied by injury type. Assault attendances reduced at weekends while burns attendances increased. RTI and sports injury attendances were increased during school term times. Conclusions ED data can provide a major epidemiological resource for examining both temporal and demographic risks of child injury.

30|$|In Chile {{there was}} a massive {{investment}} in subsidized housing through which {{more than a million}} Chileans moved out of slum neighborhoods and become property owners (Salcedo 2011).

In addition, they found that although the program had significant positive effects on housing conditions (access to water, sewerage, and electricity), it had a negative effect on overcrowding, and had no discernible effects on welfare indicators (poverty, school <b>attendance,</b> occupation <b>ratio,</b> etc.). This could be due to high residential segregation, as the public housing was in remote locations very far from job opportunities. Following the analytical framework in Sect.  3, the poor would not move further out because they usually cannot afford the transport cost to go to work.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade or so, {{education}} data from household surveys have been used to complement, supplement and sometimes even substitute for country administrative data on participation and non-participation in schooling. There has been a gradual increase in the use of these household survey data on the demand for schooling, and these data now are used widely in intra- and cross-country comparisons made by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), UNICEF, the World Bank and many other providers and consumers of education statistics. Country-level use of household survey education data, however, has been more limited. The indicators most often produced using household survey data are the net and gross <b>attendance</b> <b>ratios</b> (NAR and GAR), which typically are treated as comparable to the net and gross enrolment ratios (NER and GER) produced using administrative data. However, there are conceptual differences between enrolment and attendance, with both providing imperfect measures of participation in schooling (UIS, 2004). As the attention to household survey data has increased, and sometimes substantial discrepancies with administrative data have emerged, awareness of the data challenges {{associated with the use of}} both administrative and household survey data has grown (see UIS, 2004; UIS, 2010; Omoeva et al., 2013; and Barakat, 2016). In some respects – given the differences in what is being measured by administrative and household survey data (enrolment versus attendance) and the multiple sources of error inherent in each approach, it would be astonishing to find that on the whole enrolment and attendance rates that are comparable. At the same time, given that the attendance and enrolment indicators measure not dissimilar things, the magnitude of difference should not be extreme. Some studies have identified substantial differences between these indicators, however, pointing to serious estimation questions (UIS, 2005; Omoeva et al., 2013). This information paper characterises and explains variations between administrative and household survey estimates of the numbers and rates of out-of-school children (OOSC) at the primary and lower secondary levels, and suggests ways that data from the two sources might be harmonised. This document also discusses issues surrounding the measurement of exclusion from education for youth of upper secondary age, given this population’s competing rights of access to education and the right to work. Administrative and household survey data efforts, as the UIS and UNICEF (2015) note, differ in purpose, in who collects the data and in what ways, and when and with what frequency. And yet because both data sources provide useful education data on similar topics, the data are examined side by side...|$|R

A population-based case-control study was carried out in certain regions of Québec, Canada, in 1989 – 95 including 491 incident cases diagnosed between 1980 and 1993 and aged between 0 and 9 years.

40|$|The {{proportion}} of children entering primary {{school at the}} stipulated age in 2010 in Sub-Saharan Africa was 57 %. For the same year, the net <b>attendance</b> <b>ratios</b> for primary and lower secondary education were 76 % and 47 % respectively. These figures are correlated in that delayed school enrolment {{increases the risk of}} dropout which in turn shortens the school life expectancy for children. These observations are the motivation behind this research. By writing this thesis, three substantive research questions have been explored: (1) what is Sierra Leone’s progress towards achieving universal basic education (2) what are the determinants of school attendance at basic education in West Africa and (3) does living in a community with more educated mothers enhance children’s school attendance at basic education. Three countries have been used: Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ghana. Sierra Leone and Liberia have been used to reflect poor and post-conflict states with transitional and premature education systems respectively. Ghana is representative of middle income and politically stable countries with more advanced education systems in the region. The most recent Demographic and Health Survey for the three countries are used for analysis. Four empirical chapters are presented. The first chapter addresses research question 1. It applies simple statistical analyses to United Nations indicators for evaluating progress towards universal education. The second and third chapters answer the second research question and the final chapter answers the third research question. These three chapters employ multilevel statistical techniques to model the determinants of primary and junior secondary school attendance. The second empirical chapter focuses on the interaction between household and community poverty with the aim of investigating whether the attendance of poor children suffers more than affluent children by residing in a poor community. The third empirical chapter explores the determinants of junior secondary school attendance with the aim of deducing whether there are significant differences between post-conflict countries and more stable countries. The final chapter focuses on the relationship between mothers’ education and school attendance at basic education, arguing that living in a community with a high {{proportion of}} more educated mothers enhances the likelihood that a child will attend school, irrespective of the child’s background. The results from the first chapter show that the realisation of UBE is distant in Sierra Leone. There has been a {{decline in the number of}} children entering primary education; junior secondary education has however doubled although it remains low at 21 %. Children from the poorest households are the most excluded from school followed by rural children and girls. The results from the second empirical chapter showed that there is a significant interaction between household and community poverty where poor children living in poor communities experience a greater depreciation in their probability of attending school than more affluent children who live in the same deprived environment in Sierra Leone. No such interaction was found in Liberia or Ghana. In the third empirical chapter, the sex of the child, agricultural livelihood within a community, household wealth and area of residence were significant in Sierra Leone and Liberia. In Ghana, sex of the household head and maternal orphanhood were significant. The hypothesis of the relationship between mothers’ community education and children’s school attendance for the final empirical chapter was confirmed...|$|R
40|$|Dispersed {{community}} {{outbreaks of}} Shigella sonnei have occurred cyclically among traditionally observant Jews in the United States. In February 2000, we investigated a S. sonnei outbreak in one Jewish community in New York City. To determine {{risk factors for}} introduction of infection into households, we conducted a cohort study of households to compare risk factors for illness among primary subjects within households and age-matched well siblings. Isolates were subtyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We used a random effects model to assess extra-household vs. intra-household transmission in households with multiple ill household members. Daycare or pre-school <b>attendance</b> [matched odds <b>ratio</b> (mOR) 16 · 1, P< 0 · 001] and age < 60 months (mOR 6 · 3, P< 0 · 001) were independently associated with index subject illness. Outbreak isolates were closely related by PFGE analysis to the strain previously observed in Jewish community outbreaks. The random effects model strongly indicated that multiple illnesses in a single household are due to secondary transmission. Disease containment efforts should focus on reducing Shigella transmission in childcare settings and within homes...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between risk factors for childhood unintentional injury and injury outcome and to assess the feasibility of using risk factors to identify children at high risk of injury. SETTING: One general practice in Nottingham, UK. METHOD: A postal questionnaire survey to all parents of children registered with the practice (n = 771) to obtain data on risk and sociodemographic factors. All children still registered with the practice one year later were followed up for occurrence of a medically attended injury. RESULTS: The response rate was 78 %. The injury rate over the follow up year was 246 injuries per 1000 children. Previous medically attended injury was associated with each of the injury outcomes (odds ratio (confidence interval) for all attendances, 2. 33 (1. 37 to 4. 05); for accident and emergency attendances, 2. 27 (1. 15 to 4. 4); and for primary health care team attendances, 2. 58 (1. 33 to 5. 0)). Male sex was associated only with accident and emergency department <b>attendance</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> 2. 13 (1. 06 to 4. 2)). Maternal age and previous injury were associated with a higher number of injuries in the subsequent year on univariate and multivariate analyses. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of the risk factors were low, except for previous injury and male sex. The number of children needing an injury prevention intervention to prevent one injury as identified by the risk factors was not significantly different from that required if a whole population approach were to be used. CONCLUSION: Primary care based injury prevention programmes, at present, should not be targeted at children identified as being at 'high risk' of injury. Nevertheless, a larger study using a wider cross section of the population is needed to address this issue further...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: {{domestic}} violence screening is advocated in some healthcare settings. Evidence that it increases referral to support agencies or improves health outcomes is limited. This study aimed to (1) investigate {{the proportion of}} hospital patients reporting {{domestic violence}}, (2) describe characteristics and previous hospital attendances of affected patients and (3) assess referrals to an in-house domestic violence advisor from Camden Safety Net. Design: a series of observational studies. Setting: three outpatient clinics at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust. Participants: 10 ? 158 patients screened for domestic violence in community gynaecology, genitourinary medicine (GUM) and HIV medicine clinics between 1 October 2013 and 30 June 2014. Also 2253 Camden Safety Net referrals over the same period. Main outcome measures: (1) Percentage reporting domestic violence by age group gender, ethnicity and clinic. (2) Rates of hospital attendances in the past 3 ?years for those screening positive and negative. (3) Characteristics, uptake and risk assessment results for hospital in-house domestic violence referrals compared with Camden Safety Net referrals from other sources. Results: of the 10 ? 158 patients screened, 57. 4 % were female with a median age of 30 ?years. Overall, 7. 1 % reported ever-experiencing domestic violence, ranging from 5. 7 % in GUM to 29. 4 % in HIV services. People screening positive for domestic violence had higher rates of previous emergency department <b>attendances</b> (rate <b>ratio</b> (RR) 1. 63, 95 % CI 1. 09 to 2. 48), emergency inpatient admissions (RR 2. 27, 95 % CI 1. 37 to 3. 84) and day-case admissions (RR 2. 03, 95 % CI 1. 23 to 3. 43) than those screening negative. The 77 hospital referrals to the hospital-based domestic violence advisor {{during the study period}} {{were more likely to be}} taken up and to be classified as high risk than referrals from elsewhere. Conclusions: selective screening for domestic violence in high-risk hospital clinic populations has the potential to identify affected patients and promote good uptake of referrals for in-house domestic violence suppor...|$|R
40|$|Background: Risk-taking {{behavior}} {{is a leading}} cause of injury and death amongst young people. Methodology and Principal Findings: This was a retrospective cohort study on the effectiveness of a 1 -day youth injury awareness education program (Prevent Alcohol and Risk-related Trauma in Youth, P. A. R. T. Y.) program in reducing risk taking behaviors and injuries of juvenille justice offenders in Western Australia. Of the 3659 juvenile justice offenders convicted by the court magistrates between 2006 and 2010, 225 were referred to the P. A. R. T. Y. education program. In a before and after survey of these 225 participants, a significant proportion of them stated that they were more receptive to modifying their risk-taking behavior (21 % before vs. 57 % after). Using data from the Western Australia Police and Department of Health, the incidence of subsequent offences and injuries of all juvenile justice offenders was assessed. The incidence of subsequent traffic or violence-related offences was significantly lower for those who had attended the program compared to those who did not (3. 6 % vs. 26. 8 %; absolute risk reduction [ARR] = 23. 2 %, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 19. 9 %– 25. 8 %; number needed to benefit = 4. 3, 95 %CI 3. 9 – 5. 1; p = 0. 001), as were injuries leading to hospitalization (0 % vs. 1. 6 % including 0. 2 % fatality; ARR = 1. 6 %, 95 %CI 1. 2 %– 2. 1 %) and alcohol or drug-related offences (0 % vs. 2. 4 %; ARR 2. 4 %, 95 %CI 1. 9 %– 2. 9 %).

40|$|Abstract Background Breast {{screening}} uptake in London {{is below}} the Government's target of 70 % and we investigate whether ethnicity affects this. Information on the ethnicity for the individual women invited is unavailable, so we use an area-based method similar to that routinely used to derive a geographical measure for socioeconomic deprivation. Methods We extracted 742, 786 observations on attendance for routine appointments between 2004 and 2007 collected by the London Quality Assurance Reference Centre. Each woman was assigned to a lower super output (LSOA) based on her postcode of residence. The proportions of the ethnic groups within each LSOA are known, so that {{the likelihood of a}} woman belonging to White, Black and Asian groups can be assigned. We investigated screening attendance by age group, socioeconomic deprivation using the Index of Deprivation 2004 income quintile, invitation type and breast screening service. Using logistic regression analysis we calculated odds <b>ratios</b> for <b>attendance</b> based on ethnic composition of the population, adjusting for age, socioeconomic status, the invitation type and screening service. Results The unadjusted <b>attendance</b> odds <b>ratios</b> were high for the White population (OR: 3. 34 95 % CI [3. 26 - 3. 42]) and low for the Black population (0. 13 [0. 12 - 0. 13]) and the Asian population (0. 55 [0. 53 - 0. 56]). Multivariate adjustment reduced the differences, but the Black population remained below unity (0. 47 [0. 44 - 0. 50]); while the White (1. 30 [1. 26 - 1. 35]) and Asian populations (1. 10 [1. 05 - 1. 15]) were higher. There was little difference in the attendance between age groups. Attendance was highest for the most affluent group and fell sharply with increasing deprivation. For invitation type, the routine recall was higher than the first call. There were wide variations in the attendance for different ethnic groups between the individual screening services. Conclusions Overall breast screening attendance is low in communities with large Black populations, suggesting the need to improve participation of Black women. Variations in attendance for the Asian population require further investigation at an individual screening service level. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackgroundHIV-related stigma {{diminishes the}} quality of life of {{affected}} patients. Little is known about perceived and enacted stigma of HIV-infected children in resources-limited settings. We documented the prevalence of perceived stigma and associated factors associated among children on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at a referral hospital in Cambodia. MethodsAfter informed consent, a standardized pre-tested 47 -item questionnaire was confidentially administered to consecutive children (7 to 15  years) or their guardians if the child was 18  months to 6  years, during their routine ART visits. The questionnaire explored the sociodemographics of the child and the parents, HIV history, adherence to ART, tolerance of ART and perceived stigma. Associations between perceived stigma and the children¿s characteristics were measured by bivariate and multivariate analyses. ResultsOf 183 children, 101 (55. 2 %) had lost at least one and 45 (24. 6 %) both parents; 166 (90. 7 %) went to school. Of 183 children (female: 84, 45. 9 %, median age 7. 0  years, interquartile range: 2. 0 - 9. 6), 79 (43. 2 %) experienced perceived stigma, including rejection by others (26. 8 %), no invitations to social activities (18. 6 %) and exclusion from games (14. 2 %). A total of 43 (23. 5 %) children were fearful of their disease and 61 (53. 9 %) of 113 older than 6  years reported knowledge of their HIV status. Of 136 children over five years and eligible for education, 7 (3. 8 %) could not go to school due to perceived stigma. Incomplete adherence to ART was reported for 17 (9. 2 %) children. In multivariate analysis, school <b>attendance</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> [OR]: 3. 9; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2. 0 - 7. 9) and income of less than one dollar per person per day (OR: 2. 2, 95 %CI: 1. 1 - 4. 5) were associated with perceived stigma. Conversely, receipt of social support (OR: 0. 4, 95 % CI 0. 2 - 0. 9) was associated with lower risk of perceived stigma. ConclusionPerceived stigma in pediatric ART patients remains a significant issue in Cambodia. Psychological support and interventions should be developed in hospitals, schools, and underprivileged communities to prevent HIV-related stigma for affected children...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{the primary}} care setting, {{compliance}} with lipid lowering therapy was relatively low. In order to compare the efficacy of a short messaging service (SMS) text messaging and postal reminder as means of improving attendance rates during the first 24 weeks of lipid-lowering therapy, a randomized controlled trial of 918 patients from 19 family practice clinics was conducted between February 2003 and June 2006. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned into 3 groups: SMS (327), postal (294),and control (297) group. To ascertain attendance rates, patients were followed up at 24 weeks after their treatment. Reminders were sent at 16 weeks from the coordinating center. Results: Overall attendance rate was 74. 1 %. This differed between groups, with 76. 1 % attendance for the SMS group, 73. 5 % for the postal group, and 72. 4 % for the control group. According to a multivariate analysis, the SMS group had a significantly higher <b>attendance</b> rate (Odds <b>ratios</b> [OR] 1. 48; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 01 to 2. 16) than the control group, but the postal group (OR, 1. 15; 95 % CI, 0. 79 to 1. 69) did not. Moreover, the cost per attendance for the SMS reminder (155 Korean Won [KRW]) was much lower than that for the postal reminder (722 KRW). Conclusion: SMS reminder may be more cost saving method to improve the attendance rate compared with the posta...|$|R

40|$|Seabirds are {{considered}} one of the most threatened groups of birds in the world. They face additional mortality both on their breeding islands from introduced predators and at sea by fishing fleets, as fisheries bycatch, as well as other human impacts. Seabird bycatch has negatively affected many seabird populations worldwide, with trawl, gillnet and longline fisheries considered the most destructive to seabird populations. Seabird bycatch from trawl and gillnet fisheries has been significantly reduced in recent years, but large numbers of seabirds are still killed annually by longline fisheries. Of the two types of longline fisheries (demersal and pelagic), pelagic longlining is considered the most harmful to seabirds as lines remain closer to the surface for longer periods than demersal longlining, and it is harder to weight lines to ensure rapid sinking beyond the depth they are accessible to birds. Seabirds are killed when they swallow baited hooks and consequently drown. Despite the large number of studies investigating seabird bycatch from pelagic longline fisheries, there remain gaps in our understanding of seabird bycatch from pelagic longline fisheries. This thesis addresses some of these knowledge gaps and makes recommendations as to how seabird bycatch from pelagic longliners can be reduced at both a local and global scale. Chapters 2 and 3 investigate the factors affecting seabird bycatch from pelagic longliners off South Africa, provide a summary of seabird bycatch from the fishery for the period 2006 – 2013 and quantify the structure of seabird assemblages associated with pelagic longline vessels off South Africa. This was achieved by analysing seabird bycatch data collected by fisheries observers as well as data from sea trials onboard pelagic longliners. Seabird bycatch by pelagic longliners off South Africa over the 8 -year study period has been significantly reduced from the 8 -year period (1998 – 2005), mainly driven by a significant reduction in seabird bycatch rates from foreign-flagged vessels, which are responsible for c. 80 % of fishing effort off South Africa. Seabird bycatch rates from South African vessels still remain high, four times higher than the interim national target of < 0. 05 birds per 1000 hooks. The species composition of seabird bycatch off South Africa is best explained by an understanding of the structure of the seabird assemblage associated with longline vessels. For most species, bycatch and <b>attendance</b> <b>ratios</b> were similar, but for some species such as shy-type and black-browed albatrosses there were large mismatches, likely caused by differences in foraging behaviour and foraging dominance hierarchies. In Chapters 4 and 5 the foraging ecology of the most commonly recorded bycatch species off South Africa, the white-chinned petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis), is investigated. An understanding of the foraging ecology of commonly recorded bycatch species enhances our understanding of seabird bycatch and helps to improve the design of current and future mitigation measures. The year-round movements of white-chinned petrels from Marion Island were investigated with Global Location Sensors (GLS loggers) and GPS loggers. Adult white-chinned petrels undertake only limited east-west movements of, with all birds remaining between southern Africa and Antarctica. These results strengthen the theory that there is limited spatial overlap year-round between white-chinned petrel populations from South Georgia, the southern Indian Ocean islands and New Zealand sub-Antarctic islands, suggesting that these populations can be managed as separate stocks. The diving behaviour of white-chinned and grey petrels (P. cinerea), another common bycatch species in Southern Ocean longline fleets, were examined with the use of temperature-depth recorders (TDRs), deployed on birds from Marion Island and Gough Island. My study was the first to analyse TDR dive data from any Procellaria petrel, and recorded them reaching maximum dive depths of 16 and 22 m, respectively. Current best practise suggests that baited hooks be protected to a depth of 5 m by bird-scaring lines, but my results suggest this depth should be increased to at least 10 m. Although line weighting is a proven mitigation measure to reduce seabird bycatch from pelagic longliners, fishers have concerns that it will compromise fish catches, crew safety and operational efficiency. In Chapter 6 I analyse line weighting data from trials onboard three pelagic longline vessels, to address the concerns of fishermen. My results show that sliding leads can be incorporated into pelagic longline fisheries without compromising fish catch, crew safety or operational efficiency. I thus recommend that sliding leads be used on pelagic longline vessels fishing off South Africa. By incorporating studies investigating the factors affecting seabird bycatch, seabird foraging ecology and the efficacy of seabird bycatch mitigation measures, my thesis has broadened our understating of seabird bycatch from pelagic longliners and makes meaningful recommendations to further reduce bycatch, both locally and globally. Although seabird bycatch rates have declined off South Africa, through the use of a number different mitigation measures, they still remain higher than the South African national target and thus more work is needed to achieve this target. To reduce seabird bycatch from pelagic longliners to acceptable levels, studies from the world's various longline fleets needs to be considered and improved upon, with seabird conservationists and fishermen working together to achieve this goal...|$|R

Data were collected from Missouri DESE for the 2004 - 2005 school year. The study design used descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and discriminate analysis (DA) to provide school personnel with information about factors that discriminate between school buildings that made AYP and those that did not. School building variables including school size, class size, student teacher <b>ratio,</b> <b>attendance</b> rate, dropout rate, and discipline reports were found to make significant differences in both the ANOVA and the DA. Student variables including free/reduced lunch, white, Black, Asian, Hispanic, Indian and level not determined in both CA and math were not found to discriminate between schools that made AYP and those that did not. Interestingly, all of the student variables except Hispanic were found to be significantly different using the ANOVA. Results of this study show that school building variables do make a difference in student achievement and that school personnel need to work with all students to improve achievement in this era of accountability for public schools. School districts have control over school building variables and need to find ways to either make schools smaller or seem smaller, make classes smaller, increase attendance, lower the dropout rate and lower the number of discipline reports...|$|R
40|$|Nepal’s {{national}} education strategies have sought equitable access and high quality {{education for all}} primary children. Progress towards Education For All (EFA) was examined through secondary data using trend analysis with regard to access, participation, equity and exclusion at primary level. Original research investigated learning outcomes in basic reading and arithmetic using an Annual Status Education Report (ASER) type survey. Quantitative methods were used to isolate factors showing high association with access and quality of education. A first analysis employed the Ordinary Least Square method with univariate and multivariate levels of estimation of student performance at school level. A second analysis applied Logistic Regression (univariate and multivariate level) to estimate the key predictor variables at an individual student level. In both analyses the models were employed at three levels of significance. Findings showed inequitable or non-inclusive enrolments and substantial disparities in access and participation particularly in ethnic minorities. There are major quality concerns: from the ASER type testing the majority of rural primary school children were unable to carry out basic number recognition and computation or simple reading in the Nepali language. This was particularly the case for girls and those from the lowest economic quintile. At school level, factors of student <b>attendance,</b> student teacher <b>ratio,</b> textbooks, and school location were statistically significant in relation to learning outcomes, however teacher training and qualifications were negative beta coefficients. At individual level, student characteristics and family factors such as gender, parental education, annual income and parental support {{were the most important}} in relation to student performance. Large disparities persist between geographic regions and underserved social groups with a disproportionate impact on girls, the poor and the most vulnerable ethnic minorities.
