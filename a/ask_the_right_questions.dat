In an interview with MTV News, the frontman explained that he was inspired by the will to document the personal changes experienced by the band and its audience. [...] "Most of the interviews", Leto explained, [...] "I did myself, so they're really intimate. It's me, it's them, and it's the camera. What I've found is, that if you talk to everybody long enough, you find an incredible story. Every single person has a moment in their life, something that they've found a solution for, a story to tell. Some are funny, some are really intriguing, and if you <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>questions,</b> you get interesting answers." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy {{published}} Kramer's book Ivory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Middle Eastern Studies in America.

2500|$|The {{report said}} that {{to the extent that}} {{district}} Board members, its Superintendent (who learned of TheftTrack at a meeting of his Cabinet in 2008), and its principals were aware of TheftTrack's capabilities, they [...] "did not appreciate the potential of that ability to raise serious privacy concerns, and they should have sought more information … or advice" [...] from the district lawyer. [...] The report also said that school Board members and school administrators who knew that tracking was in place failed to <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>questions</b> regarding privacy issues, district lawyers didn't probe the legal considerations of handing out computers, and administrators didn't talk about the ramifications. [...] It noted that Harriton High School Principal Kline, for example, learned about TheftTrack monitoring in September 2008, and said he asked DiMedio whether the district should advise students and parents about it. [...] But he never revisited the subject after DiMedio opined that the district should not because doing so would undermine TheftTrack's effectiveness. [...] The report faulted district administrators and staffers for failing to disclose and mismanaging the surveillance system, and for failing to establish strict policies to protect [...] "unsuspecting" [...] students' privacy.|$|E
2500|$|Prior {{to public}} release, Meirelles {{screened}} Blindness to test audiences. He described {{the impact of}} test screenings: [...] "If {{you know how to}} use it, how to <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>questions,</b> it can be really useful." [...] A test screening of Meirelles' first cut in Toronto resulted in ten percent of the audience, nearly 50 people, walking out of the film early. Meirelles ascribed the problem to a rape scene that takes place partway through the film, and edited the scene to be much shorter in the final cut. Meirelles explained his goal, [...] "When I shot and edited these scenes, I did it in a very technical way, I worried about how to light it and so on, and I lost the sense of their brutality. Some women were really angry with the film, and I thought, 'Wow, maybe I crossed the line.' I went back not to please the audience but so they would stay involved {{until the end of the}} story." [...] He also found that a New York City test screening expressed concern about a victim in the film failing to take revenge. Meirelles believed this concern to reflect what Americans have learned to expect in their cinema.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Abigail Thernstrom, {{reviewing}} Sowell's Intellectuals and Race for National Review, wrote [...] "This book is {{a wonderful}} spin-off from Thomas Sowell's magnificent 2009 volume Intellectuals and Society. For those who want a short introduction to Sowell-think, this small {{book is a}} perfect place to start. His main message—amply illustrated—is that, {{on the subject of}} race, intellectuals are useless. Indeed, they don't even <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>questions.</b> Thus, they're woefully lost when it comes to analyzing America's most important domestic issue: the status of blacks and the state of race relations. Of course his point about lame-brained intellectuals extends far beyond their writings on race. Indeed, his book is a primer on rigorous thinking about social and economic issues in general, here and abroad." [...] Thernstrom, herself a noted scholar of race relations and the Vice Chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, concluded, [...] "I didn't think I would learn much from Sowell's wonderful little book, having slogged through the literature on race since I was born—or at least it feels like it's been that long. But I did. Most NR readers will not have been masochistically race-obsessed for years, but this book's tough questions and clear-eyed answers should make them even more disgusted with America's anti-intellectual intelligentsia than they probably already are. Intellectuals and Race is a feast of hard thinking about America's ongoing racial agony." ...|$|E

50|$|PERMA {{not only}} {{plays a role}} in our own {{personal}} lives but also can be used for public major news stories. With this model, journalists can instead focus on the positives of a story and ask questions about how conflicts or even tragedies have brought people together, how someone has experienced post-traumatic growth, and more. News stories then shift the perspective from a victimizing one to an uplifting one. Positive psychology is slowly but steadily making its way through news reporting via constructive journalism. PERMA helps journalists <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>questions</b> to continue that progress by bringing the focus of a potentially negative story to the positives and solutions.|$|E
