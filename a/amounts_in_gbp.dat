40|$|Abstract Background Dengue virus (DENV), the causative {{agent of}} human Dengue hemorrhagic fever, is a mosquito-borne virus found in {{tropical}} and sub-tropical regions around the world. Vaccines against DENV are currently unavailable. Guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP 1) {{is one of}} the Interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs) and has been shown important for host immune defense against various pathogens. However, the role of GBP 1 during DENV infection remains unclarified. In this study, we evaluated the relevance of GBP 1 to DENV infection in in vitro model. Findings Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot showed that the expression of mouse Gbp 1 was dramatically upregulated in DENV-infected RAW 264. 7 cells. The intracellular DENV loads were significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>Gbp</b> 1 silenced cells compared with controls. The expression levels of selective anti-viral cytokines were decreased <b>in</b> <b>Gbp</b> 1 siRNA treated cells, while the transcription factor activity of NF-κB was impaired upon GBP 1 silencing during infection. Conclusions Our data suggested that GBP 1 plays an antiviral role during DENV infection. </p...|$|R

Here we test {{the role of}} <b>Gbp</b> 1 <b>in</b> the IFN-γ-dependent control of T. gondii in the mouse model. Virulent strains of T. gondii avoided recruitment of Gbp 1 to the parasitophorous vacuole in a strain-dependent manner that was mediated by the parasite virulence factors ROP 18, an active serine/threonine kinase, and the pseudokinase ROP 5. Increased recruitment of Gbp 1 to Δrop 18 or Δrop 5 parasites was associated with clearance in IFN-γ-activated macrophages in vitro, a process dependent on the autophagy protein Atg 5. The increased susceptibility of Δrop 18 mutants in IFN-γ-activated macrophages was reverted <b>in</b> <b>Gbp</b> 1 (-/-) cells, and decreased virulence of this mutant was compensated <b>in</b> <b>Gbp</b> 1 (-/-) mice, which were also more susceptible to challenge with type II strain parasites of intermediate virulence.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{gastrointestinal}} hormone responses to meals in morbidly obese patients before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP; n = 9) or vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG; n = 7). On consecutive days before and after operation, we measured changes in peripheral blood levels of glucose, insulin, enteroglucagon, serotonin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and cholecystokinin (CCK) in response to a standardized glucose or protein-fat meal. The percentage of excess weight lost at 6 months after operation was 66. 3 % +/- 4 % and 41. 8 % +/- 5 % for GBP and VBG, respectively (p less than 0. 01). The 3 -hour integrated glucose response to a glucose meal decreased from 145. 3 +/- 33. 7 to 75. 8 +/- 15. 7 g min/L (p less than 0. 02) after GBP. This was associated with a decrease in 3 -hour integrated insulin response from 22. 8 +/- 8. 2 to 10. 5 +/- 4. 9 mU min/L. Vertical banded gastroplasty patients had lesser reductions of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Neither the CCK, serotonin, nor VIP responses to meals were altered by either operation. The 3 -hour integrated enteroglucagon response to glucose increased markedly <b>in</b> <b>GBP</b> patients after operation from 11. 8 +/- 6 to 133. 4 +/- 38 nmol min/mL (p less than 0. 02). This increase in enteroglucagon occurred at the same time as development of dumping symptoms, which occurred exclusively <b>in</b> <b>GBP</b> patients after glucose but not protein. We conclude that (1) GBP surgery for morbid obesity results in amelioration of glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia, (2) CCK does not mediate an endocrine satiety effect of surgery, (3) GBP is associated with an exaggerated enteroglucagon response to glucose, and (4) enteroglucagon appears to be a marker of the dumping syndrome <b>in</b> <b>GBP</b> patients...|$|R

Using WT, stat 1 (-/-), or irf 1 (-/-) cells, we analyzed the changes induced by IFN-gamma <b>in</b> <b>gbp</b> 2 promoter chromatin. STAT 1 {{associated with the}} promoter independently of IRF 1 and played {{an essential role in}} the ordered recruitment of the coactivator/histone acetyl transferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) and the histone deacetylase HDAC 1. Hyperacetylation of histone 4 also required STAT 1. Phosphorylation at S 727 in the transactivating domain increased transcriptional activity of STAT 1. In cells expressing a STAT 1 S 727 A-mutant CBP recruitment, histone 4 hyperacetylation and RNA polymerase II association with the gbp 2 promoter were strongly reduced. IRF 1 association with the gbp 2 promoter followed that of STAT 1, but STAT 1 association with DNA or histone hyperacetylation were not necessary for IRF 1 binding. RNA polymerase II association with the gbp 2 promoter required both STAT 1 and IRF 1, suggesting that both proteins mediate essential steps in transcriptional activation. IRF 1, but not STAT 1, was found to coimmunoprecipitate with RNA polymerase II. Together, the data support the assumption that the main role of STAT 1 <b>in</b> activating <b>gbp</b> 2 transcription is to provide transcriptionally competent chromatin, whereas the function of IRF 1 may lie in directly contacting RNA polymerase II-containing transcriptional complexes...|$|R

This is consistent with the observations by numerous previous studies on single or double starch biosynthetic gene-recessive mutants of SSI, SSIIa and SBEIIb proteins, not only in rice but other cereals (Morell et al. 2003; Nakamura et al. 2005 a; Kosar-Hashemi et al. 2007; Grimaud et al. 2008; Li et al. 2011). Therefore, detecting significant changes in the abundance and composition of GBPs is an alternative approach to screen variants with favorable starch structure and functional properties.|$|R
