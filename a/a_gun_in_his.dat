5|$|In 1991, Gregory Banks, {{a convicted}} felon, filed {{a civil suit}} for $16 million in damages against Burge, three colleagues, and the City of Chicago for condoning {{brutality}} and torture. He {{said that he had}} falsely confessed in 1983 to murder after he was tortured by officers: they placed a plastic bag over his head, put <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mouth, and performed other acts. He said that the officers allegedly abused eleven other suspects, using such measures as electro-shock. The suit was brought by the People's Law Office attorneys who had represented Andrew Wilson in the 1989 police brutality case. The suit described 23 incidents against black and Hispanic suspects between 19721985. The Bank's suit named Sergeant Peter Dignan as one of the officers involved in the abuses. In 1995 Dignan was promoted for meritorious service, even though the City of Chicago had settled out of court with Banks on his suit.|$|E
5|$|Reports were {{received}} in January 1849 that some Aboriginal {{people had been}} killed near Guichen Bay. On 19 February, the Protector of Aborigines, Matthew Moorhouse arrived in the district to investigate. He began his inquiries, assisted by a mounted policeman, an interpreter, and an Aboriginal guide. An Aboriginal witness, Leandermin, took Moorhouse {{to the site of}} the alleged crime. He told Moorhouse that he and a white man named Parker were walking along a road when they heard shots. He went to see what was happening, and from behind some trees, saw four or five Aboriginal women lying on the ground with fresh wounds. He also saw others on the ground, who he presumed were dead because they were not moving. Two white men were present, Leandermin identified Brown as one of them, and stated that Brown had <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|E

25|$|The planned executions went as high {{as acting}} boss D'Arco. Furious over the failed hit on Chiodo, Amuso set up D'Arco to be killed at a Manhattan hotel. However, this hit also came undone after D'Arco saw a man hide <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> shirt, then slip it into the bathroom. Recognizing this as a classic setup for a hit, D'Arco fled for his life and turned himself over to the {{authorities}} to spare {{him and his family}} from Amuso and Casso and their increasingly erratic demands. He was the first boss of a New York crime family, acting or otherwise, to become an informant.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{guilty plea}} on {{misdemeanor}} weapons charges during the 2009 offseason, Lynch met with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for a disciplinary hearing. Lynch {{had been arrested}} in Culver City, California, for having <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> backpack {{in the trunk of}} a car he was occupying, a crime in California. On April 9, the NFL announced that Lynch would be suspended for the Bills' first three games for violations of the NFL's personal conduct policy. Lynch appealed the league's suspension on May 14 in an attempt to have it reduced or nullified, only to have it upheld by Goodell later on August 3. When interviewed on the topic, Lynch has said that he was not surprised when the suspension was upheld and that he loves playing too much and will try to keep himself out of situations {{in which there is a}} risk of being suspended.|$|E

25|$|Following Georgia's first {{democratic}} parliamentary {{and presidential}} elections, President Zviad Gamsakhurdia appointed Aslan Abashidze {{as the head}} of the Adjara's Supreme Council on March 15, 1991 hoping that the latter would assist in canceling the autonomous status of the region. However, when Gamsakhurdia proposed to abolish Adjarian autonomy, Abashidze called Adjarians, especially the Muslims of the region, to rise in protest. Tensions with central Georgian authorities ensued. On 22 April 1991, pro-Abashidze protesters stormed administrative buildings in the central Batumi demanding the immediate resignation of several officials. The protests were effectively used by Abashidze to establish his own powerbase in the region. Gamsakhurdia facing serious internal problems already in Tbilisi preferred not to interfere in the Adjarian events. In turmoil, Nodar Imnadze, Abashidze's deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet and the highest placed supporter of Gamsakhurdia in Adjara, was killed in highly controversial circumstances. In Batumi's version, Imnadze was shot by guards while attempting to burst in Abashidze's office with <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands. The Tbilisi-controlled media simply printed unspecified obituaries. However, many claims have been made that Imnadze was killed by Abashidze himself during the argument at office.|$|E

500|$|Maurice Clemmons's {{father made}} frames for {{automobile}} seats at a Chrysler factory, and his mother, Dorothy Mae Clemmons, {{worked in a}} nursing home. He had five siblings. Clemmons lived in Marianna, Arkansas in his early youth, and moved to Little Rock as a teen. He was arrested {{when he was a}} junior at Hall High School for carrying a [...]25-caliber pistol on school property. He claimed to be carrying the gun because he was [...] "beaten by dopers", and said he had [...] "something for them" [...] if they attacked him again. Clemmons did not return to school, and finished his education at eleventh grade. In 1989, a 17-year-old Clemmons and two other accomplices robbed a woman at midnight {{in the parking lot of}} a Little Rock hotel bar. Clemmons pretended to have <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> pocket and threatened to shoot her if she did not give him her purse. When she responded, [...] "Well, why don't you just shoot?", he punched her in the head and ran off with the purse, which contained $16 and a credit card.|$|E

Markham identified Lee Harvey Oswald as Tippit's killer in a police lineup she viewed that evening. Barbara Davis and her sister-in-law Virginia Davis heard the shots and saw a man crossing their lawn, shaking his revolver, {{as if he were}} emptying it of cartridge cases. Later, the women found two cartridge cases near the crime scene and handed the cases over to police.|$|E

2500|$|The motives behind Whitney's {{acceptance}} of a contract to manufacture muskets in 1798 were mostly monetary. By the late 1790s, Whitney {{was on the verge}} of bankruptcy and the cotton gin litigation had left him deeply in debt. His New Haven cotton gin factory had burned to the ground, and litigation sapped his remaining resources. The French Revolution had ignited new conflicts between Great Britain, France, and the United States. The new American government, realizing the need to prepare for war, began to rearm. The War Department issued contracts for the manufacture of 10,000 muskets. Whitney, who had never made <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life, obtained a contract in January 1798 to deliver 10,000 to 15,000 muskets in 1800. He had not mentioned interchangeable parts at that time. [...] Ten months later, the Treasury Secretary, Oliver Wolcott, Jr., sent him a [...] "foreign pamphlet on arms manufacturing techniques," [...] possibly one of Honoré Blanc's reports, after which Whitney first began to talk about interchangeability.|$|E

Arrested by the town marshal, the official retaliated by having Odell arrested for [...] "congregating" [...] in violation of the injunction. Odell served 10 days in jail for contempt of court. Pollock, too, was arrested and jailed. When a truckload of strikebreakers attempted to run down a group of pickets, the pickets (led by Pollock) retaliated by hurling stones and bottles at the truck. Pollock was charged with unlawful assemblage, inciting to riot, and malicious destruction of property. [...] Pollock's wife and defense lawyers were unlawfully denied access to him for several days. When they finally did see him, sheriff's deputies stood close by to intimidate them and listen in on their privileged conversation.|$|E

She was sentenced to prison on May 4, 1982, and released on June 30, 1983. On May 1, 1984, Wuornos was arrested for attempting to pass forged checks at a bank in Key West. On November 30, 1985, she was named as {{a suspect in the}} theft of a revolver and ammunition in Pasco County. On January 4, 1986, Wuornos {{was arrested in}} Miami and charged with car theft, resisting arrest, and obstruction of justice for providing identification bearing her aunt's name. Miami police officers found a [...]38-caliber revolver and a box of ammunition in the stolen car.

2500|$|The Commonwealth {{relied on}} {{evidence}} that Sacco was absent {{from his work}} in a shoe factory {{on the day of}} the murders; that the defendants were in the neighborhood of the Braintree robbery-murder scene on the morning when it occurred, being identified as having been there seen separately and also together; that the Buick getaway car was also in the neighborhood and that Vanzetti was near and in it; that Sacco was seen near the scene of the murders before they occurred and also was seen to shoot Berardelli after Berardelli fell and that that shot caused his death; that used shell casings were left at the scene of the murders, some of which could have been found to have been discharged from a [...]32 pistol afterwards found on Sacco; that a cap was found at the scene of the murders, which witnesses identified as resembling one formerly worn by Sacco; and that both men were members of anarchist cells that espoused violence, including assassination.
