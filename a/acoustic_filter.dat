Some multitrack recordings were made on optical sound film, which led to new advances used primarily by MGM (as early as 1937) and 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation (as early as 1941). RCA Victor began recording performances by several orchestras using optical sound around 1941, resulting in higher-fidelity masters for 78-rpm discs. During the 1930s, Avery Fisher, an amateur violinist, began {{experimenting with a}}udio design and acoustics.

40|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>filters</b> for signal {{filtering}} {{are used}} in wireless technologies operating at gigahertz frequencies for communication systems such as next generation cell phones. Multilayered porous silicon structures have been fabricated from silicon wafers to create the Bragg mirror section of a bulk <b>acoustic</b> wave <b>filter.</b> These porous silicon multilayers have been designed for use from 500 MHz – 20 GHz with primary focus on frequencies at 1 GHz. The porous silicon multilayers consist of alternating layers {{of high and low}} acoustic impedance layers on a bulk silicon substrate. They are fabricated using electrochemical etching where the current density during the etch determines the porosity and hence acoustic impedance of each layer. Bragg mirrors, FabryPerot filters, microcavities and rugate filters can be produced in this way due to the control of the tuneable porosity profile throughout the structure. The porosity of the layer modifies the elastic constants of the layer such as the Young’s modulus and hence the velocity of the bulk acoustic waves travelling through it. The behaviour of bulk acoustic waves through silicon is known but in order to fabricate porous silicon <b>acoustic</b> <b>filters,</b> the dependence of the longitudinal wave velocity as a function of porosity must also be known. This has been studied using acoustic transmission measurements on single porous silicon layers and then extended to multilayered structures. Rugate filters are single frequency filters that have not previously been studied for acoustic applications. In this study the first <b>acoustic</b> rugate <b>filters</b> have been fabricated using porous silicon material that exhibit only one stopband near 1 GHz. Bragg mirrors have been made with acoustic transmission measurements showing the locations of the stopbands.

40|$|Abstract. In {{performing}} blind deconvolution {{to remove}} reverberation from speech signal, most <b>acoustic</b> deconvolution <b>filters</b> need {{a great many}} number of taps, and acoustic environments are often time-varying. There-fore, deconvolution filter coefficients should find their desired values with limited data, but conventional methods need lots of data to converge the coefficients. In this paper, we use sparse priors on the <b>acoustic</b> decon-volution <b>filters</b> {{to speed up the}} convergence and obtain better perfor-mance. In order to derive a learning algorithm which includes priors on the deconvolution filters, we discuss that a deconvolution algorithm can be obtained by the joint probability density of observed signal and the algorithm includes prior information through the posterior probability density. Simulation results show that sparseness on the <b>acoustic</b> decon-volution <b>filters</b> can be successfully used for adaptation of the filters by improving convergence and performance. ...|$|R
