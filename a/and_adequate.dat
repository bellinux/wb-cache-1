5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I in 1914, Dr. Robert Heindl of Germany had noted that the 15,000 political prisoners at the penal colony could create an undesirable revolution and therefore their release in one stage, following capture of the island by a German ship by bombardment, was risky. He suggested that after due care <b>and</b> <b>adequate</b> security had {{been put in place}} the convicts of the penal colony could be shifted to the mainland in small boats.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of any form of mass transit besides bus prior to 2008, the Phoenix Metropolitan Area has {{remained}} a very automobile-dependent city, with its first freeway opening in 1958—a year preceding most cities' first freeway openings.

5|$|Galleys were {{effective}} as troop transports for amphibious operations, but were severely under-gunned, especially {{in relation to}} their large crews; a galley with a 250-man crew, most of whom were rowers, would typically carry only one 24-pounder cannon and two 6-pounders, all in the bow. The galleys also lacked decks <b>and</b> <b>adequate</b> shelter for the rower-soldiers, many of whom succumbed to illness as a result of exposure during the war of 1741–43.|$|E

Recent {{research}} of the author has given an explicit geometric description of free (two-sided) <b>adequate</b> semigroups <b>and</b> monoids, as sets of labelled directed trees under a natural combinatorial multiplication. In this paper we show that there are natural embeddings of each free right <b>adequate</b> <b>and</b> free left <b>adequate</b> semigroup or monoid into the corresponding free adequate semigroup or monoid. The corresponding classes of trees are easily described and the resulting geometric representation of free left <b>adequate</b> <b>and</b> free right <b>adequate</b> semigroups is even easier to understand than that in the two-sided case. We use it to establish some basic structural properties of free left <b>and</b> right <b>adequate</b> semigroups <b>and</b> monoids. 1...|$|R

5|$|As {{the trade}} {{deadline}} approached, it was {{speculated that the}} Phillies would surrender older players to obtain younger ones. They made two deals, neither involving key components of the team. In August they had their best month of the season: a 14–13 record, thanks to strong pitching <b>and</b> <b>adequate</b> hitting. Although the Phillies began September with four pitchers combining for a no-hitter, their month deteriorated from there. The squad had an 11–15 record, finishing the season with 73 wins and 89 losses. Significant personnel changes {{on the field and}} in the front office were expected during the offseason.|$|E
5|$|Contact {{with skin}} is dangerous, <b>and</b> <b>adequate</b> {{ventilation}} {{should be provided}} when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin. Exposure by inhalation should not exceed 0.1mg per cubic metre in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium will readily absorb through the skin and care {{should be taken to}} avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received by inhalation at the PEL. Thallium is a suspected human carcinogen. For a long time thallium compounds were readily available as rat poison. This fact and that it is water-soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{continued}} designs {{and interest in}} the idea, no funding was ever appropriated {{for the construction of}} a flight-deck cruiser; in addition, evaluation of the design by the Naval War College determined that even a 12,000-ton ship was too small for the concept's intended characteristics to be effectively realized, and thus the ship would be ineffective in battle. In 1940, the design was formally shelved, although provision was made for reconsideration of the concept at a future date. The entry of the United States into World War II following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, however, removed the primary justifications for the concept of a hybrid warship, as naval limitations treaties were now moot <b>and</b> <b>adequate</b> funding was now available for the construction of more conventional ships. As a result, the flight deck cruiser concept was never revisited.|$|E

If any of these variables is in any way compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{stated that}} the caste system in south India is, due to Indo-Aryan influence, linked {{with the arrival of}} Brahmins from the north. Ancient Tamil Nadu (part of Tamilakkam) had a {{different}} stratification of society in four or five regions (Tinai), determined by natural surroundings <b>and</b> <b>adequate</b> means of living. Periyar also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do not create castes, or differences of high and low in their own species. But man, considered to be a rational being, was suffering from these because of religion and discrimination.|$|E

5|$|Anglo-Norman warfare {{during the}} reign of Stephen was characterised by attritional {{military}} campaigns, in which commanders tried to seize key enemy castles in order to allow them to take control of their adversaries' territory and ultimately win a slow, strategic victory. The armies of the period centred on bodies of mounted, armoured knights, supported by infantry and crossbowmen. These forces were either feudal levies, drawn up by local nobles for a limited period of service during a campaign, or, increasingly, mercenaries, who were expensive but more flexible and often more skilled. These armies, however, were ill-suited to besieging castles, whether the older motte-and-bailey designs or the newer, stone-built keeps. Existing siege engines were significantly less powerful than the later trebuchet designs, giving defenders a substantial advantage over attackers. As a result, slow sieges to starve defenders out, or mining operations to undermine walls, tended to be preferred by commanders over direct assaults. Occasionally pitched battles were fought between armies but these were considered highly risky endeavours and were usually avoided by prudent commanders. The cost of warfare had risen considerably {{in the first part of}} the 12th century, <b>and</b> <b>adequate</b> supplies of ready cash were increasingly proving important in the success of campaigns.|$|E
