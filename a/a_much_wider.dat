Also, the later actinides from californium onwards behave more like the corresponding lanthanides, with only the valence +3 (and sometimes +2) shown.|$|E

In addition to their aircraft, the vessels carry short-range defensive weaponry for anti-aircraft warfare and missile defense.|$|E
5|$|There {{are certain}} distributions, {{especially}} those with three or more parameters, whose likelihoods may become infinite along certain paths in the parameter space. Using maximum likelihood to estimate these parameters often breaks down, with one parameter tending to the specific value that causes the likelihood to be infinite, rendering the other parameters inconsistent. The method of maximum spacings, however, being dependent on the difference between points on the cumulative distribution function and not individual likelihood points, does not have this issue, and will return valid results over <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>wider</b> array of distributions.|$|E

These hangars are divided into three bays by thick steel doors that are designed to restrict the spread of fire.|$|E
5|$|An English {{cultural}} identity first {{emerged from the}} interaction of the Germanic immigrants of the 5th and 6th centuries and the indigenous Romano-British inhabitants. Although early medieval chroniclers described the immigrants as Angles and Saxons, they came from <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>wider</b> area across Northern Europe, and represented a range of different ethnic groups. Over the 6th century, however, these different groups began to coalesce into stratified societies across England, roughly corresponding to the later Angle and Saxon kingdoms recorded by Bede in the 8th century. By the 9th century, the term the Angelcynn was being officially used to refer to a single English people, and promoted for propaganda purposes by chroniclers and kings to inspire resistance to the Danish invasions.|$|E
5|$|Anglo-Saxon kings ruled through ealdormen, who had {{the highest}} lay status under the king. In ninth-century Wessex they each ruled a single shire, but {{by the middle of}} the tenth they had {{authority}} over <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>wider</b> area, a change probably introduced by Æthelstan to deal with the problems of governing his extended realm. One of the ealdormen, who was also called Æthelstan, governed the eastern Danelaw territory of East Anglia, the largest and wealthiest province of England. After the king's death, he became so powerful that he was known as Æthelstan Half-King. Several of the ealdormen who witnessed charters had Scandinavian names, and while the localities they came from cannot be identified, they were almost certainly the successors of the earls who led Danish armies in the time of Edward the Elder, and who were retained by Æthelstan as his representatives in local government.|$|E

5|$|Conway Morris {{found that}} the shelly fossils in Walcott's Phyllopod Bed were about as {{abundant}} as in other shelly fossil deposits, but accounted for only 14% of the Phyllopod Bed fossils. Assuming that, as in modern marine ecosystems, about 70% of the species that lived in the Early Cambrian seas are unsuitable for fossilization, he estimated that the shelly fossils probably represent about 2% of the animals that were alive at the time. Since these shelly fossils are found {{in other parts of}} North America and, in many cases, over <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>wider</b> range, the Burgess Shale fossils, including the soft-bodied ones, probably show how much diversity could be expected at other sites if Burgess Shale type preservation were found there.|$|E
5|$|In 212, the constitutio Antoniniana (Antonine decree) of emperor Caracalla granted Roman {{citizenship}} {{to all the}} free inhabitants of the Empire– the peregrini– thus abolishing their second-class status. But {{there is no evidence}} that the citizens-only rule for legions was also abolished at this time. The legions simply gained <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>wider</b> recruitment base, as they were now able to recruit any male free resident of the empire. Auxiliary units were now recruited mainly from Roman citizens, but probably continued to recruit non-citizen barbari from outside the Empire's borders. However, the citizens-only rule for legions appears to have been dropped some time during the 3rd century, as by the 4th-century Romans and barbarians are found serving together in all units.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the revolution of 1905, Tsar Nicholas II accepted a series of liberal reforms in his October Manifesto, after which Lenin felt it safe to return to St. Petersburg. Joining {{the editorial board of}} Novaya Zhizn ("New Life"), a radical legal newspaper run by Maria Andreyeva, he used it to discuss issues facing the RSDLP. He encouraged the party to seek out <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>wider</b> membership, and advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing both to be necessary for a successful revolution. Recognising that membership fees and donations from a few wealthy sympathisers were insufficient to finance the Bolsheviks' activities, Lenin endorsed the idea of robbing post offices, railway stations, trains, and banks. Under the lead of Leonid Krasin, a group of Bolsheviks began carrying out such criminal actions, the best known taking place in June 1907, when a group of Bolsheviks acting under the leadership of Joseph Stalin committed an armed robbery of the State Bank in Tiflis, Georgia.|$|E

Perry promoted the third option and Arthur Meighen, the acting Minister for Justice, therefore proposed merging the mounted police and the Dominion Police, placing them under Perry's command.
