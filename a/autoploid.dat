40|$|Meiotic {{chromosome}} behaviour in {{the genus}} Rubus is relatively normal Polyploidy occurs in both South African subgenera, i. e. Eubatus and Idaeobatus. The subgenus Eubatus contains plants tending mostly towards autoploidy. whereas the subgenus  Idaeobatus varies from <b>autoploid,</b> through segmental alloploid to alloploid. It is concluded that this apparent difference {{might be due}} to the study of a statistically insufficient number of plants and that alloploidy originated from imersubgeneric hybridization. </p...|$|E
40|$|Taxonomy. —Shadscale {{includes}} several chromosome races ranging from diploid (2 n = 2 x = 18) to decaploid (2 n = 10 x = 90). Plant similarities and {{the paucity of}} close relatives suggest that these races are largely <b>autoploid</b> (Stutz and Sanderson 1983). Of all the races, tetraploids are most common (Sanderson and others 1990). Generally, polyploid populations occur in uniform stands at lower elevations and on valley floors while diploid forms occur on uplands in more diverse communities and are usually larger in stature (Sanderson and others 1990, Stutz and Sanderson 1983).

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The Artemisia ludoviciana {{polyploid}} {{complex is}} a highly polymorphic assembledge of eight taxa in the Pacific Northwest, with a chromosome base number of x= 9. A cytogenetic analysis of this complex was carried out to determine the sources of its variation, the types of polyploidy present, and the genetic processes active in its evolution. Chromosome counts in the complex disclosed two diploid taxa, A. michauxiana and A. cavaticaulis, {{in addition to the}} previously counted diploids, A. suksdorfii and A. lindleyana. Results of meiotic analysis and artificial hybridization experiments strongly suggested the <b>autoploid</b> origin of the polyploid members of the complex. These results included the constancy of multivalent formation among the polyploids, the maximum number of multivalents formed in each taxon, the pairing relationships of the hexaploid and trisomic hexaploid A. douglasiana, the degree of homology between the included genomes of the artificial hybrids, and the presence of heteroploidy in at least five of the included taxa. The attributes of the complex that might have contributed to the origin and success of autoploidy were also examined. Observations indicate that the diploids produce a low but constant number of unreduced pollen grains. Introgression from the diploid to the tetraploid level, through tetraploid progeny, provides a source of variation for the newly formed autoploids. The complex has a broad physiological base. Mechanisms are present in the meiotic apparatus that could allow for an increase in fertility of <b>autoploid</b> individuals. The phylogenetic and taxonomic relationships among several of the taxa are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The genus  Rubus L. is {{represented}} in southern Africa by the subgenera  Eubatus Focke and  Idaeobatus Focke. A combination o f morphological data, data on the reproductive systems of some collections and meiotic chromosome behaviour indicates that a hybrid swarm in the eastern Transvaal was formed subsequent to the hybridization between R. cuneifolius Pursh. taxon B (subgenus Eubatus) and R. longepedicellatus (C. E. Gust.) C. H. Stirton (subgenus Idaeobatus). Other examples of intra- and intersubgeneric hybridization were found during this study of the South African material. These instances, with examples found in the literature, indicate that the subgeneric subdivisions of Rubus are artificial. Three different methods were used to analyse the meiotic chromosome configurations. The genome relationship system of Alonso & Kimber (1981) and Kimber & Alonso (1981) and the modification of the binomial system of Jackson & Casey (1980) by Spies (1984) {{proved to be the}} most sensitive for distinguishing between alio-, segmental alio- and <b>autoploids.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Ipomoea fnfida (H. B. K.) DON. forms a {{polyploid}} complex with a {{range from}} diploid to hexaploid. The synthesized hexaploids (SH, 2 n= 6 x= 90) with I. trlfida d{ploid (K 221, 2 n = 2 x= 30) and tetraplold (K 233, 2 n= 4 x= 60) have been considered {{to have the same}} genomic structure (B 1 B 1 B 2 B 2 B 2 B 2) as the sweet potato (SP, 2 n= 6 x= 90). To determine the genomic structure of the derived hexaploids (DH) frorn intercrosses of I. trzfida triploid (K 222, 2 n= 3 x= 45), and the genomic structure of I. trzfida hexaploid (K 123, 2 n= 6 x= 90), F_ 1 hybrids from DH×SH, DH×SP, SH×K 123, and DH×K 123, and their backcross (BC_ 1) and double-cross progenies have been cytologically examined. When the genomes existing in quadruplicate in the parental hexaploids are non-homologous, such non-homology may cause failure of chromosome pairing in a BC_ 1 or double-cross progeny. Meiotic analyses of these hexaploid hybrids showed almost complete chromosome pairing at the matephase I (MI), suggesting that the hexaploids DH and K 123 have the same genomic structure just as do SH and the sweet potato. Further, to clarify the genomic structure of the sweet potato and the I. tnfida hexaploids by estimating the degree of homology between the B_ 1 and B_ 2 genomes, meiotic pairing was observed in the tetraploid hybrids (B_ 1 B_ 1 B_ 2 B_ 2) from DH×K 221 and tetraploid hybrids (B_ 1 B_ 2 B_ 2 B_ 2) from (DH×K 221) ×K 233. Both tetraploid hybrlds demonstrated a reasonable frequency of tetravalents to support the autoploidy of their genomic constitution. These results led {{to the conclusion that the}} sweet potato and the I trifida hexaploids are <b>autoploids</b> with respect to the B genome of the I. trlfida diploid (K 221). The use of wild germplasm of I. trtfida to incorporate its valuable traits into cultivars was undertaken and 'has brought some remarkable results in sweet potato breeding. A significant role of the autoploidy in possible gene flow through inter- and intraploidy hybridization between the sweet potato and I. trlfida was discussed. サツマイモに最も近縁な種Ipomoea trifidaは二倍体から六倍体をふくむ倍数体複合種である.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Chromosome counts were {{determined}} for 152 accessions of Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) A. Löve and, combined with existing count data, used to plot {{the distribution of}} diploid and tetraploid populations. Morphological variation of 55 characters was examined in five groups totaling 205 operational taxonomic units (OTU's), using cluster, principal factor, and discriminant analyses. The five groups included diploid and autotetraploid spicata, an allotetraploid previously included in spicata, a control group including four Old World Pseudoroegneria species, and a small control sample of Elymus lanceolatus (Scrib. and Smith) Gould. The analyses {{were not able to}} separate diploid from <b>autoploid</b> spicata nor identify any clear sub-groupings within the diploids. However, the alloploid was separated from spicata and aligned with Elymus lanceolatus based on glume and spike characters. This study recommends the alloploid be included in lanceolatus as a new subspecies, Elymus lanceolatus ssp. wawawai. The chromosome count data indicate it is distributed in the canyons and tributaries of the lower Salmon and Snake Rivers of northern Idaho, northeastern Oregon, and southeastern Washington. The new subspecies keys to Elymus lanceolatus based on glume characters and is separated from subspecies lanceolatus and albicans by its cespitose growth habit...|$|E
40|$|Fairway crested wheatgrass, {{which is}} {{identified}} taxonomically as Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. (45), A. cristatiforme (38), or A. pectiniforme Roem. and Schult (22), is an economically important range grass {{belonging to the}} 2 ̆ 2 crested wheatgrass complex 2 ̆ 2 (24, 38). The crested wheatgrass complex includes diploid, 2 n = 14, tetraploid, 2 n = 28, and hexaploid, 2 n = 42, forms (1, 11, 22). The variety Fairway and Fairway-like derivatives are the only known diploid members of the species complex (24, 38). Meiotic chromosome behavior of Fairway diploids appears to be typical of other diploid species; however, the number of plants examined cytologically has been relatively small. Although Fairway crested wheatgrass is a good seed producer, interplant variation in fertility is high (13, 22, 25, 42). Irregular chromosome behavior is a common source of sterility and may be contributing to the variable seed set in diploid crested wheatgrass. No information is available concerning the relation of meiotic chromosome behavior to fertility in Fairway crested wheatgrass. Polyploid crested wheatgrasses are {{generally considered to be}} of <b>autoploid</b> origin, i. e., they are derived by duplication of the chromosome complement of a diploid prototype. Chromosome pairing in the polyploid species (31), in interspecific hybrids (12), and in polyhaploid plants (11) substantiate the <b>autoploid</b> derivation of polyploid crested wheatgrass. Diploid and tetraploid forms of crested wheatgrass have been hybridized by Knowles (24), and chromosome pairing in the hybrids suggest a close relation between the diploid and tetraploid genomes. Colchicine-induced tetraploids of Fairway crested wheatgrass have been produced by Knowles, 1 and these artificial tetraploids are currently being utilized in his crested wheatgrass breeding program. If the full breeding and cytogenetic potentials of diploid crested wheatgrass are to be realized, the meiotic chromosome behavior and the cytotaxonomic status of this species must be fully understood. The present investigation was designed to provide further information concerning the cytogenetic characteristics of Fairway crested wheatgrass and its autotetraploid derivatives. This investigation was established with the following objectives: 1. To examine meiotic chromosome behavior of Fairway crested wheatgrass. 2. To determine the relation of meiotic chromosome behavior to fertility in Fairway crested wheatgrass. 3. To evaluate the effectiveness of several colchicine treatments in doubling the chromosome complement of Fairway crested wheatgrass. 4. To determine the effect of induced polyploidy on plant morphology in colchicine-induced tetraploids of Fairway crested wheatgrass. 5. To determine the meiotic chromosome behavior and fertility of induced tetraploids of Fairway crested wheatgrass...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Comparative {{analyses}} {{were made of}} agamo-spermous populations of Eupatorium sessilifolium, which have previously been documented to be polyploid, {{to determine whether they}} are alloploid or <b>autoploid</b> in origin and to assess the possibility that they have arisen more than once. There was no variability in ITS sequences among seven agamospermous and eight sexual diploid populations of E. sessilifolium, which is consistent with morphological observations in suggesting that the agamospermous popu-lations were autoploids. The ITS sequence characteristic of E. sessilifolium differs from all other North American species by a minimum of 15 changes, and heterogeneity or polymorphism would be expected if the agamospermous populations were alloploids. Analysis of the chloroplast-based trnC-psbM spacer region showed variability among both sexual diploid and agamospermous populations of E. sessilifolium, which suggested that the agamospermous populations stem from multiple origins. Analysis of ISSR data revealed considerable intraspecific variability within E. sessilifolium, and the distribution of variability, with agamospermous populations showing variability from one another, added further evidence for multiple origins of agamospermous populations. The results in conjunction with distributional evidence that the sexual diploid popu-lations of E. sessilifolium are geographically restricted and uncommon suggest that monitoring of populations might be warranted to evaluate whether measures are needed to enhance their continued survival...|$|E
40|$|The genus Gynostemma (Cucurbitaceae) {{constitutes}} a polyploid group of perennial creeping herbs, in whose evolution polyploidization {{is a key}} component. With the largest variety of cytotypes (2 n = 22, 44, 66 and 88) in Gynostemma, G. pentaphyllum {{is also the most}} widespread species in this genus. In the present study, we inferred the origins of polyploids in G. pentaphyllum using sequences of the plastid intergenic spacers (trnL–trnF, psbB–psbF and rpl 20 –rps 12) and cloned DNA sequences from two nuclear regions (RPB 2 and nrDNA ITS). Phylogenetic analyses of the separate and the combined nuclear gene datasets all supported <b>autoploid</b> origins of polyploids in G. pentaphyllum. Three polyploid populations were more closely related, indicating that significant genetic differentiation may have occurred between diploids and polyploids. We concluded that polyploidization might be an important evolutionary mechanism in the diversification of G. pentaphyllum. On the other hand, no chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation was detected in ingroups except the octoploid DL 8 x, which possessed a different cpDNA haplotype from the other populations of G. pentaphyllum. This can be explained by limited sample sizes, possible extinction of its diploid progenitors and/or the occurrence of chloroplast transfer through hybridization with other Gynostemma species. However, the distribution of cytotypes in G. pentaphyllum was not as typical as many other autopolyploid complexes. Polyploidization failed to contribute significantly to the expansion of its geographic range. The geographic distribution of diploids and polyploids in G. pentaphyllum may be associated with the past ecological environments of different areas, especially during the glacial period...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 A cytogeographical {{study was}} made of populations of {{tetraploid}} (n= 18) and hexaploid (n= 27) Achillea millefolium (Compositae- Anthemideae) from the Pacific Coast states. There is a complex distributional pattern, involving overlapping ranges, mixed populations, migration of one form into areas occuplied by the other, pentaploid hybrids, and septaploid and octoploid plants. The distributions of the coastal tetraploids {{in the areas of}} southwestern Oregon, northwestern California, and northwestern Washington, are correlated with the distinctive geological regions of the Klamath and the Olympic Mountains. Tetraploid plants of these areas frequently produce unreduced micros pores with a chromosome number of n= 36. On the basis of these observations, several inferences are advanced. First, the distributions of the two chromosome forms are not static, but rather dynamic, with man being instrumental in dispersal and establishment of Achillea populations. Second, the North American hexaploid is indigenous, having its origins in the tetraploid through the union of unreduced or tetraploid gametes with normal diploid gametes. Evidence for this hypothesis is found in the reproductive barriers between American and Eurasian hexaploids; the meiotic configurations of the pentaploid hybrids; the existence of mixed populations in which single hexaploid plants occur among tetraploids that are producing unreduced gametes; and the morphological and ecological similarities indicative of an <b>autoploid</b> system of evolution. From the distributional patterns detected, it is believed that the tetraploid, established during Tertiary times in the Klamath and Olympic Mountains, gave rise to the hexaploids at the geological margins of these areas. Due to these observations and the complete intergrading morphological variation characterizing the genus, it is suggested that Achillea in western North America is adequately and meaningfully described as a single species, highly polymorphic and with two or more ploidy levels...|$|E
