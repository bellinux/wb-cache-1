5000|$|Fillet welding {{notation}} {{is important}} to recognize when reading blueprints. The use of this notation tells the welder exactly what is expected from the manufacturer. The symbol for a fillet weld is {{in the shape of a}} triangle. This triangle will lay either below a flat line or above it with an arrow coming off of the flat line pointing to a joint. The flat line is called [...] "reference line". The side on which the triangle symbol is placed is important because it gives an indication on which side of the joint is to be intersected by the weld. It is recognized that there are two different approaches in the global market to designate the arrow side and other side on drawings; a description of the two approaches is contained in International Standard ISO 2553, they are called [...] "A-System" [...] (which is more commonly used in Europe) and [...] "B-System" [...] (which is basically the ANSI/AWS system used in the US). In [...] "A-System" [...] two parallel lines are used as reference line: one is a continuous line, the other is a dashed line. In the [...] "B-System", there is only one reference line, which is a continuous line. If there is a single reference line (B-System) and the triangle is positioned below the line, then the weld is going to be on the arrow side. If there is a single reference line ("B-System") and the triangle is positioned above the line, then the weld is going to be on the opposite side of the arrow.When you find an arrow pointing to a joint with two triangles, one sitting below and one sitting above the line even with each other, then there is intended to be a fillet weld on the arrow side of the joint as well as the opposite side of the joint. If the weld is to be continuous around a piece of metal such as a pipe or square, then a small circle will be around the point where the flat line and arrow pointing to the joint are connected. Manufacturers also include the strength that the weld must be. This is indicated by a letter and number combination just before the flat line. Examples of this are [...] "E70" [...] meaning the <b>arc</b> <b>electrode</b> must have a tensile strength of [...] There are also symbols that describe the aesthetics of the weld. A gentle curve pointing away from the hypotenuse means a concave weld is required, a straight line parallel with the hypotenuse calls for a flat faced weld, and a gentle curve towards the hypotenuse calls for a convex weld. The surface of the weld can be manipulated either by welding technique or by use of machining or grinding tools after the weld is completed. When reading a manufacturers blueprints, you might also come across weld dimensions. The weld can be sized in many different ways such as the length of the weld, the measurements of the legs of the weld, and the spaces between welds. Along with a triangle, there will usually be a size for the weld for example (”x”) to the left of the triangle. This means that the vertical leg of the weld is to be ” whereas the horizontal leg is to ”. To the right of the triangle, there will be a measurement of exactly how long the weld is supposed to be.If the measurements of the drawing are in mm the welds are likewise measured in mm. For example, the weld would be 3 x 10, the mm being understood automatically.|$|E

In order to further improve the welding productivity, the normal solid tungsten electrode {{is replaced by a}} kind of coupling <b>arc</b> <b>electrode.</b> The changes of arc pressure distribution along anode surface and the weld appearance were evaluated. On this basis, the dependences of weld shape characterized with weld depth, width and undercut on the main welding parameters were discussed. The results indicate, the substitution of coupling <b>arc</b> <b>electrode</b> can lead to an obvious decrease of arc pressure. Compared to hollow tungsten electrode and twin tungsten electrodes, the coupling <b>arc</b> <b>electrode</b> is much easier to manufacture and has more compacter structure.

30|$|In this study, a novel {{variation}} of activated TIG welding method called Gas Pool Coupled Activating TIG (GPCA-TIG) welding with coupling <b>arc</b> <b>electrode</b> is put forward to actualize a TIG welding process simultaneously with deep penetration and high welding speed. This process {{is based on}} a specialized double layers gas shielded TIG welding method named GPCA-TIG welding [32] developed in-house. The inner inert shielding gas is to prevent tungsten electrode from oxidation. The outer pure/mixing gas contains oxygen and/or nitrogen elements. Oxygen is introduced to dramatically increase weld depth, while nitrogen to improve weld quality. The relative position between the outer and inner convergent nozzles, simplified as a variable h named coupling degree, can be changed to adjust the coupled area and position between the outer activating gas and molten pool surface and control the weld shape and properties. The kind of coupling <b>arc</b> <b>electrode</b> was developed in-house to decrease arc pressure by cutting the tip of normal solid clubbed tungsten into four identical parts. Through analyzing the arc pressure and the influences of welding parameter on weld appearance, the feasibility of this process is discussed in this paper.|$|E
40|$|Modelling of the arc in {{electric}} arc welding is significant to achieve a better pro-cess understanding, thus gain better weld quality and a more efficient production process.

Also the 3 wt % Ni weld metals were bainitic/martensitic but with relative fractions being strongly cooling rate dependent. Similar strength and toughness were measured for both types of weld metals at intermediate cooling rates (∆t 8 / 5 ≈ 10 s).

40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{performed}} {{on the effect of}} plasma aerodynamic actuation on a round jet in cross flow field with a low Reynolds number by using smoke visualization. The actuator is constituted by an electrode pair separated by a dielectric Al 2 O 3 sheet. Several AC supply conditions are utilized. The experimental result shows a closing-in tendency of the jet flow toward the wall after being induced by plasma aerodynamic actuation, and such tendency is increasingly intensified as the actuation voltage increases. Numerical simulation is also performed. The simulation results show that an induced vortex pair is generated by plasma aerodynamic actuation near the wall flow field. The rotation direction of the induced vortex pair reverses against the counter-rotating vortex pair generated by a round jet in a cross flow without plasma aerodynamic actuation. Then the strength and structural size of the counter-rotating vortex pair are significantly reduced, resulting in the intensified near-wall effect of the jet flow. Three electrode-typed actuators (straight, 150 °-elliptic arc and 180 °-elliptic arc with the same streamwise extent) are placed at the exit of round jet to research the influence of electrode structure on jet in cross flow.

40|$|Although many {{methods are}} {{available}} for production of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), the conventional carbon arc process remains the most popular due to its simplicity and large production rate. However, high temperatures inside the carbon arc generate strong buoyancy driven convection, and it is hypothesized that the non-uniform environment created by this flow will have large effects on the growth and morphology of SWNTs produced by the arc process. Indeed, using normal gravity experiments, Marin et al. have demonstrated that changes in the buoyant convection plume produced by altering the <b>arc</b> <b>electrode</b> orientation {{can be used to}} change the diameter distribution of the SWNTs produced; an effect they attribute to changes in the temperature of the local nanotube growth environment. While these experiments present convincing evidence that buoyant convection has a strong effect on nanotube growth, normal gravity experiments are severely limited in scope. The ideal way to study the effect of buoyancy on SWNT production is to remove it completely. Toward this goal, a microgravity carbon arc reactor has been designed for use in the NASA Glenn 2. 2 and 5 second drop towers. Although simple in principle, conventional carbon arc machines, which generally employ large reaction chambers and require heavy duty welding power supplies capable of supplying kilowatts of power, are not suitable for microgravity experiments. Here we describe a miniature carbon arc machine for SWNT production that fits into a conventional drop rig for use on the NASA Glenn 2. 2 and 5 second drop towers, but that has a performance (production rate) that is better than most large ground-based machines...|$|E
40|$|The project {{consisted}} of two parts: (1) the cathode interaction studies which were a continuation of previous work and had the objective of increasing {{our understanding of the}} microscopic phenomena controlling cathode erosion in arc jet thrusters, and (2) the studies of the anode attachment in arc jet thrusters. The cathode interaction studies {{consisted of}} (1) a continuation of some modeling work in which the previously derived model for the cathode heating was applied to some specific gases and electrode materials, and (2) experimental work in which various diagnostics was applied to the cathode. The specific diagnostics used were observation of the cathode tip during arcing using a Laser Strobe Video system in conjunction with a tele-microscope, a monochromator with an optical multichannel analyzer for the determination of the cathode temperature distribution, and various ex situ materials analysis methods. The emphasis of our effort was shifted to the cathode materials analysis because a parallel project was in place {{during the second half of}} 1993 with a visiting scientist pursuing <b>arc</b> <b>electrode</b> materials studies. As a consequence, the diagnostic investigations of the arc in front of the cathode had to be postponed to the first half of 1994, and we are presently preparing these measurements. The results of last year's study showed some unexpected effects influencing the cathode erosion behavior, such as increased erosion away from the cathode tip, and our understanding of these effects should improve our ability to control cathode erosion. The arc jet anode attachment studies concentrated on diagnostics of the instabilities in subsonic anode attachment arc jet thrusters, and were supplemental measurements to work which was performed by one of the authors who spent the summer as an intern at NASA Lewis Research Center.
