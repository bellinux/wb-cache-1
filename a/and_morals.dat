In order to justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity Jupiter, perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill.

5|$|In {{addition}} to his many other roles, the emperor acted as the highest priest in the land who made sacrifices to Heaven, the main deities known as the Five Powers, and the spirits (shen 神) of mountains and rivers.

5|$|A {{major source}} of income was the export of wool.

The internal discipline <b>and</b> <b>morals</b> of the community declined too: in 1400–01 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region. However, things improved {{in the fifteenth century}} and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots, better management, access to new resources (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.|$|E
5|$|During the Qin dynasty, {{the first}} Qin emperor's {{legitimacy}} to rule was ultimately decided by {{his ability to}} conquer others. However, {{by the time of}} Wang Mang's (r. 9–23 AD) reign, the Mandate of Heaven was considered the only legitimate source of imperial authority. This concept was given greater prominence after the state officially sponsored the worship of Heaven over that of the Five Powers in 31 BC. Moreover, the philosophy of the scholar Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC), which held that a dynasty's rule on earth was bound to greater cosmological cycles in the universe, was officially sponsored by the Han court from Emperor Wu's (r. 141–87 BC) reign onward. The emperor was expected to behave according to proper ritual, ethics, <b>and</b> <b>morals,</b> lest he incur the wrath of Heaven and bring an end to his reign. He became the highest priest in the land. By performing certain religious rites and rituals, the emperor acted as a sacred link between Heaven and Earth.|$|E
5|$|In 1836, Walter Savage Landor, an English {{writer and}} poet, {{published}} Pericles and Aspasia, {{one of his}} most famous books. Pericles and Aspasia is a rendering of classical Athens through a series of imaginary letters, which contain numerous poems. The letters are frequently unfaithful to actual history but attempt to capture the spirit of the Age of Pericles. Robert Hamerling is another novelist and poet who was inspired by Aspasia's personality. In 1876 he published his novel Aspasia, a book about the manners <b>and</b> <b>morals</b> of the Age of Pericles and a work of cultural and historical interest. Giacomo Leopardi, an Italian poet influenced by the movement of romanticism, published a group of five poems known as the circle of Aspasia. These Leopardi poems were inspired by his painful experience of desperate and unrequited love for a woman named Fanny Targioni Tozzetti. Leopardi called this person Aspasia, after the companion of Pericles.|$|E

40|$|Children's {{emerging}} morality {{involves the}} development of <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition. Developmental research suggests that emotions {{play an important role}} in dealing with <b>moral</b> conflict situations, <b>and</b> they help children differentiate moral concepts from other social judgments. However, emotions and their role in <b>moral</b> cognition <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> behavior have yet to be addresses systematically in empirical research. In this volume, the authors show how integrative developmental research on children's <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition can help us understand how children's morality evolves. As both <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition are related to children's moral, prosocial behavior, as well as to their immoral, aggressive behavior, studying how <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition interact is not only of conceptual significance to developmental researchers, but also of practical importance to educators. A central premise of the volume is that moral emotions interact with moral cognition in different ways across development. An integrative developmental perspective on <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition thus offers an important conceptual framework for understanding children's emerging morality and designing developmentally sensitive moral intervention strategies. The authors summarize the empirical literature linking moral emotions to <b>moral</b> cognition <b>and</b> discuss promising conceptual avenues and methodological approaches to study children's <b>moral</b> emotions <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> cognition.

5|$|Political realism {{formed the}} basis of Kennan's work as a diplomat and {{historian}} and remains relevant to the debate over American foreign policy, which since the 19th century has been characterized by a shift from the Founding Fathers' realist school to the idealistic or Wilsonian school of international relations. According to the realist tradition, security is based on the principle of a balance of power, whereas Wilsonianism (considered impractical by realists) relies on morality as the sole determining factor in statecraft. According to the Wilsonians the spread of democracy abroad as a foreign policy is important <b>and</b> <b>morals</b> are valid universally. During the Presidency of Bill Clinton, American diplomacy represented the Wilsonian school {{to such a degree that}} those in favor of the realism likened President Clinton's policies to social work.
