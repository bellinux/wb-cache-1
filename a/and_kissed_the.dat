25|$|After Sigismund III {{was elected}} in 1587, Elizabeth's {{intelligence}} service gave notice that an ambassador was in transit and that the deputation was one of amity. On 23 July 1587, the Privy Council instructed the Lord Mayor of London to arrange housing for the diplomat, preferably with a merchant prominent in the Baltic trade. To ensure Elizabeth would not find fault with the preparations, the Lord Mayor was to report the arrangements made. Two days later a Polish envoy, Paweł Działyński, arrived at the palace in Greenwich. Brought to the reception hall, he found Elizabeth sitting on the throne under the canopy of state with all her nobles in attendance. The ambassador presented his credentials, <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>the</b> Queen's hand extended to him―a gesture of royal favour. Działyński then strode to {{the centre of the}} chamber without any forewarning of what he was about to say, and, instead of the oration of a legate that everyone anticipated, he couched in respectful words to flatter the monarch being addressed and spoke as a herald. In Latin, he hectored, admonished and criticized the queen, and declared an ultimatum of capitulation to terms or hostile action.|$|E

In Beiste's fourth appearance, for the episode entitled [...] "Never Been Kissed", the character's storyline was met with criticism, though the acting of Jones was not. Reiter questioned why Beiste was made to look to {{high school students to}} [...] "gauge her own desirability", an element she found [...] "hazy and creepy". James Poniewozik of Time criticized the depiction of Beiste as an object of pity, and felt that Will's behavior was worse than the students' when he acted with [...] "amazing condescension" [...] <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>the</b> coach. Both Poniewozik and MTV's Aly Semigran disliked the way viewers were made complicit in Beiste's humiliation by being invited to laugh at the character's expense, and Linda Holmes of NPR criticized Glee for denying Beiste dignity, with the observation that such a plot would never have been given to Kurt. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented negatively on the way Glee plays up Beiste's [...] "masculine nature" [...] while simultaneously lecturing viewers against mocking Beiste. He called the kiss [...] "somehow both heartfelt and completely horrifying". IGN's Robert Canning praised Jones in her [...] "best performance this season", as well as Beiste's [...] "raw and real" [...] confession to Will.|$|E

2500|$|According to Rosemarie Bodenheimer, North and South {{narrative}} {{may sometimes}} appear melodramatic and sentimental ("But, for all that—for all his savage words, {{he could have}} thrown himself at her feet, <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>the</b> hem of her garment" [...] in chapter 29)—particularly in the riot scene—but she sees Gaskell's best writing as [...] "done with the unjudging openness to experience" [...] Which the author shares with D. H. Lawrence (Bodenheimar 1979, pp.296–300). Jill L. Matus finds Gaskell's vocabulary [...] "Gothicized" [...] in its descriptions of the characters' agonised inner life—their responses to suffering and pain—which may appear melodramatic out of context. [...] However, [...] "the language of shock and horror is absorbed into the realist texture of the novel's narration" [...] and {{is consistent with the}} extreme conditions of the novel's external world (Matus, 2007, p.39).|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Simeon the Just was so {{skeptical of}} the reasons for which nazirites might have {{interrupted}} their status that he found only one that he really trusted. He said that only once in his life had he eaten of the trespass-offering brought by a defiled tear in connection with an interrupted nazirite vow. On that occasion a nazirite came from the South country, and Simeon the Just saw that he had beautiful eyes, was of handsome appearance, and with thick locks of hair symmetrically arranged. Simeon the Just asked him what reason the nazirite had seen to destroy this beautiful hair by shaving it for the nazirite vow. The nazirite replied that he was a shepherd for his father and once he went to draw water from a well and gazed upon his reflection in the water, and his evil desires rushed upon him and sought to drive him from the world through sin. But the shepherd swore that day that he would shave his beautiful hair off for the sake of Heaven. Simeon the Just immediately arose <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>the</b> nazirite's head, praying that there would be many nazirites such as him in Israel. And Simeon the Just said that it was of this nazirite that [...] says, [...] "When either {{a man or a woman}} shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a nazirite, to separate themselves unto the Lord ..." [...] Rabbi Mani inquired why Simeon the Just did not eat of the guilt-offering of a nazirite. If it was because the nazirite was a sinner because he tormented himself, depriving himself of wine, that would be inconsistent with ever eating of the sin-offering (for example) for tasting forbidden fat or of the sin-offering for tasting blood. Simeon the Just thought that people made the nazirite vow in a fit of temper, and since they vowed in a fit of temper they would ultimately come to regret it. And once they regretted it, their sacrifices become like those of people who slaughtered unconsecrated animals in the Temple court (which would be disrespectful and forbidden). This nazirite, however, vowed after due mental deliberation and his mouth and heart were in agreement.|$|E

2500|$|India {{entered the}} final day with ten wickets in hand and a further 193 runs to get. Should they win the match, it would be their first in Australian soil in 23 years, {{moreover}} such a result {{would mean that the}} Australians would have lost their first home test match in five years. As the openers walked out on a bright and sunny morning. The morning sessions was intense and tension-filled, as the Australian bowlers, led by Gillespie, did not let the opening pair to settle down as they did the previous morning. The opening pair only added 11 runs to the score in five overs, before Gillespie nailed Chopra when the score was 48. Dravid, the next man in, was welcomed with a tremendous round of applause from the Australian crowd. However, the welcome he received from the Australian bowlers was less than warm. When he was batting on 9, Dravid edged a delivery in the offstump line from the injured Brad Williams to Gilchrist, who could not take a low and difficult chance. However, Dravid was once again given a thorough working over from Williams. The reprieve would ultimately prove to be costly. Had the wicket fallen, it would have been 73/2, but the second wicket did not get delayed much after that drop. Virender Sehwag had smashed a four off Stuart MacGill, but almost immediately, a couple of balls later, he got out MacGill, who dropped in a well-flighted delivery, luring Sehwag to step put of the crease and have a go at it, which resulted in his stumping. Then the score was 79/2. Sachin Tendulkar, coming at the fall of the second wicket was under immense pressure as he had only scored a meagre 171 runs at an average of 19 in five tests that he played since December 2002. His sequence of scores in those tests were:8, 51, 9, 32, 8, 7, 55, 1, 0 and 1. However, in this innings, Tendulkar started well, starting with a paddle-sweep for four of MacGill, and then he played some handsome cover-drives and unleashed his pulls whenever the bowlers seemed to have erred in line and length. He played patiently as well, not allowing the momentum to drop, but also not allowing aggression to get the better of him. His running was also prolific, as he ran three runs and on one occasion, he even ran four runs. Dravid, on the other end, played slowly and assuredly, with his runs coming mainly from solid batting rather than aggressive or flamboyant strokeplay. The duo added 50 runs within a span of 14.2 overs, when Dravid scored two runs off a delivery from Steve Waugh. Brad Williams came back for a second spell and tested the two batsmen severely with his reverse swing and limited pace. The partnership blossomed to 70, and just when it seemed that the two would bat Australia out of the game, Stuart MacGill struck with Tendulkar's wicket in the 47th over. MacGill, who had been until then, bowling from round the wicket, changed the angle and Tendulkar, failing to read a straighter one which pitched on middle-and-leg, offered no stroke and was given out lbw for a 59-ball 37, and the score was 149/3. Sourav Ganguly joined Dravid in the middle. The two added 21 runs from 9 overs before Ganguly was dismissed by Andy Bichel for 12, scooping a drive straight to Simon Katich. At 170/4, India required 60 runs more and Australia were smelling blood, and were back into the contest. Laxman walked out once again, to join Dravid, and he swung back the momentum of the match promptly. After scoring his first run off his first ball, Laxman was back on strike in the 57th over. He dead-batted the first two balls, but he caressed the third ball through covers, a full toss (by MacGill) to the boundary. When MacGill repeated that the next ball, Laxman sent it back to the midwicket boundary. Then he cut the last ball to the point boundary, taking 12 runs from the over. The next over, Dravid reached a well-deserved fifty from 129 balls, with a four off Andy Bichel. Thus, he completed the distinction of being the only man to reach two fifty-plus scores in the match. Dravid too, grew in confidence, and began to repeat his partner's exploits. Soon after the two had added 51 from 11 overs, Laxman was dismissed playing a rash stroke, mistiming a hoick off Katich to Bichel, but the match was already lost by then and at 221/4, India needed only 9 runs to clinch the match. Parthiv Patel delayed the moment, getting bowled around the legs by Katich, but it brought together India's two heroes with the bat an ball, Rahul Dravid and Ajit Agarkar to the crease. In the fourth ball of the 72nd over and with the score on 229/6, Dravid played a square cut, which went away to the boundary, and as he ran, he let out a roar and pumped his fist. Then he took off his cap <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>the</b> India crest on it. Steve Waugh, in a brave act of sportsmanship, gave Dravid the ball which he had cut for four, saying [...] "Well Played." ...|$|E
