5|$|In Eurasia, many {{gray wolf}} populations {{are forced to}} subsist largely on {{livestock}} and garbage in areas with dense human activity, though wild ungulates such as moose, red deer, roe deer and wild boar are still the most important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. Other prey species include reindeer, <b>argali,</b> mouflon, wisent, saiga, ibex, chamois, wild goats, fallow deer and musk deer. The prey animals of North American wolves have largely continued to occupy suitable habitats with low human density, and cases of wolves subsisting largely on garbage or livestock are exceptional. Animals preferred as prey by North American wolves include moose, white-tailed deer, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, Dall's sheep, American bison, muskox and caribou.|$|E
5|$|The urial (O. vignei) {{was once}} {{thought to have been}} a forebear of {{domestic}} sheep, as they occasionally interbreed with mouflon in the Iranian part of their range. However, the urial, <b>argali</b> (O. ammon), and snow sheep (O. nivicola) have a different number of chromosomes than other Ovis species, making a direct relationship implausible, and phylogenetic studies show no evidence of urial ancestry. Further studies comparing European and Asian breeds of sheep showed significant genetic differences between the two. Two explanations for this phenomenon have been posited. The first explanation is that a currently unknown species or subspecies of wild sheep that contributed to the formation of domestic sheep. The second explanation is that this variation is the result of multiple waves of capture from wild mouflon, similar to the known development of other livestock.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009, the Altaigate Scandal {{developed}} {{after the}} Plenipotentiary of the Russian President in the State Duma was killed along with 6 other {{officials in the}} helicopter crash accident (poaching for legally protected <b>argali</b> mountain sheep) and an entire investigation was concealed from the public.|$|E

50|$|After the {{municipal}} elections in 2005, Aivars Aksenoks became Chairman of the City council. Deputy chairmen were Andris <b>Ārgalis,</b> Jānis Birks and Almers Ludviks (the last one replaced Juris Lujāns in summer 2005). In 2007, Jānis Birks became chairmen with Jānis Dinevičs replacing him as deputy chairman.|$|R
25|$|Wildlife {{in recent}} years has become greatly impoverished. Ungulates are few in number. <b>Argali</b> sheep are seen occasionally, as are bezoar goats and wild boars, gazelles. Predators includewolves, jackals, foxes, hyenas. Among birds klik are rarely seen and stone curlews and jacks very rarely. Reptile species are {{represented}} by the steppe tortoise, monitor lizard, boa, agam, etc.|$|E
25|$|The Mongolian {{part of the}} Tavan Bogd massif {{is within}} the Altai Tavan Bogd National Park. The park covers 6,362km². It {{includes}} the lakes Khoton, Khurgan, and Dayan. The protected area offers a home for many species of alpine animal, such as the <b>Argali</b> sheep, Ibex, Red deer, Beech marten, Moose, Snow cock, and Golden eagle.|$|E
25|$|Animals such as yaks and dzos roam {{across the}} wild Lingti plains. However, over-hunting and a {{decrease}} in food supplies has led to a large decrease in the population of the Tibetan antelope, <b>argali,</b> kiangs, musk deer, and snow leopards in these regions, reducing them to the status of endangered species. However, in the Lahaul valley, one can see ibex, brown bears, foxes and snow leopards during winter.|$|E
50|$|The Przewalski horse, {{which was}} {{completely}} extinct in the wild, has been reintroduced to the reserve. Other larger ungulates, which {{are found in}} the reserve are the goitered gazelle, and the Mongolian wild ass. Siberian ibex are common in the mountains, whereas <b>argalis</b> have become rare. The main predator is the grey wolf. Snow leopards and lynxes are rare. Smaller carnivores are the red fox, the corsac fox, the wildcat, and the Pallas cat.|$|R
50|$|The next {{municipal}} elections {{took place on}} March 9, 1997. Andris Bērziņš was elected the Chairman of the City by the new Council. On May 5, 2000 he was appointed the Prime Minister and already on May 9 the RCC elected his successor Andris <b>Ārgalis.</b> The RCC structure also underwent some changes. The Council had to elect the Chairman and two Deputy Chairmen from among its members. The number of standing committees was also reduced to nine (Security and Order Committee and Committee for Matters of Foreigners and Stateless Persons were abolished). Chairmen of the Committees formed the Council’s Board. The Riga City Council employs the Executive Director of the Riga City to whom executive boards of the city districts and the Maintenance Division of the RCC are subject.|$|R
25|$|Over 6000 animal fossil {{elements}} were discovered at the cave, representing at least 20 different species. The remains of marmot, gray wolf, red fox, bear, horse, cave hyena, wooly rhinoceros, reindeer, steppe bison, red deer, Siberian ibex and <b>argali</b> sheep were commonly found inside the cave, {{with a heavy}} presence of cave hyena and wooly rhinoceros remains. Some beaver, Panthera spelaea and red wolf remains were also discovered.|$|E
25|$|Snow leopards are {{carnivores}} {{and actively}} hunt their prey. Like many cats, {{they are also}} opportunistic feeders, eating whatever meat they can find, including carrion and domestic livestock. They can kill animals two to four times their own weight, such as the bharal, Himalayan tahr, markhor, <b>argali,</b> horse, and camel, but will readily take much smaller prey, such as hares and birds. They are capable of killing most animals in their range with the probable exception of the adult male yak. Unusually among cats, snow leopards also eat {{a significant amount of}} vegetation, including grass and twigs. Snow leopards will also hunt in pairs successfully, especially mating pairs.|$|E
25|$|The diet of {{the snow}} leopard varies across its range and with the time of year, and depends on prey availability. In the Himalayas, it preys mostly on bharals (Himalayan blue sheep), but in other {{mountain}} ranges, such as the Karakoram, Tian Shan, Altai and Tost Mountains of Mongolia, its main prey consists of Siberian ibex and <b>argali,</b> a type of wild sheep, although the latter has become rarer in some parts {{of the snow}} leopard's range. Other large animals eaten when available can include various types of wild goats and sheep (such as markhors and urials), other goat-like ruminants such as Himalayan tahr and gorals, plus deer, red panda, wild boars, and langur monkeys. Smaller prey consists of marmots, woolly hares, pikas, various rodents, and birds such as the snow cock and chukar.|$|E
25|$|Prey {{animals in}} India include chital, sambar, muntjac, mouse deer, swamp deer, wild boar, gaur, water buffalo, banteng, cattle, nilgai, goats, Indian hares, Himalayan field rats and langurs. There is one {{record of a}} pack {{bringing}} down an Indian elephant calf in Assam, despite desperate defense of the mother resulting in numerous losses to the pack. In Kashmir, they prey on markhor, and thamin in Myanmar, Malayan tapir, Sumatran serow in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula, and Javan rusa in Java. In the Tien Shan and Tarbagatai Mountains, dholes prey on Siberian ibexes, arkhar, roe deer, maral and wild boar. In the Altai and Sayan Mountains, they prey on musk deer and reindeer. In eastern Siberia, they prey on roe deer, Manchurian wapiti, wild pig, musk deer, and reindeer, while in Primorye they feed on sika deer and goral, too. In Mongolia, they prey on <b>argali</b> and rarely Siberian ibex. Like African wild dogs, but unlike wolves, dholes are not known to attack people. Dholes eat fruit and vegetable matter more readily than other canids. In captivity, they eat various kinds of grasses, herbs and leaves, seemingly for pleasure rather than just when ill. In summertime in the Tien Shan Mountains, dholes eat large quantities of mountain rhubarb. Although opportunistic, dholes have a seeming aversion to hunting cattle and their calves. Livestock predation by dholes {{has been a problem}} in Bhutan since the late 1990s, as domestic animals are often left outside to graze in the forest, sometimes for weeks at a time. Livestock stall-fed at night and grazed near homes are never attacked. Oxen are killed more often than cows, probably because they are given less protection.|$|E
25|$|The bharal or blue sheep is {{the most}} {{abundant}} mountain ungulate in the Ladakh region, {{although it is not}} found in some parts of Zangskar and Sham areas. The Asiatic ibex is a very elegant mountain goat that is distributed {{in the western part of}} Ladakh. It is the second most abundant mountain ungulate in the region with a population of about 6000 individuals. It is adapted to rugged areas where it easily climbs when threatened. The Ladakhi Urial is another unique mountain sheep that inhabits the mountains of Ladakh. The population is declining, however, and there are not more than 3000 individuals left in Ladakh. The urial is endemic to Ladakh, where it is distributed only along two major river valleys: the Indus and Shayok. The animal is often persecuted by farmers whose crops are allegedly damaged by it. Its population declined precipitously in the last century due to indiscriminate shooting by hunters along the Leh-Srinagar highway. The Tibetan <b>argali</b> or Nyan is the largest wild sheep in the world, standing 3.5 to 4 feet at the shoulder with the horn measuring 90–100cm. It is distributed on the Tibetan plateau and its marginal mountains encompassing a total area of 2.5 million km2. There is only a small population of about 400 animals in Ladakh. The animal prefers open and rolling terrain as it runs, unlike wild goats that climb into steep cliffs, to escape from predators. The endangered Tibetan antelope, known as chiru in Indian English, or Ladakhi tsos, has traditionally been hunted for its wool (shahtoosh) which is a natural fiber of the finest quality and thus valued for its light weight and warmth and as a status symbol. The wool of chiru must be pulled out by hand, a process done after the animal is killed. The fiber is smuggled into Kashmir and woven into exquisite shawls by Kashmiri workers. Ladakh is also home to the Tibetan gazelle, which inhabits the vast rangelands in eastern Ladakh bordering Tibet.|$|E

2500|$|The Swaledales as a breed {{are related}} to Scottish Blackface and Rough Fell sheep, {{both of which are}} also {{predominant}} in upland locations in the United Kingdom and noted for their ability to thrive in exposed locations. [...] Although the specific origins of the breed are unknown, a non-indigenous and exotic ancestor for the Swaledale was considered by two noted names of the eighteenth century, John Naismyth and Charles Findlater. [...] Published in 1796, Naismyth's opinion in Young's Annals of Agriculture was that the origin of the black-faced highland breeds was [...] "impossible to trace". [...] Robert Trow-Smith in his book A History of British Livestock Husbandry, 1700–1900 wrote: [...] "... it has already been suggested that this family stood outside the main stream [...] of ancient British sheep..." [...] and that the root of the Swaledale and Scottish Blackface breeds could be the <b>Argali.</b> [...] This tenuous link between domestic sheep and the wild <b>Argali</b> has since been proved to be insupportable due to a significant difference in genetic make-up and number of chromosomes.|$|E
2500|$|The Marco Polo sheep (Ovis ammon polii) is a {{subspecies}} of <b>argali</b> sheep, {{named after}} Marco Polo. Their habitat is the mountainous regions of Central Asia.

2500|$|Bighorn sheep {{were once}} {{known by the}} {{scientific}} identification [...] "argali" [...] or [...] "argalia" [...] due to assumption {{that they were the}} same animal as the Asiatic <b>argali</b> (Ovis ammon). Lewis and Clark recorded numerous sightings of O. canadensis in the journals of their exploration—sometimes using the name argalia. In addition, they recorded the use of bighorn sheep by the Shoshone in making bows. William Clark's Track Map produced after the expedition in 1814 indicated a tributary of the Yellowstone River named Argalia Creek and a tributary of the Missouri River named Argalia River, both in what is today Montana. Neither of these tributaries retained these names, however. The Bighorn River, another tributary of the Yellowstone, and its tributary stream, the Little Bighorn River were both indicated on Clark's map and did retain their names, the latter being the namesake of the Battle of the Little Bighorn.|$|E
60|$|The ahsahta, <b>argali,</b> or bighorn, on the contrary, has {{short hair}} like a deer, and resembles it in shape, {{but has the}} head and horns of a sheep, and its flesh {{is said to be}} delicious mutton. The Indians {{consider}} it more sweet and delicate than any other kind of venison. It abounds in the Rocky Mountains, from the fiftieth degree of north latitude, quite down to California; generally in the highest regions capable of vegetation; sometimes it ventures into the valleys, but on the least alarm, regains its favorite cliffs and precipices, where it is perilous, if not impossible for the hunter to follow.|$|E
60|$|The bighorn is {{so named}} from its horns; which {{are of a}} great size, and twisted {{like those of a}} ram. It is called by some the <b>argali,</b> by others the ibex, though differing from both of these animals. The Mandans call it the ahsahta, a name much better than the clumsy {{appellation}} which it generally bears. It is of {{the size of a small}} elk, or large deer, and of a dun color, excepting the belly and round the tail, where it is white. In its habits it resembles the goat, frequenting the rudest precipices; cropping the herbage from their edges; and like the chamois, bounding lightly and securely among dizzy heights, where the hunter dares not venture. It is difficult, therefore, to get within shot of it. Ben Jones the hunter, however, in one of the passes of the Black Hills, succeeded in bringing down a bighorn from the verge of a precipice, the flesh of which was pronounced by the gormands of the camp to have the flavor of excellent mutton.|$|E

50|$|<b>Argali</b> are {{the largest}} species of sheep in the world. The <b>argali</b> in the {{national}} park are one of six subspecies of <b>argali</b> living in Kazakhstan. In the Karkaraly National Nature Park the highest numbers of <b>argali</b> are in the Kent Mountains and in the neighboring Beldeutas Natural Reserve.The Pallas's cat {{is the size of}} a domestic cat, but it is different from an ordinary cat it that it has a dense body with short thick legs and very thick hair. Its eyes are yellow and unlike the domestic cat, its pupils remain round when looking at bright light. This species is very rare. The population continues to decline and they are on the verge of extinction. The exact number of this species is unknown because of its secretive behavior and wide distribution.|$|E
50|$|The {{park has}} 46 species of mammals, {{including}} the wolf, red fox, corsac fox, European badger, wild boar, red deer, Siberian roe deer, moose, <b>argali,</b> Eurasian lynx, three species of bat, Pallas's cat, and many others. The <b>argali</b> and Pallas’s cat are protected under Kazakhstan’s Red Book of Protected Species.|$|E
50|$|Although {{they are}} locally {{sympatric}} with Siberian ibex, {{the two species}} have differing habitat and pasture preferences, reducing likely competition. In Tibet, the <b>argali</b> must regularly compete with other grazing species for pasture, including Tibetan antelope, bharal, Thorold's deer and wild yaks. Competition is most serious with livestock, especially domestic yak and domestic sheep, with which <b>argali</b> are frequently forced to intermingle and from which they often catch diseases and parasites. The main predator of <b>argali</b> are gray wolves, which often exploit harsh winter conditions (such as deep snow) to capture the wild sheep, though they can and do take specimens of any age or condition year around. Where not locally extirpated, snow leopards and leopards are also predators of <b>argali</b> of any age. Eurasian lynx and wolverines may seldom kill <b>argali</b> to at least the size of winter-weakened ewes. Red foxes and domestic dogs (largely those kept by sheep-herders) will prey on lambs. Cinereous vultures, lammergeiers and golden eagles have been observed circling herds of ewes with lambs in a possibly predatory manner and remains of <b>argali</b> lambs have been observed in golden eagle nests. Smaller predators, such as raptorial birds and smaller mammalian carnivores, are attacked by mother ewes, but {{in the presence of}} larger predators, the ewes quickly run away with the lambs following them.|$|E

50|$|Adult <b>argali</b> eat 16 - 19 kg of food a day. The {{vegetation}} {{preferred by}} the species varies based on elevation and area. In higher elevations, they predominantly eat grasses, sedges, and forbs. At midelevation habitats, they more regularly feed on bushes and mesophyte grasses. In the lowest ranges and the spurs of deserts, grasses and sedges again predominate, but often of different species than the high-elevation ones. In north-central Kazakhstan, sprouts, leaves, flowers, and fruits are significant to the diet all year, whereas {{they appear to}} be a rare dietary supplement over the rest of the range. Water is needed by <b>argali,</b> which is rarely a problem for animals living at high elevation, where melting snow and small waterways are regularly encountered. In drier climes, <b>argali</b> may travel several kilometers in search of water. When available, <b>argali</b> readily consume saline soil.|$|E
50|$|<b>Argali</b> are {{considered}} an endangered or threatened species throughout their entire range, {{due largely to}} habitat loss from overgrazing of domestic sheep and hunting. As the world's largest sheep, the lure to gather a trophy specimen is strong among sports-hunters. They are hunted for both their meat and their horns, used in traditional Chinese medicine, and poaching {{continues to be a}} major (and difficultly managed) problem. <b>Argali</b> have been extirpated from northeastern China, southern Siberia, and parts of Mongolia. Populations of predators such as gray wolves and snow leopards have appeared to have been negatively affected by the scarcity of <b>argali.</b>|$|E
