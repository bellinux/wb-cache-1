40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of dynamic building envelope technologies, which adapt to changing outdoor and indoor environments, {{is considered a}} crucial step towards {{the achievement of the}} nearly Zero Energy Building target. It is currently not possible to evaluate the energy saving potential of innovative adaptive transparent building envelopes in an accurate manner. This creates difficulties in selecting between competing technologies and is a barrier to systematic {{development of}} these innovative technologies. The main aim of this work is to develop a method for devising optimal <b>adaptive</b> <b>glazing</b> properties and to evaluate the energy saving potential resulting from the adoption of such a technology. The method makes use of an inverse performance-oriented approach, to minimize the total primary energy use of a building. It is applied to multiple case studies (office reference room with 4 different cardinal orientations and in three different temperate climates) in order to evaluate and optimise the performance of <b>adaptive</b> <b>glazing</b> as it responds to changing boundary conditions on a monthly and daily basis. A frequency analysis on the set of optimised adaptive properties is subsequently performed to identify salient features of ideal <b>adaptive</b> <b>glazing.</b> The results show that high energy savings are achievable by adapting the transparent part of the building envelope alone, the largest component being the cooling energy demand. As expected, the energy savings are highly sensitive to: the time scale of the adaptive mechanisms; the capability of the façade to adapt to the outdoor climatic condition; the difference between outdoor climatic condition and the comfort range. Moreover important features of the optimal thermo-optical properties are identified. Of these, {{one of the most important}} findings is that a unique optimised technology, varying its thermo-optical properties between a limited number of states could be effective in different climates and orientations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of dynamic building envelope technologies, which {{are capable of}} adapting to changing outdoor and indoor environments, is considered a crucial step towards {{the achievement of the}} nearly Zero Energy Building target. The main aim of this work is to present a method for defining the ideal/optimal range of adaptive thermo-optical performance of a glazed façades with different reaction time, in order to assess the potential of future <b>adaptive</b> <b>glazed</b> façades. This is achieved by means of a performance-oriented method, making use of single-objective optimisation, based on the minimisation of the total primary energy consumption. The method is applied to the case study of a reference office room with a fixed window-to-wall ratio in three different temperate climates. The results show that, as expected, the energy savings are inversely related to the façade reaction time. The amount of energy savings {{is a function of the}} variability of outdoor conditions and their closeness to the comfort range. The results from this study should be particularly useful for guiding future {{development of}} adaptive façade technologies...|$|R
40|$|The {{daylighting}} {{performance of}} a polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) switchable glazing has been evaluated using an unfurnished outdoor south-facing test cell with a glazing-to-wall ratio of 1 : 9. Useful daylight illuminance levels (UDI) were determined for clear sunny, intermittent cloudy and overcast cloudy days. Daylight glare indexes (DGIN) was calculated for the PDLC glazing in its transparent and translucent states. An electrically-actuated <b>adaptive</b> PDLC switchable <b>glazing</b> with transparency that varied between 27 % and 71 % was able to control daylight glare...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive {{transparent}} {{building envelope}} technologies {{could play a}} significant role in decreasing energy use in buildings and providing a more comfortable indoor environment. In order to evaluate these potentials in an economic and accurate manner, it is essential to have numerical models and simulation tools which correctly reproduce the behaviour of such components at the building level. This paper presents and discusses the empirical validation of models for thermo-tropic <b>glazing,</b> a specific <b>adaptive</b> transparent <b>glazing,</b> by means of a whole building performance simulation tool, EnergyPlus. Moreover, this study highlights the differences between two modelling approaches (EnergyPlus built-in and EMS models) and experimental data. Negligible differences are noted between the two modelling approaches, even though the models do not completely agree with experimental data unless a model calibration is performed. The EMS modelling approach could be successfully extended to other dynamic glazing technologies that do not have a builtin model available in EnergyPlus, provided that an accurate thermo-optical characterisation of the dynamic glazing is available...|$|R
