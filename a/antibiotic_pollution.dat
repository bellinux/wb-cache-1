40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} {{has become}} a significant and growing threat to public and environmental health. To face this problem both at local and global scales, {{a better understanding of}} the sources and mechanisms that contribute to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance is required. Recent studies demonstrate that aquatic ecosystems are reservoirs of resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes as well as potential conduits for their transmission to human pathogens. Despite the wealth of information about <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution</b> and its effect on the aquatic microbial resistome, the contribution of environmental biofilms to the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance has not been fully explored in aquatic systems. Biofilms are structured multicellular communities embedded in a self-produced extracellular matrix that acts as a barrier to antibiotic diffusion. High population densities and proximity of cells in biofilms also increases the chances for genetic exchange among bacterial species converting biofilms in hot spots of antibiotic resistance. This review focuses on the potential effect of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution</b> on biofilm microbial communities, with special emphasis on ecological and evolutionary processes underlying acquired resistance to these compounds...|$|E

40|$|Antibiotics are disseminated into aquatic environments via {{human waste}} streams and {{agricultural}} run-off. Here they can persist at low, but biologically relevant, concentrations. <b>Antibiotic</b> <b>pollution</b> establishes a selection gradient for resistance {{and may also}} raise the frequency of events that generate resistance: point mutations; recombination; and lateral gene transfer. This study examined the response of bacteria to sub-inhibitory levels of antibiotics. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas protegens were exposed kanamycin, tetracycline or ciprofloxacin at 1 / 10 the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in a serial streaking experiment over 40 passages. Significant changes in rep-PCR fingerprints were noted in both species when exposed to sub-inhibitory antibiotic concentrations. These changes were observed in as few as five passages, {{despite the fact that}} the protocols used sample less than 0. 3 % of the genome, in turn suggesting much more widespread alterations to sequence and genome architecture. Experimental lines also displayed variant colony morphologies. The final MICs were significantly higher in some experimental lineages of P. protegens, suggesting that 1 / 10 the MIC induces de-novo mutation events that generate resistance phenotypes. The implications of these results are clear: exposure of the environmental microbiome to <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution</b> will induce similar changes, including generating newly resistant species that may be of significant concern for human health. 10 page(s...|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} the potential effect of soil veterinary <b>antibiotics</b> <b>pollution</b> {{on the growth}} of rice, a main food crop in China, oxytetracycline which was used widely in livestock and poultry breeding was selected to test the effects of different levels of soil <b>antibiotics</b> <b>pollution</b> on growth and yield of rice plant at both seedling and growth periods. Relationship between oxytetracycline accumulated in different organs of rice plant and oxytetracycline pollution levels in the soil was characterized. The {{results showed that the}} effects of soil oxytetracycline pollution on rice growth mainly occurred at the seedling stage, and the effect on the underground part was obviously greater than the above-ground part of rice. Significant negative effects on biomass of the underground part of rice, root activity, and chlorophyll content and oxidase activity of the leave at the seedling stage were found when soil oxytetracycline pollution concentrations was over 30 mg·kg- 1. The consequence from the impact of soil oxytetracycline pollution on rice seedling could be extended to the whole growth period of the plant, which could reduce the number of tiller and rice yield. Oxytetracycline accumulated in various organs of rice plant was in the sequence of root> leaf> stem> grain. Rice roots had low capacity to uptake oxytetracycline from the soil, the transfer capacity of oxytetracycline from the roots to leaf, stem, and grain was also weak. Considering the low oxytetracycline pollution levels in most of current actual farmland soils (less than 10 mg·kg- 1) and lower accumulation character of oxytetracycline in the grain, it is thought that the direct damage of soil oxytetracycline pollution on rice production is small...|$|R
40|$|Antibiotics, {{which are}} hardly removed from {{polluted}} water by conventional water-treatment technologies, adsorption has been deemed {{as one of}} the efficient and promising method to resolve the problems of <b>antibiotics</b> <b>pollution.</b> Herein, we reported a synthesis of filtration separable hollow nanostructured silicas (HNSs) with efficient click functionalization property for antibiotics adsorption. The clickable HNSs were synthesized by the co-condensation and assembling of tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) and 3 -azidopro-pyltrimethoxysilane (AzPTMS) around F 127 single micelle template. Alkynyl compounds such as phenylacetylene (Ph), propargyl alcohol (PA), 1 -heptyne (Hep), and 2 -butyne- 1, 4 -diol (BD) have been linked to the materials through click reaction with high efficiency. Antibiotic adsorption results reveal that functional groups {{play an important role in}} adsorption properties of adsorbents and phenyl was found to be the optimal functional group due to the pi-pi stacking effect. Excellent adsorption capacity and recyclability indicate that the clickable hollow nanostructured silicas exhibit potential application for antibiotics removal. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of studies pointed out the ubiquitous presence of medical residues in surface and ground water {{as well as in}} soil compartments. Not only antibiotics {{can be found in the}} environment but also their transformation products about which little information is generally available. The development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is particularly worrying as it can lead to sanitary and health problems. Studies about the dissemination of antibiotics and associated resistances in the Bolivian Altiplano are scarce. We provide baseline information on the occurrence of Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and Trimethoprim (TMP) antibiotics as well as on the most common human SMX transformation products (TP) and on the occurrence of sulfonamide resistance genes. The studied water and soil compartments presented high levels of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution.</b> This situation was shown to be mainly linked with uncontrolled discharges of treated and untreated wastewaters, resulting on the presence of antibiotics in the Titicaca Lake. SMX TPs were detected in surface waters and on soil sampled next to the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). SMX resistance genes sulI and sulII were widely detected in the basin hydrological network, even in areas unpolluted with antibiotics. Mechanisms of co-selection of antibiotic- and metal- resistance may be involved in the prevalence of ARG's in pristine areas with no anthropogenic activity and free of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution...</b>|$|E
40|$|To {{quantify}} {{the extent of}} antibiotic contamination and to identity the dominant pollutant sources in the Tiaoxi RiverWatershed, surface water samples were collected at eight locations and analyzed for four tetracyclines and three sulfonamides using ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The observed maximum concentrations of tetracycline (623 ng L- 1), oxytetracycline (19, 810 ng L- 1), and sulfamethoxazole (112 ng L- 1) exceeded their corresponding Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) values. In particular, high concentrations of antibiotics were observed in wet summer with heavy rainfall. The maximum concentrations of antibiotics appeared {{in the vicinity of}} intensive aquaculture areas. High-resolution land use data were used for identifying diffuse source of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution</b> in the watershed. Significant correlations between tetracycline and developed (r = 0. 93), tetracycline and barren (r = 0. 87), oxytetracycline and barren (r = 0. 82), and sulfadiazine and agricultural facilities (r = 0. 71) were observed. In addition, the density of aquaculture significantly correlated with doxycycline (r = 0. 74) and oxytetracycline (r = 0. 76), while the density of livestock significantly correlated with sulfadiazine (r = 0. 71). Principle Component Analysis (PCA) indicated that doxycycline, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole were from aquaculture and domestic sources, whereas sulfadiazine and sulfamethazine were from livestock wastewater. Flood or drainage from aquaculture ponds was identified as a major source of antibiotics in the Tiaoxi watershed. A hot-spot map was created based on results of land use analysis and multivariable statistics, which provided an effective management tool of sources identification in watersheds with multiple diffuse sources of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution...</b>|$|E
40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} {{represents a}} growing global health concern {{due to the}} overuse and misuse of antibiotics. There is, however, little information about how the selective pressure of clinical antibiotic usage can affect environmental communities in aquatic ecosystems and which bacterial groups might be responsible for dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) into the environment. In this study, chemical and biological characterization of water and sediments from three water supply reservoirs subjected to a wide pollution gradient allowed to draw an accurate picture of the concentration of antibiotics and prevalence of ARGs, in order to evaluate the potential role of ARGs in shaping bacterial communities, and to identify the bacterial groups most probably carrying and disseminating ARGs. Results showed significant correlation between the presence of ARG conferring resistance to macrolides and the composition of bacterial communities, suggesting that <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution</b> and the spreading of ARG might {{play a role in}} the conformation of bacterial communities in reservoirs. Results also pointed out the bacterial groups Actinobacteria and Firmicutes as the ones probably carrying and disseminating ARGs. The potential effect of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution</b> and the presence of ARGs on the composition of bacterial communities in lacustrine ecosystems prompt the fundamental question about potential effects on bacterial-related ecosystem services supplied by lakes and reservoirs. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|<b>Antibiotics</b> <b>pollution</b> {{has become}} a {{critical}} environmental issue worldwide due to its high ecological risk. In this study, rapid degradation of enrofloxacin (ENR) was observed on goethite {{in the presence of}} Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1 during the transition from anaerobic to aerobic conditions. The abiotic reactions also demonstrated that over 70 % with initial concentration of 10 mg L- 1 ENR was aerobically removed within 5 min by goethite with adsorbed Fe(II), without especial irradiation and strong oxidants. The results of spin trap electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments provide evidence that Fe(II) /Fe(III) complexes facilitate the generation of center dot OH. The electrophilic attack by center dot OH opens the quinolone ring of ENR and initiates further transformation reactions. Five transformation products were identified using high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and the ENR degradation process was proposed accordingly. The identification of ENR transformation products also revealed that both the surface adsorption and the electron density distribution in the molecule determined the reactive site and transformation pathway. This study highlights an important, but often underappreciated, natural process for in situ degradation of antibiotics. With the easy migration of the goethite-MR- 1 complex to the anaerobic/aerobic interface, the environmental fates of ENR and other antibiotics need to be seriously reconsidered...|$|R
40|$|The occurrence, {{distribution}} and bioaccumulation of 22 antibiotics, including eight fluoroquinolones (FQs), nine sulfonamides (SAs) and five macrolides (MLs), in the Haihe River were investigated. Surface water, sediment and fish samples {{were analyzed by}} HPLC-MS/MS. Ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine, erythromycin and roxithromycin were found in all surface water samples. SAs were the predominant antibiotics in surface water samples {{in the mainstream of}} Haihe River, with the maximum concentration of 201 ng L- 1 for sulfamethoxazole. Compared with Haihe River, higher concentrations of antibiotics were found in the surface water samples in the Dagu and Chentaizi Drainage Rivers.

In sediment samples, FQs were the most frequently detected antibiotics and their concentrations were much higher than SAs and MLs. The high concentrations and detection frequencies of FQs in sediments indicate that sediments are an important reservoir for FQs as they are strongly adsorbed onto sediments.

40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{application of}} veterinary antibiotics in livestock industry makes swine wastewater {{an important source}} of <b>antibiotics</b> <b>pollution.</b> This work investigated the degradation of six selected antibiotics, including five sulfonamides and one macrolide, by Fenton's reagent in swine wastewater pretreated with sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The dosing mode and practical dosage of Fenton's reagent were optimized to achieve an effective removal of antibiotics while save the treatment cost. The effects of initial pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and suspended solids (SS) of the SBR effluent on antibiotics degradation were examined. The results indicate that the optimal conditions for Fenton's reagent with respect to practical application were as follows: batch dosing mode, 15 : 1 molar ratio of [H(2) O(2) ]/[Fe(2 +) ], initial pH 5. 0. Under the optimal conditions, Fenton's reagent could effectively degrade all the selected antibiotics and was resistant to the variations in the background COD (0 - 419 mg/L) and SS (0 - 250 mg/L) of the SBR effluent. Besides, Fenton's reagent helped to not only remove total organic carbon (TOC), heavy metals (As, Cu and Pb) and total phosphorus (TP), but also inactivate bacteria and reduce wastewater toxicity. This work demonstrates that the integrated process combining SBR with Fenton's reagent could provide comprehensive treatment to swine wastewater. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The activities of modern world had been responsible for these changes in the atmosphere. In addition to chemical pollutants, biological materials such as pollen, bacteria, viruses and spores are also present and are responsible for deteriorating quality of air. Bacteria {{play an important role in}} the geochemical cycle. They could be used for monitoring pollution and for removing/reducing pollution load as well. Bacteria tend to acquire genetic components for these processes and environmental forces. select the fittest organisms. In this manner bacteria varies from one environment to another and tend to be unique to an area. The aim of this study was to screen the phenotypic and genotypic characters of airborne bacteria isolated from different sites of Karachi city. During this study four sites were selected for the isolation of airborne bacteria, these sites were Karachi University, Gaddani (Ship breaking area), Tanneries at Korangi sector 7 -A and Civil Hospital. 55 pure strains were isolated from these sites, they were identified, gram stained and their resistance to various antibiotics and metals were studied. Most of the strains were found to be resistant to antibiotics and heavy metals, which indicated <b>antibiotics</b> and metal <b>pollution</b> in those sites. On the basis of genotypic characteristics the strains were screened for reduction, accumulation and solubilization activity against heavy metals. Among the isolated strains CMG 821 (Pseudomonas 'sp.) showed accumulation of copper salt, whereas in CMG 480 (Cucurbit yellow vine disease bacterium) aerobic and anaerobic reduction of chromate was observed. Analysis of cell sections using transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) showed intracellular copper in CMG 821 (Pseudomonas sp.) but CMG 480 (Cucurbit yellow vine disease bacterium) precipitated chromate extracellularly. CMG 8 I 4. (Klebsiella sp.), CMG 818 (Pseudomonas sp.), CMG 823 (Pseudomonas sp.) and CMG 826 (Pseudomonas sp.) showed metal solubilization activity. Among these CMG 814 was found to have plasmid DNA of 9. 9 kb and 7. 5 kb The plasmids were successfully transferred to E. coli J- 53 and JM-I 09 nonsolubilizing strains by conjugation and transformation. The zone of solubilization were formed by the transformants and transconjugants as well. Tn mutants of CMG 823 (which did not show the presence of plasmid) were produced these mutants lacked the solubilizing activity; this suggested that perhaps the solubilizing genes (Sol+) were present on chromosomes in this strain. The results of tn mutants, transformants and transconjugants have suggested that the solubilizing genes are perhaps spread on both chromosomes and plasmid and their location varies in various strains.

Here, fluoroquinolone-polluted river sediment, well water, irrigated farmland, and human fecal flora of local villagers within a pharmaceutical industrial region in India were analyzed for quinolone resistance (qnr) genes by quantitative PCR. Similar samples from Indian villages farther away from industrial areas, as well as fecal samples from Swedish study participants and river sediment from Sweden, were included for comparison. Fluoroquinolones were detected by MS/MS in well water and soil from all villages located within three km from industrially polluted waterways. Quinolone resistance genes were detected in 42 % of well water, 7 % of soil samples and in 100 % and 18 % of Indian and Swedish river sediments, respectively. High antibiotic concentrations in Indian sediment coincided with high abundances of qnr, whereas lower fluoroquinolone levels in well water and soil did not. We could not find support for an enrichment of qnr in fecal samples from {{people living in the}} fluoroquinolone-contaminated villages. However, as qnr was detected in 91 % of all Indian fecal samples (24 % of the Swedish) it suggests that the spread of qnr between people is currently a dominating transmission route...|$|E
40|$|Estimating <b>{{antibiotic}}</b> <b>pollution</b> and {{antibiotic resistance}} development risks in environmental compartments {{is important to}} design management strategies that advance our stewardship of antibiotics. In this study we propose a modelling approach to estimate the risk of antibiotic resistance development in environmental compartments and demonstrate its application in aquaculture production systems. We modelled exposure concentrations for 12 antibiotics used in Vietnamese Pangasius catfish production using the ERA-AQUA model. Minimum selective concentration (MSC) distributions that characterize the selective pressure of antibiotics on bacterial communities were derived from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) Minimum Inhibitory Concentration dataset. The antibiotic resistance development risk (RDR) for each antibiotic was calculated as {{the probability that the}} antibiotic exposure distribution exceeds the MSC distribution representing the bacterial community. RDRs in pond sediments were nearly 100 % for all antibiotics. Median RDR values in pond water were high {{for the majority of the}} antibiotics, with rifampicin, levofloxacin and ampicillin having highest values. In the effluent mixing area, RDRs were low for most antibiotics, with the exception of amoxicillin, ampicillin and trimethoprim, which presented moderate risks, and rifampicin and levofloxacin, which presented high risks. The RDR provides an efficient means to benchmark multiple antibiotics and treatment regimes in the initial phase of a risk assessment with regards to their potential to develop resistance in different environmental compartments, and can be used to derive resistance threshold concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{recognition}} of the occurrence of antibiotics in the environment has highlighted concerns regarding potential threats of antibiotics to humans and wildlife. Antibiotics are commonly applied to animals to prevent diseases and promote growth, making livestock agriculture {{a major source of}} <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution.</b> The purpose of our study was to examine chlorination technology as a method for preventing the release of antibiotics as well as antibiotic-resistant bacteria into the environment from concentrated animal feeding operations. Wastewaters from various sites of two anaerobic lagoon systems, one aerated and the other not, on a swine facility were investigated. Each system consisted of a primary treatment lagoon and a subsequent polishing lagoon. Free chlorine (or monochloramine for comparison) was applied to oxidize antibiotics and to disinfect lagoon bacteria as well. Results indicate that aeration substantially improves lagoon functionality, thereby adding both organic and ammonia removal. Ammonia present in the wastewaters plays a critical role in antibiotics decomposition and bacterial inactivation due to its rapid competition for free chlorine to form monochloramine. Generally, a chlorine dose close to breakpoint is required to achieve complete removal of antibiotics, leading to high consumption of free chlorine in most of the wastewaters examined. However, because of a low ammonia concentration in the polishing lagoon wastewater of the aerated system, a chlorine dose of 100 mg/L can effectively achieve complete removal of both antibiotics and bacteria. On the basis of our experimental findings, a possible strategy for the treatment of swine wastewater is suggested...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} selective pressure of antibiotics on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and bacterial communities in manure-polluted aquatic environment. Three treatment groups were set up in freshwater-sediment microcosms: tetracyclines group, sulfonamides group and fluoroquinolones group. Sediment and water samples were collected on day 14 after treatment. Antibiotic concentrations, ARGs abundances and bacterial community composition were analyzed. Antibiotic concentrations were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. ARGs abundances were quantified by real time quantitative PCR. Bacterial community composition was analyzed based on amplicon sequencing. Of the three classes of antibiotics analyzed in the treatment groups, accumulation amounts were tetracyclines> fluoroquinolone> sulfonamides in the sediment samples, while they were sulfonamides> fluoroquinolone> tetracyclines in the water samples. In the treatment groups, the relative abundances of some tet resistance genes (tet(W) and tet(X)) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes (oqx(B) and aac(6 ’) -Ib) in sediment samples were significantly higher than those in the paired water samples. Tetracyclines significantly selected the bacterial classes including Gammaproteobacteria, Clostridia, and the genera including Salmonella, Escherichia/Shigella, Clostridium, Stenotrophomonas in sediment samples. The significant selection on bacterial communities posed by sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones was also observed. The results indicated that sediment may supply an ideal setting for maintenance and persistence of tet resistance genes (tet(W) and tet(X)) and PMQR genes (oqx(B) and aac(6 ’) -Ib) under <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution.</b> The results also highlighted that antibiotics significantly selected specific bacterial communities including the taxa associated with opportunistic pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Antibiotic {{resistant}} {{bacteria are}} found in most environments, especially in highly anthropized waters. A direct correlation between human activities (e. g. pollution) and spread and persistence of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and resistance genes (ARGs) within the resident bacterial communities appears more and more obvious. Furthermore, the threat posed for human health {{by the presence of}} ARB and ARGs in these environments is enhanced by the risk of horizontal gene transfer of resistance genes to human pathogens. Although the knowledge on the spread of antibiotic resistances in waters is increasing, the understanding of the driving factors determining the selection for antibiotic resistance in the environment is still scarce. <b>Antibiotic</b> <b>pollution</b> is generally coupled with contamination by heavy metals (HMs) and other chemicals, which can also promote the development of resistance mechanisms, often through co-selecting for multiple resistances. The co-selection of heavy metal resistance genes and ARGs in waters, sediments, and soils, increases the complexity of the ecological role of ARGs, and reduces the effectiveness of control actions. In this mini-review we present the state-of-the-art of the research on antibiotic- and HM-resistance and their connection in the environment, with a focus on HM pollution and aquatic environments. We review the spread and the persistence of HMs and/or ARB, and how it influences their respective gene co-selection. In the last chapter, we propose Lake Orta, a system characterized by an intensive HM pollution followed by a successful restoration of the chemistry of the water column, as a study-site to evaluate the spread and selection of HMs and antibiotic resistances in heavily disturbed environments...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{describes}} {{the development of}} a fast and robust analytical method for the determination of 53 antibiotic residues, covering various chemical groups and some of their metabolites, in environmental matrices that are considered important sources of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution,</b> namely hospital and urban wastewaters, as well as in river waters. The method is based on automated off-line solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–QqLIT). For unequivocal identification and confirmation, and in order to fulfill EU guidelines, two selected reaction monitoring (SRM) transitions per compound are monitored (the most intense one is used for quantification and the second one for confirmation). Quantification of target antibiotics is performed by the internal standard approach, using one isotopically labeled compound for each chemical group, in order to correct matrix effects. The main advantages of the method are automation and speed-up of sample preparation, by the reduction of extraction volumes for all matrices, the fast separation of a wide spectrum of antibiotics by using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography, its sensitivity (limits of detection in the low ng/L range) and selectivity (due to the use of tandem mass spectrometry) The inclusion of β-lactam antibiotics (penicillins and cephalosporins), which are compounds difficult to analyze in multi-residue methods due to their instability in water matrices, and some antibiotics metabolites are other important benefits of the method developed. As part of the validation procedure, the method developed was applied to the analysis of antibiotics residues in hospital, urban influent and effluent wastewaters as well as in river water sample...|$|E
40|$|While <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution</b> has {{attracted}} considerable attention {{due to its}} potential in promoting the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in the environment, the antibiotic activity of their related substances has been neglected, which may underestimate {{the environmental impacts of}} antibiotic wastewater discharge. In this study, a real-time quantitative approach was established to evaluate the residual antibacterial potency of antibiotics and related substances in antibiotic production wastewater (APW) by comparing the growth of a standard bacterial strain (Staphylococcus aureus) in tested water samples with a standard reference substance (e. g. oxytetracycline). Antibiotic equivalent quantity (EQ) was used to express antibacterial potency, which made it possible to assess the contribution of each compound to the antibiotic activity in APW. The real-time quantitative method showed better repeatability (Relative Standard Deviation, RSD 1. 08 %) compared with the conventional fixed growth time method (RSD 5. 62 - 11. 29 %). And its quantification limits ranged from 0. 20 to 24. 00 mg L- 1, depending on the antibiotic. We applied the developed method to analyze the residual potency of water samples from four APW treatment systems, and confirmed a significant contribution from antibiotic transformation products to potent antibacterial activity. Specifically, neospiramycin, a major transformation product of spiramycin, was found to contribute 13. 15 - 22. 89 % of residual potency in spiramycin production wastewater. In addition, some unknown related substances with antimicrobial activity were indicated in the effluent. This developed approach will be effective for the management of antibacterial potency discharge from antibiotic wastewater and other waste streams...|$|E
40|$|Background: Antibiotic {{resistance}} genes (ARGs) are widespread but {{cause problems}} only when present in pathogens. Environments where selection and transmission of antibiotic resistance frequently take place {{are likely to}} be characterized by high abundance and diversity of horizontally transferable ARGs. Large-scale quantitative data on ARGs is, however, lacking for most types of environments, including humans and animals, as is data on resistance genes to potential co-selective agents, such as biocides and metals. This paucity prevents efficient identification of risk environments. Results: We provide a comprehensive characterization of resistance genes, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and bacterial taxonomic compositions for 864 metagenomes from humans (n[*]=[*] 350), animals (n[*]=[*] 145) and external environments (n[*]=[*] 369), all deeply sequenced using Illumina technology. Environment types showed clear differences in both resistance profiles and bacterial community compositions. Human and animal microbial communities were characterized by limited taxonomic diversity and low abundance and diversity of biocide/metal resistance genes and MGEs but a relatively high abundance of ARGs. In contrast, external environments showed consistently high taxonomic diversity which in turn was linked to high diversity of both biocide/metal resistance genes and MGEs. Water, sediment and soil generally carried low relative abundance and few varieties of known ARGs, whereas wastewater/sludge was on par with the human gut. The environments with the largest relative abundance and/or diversity of ARGs, including genes encoding resistance to last resort antibiotics, were those subjected to industrial <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution</b> and a limited set of deeply sequenced air samples from a Beijing smog event. Conclusions: Our study identifies air and antibiotic-polluted environments as under-investigated transmission routes and reservoirs for antibiotic resistance. The high taxonomic and genetic diversity of external environments supports the hypothesis that these also form vast sources of unknown resistance genes, with potential to be transferred to pathogens in the future...|$|E
40|$|Antibiotic {{resistant}} {{bacteria and}} antibiotic resistance genes cause increasing problems in clinical setting and are worldwide considered emerging environmental contaminants, but {{little is known}} about their fate in the receiving environment and how natural microbial populations may be affected. In the environment, antibiotic resistant bacteria (e. g. pathogen) may die but their resistance determinants may become part of the environmental gene pool via horizontal gene transfer to environmental bacteria. From this localization, resistance genes may move back to human and animal bacteria via food and drinking water. Natural environment, especially water, is considered a “hot spot” for spread of antibiotics resistance in this scenario Aeromonas spp. were considered the model of hydric microorganisms exposed to the actions of residual antibiotic compounds and to the aquatic resistome, whereas Faecal Coliforms represented the allochthonous population contaminating the aquatic environment. In order to investigate how these two bacterial populations could be influenced by potential <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution,</b> we want to examine the presence, the distribution and the transferability of transposons, integrons, and plasmids in Aeromonas spp. and Faecal Coliforms isolated from different aquatic environments submitted to a diverse degree of antibiotic contamination. In this work, we want to highlight if there are common genetic determinants in the two populations and check the potential transferability of these genetic determinants. Conjugation, natural transformation and transduction are the three mechanisms of horizontal antibiotic resistance genes transfer among bacteria. Additionally, we want to investigate if Aeromonas could also be a good donor in mating experiments with other bacteria and if it is able to naturally acquired free DNA from the environment and if Aeromonas DNA could be incorporated by natural competent bacteria. Finally we want to study lytic and lysogenic bacteriophages of Aeromonas spp., investigate the presence of resistance genes on phage DNA and evaluate if phage can transfer these resistance genes by transduction experiments...|$|E

However, {{there are no}} evaluations of these systems {{as a source of}} <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution.</b> This study was conducted to evaluate the presence, diversity, and distribution of tetracycline resistance genes in the grasslands of the Colombian Andes, where administration of antibiotics to animals is limited to treat disease and growth promoters are not included in animals’ diet. Animal (ruminal fluid and feces) and environmental (soil and water) samples were collected from different dairy cattle farms and evaluated by PCR for the genes tet(M), tet(O), tetB(P), tet(Q), tet(W), tet(S), tet(T), otr(A), which encode ribosomal protection proteins (RPPs), and the genes tet(A), tet(B), tet(D), tet(H), tet(J), and tet(Z), encoding efflux pumps. A wide distribution and high frequency for genes tet(W) and tet(Q) were found in both sample types. Genes tet(O) and tetB(P), detected in high frequencies in feces, were detected in low frequencies or not detected at all in the environment. Other genes encoding RPPs, such as tet(M), tet(S), and tet(T), were detected at very low frequencies and restricted distributions. Genes encoding efflux pumps were not common in this region, and only two of them, tet(B) and tet(Z), were detected. DGGE–PCR followed by comparative sequence analysis of tet(W) and tet(Q) showed that the sequences detected in animals did not differ from those coming from soil and water. Finally, the farms sampled in this study showed more than 50 % similarity in relation to the tet genes detected. In conclusion, there was a remarkable presence of tet genes in these {{production systems}} and, although not all genes detected in animal reservoirs were detected in the environment, there is a predominant distribution of tet(W) and tet(Q) in both animal and environmental reservoirs. Sequence similarity analysis suggests the transmission of these genes from animals to the environment...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the persistence of antibiotics in soil, especially in areas of vegetable cultivation. However, {{there are very few}} studies of the influence of planting regimes on the levels of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>pollution.</b> This work introduces geographical-detector models to investigate the relationship between planting patterns (vegetable planting model, manure type and quantity, planting age, greenhouse area, and topographic elevation) and residual fluoroquinolones (FQs) in soil in a pilot project in Shouguang County, Shandong Province (the largest vegetable-producing area in China). The results led to the following findings. 1. The vegetable planting model is the major determinant of the spatial stratification of FQ in the soil. For example, the "cucumber-cucumber" model (growing cucumbers after cucumbers) has a three-fold power of determinant compared to the "pepper-melon" model (growing melons after peppers). 2. Planting age (years with continuous vegetable cultivation) does not necessarily affect the spatial distribution of FQ owing to their relatively short degradation period. 3. Interactions between risk factors were more significant than the individual factors for FQ pollution. In particular, the interaction between the vegetable planting model and amount of manure resulted in the highest pollution level. The findings of the present study make it possible to introduce effective and practical measures to alleviate pollution of soils by FQ in the study area. Adjustment of the vegetable cultivation models and application of chicken manure (less than 6 kg/m 2 manure annually with a more dry than fresh manure) could be an effective and flexible approach to alleviate FQ pollution. The vegetable planting model is the major determinant of FQ difference in soil. Planting age could not result in spatial pollution differences. Interactions between risk factors should be given more concern. 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|Background: Many {{bacteria}} {{of clinical}} importance survive and may grow in different environments. <b>Antibiotic</b> <b>pollution</b> may exert on them a selective pressure {{leading to an}} increase in the prevalence of resistance. Objectives: In this study we sought to determine whether environmental concentrations of antibiotics and concentrations representing action limits used in environmental risk assessment may exert a selective pressure on clinically relevant bacteria in the environment. Methods: We used bacterial inhibition as an assessment end point to link antibiotic selective pressures to the prevalence of resistance in bacterial populations. Species sensitivity distributions were derived for three antibiotics by fitting log-logistic models to end points calculated from minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distributions based on worldwide data collated by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). To place bacteria represented in these distributions in a broader context, we performed a brief phylogenetic analysis. The potentially affected fraction of bacterial genera at measured environmental concentrations of antibiotics and environmental risk assessment action limits was used as a proxy for antibiotic selective pressure. Measured environmental concentrations and environmental risk assessment action limits were also directly compared to wild-type cut-off values. Results: The potentially affected fraction of bacterial genera estimated based on antibiotic concentrations measured in water environments is ≤ 7 %. We estimated that measured environmental concentrations in river sediments, swine feces lagoons, liquid manure, and farmed soil inhibit wild-type populations in up to 60 %, 92 %, 100 %, and 30 % of bacterial genera, respectively. At concentrations used as action limits in environmental risk assessment, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin were estimated to inhibit wild-type populations in up to 25 % and 76 % of bacterial genera. Conclusions: Measured environmental concentrations of antibiotics, as well as concentrations representing environmental risk assessment action limits, are high enough to exert a selective pressure on clinically relevant bacteria that may lead {{to an increase in}} the prevalence of resistance...|$|E
