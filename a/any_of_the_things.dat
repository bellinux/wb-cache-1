500|$|The show {{revolved}} around themes of evolution, {{as well as}} her paranoias represented on The Fame Monster. While developing the tour Gaga spoke about original sin and demons inside human beings; [...] "So we talked about growth, and that led us into this kind of scientific space, and we started talking about evolution and the evolution of humanity and how we begin as one thing, and we become another." [...] This theme of monsters and evolution played a part in the fashion for the tour, which according to Gaga was [...] "another level from where we were with the Fame Ball. [...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to." [...] Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour, she concluded that {{she did not want to}} use <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that they had designed together. Later, she said that Fame Kills was [...] "the great lost tour", but confirmed that some of the elements of it were incorporated into The Monster Ball.|$|E
500|$|Nigel Kneale, {{scriptwriter}} {{of both of}} the Cartier dramas acclaimed by the BFI, {{felt that}} the productions {{would not have been}} as successful as they were had they been handled by any other director. [...] "I don't think <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I wrote then would have come to anything much in other hands. In his they worked." [...] Television historian Jason Jacobs, a lecturer in film and television studies at the University of Warwick, wrote in 2000 that Kneale and Cartier together created an entirely new, more expansive vision for British television drama in the 1950s."It was the arrival of Nigel Kneale... and Rudolph Cartier... that challenged the intimate drama directly. Cartier is rightly recognised as a major influence on the visual development of British television drama... Cartier and Kneale had the ambition for their productions to affect a mass audience, and the scope of their attention was not confined to the 'cosy' aesthetics of intimacy. Cartier uses the close-up both to reveal emotions and as a shock device: a more threatening—and perhaps exhilarating—method than was used before. 'Intimacy' is reformulated by Cartier in terms of his power and control over the viewer—no longer a part of the family, but isolated in his home." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The New York Times in late November, Trump responded to the controversy over Bannon's appointment, saying [...] "I’ve known Steve Bannon a long time.

2500|$|Livingstone {{issued a}} 2005 dossier praising Qaradawi as a moderate, based on {{positive}} press coverage {{he had received}} previously. Livingstone pronounced that Tatchell has [...] "a long history of Islamophobia", and asserted {{that he is in}} a [...] "de facto alliance with the American neo-cons and Israeli intelligence services." [...] Tatchell strenuously denied the accusations, pointing out that he has never said <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that Livingstone accused him of saying. Livingstone continued to describe Qaradawi as “one of the leading progressive voices in the Muslim world” in 2010, after having been denied entry to the UK for his extremist views.|$|E
2500|$|Astronomer Dr Philip Plait {{has pointed}} out that Velikovsky's {{hypothesis}} is also falsified by the presence of the Moon with its nearly circular orbit for which the length of the month has not changed sensibly in the 5,800 years the Jews have used their lunar calendar. [...] "If Venus were to get so close to the Earth that it could actually exchange atmospheric contents ," [...] as Velikovsky claimed, [...] "[...] [...] the Moon would have literally been flung into interplanetary space. At the very least its orbit would have been profoundly changed, made tremendously elliptical... Had Venus done <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> Velikovsky claimed, the Moon's orbit would have changed." ...|$|E

[...] She was soon interviewed by Lin Sampson for Playboy and reinforced her disagreement with the defence witnesses. In the favourable article, Sampson described the rage against Allan as [...] "the first public showing of {{what would become the}} new South African psychosis". Sunday Times defence witnesses were said to be irate that their shared publisher, Times Media, published the article. The newspaper proceeded to publish an extract of the interview to promote its sister magazine sales.|$|E
2500|$|Eurogamer's Ellie Gibson {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 7 out of 10, writing [...] "this is a sequel which doesn't really move things on much [...] there's {{not a lot}} that's new here." [...] She did praise the environments, which she called [...] "diverse, {{detailed}} and brilliantly lit," [...] and the enemies, to which she referred as [...] "well designed, with fluid animations and varied attack patterns." [...] She concluded [...] "There's not a lot new here [...] But {{the good news is}} that they've managed not to mess up <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> which made the original so enjoyable [...] This isn't a game that's going to raise any bars, push any envelopes or revolutionise any genres. But if you played and enjoyed the first game and fancy more of the same, The Suffering: Ties That Bind won't disappoint." ...|$|E
2500|$|Suárez {{returned}} from his ban on 6 February against Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League, coming on as a substitute in a 0–0 draw at Anfield; Dalglish reacted to his return by saying [...] "It's fantastic to have him back. He {{should never have been}} out in the first place". Ahead of the 11 February game between United and Liverpool at Old Trafford, the Premier League stated that the formal pre-match handshake would go ahead, Ferguson stated that he thought Evra should shake Suárez's hand, while Dalglish stated that Suárez would too. However, during the traditional pre-game handshakes, Suárez appeared to avoid Evra's hand, leading to Evra grabbing Suárez's arm. Suárez ignored Evra and continued down the line causing Evra to throw his arms up in protest and Rio Ferdinand to also avoid shaking Suárez's hand. Despite Liverpool ordering Suárez not to talk about the racial abuse incident, Suárez continued to discuss it. In May 2012, Suárez called his suspension [...] "strange and unbelievable" [...] and said that there was [...] "not a single convincing proof that [...] had done <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> they accused [...] of doing"; he also denied that he had refused to shake Evra's hand. In 2014, Suárez released his autobiography Crossing the Line, in which he continued to deny the verdict that he had racially abused Evra, stating [...] "what some people will never want to accept is that the argument took place in Spanish. I did not use the word [...] "negro" [...] the way it can be used in English", despite admitting that the word [...] "negro" [...] means [...] "black". He also complained about the after-effects, saying the verdict that he was a racist would be [...] "a stain on my character that will probably be there forever".|$|E
