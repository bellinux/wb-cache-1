5|$|This {{film was}} shot mainly at Shepperton Studios in Surrey, England, {{and on his}} arrival at Southampton aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2, Cagney was mobbed by {{hundreds}} of fans.

5|$|Arizona was {{commissioned}} into the Navy on 17 October 1916 with John D. McDonald as captain. She departed New York on 10 November 1916 after {{the crew had}} cleaned the ship and the propulsion system had been tested <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> After declinating the ship's magnetic compasses, the ship sailed south for her shakedown cruise. Outside Guantanamo Bay, a stripped turbine on 7 December forced the navy to order Arizona back to New York for repairs, although {{she was able to}} enter Chesapeake Bay to test her main and secondary gun batteries on 19–20 December. The turbine could not be repaired inside the ship, so the yard workers had to cut holes in the upper decks to lift the damaged casing out. It was reinstalled after almost four months of repairs at the naval yard.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s {{virtually}} all commercial shipping activity had ceased <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> although its warehouses did remain in {{use for the}} storage of goods transported by barge, road or rail. The onset of the Second World War in 1939 saw the Albert Dock being 'requisitioned' by the Admiralty and used as base for the British Atlantic fleet including submarines, small warships and landing craft. During the war the dock was struck on several occasions including a bombing raid in 1940 that damaged ships within it, and more destructively during the May Blitz of 1941 when German bombing caused extensive damage to the south west stack. By {{the end of the}} war almost 15% of the Albert Dock's floor space was out of use because of bomb damage.|$|E

50|$|Palmer {{was born}} in Carmarthenshire, Wales in 1860. Palmer {{undertook}} several projects <b>at</b> <b>the</b> West India <b>Docks.</b> <b>The</b> first was the construction of several sheds <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Import <b>Dock</b> between 1912 and 1917. Between 1926 and 1930 he built five more sheds <b>at</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Dock</b> and between 1929 and 1930 he constructed four more <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Export <b>Dock.</b>|$|R
5|$|The next morning, Brody's {{teenage son}} Mike disobeys his father by sneaking out to go sailing {{with his friends}} after his love interest, Jackie Peters, goads him to, but his younger brother, Sean, catches him, and persuades Mike to bring him along. After an {{argument}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> Marge, one of Mike's friends, playfully lets Sean come in her boat with her, and {{after a couple of}} other grouping arrangements, they head out, going past a team of divers, led by instructor Tom Andrews. Moments after going underwater, Andrews encounters the shark. Panicking, he rushes to the surface, causing an embolism. Soon after, the shark hits teenagers Tina Wilcox and Eddie Marchand; Eddie falls into the water and is killed by the shark.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} {{primarily}} in Cornwall and the Upper Boat Studios in Wales. The {{exterior of the}} pirate ship was filmed at a dock in Cornwall, while the lower decks were built from a set at the studio. The principal challenge to film <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> was to ensure the audience would not see it. The crew set up smoke machines to simulate fog. To create the storm the crew used wind and rain machines, the latter of which went through 15,000 litres of water. The loud noise from the wind machines caused communication difficulties during takes. Anticipating they would get soaked, the cast present on the deck wore dry suits underneath their clothes. Before filming began on the storm sequences, Darvill heard that he would perform the stunt where he is thrown into the sea, and was willing to perform it. The stunt would later be performed by a double.|$|E
5|$|Kalākaua's Masonic ties as Master of Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie {{would give}} him a global brotherhood in his travels. He and his chosen companions boarded the {{steamship}} City of Sydney at 6:30a.m., January 20, bound for San Francisco. As the King made his way onto the ship, many in the crowd <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> reached out to touch him. Major George W. Macfarlane, his aide-de-camp, would accompany them as far as California. The King traveled as Aliʻi Kalākaua and as Prince Kalākaua, rather than in his capacity as head of state. The intent was to give the impression of a personal vacation, thereby avoiding the large costly retinue required for official business. The Royal Hawaiian Band, the Hawaiian army, and a large contingent of well-wishers bid them farewell as the City of Sydney sailed out.|$|E

5|$|The media stridently criticised Miller's omission, as did {{former players}} such as Stan McCabe and Alan Kippax. During the off season, {{he worked as a}} {{journalist}} and played baseball, but declined a trial with a Major League Baseball club, the Boston Red Sox. Miller captained New South Wales {{at the start of the}} 1949–50 season as his colleagues went to South Africa, his first leadership experience in the Sheffield Shield. He scored 80 and took six wickets in the first match against Queensland. After another victory over Western Australia, he received a request from the Australian Board of Control. At the request of captain Hassett, Miller was asked to tour South Africa as cover for Johnston, who had been injured in a car crash. Miller accepted the offer and resigned himself to bowling heavily. Miller almost missed the trip after arriving late <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> in Perth after a drunken night. The next boat to South Africa would not have departed for several weeks. Despite his recall, there remained tension over his initial omission, as Dwyer was the team manager.|$|E

25|$|A ferry {{operates}} {{between the}} same location and the airport every 15 minutes from 5:15am to midnight (the 5:15 ferry is for airport staff; airline passengers can begin crossing at 5:30). A free shuttle bus service operates between downtown (from the intersection of York Street and Front Street) and the airport. There is a taxi stand <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> Short-term and long-term parking is available <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> and on the island. There is no curb-side parking. PortsToronto recommends taking those with special needs by car, taking the ferry and parking on the island at the airport terminal. The 509 Harbourfront streetcar line, which connects to the subway, serves the intersection of Bathurst Street and Queens Quay, one block north of the ferry dock.|$|E
