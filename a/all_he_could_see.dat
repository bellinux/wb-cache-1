500|$|Napoleon {{went forward}} {{to see the}} {{situation}} from the former Russian front lines shortly after the redoubts had been taken. The Russians {{had moved to the}} next ridge-line in much disarray; however, that disarray was not seen from that distance with the dust and haze raised by an army on the move. [...] Kutuzov ordered the Russian Guard to hold the line and so it did. [...] All of the artillery that the French army had was not enough to move it. [...] Those compact squares made good artillery targets and the Russian Guard stood in place from 4pm to 6pm unmoving under its fire resulting in huge casualties. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> were masses of troops in the distance and thus nothing more was attempted. Neither the attack, which relied on brute force, nor the refusal to use the Guard to finish the day's work showed any brilliance on Napoleon's part.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few minutes}} before 3:00p.m. at about [...] in {{altitude}} and near Mineral, Washington, he gave up his search and started heading eastward towards Yakima. He saw a bright flashing light, similar to sunlight reflecting from a mirror. Afraid he might be dangerously close to another aircraft, Arnold scanned the skies around him, but <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was a DC-4 to his left and behind him, about [...] away.|$|E
2500|$|Legend {{says that}} {{one day after the}} war was over, Ashoka ventured out to roam the city and <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> were burnt houses and {{scattered}} corpses. The lethal war with Kalinga transformed the vengeful Emperor Ashoka to a stable and peaceful emperor and he became a patron of Buddhism. According to the prominent Indologist, A. L. Basham, Ashoka's personal religion became Buddhism, if not before, then certainly after the Kalinga war. However, according to Basham, the Dharma officially propagated by Ashoka was not Buddhism at all. Nevertheless, his patronage led to the expansion of Buddhism in the Mauryan empire and other kingdoms during his rule, and worldwide from about 250 BCE. Prominent in this cause were his son Mahinda (Mahendra) and daughter Sanghamitra (whose name means [...] "friend of the Sangha"), who established Buddhism in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).|$|E

60|$|Stuyvesant looked. <b>All</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> however, was {{a gaping}} wound in Phonny's boot, {{just over the}} ankle, and {{something}} bloody beneath.|$|R
5000|$|Some children's play songs include {{elements}} such as [...] "There's a hole {{at the bottom of}} the sea", or [...] "A sailor went to sea... but <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was the bottom of the deep blue sea".|$|R
60|$|The skipper's {{daughter}} was standing beside him, looking down commiseratingly. Of {{the rest of}} the family <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was the broad blue seats of their trousers as they leaned hopefully over the side in the quest for wealth.|$|E
60|$|Bobby Coon {{had become}} wide awake as he listened. He {{tried hard to}} get a peep at the {{stranger}} with Unc' Billy, but <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was a long tail of feathers. Bobby waited until Unc' Billy and his friend had left. Then he crawled out of the hollow log, and he was chuckling to himself.|$|E
60|$|It was a cold, raw day, with a {{touch of}} snow in the air, and Ben felt one of his desperate moods coming over him. His hands and feet were free and he peered forth from the one narrow window that the cell contained. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> beyond was a courtyard, {{surrounded}} by a stone wall.|$|E
60|$|Over {{the heads}} of <b>all</b> these <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> into the chancel to the square pew on the north side, which was {{attached}} to Welland House. There he discerned Lady Constantine already arrived, her brother Louis sitting by her side.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ladies, {{your way}} stands clear," [...] he said, {{with that same}} {{pleasant}} irony still apparent in his voice, and without casting more than a cursory glance at the close hoods and dark masks, which was <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> of the ladies, whom he had so incontinently saved from an unpleasant position.|$|R
60|$|<b>All</b> this <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> with {{microscopic}} clearness, for {{the distance}} {{was no more}} than twenty feet. And <b>all</b> this <b>he</b> saw in such brief time, that he saw it as he lifted his carbine to his shoulder. He glanced along the sights, and knew that he was gazing upon a man who was as good as dead. It was impossible to miss at such point blank range.|$|R
60|$|So Unc' Billy Possum {{gave it up}} {{and went}} {{on down to the}} Smiling Pool. There Little Joe Otter and Billy Mink and Jerry Muskrat were at play. They saw Unc' Billy coming, and when he reached the bank of the Smiling Pool there sat the three little scamps on the Big Rock, but <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was their backs.|$|E
60|$|Pretty {{soon they}} came to a nice mossy green log right across the Lone Little Path. Peter Rabbit stopped and sat up very {{straight}}. He looked this way and looked that way. Johnny Chuck stopped too and he sat up very straight and looked this way and looked that way, but <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was the mossy green log across the Lone Little Path.|$|E
60|$|Graillot {{resumed his}} seat. He watched {{with an almost}} painful curiosity the changes in Louise's face, which was convulsed by a storm of passionate apprehension. Yet behind it <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the truth. There was {{something}} softer in her face {{than he had ever}} perceived before, a tenderer light than he had ever seen in her eyes. He sighed {{and looked down at the}} carpet.|$|E
60|$|He did so. Rollo said {{it looked}} <b>all</b> dark; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> any thing. Then Jonas opened {{it a little}} farther, and Rollo saw two little shining eyes, and {{presently}} a nose smelling along at the crack.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1930s, Bessie became {{alarmed at}} {{the rise of}} fascism, and began working for the anti-fascist cause.No {{stranger}} to soldiering, through 1938 Bessie fought as a volunteer in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade of the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War. Upon his return, {{he wrote a book}} about his experiences, Men in Battle. About the book, Ernest Hemingway commented:A true, honest, fine book. Bessie writes truly and finely of <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> ... and <b>he</b> saw enough.|$|R
50|$|In 1871 Neruda was {{declared}} to be a Traitor of the Nation. At {{this time he}} spent some time abroad, for example in Italy, Greece, France, Germany, Hungary or Egypt. He tried to record <b>all</b> the observations <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> It contains some interesting pieces which can declare him as a good observer.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Quick,' {{said the}} wizard, {{in a low}} voice, and he rushed towards the empty holes, which even in the night shone brightly from the treasures within them. Flinging himself on his knees, the old man began filling the wallets he had brought, {{listening}} intently all {{the time for the}} return of the stones up the hill, while Bernez more slowly put handfuls of <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> into his pockets.|$|E
60|$|At {{his first}} words Frona turned white, and she {{remained}} white throughout the reading. Once she stole {{a glance at}} her father, and was glad {{that he was looking}} straight before him, for she did not feel able to meet his gaze just them. On the other hand, though she knew St. Vincent was eying her narrowly, she took no notice of him, and <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was a white face devoid of expression.|$|E
60|$|Sam {{gave way}} at last, as arter <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{it was the}} safest thing to do, but he 'ad so {{much to say about}} it that they got fair sick of the sound of 'is voice. They 'ad to go 'ome for 'im to put the belt on; and then at seven o'clock in the evening, arter Sam had 'ad two or three pints, they had to go 'ome agin, 'cos he was {{complaining}} of tight-lacing.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Claxon {{said that}} she would talk it over with the child's father; and then Mrs. Lander pressed her to let her take Clementina back to the Middlemount with her for supper, if they wouldn't let her stay the night. After Clementina had driven away, Mrs. Claxon accused herself to her husband of being the {{greatest}} fool in the State, but he said that the carriage was one of the Middlemount rigs, and he guessed it was <b>all</b> right. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that Clem was wild to go, and he didn't see why she shouldn't.|$|R
40|$|Enclosed with No. 223. Called on Pfundtner {{to discuss}} cases of Philip Zuckerman and Walter Orloff; Pfundtner thought Zuckerman attack regrettable and {{offenders}} should be prosecuted; suggested Ambassador [William E. Dodd] should see Foreign Minister [Konstantin] von Neurath; in meantime, Pfundtner {{said he was}} competent {{to a certain degree}} in the matter and would do <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to <b>see</b> that the attackers are brought to justice; he didn't think proceedings against Orloff could be dropped; told Pfundtner evidence against Orloff seemed very flimsy; believes he will also do what he can in that matter...|$|R
6000|$|Sewell {{expected}} the audible crash of Barker's air-castles {{to break the}} silence which the young man suffered to follow upon these words; but {{nothing of the kind}} happened, and for <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> Barker remained wholly unaffected by what he had said. It nettled Sewell a little to see him apparently so besotted in his own conceit, and he added: [...] "But I think I had better not ask you to rely altogether upon my opinion in the matter, and I will go with you to a publisher, and you can get a professional judgment. Excuse me a moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{some one}} under that old board," [...] thought Peter, and peeped under. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{was that there}} was {{something}} moving. Instantly Peter was all curiosity. Whoever was there was not very big. He was sure of that. Of course that meant that he had nothing to fear. So what do you think Peter did? Why, he just pulled that old board over. And when he did that, he saw, whom do you think? Why, Old Mr. Toad, to be sure.|$|E
60|$|Holding fast, lest a rash motion {{should set}} him {{bounding}} further down, {{like a living}} ball, Corny took an observation as rapidly as possible, for the red light was fading, and the mist rising from the valley. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was a narrow ledge where the tree stood, and anxious to reach a safer bed for the night, he climbed cautiously down to drop on the rock, so full of gratitude for safety that he could only lie quite still for a little while, thinking of mother, {{and trying not to}} cry.|$|E
60|$|Peter Rabbit {{left the}} Lone Little Path across the Green Meadows for some secret little paths of his own. His long legs took {{him over the}} ground very fast. Johnny Chuck, running behind him, grew tired and hot, for Johnny's legs are short and he is fat and roly-poly. At times <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was the white patch on the seat of Peter Rabbit's pants. He began to wish that he had minded old Mrs. Chuck and stayed at home. It {{was too late to}} go back now, for he didn't know the way.|$|E
60|$|In the {{seclusion}} of his bedroom, he {{sat down}} to smoke a last cigarette and think the thing over in <b>all</b> its aspects. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> no way out of his difficulties. The thought had something of the dull persistency of a toothache. It refused to leave him. If only this had happened at Oxford, he knew of twenty kindly men who would have rallied round him, and placed portions of their fathers' money at his disposal. But this was July. He would not see Oxford again for months. And, in the meantime, Wesson would be pressing for his money.|$|R
60|$|They {{were both}} too deeply {{interested}} in the subject of their conversation to look toward the conservatory, and to notice the appearance at that moment of a distant gentleman among the plants and flowers, who had made his way in from the garden outside. Advancing noiselessly on the soft Indian matting, the gentleman ere long revealed himself under the form and features of Horace Holmcroft. Before entering the dining-room he paused, fixing his eyes inquisitively {{on the back of}} Lady Janet's visitor--the back being <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> in the position he then occupied. After a pause of an instant the visitor spoke, and further uncertainty was at once at an end. Horace, nevertheless, made no movement to enter the room. He had his own jealous distrust of what Julian might be tempted to say at a private interview with his aunt; and he waited a little longer on the chance that his doubts might be verified.|$|R
60|$|So {{they lived}} upon {{the island for}} three days, and rested and ate to their hearts' content. Still, they were not at all happy in this life because of Pessim. He {{continually}} found fault with them, and all that they did, and <b>all</b> their surroundings. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing good or admirable {{in all the world}} and Trot soon came to understand why the little man's former neighbors had brought him to this island and left him there, <b>all</b> alone, so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not annoy anyone. It was their misfortune that they had been led to this place by their adventures, for often they would have preferred the company of a wild beast to that of Pessim.|$|R
60|$|Derek {{had not the}} {{privilege}} {{of being able to}} read Jill's thoughts. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was the outer Jill, and the outer Jill, as she had always done, was stirring his emotions. Her daintiness afflicted him. Not for the first, the second, or the third time since they had come into each other's lives, he was astounded at the strength of the appeal which Jill had for him when they were together, as contrasted with its weakness when they were apart. He made another attempt to establish the scene on a loftier plane.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to know it was all me. But I can't pretend. Of course I'll try and not let it hurt you more than I {{possibly}} can. I'm sorry for you, poor Daddy; oh! I'm sorry for you!" [...] With a movement incredibly lithe and swift, she turned and pressed her face down in the pillow, so that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was her tumbled hair and the bedclothes trembling above her shoulders. He tried to stroke that hair, but she shook her head free, and he stole out.|$|E
60|$|Neale ran to {{the back}} room, where, above the din outside, he made himself heard. But for <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> or hear his tidings of rescue did not at once affect the men there. Then he forgot them and the fight outside in his search for Allie. The cabin was on fire, {{and he did not}} mean to leave it until he was {{absolutely}} sure she was not hidden or lying in a faint in some corner. And he had not made sure of that until the burning roof began to fall in. Then he leaped out the window and ran back to the inclosure.|$|E
60|$|<b>All</b> {{the time}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> quite clearly the insect going round the cornice and darting across the room, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> also <b>see</b> that the nurse saw {{nothing of it}} {{and looked at him}} strangely. He must keep himself in hand. He knew he was a lost man if he did not keep himself in hand. But as the night waned the fever grew upon him, and the very dread he had of seeing the moth made him see it. About five, just as the dawn was grey, he tried {{to get out of bed}} and catch it, though his leg was afire with pain. The nurse had to {{struggle}} with him.|$|R
60|$|She {{called to}} Lionel, {{told him of}} her ill success, and begged him not to move, while she again pursued the runaway, and a long dance he led her, far {{out of sight of}} Lionel. Once she had {{considerable}} hopes, when she came in sight of a shepherd boy, who stood in amaze at the lady in chase of the runaway steed, then came up with a run to cut off its course, but so awkwardly that the pony was still more frightened, and galloped off in another direction faster than ever! Poor Marian! However after full half an hour, she succeeded in hunting him into a narrow place between two fields, ending in a gate, caught safely hold of the rein, kept it fast, and at length led Sorrel back in triumph to the spot where poor Lionel stood still patiently. She called out to him as soon as she came near enough to make her voice heard, and he answered, and walked forward to meet the dark shapes, which were <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b>|$|R
60|$|The look of {{the night}} had rather a {{lowering}} effect on young Holliday's good spirits. He began to contemplate the houseless situation {{in which he was}} placed, from the serious rather than the humorous point of view; and he looked about him, for another public-house to inquire at, with something very like downright anxiety in his mind on the subject of a lodging for the night. The suburban part of the town towards which he had now strayed was hardly lighted at <b>all,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing of the houses as he passed them, except that they got progressively smaller and dirtier, the farther he went. Down the winding road before him shone the dull gleam of an oil lamp, the one faint, lonely light that struggled ineffectually with the foggy darkness <b>all</b> round him. <b>He</b> resolved to go on as far as this lamp, and then, if it showed him nothing in the shape of an Inn, to return to {{the central part of the}} town and to try if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not at least secure a chair to sit down on, through the night, at one of the principal Hotels.|$|R
