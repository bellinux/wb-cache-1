We have shown that in fibroblast-keratinocyte co-cultures, indomethacin, employed at concentrations which inhibit the PGE 2 synthesis, reduced the proliferation of epidermal cells. This effect was reversed by an exogenous PGE 2 addition to the culture media. To better understand the relationship between keratinocytes and the <b>autacoid,</b> we have tested PGE 2 at various concentrations in different cultural conditions, that is, epidermal cells were grown on a 3 T 3 -J 2 feeder layer, without fibroblasts and with a 3 T 3 -J 2 conditioned medium. We observed an increase in keratinocyte proliferation induced by the <b>autacoid</b> alone in the presence of fibroblasts, while a severe inhibitory effect was relieved when dermal cells or the conditioning medium were absent. The lack of fibroblasts and their products in the culture medium modified the morphology of keratinocytes cultured in vitro.

Daily treatments with exogenous PGF 2 alpha at concentrations equal to or lower than 10 (- 6) M induced significant increases in cell proliferation when the epithelial cells were cultured on a keratocyte feeder-layer or with the conditioning medium. No variations were observed in cultures grown with the basal medium. 10 (- 5) M PGF 2 alpha induced a decrease in cell growth under all culturing conditions.

Palmitoylethanolamide, found in peripheral tissues, has been proposed to behave as a local <b>autacoid</b> capable of downregulating mast cell activation and inflammation. A cognate N-acylamide, anandamide, the ethanolamide of arachidonic acid, occurs in brain and is a candidate endogenous agonist for the central cannabinoid receptor (CB 1). As a second cannabinoid receptor (CB 2) has been found in peripheral tissues, the possible presence of CB 2 receptors on mast cells and their interaction with N-acylamides was investigated. Here we report that mast cells express both the gene and a functional CB 2 receptor protein with negative regulatory effects on mast cell activation. Although both palmitoylethanolamide and anandamide bind to the CB 2 receptor, only the former downmodulates mast cell activation in vitro. Further, the functional effect of palmitoylethanolamide, {{as well as that of}} the active cannabinoids, was efficiently antagonized by anandamide. The results suggest that (i) peripheral cannabinoid CB 2 receptors control, upon agonist binding, mast cell activation and therefore inflammation; (ii) palmitoylethanolamide, unlike anandamide, behaves as an endogenous agonist for the CB 2 receptor on mast cells; (iii) modulatory activities on mast cells exerted by the naturally occurring molecule strengthen a proposed <b>autacoid</b> local inflammation antagonism (ALIA) mechanism; and (iv) palmitoylethanolamide and its derivatives may provide antiinflammatory therapeutic strategies specifically targeted to mast cells ("ALIAmides") ...|$|R

Intimal thickening and coronary vasospastic responses to serotonin and histamine were induced {{at the site of the}} coronary artery where IL- 1 beta was chronically and locally applied. These responses were significantly suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by cotreatment with ST 638. In addition, ST 494, which is an inactive form of ST 638, did not inhibit those responses.

Our data indicate that PGE 2 {{plays an important role in}} the growth of corneal epithelial cells. Actually, epithelial cells cultured on a keratocyte feeder-layer and exposed to indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, have shown a decrease in growth rate at drug concentrations which otherwise did not induce a reduction in the viability of the keratocytes as well as in epithelial cells in separate cultures. This effect has been reversed by an exogenous PGE 2 addition to the culture media. Moreover, significant increases have been found in the growth of epithelial cells cultured in the presence of keratocytes, with basal medium and with conditioning medium after adding exogenous PGE 2 at concentrations equal to or lower than 10 (- 6) M. Significant decreases in the dimensions of the corneal epithelial cells have been found only when PGE 2 has been added to basal and to conditioning medium, suggesting that the <b>autacoid</b> maintains cell dimension and morphology. The appearance of keratins with high molecular weight (54 and 57 kDa) coupled with the tendency to stratification of the cells cultivated with media supplemented with PGE 2, indicates that the <b>autacoid</b> could favour cell differentiation.

40|$|Glomerular <b>autacoids</b> {{stimulated by}} {{bradykinin}} regulate efferent arteriole tone. BackgroundWe {{have shown that}} when efferent arterioles are perfused retrograde to avoid the influence of vasoactive <b>autacoids</b> released by the glomerulus, bradykinin causes dilatation via release of cytochrome P 450 (cP 450) metabolites, probably epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). Here we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} glomerulus releases cyclooxygenase (COX) and cP 450 metabolites. These eicosanoids, acting as vasopressor and vasodepressor <b>autacoids,</b> control efferent arteriole resistance downstream from the glomerulus. MethodsRabbit efferent arterioles were perfused orthograde through the glomerulus {{from the end of the}} afferent arteriole to determine whether bradykinin induces the release of glomerular <b>autacoids</b> that influence efferent arteriole resistance. Efferent arterioles were preconstricted with norepinephrine, and increasing doses of bradykinin were added to the perfusate in the presence or absence of COX and cP 450 inhibitors. ResultsWhen efferent arterioles were perfused orthograde through the glomerulus, bradykinin at 10 nmol/L caused significant and reproducible dilatation; diameter increased from 8. 0 ± 0. 5 to 12. 6 ± 0. 4 μm (P < 0. 05). This effect was not modified by a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor. In the presence of indomethacin, a COX inhibitor, bradykinin-induced dilatation was almost completely blocked (from 8. 0 ± 0. 5 to 9. 3 ± 0. 6 μm). This blockade was completely reversed by 20 -hydroxyeicosa- 6 (Z), 15 (Z) -dienoic acid (20 -HEDE), a specific antagonist of the vasoconstrictor cP 450 metabolite 20 -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20 -HETE); diameter increased from 6. 6 ± 0. 7 to 13. 2 ± 0. 5 μm. To test the hypothesis that this dilatation was due to EETs, a specific inhibitor of EET synthesis, N-methylsulphonyl- 6 -(2 -proparglyloxyphenyl) hexanamide (MS-PPOH), was added to the arteriolar perfusate. In the presence of indomethacin and 20 -HEDE, bradykinin caused dilatation and this effect was completely blocked by MS-PPOH (1 μm) (from 7. 6 ± 0. 6 to 7. 3 ± 0. 5 μm). ConclusionsWe concluded that in response to bradykinin, the glomerulus releases COX metabolites (probably prostaglandins) that have a vasodilator effect. When COXs are inhibited, the vasoconstrictor 20 -HETE released by the glomerulus is able to oppose the vasodilator effect of bradykinin. This vasodilator effect is mediated by EETs released by the glomerulus and/or the efferent arteriole and does not involve nitric oxide. The balance between these opposing effects of various eicosanoids controls efferent arteriole resistance downstream from the glomerulus...|$|E
