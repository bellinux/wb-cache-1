5000|$|He {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "one of the great unheralded figures in photography". In the 1850s he discovered that gelatin in combination with either potassium or <b>ammonium</b> <b>bichromate</b> hardens in proportion to the amount of light that falls on it. This discovery, significant for its capacity to facilitate the mass production of photographs, was later used by numerous figures such as Josef Albert, Joseph Wilson Swan, Paul Pretsch and Charles Nègre to develop subsequent photographic printing processes such as heliogravure, photogravure, collotype, autotype and carbon print.|$|E
40|$|Non-abrasive antifrictional surface {{finishing}} {{is one of}} the most perspective technique of surface treatments. The technique is very simple, easily and economically applied. The papers outlines the description of this method, there are discussed some effects and a scheme of a device designed for realizing this technique is given. There is also given the operation principles of surface activating materials glycerin and <b>ammonium</b> <b>bichromate</b> in forming coatings, chemical reactions and their products. The tribotechnical experiments were carried out with pair “steel – aluminium alloy ” in the case of adaptation period and extreme loads conditions. The obtained experimental results are shown by images of load variation, friction moment dependences graphs, treated by NASF and working surfaces. To form a brass coating on steel 45 surface, there may be used both organic (glycerin) and inorganic (<b>ammonium</b> <b>bichromate)</b> substances. The obtained surfaces by NASF technique may hold out much greater loads, their wear is almost 5 times less than of those ones which were not treated. Rollers with PAM <b>ammonium</b> <b>bichromate</b> more easily were adapting themselves to load change...|$|E
