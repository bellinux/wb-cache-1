A transient model of an HTSMA actuator was used to evaluate <b>active</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>control</b> at various operating points in a test bed aircraft engine simulation.

A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller with integrator windup protection was implemented to control clearance amidst engine transients during a normal mission. Simulation results show that the control system exhibits minimal variability in clearance control performance across the operating envelope.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the requirements of}} a control system for <b>active</b> turbine tip <b>clearance</b> <b>control</b> in a generic commercial turbofan engine through design and analysis. The control objective is to articulate the shroud in the high pressure turbine section {{in order to maintain}} a certain clearance set point given several possible engine transient events. The system must also exhibit reasonable robustness to modeling uncertainties and reasonable noise rejection properties. Two actuators were chosen to fulfill such a requirement, both of which possess different levels of technological readiness: electrohydraulic servovalves and piezoelectric stacks.

40|$|Magnetic {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used as active suspension devices in rotating machinery, mainly for active vibration control purposes. The concept of <b>active</b> tip <b>clearance</b> <b>control</b> suggests a new application of magnetic bearings as servo-actuators to stabilize rotating stall in axial compressors. This paper presents a first-of-a-kind feasibility study of an active stall control experiment with a magnetic bearing servo-actuator in the NASA Glenn high-speed single-stage compressor test facility. Together with CFD and experimental data a two-dimensional, incompressible compressor stability model was used in a stochastic estimation and control analysis to determine the required magnetic bearing performance for compressor stall control. The resulting requirements introduced new challenges to the magnetic bearing actuator design. A magnetic bearing servo-actuator was designed which fulfilled the performance specifications. Control laws were then developed to stabilize the compressor shaft. In a second control loop, a constant gain controller was implemented to stabilize rotating stall. A detailed closed loop simulation at 100 % corrected design speed resulted in a 2. 3 % reduction of stalling mass flow which is comparable to results obtained in the same compressor by Weigl et al. (1998) using unsteady air injection. The design and simulation results presented here establish the viability of magnetic bearings for stall control in aero-engine high-speed compressors.

40|$|Abstract: A {{measuring}} {{system based on}} low-coherence interferometry has been developed to obtain temporally resolved blade-by-blade tip-clearance data from {{the early stages of}} gas turbines. Given real–time tip clearance data, future turbines might be able to actively <b>control</b> the tip <b>clearance</b> by adjusting the amount of cooling air to the blades or shroud. Monitoring the tip clearance can also provide valuable information about the condition of the stage for maintenance. The measurement technique depends on the interference between back-reflected light from the blade tips during the blade passage time and a frequency–shifted reference. Due to the measurement principle the absolute spatial accuracy only relies on the coherence length of the light source. Normally this is a superluminescent diode with coherence lengths of tens of microns. For typical scenarios where the tip-clearances are within a range of a few millimeters, the technique can yield data once every second for each blade. This allows to monitor transient effects during turbine start–up and shut–down. A single optical fiber of arbitrary length connects the self–contained optical and electronics setup to the turbine, thus separating it from heat, noise, and vibrations. The total cost of the optical probe is cheap enough so that the device can be made an integral part of a gas turbine for monitoring and it even allows for future <b>active</b> tip <b>clearance</b> <b>control.</b> The presented prototype of such a system is an all–fiber assembly, with self–calibrating capabilities and...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new <b>active</b> tip <b>clearance</b> <b>control</b> and structural health monitoring schemes in turbine engines {{and other types of}} rotating machinery requires sensors that are highly accurate and can operate in a high temperature environment. The use of a microwave sensor to acquire blade tip clearance and tip timing measurements is being explored at the NASA Glenn Research Center. The microwave blade tip clearance sensor works on principles that are very similar to a short range radar system. The sensor sends a continuous microwave signal towards a target and measures the reflected signal. The phase difference of the reflected signal is directly proportional to the distance between the sensor and the target being measured. This type of sensor is beneficial in that it has the ability to operate at extremely high temperatures and is unaffected by contaminants that may be present in turbine engines. The use of microwave sensors for this application is a new concept. Techniques on calibrating the sensors along with installation effects are not well quantified as they are for other sensor technologies. Developing calibration techniques and evaluating installation effects are essential in using these sensors to make tip clearance and tip timing measurements. As a means of better understanding these issues, the microwave sensors were used on a bench top calibration rig, a large axial vane fan, and a turbofan. Background on the microwave tip clearance sensor, an overview of their calibration, and the results from their use on the axial vane fan and the turbofan will be presented in this paper. I...|$|R
