In other regions, the bride price is paid in lengths of shell money, pigs, cassowaries or cash. Elsewhere, it is brides who traditionally pay a dowry.|$|E

25|$|In most legal systems, a {{bank deposit}} {{is not a}} bailment. In other words, the funds {{deposited}} <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>the</b> property of the customer.

That deposit account is a liability on the balance sheet of the bank. Each bank is legally authorized to issue credit up to a specified multiple of its reserves, so reserves available to satisfy payment of deposit liabilities are less than the total amount which the bank is obligated to pay in satisfaction of demand deposits.|$|E

In fact, both the inefficiency and absence {{of the role of}} the Central Bank of Egypt in qualitative and quantitative control as well as implementing banking procedures and standards was almost entirely responsible for the non-performing loans crisis. Banks steadily reduced credit from its peak of about EGP 30 billion in FY1999 and alternatively invested in more liquid no-risk securities such as treasury bills and government bonds. Improving private sector access to credit will critically depend on resolving the problem of non-performing loans with businesses and top government officials.|$|E

[...] Walker's {{activism}} was heightened by {{an incident in}} June 1897 in which residents of Urbana, Ohio, formed a lynch mob, removed a black man named [...] "Click" [...] Mitchell from the town jail, and publicly killed him by hanging. [...] Believing that Ohio's Republican Governor Asa Bushnell had failed to conduct an appropriate investigation into the lynching, Walker and other African Americans in Ohio left the Republican Party and formed the Negro Protective Party. [...] As {{a member of the}} party's Executive Committee, Walker helped organize the party's convention at Columbus, Ohio in September 1897.

[...] The party also began publishing [...] "The Negro Protector" [...] as its official organ. [...] When former slave and Republican Party official, Nelson T. Gant, attacked Walker and the Negro Protective Party, Walker responded with an open letter that was published in Ohio newspapers. [...] In the letter, Walker wrote:Notwithstanding N. T. Gant there are many [...] "intelligent Negroes" [...] who will support the Negro protective ticket and will hurl back at him with contempt his insults to their manhood that they are not free to leave the republican party without being branded as [...] "betrayers of their party" [...] and [...] "ungrateful to their Creator and their race." [...] Such fumings are manifestly the strongest evidence of an enslaved mind... Republicans... believe, or make pretense of believing, that the Negro owes eternal allegiance to the G. O. P. no matter what the issue... We shall not trespass further upon your valuable space, except to say that the Negro Protective party will live and its supporters hope never to regret the stand taken for free and independent manhood as a protest against every disregard, from whatever source, of the rights and privileges of the Negro as an American citizen.|$|E
