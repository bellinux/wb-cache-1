Instead, DuBois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought <b>about</b> <b>by</b> the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this group as the Talented Tenth and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.|$|E
