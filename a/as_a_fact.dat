5|$|Darwin {{published}} {{his theory of}} evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species. By the 1870s, the scientific community {{and much of the}} general public had accepted evolution <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact.</b> However, many favoured competing explanations and {{it was not until the}} emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.|$|E
25|$|Custom may be {{considered}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> and as a law. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact,</b> it is simply the frequent and free repetition of acts concerning the same thing; as a law, it is the result and consequence of that fact. Hence its name, which is derived from consuesco or consuefacio and denotes {{the frequency of the}} action.|$|E

25|$|Kelly's {{interest}} in skepticism derives {{in part from}} her concern about how fake mediums and psychics exploit gullible or vulnerable people. She has criticized television shows which present mediums and psychics <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact,</b> which in her opinion could undermine the understanding of science among teenagers. Kelly also considers that {{a belief in the}} supernatural prevents people from appreciating science and the real wonders of the world, and causes unnecessary fear in young people.|$|E
25|$|To the ancients, the {{parallel}} postulate seemed less obvious than the others. They {{were concerned with}} creating a system which was absolutely rigorous and to them {{it seemed as if}} {{the parallel}} line postulate should have been able to be proven rather than simply accepted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact.</b> It is now known that such a proof is impossible. Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the Elements: the first 28 propositions he presents are those that can be proved without it.|$|E

25|$|Entering somebody's {{personal}} space is normally {{an indication of}} familiarity and sometimes intimacy. However, in modern society, especially in crowded urban communities, {{it can be difficult}} to maintain {{personal space}}, for example when in a crowded train, elevator or street. Many people find such physical proximity to be psychologically disturbing and uncomfortable, though it is accepted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> of modern life. In an impersonal, crowded situation, eye contact tends to be avoided. Even in a crowded place, preserving personal space is important, and intimate and sexual contact, such as frotteurism and groping, is unacceptable physical contact.|$|E
25|$|British leaders—and {{those on}} the Continent—generally {{believed}} that division of the U.S. was inevitable. Remembering their own unsuccessful attempt to keep their former American colonies in the Empire by force of arms, the British considered Union efforts to resist a fait accompli to be unreasonable, but they also viewed Union resistance <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> {{that they had to}} deal with. Believing the war's outcome to be predetermined, the British saw any action they could take to encourage {{the end of the war}} as a humanitarian gesture. Lyons was instructed by Russell to use his own office and any other parties who might promote a settlement of the war.|$|E
25|$|According to the Estonian {{point of}} view, the {{occupation}} of Estonia by the Soviet Union lasted five decades, only interrupted by the Nazi invasion of 1941-1944. Following {{the events of the}} Bronze night in 2007, the national conservative UEN group of the European Parliament made a motion for a resolution acknowledging the 48 years of occupation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact.</b> The final version of the resolution of European parliament, however, only acknowledged Estonia's loss of independence lasting from 1940 to 1991 and that annexation of Estonia by Soviet Union was considered illegal by Western democracies. A motion by the left-wing GUE/NGL Group for a resolution condemning the relocation by the Estonian Government of the World War II memorial fell.|$|E

Finding {{it hard to get}} his foot in the door of on-air reporting, Cooper decided to enlist the help of a friend in making a fake press pass. At the time, Cooper was working <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> checker for the small news agency Channel One, which produces a youth-oriented news program that is broadcast to many junior high and high schools in the United States. Cooper then entered Myanmar on his own with his forged press pass and met with students fighting the Burmese government. He was ultimately able to sell his home-made news segments to Channel One.|$|E
25|$|Pressed on by {{his family}} and the {{prospects}} of financial security, Fondane contemplated becoming a lawyer. Having passed his baccalaureate examination in Bucharest, he was, according to his own account, a registered student at the University of Iași Law School, obtaining a graduation certificate but prevented from becoming a licentiate by the opposition of faculty member A. C. Cuza, the antisemitic political figure. According to a recollection of poet Adrian Maniu, Fondane again worked <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> checker for some months after his arrival to the capital. His activity as a journalist also allowed him to interview Arnold Davidovich Margolin, statesman of the defunct Ukrainian People's Republic, with whom he discussed the fate of Ukrainian Jews {{before and after the}} Soviet Russian takeover.|$|E
25|$|Nineteen {{years after}} Voldemort's downfall, Ron and Hermione have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, {{whom they are}} sending off to her first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo. Though the {{epilogue}} does not explicitly say Ron and Hermione are married, news articles and other sources treat it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact.</b> Ron has also passed his Muggle driving test, despite Hermione's apparent belief {{that he could not}} do so without Confunding the examiner. (Ron secretly reveals to Harry he actually did Confund the examiner.) He and Harry work for the Ministry of Magic as Aurors, and along with Hermione they have helped to revamp the Ministry; it is far different from the one that existed previously. Before becoming an Auror, Ron joins George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, which becomes a very lucrative business.|$|E

25|$|The Dhakeshwari {{temple was}} built in the 12th century by Ballal Sen, a king of the Sena dynasty, and many say the city was named after this temple. The current {{architectural}} style of the temple cannot be dated to that period because of the numerous repairs, renovations and rebuilding which have taken place over time. It is considered an essential part of Dhaka's cultural heritage. Many researchers say that the temple {{is also one of the}} Shakti Peethas, where the jewel from the crown of the Goddess Sati had fallen. Although there is not enough historical context to establish this <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact,</b> researchers were directed to this site while trying to locate the particular Shakti Peetha. Since ages, the temple has been held in great importance. The original 800-year-old statue was taken to Kumartuli, Kolkata, West Bengal, India. There remains the replica of original idol in Dhaka. The temple was further damaged during the Muslim mob attacks of 1989–90.|$|E
500|$|On the reverse, Lafayette holds a sword, {{extended}} upwards. Bartlett {{described the}} version of the statue that Barber worked from: [...] "Lafayette is represented in the statue <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> and a symbol, offering his sword and services to the American colonists {{in the cause of}} liberty. He appears as the emblem of the aristocratic and enthusiastic sympathy shown by France to our forefathers." [...] Swiatek and Breen noted, [...] "We may take Lafayette's pose on the statue, as depicted on the coin, to represent him in triumphal procession rather than charging against the enemy—note his sheathed sword, like a Highland pipe major's baton, serving as a standard rather than brandished unsheathed as a weapon." ...|$|E
500|$|By far {{the most}} {{significant}} factor {{that led to the}} princes' decision to accede to India was the policy of the Congress and, in particular, of Patel and Menon. The Congress' stated position was that the princely states were not sovereign entities, and as such could not opt to be independent notwithstanding the end of paramountcy. The princely states must therefore accede to either India or Pakistan. In July 1946, Nehru pointedly observed that no princely state could prevail militarily against the army of independent India. In January 1947, he said that independent India would not accept the divine right of kings, and in May 1947, he declared that any princely state which refused to join the Constituent Assembly would be treated as an enemy state. Other Congress leaders, such as C. Rajagopalachari, argued that as paramountcy [...] "came into being <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> and not by agreement", it would necessarily pass to the government of independent India, as the successor of the British.|$|E

500|$|Scenes showing Kristy McNichol innocently burying {{her hands}} in the dog's fur and his normal loving {{behavior}} when alone with her provides a stark image of [...] "how hatred can be familiar, reassuringly close." [...] J. Hoberman argues that the film [...] "naturalizes racism in an unnatural way" [...] in the contrasting depictions of white characters horrified by the dog's behavior, and black characters who grimly accept it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> of life. The film's ending has been argued to emphasize Fuller's own view that racism is something that is learned, but that once learned is a [...] "poison" [...] that can never truly [...] "be banished from those it infects." [...] But on the other hand, the dog is actually cured of attacking blacks, but not cured of his own hatred since the last thing he does is to attack a white man, and without being provoked into doing so at that. The ending implies therefore that it is hatred (and not racism) that cannot be banished from those it infects.|$|E
500|$|At {{some point}} between 1915 and 1917, Tzara is {{believed}} to have played chess in a coffeehouse that was also frequented by Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin. While Richter himself recorded the incidental proximity of Lenin's lodging to the Dadaist milieu, no record exists of an actual conversation between the two figures. Andrei Codrescu believes that Lenin and Tzara did play against each other, noting that an image of their encounter would be [...] "the proper icon of the beginning of [...] times." [...] This meeting is mentioned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> in Harlequin at the Chessboard, a poem by Tzara's acquaintance Kurt Schwitters. German playwright and novelist Peter Weiss, who has introduced Tzara as a character in his 1969 play about Leon Trotsky (Trotzki im Exil), recreated the scene in his 1975-1981 cycle The Aesthetics of Resistance. The imagined episode also inspired much of Tom Stoppard's 1974 play Travesties, which also depicts conversations between Tzara, Lenin, and the Irish modernist author James Joyce (who is also known to have resided in Zürich after 1915). His role was notably played by David Westhead in the 1993 British production, and by Tom Hewitt in the 2005 American version.|$|E
500|$|The appellants {{argued that}} the {{discretion}} conferred on the President and the Minister for Home Affairs by sections 8 and 10 of the ISA could only be exercised if the fact – which was jurisdictional in nature – that the appellants were likely to act or to continue acting in a manner prejudicial to Singapore's security could be objectively established. However, the Court concluded that the discretion conferred by the ISA on the President and the Minister for Home Affairs by those provisions, properly construed, did not involve a jurisdictional fact. Section 8(1) had expressly entrusted to the President the {{decision as to whether}} or not a detainee was likely to act or to continue acting in a manner prejudicial to national security, and section 10 had entrusted to the Minister the decision whether on available evidence a revocation order was necessary in the public interest. In any case, it could not have been Parliament's intent to leave the issue of whether a detainee was likely to act or continue acting in a manner prejudicial to Singapore's security to be objectively determined <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> by a court of law.
