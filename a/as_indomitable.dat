All her {{feelings}} as a woman, {{and as a}} woman who, {{for the first time}} in her life was beginning to submit to that sentiment which has so much influence on the happiness or misery of her sex, revolted at the cruel fate that she fancied Deerslayer was drawing down upon himself, while the sense of right, which God has implanted in every human breast, told her to admire an integrity <b>as</b> <b>indomitable</b> and as unpretending as that which the other so unconsciously displayed. Argument, she felt, would be useless, nor was she at that moment disposed to lessen the dignity and high principle that were so striking in the intentions of the hunter, by any attempt to turn him from his purpose.

60|$|The Reverend Meek Wolfe was, in spirit, a rare {{combination}} of the humblest self-abasement and of fierce spiritual denunciation. Like so many others of his sacred calling in the Colony he inhabited, {{he was not only}} the descendant of a line of priests, but it was his greatest earthly hope that he should also become the progenitor of a race in whom the ministry was to be perpetuated as severely as if the regulated formula of the Mosaic dispensation were still in existence. He had been educated in the infant college of Harvard, an institution that the emigrants from England had the wisdom and enterprise to found, within the first five-and-twenty years of their colonial residence. Here this scion of so pious and orthodox a stock had abundantly qualified himself for the intellectual warfare of his future life, by regarding one set of opinions so steadily, as to leave little reason to apprehend he would ever abandon the most trifling of the outworks of his faith. No citadel ever presented a more hopeless curtain to the besieger, than did the mind of this zealot to the efforts of conviction; for {{on the side of his}} opponents, he contrived that every avenue should be closed by a wall blank <b>as</b> <b>indomitable</b> obstinacy could oppose. He appeared to think that all the minor conditions of argument and reason had been disposed of by his ancestors, and that it only remain ed for him to strengthen the many defences of his subject, and, now and then, to scatter by a fierce sortie the doctrinal skirmishers who might occasionally approach his parish. There was a remarkable singleness of mind in this religionist, which, while it in some measure rendered even his bigotry respectable, greatly aided in clearing the knotty subject, with which he dealt, of much embarrassing matter. In his eyes, the strait and narrow path would hold but few besides his own flock. He admitted some fortuitous exceptions, in one or two of the nearest parishes, with whose clergymen he was in the habit of exchanging pulpits; and perhaps, here and there, in a saint of the other hemisphere, or of the more distant towns of the Colonies, the brightness of whose faith was something aided, in his eyes, by distance, as this opake globe of ours is thought to appear a ball of light to those who inhabit its satellite. In short, there was an admixture of seeming charity with an exclusiveness of hope, an unweariness of exertion with a coolness of exterior, a disregard of self with the most complaisant security, and an uncomplaining submission to temporal evils with the loftiest spiritual pretensions, that in some measure rendered him a man as difficult to comprehend as to describe.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{representations}} of Margaret Thatcher as war-leader in British drama. From Steven Berkoff’s satirical portrayal of “Maggot Scratcher” in his play Sink the Belgrano to Ian Curteis’ sympathetic dramatic interpretation of Thatcher in his tele-play The Falklands Play, British writers {{have continued to}} offer varying and controversial accounts of Thatcher’s role during the Falklands-Malvinas conflict. I will argue that throughout the Falklands campaign Thatcher deliberately constructed herself as victorious war-leader and Britain <b>as</b> an <b>indomitable</b> military force. Drawing on specific dramatic examples, military historians and academic commentary, I will show how dramatists have re-imagined or affirmed Thatcher’s own image of herself as war-leader {{in the years following}} the conflict, and how this self-conscious construction still impacts on writers who continue to re-visit the Falklands era for dramatic material. An analysis of Thatcher’s representation as war-leader provides a timely example of her military headship, and offers the opportunity to re-assess her own self-imposed iconography...|$|R
