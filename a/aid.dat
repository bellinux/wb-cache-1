As Union troops moved into the South, Coffin's group coordinated <b>aid</b> to slaves who had escaped to Union territory and began collecting food and other goods to distribute to former slaves who were now behind the Union lines. Coffin also petitioned the U.S. government to create the Freedmen's Bureau to assist the freed slaves. After the war he became involved in helping freed slaves establish businesses and obtain an education.

40|$|Use of inter-loop <b>aiding</b> for {{improving}} tracking performance {{has been widely}} researched in recent years. However, most of the previously proposed <b>aiding</b> schemes rely {{on the assumption that}} the <b>aiding</b> loop remains unaffected by received interference. This paper argues that this may not always be the case. It is likely that the performance of the <b>aiding</b> loop may also degrade in the case where interference is received at the <b>aiding</b> carrier’s frequency resulting in performance degradation of both <b>aiding</b> and <b>aided</b> loops. This paper proposes an <b>aiding</b> scheme that offers performance improvements in case interference corrupts both frequencies. Also, an algorithm is proposed that continuously updates the <b>aided</b> loop bandwidth to keep its jitter at a minimum. A relationship between the quality of the <b>aiding</b> signal and its effects on the performance of the <b>aided</b> loop is analysed. An adaptive Kalman filter-based implementation of the <b>aiding</b> architecture is proposed to improve the quality of <b>aiding</b> estimates. This implementation offers an improved margin against received interference. Simulation and real data results are presented that show improvements of 7 and 5 dB-Hz in this margin by employing the proposed <b>aiding</b> scheme with and without an adaptive Kalman filter...|$|R

The Soviet Union also provided 90 percent of Vietnam’s demand for raw materials and 70 percent of its grain imports.
