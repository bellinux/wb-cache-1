5|$|As it is {{separated}} from the mainland by 3miles (4.8km) of water, few large mammals inhabit the island, except those that traverse the ice during the winter months. Rabbits, fox, raccoons, otters, mink, gray and red squirrels, and chipmunks are all common as is the occasional beaver and coyote. Bats are the most abundant migratory mammals as crossing the water is no obstacle for them. There are many limestone caves serving as homes for the bats and many insects on the island for the bat to prey on. The island is frequented by migratory birds on their trips between their summer and winter habitats. Eagles and hawks are abundant in April and May, while smaller birds such as yellow warblers, <b>American</b> <b>redstart,</b> and indigo bunting are more common in early summer. Near the shoreline, gulls, herons, geese, and loons are common. Owls, including snowy owls and great grey owls, come to the island from the Arctic to hunt in the warmer climate. Other birds, such as chickadees, cardinals, blue jays, and woodpeckers, live on the island year-round. Toads have also been found.|$|E

A post-hoc analysis revealed that the order in which treatment songs were presented affected the birds' responses. For four of five response variables, subjects successfully distinguished between the songs of neighbors and strangers when played the fourth song in the trial. Thus, it would appear that in redstarts this type of discrimination may be observed only after an initial song-exposure period...|$|R

50|$|<b>American</b> <b>redstarts</b> {{display a}} mixed mating strategy; they are {{predominantly}} monogamous but around 25% of males maintain multiple territories and are polygynous. Even within monogamous pairs, {{a high proportion}} of offspring—as many as 40%—are not fathered by the male of the pair. The intensity of the male's coloration (which is due to carotenoid pigments) predicts their success at holding territory in their non-breeding, winter locations in the Caribbean, the probability that they will be polygynous, and the proportion of offspring in their nests that they will themselves father. Males are invariably very territorial and the superior males occupy the best habitats, such as moist mangroves, while inferior males occupy secondary habitats such as dry scrub forests.|$|R

40|$|For migratory songbirds nesting in {{northern}} temperate forests, a short breeding season demands that males rapidly establish territories.

To test conspecific attraction, we conducted playback experiments with <b>American</b> <b>redstarts</b> Setophaga ruticilla. Experimental results demonstrate that song playbacks strongly attract conspecifics, recruiting an average of 4. 2 additional males per plot; adult males new to our sites increased, while yearling males failed to respond.

40|$|International audienceTelomere length (TL) {{has been}} shown to be a {{potential}} predictor of survival in wild vertebrates, and, as a consequence, there is growing interest in understanding the causes of inter-individual variability in TL. In that context, developmental conditions deserve a specific attention because they are thought to be a major driver of telomere shortening. Because poor developmental conditions can accelerate telomere shortening and impair growth (resulting in a small adult size), a positive correlation between TL and body size is expected. However, and surprisingly, the relationship between body size and telomere length has rarely been described in wild vertebrates. Here, we specifically examined this question in hatch-year (HY) and after hatch-year (AHY) male wintering <b>American</b> <b>Redstarts</b> (Setophaga ruticilla). Although tarsus size was not related to TL, we found a significant positive correlation between bill size and TL in HY male Redstarts, therefore supporting the idea that determinants of some components of individual size are also important determinants of TL in young birds. Moreover, this positive relationship between bill size and TL was also found for AHY birds, suggesting that adult TL may be, at least partly, explained by the telomere dynamics that occurred during the developmental phase...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of three reproductive tactics {{in a population}} of <b>American</b> <b>redstarts</b> was estimated: extra-pair fertilization, egg-dumping, and male polyterritoriality. Using DNA fingerprinting we show that none of 108 nestlings samples {{were the result of}} egg dumping. In contrast, 40 % of nestlings were the result of extra-pair fertilizations. Males sired a greater proportion of their broods as they aged. In addition, promiscuous females were never fertilized by males that were younger than their social mates. Whether the poor reproductive performance of younger males was caused by female preference for older males or by intra-sexual competition was not determined. In any case, females would have benefited by mating with older males, if the traits that allowed the survival of the father were inherited by the females' offspring. Only three of 80 males attracted two females through polyterritoriality. One male fledged two broods: he sired both nestlings from his first brood, but none of the four nestlings from his second brood. We concluded that male redstarts can improve their reproductive success by trying to obtain extra-pair copulations, but less so by establishing a second territory...|$|R

The difference in mean arrival dates between the sexes was greatest in species that arrived earliest. Similarly, within species, the difference between sexes was greatest in years when the males arrived earliest. For individuals within a species {{there was a significant}} negative correlation between arrival date and wing length; however, males of a particular size generally arrived earlier than females of the same size. Thus, larger size may be an advantage to early arrival, but is not sufficient to explain the difference in arrival between sexes.

40|$|Natal dispersal, {{the process}} through which {{immature}} individuals permanently depart their natal area in search of new sites, is integral to the ecology and evolution of animals. Insights about {{the underlying causes of}} natal dispersal arise mainly from research on species whose short dispersal distances or restricted distributions make them relatively easy to track. However, for small migratory animals, the causes of natal dispersal remain poorly understood because individuals are nearly impossible to track by using conventional mark–recapture approaches. Using stable-hydrogen isotope ratios in feathers of <b>American</b> <b>redstarts</b> (Setophaga ruticilla) captured as immature birds and again as adults, we show that habitat use during the first tropical nonbreeding season appears to interact with latitudinal gradients in spring phenology on the temperate breeding grounds to influence the distance traveled on the initial spring migration and the direction of natal dispersal. In contrast, adult redstarts showed considerable site fidelity between breeding seasons, indicating that environmental conditions did not affect dispersal patterns after the first breeding attempt. Our findings suggest that habitat occupancy during the first nonbreeding season helps determine the latitude at which this species of Neotropical–Nearctic migratory bird breeds throughout its life and emphasize the need to understand how events throughout the annual cycle interact to shape fundamental biological processes...|$|R

Moreover, these species had a very high degree of overlap in both foraging location and type of attack. Simulated territorial intrusions also indicated that these species are competing. However, Adelaide's did not shift their foraging niche after Redstarts left and these species were not interspecifically territorial.

However, measuring baseline corticosterone levels in the field is difficult because the capture protocol may affect rates of corticosterone secretion. In passerine birds, two methods of capture are widely used: (1) passive netting consisting of monitoring mist-nets frequently to check if a bird has been caught; and (2) target netting consisting of installing a conspecific decoy and/or playing a tape-recorded conspecific song in the vicinity of a mist-net until the territorial bird is captured. Our objective here was to determine whether these methods of capture are effective at achieving non-disturbed baseline corticosterone levels in <b>American</b> <b>Redstarts</b> (Setophaga ruticilla). We found that passive netting was associated with elevated corticosterone levels, suggesting that hanging in a net for several minutes activates the HPA axis and, thus, elicits an adreno-cortical stress response.

Therefore, we suggest that researchers interested in estimated baseline corticosterone in this species use target netting and not passive netting...|$|R
