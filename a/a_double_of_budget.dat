The difference between the real interest rate and the rate of growth of GDP has been negative in 2000 - 2006 and is expected to be negative in the near future suggesting that even a small deficit in primary budget balance can stabilize the debt ratio (30 % of GDP). But in a world of uncertainty even in the Czech republic the capital sector is on net a spout and not a sink (the profit rate has been higher than the investment rate in 1995 - 2008). Hence the czech economy seems to be dynamically efficient and an increase in national saving is necessary. fiscal sustainability, dynamic efficiency, czech data...|$|R
5000|$|The Labor Party {{had gone}} to the {{election}} criticising the previous government for ignoring [...] "long term nation building in favour of short term political spending". One of Albanese's first moves as Minister for Infrastructure and Transport was the establishment of an independent statutory body, Infrastructure Australia, to advise the Government on infrastructure priorities. Armed with advice from this independent body and his own persuasive skills in the Cabinet, he was able to argue for <b>a</b> <b>doubling</b> <b>of</b> the roads <b>budget</b> and a tenfold increase in rail investment. Projects delivered through the Infrastructure Australia process included Melbourne's Regional Rail Link, the Hunter Expressway, the Ipswich Motorway, the Gold Coast light rail system G:link, the Redcliffe Peninsula railway line, the extension of the Noarlunga Centre railway line to Seaford, South Australia and various projects along the Pacific Highway in NSW and Bruce Highway in Queensland.|$|R
40|$|In a {{long-term}} field experiment established in 1962 we investigated {{the influence of}} the application of biowaste derived fertilisers such as sewage sludge (SSL), compost (COM) and farmyard manure (FYM) to a luvisol derived from loess on the contents of PCDD/F and dioxin-like PCB (DL-PCB). 39 years of experimental SSL and COM applications exceeding 4 times the maximal amount as laid down in German legislation resulted in <b>a</b> <b>doubling</b> <b>of</b> the I-TEQ <b>budget</b> for PCDD/F and a 3 fold increase for DL-PCB as compared to test plots amended with mineral fertilizer (MIN) only. As compared to MIN the application of FYM had no effect on the PCDD/F and PCB content in soil. The average contribution of the DL-PCB to the WHO-TEQ were 19 % in the MIN and FYM plots and somewhat higher in the COM (23 %) and in the SSL (27 %) plots. Although the test plots received 4 times the maximum application of SSL as laid down in the German SSL ordinance, and the investigated region represents {{the upper end of the}} topsoil concentrations typically found in Germany, the soils treated with SSL and COM were still a factor of 4 below the German guideline value of PCDD/F for arable land. No enhancement of translocation of PCDD/F and PCB into the corresponding sub-soils due to the presence of dissolved humic matter or other surfactants was observed in the treatments with the different kinds of biowaste. The similarity of congener patterns in all soils, irrespective of the type of fertilizer applied, points towards atmospheric deposition of PCDD/F and DL-PCB as the main intake route in the soils. Moreover, in the case of the SSL and COM plots additional atmospheric deposition from other locations was concentrated and focussed into the amended soils. It is concluded that the common practice of SSL applications in Germany does not pose a current threat to the agro-environment what regards PCDD/F and DL-PCB. However, time trend data on PCDD/F in SSL-amended soils will be needed to obtain a prognosis about the long term effect of biowaste applications on soil quality. JRC. DDG.
