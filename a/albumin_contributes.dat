Albumin {{modified}} by Amadori glucose adducts is a plasma-borne factor that activates cell signaling pathways, modulates {{the expression of}} growth factors and cytokines, and participates in the pathogenesis of microvascular complications of diabetes. In the present study, streptozotocin diabetic rats were treated with an orally administered compound that inhibits the nonenzymatic glycation of albumin to evaluate whether increased glycated <b>albumin</b> <b>contributes</b> to diabetesassociated abnormalities in the vitreous fluid. METHODS. Vitreous obtained from age-matched nondiabetic and streptozotocin-diabetic rats, half of which received the test compound 2 -(3 -chlorophenylamino) phenylacetic acid (23 CPPA) by oral gavage for 26 weeks, was analyzed by immunoassay for pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and glycated albumin content, by measuremen...|$|E
40|$|The {{changes in}} the {{parameters}} of the transporting capacity of albumin, in some biochemical plasma parameters, and in the impact of low-energy laser irradiation on the studied parameters were examined in patients with severe mechanical injury in the early posttraumatic period. Thirty patients aged 17 to 70 years who had a health status of 78 to 98 scores by the APACHE-III scale were examined. The results indicated that as a consequence of prior hypoxia of mixed genesis and subsequent reperfusion and later on due to the development of endogenous intoxication, there were {{changes in the}} transporting capacity of albumin and in the de Ritis coefficient, a reduction in cholesterol concentrations, and increases in the levels of triglycerides and in the activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Early quantum hemotherapy as a part of complex treatment makes it possible to prevent the progressive deterioration of the transporting capacity of plasma albumin, the critical reduction in the effective concentration of <b>albumin,</b> <b>contributes</b> to a more rapid recovery of the lowered levels of cholesterol and to a further increase in the activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, which is indicative of the recovered biosynthetic activity of the liver and its enhanced detoxifying activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{nuclear spin}} {{polarization}} of 129 Xe {{can be enhanced}} by several orders of magnitude by using optical pumping techniques. The increased sensitivity of xenon NMR has allowed imaging of lungs {{as well as other}} in vivo applications. The most critical parameter for efficient delivery of laser-polarized xenon to blood and tissues is the spin-lattice relaxation time (T 1) of xenon in blood. In this work, the relaxation of laser-polarized xenon in human blood is measured in vitro as a function of blood oxygenation. Interactions with dissolved oxygen and with deoxyhemoglobin are found to contribute to the spin-lattice relaxation time of 129 Xe in blood, the latter interaction having greater effect. Consequently, relaxation times of 129 Xe in deoxygenated blood are shorter than in oxygenated blood. In samples with oxygenation equivalent to arterial and venous blood, the 129 Xe T 1 s at 37 °C and a magnetic field of 1. 5 T were 6. 4 s ± 0. 5 s and 4. 0 s ± 0. 4 s, respectively. The 129 Xe spin-lattice relaxation time in blood decreases at lower temperatures, but the ratio of T 1 in oxygenated blood to that in deoxygenated blood is the same at 37 °C and 25 °C. A competing ligand has been used to show that xenon binding to <b>albumin</b> <b>contributes</b> to the 129 Xe spin-lattice relaxation in blood plasma.

40|$|The proteomic {{analysis}} of plasma samples represents a challenge {{as a result}} of the presence of highly abundant proteins such as albumin. To enable the detection of biomarkers, which are commonly low-abundance proteins, in complex blood fluids, it is necessary to remove high-abundance proteins efficiently. Moreover, there is a range of about 10 orders of magnitude for the abundance of different protein species in serum. Here, we describe for the first time a study of reptilian albumin depletion using resins usually used in mammalian plasma depletion procedures. We performed the depletion of albumin from Bothrops jaraca plasma using the HiTrap Blue high-performance column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and the kit Albumin & IgG Depletion SpinTrap column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). In addition, proteomic approaches were used to analyze reptilian plasma. Our results showed that B. jararaca albumin bound to both columns, but those interactions were not enough to remove a large amount of albumin to reach an enrichment of low-abundance proteins. Although the depletion techniques used in this work were not the best to remove B. jararaca plasma albumin, our present work highlights the similarity between B. jararaca and mammalian <b>albumin,</b> <b>contributing</b> to the knowledge of comparative hemostatic proteins...|$|R
40|$|Albumin is {{the most}} {{abundant}} protein (65 kDalton) in human blood plasma. After being produced by the liver, albumin circulates as a polypeptide chain of 585 amino acids which is cross-linked by 17 disulphide bonds. <b>Albumin</b> <b>contributes</b> to about 80 % of the colloid osmotic pressure, and it binds a variety of both self and non-self ligands such as hormones, fatty acids and drugs. Since the 1980 s, {{it is known that}} the excretion of very small amounts of albumin in the urine (20 - 200 mg/L or 30 - 300 mg/day), so called microalbuminuria, predicts the excretion of large amounts of proteins in the urine (proteinuria) in patients with diabetes mellitus. A few years later, microalbuminuria was also proven to be a powerful predictor of mortality in these patients. The clinical application of microalbuminuria as a laboratory risk marker is, to date, restricted to patients with diabetes mellitus. However, recent scientific research has shown that microalbuminuria is also an independent predictor of cardiovascular diseases and mortality in the general population. The underlying mechanism of these results is thought to be generalized endothelial dysfunction, expressed by the kidneys, resulting in ‘leakage’ of albumin into the urine. This endothelial dysfunction can be caused by risk factors such as high bloodpressure, smoking, obesity, and diabetes. Cardiovascular diseases are {{the leading cause of death}} in the Western world. The screening for subjects with an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases is therefore of utmost importance. In this respect, the detection of albumin in the urine plays a very important role. In this thesis we describe the effects of frozen storage of urine samples on the measured albumin concentration (part I). We furthermore explore the different methods of measurement that play a role in the assessment of albumin in urine (part II) ...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc. OBJECTIVES: To develop, optimize, and {{validate}} {{a generalized}} mass action, equilibrium solution that incorporates measured concentrations of albumin {{as well as}} cortisol binding globulin (CBG) to estimate free cortisol. DESIGN AND METHODS: Free cortisol was estimated by Coolens method or by cubic equilibrium equation and compared to measured free cortisol, determined by ultrafiltration method, in subjects with septic shock (n= 45), sepsis (n= 19), and healthy controls (n= 10) at 0, 30, and 60 min following administration of cosyntropin (250 mcg). The data set also included repeat testing in 30 subjects following recovery from sepsis/septic shock. The equilibrium dissociation constant for cortisol binding to albumin (K(A)) was optimized by non-linear regression. The cubic equilibrium solution was also used to model the influence of cortisol, CBG, and albumin concentration on free cortisol. RESULTS: Compared to measured free cortisol, the cubic solution, using an optimized K(A) of 137, 800 nM, was less biased than Coolens solution, with mean percent error of - 23. 0 % vs. - 41. 1 % (paired t test, P< 0. 001). Standard deviation values were also significantly lower (Wilks' test, P< 0. 001) for the cubic solution (SD 35. 8 % vs. 40. 8 % for cubic vs. Coolens, respectively). Modeling studies using the cubic solution suggest an interaction effect by which low concentrations of CBG and <b>albumin</b> <b>contribute</b> to a greater increase in free cortisol {{than the sum of}} their independent effects. CONCLUSIONS: Mass action solutions that incorporate the measured concentration of albumin as well as CBG provide a reasonably accurate estimate of free cortisol that generalizes to conditions of health as well as a setting of hypercortisolism and low CBG and albumin concentrations associated with septic shock. Modeling studies emphasize the significant contribution of albumin deficiency and albumin-bound cortisol under conditions of CBG-deficiency, and identify a synergistic effect by which combined CBG and <b>albumin</b> deficiency <b>contribute</b> to elevation of free cortisol in septic shock.

Urate, ascorbate and <b>albumin</b> <b>contributed</b> 85 % of the total scavenging antioxidant capacity (TAA) which followed a diurnal rhythm (peak 5. 00 pm, nadir 3. 00 am). Salivary antioxidant flow rate was significantly lower in individuals with severe PD (TAA 0. 210 f 0. 02 μM/ml/min) than those with healthy gingivae (TAA 0. 270 ± 0. 02 PM/ml/min) (p< 0. 05). Oxidative injury was greater in the group with severe PD (protein carbonyls = 25. 43 ± 11. 09 fmoles/g protein) compared to the healthy group (7. 77 ± 2. 38 fmoles/g protein) (p< 0. 05). Individuals with low salivary TAA were 4. 5 times more likely to suffer severe PD. TAA in males (654 ± 25 gWral/min) was significantly higher than in females (545 ± 23 pWml/min) (p= 0. 002), but no relationship was noted between sex and periodontal health. TAA and urate flow rates followed the same monthly cyclical pattern as progesterone and ß-estradiol in women. Nutritional antioxidant supplementation was found to have little effect on salivary antioxidant status with only a transient increase in ascorbate evident. These data suggest that severe PD is associated with a decreased salivary antioxidant flow rate and increased oxidative injury. In addition, dietary antioxidant supplementation does not appear to increase salivary antioxidant status as it does in plasma. Toothpastes and mouthrinses containing antioxidants may reduce the extent of oxidative injury in vivo, with more research required in this area.

40|$|Microvessels {{isolated}} from rat epididymal fat exhibit differential vesicular ingestion rates for unmodified and non-enzymatically glycosylated rat albumin. While unmodified rat albumin is excluded from ingestion by endothelial micropinocytic vesicles, glycosylated albumin is avidly {{taken up by}} endocytosis. Interaction of albumin and glycosylated albumin with endothelium was studied with a double-label fluorescence assay of micropinocytosis. When glycosylated albumin was present at a concentration of 6 % with respect to total albumin (the level found in "non diabetic" serum), only glycosylated albumin was ingested. At higher concentrations of glycosylated albumin (those found in diabetic serum), both albumin and glycosylated albumin are ingested. Glycosylation of endothelial membrane components results in stimulated ingestion of glycosylated albumin, persistent exclusion of unmodified albumin, and unaltered micropinocytic ingestion of native ferritin. These results indicate that nonenzymatic glycosylation of serum albumin may result in rapid vesicle-mediated extravasation of albumin. Chronic microvascular leakage of glycosylated <b>albumin</b> could <b>contribute</b> to the pathogenesis of diabetic microangiopathy...|$|R

Materials and methodsThe effects of sclerosants were studied in blood samples obtained from normal individuals. Absorbance densitometry {{was used to assess}} the lytic effects of sclerosants on blood cells and cultured human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) in plasma and in saline. PDMP were quantified by flow cytometry. ResultsHaemolysis occurred in whole blood at sclerosant concentrations greater than 0. 25 % for STS and above 0. 45 % for POL. Similar concentrations of both agents caused platelet and endothelial cell lysis. Both sclerosants released PDMP at low concentrations but destroyed PDMP at higher concentrations. Albumin significantly reduced the lytic effect of both sclerosants on all cells but had a greater inhibitory effect on POL. Protamine at 0. 01 % had a neutralising effect on STS, whereas procaine and lignocaine showed no such activity. ConclusionsSclerosants at therapeutic concentrations lyse blood cells and endothelial cells in vitro. This effect is strongly reduced by serum <b>albumin</b> possibly <b>contributing</b> towards the low incidence of thromboembolic complications of sclerotherapy...|$|R

The influence of the treatments on the pH, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid, tapped density, solubility and hygroscopicity of the powders produced at drying temperatures of 60 ºC and 80 ºC, with addition of albumin and with no albumin were evaluated. Higher values of acidity and lower values of pH were observed for the treatments added with albumin in both temperatures were verified.

Although the intestine has an inherent capability {{to adapt to}} environmental stress, the molecular mechanisms by which the intestine senses and responds to malnutrition are not completely understood. We hereby report that intestinal cell kinase (ICK), a highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase, is a novel component of the adaptive cell signaling responses to protein malnutrition in murine small intestine. Using an experimental mouse model, we demonstrated that intestinal ICK protein level was markedly and transiently elevated upon protein deprivation, concomitant with activation of prominent pro-proliferation and pro-survival pathways of Wnt/b-catenin, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) as well as increased expression of intestinal stem cell markers. Using the human ileocecal epithelial cell line HCT- 8 as an in vitro model, we further demonstrated that serum starvation was able to induce up-regulation of ICK protein in intestinal epithelial cells in a reversible manner, and that serum <b>albumin</b> partially <b>contributed</b> to this effect. Knockdown of ICK expression in HCT- 8 cells significantly impaired cell proliferation and down-regulated active b-catenin signal. Furthermore, reduced ICK expression in HCT- 8 cells induced apoptosis through a caspase-dependent mechanism.

40|$|Plasma paraoxonase is a {{polymorphic}} {{enzyme that}} hydrolyzes paraoxon, the neurotoxic, active metabolite of the insecticide parathion.

A specific assay was developed that measured the activity of human plasma paraoxonase without interference from serum <b>albumin</b> which <b>contributes</b> significantly to the hydrolytic breakdown of paraoxon at the high pH values used in many previous assays. There was an 11 -fold variation in paraoxonase activities, and the population distribution was at least bimodal. However, this specific assay did not improve the discrimination between the three genetic classes: (1) homozygotes for the low-activity allele, (2) heterozygotes, and (3) homozygotes for the high-activity allele. Chlorpyrifos oxon [...] the neurotoxic metabolite of the organophosphorus insecticide chlorpyrifos (Dursban) [...] was hydrolyzed by the same plasma fraction that hydrolyzed paraoxon. There was only four- to fivefold variability in enzyme activity, and the population distribution was unimodal. Homozygotes for low paraoxonase activity ranged over almost the entire spectrum of chlorpyrifos oxonase activity. Possible differences in susceptibility to chlorpyrifos toxicity therefore {{are unlikely to be}} predicted by the paraoxonase genotype alone.

In the present study, we aimed to estimate the serum levels of SP-D in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and to assess the correlation of these biomarkers with indices of COPD severity. Subjects and methods: The study was carried out on 30 COPD male patients and 15 apparently healthy age-matched males as control. COPD patients were divided by GOLD stages into 10 patients stage I–II (group 1), and 20 patients stage III–IV (group 2). A detailed history and clinical examination, pulmonary function testing by spirometry, right ventricular function assessment by conventional echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging were done. Serum levels of total protein and albumin were determined as well as serum SP-D by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in both patient and control groups was determined. Results: The serum level of SP-D was significantly higher in COPD patients than controls (P <  0. 001). Also, these biomarkers were significantly higher in stages III and IV (group 2) compared to stages I and II (group 2) (P <  0. 01). SP-D was significantly negatively correlated with serum albumin (P <  0. 01) and FEV 1 (P <  0. 05) and not correlated with any of right ventricular function indices measured by echocardiography.

30|$|Although {{the main}} cause of death was {{cardiovascular}} disease, the predictive value of diabetes was higher than that of pre-existing cardiovascular disease. A possible explanation is that diabetic condition is associated with several abnormalities such as inflammation, oxidative stress (Basta et al. 2004; Nath et al. 2013) prothrombogenic factors (Kirpichnikov and Sowers 2001), accelerated atherosclerosis (Foley and Parfrey 1998) that lead to cardiovascular complications and poor prognosis in HD patients. In fact, as previously reported (Racki et al. 2007), preexisting CVD were more prevalent in our MHD diabetic patients than in non diabetics. Inflammation is known as an important contributor to PEW in ESRD patients since pro‐inflammatory cytokines stimulate protein catabolism (Bistrian et al. 1992), reduce <b>albumin</b> synthesis and <b>contribute</b> to anorexia (Plata-Salaman 1998). Protein energy wasting is known to be frequent in diabetic dialysis patients (Malgorzewicz et al. 2004) and to interact with inflammation and CVD (de Mutsert et al. 2008).

In this study, we investigated {{whether or not there}} were any significant changes related to in vitro or in vivo glycation in the structural properties and the binding of human albumin to both therapeutic drugs. Structural parameters, including redox state and ketoamine contents of in vitro and in vivo glycated purified albumins, were investigated in parallel with their affinity for warfarin and ketoprofen. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the free drug concentrations and dissociation constants according to the Scatchard method. An alternative method based on fluorescence spectroscopy was also used to assess drug-binding properties. Oxidation and glycation levels were found to be enhanced in albumin purified from diabetic patients or glycated with glucose or methylglyoxal, after determination of their ketoamine, free thiol, amino group and carbonyl contents. In parallel, significant impairments in the binding affinity of in vitro and in vivo glycated albumin, as indicated by the higher dissociation constant values and confirmed by higher free drug fractions, were observed. To a lesser extent, this alteration also significantly affected diabetic albumin affinity, indicated by a lower static quenching in fluorescence spectroscopy.

A larger-scale {{study was conducted}} to identify risk factors of ifosfamide-related encephalopathy, including hepatic function. MethodsAdult patients who had completed at least one cycle of ifosfamide between January 2008 and December 2010 were included. Those with renal failure or liver failure were excluded. Data were collected through chart review. Patients with encephalopathy and patients without encephalopathy were compared on age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), baseline serum creatinine (SCr) level, albumin level, white blood cell count, liver function, brain metastasis, and dosage of ifosfamide. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, Student t test, and univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used for analysis. ResultsThis study enrolled 337 patients. Thirty-eight patients (11 %) had ifosfamide-related encephalopathy. They had poorer ECOG PS; higher SCr level, white blood cell count, and aspartate aminotransferase level; and lower serum albumin level compared with patients without encephalopathy. Ifosfamide dosage, brain metastasis, and age were not significant risk factors. Multivariate analysis indicated that only ECOG PS, SCr level, and <b>albumin</b> level <b>contributed</b> significantly to the risk.

A specific reduction of albumin was identified by 2 -dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Decreased albumin content was also confirmed by immunoblotting and quantitative real-time PCR. Since albumin {{is a major}} and predominant antioxidant in plasma, the PBMC <b>albumin</b> may also <b>contribute</b> to their antioxidant activity. By measuring the amount of H 2 O 2, lipid peroxidation and the redox form of glutathione, {{it was found that the}} production of the oxidative stress was elevated in STZ-diabetic rats compared to that of normal control.

FI significantly correlated with the histological fibrosis stage in both the initial and validation cohort at p= 0. 691 and p= 0. 661, respectively (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, p&# 60; 0. 0001). The sensitivity and positive predictive value of FI at a cutoff value &# 60; 2. 10 for predicting fibrosis stage F 0 - 1 were 66. 8 % and 78. 8 % in the initial cohort and 68. 5 % and 63. 6 % in the validation cohort, respectively. Corresponding values of FI at a cutoff value &# 62;- 3. 30 for the prediction of F 4 were 67. 7 % and 75. 0 % in the initial cohort and 70. 8 % and 81. 0 % in the validation cohort. The fibrosis index comprised of platelet count and albumin level reflected the histological fibrosis stage in patients with chronic hepatitis C. </p...|$|R
40|$|Patients with insulin-dependent {{diabetes}} mellitus (IDDM) have a significantly {{increased risk of}} macrovascular disease, particularly if they have persistent proteinuria. To determine whether altered levels of apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a) ], the plasminogenlike glycoprotein of the potentially atherogenic lipoprotein(a), contribute to the increased risk of atherosclerosis, apo(a) levels were measured in 107 patients with IDDM and compared with nondiabetic control subjects and male elective coronary artery graft patients. Apo(a) levels were increased in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria (geometric mean 245 U/L, 95 % confidence interval [Cl] 142 - 427, n = 30) and albuminuria (mean 196 U/L, 95 % Cl 97 - 397, n = 18) with levels comparable to patients with coronary artery disease (mean 193 U/L, 95 % Cl 126 - 298, n = 40), which were {{higher than in the}} control group (mean 107 U/L, 95 % Cl 85 - 134, n = 140; P = 0. 016). Apo(a) levels in diabetic patients without microalbuminuria (mean 86 U/L, 95 % Cl 63 - 116, n = 59) were comparable with the control population and less than in those with microalbuminuria (P < 0. 001) and albuminuria (P = 0. 014). The elevated apo(a) levels found in patients with IDDM and increased urinary <b>albumin</b> loss may <b>contribute</b> to their heightened risk of macrovascular disease. Diabetes 40 : 787 - 90, 1991 Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is character-ized by an increased risk of macrovascular disease,particularly in patients with persistent proteinuria.

40|$|Kernicterus is an {{irreversible}} {{brain damage}} caused by bilirubin deposition in selective brain regions. Sick and preterm infants with hyperbilirubinemia are particularly susceptible to the condition. We studied autopsied brain tissue from a premature female infant with kernicterus with a bilirubin:albumin molar ratio of 1. 0, hypoxia, acidosis, and seizures. The patient, previously described as having cerebellar axon/myelin loss and angiogenic sprouting, was assessed for histopathological features in brain regions less investigated, such as hippocampus and corpus striatum. Results were compared with age-matched controls. Increased blood vessel density with poorly defined lumen structures was observed in the mesencephalon, pons, and medulla oblongata, and, more predominantly, in the corpus striatum and hippocampus. These two regions exhibited increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, paralleled by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 2, and albumin extravasation into the brain parenchyma. No {{similar findings were observed}} in the nonjaundiced babies with hypoxia that served as controls (one preterm with sepsis and a term infant with pneumonia). We found increased cellular expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 and P-glycoprotein in the hippocampus, known as defensive mechanisms against bilirubin-induced cytotoxicity. Increased density of blood vessels and microvascular permeability, together with parenchymal <b>albumin,</b> may have <b>contributed</b> to increasing the brain content and retention of bilirubin, a condition implicated in kernicterus disease. This novel finding in a premature baby with kernicterus and associated risk factors deserves to be investigated in similar patients to better understand the less-well described effects of bilirubin-induced neurological sequelae in preterm infant...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Impaired {{surfactant}} function {{has been}} demonstrated in patients with asthma. Inhibitory proteins originating from plasma or inflammatory mediators are good candidates to contribute to this dysfunction. Eosinophils are potent effector cells in asthma, which, on activation, release inflammatory mediators, especially reactive granula proteins such as eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). OBJECTIVE: Because the potential role of ECP in the inhibition of surfactant function is not known, we tested the hypothesis of whether ECP levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with asthma after segmental allergen provocation correlate to surfactant dysfunction. Furthermore, we tested the effect of purified ECP on surfactant function and structure in vitro. METHODS: Surfactant isolated from BALF of asthmatic patients was assessed for biophysical function with the Pulsating Bubble Surfactometer and the Capillary Surfactometer and correlated to ECP levels. Purified ECP and plasma proteins at various concentrations were incubated with natural surfactant. Surfactant function was studied with the Capillary Surfactometer, and surfactant structure was determined by electron microscopy. RESULTS: ECP is elevated in BALF from patients with asthma after allergen challenge compared with baseline. ECP levels after allergen challenge correlate well to surfactant dysfunction. In vitro, ECP induces a concentration-dependent inhibition of surfactant function that can be inhibited by antibodies against ECP. ECP is more potent compared with albumin or fibrinogen. Finally, ECP induces severe ultrastructural changes to surfactant vesicles that are more pronounced than changes induced by either fibrinogen or <b>albumin.</b> CONCLUSIONS: ECP <b>contributes</b> to surfactant dysfunction in asthma, which in turn could lead to airway obstruction...|$|R
40|$|And {{so these}} men of Indostan Disputed loud and long, Each {{in his own}} opinion Exceeding stiff and strong, Though each was partly in the right, And all were in the wrong!” JOHN GODFREY SAXEThe {{elephant}} in uremia: Oxidant stress as a unifying concept of cardiovascular disease in uremia. Cardiovascular disease {{is the leading cause}} of mortality in uremic patients. In large cross-sectional studies of dialysis patients, traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia have been found to have low predictive power, while markers of inflammation and malnutrition are highly correlated with cardiovascular mortality. However, the pathophysiology of the disease process that links uremia, inflammation, and malnutrition with increased cardiovascular complications is not well understood. We hereby propose the hypothesis that increased oxidative stress and its sequalae is a major contributor to increased atherosclerosis and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality found in uremia. This hypothesis is based on studies that conclusively demonstrate an increased oxidative burden in uremic patients, before and particularly after renal replacement therapies, as evidenced by higher concentrations of multiple biomarkers of oxidative stress. This hypothesis also provides a framework to explain the link that activated phagocytes provide between oxidative stress and inflammation (from infectious and non-infections causes) and the synergistic role that malnutrition (as reflected by low concentrations of <b>albumin</b> and/or antioxidants) <b>contributes</b> to the increased burden of cardiovascular disease in uremia. We further propose that retained uremic solutes such as beta- 2 microglobulin, advanced glycosylated end products (AGE), cysteine, and homocysteine, which are substrates for oxidative injury, further contribute to the pro-atherogenic milieu of uremia. Dialytic therapy, which acts to reduce the concentration of oxidized substrates, improves the redox balance. However, processes related to dialytic therapy, such as the prolonged use of catheters for vascular access and the use of bioincompatible dialysis membranes, can contribute to a pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative state and thus to a pro-atherogenic state. Anti-oxidative therapeutic strategies for patients with uremia are in their very early stages; nonetheless, early studies demonstrate the potential for significant efficacy in reducing cardiovascular complications...|$|R
