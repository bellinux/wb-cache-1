40|$|The use {{of newly}} {{generated}} murine monoclonal antibodies directed against distinct epitopes of a functionally active, chemically synthesized HIV- 1 Tat protein has permitted {{the identification of}} several molecular forms including monomers, dimers and trimers. Dimers and trimers are particularly stable and resistant to strong reducing conditions.

In contrast, N-terminal, C-terminal and conformation-dependent epitopes are still accessible to mAb specific recognition <b>after</b> <b>Tat</b> oligomerization. Moreover, by using a quantitative HIV-LTR transactivation assay depending upon exogenous Tat, we could extrapolate the amount of functional Tat produced by cell lines stably transfected with the viral transactivator. More importantly, we could show that only the monomeric form of exogenous Tat is the relevant functional form acting in cells harbouring the HIV- 1 LTR promoter...|$|E
40|$|Tat, {{the human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) transactivating protein, binds through its RGD-motif to human integrin receptors. Candida albicans, the commonest cause of mucosal candidiasis in subjects infected with HIV- 1, also possesses RGD-binding capacity. The present study reveals that Tat binds to C. albicans but not to C. tropicalis. Tat binding was markedly reduced by laminin {{and to a lesser}} extent by a complement C 3 peptide containing the RGD motif, but not by a control peptide. The outgrowth of C. albicans was accelerated following binding of Tat, but phagocytosis of opsonized C. albicans was also increased <b>after</b> <b>Tat</b> binding. Thus, Tat binding promotes fungal virulence by inducing hyphae but may also reduce it by augmenting phagocytosis. The net effect of Tat in vivo is difficult to judge but in view of the many disease-promoting effects of Tat we propose that accelerating the formation of hyphae dominates over the augmentation of phagocytosis...|$|E

In this study, we did not find any changes in renal function in animals <b>after</b> <b>TAT</b> (highest cumulative activity used was 11.5  MBq 213 Bi-DOTATATE). Kidney histology was performed in CA 20948 -bearing animals (data not shown), and no significant differences were observed in control vs treated animals. However, 213 Bi-DOTATATE is known to accumulate in the kidney, leading to a high renal-absorbed dose. In patients, the maximum tolerated dose in kidney is postulated to be 23 – 28  Gy [28 – 30]. Kidney protectants during TAT are therefore advised [9, 31, 32], especially when higher treatment activities are used. In another study, we found a maximum tolerated activity of 21.2 [*]±[*] 1.7  MBq in the presence of i.p. l-lysine as kidney protectant prior to the 213 Bi-DOTATATE treatment; in the absence of l-lysine, the maximum tolerated activity was < 13.1 [*]±[*] 1.2  MBq (manuscript in preparation).|$|E
30|$|In {{this pilot}} study, NGAL {{was used as}} a {{biomarker}} to evaluate late-stage renal changes after therapy. NGAL is sensitive to acute kidney injury (AKI) for detection of renal functions in early nephrotoxicity state [16, 34]. No nephrotoxicity was found in the low-dose(−) and low-dose(+) cohorts, corresponding to another study done using similar injected mass of radioactivity (MBq) 213 Bi-DOTATATE as TAT in nude mice in two different tumor models wherein nephrotoxicity was investigated by 99 mTc-DMSA as a kidney marker [35]. Overall, NGAL levels were lower in mice pre-treated with l-lysine than mice without pre-treatment at similar dose of 213 Bi-DOTATATE. However, no significant difference was found between those cohorts, which might be explained since NGAL was measured day 90 <b>after</b> <b>TAT,</b> whereby some repair and recovery of the kidney might already occur. Furthermore, the mean renal absorbed dose for the medium-dose(−) and the high-dose(+) cohorts was 23 and 16  Gy, respectively. These absorbed doses were similar to the calculated renal LD 50, at which 50 % of the treated animals would develop acute nephrotoxicity. The sigmoid dose-effect curve for renal toxicity (Fig.  6) shows a steep slope, contributing to a great variation in NGAL values observed at absorbed doses just above and below the LD 50 value. In this study, NGAL proved to be a valuable tool to examine AKI for TAT using 213 Bi as radionuclide supporting its use in future investigations of nephrotoxicity caused by 213 Bi. The use of NGAL as a biomarker of nephrotoxicity is feasible and cost-effective compared to conventional approaches to determine renal functionality in preclinical studies. Creatinine, the most commonly used parameter to determine kidney injury, lacks the ability to evaluate kidney injury at early stages following PRRT. 99 mTc-MAG 3 and 99 mTc-DMSA for preclinical applications are invasive, by the use of high radioactivity for imaging, and require additional data extraction and analysis. In addition to NGAL, kidney injury molecule- 1 (KIM- 1) and cystatine-C are promising biomarkers for both acute and chronic kidney disease [15]. The ability to study early and late kidney injury is essential in TAT, using a combination of both conventional methods, and these commercially available biomarkers could provide more information leading to more understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in kidney injury <b>after</b> <b>TAT.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{evaluated}} whether motility of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) spindle cells induced by HIV- 1 Tat protein {{is dependent on}} the synthesis of platelet-activating factor (PAF). The results obtained indicate that Tat induced a dose-dependent synthesis of PAF from KS cells at a concentration as low as 0. 1 ng/ml. PAF production started rapidly <b>after</b> <b>Tat</b> stimulation, peaking at 30 minutes and declining thereafter. Tat-induced cell migration was also a rapid event starting at 30 minutes. The motility was abrogated by addition of a panel of chemically unrelated PAF receptor antagonists (WEB 2170, CV 3988, CV 6209, and BN 52021), suggesting that the synthesized PAF mediates the motogenic effect of Tat. This effect was also present on cells plated on a type-I collagen-, fibronectin-, or basement membrane extract-coated surface. Expression of PAF receptor-specific mRNA was detected in KS cells. In addition, examination of the cytoskeletal organization showed that Tat-mediated KS cell redistribution of actin filaments and shape change was also inhibited by a PAF receptor antagonist. Moreover, PAF receptor blockade prevented the up-regulation of β 1 integrin and the down-regulation of αvβ 3 observed after stimulation of KS cells with Tat. In conclusion, {{the results of the present}} study indicate that Tat-induced PAF synthesis plays a critical role in triggering the events involved in motility of KS cells...|$|E

5000|$|The {{description}} {{in terms of}} the continuous state leaky bucket algorithm is given by the ITU-T as follows: “The virtual scheduling algorithm updates a Theoretical Arrival Time (TAT), which is the 'nominal' arrival time of the cell assuming cells are sent equally spaced at an emission interval of T corresponding to the cell rate Λ 1/T when the source is active. If the actual arrival time of a cell is not 'too early' relative to the TAT and tolerance τ associated to the cell rate, i.e. if the actual arrival time is after its theoretical arrive time minus the limit value (ta > TAT - τ), then the cell is conforming; otherwise, the cell is nonconforming" [...] If the cell is nonconforming then TAT is left unchanged. If the cell is conforming, and arrived before its TAT (equivalent to the bucket not being empty but being less than the limit value), then the next cell's TAT is simply TAT + T. However, if a cell arrives <b>after</b> its <b>TAT,</b> then the TAT for the next cell is calculated from this cell's arrival time, not its TAT.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of induction of gene {{expression of the}} human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat (LTR) by the Tat transactivator protein was studied in a cell fusion assay.

This down-regulation of expression occurs in the continued presence of Tat.

40|$|The {{biological}} {{basis for}} the pleiotropic activity of extracellular human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - 1 Tat protein on lymphoid T cell survival is not well understood. We have here demonstrated that the addition in culture of 0. 1 - 10 nM Tat protein to 36 -h serum-starved lymphoblastoid Jurkat T cells rapidly stimulates the catalytic activity of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -K). The peak of activation was observed 30 min <b>after</b> <b>Tat</b> addition. Extracellular Tat also stimulated the catalytic activity of the Akt/PKB kinase, a major target of PI 3 -K lipid products. Pretreatment of serum-starved Jurkat cells with 100 nM wortmannin (WT) or 10 microM LY 294002, two unrelated pharmacological inhibitors of PI 3 -K, markedly suppressed the catalytic activity of both PI 3 -K and Akt/PKB in Jurkat cells. Moreover, at low concentrations (0. 1 - 1 nM), extracellular Tat showed a small but reproducible protection of Jurkat cells from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation (p < 0. 05), while the combination of Tat plus 100 nM WT significantly (p < 0. 05) increased the percentage of apoptosis with respect to cells left untreated or treated with Tat alone. Taken together, {{these data suggest that}} the anti-apoptotic activity of low concentrations of Tat protein on Jurkat cells is mediated by a PI 3 -kinase/Akt pathway...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the ability}} of {{combination}} antiretroviral treatment (cART) to reduce viral burden to nearly undetectable levels in cerebrospinal fluid and serum, HIV- 1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) continue to persist {{in as many as}} half the patients living with this disease. There is growing consensus that the actual substrate for HAND is destruction of normal synaptic architecture but the sequence of cellular events that leads to this outcome has never been resolved. To address whether central vs. peripheral myeloid lineage cells contribute to synaptic damage during acute neuroinflammation we injected a single dose of the HIV- 1 transactivator of transcription protein (Tat) or control vehicle into hippocampus of wild-type or chimeric C 57 Bl/ 6 mice genetically marked to distinguish infiltrating and resident immune cells. Between 8 - 24 hr after injection of Tat, invading CD 11 b(+) and/or myeloperoxidase-positive leukocytes with granulocyte characteristics were found to engulf both microglia and synaptic structures, and microglia reciprocally engulfed invading leukocytes. By 24 hr, microglial processes were also seen ensheathing dendrites, followed by inclusion of synaptic elements in microglia 7 d <b>after</b> <b>Tat</b> injection, with a durable microgliosis lasting at least 28 d. Thus, central nervous system (CNS) exposure to Tat induces early activation of peripheral myeloid lineage cells with phagocytosis of synaptic elements and reciprocal microglial engulfment of peripheral leukocytes, and enduring microgliosis. Our data suggest that a single exposure to a foreign antigen such as HIV- 1 Tat can lead to long-lasting disruption of normal neuroimmune homeostasis with deleterious consequences for synaptic architecture, and further suggest a possible mechanism for enduring neuroinflammation in the absence of productive viral replication in the CNS...|$|E
40|$|A finding {{commonly}} {{observed in}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) -infected patients is invasion of the brain by activated T cells and infected macrophages, eventually leading {{to the development of}} neurological disorders and HIV- 1 -associated dementia. The recruitment of T cells and macrophages into the brain is likely the result of chemokine expression. Indeed, earlier studies revealed that levels of different chemokines were increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of HIV- 1 -infected patients whereas possible triggers and cellular sources for chemokine expression in the brain remain widely undefined. As previous studies indicated that HIV- 1 Tat, the retroviral transactivator, is capable of inducing a variety of cellular genes, we investigated its capacity to induce production of chemokines in astrocytes. Herein, we demonstrate that HIV- 1 Tat 72 aa is a potent inducer of MCP- 1, interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), and IP- 10 expression in astrocytes. Levels of induced IP- 10 protein were sufficiently high to induce chemotaxis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. In addition, Tat 72 aa induced IL- 8 expression in astrocytes. IL- 8 mRNA induction was seen less then 1 h <b>after</b> <b>Tat</b> 72 aa stimulation, and levels remained elevated for up to 24 h, leading to IL- 8 protein production. Tat 72 aa-mediated MCP- 1 and IL- 8 mRNA induction was susceptible to inhibition by the MEK 1 / 2 inhibitor UO 126 but was only modestly decreased by the inclusion of the p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB 202190. In contrast, Tat-mediated IP- 10 mRNA induction was suppressed by SB 202190 but not by the MEK 1 / 2 inhibitor UO 126.

40|$|Extracellular human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Tat protein promotes growth of spindle cells derived from AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma (AIDS-KS), an angioproliferative disease very frequent in HIV- 1 -infected individuals.

40|$|Chronic {{oxidative}} stress {{plays an important}} role in the pathogenesis of HIVassociated dementia (HAD). Like many viruses, HIV- 1 initiates {{oxidative stress}} in infected cells. However, HIV- 1 -derived proteins can also induce oxidative stress in uninfected cell types (e. g., neurons, endothelia and astrocytes), through the release of cytotoxic factors, including nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Mattson et al., 2005). These two molecules generates peroxinitrite, the main cause of a chronic oxidative/nitrosative stress often observed in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, including HAD (Allan Butterfield et al., 2006; Steiner et al., 2006). Moreover, HIV proteins such as gp 120 and Tat are able to activate cell surface receptors such as the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) leading to excitotoxicity (Mattson et al., 2005). Literature data indicated that HIV-Tat is an important neurotoxic effector (Eliseo et al., 2007) being able to activate NMDAR and induce apoptotic neuronal death. In particular, the stimulation of the polyamine-sensitive type of NMDAR is associated with the neurotoxic effects induced by HIVTat (Li et al., 2008). It should be reminded that Tat-induced NMDAR activation stimulate NO production in astrocytes and neuronal cultures (Eliseo et al., 2007). Polyamines are known to be essential for normal cell growth and differentiation, but their oxidative products may act as negative regulators of cell growth and survival. Indeed, many evidences link the products of polyamine degradation to excitotoxicity (Wood et al., 2006) and neurodegeneration (Wood et al., 2007). We hypothesize that HIV- 1 -Tat may induce oxidative stress and cell death through the production of both NO and H 2 O 2, the latter by a mechanism involving polyamine oxidation. A chronic oxidative/nitrosative stress occurs in cells when the production of oxidants exceeds the intracellular antioxidant defences. In the cell, a fundamental antioxidant defence system is represented by the induction of cytoprotective (phase- 2) enzymes, such as Glutathione transferases (GST), Glutamate cysteine lygase (GCL), and Heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1). Under basal conditions, these enzymes are present as a fraction of their full capacity, but the transcription of their cognate genes can be co-ordinately upregulated by exposure to a variety of stimuli, including oxidants, through the activation of a cis-acting enhancer termed antioxidant response element (ARE). ARE-mediated gene activation is coordinated by the Nrf- 2 transcription factor, which is considered a major player orchestrating the antioxidant defence response in the cell. It has been recently reported that Nrf 2 can interfere with the activity of Tat in inducing HIV- 1 LTR transactivation (Hong-Sheng et al., 2009). Thus, we hypothesize that Tat iii may directly affect Nrf 2 -dependent gene expression, likely preventing the neuronal antioxidant cell response (Jeffrey et al., 2007; de Vries et al., 2008). This project was aimed at clarifying the molecular mechanisms of HIV-Tatinduced neuronal toxicity, focusing on the role of polyamine metabolism in Tat-induced oxidative stress and on the activation of the antioxidant response induced by HIV-Tat in astroglial and neuronal cells. The experiments were performed on human astrocytoma (U 373 -MG), neuroblastoma (SH-SY 5 Y) and mouse neuroblastoma (NIE- 115) cell lines. In the first step of the study we carried out experiments to evaluate the role of polyamine oxidases as mediators of oxidative stress in cells treated with HIV-Tat recombinant protein. We found that Tat was able to induce ROS production mainly in neuroblastoma rather than in glioma cells. Accordingly, Tat affected cell viability of only neuronal cells. Astrocytoma cells, indeed appeared completely resistant to the cytotoxic effect of Tat. To evaluate the involvement of polyamine metabolism in the neurotoxicity elicited by Tat we measured ROS content and cell viability in Tatstimulated cells in absence or presence of the polyamine oxidases inhibitors Chlorhexidine (CHX), a structural spermine analogue, affecting the enzymatic activity of SMO (spermine oxidase) and APAO (N 1 -acetyl polyamine oxidase). The results showed that CHX inhibited ROS formation and restored cell viability, suggesting that polyamine degradation products such as H 2 O 2 may be involved in neuronal cell death induced by Tat. In addition, by RT-PCR we evaluated the gene expression of the enzymes involved in polyamine catabolism (SMO, APAO, ODC and SSAT), after treating SH-SY 5 Y with Tat. We found that mRNA levels of enzymes SMO, APAO and SSAT were up-regulated and that SMO activity was higher in HIV-Tat stimulated SH-SY 5 Y cells, respect to the untreated cells. Next, to assess whether the activation of NMDA receptor might play a role in triggering the up-regulation of polyamine metabolism we performed experiments with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK- 801. We observed that MK- 801 pre-treatment of Tat-stimulated cells prevented ROS generation and restored cell viability. Moreover, the NMDA-dependent ROS generation was abolished by CHX pretreatment in SH-SY 5 Y cells. As the neurotoxic effect of HIV-Tat is likely due to the overstimulation of NMDA receptor and concomitant nitric oxide increasing, we tested the effect of the NOS (Nitric Oxidase Sinthase) inhibitor L-NAME on the survival of SH-SY 5 Y cells treated with Tat, demonstrating that L-NAME pre-treatment restored the viability of Tat-treated cells. Our results strongly suggest that the origin of ROS generation could be related to iv spermine/spermidine metabolism. We provided also clearly evidence of the involvement of polyamine-derived hydrogen peroxide in Tat induced neuronal cell death since the specific inhibition of SMO/APAO completely restored cell viability. In regard to the involvement of the NMDA receptor in this pathway we demonstrated that inhibiting polyamine metabolism by specific inhibitor completely prevented NMDA-induced cell death as well as ROS production. HIV is known to progressively deplete GSH content in patients. In our cell culture models we found that Tat treatment caused a significant decrease of GSH levels only in neuroblastoma cells, evidencing an increase of oxidative stress in neurons. Thus in the second step of the project, we analyzed the activation of the antioxidant Nrf 2 /ARE pathway. In particular TransAM assays (DNA-binding ELISA) has been performed to evaluate Nrf 2 transcription factor activation. In this respect, the treatment with Tat was able to activate Nrf 2 in both cell lines. Further, we analyzed the mRNA expression of the ARE-genes coding for HO- 1 and GCL <b>after</b> <b>Tat</b> treatment, by RT-PCR. The results underlined the up-regulation of HO- 1 and GCL-C mRNA levels in U 373 -MG, indicating that the activation of the antioxidant response occurred in astrocytes, but not in neurons. Finally, coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated a physical interaction between Nrf 2 and Tat proteins occurred almost exclusively in SH-SY 5 Y. Our findings clearly show the inability of neuroblastoma cells to activate an efficient antioxidant response even in the presence of activated Nrf 2. Moreover, our preliminary data indicate a different ability of astroglial and neuronal cell lines in releasing Tat. This could result in the accumulation of the viral protein within neuronal cells thus increasing its toxic effect, likely interfering with the cell antioxidant response machinery. On the contrary astrocytes, being able to release the viral protein into the extracellular space, can activate the antioxidant pro-survival response. In conclusion, the obtained results suggest a mechanism by which Tat could modulate the antioxidant response in neurons thus leading to cell death. However, additional studies will be required to obtain a detailed understanding of the specific proteins involved in regulation of this pathway...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{heat shock}} protein gp 96 is an {{endoplasmic}} reticulum chaperone involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress reactions. gp 96 binds antigens and is secreted into extracellular space on cell stress. After reinternalization by antigen presenting cells, antigens can be transferred to major histocompatibility complex molecules. In recent studies, we found induction of gp 96 during differentiation of intestinal macrophages, whereas it was absent in intestinal macrophages of patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: To study immuno-modulating effects of gp 96 in T-cell transfer colitis BALB/c donor mice were injected with 2 × 100 μg gp 96. After 1 week, 2. 5 × 10 (5) CD 4 +CD 62 L+ cells were isolated from spleens and injected into severe combined immunodeficiency recipients. Another group received cells from untreated donors and was treated with 100 μg gp 96 after transfer. Control groups received cells from untreated donors, or buffer alone. RESULTS: After transfer of CD 4 +CD 62 L+ T cells from gp 96 -pretreated donors, mice (TBT gp 96) showed an initial weight loss, but after 3 weeks, they recovered and reached the starting weight after 5 weeks. Mice treated with gp 96 <b>after</b> transfer (<b>TAT</b> gp 96) showed a delayed weight loss {{in comparison with the}} CD 4 +CD 62 L+ group. The histological scores in CD 4 CD 62 L mice were 2. 6 ± 0. 1, in TBT gp 96 mice 1. 3 ± 0. 3 (CD 4 +CD 62 L+ versus TBT gp 96 : P < 0. 05) and in mice treated after transfer 1. 9 ± 0. 1 (CD 4 +CD 62 L+ versus TAT gp 96 : P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate an essential role of gp 96 in the maintenance of tolerance against luminal antigens in the intestinal mucosa. The absence of gp 96 in intestinal macrophages of patients with Crohn's disease might provoke loss of this tolerance mediating mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Background-—Thoracic periaortic {{adipose tissue}} (TAT) is {{associated}} with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and {{may play a role}} in obesity-mediated vascular disease. We sought to determine the prevalence, distribution, and risk factor correlates of high TAT. Methods and Results-—Participants from the Framingham Heart Study (n= 3246, 48 % women, mean age 51. 1 years) underwent multidetector computed tomography; high TAT and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were defined on the basis of sex-specific 90 th percentiles in a healthy referent sample. The prevalence of high TAT was 38. 1 % in women and 35. 7 % in men. Among individuals without high VAT, 10. 1 % had high <b>TAT.</b> <b>After</b> adjustment for age and VAT, both women and men with high TAT in the absence of high VAT were older and had a higher prevalence of CVD (P< 0. 0001) compared with those without high TAT. In addition, men in this group were more likely to be smokers (P= 0. 02), whereas women were more likely to have low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P= 0. 005). Conclusions-—Individuals in our community-based sample with high TAT in the absence of high VAT were characterized by an adverse cardiometabolic profile. This adipose tissue phenotype may identify a subset of individuals with distinct metabolic characteristics.

40|$|Transcription of {{the human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) - 1 {{is controlled by the}} cooperation of virally encoded and host regulatory proteins. The Tat protein is essential for viral replication, however, expression of <b>Tat</b> <b>after</b> virus entry requires HIV- 1 promoter activation. A sequence in the 5 � HIV- 1 LTR, containing a binding site for transcription factors of the interferon regulatory factors (IRF) family has been suggested to be critical for HIV- 1 transcription and replication. Here we show that IRF- 1 activates HIV- 1 LTR transcription in a dose-dependent fashion {{and in the absence of}} Tat. This has biological significance since IRF- 1 is produced early upon virus entry, both in cell lines and in primary CD 4 � T cells, and before expression of Tat. IRF- 1 also cooperates with Tat in amplifying virus gene transcription and replication. This cooperation depends upon a physical interaction that is blocked by overexpression of IRF- 8, the natural repressor of IRF- 1, and, in turn is released by overexpression of IRF- 1. These data suggest a key role of IRF- 1 in the early phase of viral replication and/or during viral reactivation from latency, when viral transactivators are absent or present at very low levels, and suggest that the interplay between IRF- 1 and IRF- 8 may play a key role in virus latency.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tat {{is a key}} HIV- 1 {{virulence}} factor, {{which plays}} pivotal roles in virus gene expression, replication, transmission and disease progression. <b>After</b> release, extracellular <b>Tat</b> accumulates in tissues and exerts effects on both the virus and the immune system, promoting immune activation and virus spreading while disabling the host immune defense. In particular, Tat binds Env spikes on virus particles forming a virus entry complex, which favors infection of dendritic cells and efficient transmission to T cells via RGD-binding integrins. Tat also shields the CCR 5 -binding sites of Env rendering ineffective virus neutralization by anti-Env antibodies (Abs). This is reversed by the anti-Tat Abs present in natural infection or induced by vaccination. FINDINGS: Here we present {{the results of a}} cohort study, showing that the presence of anti-Tat Abs in asymptomatic and treatment-naive HIV-infected subjects is associated with containment of CD 4 + T-cell loss and viral load and with a delay of disease progression. In fact, no subjects with high anti-Tat Ab titers initiated antiretroviral therapy during the three years of follow-up. In contrast, no significant effects were seen for anti-Env and anti-Gag Abs. The increase of anti-Env Ab titers was associated with a reduced risk of starting therapy only in the presence of anti-Tat Abs, suggesting an effect of combined anti-Tat and anti-Env Abs on the Tat/Env virus entry complex and on virus neutralization. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-Tat immunity may help delay HIV disease progression, thus, targeting Tat may offer a novel therapeutic intervention to postpone antiretroviral treatment or to increase its efficacy...|$|R
40|$|HIV-Tat, a conserved protein {{playing a}} key role in the early life cycle of the human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) has been proposed as a potential AIDS vaccine. An HIV-Tat-based vaccine should elicit a broad, long-lasting, and neutralizing immune response. We have previously demonstrated that the adenylate cyclase (CyaA) from Bordetella pertussis targets dendritic cells and delivers CD 8 + and CD 4 + T-cell epitopes into the major histocompatibility complex class I and class II presentation pathways. We have also showed that CyaA induced specific and protective cytotoxic T cell responses in vivo. Here, we designed a prototype vaccine based on the HIV type 1 Tat delivered by CyaA (CyaA-E 5 -Tat) and tested its capacity to induce HIV-Tat-specific cellular as well as antibody responses. We showed that immunization of mice by CyaA-E 5 -Tat in the absence of adjuvant elicited strong and long-lasting neutralizing anti-Tat antibody responses more efficient than those obtained <b>after</b> immunization with <b>Tat</b> toxoid in aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. Analyses of the anti-Tat immunoglobulin G isotypes and the cytokine pattern showed that CyaA-E 5 -Tat induced a Th 1 -polarized immune response in contrast to the Th 2 -polarized immune responses obtained with the Tat toxoid. In addition, our data demonstrated that HIV-Tat-specific gamma interferon-producing CD 8 + T cells were generated after vaccination with CyaA-E 5 -Tat in a CD 4 + T-cell-independent manner. Based on these findings, CyaA-E 5 -Tat represents an attractive vaccine candidate for both preventive and therapeutic vaccination involving CyaA as an efficient nonreplicative vector for protein delivery...|$|R
40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Tat protein activates transcription elongation by stimulating the Tat-activated kinase (TAK/p-TEFb), a protein kinase composed of CDK 9 and its cyclin partner, cyclin T 1. CDK 9 is able to hyperphosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase during elongation. In addition to TAK, the transcription elongation factor Spt 5 {{is required for the}} efficient activation of transcriptional elongation by Tat. To study the role of Spt 5 in HIV transcription in more detail, we have developed a three-stage Tat-dependent transcription assay that permits the isolation of active preinitiation complexes, early-stage elongation complexes, and Tat-activated elongation complexes. Spt 5 is recruited in the transcription complex shortly after initiation. <b>After</b> recruitment of <b>Tat</b> during elongation through the transactivation response element RNA, CDK 9 is activated and induces hyperphosphorylation of Spt 5 in parallel to the hyperphosphorylation of the CTD of RNA polymerase II. However, immunodepletion experiments demonstrate that Spt 5 is not required for Tat-dependent activation of the kinase. Chase experiments using the Spt 5 -depleted extracts demonstrate that Spt 5 is not required for early elongation. However, Spt 5 {{plays an important role in}} late elongation by preventing the premature dissociation of RNA from the transcription complex at terminator sequences and reducing the amount of polymerase pausing at arrest sites, including bent DNA sequences. This novel biochemical function of Spt 5 is analogous to the function of NusG, an elongation factor found in Escherichia coli that enhances RNA polymerase stability on templates and shows sequence similarity to Spt 5...|$|R
40|$|Rat {{pheochromocytoma}} PC 12 {{cells were}} permanently transfected with a plasmid vector, containing the tat gene of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1). Various clones were obtained showing the production of different levels of bioactive <b>Tat</b> protein (<b>Tat)</b> <b>after</b> transient cotransfection with an HIV- 1 long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid. Under conditions of serum starvation, tat-positive PC 12 clones expressing high levels of Tat showed a significantly (P < 0. 05) higher proliferation rate with respect to both mock-transfected PC 12 cells and tat-positive PC 12 cells expressing lower levels of Tat. Moreover, all tat-positive PC 12 cell clones showed a partial morphological differentiation into sympathetic-like neurons, when seeded in low density (5 x 10 (3) cells/cm 2) cultures. On the other hand, mock-transfected PC 12 cells showed the round shaped morphology typical of untreated PC 12 cells and displayed signs of neuronal differentiation only after treatment with 100 ng/ml of nerve growth factor. The addition of 5 micrograms/ml of anti-Tat monoclonal antibody to the culture medium of tat-positive PC 12 cell clones almost completely blocked their increased proliferation rate (P < 0. 05), but did not affect neuronal differentiation. A significant (P < 0. 05) increase in cell proliferation was consistently observed in PC 12 cells supplemented with low concentrations of Tat (5 to 25 ng/ml), whereas neuronal differentiation was hardly affected by exogenous Tat. Our data strongly suggest that Tat exerts a complex influence on the proliferation and differentiation of PC 12 cells, and this might help in increasing understanding of the pathogenesis of the frequent neurological disorders observed in AIDS patients...|$|R
40|$|Vaccination of cynomolgus monkeys {{with the}} biologically active HIV- 1 Tat protein induces {{specific}} Th 1 responses, including CTLs. Similar responses are also induced by vaccination with tat DNA, {{but not by}} vaccination with inactivated Tat or Tat peptides. This suggested that the native Tat protein may act differently on APC as compared with inactivated Tat or peptide Ag. In this study, we show that biologically active Tat is very efficiently taken up by monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) in a time (within minutes) - and dose-dependent (starting from 0. 1 ng/ml) fashion, whereas uptake is very poor or absent with other APC, including T cell blasts and B lymphoblastoid cell lines. Although maturation of MDDC reduces their pino/phagocytic activity, mature MDDC take up Tat much more efficiently than immature cells. In addition, Tat uptake is abolished or greatly hampered by oxidation/inactivation of the protein or by performing the experiments at 4 degrees C, suggesting that MDDC take up native Tat by a receptor-mediated endocytosis. <b>After</b> uptake, active <b>Tat</b> protein induces up-regulation of MHC and costimulatory molecules and production of IL- 12, TNF-alpha, and beta chemokines, which drive Th 1 -type immune response. In contrast, these effects are lost by oxidation and inactivation of the protein. Finally, native Tat enhances Ag presentation by MDDC, increasing Ag-specific T cell responses. These data indicate that native Tat selectively targets MDDC, is taken up by these cells via specialized pathways, and promotes their maturation and Ag-presenting functions, driving Th 1 -type immune responses. Thus, Tat can act as both Ag and adjuvant, capable of driving T cell-mediated immune responses...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) - 1 Tat protein {{plays a key}} role in the pathogenesis of both HIV- 1 -associated cognitive-motor disorder and drug abuse. Dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) function is strikingly altered in patients with HIV- 1 -associated dementia and a history of chronic drug abuse. This study is the first in vitro evaluation of potential mechanisms underlying the effects of Tat protein on DAT function. Rat striatal synaptosomes were incubated with recombinant Tat 1 – 86 protein, and [3 H]DA uptake and the binding of [3 H] 2 β-carbomethoxy- 3 -β-(4 -fluorophenyl) tropane (WIN 35, 428) and [3 H] 1 -[2 -(diphenylmethoxy) ethyl]- 4 -(3 -phenylpropyl) -piperazine (GBR 12935) were determined. Tat decreased [3 H]DA uptake, [3 H]WIN 35, 428 binding, and [3 H]GBR 12935 binding in a time-dependent manner. The potency of Tat for inhibiting [3 H]DA uptake (Ki = 1. 2 μM) was the same as that for inhibiting [3 H]GBR 12935 binding but 3 -fold less than that for inhibiting [3 H]WIN 35, 428 binding. Mutant Tat proteins did not alter [3 H]DA uptake. Kinetic analysis of [3 H]DA uptake revealed that Tat (1 or 10 μM) decreased the Vmax value and increased the Km value in a dose-dependent manner. The Vmax value, decreased by Tat (1 μM), returned to the control level <b>after</b> washout of <b>Tat,</b> indicating that the inhibitory effect of Tat on DA uptake was reversible. Saturation studies revealed that Tat decreased the Bmax value and increased the Kd value of [3 H]WIN 35, 428 binding, whereas Tat decreased the Bmax value of [3 H]GBR 12935 binding, without a change in the Kd value. These findings provide new insight into understanding the pharmacological mechanisms of Tat-induced dysfunction of the DAT in the dopaminergic system in HIV-infected patients...|$|R
40|$|Denture-related {{stomatitis}} (DRS) is {{the most}} common condition affecting removable-denture wearers, and Candida albicans the most frequent pathogenic agent. Systemic antifungal treatment is indicated but recurrences are frequent.

Eighteen patients presenting DRS and treated with fluconazole were followed at the Faculty of Dentistry of Oporto University. Seventy C. albicans isolates were obtained and identified using standard cultural and biochemical multi-testing. Fluconazole susceptibility was tested by E-testÂ®. Microsatellite-primed PCR was performed to assess the genotypic variability of C. albicans isolates. The patientsâ mean age was 58. 0 Â± 3. 2 years, and 55. 6 %/ 44. 4 % had total/partial dentures. Before treatment, 22. 2 %, 44. 4 % and 33. 3 % of the patients presented DRS type I, II or III, respectively. Fluconazole treatment healed or improved DRS in 77. 8 % of the patients, accompanied by an 83. 5 % reduction in oral C. albicans load. However, after 6 -months, oral C. albicans load increased significantly and DRS severity was similar to the one observed before treatment. Moreover, the prevalence of patients presenting fluconazole resistant isolates of C. albicans increased significantly throughout the study: T 0 - 5. 6 %, Tat- 10. 0 % and T 6 m- 42. 9 %. A change in the genotypic variability of C. albicans isolates was also verified, being mostly associated to fluconazole susceptibility profile change. In conclusion, fluconazole presents a good short-term DRS treatment efficiency, but may be associated to a long-term emergence of C. albicans fluconazole resistance.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{spite of}} using heparin-coated extracorporeal circuits, {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass (CPB) is still {{associated with an}} extensive thrombin generation, which is only partially suppressed {{by the use of}} high dosages of heparin. Recent studies have focused on the origins of this thrombotic stimulus and the possible role of retransfused suctioned blood from the thoracic cavities on the activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. The present study was designed to find during CPB an association between retransfusion of suctioned blood from the pericardium and pleural space, containing activated factor VIIa and systemic thrombin generation. Methods Blood samples taken from 12 consenting patients who had elective cardiac surgery were assayed for plasma factor VIIa, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F 1 + 2), and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) concentrations. Blood aspirated from the pericardium and pleural space was collected separately, assayed for F 1 + 2, TAT, and factor VIIa and retransfused to the patient after the aorta occlusion. Results After systemic heparinization and during CPB thrombin generation was minimal, as indicated by the lower than base line plasma levels of F 1 + 2, and <b>TAT</b> <b>after</b> correction for hemodilution. In contrast, blood aspirated from the thoracic cavities had significantly higher levels of factor VIIa, F 1 + 2, and TAT compared to the simultaneous samples from the blood circulation (P 1 + 2, and TAT rose significantly from 1. 6 to 2. 9 nmol/L (P = 0. 002) and from 5. 1 to 37. 5 μg/L (P = 0. 01), respectively. The increase in both F 1 + 2, and TAT levels correlated significantly with the amount of retransfused suctioned blood (r = 0. 68, P = 0. 021 and r = 0. 90, P = 0. 001, respectively). However, the circulating factor VIIa levels did not correlate with TAT and F 1 + 2 levels. Conclusions These data suggest that blood aspirated from the thoracic cavities during CPB is highly thrombogenic. Retransfusion of this blood may, therefore, promote further systemic thrombin generation during CPB. </p...|$|R
40|$|Macrophages and macrophage-like {{cells are}} {{important}} targets of HIV- 1 infection at peripheral sites {{and in the}} central nervous system. After infection, these cells secrete a plethora of toxic factors, including the viral regulatory trans-activating protein (Tat). This protein is highly immunogenic and {{also serves as a}} potent chemoattractant for monocytes. In the present study, the exogenous cannabinoids δ- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and (−) -cis- 3 -[2 -hydroxy- 4 -(1, 1 -dimethylheptyl) phenyl]-trans- 4 -(3 -hydroxypropyl) cyclohexanol (CP 55940) were shown to significantly inhibit migration of human U 937 macrophage-like cells to the Tat protein in a concentration-related manner. The CB 1 receptor-selective agonist N-(2 -chloroethyl) - 5 Z, 8 Z, 11 Z, 14 Z-eicosatetraenamide (ACEA) had no effect on Tat-mediated migration. In contrast, the CB 2 receptor-selective agonist (1 R, 3 R) - 1 -[4 -(1, 1 -dimethylheptyl) - 2, 6 -dimethoxyphenyl]- 3 -methylcyclohexanol (O- 2137) exerted a concentration-related inhibition of U 937 cell migration in response to Tat. Pharmacological blockage of CB 1 receptor signaling using the antagonist 5 -(4 -chlorophenyl) - 1 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 4 -methyl-N-(1 -piperidyl) pyrazole- 3 -carboxamide hydrochloride (SR 141716 A) had no effect on CP 55940 -mediated inhibition of macrophage migration to Tat, whereas treatment with the CB 2 receptor antagonist (1 S-endo) - 5 -(4 -chloro- 3 -methylphenyl) - 1 -((4 -methylphenyl) methyl) -N-(1, 3, 3 -trimethylbicyclo(2. 2. 1) hept- 2 -yl) - 1 H-pyrazole- 3 -carboxamide (SR 144528) reversed the CP 55940 -mediated inhibition of migration. In addition, THC had no inhibitory effect on U 937 migration to <b>Tat</b> <b>after</b> small interfering RNA knockdown of the CB 2 receptor. Collectively, the pharmacological and biochemical knockdown data indicate that cannabinoid-mediated modulation of macrophage migration to the HIV- 1 Tat protein is linked to the CB 2 cannabinoid receptor. Furthermore, these results suggest that the CB 2 cannabinoid receptor has potential to serve as a therapeutic target for ablation of HIV- 1 -associated untoward inflammatory response...|$|R
