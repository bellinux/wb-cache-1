You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking <b>about</b> <b>ourselves</b> too much.|$|E
25|$|Miyagawa’s {{works are}} known for their themes of {{exploring}} memory and finding identity. She said once in an interview, “I believe everything we know <b>about</b> <b>ourselves</b> is entirely based on memory—history, science, art, religion are all constructs of human memory.” Her plays are often written in fluid time and space, rather than in a traditional linear timeline. Many of her works draw from Japanese literature and art forms for inspiration and also employ characters that are ghosts. Her works have explored a variety of issues, such as the interactions between Eastern and Western cultures, feminism, drug addiction, and the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|On {{account of}} the {{evolution}} of society today; text messaging, e-mails, social media, and other technological advancements, have dominated an individual’s sequence of physical interactions. Although technology provides the convenience of connecting with others, its association with the media has resulted in a “platform of delivery in which we intercept and interpret messages <b>about</b> <b>ourselves,</b> our self-worth, and our bodies”. According to a study by Dove, only 4% of women thought they were beautiful, while approximately 70% of women and girls believed the media’s portrayal of impractical beauty standards fuelled their appearance anxieties. As a result, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that, 91% of women were most unhappy with their bodies, while 40% will consider cosmetic surgery to fix their flaws.|$|E

500|$|Ty Burr of the Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a perfect four star rating, {{describing}} it as [...] "ridiculously satisfying", and the [...] "best prequel ever". Burr praised the character {{development in the}} film, opining that [...] "emotionally, Star Trek hits every one of its marks, functioning as a family reunion that extends across decades, entertainment mediums, even blurring the line between audience and show." [...] He continued: [...] "Trading on affections sustained over 40 years of popular culture, Star Trek does what a franchise reboot rarely does. It reminds us why we loved these characters in the first place." [...] Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an 'A-' grade, commenting that director Abrams [...] "crafts an origin story that avoids any hint of the origin doldrums." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, who gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars. He felt that the acting from the cast was {{the highlight of the}} filming, asserting that the performance of Pine radiated star quality. Likewise, Travers called Quinto's performance [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "intuitive", and felt that Quinto [...] "gave the film a soul". Manohla Dargis of the New York Times wrote, [...] "Star Trek [...] isn’t just a pleasurable rethink of your geek uncle's favorite science-fiction series. It's also a testament to television's power as mythmaker, as a source for some of the fundamental stories we tell <b>about</b> <b>ourselves,</b> who we are and where we came from. Slate Dana Stevens felt that the film was [...] "a gift {{to those of us who}} loved the original series, that brainy, wonky, idealistic body of work that aired to almost no commercial success between 1966–69 and has since become a science fiction archetype and object of cult adoration." [...] Time Out London Tom Huddleston praised the aesthetic qualities of the film, such as the design of Enterprise, and praised the performances of the cast. He wrote, [...] "The cast are equally strong: Quinto brings wry charm to an otherwise calculating character, while Pine powers through his performance in bullish, if not quite Shatner-esque fashion." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{critics have}} accused Butler of elitism {{due to her}} {{difficult}} prose style, while others claim that she reduces gender to [...] "discourse" [...] or promotes a form of gender voluntarism. Susan Bordo, for example, has argued that Butler reduces gender to language, contending that the body is {{a major part of}} gender, thus implicitly opposing Butler's conception of gender as performed. A particularly vocal critic has been liberal feminist Martha Nussbaum, who has argued that Butler misreads J.L. Austin's idea of performative utterance, makes erroneous legal claims, forecloses an essential site of resistance by repudiating pre-cultural agency, and provides no normative ethical theory to direct the subversive performances that Butler endorses. Finally, Nancy Fraser's critique of Butler was part of a famous exchange between the two theorists. [...] Fraser has suggested that Butler's focus on performativity distances her from [...] "everyday ways of talking and thinking <b>about</b> <b>ourselves.</b> [...] Why should we use such a self-distancing idiom?" ...|$|E

A well-organised society is one in which we know the truth <b>about</b> <b>ourselves</b> collectively, not one in which we tell pleasant lies about ourselves". Mark Levine, a professor of history at the University of California at Irvine, said that Judt's [...] "writings on European history and the need for a new social contract between rulers and ruled can inspire a new generation of scholars and activists in other cultures". Timothy Garton Ash, in his obituary in the New York Review of Books, placed Judt in [...] "the great tradition of the spectateur engagé, the politically engaged but independent and critical intellectual." ...|$|E
