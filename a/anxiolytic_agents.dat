40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo study {{anxiolytic}} {{property of}} hydro alchohol extract and to estimate polyphenols {{present in the}} extract by HPLC. MethodsTo evaluate anxiolytic property two animal models were used viz. Elevated T maze and hyponeophagia. Diazepam (1 mg/kg body wt.) served as the standard <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent</b> for all the tests. The dried extract of the plant leaf in doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight was administered orally to mice for duration of 15 or 30 days and locomotor and anxiolytic activities were performed. Polyphenols was estimated using HPLC. ResultsThe HPLC analysis of the polyphenols revealed the presence chlorogenic acid, vanillin, epicatechin, caffeic acid, rutin hydrate, sinapic acid, quercetin- 3 -rhamnoside, p-coumeric acid and quercitin. Time spent and number of entries into the open arm was improved in 30 days treated animals than that of 15 days treated groups, 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight treated group showed significant results when comparing with the control group.

50|$|Lometraline (INN; codenamed CP-14,368) {{is a drug}} {{which is}} an aminotetralin derivative. A {{structural}} modification of the investigative neuroleptic pinoxepin, lometraline was originally patented by Pfizer as an antipsychotic, tranquilizer, and antiparkinsonian agent (likely as an anticholinergic).

However, further experimental modifications of the chemical structure of lometraline directly resulted in the discovery of tametraline, a potent inhibitor of the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, which in turn led {{to the discovery of}} the now widely popular antidepressant sertraline, which, remarkably, acts contrarily as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).|$|R
50|$|Pinazepam {{differs from}} other benzodiazepines {{in that it}} has a {{propargyl}} group at the N-1 position of the benzodiazepine structure. It is less toxic than diazepam and in animal studies it appears to produce anxiolytic and anti-agitation properties with limited hypnotic and motor coordination impairing properties. Pinazepam is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The main active metabolites of pinazepam are depropargylpinazepam (N-desmethyldiazepam, nordazepam) and oxazepam. In humans pinazepam acts as a pure <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent</b> in that it does not possess to any significant degree the other pharmacological characteristics of benzodiazepines. Its lack of intellectual, motor and hypnotic impairing effects makes it more appropriate than other benzodiazepines for day time use. The elimination half-life is longer in the elderly.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the effect of}} pregabalin (previously S-Isobutylgaba and CI- 1008) in two distinct rat models of anxiety. Pregabalin binds with high affinity and selectivity to the α 2 δ subunit of voltage dependent calcium channels (VDCC). Its corresponding R-enantiomer (R-isobutylgaba) is approximately 10 fold weaker. Pregabalin dose-dependently induced anxiolytic-like effects in both the rat conflict test and elevated X-maze with respective minimum effective doses (MED) of 3 and 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1. In contrast, R-isobutylgaba only showed activity at the highest dose of 100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 in the conflict test.

Anxiety was measured by using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and the anxiety subscale of the Basic Symptom Inventory within 72 hours of admission. • RESULTS Smokers reported higher anxiety levels than nonsmokers reported on both anxiety scales. Female smokers reported the highest anxiety and peak pain levels of all, yet women were {{the least likely to}} receive <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents.</b> Smoking status was not a predictor for anxiety level when sex, peak pain, use of β-blockers in the hospital, and age were controlled for.

30|$|The NMDA-type {{glutamate}} receptor antagonist ketamine holds {{promise as}} a suitable anesthetic for GABAA receptor PET studies, as subanesthetic ketamine doses {{were shown to}} have minimal effect on [11 C]flumazenil binding in the human brain [32]. Furthermore, ketamine treatment did not increase interstitial GABA levels in an MR spectroscopy study in healthy humans [33], however, more recent studies showed increases in humans with obsessive compulsive disorder [34] and major depressive disorder [35]. The α 2 -adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine is an <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agent</b> often used to sedate children undergoing MRI scans [36]; however, synergistic interactions between α 2 -adrenergic agonists and benzodiazepine binding sites on GABAA receptors have been described [37].

40|$|Substance P (neurokinin- 1 [NK 1]) {{receptor}} antagonists {{appear to}} be effective antidepressant and <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents,</b> as indicated in 3 double-blind clinical trials. In laboratory animals, they promptly attenuate the responsiveness of serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine [5 -HT]) and norepinephrine (NE) neurons to agonists of their cell-body autoreceptors, {{as is the case}} for some antidepressant drugs that are currently in clinical use. Long-term, but not subacute, antagonism of NK 1 receptors in rats increases 5 -HT transmission in the hippocampus, a property common to all antidepressant treatments tested thus far. This enhancement seems to be mediated by a time-dependent increase in the firing rate of 5 -HT neurons. Mice with the NK 1 receptor deleted from their genetic code also have an increased firing rate of 5 -HT neurons. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that NK 1 antagonists could become a new class of antidepressant and <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|E
40|$|Withdrawal of <b>anxiolytic</b> <b>agents</b> such as ethanol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines {{may result}} in a {{syndrome}} characterised in its most severe form by delirium and seizures. There is increasing evidence that anxiolytic drugs produce their pharmacological effects by enhancing brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission. During long-term exposure to anxiolytics, brain GABA synapses show evidence of adaptive changes which would tend to reduce the effect of the anxiolytic and restore normal GABA function. Abrupt cessation of anxiolytic treatment might therefore lead to an acute reduction in GABA function; this change could underlie the severe symptoms associated with tranquilliser withdrawal...|$|E

BIBO 3304 did not attenuate MK- 801 -induced anxiolysis and �-helical CRF abolished NMDA-induced anxiogenesis.
