In return for security guarantees, military aid, and financial <b>assistance</b> <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> from the United States and Russia, Kazakhstan had surrendered all nuclear weapons to Russia by May 1995. Both Belarus and Ukraine resisted full implementation of the protocol during the 1990s, wishing to retain a nuclear deterrent force or a diplomatic bargaining chip. However, Belarus was economically dependent on Russia and eventually carried out its agreement to transfer all nuclear weapons to Russia. Like Kazakhstan, Ukraine eventually agreed to surrender its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees, military aid, financial <b>assistance,</b> <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> from the United States and Russia. Implementation of the Lisbon Protocol was complete when both Belarus and Ukraine had surrendered their nuclear weapons to Russia by the end of 1996.|$|E

40|$|When they {{experience}} service failures, customers look for causes. They {{seek to understand}} whether the service firm could have prevented the failure (controllability attribution) and whether {{the cause of the}} failure is temporary or constant over time (stability attribution). To understand such attributions we perform a meta-analysis. We find that causal attributions are related to emotional and cognitive reactions in several ways. First, controllability attributions elicit stronger negative emotions than do stability attributions. Second, controllability attributions directly affect only transaction-specific satisfaction, whereas stability attributions directly affect customers’ transaction-specific and overall satisfaction. Third, both attributions affect loyalty and negative word-of-mouth through negative emotions, overall satisfaction, and transaction-specific satisfaction. Finally, contextual (i. e., cultural values), methodological (i. e., participants), and measurement factors (i. e., measurement scale) partly explain studywise variation in the effects of attributions on customer outcomes. We recommend that companies manage reactions to service failure thrice: before customers formulate attributional beliefs, using fast and accurate communication, when the attributional beliefs are formed, offering employee <b>assistance</b> <b>and</b> <b>compensations,</b> <b>and</b> well after the attributional beliefs are established, providing feedback on process improvements by the company. status: publishe...|$|R

In early 2008, the government paid for the repatriation of over 200 Sri Lankan domestic workers from safe houses in the Middle East. For repatriated Sri Lankan victims, however, there is little government effort to investigate the crimes committed against them. Limited aid is offered in terms of shelter, counseling, and medical care upon return. The government opened two temporary shelters {{for women who are}} victims of violence, and these were made available to trafficking victims.

40|$|The central {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the income sources and patterns of prime-age and older workers who suffer a layoff from steady employment. We focus on a set of cohorts who are deemed to have a high degree of attachment to the labour force preceding the event of an involuntary separation. Using a unique data base that merges administrative data marking the job separation, we track all of their sources of income over an interval that spans four years prior to the separation to five years after the separation. Our empirical analysis includes an investigation of the frequency that a laid-off individual will receive income ex post from a given source, a typology analysis of the various configurations of income received, and an econometric analysis of the incidence of certain post-layoff income configurations. We find that in any given year, approximately 2 % of our sample of workers with stable employment histories experience a ‘visible’ layoff. During the first three post-layoff years, 77 % of the group of laid-off workers (aged 45 - 64 years old) have non-trivial labour market earnings, and 56 - 65 % of them depend on the labour market for their primary source of income. This group of workers does experience substantial income losses. During the post-layoff period, approximately 14 - 19 % of them file a subsequent claim for EI benefits, but few of them depend on the EI regime as the primary source of their income. Very few of these individuals draw on other types of social insurance benefits, such as CPP disability, social <b>assistance,</b> <b>and</b> workers’ <b>compensation.</b> The most common destination state for prime-age and older workers who have not yet reached retirement age are early retirement and continued labour market activity, albeit at much lower earnings. It is rare for them to draw on social insurance benefits, and we find little evidence that disability benefits <b>and</b> workers <b>compensation</b> are functioning as disguised unemployment benefits.

40|$|AbstractMost provincial {{emergency}} management legislation (Quebec excepted) fails to include regulatory guidelines {{as to how}} local authorities reduce community vulnerability. This exposes individual(s) and groups to greater vulnerability to disasters if the local authority decides not to act or provide inadequate management. In addition, access to financial resources to assist or compensate local governments and/or private landowners for damages endured often come with attachments or do not exist. When damages result from a government's action or inaction {{in the event of}} an emergency, provisions in provincial legislation and court findings have reduced government exposure to civil liability at common law further exposing private landowners to financial risk. This paper argues that a lack of standards in {{emergency management}} legislation, restrictive access to financial <b>assistance</b> and/or <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> reduced government exposure to civil liability at common law expose private landowners to greater vulnerability to disasters and the liability attached. It is essential that those responsible for proactive/preventative planning for disasters work from a standard playbook, one which sets minimum safeguards for the public.

40|$|International reward <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> has {{received}} little academic attention, but past research was mainly conducted in advanced Western economies. This study explores {{the extent to}} which multinational enterprises (MNEs) from an emerging economy, South Korea, transfer reward <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> practices from business headquarters to a transitional economy, China and the determining factors for transfer. Using a qualitative approach to analysing 10 South Korean MNEs in China, this study reveals that the sample companies adopt home-oriented focal reward <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> policies <b>and</b> practices (including base pay and performance-based pay) and an integrative approach to peripheral components (including allowances and benefits) for expatriates. However, the companies adopt an integrative approach to focal components of reward <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> a localized approach to peripheral components for host country nationals (HCNs).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Violent {{crime is}} on the {{increase}} in Britain, with 17 % of the 15 million incidents of crime reported in 1991 being of a violent nature. Although there is some information {{on the role of}} accident and emergency departments for victims who sustain physical injury, {{little is known about the}} role of the general practitioner (GP) in managing the acute and longer-term sequelae of violence. AIM: To examine the links between experiencing physical of sexual assault and seeking help from GPs in London. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey of all adult attendees in one large group practice was carried out. The main outcome measures were prevalence of assault, reporting to the doctor and other people, and scores on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and the Impact of Events scale. RESULTS: Of the 195 people who took part, 33 (17 %) reported a physical or sexual assault in the previous year. Women were three times more likely than men to report any type of assault. Women rarely spontaneously disclosed these experiences to the GP and yet the experience of violence was associated with higher levels of distress, as measured on the GHQ and the Impact of Events Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Assault is a relatively common event in the lives of people who consult their GP. Doctors could help these patients through gaining an awareness of the problem and by fostering links with voluntary services, such as victim support schemes, which can provide support, practical <b>assistance,</b> <b>and</b> advice on <b>compensation</b> claims <b>and</b> legal procedures...|$|R
