An {{important part of}} the history of skiing, the races was a forerunner of the downhill ski race.

25|$|After {{celebrating the}} birth of his son, the first child with Morgan Beck, Miller {{announced}} in October, that he would skip another season with the intention {{to spend more time with}} his family and to focus on his new-found passion of horse training. Even though some people started to suspect that this might mean the end of his skiing career, Miller denied it in December stating that although he would never do the full circuit again, there's a likelihood that he'd return to racing occasionally. He terminated his contract with HEAD early under the restriction to not compete with other skis than HEAD in the World Cup circuit or World <b>Alpine</b> <b>Ski</b> Championships.

25|$|In para-Alpine skiing, {{the skier}} uses a mono-ski, which is {{required}} to have breaks {{on both sides of}} the ski. The para-Nordic sit-ski configuration has two skis. Skiers in this class use outrigger skis for balance, as leverage to right themselves when they fall, and for turning. A factoring system is used in the sport to allow different classes to compete against each other when there are too few individual competitors in one class in a competition. Factoring for the 2011/2012 <b>alpine</b> <b>ski</b> season was done based on subclass, with LW10.1 factoring being 0.7234 for Slalom, 0.7794 for Giant Slalom, 0.7942 for Super-G and 0.8004 for downhill, and LW10.2 factoring being 0.7399 for Slalom, 0.8152 for Giant Slalom, 0.8069 for Super-G and 0.8183 for downhill. The percentage for the para-Nordic 2012/2013 ski season was 86% and for LW10.5 was 91%.|$|E

Many Chinese professionals of biology and environmentalists deemed that if the Olympic venues are developed in such area, the rare species and integrated ecological environment will be catastrophically collapsed. Chinese government intended to remove such area out from the range of the natural reserves and chose some other area with few rare species as the reserves. Besides, the comments regarding the strict compliance with laws and protection of Songshan National Reserves are widely deleted or restricted in China. All these actions have been criticized by some media and the professionals of biology in China.|$|E
