Irving Sandler used it as the frontispiece and rear dust jacket photograph of his The Triumph of American Painting: A History of <b>Abstract</b> <b>Expressionism,</b> published in 1970. This book defined <b>Abstract</b> <b>Expressionism</b> for a generation of scholars.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} of his Brushstrokes works, it is in part a satirical {{response}} to the gestural painting of <b>Abstract</b> <b>Expressionism.</b> Like most of Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dots works it is a depiction of mechanical reproduction via painterly technique. In this case, the satire comes from the depiction of the graphical depiction of the spontaneous painting motion in painstaking painterly detail.|$|E
5|$|When he {{performed}} with the Beatles in Hamburg, he met photographer Astrid Kirchherr, to whom he was later engaged. After leaving the Beatles, he enrolled in the Hamburg College of Art, studying under future pop artist Eduardo Paolozzi, who later wrote a report stating that Sutcliffe {{was one of his}} best students. Sutcliffe earned other praise for his paintings, which mostly explored a style related to <b>abstract</b> <b>expressionism.</b>|$|E

Materialist film’s direct methods reproduce <b>Abstract</b> <b>Expressionism’s</b> essentialism in {{painting and sculpture}} and {{can be related to}} Samuel Beckett’s minimalism, of which Gidal has also written. Gidal’s texts are recounted in relation to the splitting of the avant-garde in two by Peter Wollen in 1975, a move that subjugated materialist film in favour of an emergent feminist counter cinema...|$|R
5000|$|Merz {{discarded}} <b>abstract</b> <b>expressionism’s</b> subjectivity {{in favor}} of opening art to exterior space: a seed or a leaf in the wind becomes a universe on his canvas. From the mid-1960s, his paintings echoed his desire to explore the transmission of energy from the organic to the inorganic, a curiosity {{that led him to}} create works in which neon lights pierced everyday objects, such as an umbrella, a glass, a bottle or his own raincoat. Without ever using ready-made objects as [...] "things" [...] (at least {{to the extent that the}} Nouveau Realistes in France did), Merz and his companions drew the guiding lines of a renewed life for Italian art in the global context.|$|R
5|$|Look Mickey (also {{known as}} Look Mickey!) is a 1961 {{oil on canvas}} {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. Widely regarded as the bridge between his <b>abstract</b> <b>expressionism</b> and pop art works, it is notable for its ironic humor and aesthetic value {{as well as being}} the first example of the artist's employment of Ben-Day dots, speech balloons and comic imagery as a source for a painting. The painting was bequeathed to the Washington, D.C., National Gallery of Art upon Lichtenstein's death.|$|E
5|$|Paris {{continued}} to be a major destination for Scottish artists, with William Gear (1916–97) and Stephen Gilbert (1910–2007) encountering the linear abstract painting of the avant-garde COBRA group there in the 1940s. Their work was highly coloured and violent in execution. Also a visitor to Paris was Alan Davie (b. 1920-2014), who was influenced by jazz and Zen Buddhism, and moved further into <b>abstract</b> <b>expressionism.</b> Ian Hamilton Finlay's (1925–2006) work explored the boundaries between sculpture, print making, literature (especially concrete poetry) and landscape architecture. His most ambitious work, the garden of Little Sparta opened in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Brushstrokes {{series is}} the name {{for a series of}} {{paintings}} produced in 196566 by Roy Lichtenstein. It also refers to derivative sculptural representations of these paintings that were first made in the 1980s. In the series, the theme is art as a subject, but rather than reproduce masterpieces as he had starting in 1962, Lichtenstein depicted the gestural expressions of the painting brushstroke itself. The works in this series are linked to those produced by artists who use the gestural painting style of <b>abstract</b> <b>expressionism</b> made famous by Jackson Pollock, but differ from them due to their mechanically produced appearance. The series is considered a satire or parody of gestural painting by both Lichtenstein and his critics. After 1966, Lichtenstein incorporated this series into later motifs and themes of his work.|$|E

5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century {{movement}} {{in the tradition of}} European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene. Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the <b>abstract</b> <b>expressionism</b> of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern art}} {{movement}} in the country officially emerged in the 1950s, culminating {{in the establishment of}} an art society. Expressionism and surrealism, as well as calligraphic art are the popular forms of art in the country. <b>Abstract</b> <b>expressionism</b> has gained popularity in recent decades. Pottery-making and textile weaving are also popular products that were widely made in Bahraini villages. Arabic calligraphy grew in popularity as the Bahraini government was an active patron in Islamic art, culminating in the establishment of an Islamic museum, Beit Al Quran. The Bahrain national museum houses a permanent contemporary art exhibition. The architecture of Bahrain {{is similar to that of}} its neighbours in the Persian Gulf. The wind tower, which generates natural ventilation in a house, is a common sight on old buildings, particularly in the old districts of Manama and Muharraq.|$|E

25|$|Color Field {{painting}} {{is related to}} Post-painterly abstraction, Suprematism, <b>Abstract</b> <b>Expressionism,</b> Hard-edge painting and Lyrical Abstraction. It initially referred to {{a particular type of}} <b>abstract</b> <b>expressionism,</b> especially the work of Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Robert Motherwell, Adolph Gottlieb and several series of paintings by Joan Miró. Art critic Clement Greenberg perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting.|$|E
25|$|Lyrical {{abstraction}} shares similarities {{with color}} field painting and <b>abstract</b> <b>expressionism</b> {{especially in the}} freewheeling usage of paint — texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in <b>abstract</b> <b>expressionism</b> and color field painting. However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from <b>abstract</b> <b>expressionism</b> and action painting of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in action painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in lyrical abstraction {{there is a sense}} of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.|$|E
25|$|Post-Second World War American {{painting}} called <b>Abstract</b> <b>expressionism</b> included {{artists like}} Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, Mark Rothko, Hans Hofmann, Clyfford Still, Franz Kline, Adolph Gottlieb, Barnett Newman, Mark Tobey, James Brooks, Philip Guston, Robert Motherwell, Conrad Marca-Relli, Jack Tworkov, William Baziotes, Richard Pousette-Dart, Ad Reinhardt, Esteban Vicente, Hedda Sterne, Jimmy Ernst, Bradley Walker Tomlin, and Theodoros Stamos, among others. American <b>Abstract</b> <b>expressionism</b> {{got its name}} in 1946 from the art critic Robert Coates. It is seen as combining the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as Futurism, the Bauhaus and Synthetic Cubism. <b>Abstract</b> <b>expressionism,</b> Action painting, and Color Field painting are synonymous with the New York School.|$|E

5000|$|Art critic Florentina Lungu credits Sonmor for {{creating}} a new pictorial language which is both representational and symbolic. Describing his style as [...] "postmodern with neo-romantic accents" [...] in the journal Vie des Arts, Lungu identified in Sonmor's work the influence of mid 20th-century <b>abstract</b> art, <b>expressionism,</b> pop art, and American conceptual artists Clyfford Still and Barnett Newman, {{as well as the}} still lifes of Velasquez, Caravaggio, and the 17th-century Dutch painters. Describing Sonmor as [...] "an aesthetician's painter", Mark Daniel Cohen wrote, [...] "What matters about them is not their art historical references but their tonality, their emotional aura, the atmospheric quality they emit." [...] For curator David Liss, [...] "Kevin Sonmor's paintings are charged with unsettling tensions between ambiguity and meaning, historic traditions and the contemporary condition, between nature and culture, tragedy and possibility, process and finished product." [...] In Vie des Arts, reviewer Anne Severson also noted that these [...] "apparent contradictions suggest a mysterious, otherworldly character of spiritually".|$|R
5000|$|Although he had {{interest}} in art at age 15, he began artistic {{training at the}} Academy of San Carlos in 1942, when he was 24, {{at the height of}} the Mexican muralism movement.

[...] Either as teachers or working for them as assistants, Nishizawa had various mentors such as José María Velasco, Julio Castellanos, José Chávez Morado, Alfredo Zalce and Benjamin Correa [...] Although nationalism was the prevailing sentiment in artistic production in the 1940s, he studied other movements such as <b>expressionism,</b> <b>abstract</b> art and figurativism as well. He received his masters in fine arts in 1947.|$|R

40|$|Dan Rees {{engages with}} a {{tradition}} of conceptual art making, in which familiar tropes and genres – monochromes, abstracts, ready-mades – are quietly unhinged and recuperated as strategies for production. The exhibition’s central series of Artex Paintings revive a decorative ceiling pattern, popular in British working class homes during the 1970 s. Creating this type of plasterwork, once a skilled manual job, has now been rendered all but redundant as the material fell out of fashion during the late 1980 s. Rees’ methodology is driven through both {{a recognition of the}} steady disappearance of the working class over recent decades and the overwriting of much of its history, as much of the disappearance of artex as a decorative mean itself. Within Rees’ paintings, distinctive shell-like patterns are combed through energetically coloured fields. Incidental manifestations within the fluid oil register against the formal exercise of combing, which both obliterates and transforms the painted surface beneath. Devoid of saturated images or commercial slogans, the impersonal forms of Rees’ Trivision Billboards punctuate the exhibition. With their industrial and austere presence, they simulate or disguise themselves as minimalist sculptures. Placed variously on the walls and floors of the gallery spaces, their repetition suggests how they might be ordered in manifold sizes and formations. However, while minimalist objects traditionally asked to be considered as materials without reference to an outside reality, Rees undermines this logic by presenting a mechanism intended to broadcast information. Similarly, the Artex Paintings could be understood as a deliberate subversion of <b>abstract</b> <b>expressionism’s</b> themes, in which gestural spontaneity has been rendered via the methodical repetitions of a builder’s tool. In Rees’ continued examination of reproduction and repetition, the work enters the format of a series, removing it from wry conceptual exercise. While the abstract works of the Artex Paintings and the minimalism of the billboards do not project the artist’s ideology directly, this is more clearly revealed in Rees’ video work Road Back To Relevance. Produced in collaboration with an advertising strategist and designer, the slide-show questions of how various modes of social engagement can remain relevant today by charting the course of a specific solidarity campaign, started in the 1980 s between Wales and Nicaragua. While the visual tone of this work might suggest a need for such solidarity campaigns to modernise in order to reach a wider audience, the conclusion appears to be the opposite. Rather, the work points to the relevance of maintaining an inclusive and personal approach towards creating new connections between people, one that goes beyond issues of technology and dispersion. Dan Rees (born 1982, UK) lives and works in Berlin. Solo exhibitions include Stimulate Surprise at Tanya Leighton Gallery, Berlin (2015); Kelp at MOSTYN, Wales and at The National Museum of Wales, Cardiff (2013); Gravel Master at The Goss-Michael Foundation, Dallas (2013); Philanthropy at Jonathan Viner, London (2011); French Cricket at Tanya Leighton, Berlin (2010); They Don't Make Them Like This Anymore at T 293, Naples (2009) and Alan Brooks and Dan Rees at MOT International, London (2008) ...|$|R
25|$|Painting has {{continued}} to be a prominent form of artistic expression in Danish culture, inspired by and also influencing major international trends in this area. These include impressionism and the modernist styles of <b>expressionism,</b> <b>abstract</b> painting and surrealism. While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes De Tretten (1909–1912), Linien (1930s and 1940s), COBRA (1948–51), Fluxus (1960s and 1970s), De Unge Vilde (1980s) and more recently Superflex (founded in 1993). Most Danish painters of modern times have also been very active with other forms of artistic expressions, such as sculpting, ceramics, art installations, activism, film and experimental architecture. Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various art movements include Theodor Philipsen (1840–1920, impressionism and naturalism), Anna Klindt Sørensen (1899–1985, expressionism), Franciska Clausen (1899–1986, Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others), Henry Heerup (1907–1993, naivism), Robert Jacobsen (1912–1993, abstract painting), Carl Henning Pedersen (1913–2007, abstract painting), Asger Jorn (1914–1973, Situationist, abstract painting), Bjørn Wiinblad (1918–2006, art deco, orientalism), Per Kirkeby (b. 1938, neo-expressionism, abstract painting), Per Arnoldi (b. 1941, pop art), Michael Kvium (b. 1955, neo-surrealism) and Simone Aaberg Kærn (b. 1969, superrealism).|$|R

Danish photography has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the art of photography in 1839 to the success of a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today. Pioneers such as Mads Alstrup and Georg Emil Hansen paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during {{the last half of the}} 19th century. Today Danish photographers such as Astrid Kruse Jensen and Jacob Aue Sobol are active both at home and abroad, participating in key exhibitions around the world.|$|R
