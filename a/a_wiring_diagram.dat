40|$|Tract-tracing {{experiments}} {{are considered the}} gold standard {{when it comes to}} revealing structural connectivity in the brain. They provide a direct measurement of the axonal tracts of the neuron(s) with axons that start or terminate close to the injection site. Rapid developments in tracing techniques have resulted in a large body of literature, in which each publication describes a few experiments with a given protocol, species and brain atlas. For mouse, several large scale studies are under way in which brain-wide connectivity is measured with an automated tracing and analysis workflow. For ethical reasons however, such initiatives are unlikely to be applied to large mammals. The alternative is to rely on databases which combine findings from individual publications. We focus on a prime example of such a database: the CoCoMac collation of Macaque connectivity. Can the very diverse set of experimental protocols and nomenclatures be combined into <b>a</b> reliable <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> of the brain? To study this, we built a new online platform for CoCoMac (cocomac. g-node. org) [1] with two essential components: (1) <b>a</b> custom <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> builder, in which every detail of the included tracing experiment can be specified; and (2) a graphical nomenclature consistency tool, in which conflicting naming schemes can be resolved interactively. In this talk I will show that small errors in relating brain regions across atlases can have a detrimental effect on the resulting <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram.</b> With the consistent nomenclature, we continue to show different views of the connectivity matrix, such as retrograde vs. anterograde, intralateral vs. contralateral and with and without certain types of tracer. Finally we study the variability of the matrix by leaving out random subsets of tracing data. This variability predicts the effect of adding new data to CoCoMac, and indicates which brain regions require special attention...|$|R

40|$|SummaryNeuronal growth cones select {{synaptic}} partners through {{interactions with}} multiple cell surfaces in their environment. Many of these interactions are adhesive, {{yet it is}} unclear how growth cones integrate adhesive cues to direct their movements. Here, we examine the mechanisms that enable photoreceptors in the Drosophila visual system to choose synaptic partners. We demonstrate that the classical cadherin, N-cadherin, and an atypical cadherin, Flamingo, act redundantly to instruct the targeting choices made by every photoreceptor axon. These molecules gradually bias the spatial distribution of growth cone filopodia, polarizing each growth cone toward its future synaptic target before direct contact with the target occurs. We demonstrate that these molecules are localized to distinct subcellular domains and create a network of adhesive interactions distributed across many growth cones. Because this network comprises multiple redundant interactions, <b>a</b> complex <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> can be constructed with extraordinary fidelity, suggesting a general principle...|$|R

Each type of switch has a different symbol {{and so do the}} various outlets. There are symbols that show the location of smoke detectors, the doorbell chime, and thermostat. On large projects symbols may be numbered to show, for example, the panel board and circuit to which the device connects, and also to identify which of several types of fixture are to be installed at that location.|$|R

40|$|The {{function}} of a neural circuit {{is determined by the}} details of its synaptic connections. At present, the only available method for determining <b>a</b> neural <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> with single synapse precision-a 'connectome'-is based on imaging methods that are slow, labor-intensive and expensive. Here, we present SYNseq, a method for converting the connectome into a form that can exploit the speed and low cost of modern high-throughput DNA sequencing. In SYNseq, each neuron is labeled with a unique random nucleotide sequence-an RNA 'barcode'-which is targeted to the synapse using engineered proteins. Barcodes in pre- and postsynaptic neurons are then associated through protein-protein crosslinking across the synapse, extracted from the tissue, and joined into a form suitable for sequencing. Although our failure to develop an efficient barcode joining scheme precludes the widespread application of this approach, we expect that with further development SYNseq will enable tracing of complex circuits at high speed and low cost...|$|R
