50|$|Ninety {{percent of}} the world's flat glass is {{produced}} by the float glass process invented in the 1950s by Sir Alastair Pilkington of Pilkington Glass, in which molten glass is poured onto {{one end of a}} molten <b>tin</b> <b>bath.</b> The glass floats on the tin, and levels out as it spreads along the bath, giving a smooth face to both sides. The glass cools and slowly solidifies as it travels over the molten tin and leaves the <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> in a continuous ribbon. The glass is then annealed by cooling in an oven called a lehr. The finished product has near-perfect parallel surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Furnace Room - A large furnace dominates one corner, chains {{dangled from}} above, and a bound female body {{sat in a}} <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> by the furnace, her head {{concealed}} within a tied sack.|$|R
30|$|The {{deposition}} temperature (TS, {{temperature at}} substrate surface) was kept at 520 °C and controlled through the <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> temperature using an electronic temperature controller. The solution flow rate and gas pressure were kept constant at 2.5 mL/min and 8 L/min, respectively; air {{was used as}} the carrier gas supplied by filter equipped oil-free compressor.|$|R

During the experiment, the glass was replaced by a <b>tin</b> <b>bath.</b> 1...|$|R
5000|$|Earlier {{houses are}} small and have front doors opening into the single {{reception}} room. When they were built {{they would have had}} outside toilets. <b>Tin</b> <b>baths</b> were a common feature {{due to the lack of}} bathrooms. Later houses benefited from new legislation and have front doors opening onto a hall with stairs and often a second reception room.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{backyard}} of the café, Ernest brings some sandwiches for the two British airmen. In one of them, they find a note with the message [...] "anal ... ubmarine". They interpret this as Michelle wanting them {{to go down the}} canal to meet the submarine. In their wetsuits the head toward the canal under their <b>tin</b> <b>bath.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tin is {{suitable}} for the float glass process {{because it has a}} high specific gravity, is cohesive, and is immiscible with molten glass. Tin, however, oxidises in a natural atmosphere to form tin dioxide (SnO2). Known in the production process as dross, the tin dioxide adheres to the glass. To prevent oxidation, the <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> is provided with a positive pressure protective atmosphere of nitrogen and hydrogen.|$|R
5000|$|The {{molten glass}} is fed into a [...] "tin bath", a <b>bath</b> of molten <b>tin</b> (about 3-4 m wide, 50 m long, 6 cm deep), from a {{delivery}} canal and is {{poured into the}} <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> by a ceramic lip known as the spout lip. The amount of glass allowed to pour onto the molten tin is controlled by a gate called a tweel.|$|R
60|$|They provide single {{rooms of}} {{moderate}} size, the bed modestly hidden {{during the day}} behind a battered screen. The rooms contain a table, an easy-chair, a hard chair, a bureau, and a round <b>tin</b> <b>bath,</b> which, like the bed, goes into hiding after its useful work is performed. And you may rent one of these rooms, with breakfast thrown in, for five dollars a week.|$|R

60|$|Evidently his sympathies {{now were}} all with Mole, the out-at-elbows, miserable servant of an equally miserable master. His pale-coloured, deep-set eyes {{challenged}} the crowd, which gave way before him, slunk {{back into the}} corners, away from his coldly threatening glance. Thus he found himself suddenly {{face to face with}} Mole, somewhat isolated from the rest, and close to the <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> with its grim contents. Chauvelin had the papers in his hand.|$|R
50|$|Transition {{and heavy}} metal {{fluoroborates}} are {{produced in the}} same manner as other fluoroborate salts; the respective metal salts are added to reacted boric and hydrofluoric <b>acids.</b> <b>Tin,</b> lead, copper, and nickel fluoroborates are prepared through electrolysis of these metals in a solution containing HBF4.|$|R
50|$|His love of {{literature}} and his childhood {{desire to be a}} writer was fed by the books read in Llanelli library.He had to work between the ages of 16 and 36 as a steel foundry ‘moulder' at the Glanmor Foundry. After cycling home and having a <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> he tapped away in the evenings at his typewriter.He was a fluent Welsh speaker. He coped with the physical handicap of a cleft palate and hare lip and overcame a speech impediment all his life.|$|R
2500|$|After melting, {{homogenization}} {{and refining}} (removal of bubbles), {{the glass is}} [...] Flat glass for windows and similar applications is formed by the float glass process, developed between 1953 and 1957 by Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers, who created a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> on which the molten glass flows unhindered {{under the influence of}} gravity. The top surface of the glass is subjected to nitrogen under pressure to obtain a polished finish.|$|R
50|$|Between 1953 and 1957, Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers {{developed}} {{the first successful}} commercial application for forming a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> on which the molten glass flows unhindered {{under the influence of}} gravity. The success of this process lay in the careful balance of the volume of glass fed onto the bath, where it was flattened by its own weight. Full scale profitable sales of float glass were first achieved in 1960.|$|R
50|$|The {{service unit}} also {{contained}} {{a number of}} innovations for occupants. The house retained a coal-fire, but it contained a back boiler to create both central heating {{as well as a}} constant supply of hot water. For a country used to the pleasures of the outside lavatory and <b>tin</b> <b>bath,</b> the bathroom included a flushing toilet and man-sized bath with hot running water. In the kitchen were housed such modern luxuries as a built-in oven, refrigerator and baxi water heater: items we now take for granted.|$|R
30|$|ZnO {{nanorods}} were deposited using pneumatic spray pyrolysis technique. Spray {{aqueous solution}} was prepared by mixing of ZnCl 2 and thiocarbamide (tu) at the molar ratios (Zn:tu) of 1 : 0 (ZnCl 2 solution without tu), 1 : 0.05, 1 : 0.1, 1 : 0.25 and 1 : 0.5. The ZnCl 2 concentration in solutions was adjusted to 0.1 and 0.05 mol/L. The resultant solution in amount of 50 mL was pulverized onto the SnO 2 covered glass and soda-lime bare glass substrates {{mounted on a}} soldered <b>tin</b> <b>bath.</b>|$|R
40|$|TiO 2 {{films were}} {{deposited}} on soda-lime and borosilicate glass substrates, their optical and microstructural properties were investigated. X-ray diffraction showed {{significant differences between}} the sample series. Films deposited on the upper surface of soda-lime glass substrates showed higher indices of refraction than those prepared on the lower surface that had been in contact with the <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> during float glass production. Results indicate that these differences not only result from different optical properties of the TiO 2 backbone material due to alkali contamination but that also different film porosities can measured by ellipsometric porosimetry...|$|R
50|$|The Welsh word 'ponc' means bank or hillock and {{the village}} {{takes its name from}} the large number of spoil tips which {{formerly}} covered the area. Ponciau grew up around opencast mining and houses were built, with little regard for planning, to house the workers. At Brynydd, close to the Royal Oak public house, was the former site of typical very basic, one room, terraced, workers' houses. <b>Tin</b> <b>baths</b> were kept {{to the rear of the}} houses for bathing. Iron was also worked, with large furnaces in use at Furnace Bank.|$|R
50|$|The work {{depicts a}} woman sitting on white towels {{spread over a}} wicker chair, {{with her back to}} the viewer. Her body is arched and {{slightly}} twisted, creating a tension in her back, accentuated by the deep line of her backbone. One hand dries her neck with a towel, presumably after getting out of the <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> in the corner of the room. The other arm leans out to hold onto the chair for support. The space is defined by the vertical and diagonal lines where the floor and walls meet.|$|R
50|$|William Moore {{has given}} a vivid {{description}} of Tasburgh some 50 years ago, of cottages lit by paraffin lamps, <b>tin</b> <b>baths</b> by the fire, water from wells and bucket toilets {{at the bottom of}} the garden. A family of seven occupied a cottage in Saxlingham Lane which had but two rooms downstairs and two up, with an outside wash-house and toilet; it was aptly named Teapot House. An even smaller dwelling stood alongside the Old Post Office, having just one room on each storey to accommodate a family of seven.|$|R
60|$|Camp was {{beginning}} the strenuous life now. Tent after tent emptied itself of its occupants, who stretched themselves vigorously, and proceeded towards the tubbing-ground, {{where there were}} <b>tin</b> <b>baths</b> for those who cared {{to wait until the}} same were vacant, and a good, honest pump for those who did not. Then there was that unpopular job, the piling of one's bedding outside the tent, and the rolling up of the tent curtains. But these unpleasant duties came to an end at last, and signs of breakfast began to appear.|$|R

50|$|In 1939, {{pithead baths}} were {{installed}} at the mine; it meant miners no longer needed to walk home dirty and wet, risking illness. The baths were also beneficial to miners' families; women no longer needed to carry hot jugs of water to fill <b>tin</b> <b>baths</b> and children were no longer accidentally scalded during this process. During the Second World War, surface extraction of coal began at Blaenavon in November 1941 using equipment and skilled men from the Canadian Army. On nationalisation in 1947, the National Coal Board took over the mine from the Blaenavon Co. Ltd, which employed 789 men.|$|R
50|$|Tin(II) sulfide is a brown solid, {{insoluble}} in water, but soluble in concentrated hydrochloric <b>acid.</b> <b>Tin</b> (II) sulfide is soluble in (NH4)2S. It has a layer structure {{similar to}} that of black phosphorus. As per black phosphorus, tin(II) sulfide can be ultrasonically exfoliated in liquids to produce atomically thin semiconducting SnS sheets that have a wider optical band gap (>1.5 eV) compared to the bulk crystal.|$|R
50|$|The glass flows {{onto the}} tin surface forming a {{floating}} ribbon with perfectly smooth surfaces {{on both sides}} and of even thickness. As the glass flows along the <b>tin</b> <b>bath,</b> the temperature is gradually reduced from 1100 °C until at approximately 600 °C the sheet can be lifted from the tin onto rollers. The glass ribbon is pulled off the bath by rollers at a controlled speed. Variation in the flow speed and roller speed enables glass sheets of varying thickness to be formed. Top rollers positioned above the molten tin may be used to control both the thickness and the width of the glass ribbon.|$|R
5000|$|The {{club was}} founded as AWRE Football Club in 1952 by Charles Green, Ted Hall, Gordon Carter, and Don Sharp, and were nicknamed [...] "the Atom Men" [...] after the newly founded Atomic Weapons Research Establishment. As the AWRE complex {{was still under}} {{construction}} when the club was established, the players used empty contractors' huts as changing rooms - carrying the <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> into whichever building was designated for that day's football. The players were also responsible for the pitch, and would mow and mark out the pitch before the match started. The club received support from William Penney during his work at AWRE on the Operation Hurricane project.|$|R
50|$|As Michelle is leaving, Officer Crabtree {{enters the}} café {{and tells the}} café gang of the new rescue plan for the airmen. They are about {{to walk through the}} village canal down to the estuary, where they will be picked up by a British submarine. Edith remarks that the airmen are six feet tall and the canal is eight feet deep, so they are all {{wondering}} how {{they are supposed to be}} able to walk down the canal. Crabtree then shows the airmen in, wearing their escape outfit - consisting of a wetsuit for each and the two of them carrying an upside down <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> tub with an air tube over their heads.|$|R
50|$|Bow Baths on Roman Road {{was opened}} in 1892 to bring {{relief to the}} {{majority}} of local residents who relied on the <b>tin</b> <b>bath,</b> Victoria Park lake or the Canal Water for a bath or a swim. In 1896, the baths were used 176,000 times by a grateful public, and there are reports of queues outside every Saturday in 1921. It offered First or Second Class cold, warm and 'spray' baths, as well as vapour baths. It had a wash house and a swimming pool which had events such as polo tournaments. The heat generated from the baths provided heating and hot water to the Bow Library via pipes under the road.|$|R
5000|$|Produced by George Martin and {{engineered}} by Geoff Emerick, [...] "Yellow Submarine" [...] was finished after five takes on 26 May 1966, in Studio Two at Abbey Road Studios; special effects were added on 1 June. Martin drew on {{his experience as}} a producer of comedy records for Beyond the Fringe and The Goon Show, providing an array of zany sound effects to create the nautical atmosphere. On the second session the studio store cupboard was ransacked for special effects, which included chains, a ship's bell, tap dancing mats, whistles, hooters, waves, a <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> filled with water, wind, and thunderstorm machines, as well as a cash register, which was later used on Pink Floyd's song [...] "Money" [...] (1973). Lennon blew through a straw into a pan of water to create a bubbling effect; McCartney and Lennon talked through tin cans to create the sound of the captain's orders; at 1:38-40 in the song, Starr stepped outside the doors of the recording room and yelled like a sailor, acknowledging [...] "Cut the cable! Drop the cable!", which was looped into the song afterwards; and Abbey Road employees John Skinner and Terry Condon twirled chains in a <b>tin</b> <b>bath</b> to create water sounds. After the line, [...] "and the band begins to play", Emerick found a recording of a brass band and changed it slightly so it could not be identified, although it is thought to be a recording of Georges Krier and Charles Helmer's composition, [...] "Le Rêve Passe" [...] (1906). The original recording had a spoken intro by Starr, but the idea was abandoned on 3 June.|$|R
