5|$|Martin Miller, born Rudolph Muller (2 September 1899 26 August 1969) was a Czech-Austrian {{character}} actor who played many small roles in British films and television series {{from the early}} 1940s until his death. He was best known for playing eccentric doctors, scientists and professors, although he played {{a wide range of}} small, obscure rolesincluding photographers, waiters, a pet store dealer, rabbis, a Dutch sailor and a Swiss tailor.

40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the existence}} of <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity among information technology (IT) personnel in the army services in Malaysia. This study also attempts {{to determine whether there}} is any difference between <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity based on demographic factors such as age, gender, management group and duration of service in the army. Variables such as task satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>role</b> overload were also examined to determine their correlation with <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity. A total of 83 IT personnel including army officers and other ranks from selected army organisations within Kuala Lumpur were sampled. This study, which was conducted in 2005 employed survey method with questionnaires as instrument to collect the data. The data analysis supports the hypothesis regarding {{the existence of}} <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> <b>role</b> overload among IT personnel in the army service. However, the overall level of <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> <b>role</b> overload is low. There is significant difference of role conflict between age and gender. IT personnel do not experience role ambiguity, instead they show high role clarity regarding work objectives, scope of work, responsibilities <b>and</b> <b>role</b> undertakings. The findings also show the correlation between <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> <b>role</b> overload but no significant correlation can be seen between <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> job satisfaction. This research is intended to inform the Malaysian Army policy makers about the importance of a conducive working environment. Top management must be aware of the continuous stress experienced by IT personnel and seek to overcome the problem...|$|R
40|$|Changes {{that are}} {{introduced}} in an organizational restructuring {{will affect the}} communication, decision-making, <b>role</b> clarification <b>and</b> the well-being of organization members, given the potential for uncertainty that may accompany such changes. There {{is a need to}} better understand the consequences of organizational restructuring and consider some of its potential side effects on the work environment. Employees in a restructuring context are understandably wary about the future direction ofthe organization <b>and</b> their <b>roles</b> within it.

5|$|After the Norman invasion, the {{position}} of women in society changed. The rights <b>and</b> <b>roles</b> of women became more sharply defined, in part {{as a result of}} the development of the feudal system and the expansion of the English legal system; some women benefited from this, while others lost out. The rights of widows were formally laid down in law by the end of the 12th century, clarifying the right of free women to own property, but this did not necessarily prevent women from being forcibly remarried against their wishes. The growth of governmental institutions under a succession of bishops reduced the role of queens and their households in formal government. Married or widowed noblewomen remained significant cultural and religious patrons and played an important part in political and military events, even if chroniclers were uncertain if this was appropriate behaviour. As in earlier centuries, most women worked in agriculture, but here roles became more clearly gendered, with ploughing and managing the fields defined as men's work, for example, and dairy production becoming dominated by women.|$|E
5|$|Ecology and {{evolutionary}} biology are considered sister disciplines {{of the life}} sciences. Natural selection, life history, development, adaptation, populations, and inheritance are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological {{and evolutionary}} theory. Morphological, behavioural, and genetic traits, for example, can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study {{the historical development of}} a species in relation to their functions <b>and</b> <b>roles</b> in different ecological circumstances. In this framework, the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize, classify, and investigate life through common systematic principals, such as phylogenetics or the Linnaean system of taxonomy. The two disciplines often appear together, such as in the title of the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution. There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution, and they differ more in their areas of applied focus. Both disciplines discover and explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different spatial or temporal scales of organization. While the boundary between ecology and evolution is not always clear, ecologists study the abiotic and biotic factors that influence evolutionary processes, and evolution can be rapid, occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the visuals and audio, the overall gameplay system remained mostly unchanged from that used since Final Fantasy V, using research done to promote player control. The initial decision was for battles to feature shifting camera angles. Battle arenas had a lower polygon count than field areas, which made picking out distinctive features for each one more difficult. The summon sequences benefited strongly from the switch to the cinematic style, as the team had struggled to portray their scale using 2D graphics. In his role as producer, Sakaguchi placed much of his effort into developing the battle system, also proposing the Materia system. Materia provided more character customization than previous Final Fantasy games: battles no longer revolved around characters with innate skills <b>and</b> <b>roles</b> in battle, as Materia could be reconfigured between battles. Nomura {{also contributed to the}} gameplay, creating the Limit Break system as an evolution of the Desperation Attacks used in Final Fantasy VI. The Limit Breaks served a purpose in gameplay while also bringing out each character's personality in battle.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the multidimensional and mediating relationships between six {{total quality management}} (TQM) practices, <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity. Survey data are collected from 422 employees from ISO-certified firms in Malaysia. With the use of structural equation modelling, the findings indicate that higher levels of process management and information analysis lead to lower levels of role conflict. The presence of a quality-oriented human resource focus induces higher levels of role conflict. Strategic planning is negatively related to role ambiguity. Customer focus <b>and</b> <b>role</b> conflict {{are found to be}} independently and positively related to role ambiguity. Role conflict is found to be a full mediator between the following: human resource focus <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity; process management <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity; information analysis <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity. The research model serves as a diagnostic tool for the organisational administrators to manage the individual employee stress behaviour by leveraging current TQM practices, and fine-tune the right characteristics to reduce undesirable <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity. The study and its findings have filled a research gap in the literature of TQM and psychological well-being of employees.

40|$|The bureaucratic reform at {{the local}} {{government}} level in Indonesia that was instituted in 2012 has turned local government internal auditors into {{an important part of}} government governance systems. The role of local government internal auditors has been expanded to include not only the area of audit oversight, but also the areas of anti-corruption-related and consulting activities. These fundamental changes may potentially induce <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity among internal auditors. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine empirically the determinants <b>and</b> consequences of <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity among local government internal auditors. More specifically, this study attempts to examine the extent to which formalization determines <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity; it further tests the impact of <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity on commitment to independence and job performance. Questionnaires were distributed to 248 local government internal auditors from 12 Regional Inspectorates in the provinces of Yogyakarta, South Sumatra, and East Java. A total of 176 responses were received, and 124 useable responses from the 176 responses were analysed to test the hypotheses. Using Structural Equation Modelling-Partial Least Square the results show that: formalization is negatively related to <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity; role ambiguity has a negative impact on commitment to independence; role conflict has a positive impact on job performance; <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity has a negative impact on job performance. These findings serve as important external validity evidence on the phenomena associated with <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity that occur in the public sector, especially among internal auditors at local government institutions...|$|R

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the sinking, Royal Oaks survivors were billeted in the towns and villages of Orkney. A funeral parade for the dead took place at Lyness on Hoy on 16 October; many of the surviving crew, having lost all their own clothing on the ship, attended in borrowed boiler suits and gym shoes. They were generally granted a few days survivors' leave by the navy, and then assigned to ships <b>and</b> <b>roles</b> elsewhere. Kenneth Toop, who survived the sinking while serving as a Boy, First Class on Royal Oak, served as the Royal Oak Association's Honorary Secretary. An annual ceremony of remembrance is held by the survivors and descendants of the crew at the Naval War Memorial, Southsea, on the anniversary of the sinking. The last remaining survivor of Royal Oak, Arthur Smith, who had been a 17-year old Boy, First Class when the ship was struck, died on 11 December 2016. He had been on watch at the bridge and had jumped from the sinking ship, swimming in the wrong direction until he was picked up by a boat and transferred to the Daisy 2.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the influence of organisational socialisation towards <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity, achievement motivation and life satisfaction among newcomers. This research is a cross-sectional study using quantitative method through distribution of questionnaires. A total of 258 respondents were chosen using purposive sampling technique among Diplomatic and Administration Officers (PTD) in Malaysia with less than 5 years of services. Four instruments were used in order to collect the data. The instruments are demographical information to assess the homogenous characteristic of respondents, Organisational Socialisation Scale to measure organisation socialisation, <b>Role</b> Conflict <b>and</b> <b>Role</b> Ambiguity Scale to measure <b>role</b> conflict <b>and</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity, Cassidy <b>and</b> Lynn Achievement Motivation to measure worker intrinsic motivation and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) were used to measure general life satisfaction among respondents.
