5000|$|Unlike in the US, shag-tobacco, {{including}} Drum {{does not}} include rolling papers. An exception to this is Ireland: {{when you buy a}} pouch (12.5 or 25 gram) it comes without papers, but when you buy a box containing a paper wrapper with 12.5 gram tobacco it comes with papers; while box including papers is cheaper than the pouch without. But the type of tobacco in the pouch is different: the cut is rougher and is not as dry as the [...] "wrapper". You get Job papers in the United States <b>in</b> <b>25g</b> pouches.|$|R

40|$|The {{volume of}} sweat {{produced}} by axon reflex stimulation using acetylcholine {{was measured in}} one foot each of 35 control subjects and 52 feet of 37 diabetic patients (28 with neuropathic ulceration, 11 with Charcot arthropathy, nine with somatic neuropathy but no foot lesion and four with no evidence of somatic neuropathy). In controls, the volume of sweat was greater in males than females. A flare response was seen in 94 % of control feet. In diabetics, the volume of sweat was within the control range in 17 feet, increased in one, reduced <b>in</b> seven, and <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> 27. Sweating was <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> 75 % of feet with a neuropathic ulcer; a flare response was <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> 86 % of them. Sweating was only <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> 36 % of feet with Charcot arthropathy and was increased in one, whereas the flare response was <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> all. Autonomic cardiovascular reflexes were more frequently abnormal than the sweat test; sweating was <b>absent</b> <b>in</b> only one patient with normal cardiovascular reflexes...|$|R
