Gudule in Brussels in 1469-1470, as an adult (tenor) singer; this is considered very likely to have been him. [...] In 1471 he was in Ghent at the Jacobskerk as a part-time singer, paid from the cathedral's miscellaneous fund, suggesting he was brought in for special performances of polyphony. Subsequently he was employed in Nieuwpoort in 1472, at the church of Onze-Lieve-Vrouw, probably initially as a temporary arrangement, {{but by the end of}} the year the church authorities hired him on a more permanent basis. He was no longer employed there by 1477/8 for his name had vanished from the <b>account-book.</b>|$|E

60|$|He didn't say it. But Father {{had been}} knocked breathless by an idea. He was silent {{all the way}} home. He made figures on the last leaf of his little pocket <b>account-book.</b> He manoeuvered to get Mother alone, and exultantly shot his idea at her.|$|E

60|$|Dora told me, shortly afterwards, {{that she}} was going to be a {{wonderful}} housekeeper. Accordingly, she polished the tablets, pointed the pencil, bought an immense <b>account-book,</b> carefully stitched up with a needle and thread all the leaves of the Cookery Book which Jip had torn, and made quite a desperate little attempt 'to be good', as she called it. But the figures had the old obstinate propensity--they WOULD NOT add up. When she had entered two or three laborious items in the <b>account-book,</b> Jip would walk over the page, wagging his tail, and smear them all out. Her own little right-hand middle finger got steeped to the very bone in ink; and I think that was the only decided result obtained.|$|E

Her private <b>account-book</b> had not been wanted lately--it was locked up in her dressing-case. She took it out, and {{referred}} to it. There was the entry as she had copied it, and compared it with the ledger--"20,000 florins." ...|$|E
60|$|His clerk {{sat beside}} him, with <b>account-books</b> and {{parchment}} spread upon the table, {{and the head}} squire, Walter Blunt, a lad some {{three or four years}} older than Myles, and half a head taller, black-browed, powerfully built, and with cheek and chin darkened by the soft budding of his adolescent beard, stood making his report.|$|R
6000|$|However, after detaining Mr. Graham five or {{six days}} in custody on the island, which is still called Rob Roy's Prison, and could be no {{comfortable}} dwelling for November nights, the Outlaw seems to have despaired of attaining further advantage from his bold attempt, and suffered his prisoner to depart uninjured, with the <b>account-books,</b> and bills granted by the tenants, taking especial care to retain the cash.* ...|$|R
60|$|According to the Metz chronicle, {{these two}} {{brothers}} of the Maid, on May 20, 1436, recognised the impostor for their sister, and the <b>account-books</b> of Orleans leave {{no doubt that}} Jehan, at least, actually did accept her as such, in August 1436, four months after they met in May. Now this lasting recognition by one, at least, of the brothers, is a fact very hard to explain.|$|R

6000|$|Kennicott {{made much}} of {{erecting}} it entirely for her and the baby. He spoke of closets for her frocks, and [...] "a comfy sewing-room." [...] But when he drew on a leaf from an old <b>account-book</b> (he was a paper-saver and a string-picker) {{the plans for the}} garage, he gave much more attention to a cement floor and a work-bench and a gasoline-tank than he had to sewing-rooms.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I know no harm of you," [...] said Niccolo, in his blunt way again. [...] "But {{have you}} {{the money to pay}} for the coat? For you've passed my shop often enough to know my sign: you've seen the burning <b>account-books.</b> I trust nobody. The price is twenty florins, and that's because it's second-hand. You're not likely to have so much money with you. Let it be till to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{mirror in}} its silver frame {{was like a}} stage, brilliantly lit, in which a drama was in progress. There was no mist now. The oppression of my nerves had wrought this amazing clarity. Every feature, every movement, was as {{clear-cut}} as in life. To think that I, a tired accountant, the most prosaic of mankind, with the <b>account-books</b> of a swindling bankrupt before me, should be chosen of all the human race to look upon such a scene! ...|$|R

She was going for twelve hundred pounds: the Post Office didn't look for more. We got her for eleven hundred, with the guns, and the repairs may have cost a hundred and fifty; but you'll find the <b>account-books</b> in the cupboard there. Father had a matter of five hundred laid by, and a little over." ...|$|R
