5|$|HMS Revenge was one {{of seven}} Royal Sovereign-class pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy during the 1890s. She {{spent much of her}} early career as a {{flagship}} for the Flying Squadron <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mediterranean,</b> Home and Channel Fleets. Revenge was assigned to the International Squadron blockading Crete during the revolt there against the Ottoman Empire. She was placed in reserve upon her return home in 1900, and was then briefly assigned as a coast guard ship before she joined the Home Fleet in 1902. The ship became a gunnery training ship in 1906 until she was paid off in 1913.|$|E
5|$|In {{the other}} naval theatres {{there were no}} decisive pitched battles. In the Black Sea, {{engagement}} between Russian and Turkish battleships was restricted to skirmishes. In the Baltic Sea, action was largely limited to the raiding of convoys, and the laying of defensive minefields; the only significant clash of battleship squadrons there was the Battle of Moon Sound at which one Russian pre-dreadnought was lost. The Adriatic was {{in a sense the}} mirror of the North Sea: the Austro-Hungarian dreadnought fleet remained bottled up by the British and French blockade. <b>And</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mediterranean,</b> the most important use of battleships was in support of the amphibious assault on Gallipoli.|$|E

5|$|Patchy {{records from}} around the world {{indicate}} the bignose shark probably has a circumglobal distribution in tropical and subtropical waters. In the Atlantic Ocean, it occurs from Delaware Bay to Brazil, in the Mediterranean Sea, and off West Africa. In the Indian Ocean, it is known in South Africa and Madagascar, the Red Sea, India, and the Maldives. In the Pacific Ocean, it has been recorded from China to Australia, around Hawaii, and from the Gulf of California to Ecuador. It is reportedly common off Florida, the Bahamas, and the West Indies, and rare off Brazil <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mediterranean.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sources {{from the}} 19th and early 20th centuries {{indicate}} that the angelshark was once abundant all around the coasts of Western Europe. Yarrell (1836), Day (1880–04), and Garstang (1903) all noted that the angelshark was common around the British Isles, and Rey (1928) recorded that this species was common around the Iberian Peninsula <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mediterranean.</b> However, from {{the latter half of}} the 20th century onwards, the angelshark has come under intense pressure from commercial fisheries operating across much of its range. Due to its benthic, near-shore habits, individuals of all ages are susceptible to incidental capture by bottom trawls, trammel nets, and bottom longlines; the low reproductive rate of this shark limits its capacity to withstand population depletion.|$|E
5|$|The {{bramble shark}} {{is not known}} to pose a danger to humans. It is caught {{incidentally}} by commercial fisheries in bottom trawls and on fishing line, {{as well as by}} sport anglers. In the eastern Atlantic, this species is processed into fishmeal but has little commercial significance. Its liver oil is highly valued in South Africa as medicine, whereas in India the oil is considered poor and is used to coat canoes to discourage woodboring beetles. Historical accounts suggest that bramble shark numbers in the northeastern Atlantic have fallen markedly since the 18th and 19th centuries, such as that it is now extremely rare off northern Europe <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mediterranean.</b> This decline has been attributed to fishing pressure, to which this species may be highly vulnerable as large, deep-sea sharks generally have slow growth rates and long lifespans. Regarding the species as a whole, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks sufficient data for an assessment beyond Data Deficient.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} of HMS Dreadnought in 1906 rendered the class, {{and all other}} pre-dreadnought battleships, obsolete {{only a few years}} after the last-of-class entered service in 1902.

The four surviving ships were reduced to subsidiary duties late in World War I and were scrapped in the early 1920s.|$|E
