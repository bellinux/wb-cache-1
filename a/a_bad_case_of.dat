5|$|In 1981, Yamaha {{introduced}} a new square-four cylinder bike, similar to Suzuki's RG500. Roberts raced to a second-place finish behind Marco Luchinelli at the non-championship Imola 200 race. Roberts' bike had a suspension failure in the Grand Prix season opener at Austria, but he rebounded to win the next two races in Germany and Italy. Roberts' title hopes suffered a setback at the Dutch TT at Assen when his Yamaha's front brake pads were installed incorrectly causing his front wheel to lock up on the starting line, ending his race before it had started. He came back to score a second place behind Lucchinelli in Belgium, but was once again struck by misfortune when <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> food poisoning forced him to miss the San Marino Grand Prix. He then narrowly lost the British Grand Prix to Jack Middelburg by three-tenths of a second before ending his season with a seventh place in Finland and a retirement in Sweden. Suzuki team riders Mamola and Lucchinelli battled to the final race of the season before the Italian claimed the championship {{with a total of}} five Grand Prix victories, with Mamola finishing in second and Roberts in third place.|$|E

40|$|Well, it’s official. Recently, President Carter took breath {{from his}} other crises and {{announced}} that the United States had entered a period of recession. “The Wolf Has Arrived”, Time headlined, but reassured us that it was “better late than never”. This curious judgment {{is based on the}} belief that the recession, like a crisis in a long, wasting disease, is a Good Thing. It should have come a year ago, Time argues, but was delayed by <b>a</b> “ <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> inflationary psychology”. For months, consumers (Yes! It’s their fault again!) have been rushing out to buy in the belief that prices, no matter how high already, could only go higher. “This has ballooned inflation to an annual rate of more than 18 per cent”, Time regrets.

40|$|Faulty device {{drivers are}} {{a major source of}} {{operating}} system failures. We argue that the underlying cause of many driver faults is the separation of two highly-related tasks: device verification and driver development. These two tasks have a lot in common, and result in software that is conceptually and functionally similar, yet kept totally separate. The result is <b>a</b> particularly <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> duplication of effort: the verification code is correct, but is discarded after the device has been manufactured; the driver code is inferior, but used in actual device operation. We claim that the two tasks, and the software they produce, can and should be unified, and this will result in drastic improvement of device-driver quality and reduction in the development cost and time to market. In this paper we discuss technical issues involved in achieving such unification and present our solutions to these issues. We report the results <b>of</b> a <b>case</b> study that applies this approach to implement a driver for an Ethernet controller device. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Meckel’s {{diverticulum}} is {{the most}} common congenital abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract. The perforation of a Meckel’s diverticulum by a foreign body is a very rare complication. Case presentation: A 61 -year-old male presented to the Emergency Department with complaints with abdominal pain and fever, and abdominal rebound tenderness on physical examination. An intestinal perforation by a foreign body was diagnosed by CT scan. The patient was submitted to a diagnostic laparoscopy and a perforation of a Meckel’s diverticulum by a foreign body was identified. The foreign body was removed and a stapled diverticulectomy was performed. Discussion: Meckel’s diverticulum is asymptomatic in most of the affected individuals, with a 4. 2 – 16. 9 % probability of symptomatic presentations. The clinical presentation ranges from intestinal obstruction, to bleeding, inflammation and perforation. While children with Meckel’s diverticulum present more often with gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal obstruction {{is the most}} common presentation in adults. Foreign body perforation of a Meckel’s diverticulum is an extremely rare event. There is general agreement that a symptomatic Meckel’s diverticulum should be resected. Laparoscopy is a safe diagnostic and therapeutic tool that can decrease diagnostic time and theoretically avoids the morbidity and mortality of a delayed diagnosis. Conclusion: The perforation of a Meckel diverticulum by a foreign body is an extremely rare event and may have <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> prognosis in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> delayed diagnosis...|$|R
