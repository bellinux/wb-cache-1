5|$|Its {{mixture of}} genres makes The General in His Labyrinth {{difficult}} to classify, and commentators disagree over where it {{lies on the}} scale between novel and historical account. García Márquez's insertion of interpretive and fictionalized elements—some dealing with Bolívar's most intimate moments—caused outrage in parts of Latin America when the book was released. Many prominent Latin American figures believed that the novel damaged the reputation {{of one of the}} region's most important historic figures and portrayed a negative image to the outside world. Others saw The General in His Labyrinth as a tonic for Latin <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> a challenge to the region to deal with its problems.|$|E

5|$|The 1960s saw several {{important}} changes in popular music, especially rock. Many {{of these changes}} took place through the British Invasion where bands such as The Beatles, The Who, The Rolling Stones, became immensely popular and {{had a profound effect}} on <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> music.These changes included the move from professionally composed songs to the singer-songwriter, and the understanding of popular music as an art, rather than a form of commerce or pure entertainment. These changes led to the rise of musical movements connected to political goals, such as the American Civil Rights Movement and the opposition to the Vietnam War. Rock was at the forefront of this change.|$|E

25|$|Strongheart's mother, Chi-Nach-Lut Schu-Wah-Elks, was {{a member}} of the Yakama Nation. He was exposed to native culture through {{performing}} with his father in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show and its successors; according to some sources Strongheart spent most of his childhood with his white father away from the reservation and Indian culture; other sources say he was adopted by a Yakima woman, and brought up and educated on the reservation. Strongheart's public performances began in 1917 when he worked for the YMCA War Work Council. He toured military camps across New England, where he gave presentations on Native <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> spoke seriously about military service. His talks encouraged hundreds of men to volunteer for war service. After World War I and his job ended, Strongheart moved briefly to the Yakama Indian Reservation but left again and had a successful career in the Lyceum and Chautauqua circuits of fairs, where he gave presentations on Native <b>American</b> <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> often spoke against the reservation lifestyle enforced by government policy. He played an important role in the development of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 signed by President Calvin Coolidge, which he thought would help end reservations and empower Indian culture.|$|E
