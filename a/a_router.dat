5|$|During this period, Thordendal, who {{was working}} as a carpenter, severed the tip of his left middle finger, while Haake injured his hand in <b>a</b> <b>router</b> accident. As a result, the band was unable to perform for several months. Thordendal's {{fingertip}} was later reattached, and he went on to make a full recovery. The Selfcaged EP was recorded in April and May 1994, but its release was delayed to later in 1995 due to the accidents.|$|E

Using commodity x 86 hardware we show that it is viable to run highly experimental and un-trusted router systems along side <b>a</b> production <b>router</b> on the same hardware platform whilst remaining performant.

There are approximately 383 AM and 659 FM radio stations and 297 television and 873 cable television stations. On March 29, 1994, the country went live on the Internet via a 64 kbit/s connection from <b>a</b> <b>router</b> serviced by PLDT to a Sprint router in California. Estimates for Internet penetration in the Philippines vary widely ranging {{from a low of}} 2.5million to a high of 24million people.

25|$|A {{computer}} called <b>a</b> <b>router</b> {{is provided}} with an interface to each network. It forwards network packets {{back and forth between}} them. Originally <b>a</b> <b>router</b> was called gateway, but the term was changed to avoid confusion with other types of gateways.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>router</b> may {{be mounted}} {{upside down in}} <b>a</b> <b>router</b> table or bench. The router's base plate is mounted to the {{underside}} of the table, with a hole allowing the bit to protrude above the table top. This allows the work to be passed over the router, rather than passing the router over the work. This has benefits when working with smaller objects and makes some router operations safer to execute. <b>A</b> <b>router</b> table may be fitted with a fence, fingerboards and other work-guiding accessories to make the operation safer and more accurate.|$|E
50|$|In Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), <b>a</b> P <b>Router</b> or Provider <b>Router</b> is <b>a</b> Label Switch <b>Router</b> (LSR) that {{functions}} as <b>a</b> transit <b>router</b> {{of the core}} network. The P Router is typically connected {{to one or more}} PE Routers.|$|R

5000|$|An egress <b>router</b> is <b>a</b> Label Switch <b>Router</b> that is <b>an</b> {{end point}} (drain) {{for a given}} Label Switched Path (LSP). An egress <b>router</b> may be <b>an</b> ingress <b>router</b> or <b>an</b> {{intermediate}} <b>router</b> for any other LSP(s). Hence the role of egress and ingress routers is LSP specific. Usually, the MPLS label is attached with an IP packet at the ingress router and removed at the egress router, whereas label swapping is performed on the intermediate routers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> WAN edge <b>router</b> is <b>a</b> {{device that}} routes data packets between {{different}} locations of a WAN, giving an enterprise {{access to a}} carrier network. Also called <b>a</b> boundary <b>router,</b> it is contrasted with <b>a</b> core <b>router</b> which only sends packets within a single network. [...] SD-WANs can work as an overlay to simplify the management of existing WAN edge routers, by lowering dependence on routing protocols. [...] SD-WAN can also potentially be an alternative to WAN Edge routers.|$|R
25|$|Hello: Hello {{messages}} {{are used as}} a form of greeting, to allow <b>a</b> <b>router</b> to discover other adjacent routers on its local links and networks. The messages establish relationships between neighboring devices (called adjacencies) and communicate key parameters about how OSPF is {{to be used in the}} autonomous system or area. During normal operation, routers send hello messages to their neighbors at regular intervals (the hello interval); if <b>a</b> <b>router</b> stops receiving hello messages from a neighbor, after a set period (the dead interval) the router will assume the neighbor has gone down.|$|E
