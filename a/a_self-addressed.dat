No increase in the levels of disease reporting was observed, based on 4 years' experience with the revised CMR card and the Public Health Letter.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide empirical evidence of the role of information professionals in knowledge management programs. 386 information professionals working in Canadian organizations were selected from the Special Libraries Association's Who's Who in Special Libraries 2001 / 2002 and questionnaire with <b>a</b> stamped <b>self-addressed</b> envelope for its return was sent to each one of them. 63 questionnaires were completed and returned, and 8 in-depth interviews conducted.

Factors such as gender, age, and educational background (i. e. highest educational qualifications and discipline) did not seem to have any relationship with involvement in knowledge management programs. Many of those involved in the programs are playing key roles, such as the design of the information architecture, development of taxonomy, or content management of the organization's intranet.

The 132 living members of the senior classes of 1946 and 1947 served as the population of study. The cohort approach was used to control such variables as age, high school education, rural area of origin and socio- cultural background.

50|$|Blanks and Postage (often {{abbreviated}} B&P) is {{a method}} of acquiring recordings, typically live music, by mailing blank CD-Rs or DVD-Rs and <b>a</b> <b>self-addressed</b> stamped envelope to an experienced trader.

The present study revealed that, 24 &#x 0025; of ICUs had a resident physiotherapist available during the night and 79 &#x 0025; of physiotherapists available on-call.
