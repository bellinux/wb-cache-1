40|$|Current {{methods of}} {{measuring}} {{soil water potential}} are reviewed, and the limitations of each are noted. The need for a transducer that will measure soil water potential over a wide moisture range {{for long periods of}} time is delineated. The concept of utilizing an <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface</b> that resembles the soil in its water holding capacity as a transducer is discussed. Various designs and materials are tested for such a transducer. All designs tested did not fulfill the requirements needed for a truly useful transducer. However, experimental results show that modification of the <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface</b> should allow construction of a unit that will be useful in soil water research...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This work explores an {{estimation}} of <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface</b> coverage for carbon tetrachloride onto different carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Two kinds of CNFs with various pore characteristics are fabricated by template-based and thermal {{chemical vapor deposition}} methods, respectively. The pore size distributions of these carbons, determined according to the density functional theory model, are found to vary with synthesis methods. The results of adsorption experiments show that CCl 4 adsorption isotherms of these CNFs are of Langmuir-type model during the restricted pressure of 0 – 0. 2 atm at 30 °C. The surface coverage capable of adsorbing CCl 4 molecules onto the CNFs can be determined based on the monolayer adsorption model. Interestingly, the CCl 4 capacity of these CNFs does not proportionally increase with their specific surface area, and the CNFs with more micropore fraction facilitate the <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface</b> coverage. This finding attributes to a fact that micropores in the CNFs have stronger adsorption energies, thus, become a major provider for carbon tetrachloride adsorption...|$|E
40|$|Serum {{components}} inhibit DNA polymerase, thereby obviating direct {{detection of}} serum viral DNA sequences by the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR). This has necessitated extraction of nucleic acid from sera before performing PCR and has resulted in loss of sensitivity. By adsorbing virus to a solid surface (microcentrifuge tubes or antibody coated microparticles) followed by proteinase K digestion, as little as three viruses per 200 microliters serum may be directly detected by PCR without nucleic acid extraction. The sensitivity {{is dependent on the}} surface area of the <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface</b> and is increased by having antibodies on the <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface.</b> The nucleic acid sequence of the amplified DNA fragments may be directly determined by the dideoxy method. Of 24 plasma samples from HBsAg+ volunteer blood donors, HBV DNA was detected in 7 by dot blot assay, 7 by liquid hybridization, and 9 by PCR. PCR detected DNA in every sample that was positive by another assay. Analysis of serial samples of two patients with acute self-limited hepatitis B found detectable HBsAg and pre-S 2 antigenemia before HBV DNA by the PCR method. These results suggest that surface antigenemia may precede viremia during acute hepatitis...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of dicquat dibromide as {{affected by}} available soil moisture and concentration of diquat was studied on Blount silt loam soil in east central Indiana. The diquat under varying concentrations and soil moisture conditions was topically applied to twenty-seven, 1 / 2 meter square sample plots with the surface vegetation removed to expose bare soil. The soil {{texture of the}} research site was determined using the Bouyoucos hydrometer method. From the texture analysis, the highly adsorptive montmorillonite clay {{was determined to be}} the major <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surfaces</b> available to the diquat radical. With the montmorillonite clays being the major <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surfaces,</b> it was concluded that the applied diquat was completely adsorbed by the soil colloids. Using a modified Langlois-Stemp-Liska procedure for pesticide extraction and clean-up, the major effect of the herbicide concentrations and the soil moisture conditions on the adsorptive capacity of the soil colloids for the diquat radical was determined to be at the level of degrees of adsorption.

40|$|Development of a {{biosensor}} for {{the simultaneous}} detection of microorganisms and toxins This project {{aimed at the}} development of a novel test system (parallel affinity sensor array, PASA) enabling the rapid, parallel and automated detection of microorganisms and toxins (Y. pestis, F. tularensis, C. burnetii, shigatoxins 1 und 2, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B und orthopoxvirus). For this purpose the classical sandwich-EIA principle was combined with the innovative microarray technology. The core of the biosensor is a planar biochip represented by a modified microscope slide on which the different tests run in parallel. The detection is enabled by specific antibodies attached to the slides surface by covalent or adsorptive binding. All further incubation steps are performed in a flow-through cell, reagents are automatically supplied by computer controlled pumps. With respect to the implementation of the detection methods in the PASA system each single-analyte assay was optimized by using classical EIA techniques and then adapted to a uniform test procedure. To enhance assay sensitivity the Biotin/ExtrAvidin, the Digoxigenin/anti-digoxigenin and partially fluorescence detection methods were checked. The most sensitive assays could be established by using detection antibodies labelled with digoxigenin. The detection limits of the optimized assays were in the range of 103 - 104 cfu/ml, microbial toxins could be detected at the pg-level. For transferring these optimized assays from microtiter plates to the biosensor platform a broad range of different biochip surfaces were tested. With some of the tested materials major problems encountered either due to inactivation of the antibodies during the immobilization on covalently binding solid phases or due to bleaching-out of antibody-coated <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The use of antibodies labelled with fluorochromes proved to be a failure. Two chemiluminescent microarray tests which complied with the basic requirements adherent to the establishment of an automated rapid detection method were further optimized and evaluated for robustness. Both assays enabled the reliable and reproducible detection of bacteria (105 – 107 cfu/ml) and purified toxins (lower ng-range) within 25 min. Thus, these microarrays rank among the most sensitive rapid tests described so far...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of two organic amendments on norflurazon sorption-desorption processes in four soils {{with very different}} physicochemical characteristics was studied in laboratory experiments to evaluate the potential leaching of this pesticide through organic fertilized soils. Sorption-desorption experiments were performed on original soils and on a mixture of these soils with urban waste compost (SUW) and a commercial amendment from olive-mill wastes (OW), {{at a rate of}} 6. 25 % (w/w). These mixtures were used immediately after preparation and after aging for 2 months. Norflurazon was analyzed by using a HPLC method. Norflurazon retention in original soils was related not only to the organic matter (OM) content but also to mineral surfaces present in soils. Norflurazon sorption increases largely after amendment in soils with low OM content, but the addition of exogenous OM to soils with medium OM content and/or other available <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surfaces</b> did not significantly affect norflurazon sorption. Even in some cases pesticide sorption decreases, due to the blocking of the mineral and organic soil surfaces with the amendment added. Transformation of exogenous OM during incubation depends both on the amendment added and on the type of soil and can affect sorption-desorption behavior of the soils surfaces in different manner, due to the modification of their hydrophobic-hydrophilic characteristics. Norflurazon desorption from original soils showed hysteresis in all cases, but it was not affected or even decreased in amended soils. It was a nonexpected behavior, especially in sandy soil, since it is generally assumed that a higher sorption always implies a lower mobility in soils. Norflurazon sorption must be taking place on very low affinity sites on exogenous OM through weak bindings, from which the pesticide can be easily desorbed. The application to soils of the organic amendments {{used in the present study}} could not be accepted to reduce norflurazon losses due to leaching processes.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{to characterize the}} surface heterogeneity of polar adsorptive material under NP mode is proposed. The method relies in the determination of a few nonlinear perturbation peaks of strong MP modifiers, recorded after equilibration of the <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface</b> with a weak component (hexane, heptane, dichloromethane). This approach has been proven {{to be able to}} investigate phenomena that take place at rare sites present on stationary phases, i. e. the isotherm region that firstly saturates. It has been demonstrated that, on an immobilized cellulose-based CSP, adsorption of 2 -propanol is best modelled by a single Langmuir isotherm, while for EtOAc a BiLangmuir isotherm is necessary.

30|$|As summarized, {{there is}} {{actually}} no established intelligent tool to shorten the experimental duration of Fe 0 testing while still obtaining reliable results. On the contrary, available discrepancies in the literature have been widely explained after purposefully lengthening the duration of batch experiments from some hours to some weeks (up to 16  weeks or 120  days) while working under quiescent conditions (Noubactep et al. 2003, 2005 a, 2006, 2009 a). Moreover, inert (e.g., sand) and/or reactive additives (e.g., FeS 2, MnO 2) have been demonstrated to sustain {{the efficiency of the}} Fe 0 /H 20 system primarily by avoiding material compaction and increasing the <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface</b> by in situ coating of the surface of the additives (Noubactep et al. 2005 a; Ghauch et al. 2010, 2011; Noubactep 2013 d; Gheju et al. 2016).|$|E
30|$|The {{particulate}} residues left by fire {{are also}} an important pathway for nutrients to return back to or redistribute in the ecosystem after the fire (Zackrisson et al. 1996, Qian et al. 2009). Fire residues contain small amounts of inorganic and organic N that directly serve as a N source (Qian et al. 2009, Hogue and Inglett 2012). Both ash and charcoal can also exert an indirect influence on N availability through modification of the pH and the cation exchange capacity (Raison 1979, Glaser et al. 2002). Indirectly, P in fire residues can also stimulate N processes, such as N 2 fixation and nitrification, and N mineralization, especially in P-limited ecosystems (Eisele et al. 1990; White and Reddy 1999, 2000). Charcoal with its great <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface</b> can also enhance nitrification, leading to elevated nitrate levels (Zackrisson et al. 1996; Wardle et al. 1998; DeLuca et al. 2002, 2006).|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Water {{reclamation}} is {{a strategy}} of moving toward sustainable management of freshwater and environmental protection. Treated wastewater has been widely recognized as a potential source of water for landscape and agricultural irrigation, industrial cooling, surface replenishment, groundwater recharge, portable and non-portable use for the past decades. However, concerns about pathogenic organisms and trace organic contaminants in reclaimed water remaine. Low-cost treatment methods show promise in reducing these contaminants in wastewater, but more investigation of these technologies is still needed to improve the efficiency for renewable and sustainable water reclamation. This study presents the soil based filter as a treatment means to remove bacteria in agricultural and domestic effluents for water reclamation. An improved soil filter by ferric oxide based materials integrated with native soil protozoa bacterivory was efficient to eliminate E. coli in swine wastewater. Under anaerobic environment, the microbial iron reduction (MIR) process was very efficient in inactivating E. coli cells. The ferrous production in MIR process {{was identified as a}} mechanism for E. coli inactivation under the anaerobic condition. Inactivated bacterial cells were used by the MIR community as an electron donor to drive the MIR process. The anaerobic-aerobic two-stage slow sand filter was a robust system for water reclamation. High removal efficiencies of carbon substrates, trace organic compounds, and microbial contaminants were obtained in this study. The iron oxide coated sand and MIR biofilm provided <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surfaces</b> to retain bacterial cells passing through the filter media. The integration of anaerobic iron coated sand filter and aerobic sand filtration removed not only ferrous production but also improved the overall performance of the treatment system in removing bacteria. This dissertation has shown that the filters packed by iron-rich porous media provided technical and economic feasibilities to remove microbial contaminants in water reclamation. This knowledge could further improve our understanding of the fate and transport of fecal bacteria in the subsurface and sedimentary environments. Future work can be explored for the removal of pathogens enhanced by the mechanisms discovered in this study in engineering processes, such as storm water bio-retention facilities, aquifer artificial recharge, and low-cost soil based water reclamation...|$|R

40|$|Dye {{sensitized}} {{solar cells}} (DSC’s) have received considerable attention once this technology offers {{economic and environmental}} advantages over conventional photovoltaic (PV) devices. A DSC photoanode typically consists of a nanocrystalline porous TiO 2 film, endowed with a large <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface</b> area. Dye molecules that capture photons during device operation {{are attached to the}} film nanoparticles. The effective loading of the dye in the TiO 2 electrode is of paramount relevance for controlling and optimizing solar cell parameters. In particular, the cell shortcircuit current density (Jsc) is directly proportional to the light harvesting ability of the photoanode, which in turn is strictly dependent on the dye concentration on the TiO 2 <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface.</b> In addition, the dye adsorption behavior affects the cell open circuit voltage (Voc). Relatively few methods are known today for quantitative evaluation of the total dye adsorbed in the film. In this context microprobe techniques come out as suitable tools to evaluate the dye distribution and dye depth profile in sensitized films. Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA) and Ion Beam Analytical (IBA) techniques using a micro-ion beam were used to quantify and to study the distribution of the ruthenium organometallic (N 719) dye in TiO 2 films, making use of their different penetration depth and beam sizes. Two different types of films were prepared and sensitized, mesoporous nanoparticles and 1 D nanostructured TiO 2 films (about 4 ìm thickness). The high sensitive analytical techniques used allowed to assess dye surface distribution and depth profile, by means of Ru signal, despite the low concentration of this element. X-ray mapping by EPMA/WDS technique made possible to visualise the dye distribution in sample cross-section. PIXE maps of Ru and Ti indicated an homogeneous surface distribution. The assessment of ruthenium depth profile by RBS showed that some films have homogeneous Ru depth distribution while others presented up to half of the Ru concentration in the top layer (2 ìm thickness) when compared to the lower one. Dye load evaluation in different TiO 2 films by two different techniques (ìPIXE and EPMA/WDS) provided similar results of Ru/Ti. The assessment of the dye distribution and quantification across an oxide semiconductor film by microprobe techniques can lead {{to a better understanding of}} the device performance...|$|E
40|$|The greater {{susceptibility}} to desiccation of the Rhizobiurn legurninosarum group of rhizobia {{compared with the}} slow-growing rhizobia {{is related to the}} different amounts of water retained by these groups of bacteria at any relative vapour pressure, rather than differences in rates of water movement into or out of the bacteria. The higher retention of water by the R. legurninosarum group at any rela-tive vapour pressure is related to greater availability of <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface</b> area, and to higher surface energies resulting in a greater affinity for water. Although the internal osmotic pressure is greater in the slow-growing group than in the R. leguminosarum group, it is concluded that differences in internal solute concentra-tions cannot account for the different adsorption isotherms found for these groups. Montmorillonitic clay protects the fast-growing R. leguminosarum group from the effects of desiccation, but not the slow-growing group. Ca-montmorillonite retains greater quantities of water at any relative vapour pressure than either group of bacteria. Possible mechanisms of protection of the bacteria by the clay are discussed in terms of relative affinities for water under desiccation conditions...|$|E
30|$|It {{has been}} shown that CO 2 {{adsorption}} capacity of biochar is highly correlated with specific surface areas, with CO 2 adsorption increasing with increased pyrolysis temperature (Huang et al. 2015). It is also known that CO 2 adsorption capacity of biochar can reach a maximum value due to the limitations imposed by the <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface</b> of the biochar (Huang et al. 2015; Madzaki et al. 2016; Sigmund et al. 2017). We hypothesize that the observed stronger expression of negative priming effect at higher compared to lower biochar rate at a fixed manure application rates (Fig.  2) was caused by increased labile C with increasing manure rate, which, upon mineralization released relatively higher level of CO 2 -C that saturated biochar sorption sites. Thus, the increased CO 2 -C released from mineralization of the higher level of labile C in the higher manure rate saturated the surface and exceeded the upper limit of the amount of CO 2 -C that can be physically adsorbed by the biochar. This, subsequently, resulted in higher net CO 2 evolution at the higher manure compared to the lower application rate at a fix biochar rate.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] An {{equation}} {{that can}} successfully parameterize gas-particle partitioning is Kp(m 3 /~g- 1) =(F/TSP) /A, where Kp is a partitioning constant, TSP (pgm- 3) is {{the concentration of}} total suspended particulate material, and F (ngm- 3) and A (ngm- 3), respectively, are the particulate-associated an gaseous concentrations of the compound of interest. By itself, this equation does not indicate whether the partitioning isprimarily <b>adsorptive</b> to <b>surfaces,</b> primarily absorptive into some phase(s), or some combina-tion thereof. Much past research as indicated that plots of log Kp vs log p O (compound vapor pressure) tend to be highly correlated, with slopes near- 1. Such correlation isconsistent with (though not proof of) adsorption. The governing equations are now developed for absorptive partitioning into an organic material (om) phase making up part of the TSP. The equations indicate that absorptive partitioning could well be an important sorption mechanism inthe urban environment. Plots of log Kp vs log pO are predicted to be linearly correlated when the sorption is absorptive, just as earlier theoretical work predicted such correlatability when the sorption is adsorptive. In the general case, observed Kp values may contain contributions from both mechanisms. Regardless of {{the relative importance of}} adsorptive vs absorptive partitioning in any given situation, aplot of log Kp values vs log p ° Lvalues will be correlated with a slope of near- 1...|$|R

Materials with high hydrogen storage capacities are desirable for storage applications.

In this study, CNT's have been successfully synthesized by using catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) method. The as-synthesized CNTs were characterized using SEM/FE-SEM, EDAX, nitrogen adsorption (NA) and transmission electron microscope (TEM).

Death losses were low (approximately 6 %), but weight gain ceased for 2 weeks. Large numbers of rotavirus (reo-like) particles were seen by electron microscopy in diarrhetic fluids. Sections of intestines showed a loss of <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface</b> in that villi were shortened and fused with adjacent villi. Immunofluorescence revealed rotaviral antigens within damaged enterocytes. Rotavirus-containing gut fluid was harvested from sick, weaned piglets. This fluid, filtered free of bacteria, was used to inoculate per os colostrum-deprived piglets. These infected piglets developed diarrhea and dehydration, and large numbers of rotaviral particles were seen in their diarrhetic fluid. Also, rotaviral antigens were present in aberrant enterocytes, and the intestinal villi were shortened. Since the weaned piglets (3 weeks old) came from sows that were providing their piglet's intestine with passive antibody protection via milk, we concluded that the abrupt removal of the piglet from the gut-bathing antibody combined with the stress of weaning produced a neonate vulnerable to the ubiquitous rotavirus. Similar circumstances may prevail and operate in exacerbating rotaviral diarrhea in neonates of other species of mammals...|$|E

However, this parameter is non-appropriate because the used Fe 0 mass says nothing {{about the amount of}} in situ generated (1) reducing agents (FeII, H 2) and/or (2) contaminant collectors (iron oxides) during the experiment/application. The removal capacity (sometimes termed as ‘saturation’) is a parameter borrowed from adsorption literature (adsorptive removal). However, in the adsorption context, the <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface</b> (SSA) is available {{at the start of the}} experiment (t 0  =  0) and the experiments are stopped at equilibrium (t ∞ = t equilibrium). Depending on the size and the porosity of the adsorbent, the equilibrium can be achieved within some hours. In the context of Fe 0 remediation, an initial phase of increased contaminant removal is related to several processes including (1) Fe 0 oxidative dissolution and (ii) precipitation of iron oxides upon local sursaturation. In particular, a slower removal kinetic following an initial rapid uptake is likely due to changes in the kinetic of Fe 0 dissolution (Alamilla et al. 2009; Noubactep 2016 a). This stage is at best a pseudo-equilibrium and is only indirectly coupled to an adsorption process as co-precipitation also occur and is more difficult to quantify (Crawford et al. 1993 a, b).|$|E

40|$|The {{carboxylic}} ionophores monensin and nigericin, at concentrations {{higher than}} 10 and 6 muM, respectively, prevent the {{penetration of the}} Semliki Forest virus (SFV) genome into the cytosol of baby hamster kidney (BHK- 21) cells and thereby inhibit viral replication. In the absence of inhibitors, the entry of SFV is known to proceed by adsorptive endocytosis in coated vesicles, followed by acid-triggered membrane fusion in intracellular vacuoles or lysosomes. The results show that binding of the virus to the cell <b>surface,</b> <b>adsorptive</b> endocytosis, and intracellular transport of viruses to the lysosomes are only marginally affected by the ionophores. No direct virucidal effect is observed, nor is the membrane fusion activity of the virus at low pH directly affected. Sequential addition of monensin and ammonium chloride (a non-related lysosomotropic inhibitor of SFV entry) indicates that both inhibitors affect the same step in the entry pathway. On {{the basis of these}} data and the known effects of carboxylic ionophores and lysosomotropic weak bases on cellular pH gradients, we conclude that monensin inhibits penetration by increasing the pH in endocytic vacuoles and lysosomes above pH 6, which is the pH threshold for the viral membrane fusion activity...|$|R
40|$|Experiment was {{performed}} to draw a mercury adsorption stoichiometry of ceramic and activated carbon from aqueous phase in two parts - first part dealt with the effect of three different pH - 4, 7 and 10, whereas second part was designed {{to determine the effect}} of three temperatures - 15, 25 and 35 °C. SEM-EDS analysis of adsorbents clearly showed highly uneven and porous surface structure of activated carbon compared to ceramic that contains SiO 2 (73. 65 %) as a major constituent with negligible amount of metals, whereas C (98. 46 %) is the only constituent in activated carbon. Activated carbon exhibited 15 to 52 % (experiment of pH effect) and 49 to 70 % (experiment of temperature effect) higher adsorption efficiency than that of the ceramic, which inferred that the activated carbon is a proficient Hg adsorbent compared to the ceramic because of having greater available Hg <b>adsorptive</b> total <b>surface</b> area than ceramic and in contrary, high ionic competition on the surface of ceramic prevents more Hg adsorption from aqueous phase which is entirely absent in activated carbon. PH 7 and pH 4 revealed the highest Hg adsorption in ceramic and activated carbon, respectively. It also signified that pH 7 facilitates Hg adsorption reducing positive ions competition on the ceramic surface which is higher in rest of the pH levels, whereas pH 4 may be optimum to reduce HgCl 2 into Hg (I) over the remaining pH in activated carbon for adsorbing maximum Hg. In the experiment of temperature effects, highest temperature (35 °C) exhibited a higher rate of adsorption (ceramic 32 - 35 % and activated carbon 0. 13 - 0. 84 %) than the remaining temperatures. Therefore, it may also be concluded that highest temperature (35 °C) of the medium promotes the used adsorbents to remove higher quantity of Hg from water phase because surface group activity of adsorbents, ionization and movements of Hg ions increases with increasing temperature that leads to the higher rate of Hg adsorption...|$|R
40|$|Common {{conceptual}} {{models for}} unsaturated flow often {{rely on the}} oversimplified representation of medium pores as a bundle of cylindrical capillaries and assume that the matric potential is attributed to capillary forces only.

These models are successful at high and medium water contents but often give poor results at low water contents. These models {{do not apply to}} conditions at which water content is less than the residual water content. We extend the lower bound of existing water-retention functions and conductivity models from residual water content to the oven-dry condition (i. e., zero water content) by defining a state-dependent, residual-water content for a soil drier than a critical value. Furthermore, a hydraulic conductivity model for smooth uniform spheres was modified by introducing a correction factor to describe the film flow-induced hydraulic conductivity for natural porous media. The total unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is the sum of those due to capillary and film flow. The extended retention and conductivity models were verified with six datasets from the literature. Results show that, when the soil is at high and intermediate water content, there is no difference between the un-extended and the extended models; when the soil is at low water content, the un-extended models overestimate the water content but under-estimate the conductivity while the extended models match the retention and conductivity measurements well...|$|E
40|$|Arsenic {{contaminated}} waters are not uncommon; indeed from naturally occurring {{contaminated waters}} through {{to those that}} are {{a direct consequence of}} human activities such as mining, all are affecting the quality of water resources worldwide. The ever increasing demands on natural water resources mean that the effective control of this toxic contaminant is paramount and this is reflected in the ever increasing global legislation. There are currently three mechanisms by which arsenic is commercially treated in effluents. These are physical separation processes such as reverse osmosis, precipitation/adsorption processes, some of which are bacterially assisted, and a whole variety of ion exchange processes, again with some bacterial enhancement. The choice of treatment is not only driven by cost but by the chemistry of the water and the water quality standard to be met. In this study a very high arsenic enriched groundwater, containing in excess of 25, 000 µg/L arsenic, was treated by a typical treatment method through a continuously operated pilot plant. In the treatment, iron III salts were added to the influent in order to form precipitates with the arsenic and to form an <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface</b> that would assist with treatment of the enriched water. This addition of iron III salts for the removal of arsenic is common practice in the water treatment industry as the resulting iron III arsenates are highly stable. However, results from the pilot plant show that the process was further enhanced by the small addition hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is a powerful oxidising reagent and assists in ensuring the complete conversion of any arsenic III to arsenic V that was then effectively removed in the pilot plant. After treatment residual arsenic levels of 10 µg/L were obtained compared to 68 µg/L without oxidation reagent addition...|$|E
40|$|Dye {{sensitized}} {{solar cells}} (DSCs) have received considerable attention once this technology offers {{economic and environmental}} advantages over conventional photovoltaic (PV) devices. The PV performance of a DSC relies {{on the characteristics of}} its photoanode, which typically consists of a nanocrystalline porous TiO 2 film, enabled with a large <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface</b> area. Dye molecules that capture photons from light during device operation are attached to the film nanoparticles. The effective loading of the dye in the TiO 2 electrode is of paramount relevance for controlling and optimizing solar cell parameters. Relatively few methods are known today for quantitative evaluation of the total dye adsorbed on the film. In this context, microprobe techniques come out as suitable tools to evaluate the dye surface distribution and depth profile in sensitized films. Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA) and Ion Beam Analytical (IBA) techniques using a micro-ion beam were used to quantify and to study the distribution of the Ru organometallic dye in TiO 2 films, making use of the different penetration depth and beam sizes of each technique. Different 1 D nanostructured TiO 2 films were prepared, morphologically characterized by SEM, sensitized and analyzed by the referred techniques. Dye load evaluation in different TiO 2 films by three different techniques (PIXE, RBS and EPMA/WDS) provided similar results of Ru/Ti mass fraction ratio. Moreover, it was possible to assess dye surface distribution and its depth profile, by means of Ru signal, and to visualize the dye distribution in sample cross-section through X-ray mapping by EPMA/EDS. PIXE maps of Ru and Ti indicated an homogeneous surface distribution. The assessment of Ru depth profile by RBS showed that some films have homogeneous Ru depth distribution while others present different Ru concentration in the top layer (2 lm thickness). These results are consistent with the EPMA/EDS maps obtained...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Corrosion is {{a serious}} problem faced by all the industries. The use of inhibitors is a simple and cost {{effective}} method to control corrosion. This paper reports the synthesis of a novel Schiff base and its application as corrosion inhibitor for mild steel. Methodology: Inhibition behaviour of synthesized Schiff base for the corrosion of mild steel in 1 M H 2 SO 4 was studied by weight loss measurements, potentiodynamic polarization, and andelectrochemical impedance spectra. Results: The results revealed that the efficiency depends on concentration of the inhibitor and temperature. The inhibitor obeys Langmuir isotherm indicating monolayer adsorption on the mild steel surface. Thermodynamic parameters show that the adsorption of the inhibitor on mild steel surface occurs through electrostatic attraction. Polarization studies show that the inhibitor behaves as mixed type in 1 M H 2 SO 4 affecting both anodic metal dissolution and cathodic hydrogen evolution. The formation of <b>surface</b> <b>adsorptive</b> film of the Schiff base on the mild steel surface was confirmed by SEM and EDX studies. Conclusion: The prepared Schiff base is found {{to be a very good}} inhibitor for the mild steel corrosion in sulphuric acid media even at low concentration offers more than 90 % inhibition efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The isotherms {{of excess}} {{adsorption}} of CH 4 (at P = 0. 001 – 160 MPa), SF 6 (at P = 0. 001 – 2. 4 MPa), and C 6 H 6 (at P = 0. 0001 – 0. 1 MPa) on carbon adsorbents—microporous carbons CMS and FAS with developed mesoporosity and graphitized soot—were {{measured in the}} 298 – 408 K temperature region. Calculation of the isotherms of absolute adsorption of the total content of these substances requires knowledge of the adsorption volume, which was determined by different methods: by the Dubinin—Radushkevich equation; by the experimental isotherm of excess adsorption and the equation of absolute adsorption; by the method using the intersection of nonlinear isosteres of excess adsorption and isosteres of absolute adsorption; by the comparative plot of values of the excess C 6 H 6 adsorption Γ FAS —Γ soor; by the method using the difference of molecular radii of <b>adsorptives</b> and the <b>surface</b> of the specific adsorbent; and by the calculation of the adsorption layer thickness using the FHH equation for mesoporous systems. The results of determination of the adsorption volume for microporous systems of these carbons agree well {{with each other and}} with the passport data for the adsorbents. Analysis of the results revealed the peculiarity of the sulfur hexafluoride adsorption related to the formation of associates on the surface of the carbon adsorbents...|$|R
40|$|Increasing energy demands {{as well as}} the {{depletion}} of traditional energy sources has led to the need for the development and improvement of energy conversion and storage technologies. Concerns regarding climate change and environmental awareness has also created increased support for renewable energy and clean technology research. One technology of interest is the photocatalyst, which is a material that is able to use natural light irradiation to create electrical currents or drive useful chemical reactions. For this purpose, a strong photocatalytic material has the following properties: i) strong absorbance over a wide solar radiation spectrum; ii) high surface area for adsorbance of target species; iii) high electron efficiency characteristics such as high conductivity, long charge-carrier lifetimes, and direct pathways for electron transport; and iv) good chemical stability. All of these requirements serve to maximize the efficiency and overall output of the device, and are a means of overcoming the performance hurdle required for the commercialization of various energy conversion technologies. Unfortunately, current photocatalytic materials suffer from small absorbance windows and high recombination rates which greatly reduce the conversion efficiency of the catalyst. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2), the most well-known and widely used photocatalyst, can only absorb light within the ultraviolet (UV) range – which accounts for {{only a small fraction of}} the entire solar spectrum. For this reason, the majority of recent research has been directed toward producing photocatalysts that are able to absorb light within the visible and infrared range in order to maximize the amount of light absorbed in the solar spectrum. Other research is also being conducted to increase electrical conductivity and charge-carrier separation to further increase conversion efficiency. It is hoped that these two major problems surrounding photocatalysis can be solved by using novel functional nanomaterials. Nanomaterials can be synthesized using three main techniques: crystal structuring, doping, and heterostructuring. By controlling the structure of the crystal, materials of different phase, morphology, and exposed crystal facets can be synthesized. These are important for controlling the electronic properties and surface reactivity of the photocatalyst. Doping is the act of introducing impurities into a material in order to modify its band structure and create a red shift in light absorption. Lastly, heterostructuring is a method used to combine different photocatalysts or introduce co-catalysts in order to widen the range of absorption, encourage charge separation, or both. Many novel photocatalytic materials have been synthesized using these techniques. However, the next-generation photocatalytic material has remained elusive due to the high cost of production and complexity of synthesis. This thesis proposes a novel photocatalytic material that can be used in photocatalyzed waste-water remediation. Graphene-wrapped hierarchical TiO 2 nanoflowers (G-TiO 2) are synthesized using a facile synthesis method. TiO 2 is a material of particular interest due to its chemical and photo-corrosion stability, high redox potential, strong electronic properties, and relative non-toxicity. Hierarchical structures are highly desired because they are able to achieve both high surface area and high conductivities. Graphene hybridization is a popular method for creating composites with highly conductive networks and highly <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surfaces.</b> To the best of my knowledge, the hybridization of graphene on hierarchical TiO 2 structures without pre-functionalization of TiO 2 has not yet been demonstrated in literature. Therefore, it is proposed that the use of such a material would greatly simplify the synthesis process and enhance the overall photocatalytic performance of TiO 2 over that of commercial TiO 2 photocatalysts. In the first study, hierarchical TiO 2 nanoflowers are synthesized using a solvothermal reaction. It is then shown that under UV irradiation, the hierarchical TiO 2 material is able to outperform commercial TiO 2 material in the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB). Further characterization shows that this improvement is explained by a higher electrical conductivity, and exists in spite of having a lower specific surface area compared to the commercial material. In the second study, G-TiO 2 is synthesized by mixing hierarchical TiO 2 nanoflowers with graphene oxide (GO) and reducing GO in a hydrothermal reaction. Photocatalytic tests show that this hybridization further improves the performance of the hierarchical TiO 2. Further studies reveal that an optimal graphene loading of 5 wt% is desired in order to achieve the higher rate of MB decomposition, and greatly outperforms P 25 in this task. Characterization shows that G-TiO 2 composites have increased specific surface area and electrical conductivity compared to the hierarchical TiO 2 nanoflower. It is believed that this work will provide a simple and efficient avenue for synthesizing graphene–TiO 2 composites with greatly improved photocatalytic activity. This work may also find use in other photocatalytic applications such as chemical deconstruction and manufacturing, hydrogen production, solar cells, and solar enhanced fuel cells...|$|R
40|$|Leaves {{of young}} barley (Hordeum vulgare cv Arivat) {{seedlings}} were examined anatomically, physiologically and cytologically to infer the pathway of transpirational water movement {{and to understand}} {{the basis for the}} selective responsiveness of the growing region to osmotic stress. Vessels with open lumens were found to extend from the intercalary meristem to the expanded blade, and all vessels are present in 5 functional vascular bundles (FVB) which are separated by 20 to 30 closely packed mesophyll cells and 2 to 3 immature vascular bundles (IVB). Heat pulse transport data confirmed the anatomical suggestion that water will move throughout the leaf in open vessels and they showed also that osmotic stress will reduce water transport within 1 min, which is before transpiration is lowered. Water representing about 2 per cent of the total tissue water was obtained by centrifuging cut sections of the growing region at 5 X g against an <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface.</b> This water is probably xylem plus cell wall water because it is easily removed, its volume is 2 X that calculated to be in the vessels, and it exchanges more readily with the water in the nutrient solution than the bulk tissue water. This lack of free exchange indicates apoplastic water is somewhat separated from mesophyll cells, and it is hypothesized that osmotic stress causes sudden growth cessation and initation of metabolic changes because (a) reduced water availability together with ongoing transpiration will cause a sudden reduction in the xylem's water potential, (b) there is a lateral transmission of this reduced water potential through walls of all cells in the growing region, and (c) cells can respond in some way to changes in water potential around them. Most cells in the expanded blade are considered unresponsive to osmotic stress because transpirational water will move predominantly from the 5 FVB through the closest stomata, so only cells closest to those bundles will be altered rapidly by stress...|$|E
40|$|Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a {{well-known}} sampling and sample preparation technique used {{for a wide variety}} of analytical applications. As there are various complex processes taking place at the time of extraction that influence the parameters of optimum extraction, a mathematical model and computational simulation describing the SPME process is required for experimentalists to understand and implement the technique without performing multiple costly and time-consuming experiments in the laboratory. In this thesis, a mechanistic mathematical model for the processes occurring in SPME extraction of analyte(s) from an aqueous sample medium is presented. The proposed mechanistic model was validated with experimental data. Several key factors that affect the extraction kinetics, such as sample agitation, fiber coating thickness, and presence of a binding matrix component, are discussed. More interestingly, for the first time, shorter or longer equilibrium times in the presence of a binding matrix component were explained with the help of an asymptotic analysis. Parameters that contribute to the variation of the equilibrium times are discussed, with the assumption that one binding matrix component is present in a static sample. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed model captures the phenomena occurring in SPME, leading to a clearer understanding of this process. Therefore, the currently presented model can be used to identify optimum experimental parameters without the need to perform a large number of experiments in the laboratory. A calibration approach based on standard chemicals loaded onto an extraction phase (calibrant-loaded extraction phase, CL-EP) has gained popularity in various areas of sample analysis, such as environmental, toxicological, and tissue sampling research areas. In this thesis, the kinetics of calibrant release and analyte uptake between the sample and extraction phase with a finite-element analysis (FEA) using COMSOL Multiphysics® software package. Effect of finite and infinite sample volume conditions, as well as various sample environment parameters such as fluid flow velocity, temperature, and presence of a binding matrix component were investigated in detail with the model in relation to the performance of the calibration. The simulation results demonstrate the suitability of the CL-EP method for analysis of samples at various sample environments. The calibrant-loaded approach can provide both total and free concentrations from a single experiment based on whether the Kes value being used is measured in a matrix-matched sample or in a matrix-free sample, respectively. Total concentrations can also be obtained by utilizing CL-EP in combination with external matrix-matched calibration, which can be employed to automate the sampling process and provide corrections for variations in sample preparation, matrix effects, and detection processes. This approach is also suitable for very small volumes of sample, where addition of an internal standard in the sample is either troublesome or can change the sample characteristics. Although the outcome of this study is applicable to any sampler based on calibrant-loaded liquid or solid extraction phase method, experimental data using a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) sampler was used to fit our simulation results. The numerical results are in very good agreement with the experimental data reported previously. Moreover, the computational model and numerical simulation presented will aid in the optimization of sampler design and sampling parameters prior to laboratory experiments, which will translate into savings in terms of time and expensive chemicals. Despite the prevalence of porous-particle based coatings used for microextraction techniques, there is inadequate understanding of how extraction parameters influence the extracted amount and quantification of analytes. This is particularly important when extraction is performed with these solid coatings under pre-equilibrium conditions, for instance, with diffusion based rapid calibration approach which is a popular technique for on-site chemical analysis for not requiring any calibration method or internal standards. This study presents a computational model for porous particle-based coatings used in solid phase microextraction. Although the model describes extraction behavior of analytes for both kinetic and equilibrium regime of extraction profile, the critical parameters for the diffusion based rapid sampling were studied using the developed model. Simulations are conducted under variations in both mass transfer and <b>adsorptive</b> <b>surface</b> binding constants, coating capacity, constrained by real-world experimental conditions of finite and infinite sample volume. The model simulation results demonstrated excellent correlation with previously reported experimental data and superior to previous semi-empirical models. In the last chapter of the thesis, a novel SPME coating functionalized with a DNA aptamer for selective enrichment of a low abundance protein from diluted human plasma is described. This approach is based on the covalent immobilization of an aptamer ligand on electrospun microfibers made with the hydrophilic polymer poly(acrylonitrile-co-maleic acid) (PANCMA) on stainless steel rods. A plasma protein, human alpha-thrombin, was employed as a model protein for selective extraction by the developed Apt-SPME probe, and the detection was carried out with liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). The SPME probe exhibited highly selective capture, good binding capacity, high stability and good repeatability for the extraction of thrombin. The protein selective probe was employed for direct extraction of thrombin from 20 -fold diluted human plasma samples without any other purification. The Apt-SPME method coupled with LC–MS/MS provided a good linear dynamic range of 0. 5 – 50 nM in diluted human plasma with a good correlation coefficient (R 2 = 0. 9923), and the detection limit of the proposed method was found to be 0. 30 nM. Finally, the Apt-SPME coupled with LC–MS/MS method was successfully utilized for the determination of thrombin in clinical human plasma samples. One shortcoming of the method is its reduced efficiency in undiluted human plasma compared to the standard solution. Nevertheless, this new aptamer affinity-based SPME probe opens up the possibility of selective enrichment of a given targeted protein from complex sample either in vivo or ex vivo...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of mutual protective action in dual systems of hydrous oxides {{has been studied}} extensively at The Rice Institute. A variety of systems has been studied and {{in many of these}} systems each oxide prevents or retards the crystallization of the other. The degree of mutual protection varies from system to system and also depends upon the temperature level at which the dual gels have been heated. The system BeO-In 2 O 3 was first studied in 1947 by Watt by x-ray diffraction techniques. Marked mutual protection was observed in this system in two composition zones. Only the diffraction pattern of cubic In 2 O 3 was observed for any sample containing In 2 O 3, agreeing with the observations of Ensslin and Valentiner. Extensive sorption-desorption studies have been made by the author on the system BeO-In 2 O 3, heat-treated for 2 hours at 500 °. From these studies <b>surface</b> areas, specific <b>adsorptive</b> capacities, differential and integral heats of adsorption, and pore size distributions were obtained. Enhanced <b>adsorptive</b> capacities, <b>surface</b> areas, and differential and integral heats of adsorption were observed in the same composition zones which had previously shown protection against crystallization. It is noted that there are two major regions of increased <b>surface</b> area and <b>adsorptive</b> capacity, at a region corresponding to 40 [...] 60 % BeO and at a region corresponding to 90 % BeO. The enhanced <b>surface</b> area and <b>adsorptive</b> capacity has been explained on the basis of mutual protection against crystallization, utilizing the concept of adsorption of one oxide on the other in the solid state. The differential and integral heats of adsorption as a function of composition at various values of the relative pressurer show two maxima exist, one between 30 % BeO and 60 % BeO, the other between 80 % BeO and 90 % BeO. These are essentially the same composition ranges in which there is mutual protection against crystallization and an increase in <b>surface</b> area and <b>adsorptive</b> capacity. If these zones correspond to smaller crystal size, and it will be shown that this is the case, the increase in heat of adsorption may be explained on the basis of increase of heterogeneity of the surface, due to a larger predominance of cracks, crevices, sharp edges and the like for an assembly of smaller crystals. The purpose of the present investigation is an attempt to elucidate the structure of these gels, especially in the zones of mutual protection...|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The nanophase diamond has been studied as an alternative for solid hydrogen storage, first by the affinity of carbon and hydrogen, and second because of the high volumetric storage of this material due to the physical and chemical effects at the nanoscale level. It is a potential solid storage medium by its high surface area and high surface energy, and exhibits good characteristics for adsorption as evidenced by the nitrogen adsorption curves. This thesis describes how to treat the nanophase diamond powder surface to achieve a higher hydrogen concentration, and increase desorption to adsorption ratio by the incorporation of metals, including from alkali and transition groups, and a metalloid. This metal-support cooperation is essential to develop a bifunctional catalysis as a fast diffusion mechanism for transferring the adsorbed species from the catalyst site to the support surface and vice versa. The effect of temperature and pressure variation to increase hydrogen storage in the nanodiamond structure is also higher for treated surfaces. The physical and chemical modifications of the nanophase diamond powder enhanced its catalytic and <b>adsorptive</b> properties.

40|$|Adsorption {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used methods in water treatment processes. It is attractive due to it easy operation and the availability of a wide variety of commercial adsorbents. This doctoral thesis focuses on investigating and explaining the influence of external phase conditions (temperature, pH, ionic strength, acidity, presence of cosolutes) on adsorption phenomena. In order to cover a wide range of factors and phenomena, case studies were chosen from various fields where adsorption is applied. These include the <b>adsorptive</b> removal of <b>surface</b> active agents (used in cleaning chemicals, for example) from aqueous effluents, the removal of hormones (estradiol) from drinking water, and the adsorption of antibiotics onto silica. The latter can beused to predict the diffusion of antibiotics in the aquatic system if they are released into the environment. Also the adsorption of living cells on functionalized polymers to purify infected water streams was studied. In addition to these examples, the adsorptive separation of harmful compounds from internal water streams within a chemical process was investigated. The model system was removal of fermentation inhibitors from lignocelluloses hydrolyzates. The detoxification of the fermentation broth is an important step in the manufacture of bioethanol from wood, but has not been studied previously in connection with concentrated acid hydrolyzates. New knowledge on adsorption phenomena was generated for all of the applications investigated. In most cases, the results could be explained by combining classical theories for individual phenomena. As an example, it was demonstrated how liquid phase aggregation could explain abnormal-looking adsorption equilibrium data. In addition to the fundamental phenomena, also process performance was of interest. This aspect is often neglected in adsorption studies. It was demonstrated that adsorbents should not be selected for a target application based on their adsorption properties only, but regeneration of the spent adsorbent must be considered. It was found that using a suitable amount of organic co-solvent in the regeneration can significantly improve the productivity of the process...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of water salinity and sodicity on pore size distribution and plant-available water of two clay and sandy clay loam calcareous soils. All combinations of water EC values of 0. 5, 2, 4 and 8 dS m- 1 and SAR values of 1, 5, 13 and 18 (in total 16 solutions) were used to wet and dry the soil samples for five cycles. Then, water retention of the soil cores was measured at matric suctions of 0 (θs), 10 (θ 10) 100 or 300 cm (θFC) and 15000 cm (θPWP). The following quantities were calculated: the difference between θ 100 or θ 300 and θ 15000 considered as available water contrent, the θs and θ 10 as macrorosity, the θ 10 and θ 100 as mesoporosity, and the θ 100 as microrosity. The initial porosity of both soils was similar, but the greater values of pore indices and θFC, θPWP and AWC were measured in the clay soil due to clay swelling. As water EC increased, mesopores were destructed and altered to macropores and micropores. Salinity altered the mesopores into macropores due to contraction of diffuse double layer and particle’s flocculation and consequently decreased the θFC, and created new micropores which were responsible for the higher value of θPWP. These trends ultimately diminished the AWC. As water SAR increased, mesopores were destructed and altered to micropores but it did not significantly affect the macropores. With increment of SAR, both θFC and θPWP increased due to structural distruption clay swelling and dispersion resulting in increased <b>adsorptive</b> and interlayer <b>surfaces.</b> The increasing effect of SAR on θPWP was greater and more distinct so that AWC was reduced. As a result, high values of SAR of irrigation water decreased the soil available water to plants besides its toxicity and hazardous effect on plants. With increment of irrigation water salinity, the destructive impacts of SAR diminished. The influence of water quality on water retention was pronounced for the clay soil. ...|$|R
