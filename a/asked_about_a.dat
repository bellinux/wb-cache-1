5|$|In 2008, {{there were}} rumors of a {{three-dimensional}} Kid Icarus game for the Wii that was allegedly developed by the German American studio Factor 5. However, the title {{was said to be}} in production without the approval of Nintendo, and Factor 5 cancelled multiple projects following the closure of its American branch in early 2009. In a 2010 interview, Yoshio Sakamoto was <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> Kid Icarus game for the Wii, to which he replied that he was not aware of any plans to revive the franchise. A new series entry for the Nintendo 3DS, , was eventually revealed at the E3 2010 trade show and was released in 2012. The game is a 3D shooter, and was developed by Project Sora, the company of Super Smash Bros. designer Masahiro Sakurai.|$|E

25|$|Later in the 1990s {{came the}} DeZarn case. It {{began with an}} {{investigation}} into possible Hatch Act violations by officers of the Kentucky National Guard. Key to the case was a 1990 Preakness Day party attended by Robert DeZarn, later made adjutant general by Brereton Jones after the latter was elected governor. DeZarn was being questioned about that party by Col. Robert Tripp of the Army Inspector General's office, under oath, when he was mistakenly <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> 1991 party, which was not at issue. He testified truthfully about it. As a result, the investigators issued a report that the allegations were unsubstantiated.|$|E

25|$|Swanson invited Will Hays {{for lunch}} and {{summarized}} the plot, naming the author and the sticking points. According to Swanson, Hays made a verbal promise he would {{have no problem with}} the making of such a film. Swanson set out to get the rights to the play by having Schenck pretend to buy it in the name of United Artists, never to be used. They were able to obtain the story rights for $60,000 instead of the original $100,000. When news broke concerning just what was intended with the play, the three authors threatened to sue. Swanson later contacted Maugham about rights to a sequel, and he offered to grant them for $25,000. Maugham claimed Fox had <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> sequel at the same time Swanson had bought the original story's rights. The sequel was to follow the further exploits of Sadie in Australia, but was never made.|$|E
25|$|After the Champions Trophy the {{captaincy}} {{reverted to}} Andrew Flintoff {{as soon as}} he was cleared as being match fit. Strauss started the tour badly, scoring only 71 runs from the first four innings along with a generally terrible display from England. After losing the first two Tests, questions were <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> divided dressing room owing to the captaincy changing hands so frequently between Strauss and Flintoff but Strauss played down these accusations. He followed this with 88 in a warm up match but in the following Test he was given out to dubious decisions in both innings, caught for 42 and LBW for a duck, with replays suggesting both decisions were harsh. In the Boxing Day Test Strauss secured his only landmark of the series with an even 50 though he will most likely remembered as Shane Warne's 700th Test victim as the Australian spin bowler reached the milestone in his penultimate Test match, by which point the Ashes had been lost. As if the five match whitewash was not enough, the final innings of the series for Strauss was marked with a bouncer to the head from Brett Lee causing him to go to hospital after he was dismissed. After the Test series, coach Duncan Fletcher lamented the lack of confidence in both Strauss and Paul Collingwood whom he had wished to promote as role models for the rest of the team. Despite the decline in his form towards the end of the year, poor umpiring decisions were taken into account and Strauss was picked as part of the 2006 Wisden Forty.|$|E

500|$|Potential {{weaknesses}} of a McCain candidacy included his senatorial accomplishments skewing towards the maverick side {{rather than those}} that would appeal to the party core, a lack of funds and of fund-raising prowess, and an unpredictability of personality and temperament.

He oversaw {{tax cuts and}} advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so {{that the government would}} not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down. In 2007, when <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, [...] "I'm comfortable with a requirement – you can call it whatever you want, but at some point we're {{going to have to get}} serious about how we deal with this issue".|$|E
500|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1964 and 1965, Dylan moved from folk {{songwriter}} to folk-rock pop-music star.

A London reporter wrote: [...] "Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of Leicester Square. He looks like an undernourished cockatoo." [...] Dylan began to spar with interviewers. Appearing on the Les Crane television show and <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> movie he planned, he told Crane it would be a cowboy horror movie.

The Millennium Choir performed the Lacrimosa sequence ("Lacrimosa dies illa Qua resurget ex favilla Judicandus homo reus. Huic ergo parce, Deus: Pie Jesu Domine, Dona eis requiem. Amen.") and backing vocals throughout the song. Lee, the orchestra and choir recorded the song at a chapel in Seattle, Washington. In a number of interviews, Lee revealed that everyone <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> collaboration between her and Mozart. She further stated that she always wanted to make Lacrimosa from Mozart's Requiem a metal song, later adding that The Open Door was [...] "the time for that, for trying things I hadn't been brave enough to try before."

The bonus tracks were set to include covers of Rush and Boston songs. Bello stated that {{the plan was to}} release the reissue in the fall of 2012. A few days later, band members announced that five covers were included: [...] "Anthem" [...] by Rush, [...] "Smokin'" [...] by Boston, [...] "Neon Knights" [...] by Black Sabbath, [...] "T.N.T." [...] by AC/DC, and [...] "Keep on Runnin'" [...] by Journey. Although Scott Ian expected the reissue to be released {{by the end of the}} year, it was eventually postponed for 2013. The special edition of Worship Music was released on March 22, 2013 by Nuclear Blast. It consists of the original album and a bonus EP of cover songs, Anthems, which was also released separately on the same day in Europe, and three days earlier in North America.|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, Ray Davies told The Independent {{that while}} a {{full-fledged}} reunion was unlikely, [...] "I {{will continue to}} play with ex-band members like Mick Avory from time to time. With Dave, {{a lot of it}} is psychological. I'll guide him in, and coerce and nurture him, and when the time is right I suppose I'll even shout at him again." [...] When <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> possible reunion in an interview that year, Avory stated, [...] "A reunion would not be possible with the originals, for a start due to ill health. But it would be possible with the Kast Off Kinks plus Ray. In any event Ray would record new material. We have some old tracks from the 80s as well." [...] In March 2010, Avory reported that the band were planning on releasing an album of unreleased and new material. He stated that they had [...] "eight tracks" [...] ready for the album, but that the Davies brothers had to settle their differences before the project could progress. It remains unclear who has been involved in the recordings besides Avory and Ray Davies.|$|E
500|$|Claudia Black and Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) linked their characters' early {{relationship}} to a Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn dynamic of [...] "not {{so much of}} tension, but rather constant antagonism". Despite the concern in early season 9 that their relationship would stagnate and dumb down their characters, Shanks felt Vala brought out a side of Daniel {{that he had not}} had the chance to play before, and Black advocated the slow revelation of Vala's layers of denial. The writers continued to develop the friendship between Vala and Daniel throughout season 10, aiming not to lose their sexual chemistry. Michael Shanks stated that by [...] "Memento Mori", [...] "Daniel legitimately cares about Vala and has seen some sort of redemption in her and wants that process to continue." [...] From Black's point of view, Daniel offers [...] "an interesting window" [...] into [...] "Vala's external façade to be playful with people". He helps Vala grow as a person and forces her to [...] "develop coping mechanisms that allow her to be more adult and learn that it's OK to be honest and talk how you feel." [...] <b>Asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> possible romance between Vala and Daniel before the filming of the series finale, Black predicted that a consummation of the relationship would end badly in terms of both story and on-screen chemistry. When producer Robert C. Cooper presented his preliminary script for the series finale, [...] "Unending", both Black and Shanks protested his intended story of having Vala and Daniel sleep together without a confrontation. Shanks felt that [...] "here's always been this underlining, keeping [...] at arms length because of the fear of getting too close." [...] After Cooper rewrote the scene to increase Vala's vulnerability to Daniel, and have Daniel truthfully explain his feelings of a relationship, the actors decided to play the confrontation scene as genuinely as possible, with both characters being neither completely in-character nor totally out-of-character.|$|E
