5|$|Between 2007 and 2012 {{an average}} of 30,000 {{visitors}} came to the tower each year, with non-English speaking visitors making up a high proportion. The architecture of the tower has made it <b>a</b> <b>challenging</b> site to operate as a tourist attraction; the fluctuating heat and humidity, and capacity constraints, have prevented it being adapted to house more delicate historical artefacts or accommodate additional visitor numbers.|$|E
5|$|Gilroy {{originally}} {{wanted to}} make a film about the life of American photographer Weegee, but switched focus after discovering the unique narrative possibilities surrounding the stringer profession. He wrote Lou as an antihero, based on the ideas of unemployment and capitalism. Gyllenhaal played a pivotal role in the film's production, from choosing members of the crew to watching audition tapes. Filming took place over the course of four weeks, and was <b>a</b> <b>challenging</b> process that included over eighty locations.|$|E
5|$|Helvellyn may be {{included}} in a traverse of the full length of the Helvellyn range in either direction, but with a greater sense of climax when starting from the north. Most of the ridge track is a bridleway and so the route can be completed by mountain bike in <b>a</b> <b>challenging</b> six-hour circular route of 16 miles off-road and 10 miles on-road riding. This may begin (and finish) at Mill Bridge near Grasmere.|$|E

5|$|The {{issue of}} the radius of the {{electron}} is <b>a</b> <b>challenging</b> problem of the modern theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises {{of the theory of}} relativity. On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron tending to infinity.|$|E

5|$|Cole faced <b>a</b> <b>challenging</b> {{time in the}} lead-up to Rio Paralympics. She {{reflects}} “I {{was still}} questioning if I was worthy to be there heading in – and I knew that I was, but it’s amazing that even after the amount of psychological sports training that I’ve had, those thoughts still {{come in and take}} you down… Usually the athletes who win are the ones who can put those thoughts aside, and tell themselves that they’ve got a good crack at winning.” Meanwhile, Cole put those thoughts aside and went on to win 6 medals at Rio.|$|E

5|$|In 1934 Marcinkus was {{transferred}} to the air reconnaissance department, there he started improving his expertise in independent flying, mapping, photography, and weapon systems. 1934 proved to be <b>a</b> <b>challenging</b> year for Marcinkus. Antanas Gustaitis, a prominent Lithuanian aircraft constructor and commander of Lithuanian Military Aviation, invited Marcinkus to participate in a trans-European flight, along with Jonas Liorentas, Juozas Namikas, Jonas Mikėnas, and Kazys Rimkevičius. After detailed planning and preparation, the trans-European flight was begun in the same year. During the 25 days of their flight, the pilots flew three of Gustaitis' designed aircraft, the ANBO IVs, over 10,000 kilometers and visited 12 European capitals. The Lithuanian pilots were warmly welcomed in the countries they visited. They were received by the British Royal Family and the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.|$|E

Zakuani started the match and came off at half-time with Congo in the lead. Mali rallied in the second half, beating Congo in a 3–1 loss.|$|E
5|$|McMillin's {{success in}} Louisiana {{allowed him to}} move on to Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, where he was the school's 13th head {{football}} coach for three seasons (1925–1927). His coaching record at Geneva was 22 wins, 6 losses and 1 tie, and {{he is a member of}} the Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame. Geneva College fans generally consider McMillin among the best coaches in school history.

40|$|This paper {{adopts a}} labor market {{economics}} perspective {{to understanding the}} crisis of health care professionals in Africa. Five challenges resulting from this crisis are identified: <b>a</b> production <b>challenge,</b> <b>an</b> underutilization <b>challenge,</b> <b>a</b> distributional <b>challenge,</b> <b>a</b> performance <b>challenge,</b> and <b>a</b> financing <b>challenge.</b> Differences between the labor market approach and others used in the health field are noted.

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} examples of genre science fiction that involves <b>a</b> <b>challenging</b> amount of unconventional sexual activity is the early novel Odd John (1935), by Olaf Stapledon. John is a mutant with extraordinary mental abilities who will not allow himself to be bound {{by many of the}} rules imposed by the ordinary British society of his time. The novel strongly implies that he seduces an older boy who becomes devoted to him but also suffers from the affront that the relationship creates to his own morals.|$|E
5|$|Sense8 was edited in the Wachowskis' {{headquarters}} in Chicago, Kinowerks, by Joe Hobeck and Joseph Jett Sally {{in the first}} season and by Sally and Fiona Colbeck in the second. Sally previously worked with the Wachowskis as first assistant editor on Speed Racer and editor on Ninja Assassin. The Wachowskis found editing a TV show to be <b>a</b> <b>challenging</b> process because of the required fast turnaround times. Lilly commented that for a feature film they get a minimum of ten weeks for editing as mandated by the Directors Guild of America, while for the first season of Sense8 {{they had to be}} moving at a pace of completing two 1-hour episodes (roughly the equivalent of a feature film) every two weeks.|$|E

40|$|We propose <b>a</b> Theory of <b>Challenge</b> and Threat States in Athletes (TCTSA) {{which is}} an {{amalgamation}} and extension of the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat, the model of adaptive approaches to competition and the debilitative and facilitative competitive state anxiety model. In the TCTSA we posit that selfefficacy, perceptions of control, and achievement goals determine challenge or threat states in response to competition. Distinct patterns of neuroendocrine and cardiovascular responses are indicative of <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> or threat state. Increases in epinephrine and cardiac activity, {{and a decrease in}} total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR) characterise <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> state and increases in cortisol, smaller increases in cardiac activity and either no change or an increase in TPR characterise a threat state. Positive and negative emotions can occur in <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> state while <b>a</b> threat state is associated with negative emotions only. Emotions are perceived as helpful to performance in <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> state but not in <b>a</b> threat state. <b>Challenge</b> and threat states influence effort, attention, decision�making and physical functioning and accordingly sport performance. The TCTSA provides a framework for practitioners to enhance performance, through developing <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> state, and encourages researchers to explore the mechanisms underlying performance in competition...|$|R
