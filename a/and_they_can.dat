When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce. Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly. They are also used (cooked) in meat dishes.|$|E

5|$|Freelancer {{features}} a multiplayer mode, allowing up to 128players to play {{together in a}} game.

Gameplay is similar to the single-player mode, but is absent of story-driven quests. The server keeps individual records of the players' progress, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> resume their game on their next log on to this server. A persistent virtual galaxy is thus maintained for them.|$|E

Many of the more durable hoodoos are capped with a type of magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite. Dolomite dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath.|$|E

5|$|Plant {{defense against}} {{herbivory}} or host-plant resistance (HPR) describes {{a range of}} adaptations evolved by plants which improve their survival and reproduction by reducing the impact of herbivores. Plants can sense being touched, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> use several strategies to defend against damage caused by herbivores. Many plants produce secondary metabolites, known as allelochemicals, that influence the behavior, growth, or survival of herbivores. These chemical defenses can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores, or reduce plant digestibility.|$|E

5|$|Ebla was a polytheistic state. During {{the first}} kingdom, Eblaites worshiped their dead kings. The pantheon {{of the first}} Ebla {{included}} pairs of deities <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be separated into three genres; {{in the first and}} most common one, there were the couples, such as the deity and his female consort. The second type of pairs was the divine twosomes, such as the deities that cooperate to create the cosmos, like in the Egyptian and Mesopotamian pantheons. The third type included divine pairs who were actually a single deity that had two names. Eblaites worshiped few Mesopotamian deities, preferring North-Western Semitic gods, some of which were unique to Ebla. The first genre of pairs included Nidakul, who was exclusive to Ebla, and his consort, Belatu ("his wife"); Rasap and his consort Adamma; the patron gods of the city Kura, who was unique to Ebla, and his consort Barama. The third genre included the artisan god Kamish/Tit, Kothar-wa-Khasis and the planet Venus represented by twin mountain Gods; Shahar as the morning star and Shalim as the evening star.|$|E
5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei, players {{take the}} role of an unnamed protagonist, a teenage boy who can {{communicate}} with demons using a computer program. The gameplay {{is similar to that of}} other games in the series: players make their way through dungeons and fight against demons in a first-person perspective. The protagonist uses a variety of weapons and items, with the primary weapons being swords and guns. Such items are bought from merchants scattered around the world map. In special areas, the protagonist can use the in-game currency to restore health and magic points for themselves and their demons, remove status ailments, and revive fallen demons. Special Terminals scattered across the world map allow the player to save their game, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> use them to teleport between terminals in different areas of Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|In the wild, the {{breeding}} season for Campbell's dwarf hamster varies by location. For example, {{the breeding}} season begins towards {{the middle of}} April in Tuva and {{towards the end of}} April in Mongolia. However, in captivity, there is no fixed breeding season <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> breed frequently throughout the year. Females are usually sexually mature at two months of age and the gestation period is typically 20 days. Campbell's dwarf hamster is crepuscular, along with all species of Phodopus and is active throughout the year. Campbell's dwarf hamsters are omnivores, and so feed on both plant and insect material. Campbell's dwarf hamster inhabits burrows with four to six horizontal and vertical tunnels in the steppes and semi deserts of central Asia, the Altai mountains, autonomous areas of Tuva and the Hebei province in northeastern China.|$|E
