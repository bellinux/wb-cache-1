For example, I do appreciate that lots of people worked long and hard putting together things like the DVD of the Sticky & Sweet Tour that we just released, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the finished product, but I have got no idea how people are going to find out about it or how it's going to be sold." ...|$|E
500|$|When Goebel's son, Paul G. Goebel, Jr., ran for Ford's Congressional seat in 1974, then President Ford {{returned}} to Grand Rapids {{to campaign for}} Goebel's son. Ford delivered a speech at Calvin College in Grand Rapids {{the week before the}} election in which he said: [...] "Paul Goebel I have known since he was just a lad. His dad knew me when I was back at South High—an inspired if not very competent football player. But I have known the Goebel family a long time, and they are strong and they are tall, and they are {{the kind of people who}} are dedicated to public service. Paul, Jr.'s, father was; Paul, Jr., himself is. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> nothing but the finest in that family, and young Paul, he epitomizes all the great characteristics of that family." ...|$|E
500|$|Painter Maqbool Fida Hussain {{found his}} muse in Madhuri Dixit after {{watching}} the part of Hum Aapke Hai Koun...! where [...] "Didi Tera Devar Deewana" [...] is performed. He went on to watch the film 67 times. About Dixit's dance in the song Hussain confessed, [...] "That movement of the hips is out of this world. I have {{never seen such a}} dancer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the best. Her words are transformed into body language." [...] He painted a series of paintings inspired from Dixit. Madhuri as Menaka with Vishwamitra, Madhuri as Radha with Nand Lala, Madhuri playing tennis at Wimbledon were some of those paintings. The Menaka painting was inspired from the famous painting of apsara Menaka as painted by Raja Ravi Verma. Another painting also showed Dixit with Meryl Streep leaning over a bridge in Madison County and Clint Eastwood on horseback below. The painting Nautanki showed Dixit with a backless blouse turning behind like the step in [...] "Didi Tera Devar Deewana", however this time sporting a nine yards Maharashtrian saree.|$|E

500|$|Still, {{the film}} {{received}} mixed praise from trade publications. The Mirror commended the film for the clever adaptation which preserved coherency in the story, the good acting and adequate costuming despite a few {{flaws in the}} production. Among the errors highlighted by the Mirror was Eliza's ice scene and another scene where the black actors wore inaccurate attire such as a laborer who wore a fine shirt and tie. The Morning Telegraph reviewer did not care for the production much, finding issues with the adaptation, the acting and the scenes. The Moving Picture News was more positive in its review, praising the photography and the sensible adaptation of the book to the film format. Three different reviews in The Moving Picture World were published, each of which were positive. In contrast to the fault found in the Mirror, one of the reviewers specifically praised the ice scene by stating, [...] "This {{part of the picture}} seems to have been conceived and carried out with extraordinary realism. You see the snow falling, the ice floes cracking and moving, you felt the danger that the woman and child were running as they made their escape across the ice, pursued by their remorseless enemy through the blinding snowstorm. This is one of the finest effects I have seen on the moving picture screen, and the whole story, so far as I have seen it, is worked out with wonderful realism, effect and verisimilitude. It's as good a rendering of the subject as I have ever seen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> Uncle Tom's Cabin played several times." [...] The Leavenworth Times of Leavenworth, Kansas had an article reviewing the production and offered much praise for adaptation.|$|E

But the conclusions of this report are absolutely clear. There is no doubt, there is nothing equivocal, there are no ambiguities.

In this manner it goes away, lessening the stream for above a mile, near two, and these they call the Swallows.|$|E

2500|$|The prison {{has come}} under far less scorn than {{comparable}} facilities at the state level, which tend to suffer heavily from overpopulation, low staff-to-inmate ratios and security issues inherent to attempting to enforce a supermax system in a non-purpose-built facility. Jamie Fellner of Human Rights Watch said after {{a tour of the}} facility, [...] "The Bureau of Prisons has taken a harsh punitive model and implemented it as well as anybody I know." [...] Notorious escape artist Richard Lee McNair wrote to a journalist from his cell in 2009 to say [...] "Thank God for prisons [...] There are some very sick people in here... Animals you would never want living near your family or the public in general. I don't know how corrections staff deal with it.

2500|$|In the Second Presidential Address {{to members}} of the Geological Society in 1953, Lees {{described}} his vision of the wonders of geology: [...] "I have sat in contemplation on the Kerry rocks of south-western Ireland and seen the great Hercynian ranges warping downwards through a magnificent fiord phase of drowned valleys into the water of the Atlantic; I have observed with awe and wonder the inspiring view of the Armorican ranges confidently striking into the turbulent Atlantic at the Point du Raz, Finistère, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the great Atlas Mountains with their component subdivisions heading strongly seaward; I have seen the Arabian and Indian coasts, made a complete circuit of Australia and traversed the Pacific; I have seen the Californian edge of the American continent and the great drowned valleys of the British Columbian coasts; I have seen the bevelled stumps of the one time mountains of Nova Scotia striking freely into the Atlantic and I have traversed the eastern seaboard of the United States to the point of Florida and the Antilles loop to Trinidad and into Venezuela." ...|$|E
