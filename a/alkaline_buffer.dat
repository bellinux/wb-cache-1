Washing can also relax brittle or distorted paper and aid in flattening. When washing alone does not combat acidity, the addition of an <b>alkaline</b> <b>buffer</b> to paper is sometimes recommended for de-acidification.

50|$|For buffers in acid regions, the pH may be {{adjusted}} to a desired value by adding a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid to the buffering agent. For alkaline buffers, a strong base such as sodium hydroxide may be added. Alternatively, a buffer mixture {{can be made from}} a mixture of an acid and its conjugate base. For example, an acetate buffer can be made from a mixture of acetic acid and sodium acetate. Similarly an <b>alkaline</b> <b>buffer</b> can be made from a mixture of the base and its conjugate acid.|$|E

Erythrocytes of {{other kinds of}} animals that have been tested are {{relatively}} or completely insensitive, or {{the results have been}} equivocal. Several parameters of the hemagglutination (HA) test—such as the temperature of incubation, the species of erythrocyte used, {{and in the case of}} chicken erythrocytes the genetic composition and age of the donor—may quantitatively affect results. The HA test is most commonly conducted at room temperature, at approximately neutral pH, and with guinea pig erythrocytes. Higher HA titers have been recorded when the diluent used in the test was veronal buffer rather than phosphate-buffered saline.

30|$|The paper recounts how buffers {{affect the}} {{physical}} and mechanical properties of gypsum particleboard (GPB) and the initial curing time (IC) of gypsum. The acidic buffers were better than <b>alkaline</b> <b>buffers</b> for prolonging the IC of gypsum and affecting the properties of GPB. Weak acids were advantageous for curing gypsum. When suitable amounts of citric acid and trisodium citrate were added, high performances could be achieved and the IC of gypsum could be prolonged to about 2 h. When <b>alkaline</b> <b>buffers</b> such as sodium carbonate were added, the 1 C of gypsum was still short but the internal bond strength (IB), modulus of elasticity (MOE), and modulus of rupture (MOR) of GPB were obviously decreased. Citric acid was the best among the four buffers used; and the GPB had a good IB, MOE, MOR, and adequate IC when citric acid of ≤ 0.1 % was added. Sodium carbonate was not suitable owing to low performance and short IC. Gypsum curing is an endothermic reaction.|$|R

As with any photographic print, mordançage prints are degraded by exposure to light, humidity, and high temperatures. The mordançage solution is acidic, so these prints can contaminate other materials. Photographs can be interleaved with <b>alkaline</b> <b>buffered</b> paper, or sleeved in polyethylene to help prevent acid migration.|$|R
40|$|Various {{types of}} rubella complement-fixing (CF) antigen {{preparations}} derived from infected BHK- 21 cell cultures were examined for stability to certain chemical and physical agents.

All preparations were stable at - 20 C for months, and were unaffected by three cycles of freezing and thawing. Ether treatment rendered antigens highly susceptible to thermal inactivation at 56 C; untreated antigens were inactivated slowly and showed a persistent fraction of activity even after 2 hr. Large-particle antigen {{was found to}} be slightly more susceptible than small-particle antigen to thermal inactivation and ether treatment.

The most labile compound, 1 -(5 -aminopentanoyl) guanidine, decomposed with a half life of 19 s to yield piperidin- 2 -one (pH 10. 4 at 25 °C).

40|$|Suspensions of {{isolated}} cell envelopes of infectious elementary bodies (EB) of Chlamydia psittaci at alkaline pH showed a rapid, extensive decrease in absorbance, {{accompanied by the}} release of a cell envelope component in a sedimentable form. This phenomenon was observed both at 0 C and with envelopes which had been previously heated to 100 C. Monovalent and divalent cations effectively inhibited the turbidity loss, whereas ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) caused an accelerated decrease in turbidity. The turbidity loss observed after incubation of the envelopes at alkaline pH could be reversed {{to the level of the}} initial value by dialysis against distilled water containing Mg 2 +. Thin-section electron photomicrographs of purified EB exposed to <b>alkaline</b> <b>buffer</b> with EDTA revealed the loss of the internal contents of cells, but these cells still maintained their round shapes. The cell surface of treated EB appeared pitted in negatively stained preparations, whereas intact EB had a smooth surface.

40|$|The {{production}} of short anticancer peptides in recombinant form {{is an alternative}} method for costly chemical manufacturing. However, the limitations of host toxicity, bioactivity and column purification have impaired production in mass quantities. In this study, short cationic peptides were produced in aggregated inclusion bodies by double fusion with a central pro-tein that has anti-cancer activity. The anticancer peptides Tachiplicin I (TACH) and Latarcin 1 (LATA) were fused with the N- and C-terminus of the MAP 30 protein, respectively. We successfully produced the recombinant TACH-MAP 30 -LATA protein and MAP 30 alone in E. coli that represented 59 % and 68 % of the inclusion bodies.
