40|$|Research {{across many}} {{countries}} reports that teaching the key ideas of proof <b>and</b> <b>proving</b> {{to all students}} {{is not an easy}} task. This paper reports on the session of the BSRLM Geometry Working Group which examined current classroom material from the UK with the intention of uncovering the ‘opportunities for proof’ in geometry that are provided by such material. To carry out such an analysis three analytical frameworks are compared. Two of the analytical frameworks, while placing proof <b>and</b> <b>proving</b> in a wider context of learners’ mathematics, may not fully uncover the detail of proof <b>and</b> <b>proving.</b> The third analytical framework, while permitting a detailed analysis of explicit proof <b>and</b> <b>proving,</b> may not fully account for textbooks that devote most space to discussions of proof <b>and</b> <b>proving</b> and/or contain problems that implicitly provoke proof. This comparison reveals some of the complexity of textbook analysis and suggests that further work is needed on a suitable analytical framework...|$|R
5|$|Bardanes's revolt {{temporarily}} weakened Byzantium, {{especially in}} its capability {{to deal with}} the Arab threat to the East, but Qasim's invasion was of limited scope, and his father's far larger intervention shortly after also resulted in no major military confrontations: Harun withdrew after a truce was concluded in exchange for a modest sum. Thus the revolt did not seriously affect the army or most of Anatolia. Nevertheless, it is indicative of the soldiers' dissatisfaction with Nikephoros, which would surface again in subsequent years <b>and</b> <b>prove</b> a constant source of trouble throughout his reign.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{a serial}} format {{known as the}} roman-feuilleton was highly popular in France, and the most {{acclaimed}} expression of it was the socialist writing of Eugène Sue. Balzac wanted to challenge Sue's supremacy, <b>and</b> <b>prove</b> himself the most capable feuilleton author in France. Writing quickly and with intense focus, Balzac produced La Cousine Bette, one of his longest novels, in two months. It was published in Le Constitutionnel {{at the end of}} 1846, then collected with a companion work, Le Cousin Pons, the following year.|$|E
5|$|The deities' ongoing battles prompt {{an alien}} race called the Aurum to invade Earth for its resources. In response, the warring deities strike a brief ceasefire and unite {{alongside}} the self-proclaimed Sun God Pyrrhon {{in order to}} fight the Aurum. However, Pyrrhon betrays the deities due to wanting to claim the Aurum's power <b>and</b> <b>prove</b> himself as the strongest god in existence, which leads to him being mentally controlled by the Aurum Brain. After Pit defeats the fusion of Pyrrhon and the Aurum Brain, Pyrrhon briefly comes to his senses and sacrifices himself to banish the Aurum {{to the far side}} of the galaxy.|$|E

In this research, the prospective teachers’ proof perceptions, the effect of proof perceptions to the process of proving; whether their attitudes towards proof <b>and</b> <b>proving</b> differentiate concerning their proof perceptions were studied. It was found that the types of proof perceptions of the prospective teachers had an effect on the process of <b>proving</b> <b>and</b> their attitudes towards proof <b>and</b> <b>proving</b> could change concerning their proof perception.

In 2017, Xu et al.

In 2017, Guan et al.
