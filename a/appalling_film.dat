5000|$|Since its {{original}} release, the critical {{response to the}} film has continued to be mostly positive. Bill Warren has written that the film was [...] "the best and most significant science fiction movie of 1955â€¦it remains a decent, competent example of any era's science fiction output.." [...] In Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Science Fiction, the film was described as [...] "a full-blooded space opera complete with interplanetary warfare and bug-eyed monsters ... the film's space operatics are given a dreamlike quality and a moral dimension that makes the dramatic situation far more interesting." [...] Danny Peary felt the film was [...] "colorful, imaginative, gadget-laden sci-fi." [...] At the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 71%, based upon 14 reviews. Greater Milwaukee Today described it as [...] "An <b>appalling</b> <b>film</b> ..." ...|$|E
50|$|A 2004 film adaptation, Blueberry(U.S. release {{title is}} Renegade), was {{directed}} by Jan Kounen and starred Vincent Cassel in the lead role, with Giraud himself making a walk-on cameo appearance in the movie. Many purists were <b>appalled</b> by this <b>film.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Allmovie {{writes of}} the film, [...] "Well-directed and convincingly played, the film manages {{to walk the}} fine line between the nauseating {{misogyny}} of Japan's <b>appalling</b> 'turtle girl' <b>films</b> and the outright silliness of American and British 'pony girl' efforts, presenting a reasonable introduction to the oft-misunderstood world of erotic discipline." ...|$|R
5000|$|Also in the sixties, {{he tried}} {{his hand at}} acting with a cameo role in the film [...] "2001, a Space Odyssey", where he played one of the apes {{surrounding}} the black obelisk {{at the start of}} the <b>film.</b> <b>Appalled</b> by the violence in the later [...] "enlightened ape" [...] scene, he stormed off the set, ending his acting career.|$|R
5000|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} 8.5 Hours was overwhelmingly negative. On its cinema release in Ireland, the film received a harsh review from The Irish Independent which appeared <b>appalled</b> by the <b>film's</b> {{depiction of the}} Dublin middle class behaving badly, and wrote that the film was [...] "poisonous {{to the cause of}} Irish tourism". The Irish Times listed the film among the 10 worst of 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Steven Spielberg had {{developed}} {{the story of}} a flyer with a young son, containing themes that interested him: aircraft and flying and parental responsibility. Spielberg expected to be the screenwriter and director. However, the executives who had bought the story left the studio. and the new executive turned the story over to another writer and another director. Spielberg was so <b>appalled</b> by the <b>film</b> that he publicly complained it had been [...] "turned into a really sick film. They should bury it." [...] Spielberg would not make a film for Twentieth Century Fox until 2002's Minority Report (even then, this was a co-production with DreamWorks).|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{was one of}} the film's admirers {{and gave}} the film three stars out of four, stating on his website [...] "I know some {{audience}} members will be <b>appalled</b> by this <b>film,</b> as many were by Seven. It is a very hard R that would doubtless have been NC-17 if it had come from an indie instead of a big studio with clout. But it is a real film. Not a slick exploitation exercise with all the trappings of depravity but none of the consequences. Not a film where moral issues are forgotten in the excitement of an action climax. Yes, the hero is an ordinary man who finds himself able to handle violent situations, but that's not the movie's point. The last two words of the screenplay are [...] "save me" [...] and by the time they're said, we know what they mean." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fat Slags {{received}} near unanimously negative {{reviews and}} was widely panned by critics. The Sun said [...] "There {{may still be}} some diehard Viz aficionados who'll love every second of this film - but I'm one and I didn't," [...] while The Guardian stated [...] "It has plenty of gross-out stuff, but chucked in with an eerie lack of enjoyment or conviction. Depression seeps out of the screen like carbon monoxide." [...] Graham Dury stated that Rita, Sue and Bob Too was a more accurate live action depiction of the comic book characters. It was also claimed he was so <b>appalled</b> by the <b>film,</b> that he stopped drawing the strips and it was dropped from Viz though that proved unfounded as the strip was never dropped. British film historian I.Q. Hunter, discussing the question [...] "What is the worst British film ever made?",listed Fat Slags {{as one of the}} contenders for that title.|$|R
500|$|While {{working on}} {{promotions}} for Band Baaja Baaraat, Chopra realised {{that she wanted}} to become an actress and decided to resign from her executive position with Yash Raj Films to attend acting school. Film director Maneesh Sharma suggested signing Chopra to Aditya Chopra, chairman of Yash Raj <b>Films.</b> <b>Appalled</b> by the idea of recruiting someone from his marketing team as an actress, the vice-president refused. When Parineeti Chopra told Sharma she was leaving her job to attend acting school he advised her to meet the company's casting director, who asked her to do a [...] "dummy audition for fun". Chopra remembered [...] "fooling around with a camera" [...] and delivering lines by the character Geet from the film Jab We Met, never expecting producer Aditya Chopra to see the tape. However, when the producer saw the tape he was impressed with her acting. With Sharma describing her [...] "phenomenal" [...] in the screen test, Chopra was signed to a three-film deal; Chopra's colleagues later told her she was a [...] "misfit in an office situation".|$|R
50|$|Jor-El {{is shown}} here {{to have been}} mentored by friend and noted {{scientist}} Non, who corroborated Jor-El's findings regarding Krypton's impending destruction, when the two were arrested and brought to trial before the Council by Zod and Ursa. When Non defies the Council's dire prohibitions and elects {{to spread the word}} of the coming apocalypse, he is abducted by Council agents and apparently lobotomized, thus explaining the character's mute simple-mindedness, brutality and destructiveness in line with Jack O'Halloran's performance as Non in the first two Reeve <b>films.</b> <b>Appalled,</b> Zod and Ursa propose to Jor-El that they band together and overthrow the Council, but Jor-El will have none of it. When their murderous insurrection fails, the Council forces Jor-El to exile them to the Phantom Zone and never speak of his findings again, lest he face the same fate. For this perceived betrayal, Zod declares that he will escape and conquer Krypton (confident that Jor-El will actually discover some way to save the planet) and force the scientist and his son to kneel before him one day.|$|R
