40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{electronic}} structure and the adsorption of nitric oxide (NO) on various metal phthalocyanines (MPc, M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn). By fully optimized geometries and electronic structure of various MPcs, {{we found that the}} 3 d states of metals mainly contributed to ground-state electronic structure near the Fermi level of MPc and, to some degree, the p states of carbon inner ring. Those contribution of 3 d states decreases as we move <b>across</b> <b>the</b> periodic <b>table</b> <b>from</b> Mn to Zn following the increase of d orbital occupancies. We also found that NO strongly bonds to the centre metal with end-on configuration and results in an opening of HOMO-LUMO energy gap in case of MnPc, FePc, and CoPc. While it shows a physisorption with other MPcs (Ni, Cu, and Zn) and results in an appearance of molecular electronic states at HOMO-LUMO gap...|$|R
60|$|And {{presently}} Carley {{found herself}} seated <b>across</b> <b>the</b> crude <b>table</b> <b>from</b> Glenn, with <b>the</b> background of chinked logs in her sight, and the smart of wood smoke in her eyes. In years past she had sat {{with him in}} the soft, subdued, gold-green shadows of the Astor, or in the sumptuous atmosphere of the St. Regis. But this event was so different, so striking, that she felt it would have limitless significance. For one thing, the look of Glenn! When had he ever seemed like this, wonderfully happy to have her there, consciously proud of this dinner he had prepared in half an hour, strangely studying her as one on trial? This might have had its effect upon Carley's reaction to the situation, making it sweet, trenchant with meaning, but she was hungry enough and the dinner was good enough to make this hour memorable on that score alone. She ate until she was actually ashamed of herself. She laughed heartily, she talked, she made love to Glenn. Then suddenly an idea flashed into her quick mind.|$|R

50|$|As we move left <b>across</b> <b>the</b> {{periodic}} <b>table</b> (e.g. <b>from</b> copper to iron), {{we create}} additional {{holes in the}} metal 3d orbitals. For example, a low-spin ferric (FeIII) system in an octahedral environment has a ground state of (t2g)5(eg)0 resulting in transitions to the t2g (dπ) and eg (dσ) sets. Therefore, there are two possible final states: t2g6eg0 or t2g5eg1(Figure 2a). Since the ground-state metal configuration has four holes in the eg orbital set and one hole in the t2g orbital set, an intensity ratio of 4:1 might be expected (Figure 2b). However, this model {{does not take into}} account covalent bonding and, indeed, an intensity ratio of 4:1 is not observed in the spectrum.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} a novel route for {{the synthesis of}} nanostructured transition metal arsenides including those of FeAs, CoAs, MnAs, and CrAs through a generalized protocol. The key feature of the method {{is the use of}} one-step hot-injection and the clever use of a combination of precursors which are low-melting and highly reactive such as metal carbonyls and triphenylarsine in a solventless setup. This method also facilitates the formation of one-dimensional nanostructures as we move <b>across</b> <b>the</b> periodic <b>table</b> <b>from</b> CrAs to CoAs. The chemical basis of this reaction is simple redox chemistry between the transition metals, wherein the transition metal is oxidized from elemental state (E 0) to E 3 +in lieu of reduction of As 3 + to As 3 −. While the thermodynamic analysis reveals that all these conversions are spontaneous, it is the kinetics of the process that influences morphology of the product nanostructures, which varies from extremely small nanoparticles to nanorods. Transition metal pnictides show interesting magnetic properties and these nanostructures can serve as model systems for the exploration of their intricate magnetism as well as their applications and can also function as starting materials for the arsenide based nanosuperconductors...|$|R
2500|$|The diminished {{metallic}} {{nature of}} the post-transition metals is largely attributable {{to the increase in}} nuclear charge going <b>across</b> <b>the</b> periodic <b>table,</b> <b>from</b> left to right. [...] The increase in nuclear charge is partially offset by an increasing number of electrons but as these are spatially distributed each extra electron does not fully screen each successive increase in nuclear charge, and the latter therefore dominates. With some irregularities, atomic radii contract, ionisation energies increase, fewer electrons become available for metallic bonding, and [...] "ions [...] smaller and more polarizing and more prone to covalency." [...] This phenomenon is more evident in period 4–6 post-transition metals, due to inefficient screening of their nuclear charges by their d10 and (in the case of the period 6 metals) f14 electron configurations; the screening power of electrons decreases in the sequence s > p > d > f. The reductions in atomic size due to the interjection of the d- and f-blocks are referred to as, respectively, the 'scandide' or 'd-block contraction', and the 'lanthanide contraction'. Relativistic effects also [...] "increase the binding energy", and hence ionisation energy, of the electrons in [...] "the 6s shell in gold and mercury, and the 6p shell in subsequent elements of period 6." ...|$|R

60|$|The evening {{had been}} a {{pleasant}} one. Ellen, {{who had not been}} to a party for years, found it very pleasant. All the guests had been members of her old set and there was no intrusive youth to spoil the flavour, for the only son of the bride and groom was far away at college and could not be present. Norman Douglas had been there and they had met socially {{for the first time in}} years, though she had seen him once or twice in church that winter. Not the least sentiment was awakened in Ellen's heart by their meeting. She was accustomed to wonder, when she thought about it at all, how she could ever have fancied him or felt so badly over his sudden marriage. But she had rather liked meeting him again. She had forgotten how bracing and stimulating he could be. No gathering was ever stagnant when Norman Douglas was present. Everybody had been surprised when Norman came. It was well known he never went anywhere. The Pollocks had invited him because he had been one of the original guests, but they never thought he would come. He had taken his second cousin, Amy Annetta Douglas, out to supper and seemed rather attentive to her. But Ellen sat <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>from</b> him and had a spirited argument with him--an argument during which all his shouting and banter could not fluster her and in which she came off best, flooring Norman so composedly and so completely that he was silent for ten minutes. At the end of which time he had muttered in his ruddy beard--"spunky as ever--spunky as ever"--and began to hector Amy Annetta, who giggled foolishly over his sallies where Ellen would have retorted bitingly.|$|E
60|$|An Englishman <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{relieved}} Colville <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{difficulty of}} answering this question by asking him another that formed {{talk about it}} between them. He made his tacit observation that the English, since he met them last, seemed to have grown in the grace of facile speech with strangers; it was the American family which kept its talk within itself, and hushed to a tone so low {{that no one else}} could hear it. Colville did not like their mumbling; for the honour of the country, which we all have at heart, however little we think it, he would have preferred that they should speak up, and not seem afraid or ashamed; he thought the English manner was better. In fact, he found himself in an unexpectedly social mood; he joined in helping to break the ice; he laughed and hazarded comment with those who were new-comers like himself, and was very respectful of the opinions of people who had been longer in the hotel, when they spoke of the cook's habit of underdoing the vegetables. The dinner at the Hotel d'Atene made an imposing show on the carte du jour; it looked like ten or twelve courses, but in fact it was five, and even when eked out with roast chestnuts and butter into six, it seemed somehow to stop very abruptly, though one seemed to have had enough. You could have coffee afterward if you ordered it. Colville ordered it, and was sorry when the last of his commensals, slightly bowing him a good-night, left him alone to it.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{detailed}} {{report of the}} structural investigations of some new radicals formed in 8 -irradiated inorganic solids. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy is used for such studies {{as it is a}} very sensitive tool for identification of radicals, A great deal of information was obtained from the electron spin resonance spectra about the structure of the radicals, especially with respect to the delocalisation of the unpaired electron within the radicals, the shape of the species, possible internal motions, and the role of electronegativity of the constituent atoms; upon these the effect of environment may be impressed as a perturbation. As a part of a continuing study of the structures of twenty five-valence electron oxy-radicals of general type AOsn-, the radical BrOs in 8 -irradiated KBrO 3 is discussed in Chapter II, This pyramidal radical is found (from its p:s ratio) to be considerably flatter than its parent ion, BrO 3 -. In Chapter III, the species PO 3 F-, PO 2 F 2 and PO 2 F- and also PO 42 -, PO 32 - are discussed, The hyperfine interaction with fluorine substituents in phosphates, shows the mechanism of spin transfer from the central to the ligand atoms. Chapter IV describes the new radicals POCls-, PO 2 Cl 2, POCl 2 and also PC 1, PCl 2. The species are compared with corresponding known fluoro species. Chapter V deals with the species PR 3 +, AIR 3 - and also SiR 3, where R is H or alkyl. The 3 p : 3 s ratio shows that these species are pyramidal in character but this ratio increases markedly on going from aluminium to phosphorus. This suggests that these isostructural radicals flatten in this order, thus depicting the role of electro-negativity in governing the shape of radicals- This trend is found more prominent for the alkyls than for the hydrides. Radicals of general type RaC-X, where R is H or alkyl and X is alkyl substituted A 1 or P have been studied in different systems and are discussed in Chapter VI. It is concluded that the spin is transmitted to the group X by spin polarisation of the C - X 6 bond and the value of Aiso is negative. A clear trend to lower magnitude is observed in the s character on going <b>across</b> <b>the</b> periodic <b>table</b> <b>from</b> aluminium to phosphorus. Chapter VII describes the formation of radicals CH 3 and H 2 COP(O) (OMe) 2 in 8 -irradiated frozen trimethyl phosphate. Nothing new could be said about the rotating radical CH 3 which is universally accepted as being plannar. The latter radical has an e. s. r. spectrum characteristic of radicals in which the-hydrogen atoms are rapidly reorienting. The small phosphorus splitting is explained in terms of structures where two rival mechanisms, conjugation and hyperconjugation are active. The spectra from trapped N-atoms in irradiated sodium and potassium azide are explained in terms of the zero field splitting from D and E in Chapter VIII. In both cases clear temperature effects were noticed, being more marked in the case of sodium azide where the spectrum shows a reversible change between non-axial and axial symmetry. A possible explanation is given for this, and the zero field splitting is explained in terms of slight admixture of the nitrogen 2 s orbitals into the 4 S ground state of the atoms...|$|R
