40|$|Recent {{advances}} in click modeling have established {{it as an}} attractive approach to interpret search click data. These advances characterize users ’ search behavior either in advertisement blocks, or within an organic search block through probabilistic models. Yet, when searching for information on a search result page, one is often interacting with the search engine via an entire page instead of a single block. Consequently, previous works that exclusively modeled user behavior in a single block may sacrifice much useful user behavior information embedded in other blocks. To solve this problem, in this paper, we put forward a novel Whole Page Click (WPC) Model to characterize user behavior in multiple blocks. Specifically, WPC uses a Markov chain to learn the user transition probabilities among different blocks in the whole page. To compare our model with the best alternatives in the Web-Search literature, we run a largescale experiment on a real dataset and demonstrate {{the advantage of the}} WPC model in terms of both the whole page and each block in the page. Especially, we find that WPC can achieve significant gain in interpreting the advertisement data, despite of the sparsity of the <b>advertisement</b> <b>click</b> data...|$|E

In this paper, several machine learning algorithms including conditional random fields (CRF), support vector machines (SVM), decision tree (DT) and backpropagation neural networks (BPN) are developed to learn user’s <b>click</b> behaviors from <b>advertisement</b> search and <b>click</b> logs. In addition, four levels of features are extracted to represent user search and click intents. Given a user’s search session and a query, machine learning algorithms along with different features are proposed to predict if the user will <b>click</b> <b>advertisements</b> displayed for the query. We further study the impact of feature selection algorithms on the prediction models. Random subspace (RS), F-score (FS) and information gain (IG) are employed {{to search for a}} predictive subset of features.

Namely, a dishonest advertiser under-reports the transaction count in order to discharge less. In this paper, we present a mechanism to detect such a fraud using a hybrid of cryptography and probability tools. With the assistance from {{a small number of}} users, the publisher can detect deflation fraud with a success probability growing exponentially with the fraud amount, and can estimate the amount of frauds. Our scheme is amiable to both the advertiser and the users because the existing transaction model remains unchanged. It is also efficient and scalable as the incurred communication, computation and storage costs are independent of the number of transactions...|$|R

Mobile advertisement {{is a primary}} business model that offers the financial incentives for developers to distribute free applications. In the mobile advertisement market, advertising networks serve as a single vendor for advertisers and pay a developer according to the numbers of impressions (the number of times an advertisement has been served) and/or clicks generated by users [2]; application developers expect users to “pay” for their applications by viewing (i.e., impressions) or <b>clicking</b> <b>advertisements</b> (i.e., generating <b>clicks)</b> as many as possible.|$|R

Malicious entities exploit this spur in user-engagement levels to spread malicious content that compromises system reputation and degrades user experience. It also generates revenue from <b>advertisements,</b> <b>clicks,</b> etc. for the malicious entities. Facebook, the world's biggest social network, is no exception and has recently been reported to face much abuse through scams and other type of malicious content, especially during news making events. Recent studies have reported that spammers earn $ 200 million just by posting malicious links on Facebook. In this paper, we characterize malicious content posted on Facebook during 17 events, and discover that existing efforts to counter malicious content by Facebook {{are not able to}} stop all malicious content from entering the social graph. Our findings revealed that malicious entities tend to post content through web and third party applications while legitimate entities prefer mobile platforms to post content. In addition, we discovered a substantial amount of malicious content generated by Facebook pages. Through our observations, we propose an extensive feature set based on entity profile, textual content, metadata, and URL features to identify malicious content on Facebook in real time and at zero-hour. This feature set was used to train multiple machine learning models and achieved an accuracy of 86. 9 %. The intent is to catch malicious content that is currently evading Facebook's detection techniques. Our machine learning model was able to detect more than double the number of malicious posts as compared to existing malicious content detection techniques.

We show how this factorization can be seamlessly combined with explicit features or side-information for pages and ads, which let us combine the benefits of both approaches.

40|$|MSc (Environmental Sciences), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Acoustic {{communication}} in anurans plays {{a critical role}} in species recognition, defending territories and resources, and finding a mate. Anurans use a number of different call note types to communicate, from which the most notable are advertisement- and aggression calls. Optimum weather conditions are a precursor to the commencement of the breeding season for all frog species and their calling behaviour is therefore readily influenced by atmospheric conditions. Male frogs within a chorus also tend to call from territories within a specific range of distances from one another. The objectives of this study were to 1) determine a possible context in which call note types are produced, 2) to determine the effect of atmospheric conditions on calling behaviour and 3) to determine the spacing distances between males and females in a chorus of Queckett’s River Frog (Amietia quecketti). Pre-recorded note types were used in a playback experiment to determine a context for elicited responses. A context was derived for six of the responses. <b>Advertisement</b> (<b>clicks</b> and whines), aggression (creaks), encounter (tonal notes), territorial (whine-tonal notes), and release calls (squeaks) were described. Calls and atmospheric conditions were recorded and correlated for an entire breeding season. Water temperature, wind speed, humidity and barometric pressure had a significant effect on calling intensity. As water temperature decreased calling intensity increased, while increased wind temperature led to increased calling intensity. Amietia quecketti calls from the water, explaining the effect while increased wind speed decreases water temperature and can carry sound further. Both humidity and barometric pressure showed increased calling intensity only at specific levels. Humidity and barometric pressure have a direct effect on one another, which most likely causes the correlation between calling intensity and both these variables. In this study A. quecketti was shown to have breeding ponds for males and resting ponds and positions for non-gravid females. This prevents unwanted or unnecessary amplexus. Males showed much smaller and less variable territory sizes than females. This is most likely because males have a small range of optimal spacing distance while females move towards and away from males. The presence of vegetation resulted in smaller territories. This is possibly because smaller males act as satellite males and cannot be seen by larger males in vegetation. The size of males did not affect territory size. Males have a specific inter-male spacing distance regardless of size. Master...|$|R

However, the two posted price benchmarks (and therefore the revenue guarantees from the corresponding random sampling auctions) can each be larger than the other; further, which is the larger cannot be determined without knowing the private values of the advertisers. We design a new auction, that incorporates these two random sampling auctions, with the following property: the auction has a Nash equilibrium; and every equilibrium has revenue at least the larger of the revenues raised by running each of the two auctions individually (assuming bidders bid truthfully when doing so is a utility maximizing strategy). Finally, we perform simulations which indicate that the revenue from our auction outperforms that from the VCG auction in less competitive markets. 1...|$|R

40|$|Predicting the {{click-through}} rate of an advertisement {{is a critical}} component of online advertising platforms. In sponsored search, the {{click-through rate}} estimates the probability that a displayed <b>advertisement</b> is <b>clicked</b> by a user after she submits a query to the search engine. Commercial search engines typically rely on machine learning models trained with a large number of features to make such predictions. This is inevitably requires a lot of engineering efforts to define, compute, and select the appropriate features. In this paper, we propose two novel approaches (one working at character level and the other working at word level) that use deep convolutional neural networks to predict the click-through rate of a query-advertisement pair. Specially, the proposed architectures only consider the textual content appearing in a query-advertisement pair as input, and produce as output a click-through rate prediction. By comparing the character-level model with the word-level model, we show that language representation can be learnt from scratch at character level when trained on enough data. Through extensive experiments using billions of query-advertisement pairs of a popular commercial search engine, we demonstrate that both approaches significantly outperform a baseline model built on well-selected text features and a state-of-the-art word 2 vec-based approach. Finally, by combining the predictions of the deep models introduced in this study with the prediction of the model in production of the same commercial search engine, we significantly improve the accuracy and the calibration of the click-through rate prediction of the production system.

Google {{is one of the few}} {{technology}} companies which continue to have one of the fastest growth rates in the world.

Google’s achievements absolutely do not come from any luck. Google has made extra efforts in creating an index of a number of websites, which have been up to 25 billion websites. This also includes 17 million images and one billion messages to Usenet group (Downes 2007). Besides searching for websites, Google users are able to search for PDF files, PostScript, documents, as well as Microsoft, Lotus, PowerPoint and Shockwave files. Google processes nearly 50 % of search queries all over the world. Moreover, it is the number one search option for web users and is one of the top five websites on the Internet, which have more than 380 million users and 28 billion visits every month, and more than 50 % of access from countries outside the US (Desjardins 2017). Google’s technology is rather special: it can analyze millions of different variables of users and businesses who place advertisements. It then connects them with millions of potential advertisements and gives messages of advertisement, which is closest to objects in less than one second. Thus, Google has the higher rate of users <b>clicking</b> <b>advertisements</b> than its opponent Yahoo, from 50 to 100 %, and it dominates over 70 % market share of paid advertisements (Rosenberg 2016). Google’s self-stated mission: “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful (Alves n.d.).” Nowadays, it is believed that people in the world like “Google” with words “the useful-lively information storage”.|$|R
