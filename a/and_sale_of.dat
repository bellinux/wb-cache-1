He also expanded employee benefits to same-sex partners of city workers, and advocated for gun control.

5|$|Burger's Daughter is a {{political}} and historical novel by the South African Nobel Prize in Literature-winner Nadine Gordimer, first published in the United Kingdom in June 1979 by Jonathan Cape. The book {{was expected to be}} banned in South Africa, and a month after publication in London the import <b>and</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> the book in South Africa was prohibited by the Publications Control Board. Three months later, the Publications Appeal Board overturned the banning and the restrictions were lifted.|$|E
5|$|Hire-purchase {{agreements}} are also regulated by this Act. The provisions {{are very similar}} to those for sale of goods agreements, with the section on exclusion clauses identical. Under the 1893 Act, conditional sale agreements (where the buyer takes possession of the goods, but the seller retains the right to repossess them) were treated as hire-purchase agreements, despite being fundamentally sales. With the unification of provisions for hire-purchase <b>and</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> goods agreements, conditional sale {{agreements are}} now treated as sales.|$|E
5|$|In the 1820s however, Tucker's {{views of}} slavery changed notably with {{personal}} experience, and profit, realized in his purchase <b>and</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> slaves for his account {{and that of}} his father-in-law, Charles Carter. For years he opposed the concepts of abolition and colonization as impractical, then finally reverted to his earlier conclusion that a more beneficial, commercially oriented, society was inevitable. Though he recounted the insipid benefits of slavery, he predicted its eventual death. Indeed, he freed his own slaves in 1845, 16 years prior to his death.|$|E

5|$|In the United States and the European Union, {{since the}} early 1990s {{regulations}} {{have been in place}} that are designed to prevent shellfish from contaminated waters entering the food chain. This has meant that there is sometimes a shortage of regulated shellfish, with consequent higher prices. This has led to illegal harvesting <b>and</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> shellfish on the black market, which can be a health hazard.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{legislative}} session of Bradley's term, 75 bills were filed, including {{a ban on}} the manufacture <b>and</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> cigarettes, a measure to make carrying a concealed weapon a felony, and a bill banning gambling at racetracks and church fairs. Competing measures affecting pool halls were introduced – one would have lifted most of the restrictions on their operation while another would have banned them altogether. Bradley added an anti-lynching law to the legislative agenda. However, none of these bills were acted on; {{the vast majority of the}} Assembly's attention during the session was focused on the election of a U.S. Senator.|$|E

When Beluche returned to Colombia, he published an article critical {{of the situation in}} the press.

5|$|Media exposés {{and popular}} outrage led Congress {{to pass by}} {{unanimous}} vote the Sexual Exploitation of Children Act of 1977, which criminalized the production <b>and</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> child porn. This act {{was signed into law}} by President Jimmy Carter on February 6, 1978. The legislation was supported by a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court in New York v. Ferber, , that images of children need not meet legal definitions of obscenity to be prohibited by the government, since the state's interest in protecting children from harm trumped First Amendment rights in this instance.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} bat's {{discovery}} in the 1970s, some roosting sites became disturbed {{as a result}} of tourism, scientific collection, and even the collection <b>and</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> individuals as souvenirs. However, these pressures may not have had a significant effect on the species as a whole, since many small colonies exist in hard-to-access locations, and only a few major caves were disturbed. Another potential risk is the activity of local monks, who have occupied roost caves during periods of meditation.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, on December 20, 1902, Flournoy, Price, {{and their}} law partner Smith were also incorporators of the White Oak Mining Company {{and of the}} West Construction Company. With an authorized capital stock of $100,000, the White Oak Mining Company, that was engaged in the mining, shipment, <b>and</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> coal, the cutting and sawing of timber, and the operations and sales of railway, telephone, and telegraph lines and networks. The West Construction Company, based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, was a general contracting and construction firm also involved in the operation and maintenance of railway, telephone, and telegraph lines.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} factor that negatively affects maintenance is the low and irregular pay that soldiers receive, resulting in the theft <b>and</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> spare parts and even basic equipment to supplement their meager salaries. When not stealing spare parts and equipment, maintenance personnel often spend {{the better part of}} their duty day looking for other ways to profit. American maintenance teams working in Zaire found that providing a free lunch to the work force was a good, sometimes the only, technique to motivate personnel to work {{at least half of the}} duty day.|$|E

5|$|True to his prohibitionist stance, Beckham {{supported}} {{passage of}} the Eighteenth Amendment forbidding the import <b>and</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> alcohol in the United States. The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920.

The amendment failed on February 10, 1919, but passed on June 4, 1919. Beckham voted against it both times.|$|E
5|$|As of November 2014, 28 {{states have}} enacted medical {{marijuana}} laws, removed jail time {{for possession of}} small amounts of marijuana, and/or have legalized the possession, distribution, <b>and</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> marijuana outright. The factors which have led to this change are many, {{but some of them}} could include increased support from the medical community for legalization, viable regulatory systems modeled off of alcohol regulation, and the potential for state financial gains from decreased criminal justice costs and increased tax revenues. Although outright legalization for non-medical use of marijuana has only occurred in four states in the Union, in view of the movements in many states, it is possible that those states will not be alone for long.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, reform {{movements}} in the U.S. (the so-called Progressive movement) made most forms of gambling illegal in most communities. Gambling continued illegally in many places, though, creating new opportunities for criminal enterprises. The 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1919, outlawed the manufacture, transportation, importation, <b>and</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> alcoholic beverages and initiated the Prohibition era. The new law was widely unpopular, and bootlegging became rampant. Galveston's already lax social attitudes allowed this, as well as brothels and other illegal businesses, to blossom in the city. These institutions were so accepted that at one point, the city required health inspections for prostitutes {{to ensure the safety}} of their clients.|$|E
