40|$|Background In early 1990 s, Tanzania {{like other}} African countries, adopted health sector reform (HSR). The most {{strongly}} held centralisation system that informed {{the nature of}} services provision including health was, thus, disintegrated giving rise to decentralisation system. It was {{within the realm of}} HSR process, user fees were introduced in the health sector. Along with user fees, various types of health insurances, including the Community Health Fund (CHF), were introduced. While the country’s level of enrolment in the CHF is low, there are marked variations among districts. This paper highlights the role of decentralised health management and leadership practices in the uptake of the CHF in Tanzania. Methods A comparative exploratory case study of high and low performing districts was carried out. In-depth interviews were conducted with the members of the Council Health Service Board (CHSB), Council Health Management Team (CHMT), Health Facility Committees (HFCs), in-charges of health facilities, healthcare providers, and Community Development Officers (CDOs). Minutes of the meetings of the committees and district annual health plans and district <b>annual</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>reports</b> were also used to verify and triangulate the data. Thematic analysis was adopted to analyse the collected data. We employed both inductive and deductive (mixed coding) to arrive to the themes. Results There were no differences in the level of education and experience of the district health managers in the two study districts. Almost all district health managers responsible for the management of the CHF had attended some training on management and leadership. However, there were variations in the personal initiatives of the top-district health leaders, particularly the district health managers, the council health services board and local government officials. Similarly, there were differences in the supervision mechanisms, and incentives available for the health providers, HFCs and board members in the two study districts. Conclusion This paper adds to the stock of knowledge on CHFs functioning in Tanzania. By comparing the best practices with the worst practices, the paper contributes valuable insights on how CHF can be scaled up and maintained. The study clearly indicates that the performance of the community-based health financing largely depends on the personal initiatives of the top-district health leaders, particularly the district health managers and local government officials. This implies that the regional health management team (RHMT) and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) should strengthen supportive supervision mechanisms to the district health managers and health facilities. More important, there is need for the MoHSW to provide opportunities for the well performing districts to share good practices to other districts in order to increase uptake of the community-based health insurance...|$|R
40|$|Stable {{housing is}} {{imperative}} {{for the health}} and well-being of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). However, housing instability remains prevalent among this population due to a range of socioecological factors. This paper provides a review of the relevant literature and a cost comparison of organizations that provide shelter and related services in Pittsburgh, PA. It was hypothesized that the comparator organization, The Open Door, Inc., provides housing services for PLWHA at a lower per-night, per-person cost when compared to alternative organizations that provide non-permanent housing. Organizations targeted for data collection were shelters, temporary/transitional housing programs, correctional facilities, hospitals/medical facilities, psychological/behavioral health facilities, and substance use rehabilitation facilities within the city of Pittsburgh. Data collection was completed through website searches, review of non-profit profiles on www. guidestar. org, and contact with staff members of participating organizations. Data sets were gathered and/or confirmed for 33 organizations. Findings indicate that residential programs charge served individuals no or nominal per-night, per-person fees, with <b>annual</b> <b>implementation</b> costs <b>reported</b> separately. The $ 12. 50 nightly rate charged to the client by The Open Door is comparable to other transitional housing programs. Hospitals and correctional facilities report substantially higher per-night, per-person room and board rates that are inclusive of implementation costs; these fees involve direct charges to the individual as well as systems-level coverage such as health insurance and tax dollars. The comparator organization likely alleviates costs to the system by limiting stays at non-residential and emergency facilities and supporting the securing of permanent residencies. This research involves several issues of public health significance: expansion of the academic literature, HIV/AIDS, housing instability, sheltering approaches, social justice issues, housing as healthcare, and related costs. Results offer a pilot cost comparison that demonstrates housing needs of PLWHA, opportunities for improving efforts to alleviate the issue, and recommendations for future cost comparisons and service provision...|$|R
50|$|In {{compliance}} with the August 2011 Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Justice and Executive Order 12898 (MOU), USDA released a final Environmental Justice Strategic Plan: 2012 to 2014 on February 7, 2012 (Strategic Plan), which identifies new and updated goals and performance measures beyond what USDA identified in a 1995 EJ strategy it adopted in response to E.O. 12898. In the same week, it also released its first <b>annual</b> <b>implementation</b> progress <b>report</b> (Progress Report), as the MOU also required. The Secretary's message accompanying the Strategic Plan described two immediate tasks: 1) each agency within USDA is required to identify a point of contact for EJ issues, at the Senior Executive Service (SES) level; and 2) each agency must develop its own EJ strategy prior to April 15, 2012, and begin implementing {{it as soon as}} possible. As of May 2012, it did not appear that such strategies had been made public, although sub-agencies provided internal reports to the USDA's EJ steering committee on April 9, 2012, according to Holmes. USDA has determined that it can achieve the requirements of the Executive Order by integrating EJ into its programs, rather than implementing new and costly programs. The agency took this same approach in an EJ strategy it adopted in 1995. In some areas, such as agricultural chemicals and effects to migrant workers, USDA reviews its practices to identify potential disproportionate, adverse impacts on EJ communities, according to Blake Velde, Senior Environmental Scientist with the USDA Hazardous Materials Management Division. Generally, however, USDA believes its existing technical and financial assistance programs provide solutions to environmental inequity, such as its initiatives on education, food deserts, and economic development in impacted communities, and ensuring access to environmental benefits is the focus of USDA's EJ efforts.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} two issues. Firstly, {{statistical}} work was undertaken examining profit margins, labour productivity and {{total factor productivity}} in telecommunications in ten member states of the EU over a 21 -year period (not all member states of the EU could be included due to data inadequacy). Also, three non-members, namely Switzerland, Japan and US, were included for comparison. This research was to provide {{an understanding of how}} telecoms in the European Union (EU) have developed. There are two propositions {{in this part of the}} thesis: (i) privatisation and market liberalisation improve performance; (ii) countries that liberalised their telecoms sectors first show a better productivity growth than countries that liberalised later. In sum, a mixed picture is revealed. Some countries performed better than others over time, but there is no apparent relationship between productivity performance and the two propositions. Some of the results from this part of the thesis were published in Dabler et al. (2002). Secondly, the remainder of the tests the proposition that the telecoms directives of the European Commission created harmonised regulatory systems in the member states of the EU. By undertaking explanatory research, this thesis not only seeks to establish whether harmonisation has been achieved, but also tries to find an explanation as to why this is so. To accomplish this, as a first stage to questionnaire survey was administered to the fifteen telecoms regulators in the EU. The purpose of the survey was to provide knowledge of methods, rationales and approaches adopted by the regulatory offices across the EU. This allowed for the decision as to whether harmonisation in telecoms regulation has been achieved. Stemming from the results of the questionnaire analysis, follow-up case studies with four telecoms regulators were undertaken, in a second stage of this research. The objective of these case studies was to take into account the country-specific circumstances of telecoms regulation in the EU. To undertake the case studies, several sources of evidence were combined. More specifically, the <b>annual</b> <b>Implementation</b> <b>Reports</b> of the European Commission were reviewed, alongside the findings from the questionnaire. Then, interviews with senior members of staff in the four regulatory authorities were conducted. Finally, the evidence from the questionnaire survey and from the case studies was corroborated to provide an explanation as to why telecoms regulation in the EU has reached or has not reached a state of harmonisation. In addition to testing whether harmonisation has been achieved and why, this research has found evidence of different approaches to control over telecoms regulators and to market intervention administered by telecoms regulators within the EU. Regarding regulatory control, it was found that some member states have adopted mainly a proceduralist model, some have implemented more of a substantive model, and others have adopted a mix between both. Some findings from the second stage of the research were published in Dabler and Parker (2004). Similarly, regarding market intervention by regulatory authorities, different member states treat market intervention differently, namely according to market-driven or non-market-driven models, or a mix between both approaches.

40|$|Monitoring and {{evaluation}} of health services delivery {{is an essential part}} of managing health. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare through the directorate of Policy and Planning has developed an analytical “Health Sector Performance Profile Report” which is evidence based with the aim to provide a clear picture on the performance of health delivery systems in Tanzania Mainland. The general objective is to assess and evaluate efficiency, effectiveness and impact of health delivery services in the country. Specifically, the report provide an evaluation on: Thirty-three selected health performance indicators; Milestones set during Joint Appraisal Health Sector Review for 2006; Public Expenditure Review report; Medium Term Expenditure Framework for FY 2006 / 07 and Assessment of council health services. The selected performance indicators are grouped in the following categories:Information on resources such as financial and human resources,Information which assess the quality of services in the country (process indicators),Output and outcome information and Information on the health status of the population. Milestones which were set during the Joint Appraisal Health Sector Review in 2006 were put in the following main groupings: Drugs and Medical Supplies,Availability of financial resources, Public Private Partnership, Availability of human resources, Sector Evaluation and Monitoring,HIV/AIDS,Reproductive and child health, SWAP and Social Welfare. The public expenditure review gives an assessment of sector financing in terms of sources of funds and financial expenditure for FY 2006 / 07 at central and council levels. The assessment wanted to track if at all there is an improvement in health sector financing from different sources. For the medium term expenditure review the report covers FY 2006 / 07 whereby the performance takes into consideration problems and constraints/limitations to effective implementation of planned activities. Assessment of council health services the main objective was to evaluate the <b>annual</b> <b>implementation</b> of the comprehensive council health plan reports; they have six specific objectives to be evaluated: To review and evaluate the Annual (2006 / 07) Comprehensive Council Health Plans <b>Implementation</b> <b>Reports</b> from 121 Councils to see if the implemented planned health interventions are addressing health problems and are achieving set objectives and targets through compilation of performance indicators. To review and evaluate 1 st quarter (July- Sept 2007) <b>implementation</b> <b>reports</b> from 132 Councils to see if they have met the requirements, both physical & financial criteria. To assess RS/RHMT capabilities and commitment in assessing Councils’ progress reports submitted to (PMORALG and MoHSW) To short list and summarize observations derived from the evaluation exercise for improvement of the reports prepared by Councils in future and recommend to the management of the Ministries, for decision making to improve overall performance of Councils and Regional Secretariats. To evaluate quality of the assessment/evaluation criterion in respect of completeness, consistence, accuracy and relevance in measuring the desired results in the implementation of CCHP(s) by LGAs. To consolidate and recommend to the Basket Financing Committee the evaluation results of the first quarter (July – September 2007) technical and financial <b>implementation</b> <b>reports</b> of the LGAs for approval and funding of third and fourth quarters 2007 / 08 CCHPs. ...|$|R
