40|$|Linkage between {{understanding}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> "original" <b>nature</b> {{of scientific}} knowledge and attitude toward creative problem solving was examined in this case study, where 146 students at the 9 th grade of attached lower secondary high school to faculty of education, national university were involved. Among two different understanding level groups based upon the responses of understanding <b>about</b> <b>the</b> "original" <b>nature</b> {{of scientific knowledge}}, similarities and differences in the attitude toward creative problem solving were analyzed {{to see if there}} was any positive linkage. Major findings could be summarized as follows: (1) Linkage was clearly found between understanding <b>about</b> <b>the</b> "original" <b>nature</b> of scientific knowledge and the positive attitude toward "creative problem solving" as a whole. (2) Furthermore, linkage was clearly found between understanding <b>about</b> <b>the</b> "original" <b>nature</b> of scientific knowledge and the positive attitude toward "construction of new knowledge" as a second factor...|$|R

5|$|Aware of the {{importance}} of causal structure, Roger Penrose and others developed what is known as global geometry. In global geometry, the object of study is not one particular solution (or family of solutions) to Einstein's equations.

40|$|Does {{studying}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature(s)</b> {{of science}} {{contribute to a}} prospective teachers' effectiveness as a science teacher? This research {{grew out of a}} course created by a science educator and historian of science who believed prospective teachers needed more complex understandings of the cultural wars surrounding science. The research team consisted of five prospective teachers who participated in the course as well as the two instructors. This paper describes the experience of participating in the course from both perspectives. We argue that studying the cultural wars over science contributes to prospective teachers' professional growth as much because the course elicits tacit beliefs about school science as it introduces more complex understandings of science. We found that prospective teachers' tacit beliefs about school science were their greatest barrier to developing more complex understandings <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature(s)</b> of science. We contend that willingness to grapple with complexity and developing a professional identity by locating oneself in <b>the</b> conversations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature(s)</b> of science are better criteria for determining the professional growth of prospective teachers than knowledge measures. Finally, we argue that prospective teachers should be viewed as professionals who are responsible for finding their own voice, making their own decisions, and considering the consequences of their beliefs on their practice. This study raises questions critical to teacher education programs for prospective teachers and teacher-educators alike...|$|R
