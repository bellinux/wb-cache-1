She is also the owner of a popular nightclub in Hamburg. She commands H.A.R.M. troops on-field and is one of Cate's main enemies. She is also supposedly a distant relation of Richard Wagner.|$|E
5|$|Inverse {{psoriasis}} (also {{known as}} flexural psoriasis) appears as smooth, inflamed patches of skin. The patches frequently affect skin folds, particularly around the genitals (between the thigh and groin), the armpits, {{in the skin}} folds of <b>an</b> <b>overweight</b> abdomen (known as panniculus), between the buttocks in the intergluteal cleft, and under the breasts in the inframammary fold. Heat, trauma, and infection are thought {{to play a role}} in the development of this atypical form of psoriasis.|$|E

An alternative cover featuring Moon dressed in black lingerie and a brown wig, holding a whip, was later used for the inside art for the 1995 and 2003 CD releases. Some of the photographs taken during these sessions were later used as part of Decca's United States promotion of the album.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, O'Brien {{skipped the}} Australian Championships {{because he had}} no {{sponsorship}} and ran out of money, forcing him to seek full-time work. In 1968, despite Graham Edwards winning the National 200m breaststroke title, the Australian Swimming Union persuaded <b>an</b> <b>overweight</b> O'Brien to make a comeback in 1968 on the grounds that Australia did not have a quality breaststroker for the Olympics. Undergoing a crash diet and fitness program, O'Brien lost 12.7kg in twelve weeks of intense training. O'Brien was unable to reclaim either of his individual Australian titles, but New South Wales again won the medley relay. Nevertheless, he was selected for his second Olympics.|$|E

5|$|The first Alfa-Romeo engined Brabham, the Brabham BT45 was <b>an</b> <b>overweight</b> and bulky car, {{initially}} weighing 625kg and {{as wide as}} {{was permitted}} under the F1 technical regulations. This {{was due to the}} difficulties of packaging the large, powerful Alfa flat-12 engine and the fuel it required to complete a race distance. After lengthy development, it became competitive, but never won a race. In mid-1977, Brabham designer Gordon Murray started work on the ambitious design of the BT46. It was intended to compensate for the weight of the engine and fuel and allow the Brabham team to take a large technical step forward as well as to improve safety.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} had {{a prolonged}} genesis. Ingres agonised over the pose and made several preparatory sketches. The final work faithfully captures the sitter's character, conveying both a restless energy and imposing bulk. It is an unflinchingly realistic depiction of ageing and emphasises the furrowed skin and thinning hair of <b>an</b> <b>overweight</b> man who yet maintains his resolve and determination. He sits in three-quarter profile against a brown ground lit from the right, his fingers are pronounced and highly detailed, while the polish {{of his chair}} reflects light from an unseen window.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Century Falls {{is driven}} by a legend that no {{children}} {{had been born in}} the eponymous village for more than forty years. The lead protagonist, Tess Hunter (Catherine Sanderson), is <b>an</b> <b>overweight</b> teenager who moves to the village with her mother {{at the beginning of the}} serial. She quickly befriends the psychic Ben Naismith (Simon Fenton) and his twin sister Carey (Emma Jane Lavin). The three teenagers examine the waterfall that gave Ben his powers and the disaster that caused the legendary infertility. The serial climaxes in a confrontation between Tess and the deity Century, who is attempting to fuse with Tess's unborn sister.|$|E

5|$|Doink the Clown had annoyed Bam Bam Bigelow {{throughout}} October and November {{with such}} pranks as throwing water and confetti {{on him and}} dumping a pail of water on Bigelow's on-screen girlfriend Luna Vachon. He also tied a tripwire across the aisle during one of Bigelow's matches; after Bigelow fell over the wire, Doink attacked him with a broom. Bigelow responded by coming to the ring during one of Doink's matches and destroying Doink's toy wagon. The character of Doink was played by several wrestlers, who occasionally appeared at the same time. The match booked for Survivor Series advertised Bigelow teaming with Bastion Booger, who portrayed <b>an</b> <b>overweight</b> and dirty glutton, and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu), a team of Samoans who were portrayed as savages, to face four Doinks. To promote the match, Doink appeared on the video wall {{that was part of}} the set during Bigelow's matches leading up to the event. The wall used a split screen to show multiple Doinks talking and laughing at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Passan of Yahoo! Sports {{reported}} in January 2016 that Sandoval had switched agents {{and was now}} represented by Rick Thurman and Rafa Nieves of Beverly Hills Sports Council. Looking to improve upon his first season in Boston, <b>an</b> <b>overweight</b> Sandoval struggled in spring training, {{and was replaced by}} Travis Shaw as the starting third baseman. On April 13, 2016, Sandoval was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a shoulder strain. On May 3, 2016, Sandoval underwent surgery on his left shoulder, sidelining him {{for the remainder of the}} season. On September 24, manager John Farrell told reporters that Sandoval was progressing ahead of schedule in his rehab, and could be an option for the Red Sox in the postseason should a need arise, as the team did acquire Aaron Hill during the season to help with third base depth. Sandoval also made an effort at improving his fitness, losing 15 pounds by August while working at the Red Sox facility in Fort Myers. Due to the injury Sandoval ended his 2016 season with six at bats.|$|E
5|$|The formula {{was enacted}} as law {{to limit the}} weight-to-length ratio of a {{commercial}} motor vehicle (CMV). The formula is necessary to prevent the concentrated weight on a truck's axle from producing stress on bridge members (possibly causing a bridge collapse). In simplified form, this is analogous to a person walking on thin ice. When standing upright, a person's weight is concentrated {{at the bottom of}} their feet, funneling all of their weight into a small area. When lying down, a person's weight is distributed over a much larger area. This difference in weight distribution would allow a person to cross an area of ice while crawling that might otherwise collapse under their body weight while standing up. For <b>an</b> <b>overweight</b> truck to comply with the formula, more axles must be added, the distance between axles must be increased, or weight must be removed.|$|E

50|$|The main {{modification}} to Prospect Theory is that, as in rank-dependent expected utility theory, {{cumulative probabilities}} are transformed, {{rather than the}} probabilities itself. This leads to the aforementioned overweighting of extreme events which occur with small probability, rather than to <b>an</b> <b>overweighting</b> of all small probability events. The modification helps to avoid a violation of first order stochastic dominance and makes the generalization to arbitrary outcome distributions easier. CPT is therefore on theoretical grounds an improvement over Prospect Theory.|$|R

5|$|The {{lifeboats}} were lowered {{every few}} minutes on each side, {{but most of the}} boats were greatly under-filled. No.5 left with 41 aboard, No.3 had 32 aboard, No.8 left with 39 and No.1 left with just 12 out of a capacity of 40. The evacuation did not go smoothly and passengers suffered accidents and injuries as it progressed. One woman fell between lifeboat No.10 and the side of the ship but someone caught her by the ankle and hauled her back onto the promenade deck, where she made a second successful attempt at boarding. First-class passenger Annie Stengel broke several ribs when <b>an</b> <b>overweight</b> German-American doctor and his brother jumped into No.5, squashing her and knocking her unconscious. The lifeboats' descent was likewise risky. No.6 was nearly flooded during the descent by water discharging out of the ship's side, but successfully made it away from the ship. No.3 came close to disaster when, for a time, one of the davits jammed, threatening to pitch the passengers out of the lifeboat and into the sea.|$|E
