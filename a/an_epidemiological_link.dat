Molecular genetics methods, such as DNA sequencing and DNA-DNA hybridization, {{can be useful}} for correct identification, although work by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has suggested they are unnecessary in most cases. Several groups have used 16S rDNA sequencing to identify S.iniae isolates, and while it can differentiate this species from other related species, such as S.porcinus and S.uberis, 16S sequencing cannot be used to differentiate between strains of S.iniae.

40|$|Background: Non- Tuberculous Mycobacteria are {{environmental}} opportunistic pathogens {{that can}} be found in various terrestrial and aquatic habitats. There are <b>an</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>links</b> between species isolated in tap water and those isolated from patients. hsp 65 gene has more variability in its sequences, compared to the some more conserved genes in NTM, for identification of mycobacteria to species level. In this study, the prevalence of NTM in Isfahan City water samples was determined using culture, biochemical tests and PCR-RFLP analyses of hsp 65 gene. Methods: Eighty-five water samples were collected and cultured. The mycobacterial isolates were identified by conventional biochemical tests. A 441 bp fragment of hsp 65 genes was amplified and digested by two restriction enzymes, BstEII and HaeII. Digested products were analyzed using polyacrilamid gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Results: 25. 9 % of the water samples contained different species of NTM. Dominant isolates were M. fortuitum (26. 7 %), M. chelonae like organism (13. 3 %) and M. mucogenicum (13. 3 %). Nineteen isolates of Mycobacteria were differentiated using hsp 65 genes PCR-RFLP. Three isolates could not be identified at the species level because their RFLP patterns were different from other known PCR-RFLP profiles. There were different hsp 65 gene PCR-RFLP profiles produced by digestion with BstEII and HaeIII. Conclusion: This study showed that PCR-RFLP of hsp 65 gene in mycobacteria is more reliable method for identification of NTM at the specie level than conventional phenotypic methods (P< 0. 05). In comparing of RFLP patterns of this study to other investigation, some minor differences were negligible...|$|R

However, few {{multidisciplinary}} studies addressing the zoonotic pattern of this disease were conducted so far. Here, pig, deer and dog samples were collected. Analyses were performed using molecular detection and genotyping. Serological analyses were also performed for dogs. Our results suggest that deer are a reservoir of L. borgpetersenii Hardjobovis and pigs a reservoir of L. interrogans Pomona. Interestingly, 4. 4 % of dogs were renal carriers of Leptospira. In dog populations, MAT results confirmed the circulation of the same Leptospira serogroups involved in human cases. Even if not reservoirs, dogs might be of significance in human contamination by making <b>an</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>link</b> between wild or feral reservoirs and humans. Dogs could bring pathogens back home, shedding Leptospira via their urine and in turn increasing the risk of human contamination.

40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate {{intracellular}} {{bacterial pathogen}} {{and the second}} leading cause of sexually transmitted infections in the US. Infections cause significant morbidity {{and can lead to}} serious reproductive sequelae, including <b>an</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>link</b> to increased rates of reproductive cancers. One of the overt changes that infected cells exhibit is the development of genomic instability leading to multinucleation. Here we demonstrate that the induction of multinucleation is not conserved equally across chlamydial species; C. trachomatis L 2 caused high levels of multinucleation, C. muridarum intermediate levels, and C. caviae had very modest effects on multinucleation. Our data show that at least two effector pathways together cause genomic instability during infection leading to multinucleation. We find that the highly conserved chlamydial protease CPAF is a key effector for one of these pathways. CPAF secretion is required for the loss of centrosome duplication regulation as well as inducing early mitotic exit. The second effector pathway involves the induction of centrosome position errors. This function is not conserved in three chlamydial species tested. Together these two pathways contribute to the induction of high levels of genomic instability and multinucleation seen in C. trachomatis infections...|$|E

Here, we evaluated the performances of this MIRU-VNTR typing system in combination with spoligotyping {{for the detection of}} transmission chains in a population-based study comprising 91 % of culture-confirmed tuberculosis patients reported in 2003 in Hamburg, Germany. Of the 154 isolates investigated, more than 90 % had high IS 6110 copy numbers (≥ 6). IS 6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing resulted in 13 clusters, 5 of which had <b>a</b> confirmed <b>epidemiological</b> <b>link.</b> All five, as well as six of the eight IS 6110 clusters with no identified <b>epidemiological</b> <b>link,</b> were perfectly matched by MIRU-VNTR typing with the 24 loci.

In contrast, only one MIRU-VNTR cluster, grouping what were probably epidemiologically unlinked isolates, was split by IS 6110 RFLP. However, these isolates were also distinguished by spoligotyping. Both the optimized 24 -locus and 15 -locus sets thus showed a comparable to slightly better predictive value, especially when combined with spoligotyping, than the current gold standard IS 6110 RFLP for the study of tuberculosis transmission in Hamburg.
