50|$|The urease <b>agar</b> <b>slant</b> is used {{to measure}} an organism’s ability to produce urease, an enzyme capable to digesting urea in carbon dioxide and ammonia through hydrolysis. Because ammonia is alkaline, the media {{contains}} phenol red, an indicator that changes from orange to pink when a pH increases above 8.1.  When ammonia is increased to high enough concentrations, the media will change to a pink color, indicating the presence of urease production.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to evaluate in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Ketoconazole and extracts from trunk’s barks of Terminalia ivorensis A. Chev (Combretaceae). In vitro antimicrobial activity of all the extracts was done by <b>agar</b> <b>slant.</b> Extracts were incorporated in Sabouraud medium culture and extract has been inserted to this medium according to the <b>Agar</b> <b>slant</b> method and Ketoconazole were used as standards for antifungal assay. Antimicrobial activity was determined by diminution of mushroom in the assay tubes. For each extract five tests were done. The antifungal activity was more pronounced against Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. interdigitale. The fraction F 8 showed best antifungal activity. T. ivorensis barks extracts showed better antifungal activity than commercially used antibiotics. Demonstration of antimicrobial activity of T. ivorensis provides the scientific basis {{for the use of}} this plant in the traditional treatment of diseases and may help to discover new chemical classes of antibiotic substances that could serve as selective agents for infectious and cutaneous diseases. This investigation has opened up the possibility of the use of this plant in drug development for human consumption possibly for the treatment of various infections caused by opportunists’ mushrooms. </p...|$|E

40|$|Earthworm plays a {{major role}} in the proper {{functioning}} of the soil ecosystem. It acts as scavenger and helps in recycling of dead and decayed plant material by feeding on them. Earthworm increases the soil fertility and is often referred to as a farmer’s friend. Earthworms have been used in medicine for various remedies. The paste prepared from earthworm, Eudrilus eugeniae was tested for antibacterial, antifungal activities. For the antimicrobial screening, four species of bacterial isolate and two species of fungal isolates were selected. The bacterial cultures were used for antimicrobial testing maintained on nutrient <b>agar</b> <b>slant</b> and the fungal strains were maintained on Sabouraud dextrose <b>agar</b> <b>slant</b> at 4 °C. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using micro dilution broth method. Earthworm paste at a dose of 100 µl was able to inhibit the growth of bacteria of S. aureus at a maximum level as compared to other bacteria; the growth of fungal Candida albicans was much inhibited. The MIC results indicated that earthworm paste at a dose of 200 µl inhibited the bacterial growth. These studies may lead to the formulation of new antimicrobial drug. The antimicrobial activity of the paste was determined by an agar diffusion method using well and disc, the study clearly indicates that the paste contain a good antibacterial potential and the bioactive compounds to inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi.
