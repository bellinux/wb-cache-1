40|$|This paper {{starts with}} the {{assumption}} that the EU will decide to open accession negotiations with Turkey at the end of 2004 and in this context it explores the potential for the integration of EU and Turkish foreign, security and defence policies in the pre-accession period. The evolving nature of both the EU and Turkey as foreign policy actors is considered, with attention drawn to the effective graduations {{in the nature of the}} EU’s external borders as it extends its membership and <b>association</b> <b>arrangements</b> deeper into the south-eastern periphery. Turkish capabilities are reviewed, ranging from the subjective arguments about its experience as a democratising, secular state of largely Muslim culture, through to objective assets such as military capabilities and cultural affinities with various neighbouring peoples. With the Turkish neighbourhood thus becoming the EU’s wider neighbourhood, the paper reviews how far the EU and Turkey may be convergent in their interests and complementary in their capabilities in such regions as the Balkans, the Caucasus, the Middle East and Central Asia. The paper concludes with the assessment that Turkey stands to be an unequivocal asset for the EU’s external policies...|$|E

50|$|An {{associated}} {{state is}} the minor partner in a formal, free relationship between a political territory {{with a degree of}} statehood and a (usually larger) nation, for which no other specific term, such as protectorate, is adopted.

5000|$|Sidewalk life {{permits a}} range of casual public interactions, from asking for {{directions}} and getting advice from the grocer, to nodding hello to passersby and admiring a new dog. [...] "Most of it is ostensibly trivial but the sum is not trivial at all." [...] The sum is [...] "a web of public respect and trust," [...] the essence {{of which is that}} it [...] "implies no private commitments" [...] and protects precious privacy. In other words, city dwellers know that they can engage in sidewalk life without fear of [...] "entangling relationships" [...] or oversharing the details of one's personal life. Jacobs contrasts this to areas with no sidewalk life, including low-density suburbia, where residents must either expose a more significant portion of their private lives to a small number of intimate contacts or else settle for a lack of contact altogether. In order to sustain the former, residents must become exceedingly deliberate in choosing their neighbors and their <b>associations.</b> <b>Arrangements</b> of this sort, Jacobs argues, can work well [...] "for self-selected upper-middle-class people," [...] but fails to work for anyone else.|$|R
50|$|However, {{even though}} both the Cook Islands and Niue behave as {{sovereign}} states in international law, their constitutional statuses within the Realm of New Zealand (i.e., for matters of New Zealand domestic law) {{is different from that}} of a fully independent state, considering that all of Niue's and the Cook Islands' nationals are automatically New Zealand citizens, and both have New Zealand's head of state, Elizabeth II, as their own. On the basis of these arrangements, Prime Minister Helen Clark declared in 2001 that if the Cook Islands were to join the United Nations, the act would be interpreted by New Zealand as a declaration of independence, leading Cook Islanders to lose the right to New Zealand citizenship. This was reiterated by PM John Key in 2015. Some scholars have argued that this position by New Zealand places an effective limit on the ability of the Cook Islands to act as a sovereign entity, while others have argued that the participation of the Cook Islands in international organisations (such as the Pacific Islands Forum) shows that Cook Islands sovereignty is not limited by the free <b>association</b> <b>arrangement.</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND. There {{is concern}} about but little {{information}} on how living alone affects the health and survival of older adults. METHODS. We examined the <b>association</b> between living <b>arrangements</b> (living alone, with a spouse, or with someone other than a spouse) and survival among 7651 adults, aged 45 to 74 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) (1971 - 1975) and traced at the NHANES I Follow-up Study (1982 - 1984), to see whether certain sociodemographic factors (race, education, income, and employment), health behaviors (alcohol, smoking, physical activity, and obesity), or chronic medical conditions were influential in the association. RESULTS. We found a stronger <b>association</b> of living <b>arrangements</b> with survival for men than for women, and for middle-aged men than for older men. For men, those living alone and those living with someone other than a spouse were equally disadvantaged in terms of survival. Income, race, employment, and physical activity influenced the <b>association</b> of living <b>arrangements</b> and survival, but their impact varied by age, gender, and living arrangement. CONCLUSION. Living arrangements had a weak impact on survival among men, but had no effect among women...|$|R

40|$|Background: Household living arrangement, {{whether an}} {{individual}} lives alone, with family, or with unrelated persons, may predict {{quality of life}} in adults with mental illness, as it influences social interactions and availability of immediate resources. Objective: To assess the relationship between living arrangement and {{quality of life in}} adults with mental illness. Design: Secondary analysis of 294 community-dwelling adults with mental illness. Linear regression was used to estimate the <b>association</b> between living <b>arrangement</b> and quality of life. Results: Initially, linear regression analysis did not suggest a strong association between quality of life and living arrangement; however, further analysis suggested that social support mediates the relationship between living arrangement and quality of life in adults with mental illness. Conclusion: Future research should address the limitations of the current study to advance the understanding of the <b>association</b> between living <b>arrangement</b> and quality of life in this population...|$|R
40|$|Family {{resources}} {{may play}} an important role in the wellbeing of older people. In this paper, we examine the <b>association</b> between living <b>arrangement</b> and cognitive decline among people over living in different European countries. The underlined hypothesis is that living with others (i. e. spouse or/and children) vis-à-vis living alone may have a positive role in maintaining cognitive functioning, but also that such beneficial influence varies according to the circumstances. To this end, we used data from the first two waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), which provides indicators of several cognitive functions: orientation, immediate recall, delayed recall, verbal fluency and numeracy. Net of both the potential biases due to the selective attrition and the re-test effects, the evidence shows that the <b>association</b> between living <b>arrangement</b> and cognitive decline depends on the geographical area and on the starting level of cognitive function...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 30 male mice, DD strain, between 50 ～ 60 days old, {{were divided into}} 6 groups {{consisting}} of 5 mice each. All the mice had been reared in an almost constant temperature at between 22 〜 24 ℃ and they also had an almost constant daily period of natural and artificial light from about 6 am to about 6 pm. These conditions were maintained throughout the experimental period. The groups were killed at four-hour intervals over a 24 -hour period. Cross sections of seminiferous tubules were examined microscopically {{to determine whether the}} diurnal fluctuations and variations due to testes within animals or due to loci within testes might exist in the relative frequencies of the stages. Identification of each stage of the cycle applied here was similar to that described previously by ROOSEN-RUNGE & GIESEL. The method of testing for significant differences in the frequencies among groups of each experiment is based on discriminatory analysis and the results obtained were as follows : 1) A typical cellular <b>association</b> <b>arrangement</b> for each stage was found in all but a few seminiferous tubules observed here. 2) No obvious diurnal fluctuation in the relative frequency of the stages was found among the 6 times required for removal of testes or among the uniform periods dispersed throughout a 24 -hour period. 3) Significant differences in the frequencies of the stages were found between testes within individuals and among 3 loci within testes (P< 0. 05) ...|$|R
