2500|$|The brass section usually {{includes}} trumpets or cornets; French horns, <b>alto</b> <b>horns,</b> or mellophones; tenor trombones; {{baritone horns}} or euphoniums; and tubas or sousaphones. E♭soprano cornets are sometimes used to supplement or replace the high woodwinds, while the mellophone often {{is used in}} place of the French horn. Some especially large bands use flugelhorns and bass trombones. Specially designed versions of the lower brass have been created for use while marching. [...] These are typically wrapped {{in such a way that}} allow the bell to face toward the audience at all times. [...] Bands may also modify their instrumentation to remove slide trombones completely and replace them with another instrument, such as a valved trombone or marching baritone horn.|$|E
2500|$|While the brass-only {{configuration}} {{has been}} unvarying since 1934, the instrumentation has {{been subject to}} experimentation over the years. Around 1938, slide trombones {{were removed from the}} band for fear they could not easily navigate the difficult Script Ohio drill. Trombones were originally replaced by tenor horns, and then eventually by the King 3B valve trombone - a valve trombone wrapped as a Euphonium - earning the name [...] "Trombonium." [...] By 1970, the band adopted the large-bore Conn 90G, prepared by Conn at the OSUMB's instigation. Slide trombones returned to the band in 1980, with the introduction of Bach Model 36 Stradivarius small shank tenor trombones. Tromboniums last marched in the varsity OSUMB block at the 1982 Alumni Reunion game, but continue to be used by Alumni members of the band. In 1997, the band converted the alto voice of the band from Eb <b>Alto</b> <b>horns,</b> to F Mellophones. Several factors including instrument quality and durability, as well as tone projection, were cited in the switch. The last Eb <b>Alto</b> <b>horns</b> purchased by the OSUMB were Yamaha YAH-203's. The band switched to Getzen G4410 F Mellophones, and continued to use those until 2000, when Getzen discontinued that instrument. The band switched to King 1120SP F Mellophones, and slowly phased these, along with the King 1121SP, which is the newest version of King Mellophone, through 2006. All Getzen Mellophones are now used by Alumni Band or the OSU Athletic Band. In 1999, Dr. Jon Woods, a trombone player himself, added Bass Trombones to the trombone section. This was done in an effort to round out the trombone choir, and to give a bit of an edge to Sousaphone parts in climactic music. The first model, and to date, only model of Bass Trombone used by the OSUMB is the Conn 110H. In 2008, the band received a generous donation which allowed the entire high brass section (Eb Cornets, Trumpets, and Flugelhorns) to be outfitted with new Yamaha Xeno model instruments. These horns greatly influenced the sound of the band, as previous models of trumpets and flugelhorns were student level models, which typically are not constructed with the same quality as professional model instruments, such as the Xeno line. In 2013, the band has begun a switch from King 2104SP tenor trombones to a special order Conn 8HY model.|$|E

5000|$|The alto bugle is a {{voice that}} was created during the two piston era in the 1970s. These {{instruments}} were loosely based on the <b>alto</b> <b>horns</b> used in marching bands and brass bands in a bell-front marching configuration. Alto bugles are still manufactured today in a three valve configuration. Bore size for the alto bugle typically ranges from [...]468"-.470" [...] As an alto voice in G, {{it has the same}} bottom end of its range as the soprano family.|$|E
50|$|A {{brass band}} is {{primarily}} {{made up of}} a large number of musicians playing brass instruments such as flugelhorns, trumpets, <b>alto</b> <b>horns,</b> helicons, euphoniums, tenor horns, tubas, baritone horns, wagner tubas and sometimes trombones. Percussion is provided by snare drum and bass drums, traditionally davuls (also known as tapan or goč) carried by the performers. A few bands occasionally sport clash cymbals, or use a snare drum with a suspended cymbal attachment while most bands attach the cymbals to the bass drum.|$|E
50|$|Bandas {{usually have}} a strong percussion. The percussionists {{generally}} provide the accents and do not usually play all the time or keep a 'groove'. Often the percussionists will enter only when the singer is not singing, such as in an instrumental chorus. The groove is mostly provided by the sousaphone (or bass guitar in a few recordings) playing the bass line, and the <b>alto</b> <b>horns</b> playing sharp upbeats. Typically when a banda plays a cumbia, the alto horn players switch to Latin percussion instruments such as maracas, cowbell, congas, bongos and guiro.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and {{throughout}} the 1990s many new bandas were so-called [...] "technobandas" [...] or [...] "electrobandas", in which {{some or all of}} the horns were replaced by electric instruments. A typical technobanda will substitute a sousaphone with electric bass and the two <b>alto</b> <b>horns</b> with a synthesizer and a guitar. The clarinets were frequently replaced with saxophones also. However the bass part is still played in a style imitating a sousaphone, using a Synthesizer or substituting using a double bass or a bass guitar. These technobandas created the early movement of la Quebradita.|$|E
50|$|The brass section usually {{includes}} trumpets or cornets; French horns, <b>alto</b> <b>horns,</b> or mellophones; tenor trombones; {{baritone horns}} or euphoniums; and tubas or sousaphones.

5000|$|A typical banda {{is made up}} of brass, woodwind, and {{percussion}} instruments. The {{most notable}} instrument is the tambora which is a type of bass drum with a head made from animal hide, with a cymbal on top. Bandas were previously called [...] "tamboras", named after this drum. The tambora is played in a strong and embellished manner, which provides the drive {{for the rest of the}} band. The percussion section also includes the tarola which is a snare with timbales which would resemble the tom-toms on a regular drumset, cowbells, and cymbals. Banda el Recodo, one of the most famous bandas, features three trumpets, four clarinets, three valve trombones or slide trombones, two E <b>alto</b> <b>horns,</b> and one sousaphone.|$|E

5000|$|On November 21, 1981, {{under the}} baton of {{conductor}} Robert Bernat, the River City Brass {{took to the}} Carnegie Music Hall stage for its inaugural concert. Building upon the long-standing tradition of brass bands popularized in Great Britain and the United States, RCB features 25 brass players and 3 percussionists. RCB differs from most brass bands in that the instrumentation has been altered. French Horns are used instead of <b>alto</b> <b>horns,</b> and an Eb soprano trumpet is employed {{in place of a}} soprano cornet. The result of the soprano trumpet is a lighter, brighter, more [...] "orchestral" [...] sound than the traditional brass band.The Band has been a featured performer at the Adelaide Festival of the Arts (Australia), Musikfest (Pennsylvania), Chautauqua Institution (New York), New Zealand International Festival of the Arts, Interlochen Center for the Arts, (Michigan), and Thalian Hall (North Carolina), among many other venues across the world.Since 1986, River City Brass has run a youth program, known as the River City Youth Brass Band, which enables young musicians to hone their craft under the close supervision of professional players as part of the band's overall mission.|$|E
40|$|Paul Robert Fauchet's Symphonie pour Musique d'Harmonie, {{known in}} the United States as Symphony in B-flat, is a four-movement {{composition}} spanning nearly thirty minutes in length and written {{in the style of}} the late romantic composers. Despite its place as one of the first symphonies for wind band, a performance of the piece that represents the composer's 1926 orchestration is difficult due to the inclusion of instruments that are no longer in common practice, including bugles, <b>alto</b> <b>horns,</b> and saxhorns. Later American editions of the work by James Robert Gillette (1933) and Frank Campbell-Watson (1948 / 1949) replaced these instruments, but also took several other liberties with orchestration and voicing. The primary purpose of this study was the creation of a performance edition of the Symphony for modern wind band that is accessible to a larger audience of performers and listeners. The method involved in creating the modern edition eliminates errors of extant editions and clarifies a number of the discrepancies surrounding the symphony's multiple publications. This edition attempts to retain the composer's voicing and orchestration choices. To accomplish this, the present project considered where modern instrumentation differed from the original sources and attempted to balance timbral similarities between those instruments, while also considering ease of comprehension for a modern ensemble to perform the work. Sources used to create this edition included all published editions of scores and parts, as well as a newly created full score of the 1926 printed parts. The study concludes with the inclusion of the full score of the new performance edition...|$|E
