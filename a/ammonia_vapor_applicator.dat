The composites sintered at 900 oC for 5 h, were subjected to dc resistance measurements in the temperature range of 50 - 250 oC to study the <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor</b> sensing characteristics. With increase in temperature the sensitivity increases up to the optimum temperature and thereafter decreases. An increase in the sensitivity was observed with increase in ammonia concentration from 100 - 5000 ppm at their respective optimum temperature.

40|$|Absorption {{phenomenon}} of <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor</b> into <b>ammonia</b> water solution {{has been investigated}} experimentally, by inserting superheated <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor</b> into a test cell containing a stagnant pool of ammonia water solution. Before commencing the experiment, the pressure in the test cell corresponds to the equilibrium vapor of the ammonia-water system at room temperature. When the valve is opened, mechanical equilibrium is established quickly and the pressure in the test cell becomes {{equal to that of}} the <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor</b> cylinder. The difference between the initial pressure in the vapor cylinder and the initial pressure in the test cell is found to have a major influence on the absorption rate. The main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of this initial pressure difference on the absorption rate of <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor.</b> A correlation which gives the total absorbed mass of ammonia as a function of the initial concentration, the initial pressure difference and time is derived to estimate the mass absorption rate of <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor</b> into ammonia-water solution. The absorbed mass at no pressure difference could be estimated from the absorbed mass at initial pressure difference. In addition the absorption process has been visualized by a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and the obtained fringes have been analyzed to get the concentration distribution together with that obtained by theoretical solution in which ammonia concentration at the interface changes with time. The obtained optical images allowed us to distinguish between two layers with different speeds of fringes propagation. The layer with slow propagation of fringes reflects pure mass diffusion with negligible heat effect especially after long time from starting the absorption, while the layer with fast propagation of fringes reflects a thermal controlled diffusion...|$|R

We perform an analysis of five brightness temperature maps that span epochs from 2005 to 2011, which are presented in a companion paper by Janssen et al. (2013 a, this issue). The brightness temperature maps {{are representative of the}} spatial distribution of <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor,</b> since <b>ammonia</b> gas is the only effective opacity source in Saturn's atmosphere at 2. 2 -cm wavelength. Relatively high brightness temperatures indicate relatively low ammonia relative humidity (RH), and vice versa. We compare the observed brightness temperatures to brightness temperatures computed using the Juno atmospheric microwave radiative transfer (JAMRT) program which includes both the means to calculate a tropospheric atmosphere model for Saturn and the means to carry out radiative transfer calculations at microwave frequencies. The reference atmosphere to which we compare has a 3 x solar deep mixing ratio of ammonia (we use 1. 352 x 10 (exp - 4) for the solar mixing ratio of <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor</b> relative to H 2; see Atreya, 2010) and is fully saturated above its cloud base.

40|$|Radio astronomical {{observations}} of Uranus {{show that the}} radio emission spectrum is evolving in time. <b>Ammonia</b> <b>vapor</b> must be depleted in the Uranian atmosphere as Gulkis et al. (1978) previously suggested. Since 1965, ammonia either has been decreasing in time or is a decreasing function of latitude, or both, provided that the radio emission is atmospheric in origin. If Uranus has an observable low-emissivity 'surface', these trends may be reversed. The microwave observations made in 1965, {{at the time when}} the spin axis of Uranus was nearly perpendicular to the sun-Uranus line, are consistent with an atmospheric opacity profile that would be produced by saturated <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor</b> in a predominantly hydrogen atmosphere. At the present time, when the spin axis of Uranus is nearly aligned with the sun-Uranus line, the measurements require an opacity that would be produced by saturated water vapor.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical study of absorption of <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor</b> bubbles into a constrained thin film of ammonia-water solution {{is presented in}} the context of a potential reduction in size of a heat-actuated heat pump component. A large-aspect-ratio channel with a depth of 600 µm restricts the thickness of the weak solution film, while <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor</b> bubbles are injected from a porous wall. Experiments are performed at a nominal system pressure of 6. 2 bar absolute and at an inlet weak solution temperature of 75 ºC. A counter-flowing coolant in a minichannel removes the generated heat of absorption. The mass flow rate of the weak solution, vapor flow rate, coolant inlet temperature, and mass flow rate of the coolant solution are varied. Two absorber channel geometries are considered: 1) a smooth 600 µm channel, and 2) a stepped geometry that has 2 -mm deep trenches across the width of one of the channel walls. The 1 -D, steady state species and energy transport equations, are solved for the smooth-channel absorber to yield, along the length of the channel, concentration and temperature profiles of the solution stream and the temperature profile of the coolant fluid stream...|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{occupational}} exposure limit values (OELs) are based on avoiding of sensory irritation of the eyes and the upper respiratory tract. In order to investigate the chemosensory effect range of a chemical, odor and sensory irritation thresholds (lateralization thresholds, LTs) can be assessed. Humidity affects olfactory function and thus influences odor thresholds; however, a similar effect has not been shown for sensory irritation thresholds. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to explore whether LTs for <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor</b> vary depending on the water vapor content of the inspired stimulus. Eight healthy nonsmoking volunteers were simultaneously exposed to <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor</b> through one nostril and clean air through the other and were asked to determine which nostril received the chemical. Within experimental runs, ascending ammonia concentrations (60 – 350 [*]ppm) that were either dry or humidified were administered at fixed time intervals. Geometric mean LTs obtained at wet (181 [*]ppm) or dry (172 [*]ppm) conditions did not differ significantly (P = 0. 19) and were within the range of those reported by previous studies. These results suggest that humidity is not a critical factor in determining sensory irritation thresholds for ammonia, and future studies will examine if these findings are transferable to sensory irritation thresholds for other chemicals...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the propagation of}} terahertz (THz) pulses resonant with the lowest rotational levels in <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapors</b> at room temperature. We demonstrate a quasisimultonic regime of propagation for two-color THz pulses (their lossless simultaneous propagation with equal group velocities and stable envelopes at finite distances, like coupled solitons). The quasisimultons are formed by two pulses synchronized in time, the first one being intense and two humped with an area multiple of 4 π, while the another one is weaker, one humped, and with an area much less than π. Two-and one-humped pulses have equal width and copropagate in <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor</b> at the same group velocity. Moreover, the larger the dip of the two-hump pulse is, the weaker may be the one-humped pulse. The stability of this coupled state {{is provided by the}} fact that the two-humped pulse makes the medium transparent for the one-humped pulse. In its turn, the latter prevents the breakup of the former into separate pulses. It is established as well that a multihumped pulse with an odd or even number of humps and a hyperbolic secant pulse can behave like a simulton. In this case, the area of multihumped pulse equals to 2 nπ, where n is the number of humps in the powerful pulse structure...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} the heat and mass transfer of ammonia water during the process of falling film evaporation in vertical tube evaporator, a mathematical model of evaporation process was developed and solved based on stream function. Then an experimental study of falling film evaporation was carried out in order to validate the mathematical model. A series of parameters, such as velocity, film thickness and concentration, etc., were obtained from the mathematical model. The calculated results show that the average velocity and the film thickness change sharp at the entrance region when x 100 mm. The film thickness depends largely on the flow rate of solution. It is observed that the heating power and mass flow of solution significantly affect the concentration difference between the inlet and outlet of evaporation tube. The calculated results reveal that the tube length has {{a significant impact on the}} amounts of <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor</b> evaporated. It is suggested that the roll-worked enhanced tube should be used in order to decrease the concentration gradient in the film thickness direction and enhance the heat and mass transfer rate. Furthermore, the experimental and calculated results indicate that the inlet solution concentration has a great influence on the heat exchange capacity, the amounts of <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor</b> evaporated and the evaporation pressure...|$|R

Being present in all animals and humans it allows to survive adverse conditions like diving. Earlier we discovered that forehead stimulation affords neuroprotective effect decreasing infarction volume triggered by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats. We hypothesized that cold stimulation of the forehead induces diving response in rats, which, in turn, exerts neuroprotection. We compared autonomic (AP, HR, CBF) and EEG responses to the known diving response-triggering stimulus, ammonia stimulation of the nasal mucosa, cold stimulation of the forehead, and cold stimulation of the glabrous skin of the tail base in anesthetized rats. Responses in AP, HR, CBF and EEG to cold stimulation of the forehead and <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapors</b> instillation into the nasal cavity were comparable and differed significantly from responses to the cold stimulation of the tail base. Excitotoxic lesion of the subthalamic vasodilator area, which is known to participate in CBF regulation and to afford neuroprotection upon excitation, failed to affect autonomic components of the diving response evoked by forehead cold stimulation or nasal mucosa ammonia stimulation. We conclude that cold stimulation of the forehead triggers physiological response comparable to the response evoked by <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapor</b> instillation into the nasal cavity, which considered as stimulus triggering protective diving response. These observations may explain the neuroprotective effect of the forehead stimulation. Data demonstrate that subthalamic vasodilator area does not directly participate in the autonomic adjustments accompanying diving response, however, it is involved in diving-evoked modulation of EEG.
