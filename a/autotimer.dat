This paperpresents an off-grid system development for house car porchlighting system. Development {{of the system is}} composed ofphotovoltaic panel, environmental sensors, charge controller,battery and lighting loads such as florescent lamp. The off-gridsystem focuses to supply electricity in small scale which isintegrated with some energy saving characteristics. An <b>autotimer</b> and smart charge controller is integrated into the off-gridsystem to turn-on and turn-off the lighting at the house carpouch. Integration of some smart functions is an ideal solutionfor small scale electricity supply or particularly for locationwhich cannot be accessed by grid supply...|$|E
