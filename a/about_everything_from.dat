Described as an [...] "idiot savant", he is characterized as a conspiracy theorist who experiences paranoia <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> dentists to toothpaste companies. He frequently communicates through [...] "head-scratching non sequiturs", leading the characters to perceive him as [...] "operat on a whole other level... and sometimes on a whole other planet". Vieluf said the character was pitched as [...] "the only guy on the show" [...] and [...] "the luckiest guy in the world".|$|E

500|$|The Programme was {{initially}} hesitant about producing the Manual, which promised to draw even more war resisters and publicity to it. [...] "The [...] didn't even {{want me to}} write it", Satin says. [...] "I wrote it at night, in the SUPA office, three or four nights a week after counseling guys and gals 8 to 10 hours a day– pounded it out in several drafts over several months on SUPA's ancient Underwood typewriter." [...] When it finally appeared, some leading periodicals helped {{put it on the}} map. [...] For example, The New York Review of Books called it [...] "useful", and The New York Times said it contains advice <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> how to qualify as an immigrant to jobs, housing, schools, politics, culture, and even the snow. [...] After the war, sociologist John Hagan found that {{more than a third of}} young American emigrants to Canada had read the Manual while still in the United States, and nearly another quarter obtained it after they arrived.|$|E
500|$|Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post {{called the}} episode [...] "deeply unsettling" [...] on purpose. She said that [...] "Violence against women was inescapable in this episode, but what made Mad Mens {{exploration}} of the topic worthwhile and compelling {{was the fact that}} two women in this episode asserted their power and control over their lives. It wasn't a story about helplessness and victimization; it was an episode <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> sweaty discomfort to outright terror, and how we deal with those emotions." [...] John Swansburg, writing for Slate, said the episode was a [...] "dud," [...] with the fever dream a [...] "very obvious (and not particularly enlightening) way to depict Don wrestling with his infidelity issues." [...] Jordan Bartel of the Baltimore Sun compared [...] "Mystery Date" [...] to a Stephen King novel. Meredith Blake of the Los Angeles Times admitted that the dream sequence was [...] "heavy-handed" [...] but that [...] "there’s also something terribly convincing about the link 'Mystery Date' posits between Don’s seemingly insatiable sexual appetite and his personal demons. If only these things dissipated as easily as a fever." [...] Rolling Stone writer Sarene Leeds praised Christina Hendricks' performance and the dream sequence, asking [...] "even though it wasn't [...] "real," [...] what makes Don Draper any different from Richard Speck, the student-nurse murderer?" ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Voliminal was mixed. The newspaper Dawn called the DVD [...] "an audible treat for thrash and speed metal fans", {{he went on}} to compliment drummer Joey Jordison, stating that he [...] "structures his beats and percussions in a very traditional thrash set-up, almost as well as (dare I say it) the great Dave Lombardo of Slayer fame". Ultimate Guitar called the DVD [...] "behind-the-scene action in an unorthodox format, complete with choppy editing and absolutely no specific chronology". They would go on to state though the DVD [...] "only gives partial attention to the music", [...] "The best moment in the 2-disc collection comes during a chat with Corey Taylor, who shares his feelings <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> his less-than-perfect relationship with his father to the obstacles that the band faced in its early days". TuneLab wrote [...] "Slipknot takes a unique approach to their latest film, as they turn {{what could have been a}} mundane video of live footage and band antics into a rather peculiar and extremely interesting movie". The [...] "scatterbrained and choppy" [...] style of Voliminal [...] " [...] the viewer to feel like he or she is [...] "outside looking in", rather than being truly involved with the band's happenings". Reviewing for Blogcritics, Chris Beaumont wrote [...] " [...] was enthralled and bored by the documentary". He went on to state, [...] "the best part is watching them perform", despite the [...] "audio is near unlistenable"; [...] "these guys know their way around the stage...this shows the whole package". Reviewing for Billboard, Christa Titus criticized the DVD writing it [...] "randomly [...] footage from concerts and the usual backstage antics with images of pigeons and overflowing toilets, then tossing in whatever visual effects struck M. Shawn Crahan's fancy while he edited it." [...] She concluded [...] "Save your cash for the band's next tour...that's where you'll get your money's worth". Film School Rejects's Cole Abaius wrote of the DVD, [...] ", probably no one else will purchase or enjoy this DVD". He added that with no narration, [...] "the images are left to speak for themselves", only [...] "some just don’t speak loudly enough". Despite the mixed reviews, Voliminal was certified gold in Australia, platinum in the United States, and double platinum in Canada. The album peaked at the 5th spot on Billboards Music Video charts, and remained on the chart for 10 weeks.|$|E

5000|$|The fourth {{track on}} the album, [...] "Providence", was {{recorded}} live at Palace Theatre, Providence, Rhode Island, USA, on 30 June 1974, {{and is the}} album's only live recording. Charles Snider refers to the album as a [...] "swan song", and comments that [...] "'Providence' packs just <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> improv-related <b>from</b> the last two albums into its eight short minutes." [...] A longer, unedited version of the track was first available on the live four-CD set The Great Deceiver and later added as a bonus track to the album itself for its release {{as part of the}} band's 40th Anniversary Series.|$|R

2500|$|The region's {{most popular}} park, Finlay Park has hosted just <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> festivals and {{political}} rallies to road races and Easter Sunrise services. This [...] park {{has had two}} lives; first dedicated in 1859 as Sidney Park, {{named in honor of}} Algernon Sidney Johnson, a Columbia City Councilman, the park experienced an illustrious but short tenure. The park fell into disrepair after the Civil War and served as a site for commercial ventures until the late 20th century. In 1990, the park was reopened. [...] It serves as the site for such events as Kids Day, The Summer Concert Series, plus many more activities. In 1992, the park was renamed Finlay Park, in honor of Kirkman Finlay, a past mayor of Columbia who had a vision to reenergize the historic Congaree Vista district, between Main Street and the river, and recreate the site that was formerly known as Sidney Park.|$|E
2500|$|Salsa lyrics often {{quote from}} {{traditional}} Cuban sones and rumbas. Sometimes there are references to Afro-Cuban religions, such as Santeria, even by {{artists who are}} not themselves practitioners of the faith. Salsa lyrics also exhibit Puerto Rican influences. Hector LaVoe, who sang with Willie Colón {{for nearly a decade}} used typical Puerto Rican phrasing in his singing. It's not uncommon now to hear the Puerto Rican declamatory exclamation [...] "le-lo-lai" [...] in salsa. Politically and socially activist composers have long been an important part of salsa, and some of their works, like Eddie Palmieri's [...] "La libertad - lgico," [...] became Latin, and especially Puerto Rican anthems. The Panamanian-born singer Ruben Blades in particular is well known for his socially-conscious and incisive salsa lyrics <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> imperialism to disarmament and environmentalism, which have resonated with audiences throughout Latin America. Many salsa songs contain a nationalist theme, centered around a sense of pride in black Latino identity, and may be in Spanish, English or a mixture of the two called Spanglish.|$|E
2500|$|Gould {{suffered}} many {{pains and}} ailments, {{though he was}} something of a hypochondriac (admitting it himself on at least one occasion), and his autopsy revealed few underlying problems in areas that often troubled him. He was highly concerned about his health throughout his life, worrying <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> high blood pressure (which in his later years he recorded in diary form) to the safety of his hands. (Gould rarely shook hands with anyone and usually wore gloves.) As mentioned above, early in his life Gould had suffered a spine injury. His physicians prescribed, usually independently, an assortment of analgesics, anxiolytics, and other drugs. Bazzana has speculated that Gould's increasing use of a variety of prescription medicines over his career may have had a deleterious effect on his health. It reached the stage, Bazzana writes, that [...] "he was taking pills to counteract the side effects of other pills, creating a cycle of dependency". It has been debated whether Gould's mind fell within the autism spectrum. The diagnosis was first suggested by psychiatrist Peter Ostwald, a friend of Gould's, in the 1997 book Glenn Gould: The Ecstasy and Tragedy of Genius.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{seeks to}} {{document}} {{and examine the}} Iraqi people’s exercise {{of their right to}} protest and the influence these protests have had on the political landscape of the post-Saddam era. Since 2003, the Iraqi people have frequently taken to the streets en masse, to air their concerns <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> – <b>from</b> the ongoing US-led occupation to the government’s failure to provide basic security and infrastructure and to the airing of ‘indecent’ programmss on Iraqi television. This paper concludes by arguing that Iraqi citizens who play an active role in their own governance and participate in democratic mechanisms such as elections and mass demonstrations are helping to create a more robust democracy...|$|R

He explained; [...] "It's more than just a song about a love for your woman; it's <b>about</b> love for <b>everything,</b> <b>from</b> the Earth, to your friends, and even your enemies."

2500|$|Davis and Wyler {{frequently}} fought during filming, <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> {{her appearance}} (Wyler {{thought she looked}} like a Kabuki performer, but Davis wanted to look older than her age as the part was written for a 40-year-old) to the set design (which Davis thought was far too opulent for a family supposedly struggling financially) to her interpretation of the role (Wyler wanted a more feminine and sympathetic Regina, akin to Tallulah's interpretation). Davis had yielded to Wyler's demands during production of The Letter, but this time she held her ground. Not helping the situation was the fact Los Angeles was experiencing its worst heat wave in years, and the temperature on the soundstages regularly rose above 100 degrees. Davis finally walked off the picture. [...] "It was the only time in my career that I walked out on a film after the shooting had begun," [...] she later recalled. [...] "I was a nervous wreck {{due to the fact that}} my favorite and most admired director was fighting me every inch of the way ... I just didn't want to continue." [...] The actress retreated to her rented house in Laguna Beach and [...] "flatly refused to come back to work. It took a little courage, to say the least. Goldwyn had it in his power to sue me for the entire cost of the production." [...] A week later she returned to the set after rumors she would be replaced by Katharine Hepburn or Miriam Hopkins began to circulate, although Goldwyn was not about to bear the expense of scrapping all the footage with Davis and refilming the scenes with a new actress. Even though the film was a critical and commercial success and nominated for nine Academy Awards, she and Wyler never worked together again.|$|E

6000|$|Pepys began {{life in a}} {{small way}} as a clerk in a {{government}} office, but soon rose by his diligence and industry to be Secretary of the Admiralty. Here he was brought into contact with every grade of society, from the king's ministers to the poor sailors of the fleet. Being inquisitive as a blue jay, he investigated the rumors and gossip of the court, as well as the small affairs of his neighbors, and wrote them all down in his diary with evident interest. But because he chattered most freely, and told his little book a great many secrets which it were not well for the world to know, he concealed everything in shorthand,--and here again he was like the blue jay, which carries off and hides every bright trinket it discovers. The Diary covers the years from 1660 to 1669, and gossips <b>about</b> <b>everything,</b> <b>from</b> his own position and duties at the office, his dress and kitchen and cook and children, to the great political intrigues of office and the scandals of high society. No other such minute-picture of the daily life of an age has been written. Yet for {{a century and a half}} it remained entirely unknown, and not until 1825 was Pepys's shorthand deciphered and published. Since then it has been widely read, and is still one of the most interesting examples of diary writing that we possess. Following are a few extracts,[181] covering only a few days in April, 1663, from which one may infer the minute and interesting character of the work that this clerk, politician, president of the Royal Society, and general busybody wrote to please himself: ...|$|E

5000|$|His {{only other}} major {{contribution}} was Pauvre Lampil ("Poor Lampil"), {{a series of}} short humoristic semi-autobiographic stories, satirizing the hard life of a comics artist and his writing partner [...] - [...] caricatures of Lambil and Cauvin themselves [...] - [...] as they argue <b>about</b> almost <b>everything,</b> <b>from</b> work to life in general. The strip is also a domestic one {{in the style of}} Blondie with the ever-depressed Lampil having to put up with everything life throws at him, which is not helped by the more cheery dispositions of his wife and their son Joel. The strip also features caricatures of other comics artists like André Franquin and Jean-Claude Fournier. In his early appearances, Lampil's comic strip is described as Panty et son kangourou ("Panty and his Kangaroo") which only has a moderate success, but latter ones had him and Cauvin actually working on Les Tuniques Bleues.|$|R

50|$|Another {{significant}} trend regarding {{future of}} advertising {{is the growing}} importance of the niche market using niche or targeted ads. Also {{brought about by the}} Internet and the theory of the long tail, advertisers will have an increasing ability to reach specific audiences. In the past, {{the most efficient way to}} deliver a message was to blanket the largest mass market audience possible. However, usage tracking, customer profiles and the growing popularity of niche content brought <b>about</b> by <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> blogs to social networking sites, provide advertisers with audiences that are smaller but much better defined, leading to ads that are more relevant to viewers and more effective for companies' marketing products. Among others, Comcast Spotlight is one such advertiser employing this method in their video on demand menus. These advertisements are targeted to a specific group and can be viewed by anyone wishing to find out more about a particular business or practice, from their home. This causes the viewer to become proactive and actually choose what advertisements they want to view.|$|R
