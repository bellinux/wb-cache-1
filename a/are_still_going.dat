Cowans Sheldon {{originated in the}} city in the mid 19th century and became one of the world's most important railway and marine engineering firms, manufacturing finally ceased in Carlisle in 1987. The Carr's and Metal Box factories <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>going.</b> The construction firm of John Laing and the hauliers Eddie Stobart Ltd. were also founded in Carlisle.

500|$|Most critics' praise went to Robin Williams' {{performance}} as Genie, with Janet Maslin of The New York Times declaring that children [...] "needn't know precisely what Mr. Williams is evoking {{to understand how}} funny he is." [...] Warner Bros. Cartoons director Chuck Jones even called the film [...] "the funniest feature ever made." [...] Furthermore, English-Irish comedian Spike Milligan considered {{it to be the}} greatest film of all time. James Berardinelli gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the [...] "crisp visuals and wonderful song-and-dance numbers." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said the comedy made the film accessible to both children and adults, a vision shared with Desson Howe of The Washington Post, who also said [...] "kids <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> to be entranced by the magic and adventure." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety praised the cast of characters, describing the expressive magic carpet as [...] "its most remarkable accomplishment" [...] and considered that [...] "Aladdin overcomes most story flaws thanks to sheer technical virtuosity." ...|$|E
500|$|After Mal and Peter Asher (A head of Apple Records) saw {{the rock}} band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal {{constantly}} {{suggested that the}} Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ... I thought I was different from other people in my relationship with The Beatles and being loved by them and treated so nice, I felt {{like one of the}} family. Seems I fetch and carry. I find it difficult to live on the £38 I take home each week and would love to be like their other friends who buy fantastic homes and have all the alterations done by them, and <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> to ask for a rise. I always tell myself—look, everybody wants to take from, be satisfied, try to give and you will receive. After all this time I have about £70 to my name, but was content and happy. Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?" [...] Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: [...] "April 24: [...] "Had to tell George —'I'm broke'. Really miserable and down because I'm in the red, and the bills are coming in, poor old Lil [...] suffers as I don't want to get a rise. Not really true don't want to ask for a rise, fellows are having a pretty tough time as it is." ...|$|E

It doesn't seem like a crazy price to me. But again, I have no idea what the proper margins are. If someone is saying 'What am I going to buy this month?' in November, I hope that our game is the one they pick out, because we're offering something that nothing else on the market is. But if they don't, I totally understand. There's a lot of really cool stuff. What I'm hoping is that as time goes on...

60|$|This fact explains, also, why in mines of wood-coal {{carbonic}} acid, i.e. choke-damp, {{alone is}} given off. For in the wood-coal {{a great deal}} of the hydrogen still remains. In mines of true coal, not only is choke-damp given off, but that more terrible pest of the miners, fire-damp, or explosive carburetted hydrogen and olefiant gases. Now the occurrence of that fire-damp in mines proves that changes <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> on in the coal: that it is getting rid of its hydrogen, and so progressing toward the state of anthracite or culm--stone-coal as it is sometimes called. In the Pennsylvanian coal-fields some of the coal has actually done this, under the disturbing force of earthquakes; for the coal, which is bituminous, like our common coal, to the westward where the strata are horizontal, becomes gradually anthracite as it is tossed and torn by the earthquake faults of the Alleghany and Appalachian mountains.|$|E

60|$|Whilst these proofs were in {{the press}} a second very marked case of a Polter-geist came within my knowledge. I cannot without breach of {{confidence}} reveal the details and the phenomena <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>going</b> on. Curiously enough, it was {{because one of the}} sufferers from the invasion read some remarks of mine upon the Cheriton dugout that this other case came to my knowledge, for the lady wrote to me at once for advice and assistance. The place is remote and I have not yet been able to visit it, but from the full accounts which I have now received it seems to present all the familiar features, with the phenomenon of direct writing superadded. Some specimens of this script have reached me. Two clergymen have endeavoured to mitigate the phenomena, which are occasionally very violent, but so far without result. It may be some consolation to any others who may be suffering from this strange infliction, to know that in the many cases which have been carefully recorded there is none in which any physical harm has been inflicted upon man or beast.|$|E

There are a great many of the latter coming up--the hospitals here are quite full--lately they have [been] picking out in the hospitals all that had pretty well recovered, and sending them back to their regiments. They seem to be determined to strengthen the army this spring to the utmost. They are sending down many to their reg'ts that are not fit to go in my opinion--then there are squads and companies, and reg'ts, too, passing through here in one steady stream, going down to the front, returning from furlough home; but then there are quite a number leaving the army on furlough, re-enlisting, and going North for a while. They pass through here quite largely. Mother, Lewis Brown is getting quite well; he will soon {{be able to have a}} wooden leg put on.
