5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, LucasArts tasked Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer, {{both of whom}} had worked on the Monkey Island series, with {{designing}} a sequel to Maniac Mansion. Gilbert and Winnick initially assisted with the project's writing. The team included voice acting and more detailed graphics, which Gilbert had originally envisioned for Maniac Mansion. The first game's nonlinear design was discarded, and the team implemented <b>a</b> <b>Chuck</b> Jones-inspired visual style, alongside numerous puzzles based on time travel. Bernard and the Edison family were retained. The sequel, entitled Day of the Tentacle, was released in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Because its {{coloration}} {{is similar}} to Bendire's thrasher, the two birds are easily mistaken for one another. The bill of the curve-billed is all black, while that of Bendire's is paler down to the lower mandible, showing a dark grey with a basal area that does not feature a stark contrast. The upper and lower mandibles of the curve-billed are curved, while the upper is curved and lower is essentially straight for the Bendires'. Although geographic variances for the curve-billed can make discerning breast patterns difficult, the curve-billed {{has a tendency to}} display larger and rounder spots overall on its breast, in contrast to the Bendires' smaller, more pronounced markings shaped like arrowheads. However, curve-billed thrashers can also present this feature. Bendires' typically have yellow eyes while curve-billed eyes are typically orange, but Bendires' can have variations that appear yellow-orange while some curve-billed eyes are red-orange, yellow-orange, or yellow. The curve-billed is heavier and is more likely to inhabit suburban regions; Bendires' are likely to avoid dense vegetation such as mesquite and prefers open grassland with scattered yucca or around hedgegrows in agricultural areas. The song call of Bendire's is said to be more melodic and continuous with <b>a</b> <b>chuck,</b> while the curve-billed is known for its whit-wheet calls.|$|E

40|$|Significant {{improvements}} {{have been}} made in the performance of CNC machine tools due to the active research over the last several decades. However, the research and understanding on chucking accuracy have not been adequate. Nor has any systematic methods been reported for on chucking accuracy, especially in terms of the repeatability and the accuracy in the position of <b>a</b> <b>chucked</b> workpiece. The needs for the improvements in chucking accuracy has been existed since chucking has been the bottleneck in the form accuracy of a workpiece as the accuracy of machine tools improved significantly over the last several decades. However, the need was not very strong since turning has not been considered as the finishing process for the production of precision mechanical components such as bearings and shafts. After recent studies have demonstrated the benefits of hard turning in terms of surface integrity over other abrasive machining processes as a finishing process, a strong need emerged to improve chucking accuracy to enable the implementation of finish hard turning for the production of precision mechanical components. In this study, systematic methods for improving the accuracy and repeatability in the position of <b>a</b> <b>chucked</b> workpiece have been sought. Factors affecting the positioning accuracy and repeatability of <b>a</b> <b>chucked</b> workpiece have been identified. In addition, the characteristics of these factors, as well as their effect on chucking accuracy, were given. From the results, <b>a</b> <b>chucking</b> error map that summarizes the relations between these factors and the positioning erro...|$|R

25|$|In industry, {{virtually}} all drilling {{is done by}} automated machines, and the bits are often automatically replaced by the equipment as they wear, as even solid carbide bits do not last long in constant use. PCB bits, of narrow diameter, typically mount in a collet rather than <b>a</b> <b>chuck,</b> and come with standard-size shanks, often with pre-installed stops to set them at an exact depth every time when being automatically chucked by the equipment.|$|E
25|$|On average, {{a single}} herd of cattle on a drive {{numbered}} about 3,000 head. To herd the cattle, {{a crew of}} at least 10 cowboys was needed, with three horses per cowboy. Cowboys worked in shifts to watch the cattle 24 hours a day, herding them in the proper direction in the daytime and watching them at night to prevent stampedes and deter theft. The crew also included a cook, who drove <b>a</b> <b>chuck</b> wagon, usually pulled by oxen, and a horse wrangler {{to take charge of}} the remuda, or herd of spare horses. The wrangler on a cattle drive was often a very young cowboy or one of lower social status, but the cook was a particularly well-respected member of the crew, as not only was he in charge of the food, he also was in charge of medical supplies and had a working knowledge of practical medicine.|$|E

500|$|After {{settling}} in London in 1965, Epstein rented {{an office in}} Monmouth Street, and later bought the lease of the Saville Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue. He promoted new works by writers such as Arnold Wesker, in productions that occasionally fell foul of the Lord Chamberlain for including [...] "obscene" [...] content or nudity. In 1966 Epstein reinvented it as a music venue featuring various US acts. On 20 February 1967, Epstein sacked {{the manager of the}} theatre, one Michael Bullock, for lowering the safety curtain the previous day shortly before the end of <b>a</b> <b>Chuck</b> Berry concert that Epstein was attending with Lennon and Starr. Two fans had climbed onto the stage to dance, the curtain came down, and they were pushed from the stage. Although Bullock had not given the order, he was held responsible.|$|E
500|$|Loter {{typically}} visualized whatever script he {{was provided}} with {{after they had}} been written. With characters drawn with large heads and eyes, the show's colorful, [...] "hip and retro" [...] style is reminiscent of [...] "campy" [...] spy films released during the 1960s and 1970s. The New York Times observed that the show's retro setting is more {{similar to that of}} The Jetsons than The Simpsons. Using a limited animation style, the characters wear a wide variety of costumes and hairstyles. Opting for a [...] "simplicity that was the hallmark of" [...] the 1960s, some of the architecture in Kim Possible is reminiscent of lairs owned by James Bond villains, while Bodner was inspired by the graphic design of posters Disney used during the same decade, as well <b>a</b> <b>Chuck</b> Jones and Maurice Noble. In Season 4, some episodes were intentionally filmed in multiplane to achieve a more cinematic image. Additionally, Disney Channel's animated series [...] inspired the animators and artists to approach Kim Possibles final season with an [...] "edgier" [...] design. Director Steve Loter declared Season 4 the series [...] "most international season" [...] because Kim and Ron travel to more exotic countries. Three different animation studios animated the series: Rough Draft, Starburst and Hanho.|$|E
2500|$|Single-point threading, also colloquially called single-pointing (or just {{thread cutting}} when the context is implicit), is an {{operation}} that uses a single-point tool to produce a thread form on a cylinder or cone. The tool moves [...] while the precise rotation of the workpiece determines {{the lead of the}} thread. The process can be done to create external or internal threads (male or female). In external thread cutting, the piece can either be held in <b>a</b> <b>chuck</b> or mounted between two centers. With internal thread cutting, the piece is held in <b>a</b> <b>chuck.</b> The tool moves across the piece linearly, taking chips off the workpiece with each pass. Usually 5 to 7 light cuts create the correct depth of the thread.|$|E

The remaining songs are largely of the same bleak tone, including the dark [...] "State Trooper", influenced by Suicide's [...] "Frankie Teardrop". Criminal behavior continues as a theme in the song [...] "Highway Patrolman": even though the protagonist works for the law, he lets his brother escape after he has shot someone.

2500|$|The era also {{provided}} {{some of the}} greatest advances in rapping technique. Kool G Rap, referring to the golden age in the book How to Rap said, [...] "that era bred rappers like a Big Daddy Kane, a KRS-One, a Rakim, <b>a</b> <b>Chuck</b> D... their rapping capability and ability– these dudes were phenomenal". Many of hip hop's biggest artists were also at their creative peak. Allmusic said the golden age [...] "witnessed the best recordings from some of the biggest rappers in the genre's history... overwhelmingly based in New York City, golden age rap is characterized by skeletal beats, samples cribbed from hard rock or soul tracks, and tough dis raps... rhymers like PE's Chuck D, Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One, Rakim, and LL Cool J basically invented the complex wordplay and lyrical kung-fu of later hip-hop".|$|E

2500|$|In November 1964, {{the group}} was poised to make their American debut on The Ed Sullivan Show and begin a short {{residency}} performing regularly in theatres across New York City. The group arrived in New York City direct from John F. Kennedy International Airport in a motorcade formed of Sunbeam Alpine Series IV convertibles, with each car featuring a band member riding with a fashion model {{in the back seat}} and the rooftop down. The group drove to their hotel accompanied by the occasional shrieks of girls who had chased them down once they discovered who they were. The Animals sang [...] "I'm Crying" [...] and [...] "The House of the Rising Sun" [...] to a packed audience of hysterical girls screaming throughout both performances on Sullivan's show. In December, the MGM movie Get Yourself a College Girl was released with the Animals headlining with the Dave Clark Five.

2500|$|The first lineup {{comprised}} Gibbons {{together with}} Dave Carroll and Bob Wilson on guitars, Trevor Burton on bass and Bob Lamb on drums. The new band worked the pub and club circuits until 1975 {{when they were}} spotted by Peter Meaden, former manager of The Who. This led to the Steve Gibbons Band joining The Who's management stable and recording their first Polydor album Any Road Up in 1975 (With John Entwistle of The Who playing on a few tracks). This was followed in 1976 by a tour with The Who in the UK, Europe and the United States. Playing the concert arenas, they shared the stage with Little Feat, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Electric Light Orchestra, The J. Geils Band, Rufus, and Nils Lofgren. In 1977 their second album, Rollin' On included their biggest hit single, [...] "Tulane", a cover of <b>a</b> <b>Chuck</b> Berry song.
