40|$|Food {{entrepreneurs}} {{have two}} ways to produce foods for sale to consumers in Indiana. Some limited types of foods can be produced in a home kitchen if those foods qualify under the homebased vendor rule (see Using a Home Kitchen to Prepare Food for Sale, Purdue Extension publication FS- 18 -W). But entrepreneurs who wish to sell foods that don’t qualify for this exemption will {{need to work with}} an approved kitchen facility. Where does an Indiana entrepreneur find an approved kitchen facility to produce the food product they wish to sell? That depends on the type of food product and the selling location. Entrepreneurs who want to market to a larger customer base with a wider variety of products than the home-based vendor exemption allows must manufacture their products in an <b>approved</b> <b>facility</b> separate from a home kitchen. An <b>approved</b> <b>facility</b> is one that is inspected either by the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) or by one of the 93 local health departments (www. in. gov/isdh/ 24822. htm). Retail food businesses not on state property are inspected by the local county health department. Retail food businesses on state property and food wholesalers are inspected by the ISDH. Retail food sales are those sold directly to a consumer by the processor or distributor, such as at restaurants, grocery stores, festivals, fairs, and carnivals, and through Internet sales.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Drugs {{of abuse}} elevate brain {{dopamine}} levels, and, in vivo, chronic {{drug use is}} accompanied by a selective decrease in dopamine D 2 receptor (D 2 R) availability in the brain. Such a decrease consequently alters the ratio of D 1 R:D 2 R signaling towards the D 1 R. Despite a plethora of behavioral studies dedicated {{to the understanding of the}} role of dopamine in addiction, a molecular mechanism responsible for the downregulation of the D 2 R, in vivo, in response to chronic drug use has yet to be identified. METHODS AND FINDINGS: ETHICS STATEMENT: All animal work was approved by the Gallo Center IACUC committee and was performed in our AAALAC <b>approved</b> <b>facility.</b> In this study, we used wild type (WT) and G protein coupled receptor associated sorting protein- 1 (GASP- 1) knock out (KO) mice to assess molecular changes that accompany cocaine sensitization. Here, we show that downregulation of D 2 Rs or upregulation of D 1 Rs is associated with a sensitized locomotor response to an acute injection of cocaine. Furthermore, we demonstrate that disruption of GASP- 1, that targets D 2 Rs for degradation after endocytosis, prevents cocaine-induced downregulation of D 2 Rs. As a consequence, mice with a GASP- 1 disruption show a reduction in the sensitized locomotor response to cocaine. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our data suggests that changes in the ratio of the D 1 :D 2 R could contribute to cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity and demonstrates a role of GASP- 1 in regulating both the levels of the D 2 R and cocaine sensitization...|$|E
40|$|Our {{objectives}} were {{to compare the}} prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in 103 women undergoing induced legal abortion (LA) and in 101 women with confirmed, recent illegal abortion (IA), in Maputo, Mozambique. For {{the purpose of this}} study, LA was considered the abortion provided in the Maputo Central Hospital with the approval of the Ministry of Health, and IA the one not provided through the <b>approved</b> <b>facility,</b> mentioned above. Women with IA were recruited in the outpatient gynaecology ward and women with LA in the emergency gynaecology ward in the Maputo Central Hospital, during the same time period. Serological tests for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin, ELISA-IgC and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption), gonorrhoea (indirect haemagglutination) and chlamydia (microimmunofluorescence) were carried out. Direct immuno-fluorescence for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis antigen was done on endocervical smears from all the women. The prevalence of syphilis seropositivity in IA women is twice that of LA women (odds ratio [OR] 2. 13; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 55 - 9. 95), with 10. 9 % and 4. 9 %, respectively. Exposure to gonorrhoea in these 2 groups is similar (OR 1. 18; 95 % CI 0. 63 - 2. 20), with seroprevalence of 31. 1 % in the LA and 34. 7 % in the IA group. The high titres are also similar in both groups. Serology findings for C. trachomatis indicate prevalence of seropositivity of 40. 6 % in the LA and 44. 4 % in the IA group with no significant difference (OR 1. 17; 95 % CI 0. 64 - 2. 13). In conclusion, STIs are highly prevalent in both IA and LA groups in Maputo. Urgent interventions are needed to reduce their prevalence and consequently their adverse consequences...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, Dengue fever is one ofthe major {{epidemic}} {{diseases in}} urban, semi-urban, {{and rural areas}} in tropical and subtropical countries. This mosquito transmitted viral disease is considered as fastest transmitted mosquito disease and spread in over 100 countries. Based on WHO report in 2 QI 0, Southeast Asia (SEA) and Western Pacific (WP) regions bear nearly 75 % of current disease population. This disease is transmitted using two species of mosquitoes, the main vector Aedes aegypti (L.) and the less competent vector A. albopictus. For many years, controlling dengue disease is carried out through killing the mosquito larvae. This is usually carried out by using chemical methods which cause many enviromnental problems and human and animal toxicity. Another approach was developed by using the biological control agent Bacillus thuringiensisI var israelensis as specific and safe larvicidal agent. However, after many years application, some resistance varieties were developed and thus decrease the agent efficiency. More recently, based on the many years and innovative research in University of Florida in USA, a newly discovered protein called Trypsin Modulating Oostatic Factor (TMOF) showed strong larvicidal activity in aquatic Enviromnent. TMOF consist of 10 amino acid sequence ofthe hormone (YDPAPPPPPP) kuown as mosquito decapeptide. The hormone synthesized by the ovaries after the blood meal, circulates in the hemolymph, binds to gut receptor and stops trypsin biosynthesis. A unique primary and stable amino acid from gut proteolytic enzymes that can interferes with digestion of mosquito larvae, leading to their starvation by termination of trypsin biosynthesis in their midgut. No harm to humans or the enviromnent is expected from use of TMOF as a pesticide active ingredient. The genes for making TMOF have been inserted into yeast cells (Pichia pastoris) so the yeast cells make large amounts of the protein. The yeast cells are then killed by exposure to extremely high temperatures. Killed yeast cells containing TMOF are applied to bodies of water to control mosquito larvae. Once eaten by mosquito larvae, TMOF interferes with the production of trypsin, a critical enzyme needed by the larval digestive system. Exposed larvae are unable to digest food and therefore starve to death. Since late 2008, Institute of Bioproduct Development (IBD) at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) is working in long term strategic partner for EntoGenex Co. (the TMOF technology owner) for technology transfer, bioprocess development, large scale production, and final product formulation. The IBD bioprocessing microbial platform is a complete integrated upstream/downstream platform to complete the process and production chain from microbe vial to finished product. IBD is currently the first and biggest bioprocessing facilities among Malaysian universities and the currently the only <b>approved</b> <b>facility</b> by Genetic Modification Advisory Committee (GMAC) under the Biosafety Act 2007 for running living modified organism (LMO) for large scale production up to 1500 L fermentation capacity. The current presentation, will present the successful story of cooperation between IBD and biotechnology companies to produce highly demanded high technology product to solve big • health problem in National, regional, and international agenda. At first, IBD was worked as technology transfer hub and cell banking of the recombinant strain and improved the process oflarge scale production ofTMOF by recombinant P. pastoris.

Third, IBD acted as final product formulation laboratory for the production ofwetable powder form and rice husk based formula for field trial.
