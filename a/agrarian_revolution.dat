40|$|Peasant {{revolutions}} in {{the twentieth}} century {{played a major role in}} shaping the course of world history. Peasants, identi¢ed by Marx as a species facing extinction in the face of rapid industrialization, in fact became one of the primary forces of social change in this century. This research re£ects the recent trends in scholarship on revolutions. Through the comparative-historical method, it seeks to explain very di¡erent patterns of peasant revolutionary behavior in two revolutions in South China between 1926 and 1934. In the case of Hunan, peasants staged a radical revolution without signi¢cant outside mobilization. In the case of Jiangxi, peasants remained politically passive even under very intense mobilization from Mao Tse-tung 2 ̆ 7 s Red Army. Following the recent movement away from materialistic and instrumentalist perspectives, which tend to emphasize factors such as economic systems, class relations, and rational choice, this research argues that the cause of di¡erent revolutionary patterns in Hunan and Jiangxilies in the legitimacy of organizational structures of rural communities. <b>Agrarian</b> <b>revolutions</b> could happen when peasants attempt to overthrow the illegitimate communal organizational frameworks...|$|R

Hume was disappointed when Congress opposed moves to raise the age of marriage for Indian girls and failed to focus on issues of poverty.

In 1892, he tried to get them to act by warning of a violent <b>agrarian</b> <b>revolution</b> but this only outraged the British establishment and frightened the Congress leaders. Disappointed by the continued lack of Indian leaders willing to work for the cause of national emancipation, Hume left for Britain in 1894.|$|E

2500|$|In retrospect, the {{majority}} of Leskov's legacy, documentary in essence, {{could be seen as}} part of the 19th century raznochintsy literature which relied upon the 'real life sketch' as a founding genre. But, while Gleb Uspensky, Vasily Sleptsov and Fyodor Reshetnikov were preaching [...] "the urgent need to study the real life of the common people," [...] Leskov was caustic in his scorn: [...] "Never could I understand this popular idea among our publicists of 'studying' the life of the common people, for I felt it would be more natural for a writer to 'live' this kind of life, rather than 'study' it," [...] he remarked. With his thorough knowledge of the Russian provinces, competence in every nuance of the industrial, agricultural and religious spheres, including obscure regional, sectarian or ethnic nuances, Leskov regarded his colleagues on the radical left as cabinet theoreticians, totally rootless in their [...] "studies". Leskov was not indifferent to social injustice, according to Bukhstab. [...] "It was just that he viewed social problems as a strict practitioner for whom only personal experience was worthy of trust while none of the theories based on philosophical doctrines held water. Unlike the Social Democrats, Leskov neither believed in the possibility of an <b>agrarian</b> <b>revolution</b> in Russia, nor wanted it to happen, seeing education and enlightenment, often of religious nature, as the factors for social improvement," [...] wrote the biographer.|$|E

40|$|Premised on {{the belief}} that a social and an {{ecological}} agenda are compatible, this collection offers readings in the ecology of left and radical writing from the Romantic period to the present. While early ecocriticism tended to elide the bitter divisions within and between societies, recent practitioners of ecofeminism, environmental justice, and social ecology have argued that the social, the economic and the environmental have to be seen as part of the same process. Taking up this challenge, the contributors trace the origins of an environmental sensibility and of the modern left to their roots in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, charting {{the ways in which the}} literary imagination responds to the political, industrial and <b>agrarian</b> <b>revolutions.</b> Topics include Samuel Taylor Coleridge's credentials as a green writer, the interaction between John Ruskin's religious and political ideas and his changing view of nature, William Morris and the Garden City movement, H. G. Wells and the Fabians, the devastated landscapes in the poetry and fiction of the First World War, and the leftist pastoral poetry of the 1930 s. In historicizing and connecting environmentally sensitive literature with socialist thought, these essays explore the interactive vision of nature and society in the work of writers ranging from William Wordsworth and John Clare to John Berger and John Burnside...|$|R
40|$|As {{early as}} the end of the 1950 s, the need for {{increased}} agricultural production and supply of food to sustain the industrialization process in Less Developed Countries was recognized. This is reflected in the findings that "industrialization depends upon agricultural improvements; " "industrial and <b>agrarian</b> <b>revolutions</b> always go together; " and "economies in which agriculture is stagnant do not show industrial development " (Lewis 1954, p. 173). Agriculture-oriented development strategies received substantial support in the development literature beginning in the 1960 's (Johnson and Mellor, 1961, etc.). Available evidence lends strong support to the close relationship between agricultural development and overall economic growth. Delgado et al (1994), show that an initial increase in rural incomes in a set of African countries is amplified through growth multipliers averaging 2. 0 and above 1. Furthermore, agricultural multiplier estimates obtained by other authors (e. g. Hagggblade et. al. 1989) range from 1. 5 to 2. 7 and are comparable to estimates for Asian countries which range from 1. 5 to 2. 4. Since agriculture provides a third of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employs about two thirds of the labor force, and is in many cases the primary provider of foreign exchange in most African countries, it is unlikely that any significant and sustained recovery of national economies can be achieved, unless countries succeed in reversing the economic decline of the agricultural sector.

40|$|Bolivia {{changed its}} state model in 2006 with the {{entrance}} of Evo Morales to the presidency. He assumed the presidency representing indigenous, peasant and social movements. The country had a new constitution in 2009 that included different cultures and indigenous nations. However, the regulatory framework changed its focus. For instance, in 2011 the Communal <b>Agrarian</b> Productive <b>Revolution</b> law was enacted, so as the Patriotic Agenda 2025 in 2013. The laws carried a new conception of the state related {{to the increase in}} the production and exportation of natural resources. This model has been called “commodities consensus”. With the change of the national state models, there is a change in the relationship of the state with the civil society, and in this specific case of study, in the relationship with the NGOs. Through a qualitative research strategy, the research aims to analyse the agency of Andean agrarian Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in the relationship with Bolivian state’s political models (neoliberalism and post-neoliberal/commodities consensus) during the last 20 years, from 1996 to 2016. The exercise of agency of the NGOs in their relationship with the state has taken two lines: “NGOs agency for reproduction”, applying the demands of the state and global civil society trends, and “NGOs agency for social change”, where NGOs have been working to support indigenous and peasant communities beyond the state. The major example of the exercise of agency for social change was the constitution of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. Currently, in the commodities consensus model, the state enforces NGOs to reproduce the official development model. The state wants to use the NGOs as instruments for its governmentality, with rigid laws that shows a regimen on the path towards authoritarianism...|$|R

40|$|Described by one {{historian}} as the ‘cartographic {{assemblage of}} the globe’, the {{two centuries of}} print revolution and colonial expansion between 1500 and 1700 witnessed an exponential increase in the sophistication, exactitude and proliferation of mapping in Europe.

In the Atlantic archipelago in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the visibility of maps grew significantly. This thesis analyses a wide variety of different textual forms and genres to ask if a narrative of this profusion of cartography can be developed, with its own distinct themes and methodologies of representation. It pays particular attention to mapping moments in texts by major authors such as Francis Bacon, William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. In addition, didactic manuals, mathematical treatises, engravings, pedagogical tracts, colonial narratives, and utopian fiction are all considered with a view to understanding how early modern English culture engaged with the map, its physicality and production...|$|R

40|$|After {{four and}} a half decades of Green <b>Revolution</b> <b>agrarian</b> development, the state of Punjab is now, {{according}} to many commentators, in a state of social, economic and ecological crisis. In this paper, I interpret this crisis through a Gramscian lens as a ‘crisis of authority’, in the sense that while the dominant paradigm (the Green Revolution) can no longer provide solutions to the state 2 ̆ 7 s most pressing social problems, there is no clear single alternative either. This situation provides a political opportunity for non-hegemonic groups to articulate various other possibilities that address fundamental questions. This paper focuses on the work of one such group, the Kheti Virasat Mission (KVM). KVM is a civil society organisation that promotes ‘natural farming’ as a solution to the crisis in Punjab: natural farming is a chemical-free method of farming, which relies exclusively on materials available at the local level. This paper looks at KVM 2 ̆ 7 s methods of intervening in the crisis situation and examines the difficulties faced at the level of implementation. It argues that KVM 2 ̆ 7 s successes and failures highlight the uneven capacities of different classes and social groups to effectively respond to a ‘crisis of authority’...|$|R

Similarly, Japanese influence in Korea, {{and the desire}} of the Japanese to keep Korean labor out of U.S. markets in Hawaii, spurred labor recruiters acting in Korea to contract with over 1000 Korean laborers—196 single men and 257 families—to work in the henequen industry in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. Though some women were tricked into indenture agreements in the Caribbean, most voluntarily went because of poverty or social conditions. The numbers of Chinese women who migrated to Peru and Cuba remained relatively small, but some 250,000 Indian women agreed to indenture contracts, making up 40% of the Indian indentured laborers transported to the Caribbean. They encountered societal and family oppression, poverty, lack of power, sexual abuse and violence during their indenture, but most remained after their contracts were completed.
