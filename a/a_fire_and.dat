5|$|In 1929, the News-Miner was {{purchased}} by Alaska industrialist Austin E. Lathrop, who operated it under a series of editors until 1950. In that year, the paper {{was purchased}} by Charles Willis Snedden, who proceeded on a course of modernization. Under Snedden's leadership, the News-Miner {{became one of the}} first papers in Alaska to print in color and survived <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> the biggest flood in Fairbanks history.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s, Esteban Martínez, {{the parish}} priest of the ruined church, {{approached}} Spanish architect Genaro Palacios {{with a plan}} to build <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> earthquake-resistant structure made entirely of steel. Palacios completed a design that fused Earthquake Baroque with the Neo-Gothic style. His final design was said to have been inspired by the famed Gothic Burgos Cathedral in Burgos, Spain.|$|E

5|$|The {{congregation}} raised $40,000 in 2000 {{for emergency}} repairs, and {{was awarded a}} $230,000 grant by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation for restoration work, including roof repair, but {{had not been able}} to raise the matching funds required to receive the grant. On December 6, 2001, <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> subsequent fire-fighting efforts severely damaged the roof, ceiling, mural paintings and decorative plasterwork.|$|E
5|$|The seat of {{government}} for the state was originally in Philadelphia, then was relocated to Lancaster in 1799 and finally to Harrisburg in 1812. The current capitol, known as the Huston Capitol, is the third state capitol building {{to be built in}} Harrisburg. The first, the Hills Capitol, was destroyed in 1897 by <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> the second, the Cobb Capitol, was left unfinished when funding was discontinued in 1899.|$|E

5|$|At the hotel, James locates a {{videotape}} which depicts him killing his dying wife. At {{this point in}} the game, the letter from Mary is shown to have been a blank piece of paper the entire time. In another room, a final meeting with Angela sees her giving up on life as she is unable to cope with her trauma and guilt any longer. She walks into <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> is not seen again. At this point it is revealed that in Angela's version of Silent Hill the town is always on fire.|$|E
5|$|Brown faced a major prime-ministerial {{challenge}} {{two days}} after entering office, when two unexploded car bombs were discovered in London on 29 June. The following day, a car was driven into {{the entrance of the}} main terminal of Glasgow International Airport in a second apparent terrorist attack, causing <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> considerable damage to the building. Brown was born in Glasgow, leading to speculation that the attacks were motivated against him. As a result of both the London and Glasgow incidents, Brown chaired emergency COBRA meetings to review plans to protect the British public. He also spoke to the First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond regarding the incidents.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{ordered the}} {{refurbishing}} {{of the state}} penitentiary, which had been damaged by <b>a</b> <b>fire,</b> <b>and</b> called for an extensive state geological survey. He also advised {{the creation of a}} sinking fund to retire the state's debt. The state adopted a new constitution during Crittenden's term, though Crittenden was not a delegate to the constitutional convention and apparently had little influence on the drafting of the document. Most Whigs opposed the calling of a constitutional convention because it would necessarily involve reapportionment of the state's legislative districts and threaten Whig dominance in the General Assembly; nevertheless, Crittenden belatedly supported the call for a convention during his 1848 gubernatorial campaign.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>and</b> Rescue Minister {{he worked}} with local <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> rescue {{authorities}} to help prevent deaths, injuries and damage to property. He also worked {{in partnership with the}} <b>Fire</b> <b>and</b> Rescue Service and other agencies to build the resilience and capability to deal with major emergencies, including terrorism and natural disasters. This involved management of a £400m plus technology and change management programme.|$|R

5|$|Following Beckford's {{death in}} 1844, {{the tower and}} lands were donated to Walcot parish and a burial ground created, with the Scarlet Drawing Room being {{converted}} into a chapel. In 1931 the house and tower were damaged by <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> a public appeal was made for funds for its restoration. The cemetery closed in 1992 {{and the next year}} the site was bought by the Bath Preservation Trust who have carried out extensive renovation. It is now home to a museum collection displaying furniture originally made for the tower and paintings, prints and objects illustrating Beckford’s life as a writer, collector and patron of the arts.|$|E
5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the electrical circuits of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives and fireproof casings for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, warning signs were put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing were stolen and the warning signs were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which he had to be rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E

5|$|In April 1766 {{parts of}} the town were {{destroyed}} by <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> the Linnean private collection was subsequently moved to a barn outside the town, and shortly afterwards to a single-room stone building close to his country house at Hammarby near Uppsala. This resulted in a physical separation between the two collections, the museum collection remained in the botanical garden of the university. Some material which needed special care (alcohol specimens) or ample storage space was moved from the private collection to the museum.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{ytterbium}} is {{a mixture}} of seven stable isotopes, which altogether are present at concentrations of 3 parts per million. This element is mined in China, the United States, Brazil, and India in form of the minerals monazite, euxenite, and xenotime. The ytterbium concentration is low because it is found only among many other rare earth elements; moreover, it is among the least abundant. Once extracted and prepared, ytterbium is somewhat hazardous as an eye and skin irritant. The metal is <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> explosion hazard.|$|E
5|$|Philip W. Jaffa, ordained at Hebrew Union College in 1928, joined as rabbi in 1935. He {{adopted the}} Reform Judaism's Union Prayer Book and its {{religious}} school curriculum, and added choir {{music to the}} services. That year much of the synagogue building was destroyed by <b>a</b> <b>fire,</b> <b>and</b> Jaffa's whole library was lost. The congregation re-built the structure, extensively remodeling the sanctuary, and added a religious school building/classroom annex. Jaffa would serve until 1938.|$|E

5|$|The Bellaire Fire Department {{is housed}} at 5101 Jessamine Street. The fire station {{includes}} two fire engines (a main engine and a volunteer/backup engine), two medic units (a main medic unit and a backup unit), an on shift commander vehicle, {{a vehicle for}} each the chief and assistant chief, a cascade unit, and a hazardous materials trailer. The fire department operates the Citizens Fire Academy, <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> life safety program for Bellaire citizens held on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The old fire station was demolished on December 4, 2009, with demolition continuing on Monday December 7, 2009, and operations are temporarily relocated at the Chevron building. A new fire station was scheduled to in {{the location of the}} previous fire station. The groundbreaking for the new station was held on December 17, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} marred by various concerns, notably the safety of Mir {{following}} <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> a collision, financial issues with the cash-strapped Russian Space Program and worries from astronauts about {{the attitudes of the}} program administrators. Nevertheless, a large amount of science, expertise in space station construction and knowledge in working in a cooperative space venture was gained from the combined operations, allowing the construction of the ISS to proceed much more smoothly than would have otherwise been the case.|$|E
5|$|There are {{differences}} between the German and French releases of the film. The character Allan Grey is named David Gray for the German release, which Dreyer attributed to a mistake. The German censors ordered cuts to the film that still exist today in some prints. The scenes {{which had to be}} toned down include the doctor's death under the milled flour and the vampire's death from the stake. There are other scenes that were shot and included in the script that do not exist in any current prints of Vampyr. These scenes reveal the vampire in the factory recoiling against a shadow of a Christian cross as well as a ferryman guiding Gray and Gisèle by getting young children to build <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> sing a hymn to guide them back to the shore.|$|E
