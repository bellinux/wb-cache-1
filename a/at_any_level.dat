5|$|At the {{beginning}} of August, Hansen injured his shoulder and was optioned to Jersey City in favor of Sal Maglie, where he appeared in five games (1–3, 7.31 ERA). After serving seven months in the military, Hansen asked the team to voluntarily retire him in early 1946 due to his father's severe illness. He did not appear in a game <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>level</b> during the 1946 season, but stated {{that he did not}} plan to give up baseball as a career.|$|E
5|$|Hooper {{was born}} in England but has not {{represented}} the national team <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>level.</b> In March 2011 {{it was thought that}} he may be eligible to represent Scotland. However, this possibility was later closed off. Since his move to Celtic he has been considered for England duty and was called up to the under-21 squad for a friendly but had to pull out due to injury. He was then included in the provisional squad for the 2011 European Under-21 Championship but did not go to the tournament.|$|E

5|$|Hooper has not {{represented}} England <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>level.</b> His paternal grandfather William Hooper {{was raised in}} the Scottish Borders, and this led to hopes that Hooper could be eligible to play for Scotland. Then Scotland head coach Craig Levein sought clarification as to the place of birth his grandfather's birth certificate recorded, as he had been born in a hospital in the English border town Berwick-upon-Tweed. The possibility was closed off when it was confirmed that his grandfather was included in the English Births Index. On 13 March 2011, Hooper was included by Stuart Pearce in his 31-man squad for the England under-21 team to play Denmark and Iceland. However, Hooper pulled out of the squad due to injury. On 3 May 2011, he was named in the 40-man provisional squad for the UEFA Under-21 Championship, but did not make the final selection.|$|E
5|$|During the 1999–2000 season, Kariya's {{younger brother}} Steve Kariya began {{playing for the}} Vancouver Canucks. On December 8, 1999, the Ducks and Canucks met for a contest, marking {{the first time that}} the {{brothers}} played against each other <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>level.</b> Steve recorded an assist on the Canucks' first goal of the game, before being called for a penalty. On the ensuing Ducks power play, Kariya scored to tie the game at a final score of 2–2. Later in the season, Kariya was speared by San Jose Sharks defenceman Bryan Marchment during a game in March 2000. Kariya was not injured on the play, though Marchment received a three-game suspension from the NHL. Kariya finished the season with the third-highest goals total of his career with 42, though his points total dipped to 86. Nevertheless, he ranked fourth in League scoring, behind Jaromír Jágr, Pavel Bure and Mark Recchi. In the NHL's season-ending awards, Kariya was named to the NHL Second All-Star Team, having been outvoted for left wing on the First Team by Red Wings forward Brendan Shanahan. He also ranked seventh in Lady Byng voting.|$|E
5|$|On January 18, 2001, the Jets {{announced}} Herman Edwards {{as the new}} coach. Edwards, {{a former}} defensive back who had {{worked his way up}} through the NFL coaching system, had never served as head coach <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>level.</b> He was the first African-American Jets head coach. Edwards lost his first game, two days before the September 11 attacks. In the wake of 9/11, the NFL had to decide whether to play its games the following weekend. Testaverde and the Jets spoke out against playing on the weekend after 9/11, and the Jets were prepared to forfeit the game rather than fly. The NFL decided to move that week's games {{to the end of the}} regular season. The Jets needed to win that game, in Oakland against the Raiders, to reach the playoffs, and John Hall kicked a last-minute 53-yard field goal for a 24–22 victory and a playoff berth. Edwards was the first coach to lead the Jets to the playoffs in his first year with the team. In the playoffs, the Jets again played at Oakland. New York could not stop the Raiders' passing game, and Oakland won, 38–24.|$|E

5|$|Termites are detritivores, {{consuming}} dead plants <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>level</b> of decomposition. They {{also play}} a vital role in the ecosystem by recycling waste material such as dead wood, faeces and plants. Many species eat cellulose, having a specialised midgut that breaks down the fibre. Termites are considered to be a major source (11%) of atmospheric methane, one of the prime greenhouse gases, produced from the breakdown of cellulose. Termites rely primarily upon symbiotic protozoa (metamonads) and other microbes such as flagellate protists in their guts to digest the cellulose for them, allowing them to absorb the end products for their own use. Gut protozoa, such as Trichonympha, in turn, rely on symbiotic bacteria embedded on their surfaces to produce some of the necessary digestive enzymes. Most higher termites, especially in the family Termitidae, can produce their own cellulase enzymes, but they rely primarily upon the bacteria. The flagellates have been lost in Termitidae. Scientists' understanding of the relationship between the termite digestive tract and the microbial endosymbionts is still rudimentary; what is true in all termite species, however, is that the workers feed the other members of the colony with substances derived from the digestion of plant material, either from the mouth or anus. Judging from closely related bacterial species, it is strongly presumed that the termites' and cockroach's gut microbiota derives from their dictyopteran ancestors.|$|E
5|$|The {{court can}} appoint retired judges, lawyers, and other judges to serve {{temporarily}} as judges <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>level</b> in Oregon. They can also appoint senior judges {{to serve on}} any state court at or below {{the highest level of}} court that judge had served on before retirement or resignation. The state supreme court is responsible for admitting new lawyers to practice in Oregon, disciplining attorneys, and appointing members to the Board of Bar Examiners. This board of a minimum of fourteen members is responsible for administering the bar exam and screening prospective lawyers before admitting applicants to practice law in Oregon. Oversight of state judges is also {{in the hands of the}} Supreme Court. The Commission on Judicial Fitness and Disability investigates all reports of abuses and makes recommendations to the Supreme Court on any actions that may need to occur. The Supreme Court can then suspend judges, censure them, remove them from office, or take no action.|$|E
