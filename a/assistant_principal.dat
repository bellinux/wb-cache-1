40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the extent secondary <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> in large Texas high schools demonstrate behaviors consistent with what the literature describes as instructional leadership. Three hundred seventy <b>principals</b> and <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> of large Texas high schools participated in this study. The Principal Instructional Management Rating Scale (Hallinger, 1987) was used to quantify instructional leadership in 10 different job functions. The study found that (a) <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> perceive themselves as exhibiting instructional leadership behaviors at a high frequency, (b) <b>principals</b> perceive their <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> exhibiting instructional leadership behaviors at a high frequency, (c) the perceptions of the <b>principals</b> and <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> were similar, and (d) <b>principals</b> and <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> reported more engagement in instructional leadership responsibilities and felt more pressured over the last five years under the new accountability and rating requirements of No Child Left Behind and the state assessments. These findings suggested that the administrative roles and responsibilities in high schools should be restructured to allow <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> to focus on instructional leadership...|$|R
