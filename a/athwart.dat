25|$|The {{launching}} {{of a conservative}} weekly journal of opinion in a country widely {{assumed to be a}} bastion of conservatism at first glance looks like a work of supererogation, rather like publishing a royalist weekly within the walls of Buckingham Palace. It is not that of course; if National Review is superfluous, it is so for very different reasons: It stands <b>athwart</b> history, yelling Stop, at a time when no other is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it.|$|E
25|$|While {{the battle}} {{ended in a}} French victory, with the Prussians in retreat and Grouchy firmly <b>athwart</b> Prussian lines of {{communication}} to the east, this situation lasted a total of 30 minutes and thus it proved hollow. The Prussians had held their ground long enough to allow Blücher's transfer of 72,000 troops to Wellington’s aid at Waterloo. Thus, for the Prussians, the battle was a strategic success, as it contributed to the decisive victory at Waterloo. The Prussian rearguard of 17,000 troops had tied down 33,000 French troops that could have otherwise taken part at Waterloo.|$|E
25|$|On 10 September, a {{pathfinder}} unit of Commando Raiders {{secured a}} landing zone six kilometers east of Paksong. GM 32 landed to {{be greeted by}} sniper fire. The Royalist regiment advanced despite a glancing engagement with the PAVN 9th Regiment that caused 33 Royalist casualties. By the next morning GM 32 had secured {{a position on the}} Phou Theveda high ground <b>athwart</b> Route 232, four kilometers east of Paksong. The following day, 12 September, a levy of 670 reinforcements cobbled together from three different commands were flown into a landing zone seven kilometers southeast of Paksong. They attacked northwards to back up GM 32. On 13 September, GM 32 repelled PAVN counterattacks.|$|E
25|$|The ROK 1st Division had {{advanced}} steadily toward Munsan-ni without enemy contact. Early on March 24, Task Force Boone, a division armored column consisting of Company C, 64th Tank Battalion (on loan to General Paik Sun-yup from the 3d Division), Paik's tank destroyer battalion (organized as an infantry unit), {{and two of}} his engineer platoons, stepped ahead of the division and reached the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team at midmorning. By day's end the remainder of the division occupied a line extending from positions <b>athwart</b> Route 1 about three miles (5km) below Munsan-ni northeastward to Pobwon-ni, a village on lateral Route 2Y six miles (10km) east of Munsan-ni area. General Paik relieved General Bowen of responsibility for the Munsan-ni area at 17:00 and placed Task Force Boone in position just above the town.|$|E
25|$|Holding Tarvisio {{with only}} 6,000 troops, Albert Gyulay relied on two {{outlying}} forts to stall the Franco-Italian advance. At Malborghetto Valbruna, a fort frowned {{down upon the}} Fella valley from a mountain spur. The Predil Pass blockhouse stood <b>athwart</b> Seras' road from the south. Malborghetto was defended by Captain Friedrich Hensel with 650 Grenz infantry and 10 cannons, while Captain Johann Hermann, 250 Grenzers, and eight artillery pieces held Predil. Eugène and Seras arrived before the two forts on 15 May and initiated the Battle of Tarvis. Baraguey d'Hilliers bypassed Malborghetto with two divisions and skirmished with Albert Gyulay's main force at Tarvisio on 16 May, while Grenier moved his two divisions into assault positions below the Malborghetto fort. Beginning at 9:30 AM on 17 May, 15,000 troops stormed the position in thirty minutes. Hensel and 350 Austrians were killed and between 50 and 300 were captured. Grenier reported 80 casualties but losses were probably much heavier.|$|E
25|$|The Confederate retreat reached Big Black River Bridge {{the night}} of May 16–17. Pemberton ordered Brig. Gen. Bowen, with three brigades, to man the fortifications on the east {{bank of the river}} and impede any Union pursuit. Three {{divisions}} of McClernand's corps moved out from Edwards Station on the morning of May 17. The corps encountered the Confederates behind breastworks and took cover as enemy artillery began firing. Union Brig. Gen. Michael K. Lawler formed his 2nd Brigade, Brig. Gen. Eugene A. Carr's Division, which surged out of a river meander scar, across the front of the Confederate forces, and into the enemy's breastworks, held by Brig. Gen. John C. Vaughn's inexperienced East Tennessee Brigade. Confused and panicked, the Confederates began to withdraw across the Big Black on two bridges: the railroad bridge and the steamboat dock moored <b>athwart</b> the river. As soon as they had crossed, the Confederates set fire to the bridges, preventing close Union pursuit. The fleeing Confederates who arrived in Vicksburg later that day were disorganized. The Union forces captured approximately 1,800 troops at Big Black, a loss that the Confederates could ill afford.|$|E
25|$|Washington met Lee's {{retreating}} division late in {{the morning}} and took measures to halt Clinton's advance. Washington relieved Lee of command, but later allowed him to patch together a defensive line with the available troops. Lee put Varnum's Brigade, now under the command of Jeremiah Olney behind a hedgerow. Livingston's detachment filed into line on Olney's left. On the left flank of the position, Washington asked Stewart and Nathaniel Ramsey, who took over from the wounded Wesson, to hold off the British until he could get the main army in position. The two readily agreed. Soon after, Anthony Wayne appeared and ordered the two detachments to hold a thick wood. Ramsey formed on the extreme left with Stewart to his right. Lee's chief of artillery, Eleazer Oswald placed two cannons on Olney's right and two more in support of Stewart and Ramsey. As the 1st Guards Battalion came abreast of the woods, the Americans riddled their flank and dropped British Colonel Henry Trelawney and 40 guardsmen. But the crack Brigade of Guards and two companies of the 1st Grenadier Battalion stormed into the woods. Early in the action, Stewart went down, shot in the groin, and was carried to the rear. The outnumbered Americans were pressed back from the trees and attacked by the 16th Light Dragoons in the open. Ramsey was wounded and captured by the dragoons while the Americans made a dash for the bridge across the ravine. After another epic struggle on the other flank, Olney, Livingston, and Oswald were forced back. But the holding actions gave Washington time to deploy Lord Stirling's division <b>athwart</b> Clinton's advance.|$|E
500|$|During the Jordanian {{occupation}} of the eastern Jerusalem (1948–67), no Jews were allowed {{to live in the}} Old City. Since the start of Israeli {{occupation of}} the Old City in 1967, the Jewish Quarter has expanded by some 40% and by 2000, 71 (12%) or 81 (14%) of the 581 properties in the Armenian Quarter were owned by Jews. The Armenian community is concerned that the Jewish Quarter [...] "will expand as the number of Jews in the Old City continues to grow while the Armenian population withers." [...] The location of the Armenian Quarter <b>athwart</b> the main access roads between the Israeli-controlled West Jerusalem and the holy sites within the Jewish Quarter and the Western Wall has made Armenian properties a prime real estate in Israeli eyes. According to Reuters, the Armenian Patriarchate [...] "share a view held by the mostly Muslim Palestinians—that Israel's designation of the whole city as capital of the Jewish state means its control of residence and building permits is being used to press Arabs and other non-Jews to give up and leave." [...] Israeli sovereignty over the Armenian Quarter would be, according to Usher, the [...] "worst future imaginable" [...] for the Armenian community. Members of Jerusalem's Armenian community have voiced concerns about the Israeli government's policies and commitment to preserving their community's presence in the Old City.|$|E

2500|$|Between 30 April and 22 June, the {{submarine}} made a patrol which returned her to Empire waters. Directed by an Ultra from Pearl Harbor, Trigger lay <b>athwart</b> the projected track of Admiral Koga's task force returning from Truk. Koga's force came in sight {{the morning of}} 22 May, but zigged away, out of range, [...] "a bitter disappointment". On 28 May, Trigger contacted two freighters off Iro Saki and fired three torpedoes at the larger. One hit aft. When last seen, the ship was down by the stern. The next day, {{the submarine}} fired a spread of three torpedoes at a small cargo ship. Two missed and the third exploded prematurely. She then fired a fourth torpedo, which apparently hit but failed to explode.|$|E
2500|$|The main guns {{benefited from}} their {{placement}} {{when compared to}} those of foreign armored cruisers. The British mounted the majority of 9.2-inch guns on its , [...] and [...] cruisers <b>athwart</b> their forecastles on the main deck. This made the guns very wet and practically useless in less than moderate seas. The 10-inch guns of the Tennessees, on the other hand, were [...] above the waterline. In comparing these ships, theoretician and chief constructor for the Royal Danish Navy, Commander William Hovgaard, considered the Tennessees placement [...] "beyond question, the best gun position in a ship. The arc of fire {{is more than twice}} that which can be obtained on the broadside, the field of view is entirely free, and a combination of longitudinal and broadside fire on both sides is obtained, which is alone possible in the end positions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Callicratidas, {{once he had}} {{assembled}} his fleet, sailed against Methymna, on Lesbos, which he laid siege to and stormed. From Methymna, Callicratidas could potentially move to capture the rest of Lesbos, which would {{clear the way for}} him to move his fleet to the Hellespont, where he would be <b>athwart</b> the all-important Athenian grain supply line; to defend Lesbos, Conon was forced to move his numerically inferior fleet from Samos to the Hekatonnesi islands near Methymna. [...] When Callicratidas attacked him, however, with a fleet that had swelled to a size of 170 ships, Conon was forced to flee to Mytilene, where he was blockaded with his fleet after losing 30 ships in a clash {{at the mouth of the}} harbor. Besieged by land and sea, Conon was powerless to act against the vastly superior forces that surrounded him, and was only barely able to slip a messenger ship out to Athens to carry the news of his plight.|$|E
2500|$|There are MacAulays on the Uists {{that may}} descend from the Macaulays of Lewis. There are, however, others that claim no kinship with their namesakes on Lewis. According to tradition, these MacAulays {{originally}} {{came to the}} Uist from Na h-Eileanan Tarsainn (Matheson translated this as [...] "the <b>Athwart</b> Islands"), which may refer to the isles of Rum, Eigg and Canna (also known as the Small Isles). It has been claimed that these MacAulays may have ultimately originated in the Lennox area, around Loch Lomond; and that their name {{is derived from the}} Gaelic [...] Amhalgaigh, rather than a Gaelicised Norse name. If there is truth to the claim, this could make them related to the MacAulays of Ardincaple. Matheson, however, proposed that the Uist MacAulays originated on the Inner Hebridean island of Coll. Within the centre of the island are the remains of a stone fort—Dùn Anlaimh—and loch—Loch Anlaimh—named after Amhlaidh Mór. According to Coll tradition, Amhlaidh Mór was a Norse chieftain who was ultimately defeated by an ancestor of the Macleans of Coll. Matheson considered that it was possible that Amhlaidh Mór was the progenitor of the Uist MacAulays.|$|E
2500|$|The Iroquois {{established}} dominance {{over the}} fur trade throughout their territory, bargaining with European colonists. Other New York tribes were more subject to either European destruction or assimilation within the Iroquoian confederacy. Situated <b>athwart</b> major Native trade routes in the Northeast and positioned between French and English zones of settlement, the Iroquois were intensely {{caught up with}} the onrush of Europeans, which is also to say that the settlers, whether Dutch, French or English, were {{caught up with the}} Iroquois as well. Algonquian tribes were less united among their tribes; they typically lived along rivers, streams, or the Atlantic Coast. But, both groups of natives were well-established peoples with highly sophisticated cultural systems; these were little understood or appreciated by the European colonists who encountered them. The natives had [...] "a complex and elaborate native economy that included hunting, gathering, manufacturing, and farming... a mosaic of Native American tribes, nations, languages, and political associations." [...] The Iroquois usually met at an Onondaga in Northern New York, which changed every century or so, where they would coordinate policies {{on how to deal with}} Europeans and strengthen the bond between the Five Nations.|$|E
2500|$|After Emperor Jing {{ordered the}} {{execution}} of Chao Cuo {{at the urging of}} Yuan Ang, Liu Wu was besieged at his capital Suiyang by the armies of Wu and Chu during the Rebellion of the Seven Princes. His mother the empress dowager Xiaowen urged the emperor to send the imperial army to relieve him. The general Zhou Yafu succeeded in counselling against a direct assault: instead, his force took advantage of disorder among the rebels to establish a strong camp at Xiayi ( [...] , modern Dangshan in Anhui) <b>athwart</b> their line of supply and communication along the Si River. Ignoring Liu Wu's pleas for help and imperial orders to advance to the city, he occupied his time strengthening his defenses and sending Han Tuidang's cavalry raiders to disrupt what little overland supply the rebels could manage from Chu. Having wearied their armies assaulting Suiyang, the rebel princes were forced to fall back for supplies and their assaults on Xiayi were defeated with such prepared ease that Zhou initially refused to be woken from bed. This was effectively the end of the rebellion: the Prince of Chu took his own life and Liu Pi was killed by Yue natives as he fled. Luan Bu followed this by defeating the other rebel princes, who chose either death or execution. The successful strategy earned Zhou Yafu the wrath of the Prince of Liang and his mother, however. They eventually succeeded in poisoning the emperor against him: he was imprisoned on minor issues involving his son's dispute with a supplier and, in the end, chose to fast to death in prison.|$|E
