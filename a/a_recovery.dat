5|$|After making <b>a</b> <b>recovery,</b> Kizirian and the Marine units {{took the}} capital city of NaHa and were {{preparing}} for another assault. Kizirian's unit had fought its way to the crest of a hill and dug in. Kizirian was standing watch at the company command post inside an Okinawa burial ground. When replacements joined the company, many Japanese soldiers harassed the lines by infiltrating the positions of the more inexperienced soldiers. Kizirian ordered that flares should be fired at irregular intervals to would illuminate the scene and distract the enemy. The idea proved successful and the newly arrived Marines soon had the situation under control.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{suffered}} a sudden apoplectic {{fit on the}} morning of 2 February 1685, and died aged 54 at 11:45am four days later at Whitehall Palace. The suddenness of his illness and death led to suspicion of poison in the minds of many, including one of the royal doctors; however, a more modern medical analysis has held that the symptoms of his final illness {{are similar to those of}} uraemia (a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction). In the days between his collapse and his death, Charles endured a variety of torturous treatments including bloodletting, purging and cupping in hopes of effecting <b>a</b> <b>recovery.</b>|$|E

5|$|During the 20th century, {{sea otter}} numbers rebounded in {{about two-thirds of}} their {{historic}} range, <b>a</b> <b>recovery</b> {{considered one of the}} greatest successes in marine conservation. However, the IUCN still lists the sea otter as an endangered species, and describes the significant threats to sea otters as oil pollution, predation by orcas, poaching, and conflicts with fisheries– sea otters can drown if entangled in fishing gear. The hunting of sea otters is no longer legal except for limited harvests by indigenous peoples in the United States. Poaching was a serious concern in the Russian Far East immediately {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union in 1991; however, it has declined significantly with stricter law enforcement and better economic conditions.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the impacts}} of Hurricane Opal in 1995, Earl and later Hurricane Georges, the state of Florida {{undertook}} <b>a</b> <b>recovery</b> project to restore the eroded beaches along the Panhandle coast. In October United States Department of Transportation provided $2million in funds to repair damaged and destroyed roads in Florida. On December3, an additional $1.7million was provided to repair funds. The United States Military allocated $2.2million to repair damage from Hurricane Earl to training academies and naval ports. The Florida Senate provided $25,740 in emergency funds to Hurricane Earl victims. By {{the end of the}} disaster declaration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency provided $1million in public assistance and $600,000 in disaster mitigation.|$|E
5|$|Furious {{returned}} to the dockyard in November to have the aft turret removed and replaced by another deck for landing, giving her both a launching and <b>a</b> <b>recovery</b> deck. Two lifts (elevators) serving the hangars were also installed. Furious was recommissioned on 15 March 1918, and her embarked aircraft were used on anti-Zeppelin patrols in the North Sea after May. In July 1918, she flew off seven Sopwith Camels which participated in the Tondern raid, attacking the Zeppelin sheds there with moderate success.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, {{frontman}} Dave Mustaine {{announced that}} he was disbanding Megadeth due to an arm injury that rendered him unable to play guitar. In a statement published on April 3, 2002, he stated that doctors expected that it would take about a year before he would recover from the injury. However, it was uncertain as to how complete of <b>a</b> <b>recovery</b> it would be. Mustaine stated his hopes to regain the ability to play guitar.

5|$|John {{consolidated}} his conquests and {{the existing}} Byzantine holdings in Asia by {{the building of}} a series of forts. Historian Paul Magdalino explains this process in his book The empire of Manuel Komnenos by placing {{it in the context of}} the Komnenian restoration of the Byzantine empire as a whole; he points out that while John's father Alexios had fortified places on the coast, John now expanded Byzantine control into the interior by fortifying places such as Lopadion, Achyraous and Laodicea, which guarded the approaches to the valleys and coastlands of Asia Minor. This restoration of order under John enabled agricultural prosperity to begin <b>a</b> <b>recovery</b> that would eventually restore these war torn regions to their former status as a productive and valuable part of the Byzantine empire.|$|E

5|$|One {{week later}} the FIA {{announced}} a review panel {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident, which was made up of former drivers and team principals, and published its findings four weeks later. The report found that there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident. Instead, the contributing factors were found to include track conditions, car speed and the presence of <b>a</b> <b>recovery</b> vehicle on the circuit. The report also made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering stricken vehicles — which were subsequently introduced for the 2015 season — before concluding that {{it would not have been}} possible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries through changes to the cockpit design. The report also revealed that the fail-safe for the car's brake-by-wire system had failed. Despite this, Marussia was not found to be responsible for the accident.|$|E

In 1997, P. bellidiflora was the subject of <b>a</b> <b>recovery</b> workshop conducted by the California Department of Fish and Game, where the need for permanently protecting and managing the existing populations, and reintroduction strategies for populations into suitable protected habitat were analyzed. Management and recovery actions for the species have been addressed in the United States Federal Recovery Plan for Serpentine Soil Species of the San Francisco Bay Area, finalized in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Records {{state that}} plague deaths in London and the suburbs crept {{up over the}} summer from 2,000 people per week to over 7,000 per week in September. These figures {{are likely to be}} a {{considerable}} underestimate. Many of the sextons and parish clerks who kept the records themselves died. Quakers refused to co-operate and many of the poor were just dumped into mass graves unrecorded. It is not clear how many people caught the disease and made <b>a</b> <b>recovery</b> because only deaths were recorded and many records were destroyed in the Great Fire of London the following year.
