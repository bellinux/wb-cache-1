40|$|Many {{candidate}} biomarkers for {{diagnosis of}} prostate cancer have been investigated, but prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing remains the frontline test for both mass screening and individual clinical testing. Although the PSA test is cost-effective, analytically reliable, and flexibly high throughput, {{it has a very}} weak correlation with prostate malignancy. This has resulted in over-diagnosis and over-treatment of patients leading to costly economic, social, and psychological impacts. PSA testing lacks the ability to molecularly characterize prostate diseases and define aggressiveness and lethality, which are necessary to influence choice of treatment. Therefore, newer molecular tests are beginning to replace the PSA tests. The prostate cancer antigen 3 test has shown superiority and is now widely used. The recently reported sarcosine urine test, the already delineated TMPRSS 2 : ETS fusion genes, the glutathione-S-transferase P 1 serum marker, and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 biomarker may also help improve diagnosis and prognostication {{of prostate cancer}}. The <b>analytical</b> <b>trend</b> is toward a multiplex testing format using molecular and/or proteomic techniques that are reliable, accurate, reproducible, and ensure rapid quantitation. Therefore, validation of these newer biomarkers and their assays are necessary for both large-scale clinical trials and clinical utility.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to study the {{theoretical}} and practical aspects of using the system-synergetic approach to the development and functioning of banking systems under conditions of financial instability. It has been grounded that the theoretical foundations {{for the development of}} banking systems are based on the system approach, according to which the banking systems belong to a class of special complex dynamic, self-motivated and open systems with an integrated structure of subsystems and functions. The study of such systems should include two aspects — system-cybernetic and system-synergetic ones. It has been proved that under stationary conditions the banking system development goes on in accordance with the systemcybernetic model, which suggests the presence of a management subsystem, which functions are performed by the central bank. Under conditions of financial instability, in the pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis periods to study the development of banking systems the system-synergetic approach taking into account the multi-variant and alternative development of the banking system at bifurcation points is used. The criteria of the banking system entering the phase of bifurcation based on assessing the volatility of the current liabilities and possibility of building an <b>analytical</b> <b>trend</b> have been determined. The methodical approaches to evaluating the synergistic effects and level of financial stability of the banking system have been suggested, experimental calculations have been made...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} {{health monitoring}} (SHM) of structures is acquiring {{a key role}} in the present time. An in situ system able to assess the health state of bolted joints would save money and maintenance time, by allowing quick assessment of residual life and degradation state of structures. In the last decades, SHM systems based on linear acoustic/ultrasound methods have been investigated extensively. The scope of this study was to develop a reliable index able to assess the loosening/tightening health state of a bolted structure based on linear and nonlinear acoustic/ultrasound parameters. In particular, for the linear acoustic/ultrasound method, a tightening/loosening state index based on the first-order acoustic moment was developed. This method is based on the assumption that a change of signal energy would be recorded for different loosening/tightening states. As for the nonlinear methods, under single- and multi-frequency excitation, high-harmonics generation and sidebands modulation indices were developed. The developed tightening/loosening state index trend was very well reproduced by an analytical expression where they are expressed as function of the torque applied. In particular, the fully loosened (kissing bond) and tight state of bolted structures can be clearly identified by the measured plateau region. The proposed <b>analytical</b> <b>trend</b> approximates the experimental results with excellent correlation. By knowing this trend and measuring the proposed indices, it would be possible to know the torque applied on the bolt and therefore assess the health state of a bolted structure...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} {{reconsideration}} of the Arabic adnominal markers {{and of its}} modification structure, {{on the ground that}} the current <b>analytical</b> <b>trend,</b> which likens them to their Indo-european counterparts, runs into several problems. It develops an unified account of the adnominal markers, and argues that all of them are to be understood as copulae recursively embedded into the Arabic modification structure. Modifiers too are interpreted here in an unified way, all of them being rethought of as a non-restrictive relative clause, at least originally. Among the consequences of this approach are reinterpreting nunation as a Numeral Classifier and the prenominal article as a medial article. As for case-endings, the present dissertation revives the Semitistic hypothesis that underlying to them is a morpheme w and proposes to identify it with the Conjunction w ‘and’ widespread in Arabic and Semitic, since this kind of conjunction crosslinguistically (e. g. in English, Somali) mediates the predicational relationship between the NP / Subject and the non-restrictive relative clause / Predicate. Moreover, it is argued here that Arabic case is actually a semantic opposition Subject vs. Non-subject that develops out of a copular opposition between lack vs. presence of Predicate Inversion. The copula analysis of the Arabic modification structure has also some interesting implications for linguistic theory in general, because it provides a definition of word as well as {{a better understanding of the}} fusive, agglutinating and isolating morphological types. This thesis capitalizes on the findings of some recent threads of research. On diachronic level, it adopts Owens’s theory about Arabic dialects and Classical Arabic, according to which the former are older than the latter, as well as Garbini’s and Durand’s view that Arabic is a mixed language made up of an Amorite and a Pre-semitic parastrate. In synchrony, it follows Moro’s theory of Dynamic Antisymmetry, which explains the displacement phenomenon typical of natural languages as a consequence of another key-property of them, namely Saussurean linearity...|$|E

40|$|The PELE {{ammunition}} {{is characterized}} by a low-density filling material surrounded by a high-density brittle jacket material. An analytical model describing the fragmentation of this ammunition behind a target plate is presented. This model assumes uniaxial strain in the filling and uses the RankingeHugoniot relations to calculate the material state. In addition, shock and rarefaction wave interactions at the target free surface and the filling/target interface are accounted for, as well as the radial rarefaction originating from the jacket outer surface. This allows the calculation of the pressure evolution in the filling and the radial acceleration of the jacket at any axial position along the projectile. This model aims at improving previously published analytical models where the acoustic wave approximation was used and the wave interactions were neglected. Experimental results (Paulus and Schirm, 2006) are used to validate the analytical model for different target materials (aluminum and steel), target thicknesses (3 mm and 8 mm), filling materials (polyethylene and aluminum) and impact velocities (900 m/s to 3000 m/s). A qualitative comparison based on X-ray photographs reveals similar features between the model and the experiments, such as smaller and lighter fragments with a greater radial velocity {{at the front of the}} projectile compared to the fragment characteristics at the back of the projectile. A quantitative comparison based on the maximum radial velocity of the fragments shows on average a 20 % difference between the analytical and experimental results for all impact conditions considered. Despite this difference, the <b>analytical</b> <b>trend</b> follows more closely the experimental one compared to the acoustic approximation especially at high impact velocities. In addition, the acoustic approximation fails to reproduce the jacket fragmentation pattern since the fragmentation length of the jacket is significantly under-predicted. A numerical simulation is also presented using the ANSYS Autodyn 14. 0 software. The results show that the numerical and analytical pressure evolution in the filling and the radial velocity of the jacket are in very good agreement, verifying the uniaxial strain assumption. This agreement (together with the experimental agreement) thus suggests that the RankineeHugoniot relations, the wave interactions and the radial rarefaction wave must all be included in the model to adequately describe the fragmentation of the PELE ammunition behind a thin target plate...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} transient binary nucleation, both qualitatively and quantitatively, we numerically {{solved the}} birth-death equations for vapor-to-liquid phase transitions. We {{found that in}} its early transient stages, binary nucleation rarely, if ever, occurs via the saddle point. Instead most binary systems pass through a temporary stage in which the region of maximum flux extends over a ridge on the free energy surface before reaching the state of saddle point nucleation. Both the number of particles formed and their composition may be affected, and this could be very important for nucleation in glasses and other condensed mixtures for which timescales are very long. In order to plan experiments, accurate estimates of the time lag are important. We therefore directly calculated the time lag for the saddle point flux using our numerical results and compared it with the available analytical predictions. Although the analytical results over-estimate the time lag by factors of 2 - 6, the numerical results followed the predicted <b>analytical</b> <b>trends</b> quite closely under most conditions...|$|R

The wing had a rectangular planform of aspect ratio 1. 5 and a 64 A 010 airfoil. Various considerations and procedures for conducting flutter tests in a cryogenic wind tunnel were evaluated. Flutter onset conditions were established from extrapolated subcritical response measurements. A flutter boundary was determined at cryogenic temperatures over a Mach number M range from 0. 5 to 0. 9. Flutter was obtained at two different Reynolds numbers R at M = 0. 5 (R = 4. 4 and 18. 4 x 10 to the 6 th power) and at M = 0. 8 (R = 5. 0 and 10. 4 x 10 to the 6 th power).

40|$|The aims of {{this project}} are two-fold. Firstly, it aims to {{correlate}} the erotically charged philosophy of Alexander Skryabin with the progressive harmonic structures of his music. Secondly it proposes a new harmonic theory {{which is designed to}} offer {{a deeper understanding of the}} ways in which music can represent and embody the mechanisms of the human 'drive'. This involves unravelling the numerous strands of thought - both esoteric and mainstream ― that constructed Skryabin's idiosyncratic and highly eccentric world-view. To understand fully tills complex body of ideas it appeals to 20 (^th) century psychoanalysis in the Freudian tradition. This vital link connects Skryabin's interest in psychology and philosophy to his compositional procedures whilst showing that certain of Freud's ideas were crystallised in writings on desire from the 1960 ร which also brought the various contradictions betrayed in Skryabin's writings into the spotlight. In some cases, Skryabin's music itself offers safe paths out of his philosophical quagmire, where the formal propositions of his writings fail. Whilst the harmonic theory proposed is deeply rooted in the philosophy that Skryabin himself studied, it is equally grown from a correspondence between current <b>trends</b> of <b>analytical</b> thought in music and <b>analytical</b> <b>trends</b> that have been predominant in Russia.

During this period, Indigenous social movements, state legislation and policy, and media technologies converged in media-producing institutions across the country, contributing to the proliferation of Indigenous film, television, video, and digital media. Indigenous filmmakers, producers, and artists navigate the complex terrain of institutional discourses and practices in the development of their work, negotiations that ultimately shape screen content. This approach intervenes in <b>analytical</b> <b>trends</b> that interpret Indigenous production in terms of oppositional cultural politics, setting this work against a monolithic colonial state apparatus. Such approaches position Indigenous producers as cultural “auteurs,” whose work gives evidence of a shared cultural/political aesthetic, which risks overlooking areas of production not associated with the features of these cultural politics. Further, juxtaposing Indigenous media with the state does not explain why the state would create policy and programs that support a body of work that would ostensibly undermine its hegemony. This project argues that state support represents an attempt of the liberal pluralist state to “manage” Indigenous challenges to its authority by incorporating Indigeneity into the national cultural fabric. However, examination of the institutional dimensions of production reveals the unevenness and contingency of state influence, as national policy and ideology are interpreted according to a given institution’s cultures and practices, which are in turn navigated by media practitioners and their work. By doing so, this project contributes institutional analysis as a crucial but under-examined lens for the interpretation of Indigenous screen content, and applies it to areas of Indigenous production and institutions of media culture that have not yet had significant scholarly attention, including provincial television and academic research institutions, to begin recuperating these areas into the historical and scholarly record...|$|R

Those devices must be maintained at cryogenic temperatures to prevent {{the loss of their}} superconducting properties and retain their performance superiority. They are conventionally cooled via direct heat conduction, which leads to undesirable temperature differences among the various components being cooled. Compact micropumps capable of pumping liquid nitrogen at 77 K into liquid-cooling circuits would enable a much more compact and lightweight method of maintaining a uniform temperature across the cooling circuit. These pumps can also address the demand for delivering small doses of LN 2 to particular spots in bioengineering applications. One of the main objectives {{of the present study was}} to develop an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) ion-drag micropump with LN 2 as the working liquid. EHD ion-drag pumping phenomenon refers to liquid motion caused by an interaction between electric and hydrodynamic fields in a dielectric liquid. To investigate the effect of each design parameter on the performance of the micropump, several prototypes with four distinct designs were fabricated and packaged. The designs included a variety of emitter shapes, inter-electrode spacings, electrode-pair spacings, and channel heights. The micropumps were tested at different DC voltages ranging from 0 to 2. 5 kV. Two test rigs with novel measurement techniques were also designed, built, and calibrated to measure the generated static pressure head, electric current, and flow rate with an acceptable level of accuracy. The relationships between pressure/current (P-I) and pressure/voltage (P-V) for various designs were investigated experimentally. The results showed good agreement with the general <b>analytical</b> <b>trends</b> reported for EHD pumping in the literature.

40|$|Fluidic self {{assembly}} (FSA) is {{a promising}} new method for manufacturing microscopic assemblies, which offers impressive advantages over traditional “top-down” fabrication methods. It works automatically by transporting {{large numbers of}} micro devices using hydrodynamic steering. The interaction of the fluid flow, {{the shape of the}} part, and the orientation and the shape of the binding sites all contribute to the final yield of the assembly process. Therefore, investigating the role of fluid forces during assembly is essential for optimizing of the FSA process. ^ In this thesis, a novel photolithography-based direct particle fabrication technique is presented {{that can be used to}} fabricate polymeric micro particles of varied and complex shapes with high throughput. This technique offers fine control over particle size and shape. These shape-specific particles can be used to model the micro devices used in FSA process. ^ To study the orientation and translation of such particles sliding on the substrate in a flow field can be very useful to improve the efficiency of the assembly process. Previous analytical and experimental works on single particle motions in viscous fluid are reviewed. Although there are no directly comparable <b>analytical</b> results, <b>analytical</b> <b>trends</b> and dependences on parameters in simplified system can shed some light on FSA performance. In particular, elliptical particles in simple shear flow show a potential of aligning particles by hydrodynamic forces. ^ A flow system is set up and experiments are carried out using particles of assorted shapes. Experimental results show the tendency of those particles to align to preferred orientations in the flow chamber by hydrodynamic forces. A micro imaging system is used to image the position and orientation of the particles. The preferred orientation of particles with different shapes was measured using algebraic moment theory. Rectangular particles were assembled onto a substrate with complementary recesses of varying angles relative to the flow direction. It is observed that a simple change in the orientation of the recesses can drastically change the final assembly yield from more than 90 % to less than 50 %. ...|$|R

Furthermore, because of their focus on pitch content, they tend to neglect the expressive potential of this music. By approaching Schoenberg's music with the tools of musical topic theory, the connections between this music and its historical and cultural contexts can be demonstrated and issues of musical meaning can be explored. Part I: Historical Background explores the historical context necessary for the analysis of Schoenberg's music. Chapter 1 surveys the <b>analytical</b> <b>trends</b> applied to Schoenberg's music through their approach to musical meaning; Chapter 2 provides a literature review of topic theory, addresses critiques thereof, and explores issues pertaining to our understanding of new topics. Part II: Analytical Approaches demonstrates four different applications of topical analysis. Chapter 3 considers the intersection of topics and leitmotiv in Schoenberg's Pelleas und Melisande to demonstrate how the topics and structure of the various leitmotivs convey and create associations between characters and ideas in the drama. Chapter 4 compares the use of the pianto and the chorale topic in all periods of Schoenberg's career, arguing that their presence in the atonal and twelve-tone works is increasingly motivated by issues of program and text. Chapter 5 features an in-depth analysis of the second of the Three Piano Pieces, Op. 11, using the unfolding of the topics to create a narrative that accounts for the tonal and atonal elements in the piece. Chapter 6 provides a lexicon of the topics in Schoenberg's atonal music which includes descriptions of the musical signifier and the cultural signifieds, multiple examples of the topic, and both earlier and later instances of similar passages from Schoenberg's work...|$|R

40|$|Many European urban regions have {{experienced}} a transformation from a compact monocentric toward a less compact polycentric urban region since the 1960 s. The debate on emerging polycentricity in Europe so far {{tends to be more}} theoretical than <b>analytical.</b> The <b>trend</b> toward increasingly polycentric urban regions is meanwhile beyond dispute, but the effects of this transformation on urban regions and their components have only been explored to a limited extent. Are the "old" central cities only losing people, functions, and status to the new urban centers, or do these centers complement each other and specialize in terms of economic activities and population composition? This article presents evidence for the Amsterdam urban region regarding population distribution, selective migration, job growth, and economic specializations of the region's subcenters. It will become clear from our data that the Amsterdam urban region has indeed become more polycentric, but also that Amsterdam has managed to remain a vital center. The newer and older urban subcenters have become increasingly important, but rather than competing with Amsterdam, they develop in a complementary way...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} into two distinct novel adaptive structures concepts is performed {{with a view}} to improving the aerodynamic efficiency of aircraft wings. The main focus of the work is on the development of a rotating spars concept that enables the adaptive aeroelastic shape control of aircraft wings in order to reduce drag. By altering the orientation of the internal wing structure, it becomes possible to control the flexural and torsional stiffnesses of the wing, as well as the position of the elastic axis. It follows then that control of the aeroelastic deformation is also possible. Consequently, the aerodynamic performance can be tailored, and more specifically the lift-to-drag ratio can be maximised through continuous adjustment of the structure. To gain a thorough understanding of the effect of the concept on a wing, an assumed modes static aeroelastic model is developed, and studies are performed using this. These studies establish guidelines with regards to the effective design of a wing incorporating the rotating spars concept. The findings of these studies are then used to establish a baseline design for a wind tunnel model. A finite element model of this is constructed and aeroelastic analyses are used to improve the model and arrive at the final experimental wing design. The wind tunnel tests confirm <b>analytical</b> <b>trends</b> and the robustness of an approach to automaticallyadapt the structure to maintain an aerodynamic performance objective. The remainder of the work investigates the application of an all-moving wing tip device with an adaptive torsional stiffness attachment as a passive loads alleviation system. Through consideration of the attachment stiffness and position, it is possible to tune the device throughout flight in order to minimise the loads that are introduced into the aircraft structure in response to a gust or manoeuvre. A dynamic aeroelastic wing model incorporating the device is developed and used to perform parameter studies; this gives an insight into the sizing and placement of the device. Next, a finite element representation of a conceptual High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft is used as a baseline platform for the device. Aeroelastic analyses are performed for the baseline and modified models to investigate the effect of the attachment stiffness and position on the gust response and aeroelastic stability of the system. The reduced loading within thestructure of the modified aircraft then enables the model to be optimised {{in order to reduce the}} mass of the aircraft.
