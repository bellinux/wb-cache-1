25|$|These {{manufacturers}} offer special {{models for}} fishing {{that are designed}} and accessorized for this sport, including specially designed hatches, built-in coolers & rod holders, gps receivers and equipment mounts. Other accessories include live wells, anchor trolleys and running lights. Specially designed fishing kayaks usually have designs {{similar to those of}} recreational sit-in and sit-on-top kayaks characterized by very wide beams (up to 36 inches) that increase lateral stability. The increases stability allows for the angler to stand up and fish on the kayak. These kayaks provide a considerable space for storage inside their hulls which allow the angler to stow rods, fishing gear, batteries for fish finders, extra paddles, anchors, and wheels to tow the kayak from vehicle to the water. The cutouts molded into the top of the kayaks are well-suited to hold milk crates with additional supplies. Some anglers equip their fishing kayaks with outriggers to further increase stability. In recent years people have begun using kayaks for fly fishing, most models suited for upright fly casting include upright braces that <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> safely stand up.|$|E
25|$|Smuggling {{activity}} in Britain became more prevalent though the Tudor and Stuart period reaching its peak {{at the end}} of the 18th century. High rates of duty were levied on imported wine, spirits, and other luxury goods to pay for Britain's expensive wars with France and the United States. Cornwall was a haven for smugglers at this time, with its many secluded coves ideally suited for evasion of the duty, a smuggling provided a highly profitable venture for impoverished fishermen and seafarers. St Buryan was no different in this respect, and also home to smuggling activity. Thomas Johns, a known smuggler and agent of smugglers, was the landlord of the Kings Arms public house, formerly on the site of Belmont House in the village square, who divided his time between St Buryan and his liquor establishments in Roscoff, Brittany. More famous still was the Lamorna wink public house near Lamorna Cove which was also a base for smugglers. The pub was so named as winking at the barman would reputedly <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> purchase smuggled spirits.|$|E

500|$|In the Americas, Native American {{nations were}} {{severely}} damaged by European settlers, specifically {{because of the}} Europeans' advanced military technology. Favreau compared the film to the historical confrontation [...] "in the frustration of not having the technology to <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> prevail. It's always the low-tech culture that feels powerless when faced with an enemy that has technology on their side." [...] In the film, the cowboys are the low-tech culture, and the aliens with advanced technology possess the belief of Manifest Destiny. Favreau also said of the premise, [...] "It allows the cowboys and Native Americans to come together, which would be impossible had there not been a greater common enemy. It sets the Western {{up in a very}} classic way and then turns it on its ear." [...] When the aliens appear, the film becomes a road movie in which the main characters try to track the aliens, team up with different groups, and ultimately confront the aliens. Favreau compared the gathering to The Magnificent Seven in facing seemingly insurmountable odds in their confrontation.|$|E

Spielberg stated he chose to work with the Boston Symphony Orchestra because the film deals with a [...] "company of soldiers" [...] and the orchestra was an [...] "experienced company of musicians."

The show's first series ran for nine episodes. In June 2000, then Director-General of the BBC Greg Dyke pledged extra funding for BBC One, some of which was used for extra episodes of Holby City.

[...] "You see the thing about Cyberpunk is that {{it was supposed to be}} like a homemade record, much like these rap bands are doing, all made really on home equipment.

500|$|Flight Unlimited {{was placed}} in direct {{competition}} with several major flight simulator franchises. Before the game's release, Shelby Bateman of Next Generation Magazine wrote, [...] "1995 {{is going to be}} a real dogfight in the flight-sim and aerial-combat categories, and LookingGlass [...] is betting its bankroll ... that it can capture significant market share from the likes of Microsoft Flight Simulator and the debut of Spectrum HoloByte's Falcon 4.0, among others." [...] Describing the situation, Johnny L. Wilson of Computer Gaming World wrote, [...] "The games that sell big are the ones that <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> blow stuff up, so, if anything, that could be a problem for Flight Unlimited." [...] Doug Church explained that, because the game did not feature combat and bore little resemblance to Microsoft Flight Simulator, the team spent [...] "many late nights" [...] on marketing strategies. However, he noted that the game had a wide appeal among those who tested it during development, which he called [...] "a really good sign". Talking to Bernie Yee of PC Gamer US, Paul Neurath said that he thought the game would sell well. Yee noted that Neurath [...] "fully [...] it to prove more popular than Microsoft Flight Simulator".|$|E
