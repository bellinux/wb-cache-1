CP violation in the process γγ → W + W − is investigated in detail with linearly polarized photon beams. There are two useful CP-odd asymmetries that do not require detailed information on W decay products. The sensitivity to the CP-odd form factors are studied quantitatively by assuming a perfect e-γ conversion and the 20 fb − 1 e + e − integrated luminosity at the e + e − c. m. energies √ s = 0. 5 and 1. 0 TeV. The sensitivity is so high that such experiments will allow us to probe new CP violation effects beyond the limits from some specific models with reasonable physics assumptions. We find that a counting experiment of W + W − events in the two-photon mode with <b>adjustable</b> laser <b>frequencies</b> can have much stronger sensitivity to the CP-odd γ(γ) WW form factors than can a W + W − decay-correlation experiment with a perfect detector achieve in the e + e − mode. 1 I...|$|R

40|$|Die casting is {{a common}} method of light metal {{processing}} {{which is used to}} produce accurately dimensioned, sharply defined metal parts. Most die casting machines in use today utilize a complex hydraulic system to perform the necessary work required for the process. The pressure and flow rate demands on the hydraulic system vary significantly throughout the cycle. Many older systems are greatly oversized so that they are able to meet the peak hydraulic demand at any point. These systems operate inefficiently because there is typically no way to limit the hydraulic capacity during periods of low demand. As a result, fluid is throttled to lower pressures and excess fluid flow is routed directly back to the system reservoir, wasting motor energy and increasing the thermal load on the cooling system. One option for improving the efficiency of older die casting machines currently in use is the retrofit of an <b>adjustable</b> <b>frequency</b> drive, or AFD. An AFD allows the speed of the pump motor to be varied, changing the pump output to suit the cycle demands. This minimizes the amount of wasted energy without affecting other process parameters. This paper will discuss the die casting process and examine the energy savings potential of retrofitting die casting machines with <b>adjustable</b> <b>frequency</b> drives...|$|E
