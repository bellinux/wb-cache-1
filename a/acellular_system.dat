Filtered BAL supernatant from COPD patients and healthy nonsmoking controls was examined by fluorometric analysis of DNA unwinding (FADU) and spectrophotometric assays (cytochrome c reduction kinetics and uric acid kinetics).

40|$|Searching for a {{physiological}} role of T 4 RNA ligase [polyribonucleotide synthetase (ATP); poly(ribonucleotide) :poly(ribonucleotide) ligase (AMP-forming), EC 6. 5. 1. 3] activity, we developed an <b>acellular</b> <b>system</b> of plasmolyzed Escherichia coli cells infected by T 4 bacteriophage. Upon incubation {{of this system}} with [gamma- 32 P]ATP, 32 P was transferred into {{a large number of}} polyribonucleotides, mostly up to 300 - 400 residues long. The bulk of 32 P in the product polyribonucleotides was found in 5 '-terminal phosphate groups, suggesting that they originated by a phosphorylation reaction catalyzed by the endogenous polynucleotide kinase (EC 2. 7. 1. 78). Indeed, these products were not seen in an <b>acellular</b> <b>system</b> from uninfected cells, and their amount and complexity increased with the progress of infection. Analysis of the 32 P-labeled polyribonucleotide products by gel electrophoresis, either before or after digestion with alkaline phosphatase (EC 3. 1. 3. 1), revealed that {{a small fraction of the}} 32 P resided in phosphodiester bonds of several tRNA-sized chains. This specific 32 P transfer from [gamma- 32 P]ATP into phosphodiester bonds was apparently catalyzed by successive polynucleotide kinase and RNA ligase reactions. The possible relationship of the 32 P transfer to RNA ligase was investigated next by using a system from cells infected with T 4 am M 69 (an amber mutant deficient in RNA ligase). Transfer of 32 P from [gamma- 32 P]ATP into phosphodiester bonds was not detected in the am M 69 system. However, addition of purified RNA ligase to the am M 69 system restored the specific 32 P transfer. A system from cells infected with T 4 psu-b delta 33 (a deletion mutant lacking the entire tRNA region) sustained the specific 32 P transfer into tRNA-sized products, indicating that they were not derived from transcripts of T 4 tRNA genes.

40|$|D-glucose (16. 7 mM) {{stimulates the}} {{synthesis}} of polyphosphoinositides in intact pancreatic islets prelabelled with tritiated myo-inositol and incubated {{in the absence of}} extracellular Ca 2 +. ATP (1. 0 mM) exerts a comparable effect in sonicates of pre-labelled normal or tumoral islet cells. In the <b>acellular</b> <b>system,</b> ATP fails to affect the generation of tritiated inositol phosphates in the absence of Ca 2 +, but augments the Ca 2 +-stimulated production of inositol mono-, bis- and triphosphates. The latter effect is not reproduced by α,β-methylene ATP, suggesting that it is not attributable to a purinergic mechanism. Whether in the absence or presence of ATP, the Ca 2 +-induced increment in inositol phosphates production coincides with a comparable decrease in tritiated polyphosphoinositides. It is proposed, therefore, that the increased production of inositol phosphates in intact islets stimulated by nutrient secretagogues is attributable, in part at least, to an accelerated generation of polyphosphoinositides, possibly resulting from a rise in cytosolic ATP concentration.

40|$|The {{literature}} on intracellular signal transduction presents a confusing picture: every regulatory factor {{appears to be}} regulated by all signal transduction cascades and to regulate all cell processes. This contrasts with the known exquisite specificity of action of extracellular signals in different cell types in vivo. The confusion of the in vitro literature is shown to arise from several causes: the inevitable artifacts inherent in reductionism, the arguments used to establish causal effect relationships, the use of less than adequate models (cell lines, transfections, <b>acellular</b> <b>systems,</b> etc.), and the implicit assumption that networks of regulations are universal whereas {{they are in fact}} cell and stage specific. Cell specificity results from the existence in any cell type of a unique set of proteins and their isoforms at each level of signal transduction cascades, from the space structure of their components, from their combinatorial logic at each level, from the presence of modulators of signal transduction proteins and of modulators of modulators, from the time structure of extracellular signals and of their transduction, and from quantitative differences of expression of similar sets of factors.

In dog thyroid slices, thyrotropin, dibutyl cyclic 3 ′: 5 ′‐adenosine monophosphate, and cyclic 3 ′: 5 ′‐AMP {{in the presence}} of caffeine, stimulated glucose oxidation at C‐ 1, [131 I]iodide binding to proteins and intracellular colloid droplet formation; no such effect was obtained with butyrate, 5 ′‐AMP, ADP, ATP or caffeine. The stimulation of [131 I]iodide binding to proteins and of glucose oxidation at C‐ 1 by low concentrations of thyrotropin (0. 5 mU/ml) was enhanced {{in the presence of}} caffeine.

40|$|Abstract: Retinoids, {{the active}} {{metabolites}} of vitamin A, regulate complex gene networks involved in vertebrate morphogenesis, growth, cellular differentiation, and homeostasis. They {{are used for}} the treatment of skin disorders and as chemopreventive agents for certain cancers. Molecular biology and genetic studies performed during the last 15 years in vitro, using either <b>acellular</b> <b>systems</b> or transfected cells, have shown that retinoid actions are mediated through heterodimers between the 8 major RARα, β, and γ isoforms and the 6 major RXRα, β, and γ isoforms that belong to the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily, and act as ligand-dependent transcriptional regulators. Furthermore, RXRs not only heterodimerize with RARs, but also with numerous other members of the NR superfamily. As in vitro studies are carried out under nonphysiological conditions, they only indicate what is possible, but not necessarily what is actually occurring in vivo. Therefore, mutations have been introduced by homologous recombination (HR) in F 9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, a cell-autonomous system that differentiates in the presence of RA, in order to disrupt RAR and RXR genes and establish their cellular and molecular functions in RA-induced differentiation.

40|$|The {{full-length}} ZipA protein from Escherichia coli, one of {{the essential}} components of the division proto-ring that provides membrane tethering to the septation FtsZ protein, has been incorporated in single copy into nanodiscs formed by a membrane scaffold protein encircling an E. coli phospholipid mixture. This is an <b>acellular</b> <b>system</b> that reproduces the assembly of part of the cell division components. ZipA contained in nanodiscs (Nd-ZipA) retains the ability to interact with FtsZ oligomers and with FtsZ polymers. Interactions with FtsZ occur at similar strengths as {{those involved in the}} binding of the soluble form of ZipA, lacking the transmembrane region, suggesting that the transmembrane region of ZipA has little influence on the formation of the ZipA·plex. Peptides containing partial sequences of the C terminus of FtsZ compete with FtsZ polymers for binding to Nd-ZipA. The affinity of Nd-ZipA for the FtsZ polymer formed with GTP or GMPCPP (a slowly hydrolyzable analog of GTP) is moderate (micromolar range) and of similar magnitude as for FtsZ-GDP oligomers. Polymerization does not stabilize the binding of FtsZ to ZipA. This supports the role of ZipA as a passive anchoring device for the proto-ring with little implication, if any, in the regulation of its assembly. Furthermore, it indicates that the tethering of FtsZ to the membrane shows sufficient plasticity to allow for its release from noncentral regions of the cytoplasmic membrane and its subsequent relocation to midcell when demanded by the assembly of a division ring.

Also, due to its similarity to diethylstilbestrol, a known human carcinogen, BPA has been investigated for its genotoxic and carcinogenic properties, but {{the results have been}} either inconclusive or controversial. Metabolically activated BPA has previously been shown to form DNA adducts both in vitro and in rat liver. The present study was designed (a) to assess the sensitivity threshold of DNA-adduct detection by 32 P-postlabelling in an <b>acellular</b> <b>system</b> and (b) to evaluate the formation of DNA adducts in both liver and mammary cells of female CD- 1 mice receiving BPA in their drinking water (200 mg/kg body weight) for eight consecutive days.

Administration of BPA to mice confirmed that DNA adducts are formed in liver (3. 4 -fold higher levels than in controls). In addition, new evidence is provided that DNA adducts are formed in target mammary cells (4. 7 -fold higher than in controls).

We have investigated whether such an AA-oxidizing action might be provided by plasma membrane gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), previously shown to function as an autocrine source of prooxidants.

First, the target organisms {Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were incubated for 60 min with josamycin, erythromycin or control buffer prior {{to use in}} a human polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) killing assay. Second the macrolides were added directly to acellular killing systems mimicking those acting inside the phagolysosome; oxygen-independent systems were obtained from a crude granule extract of PMN and oxygen-dependent systems consisted either of a mixture of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase or of a solution of H 2 O 2. Whereas josamycin-pretreated P. aeruginosa were twice as sensitive to killing by PMN than were control cells, {{this was not the}} case for S. aureus. Both oxidant generating systems were more effective in destroying S. aureus in the presence of josamycin (3 and 30 mg/ 1). Erythromycin showed a similar synergy but only with the xanthine plus xanthine oxidase system. This synergy was observed with neither of the Oj-independent systems for S. aureus, nor with any <b>acellular</b> <b>system</b> for P. aeruginosa. These data suggest that at least two kinds of mechanism may explain the bactericidal synergy observed between macrolides and PMN. The first (for macrolide-resistant species such as P. aeruginosa) could be due to alterations in the bacteria by the antibiotics, while the second (for macrolide-sensitive species such as 5. aureus) could be based upon an as yet unexplained transformation of the molecules by reactive oxygen species into more "toxic " forms.

Interstitial pulmonary diseases have recently been reported in workers from ITO producing plants. The present study was conducted to identify experimentally the exact chemical component responsible for this toxicity and to address possible mechanisms of action. The reactivity of respirable ITO particles was compared with that of its single components alone or their unsintered 90 : 10 mixture (MIX) both in vivo and in vitro. For all endpoints considered, ITO particles behaved as a specific toxic entity. In vivo, after a single pharyngeal administration (2 - 20 mg per rat), ITO particles induced a strong inflammatory reaction. At day 3, the inflammatory reaction (cell accumulation, LDH and protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) appeared more marked with ITO particles than with each oxide separately or the MIX. This inflammatory reaction persisted and even worsened after 15 days. After 60 days, this inflammation was still present but no significant fibrotic response was observed. The cytotoxicity of ITO was assessed in vitro in lung epithelial cells (RLE) and macrophages (NR 8383 cell line). While ITO particles (up to 200 microg/ml) did not affect epithelial cell integrity (LDH release), a strong cytotoxic response was found in macrophages exposed to ITO, but not to its components alone or mixed. ITO particles also induced an increased frequency of micronuclei in type II pneumocytes in vivo but not in RLE in vitro, suggesting the preponderance of a secondary genotoxic mechanism. To address the possible mechanism of ITO toxicity, reactive oxygen species production was assessed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry in an <b>acellular</b> <b>system.</b> Carbon centered radicals (COO-.) and Fenton-like activity were detected in the presence of ITO particles, not with In(2) O(3), SnO(2) alone, or the MIX. Because the unsintered mixture of SnO(2) and In(2) O(3) particles was unable to reproduce the reactivity/toxicity of ITO particles, the sintering process through which SnO(2) molecules are introduced within the crystal structure of In(2) O(3) appears critical to explain the unique toxicological properties of ITO.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Cases of {{pulmonary}} diseases {{caused by}} Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) have {{increased over the}} years and have become a major health concern in Europe, Asia, and the United States. MAC, comprised of M. avium species and M. intracellulare, are found everywhere in the environment: in water sources and the soil. Their abilities to form biofilm in municipal water sources and their resistance to antimicrobial agents increase the risk of being exposed to this environmental pathogen and render treatment to MAC infections difficult, respectively. Upon ingestion or inhalation of contaminated water droplets, these opportunistic pathogens colonize the host and might cause nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung infection in patients with pre-existing lung pathology and disseminated disease in individuals with severe immunosuppression. Like Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. avium survives and replicates within phagosomes. It has evolved different mechanisms to evade host immune responses like blocking phagosome-lysosome fusion, and altering the uptake of iron inside phagosomes. Iron and other metals like copper are required for bacterial growth and protein synthesis. One defense mechanism that host cells use to block the replication of intracellular pathogens inside phagosomes is to restrict the availability of nutrients, iron and other metal ions inside the vacuole or to accumulate certain metal that becomes toxic to the microorganisms. Sensing host environmental changes is key for the pathogen intracellular survival. ￼ Many environmental cues including the single metal element are factors known to influence bacterial gene expression and virulence gene in pathogenic microorganisms like Salmonella, Shigella, or Yersinia. In Yersinia, calcium modulates the expression of the type III secretion system, which is responsible for the delivery of Yop effector proteins directly into the host cell cytosol. It is well known that bacterial secreted proteins have the ability to manipulate or modify host cells signaling pathways. Here, we were interested in identifying M. avium secreted protein inside the phagosome. Yet studying protein secretion inside host cells can be technically challenging and complex. For these reasons, an in vitro <b>acellular</b> <b>system,</b> established by Early and colleagues, which mimics the vacuole environment (metal element concentration and pH) of the phagosome at 24 hours post-infection (24 hrs elemental mixture), was used to identify M. avium secreted proteins.

In this work, we aim (1) to confirm the secretion of 10 out of 55 secreted proteins identified from the M. avium culture supernatant using the beta-lactamase assay, and (2) to determine whether M. avium exposure to the elemental mixture induced gene expression or just triggered a secretory mechanism. By confirming the secretion of these 10 selected proteins inside macrophages, we will establish an in vitro system in studying M. avium protein secretion. Moreover, knowing whether the elemental mixture induces the gene expression of these 10 selected proteins or is just triggering a secretory mechanism will provide a better understanding on the effect the elemental mixture may have on M. avium...|$|E

Homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells has been used to generate germline null mutations of the RAR- and RXR-coding genes in the mouse. As reviewed here, the generation of such germline mutations, combined with pharmacological approaches to block the RA signalling pathway, has provided genetic evidence that RAR/RXR heterodimers are indeed the functional units transducing the RA signal during prenatal development. However, due to (i) the complexity in "hormonal" signalling through transduction by the multiple RARs and RXRs, (ii) the functional redundancies (possibly artefactually generated by the mutations) within receptor isotypes belonging to a given family, and (iii) in utero or early postnatal lethality of certain germline null mutations, these genetic studies have failed to reveal all the physiological functions of RARs and RXRs, notably in adults. Spatio-temporally-controlled somatic mutations generated in given cell types/tissues and at chosen times during postnatal life, will be required to reveal all the functions of RAR and RXR throughout the lifetime of the mouse...|$|R

Hence, Okazaki pieces in simian virus 40 are synthesized against the DNA replication fork direction...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral nerves {{possess the}} {{capacity}} of self-regeneration after traumatic injury. Transected peripheral nerves can be bridged by direct surgical coaptation of the two nerve stumps or by interposing autografts or biological (veins) or synthetic nerve conduits (NC). NC are tubular structures that guide the regenerating axons to the distal nerve stump. Early synthetic NC have primarily been made of silicone because of the relative flexibility and biocompatibility of this material and because medical-grade silicone tubes were readily available in various dimensions. Nowadays, NC are preferably made of biodegradable materials such as collagen, aliphatic polyesters, or polyurethanes. Although NC assist in guiding regenerating nerves, satisfactory functional restoration of severed nerves may further require exogenous growth factors. Therefore, authors have proposed NC with integrated delivery systems for growth factors or growth factor-producing cells. This article reviews the most important designs of NC with integrated delivery systems for localized release of growth factors. The various systems discussed comprise NC with growth factors being released from various types of matrices, from transplanted cells (Schwann cells or mesenchymal stem cells), or through genetic modification of cells naturally present {{at the site of}} injured tissue. <b>Acellular</b> delivery <b>systems</b> for growth factors include the NC wall itself, biodegradable microspheres seeded onto the internal surface of the NC wall, or matrices that are filled into the lumen of the NC and immobilize the growth factors through physical-chemical interactions or specific ligand-receptor interactions. A very promising and elegant system appears to be longitudinally aligned fibers inserted in the lumen of a NC that deliver the growth factors and provide additional guidance for Schwann cells and axons. This review also attempts to appreciate the most promising approaches and emphasize the importance of growth factor delivery kinetics...|$|R
40|$|A {{nanoparticle}} {{drug carrier}} {{system has been}} developed to alter the cellular uptake and chemotherapeutic performance of an available chemotherapeutic drug. The system comprises of a multifunctional gold nanoparticle based drug delivery system (Au-PEG-PAMAM-DOX) as a novel platform for intracellular delivery of doxorubicin (DOX). Spherical gold nanoparticles were synthesized by a gold chloride reduction, stabilized with thiolated polyethylene glycol (PEG) and then covalently coupled with a polyamidoamine (PAMAM) G 4 dendrimer. Further, conjugation of an anti-cancer drug doxorubicin to the dendrimer via amide bond resulted in Au-PEG-PAMAM-DOX drug delivery <b>system.</b> <b>Acellular</b> drug release studies proved that DOX released from Au-PEG-PAMAM-DOX at physiological pH was negligible but it was significantly increased at a weak acidic milieu. The intracellular drug release was monitored with confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis. In vitro viability studies showed {{an increase in the}} associated doxorubicin cytotoxicity not attributed to carrier components indicating the efficiency of the doxorubicin was improved, upon conjugation to the nano system. As such it is postulated that the developed pH triggered multifunctional doxorubicin-gold nanoparticle system, could lead to a promising platform for intracellular delivery of variety of anticancer drugs...|$|R
40|$|With the aim {{to search}} and design more {{effective}} and safe antioxidant molecules {{to be used as}} functional ingredients in cosmetic formulations for UV protection, we evaluated the antioxidant/radical scavenging activities of ferulic acid and of some alkyl ferulates in both <b>acellular</b> and cellular <b>systems.</b> Ferulic acid esters, equipotent as antioxidant in homogeneous phase, showed when tested in membranous systems (rat liver microsomes, rat erythrocytes) marked differences in antioxidant potency. The n-C 12 derivative was the most potent, followed by n-C 8, n-C 16 and branched C 8, and then by ferulic acid. A conformational study carried out by NMR and modelling, indicates that the different antioxidant activity of ferulates in membrane models is due to the different spatial conformation and arrangement of the side chain of the molecule, which governs the access and binding to the phospholipid bilayer, the modality of orientation of the scavenging/quenching nucleus (phenol moiety), and hence the overall antioxidant potency of the derivative. These results emphasize the need of analytical studies (NMR and molecular modelling) addressed to the knowledge of the conformational parameters in combination with conventional antioxidant testings for understanding the antioxidant behaviour of a molecule in a biological membrane/system...|$|R

RNDr. Lucie Zemanová, Ph. D. Title of diploma thesis: Function and {{determination}} of sulfotransferase {{in the skin}} Sulfotransferases (SULTs) are enzymes that are expressed in small intestine, muscles, prostate and also in smaller amounts in placenta, trachea, lungs and skin, where they participate on sulfonation of steroid hormones, neurotransmiters {{as well as other}} endogenous molecules. SULTs are important for biotransformation processes of many xenobiotics. Cholesterol sulfotransferase (SULT 2 B 1 b) is one of the significant transferases in the skin, whose function is to catalyze transfer of sulfo group to cholesterol molecule. SULT 2 B 1 b {{plays an important role in}} skin barrier formation and also in skin aging. Cholesterol sulphate (CHS) is a product of sulfonation of cholesterol by SULT 2 B 1 b in epidermis. CHS belongs to epidermal lipids. CHS participates on forming of skin barrier and on desquamation. The aim of study was to find an optimal method and conditions for measuring the activity of SULT 2 B 1 b. It was necessary to find a method for determination of enzyme activity in also <b>acellular</b> and cellular <b>systems.</b> Two types of reaction from [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{review the}} oncological safety and {{aesthetic}} advantage of skin-sparing mastectomy (SSM) for invasive breast cancer (IBC) and ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS). Controversies including {{the impact of}} radiotherapy (RT) on immediate breast reconstruction (IBR), preservation of the nipple-areola complex (NAC) {{and the role of}} endoscopic mastectomy are also considered. Methods: Literature review using Medline and PubMed. Results: SSM is safe in selected cases; including IBC 5 cm, multi-centric tumours, DCIS and for risk-reduction surgery. Inflammatory breast cancers and tumours with extensive involvement of the skin represent contra-indications to SSM due to an unacceptable risk of local recurrence. SSM can facilitate IBR and is associated with an excellent aesthetic result. Prior breast irradiation or the need for post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) do not preclude SSM, however the cosmetic outcome may be adversely affected. Nipple/areola preservation is safe for peripherally located node negative tumours. A frozen section protocol for the retro-areolar tissue should be considered in these cases. The advent of <b>acellular</b> tissue matrix <b>systems</b> has widened the applicability of implant-based immediate reconstruction following SSM. Data on endoscopic mastectomy is limited and superiority over conventional SSM has not been demonstrated. Conclusion: SSM is safe in selected cases and is associated with advantages over simple mastectomy, including a superior aesthetic outcome and a potential {{reduction in the number of}} reconstructive procedures per patient. </p...|$|R
40|$|Coelenterazine (3, 7 -dihydro- 2 -(p-hydroxybenzyl) - 6 -(p -hydroxyphenyl) - 8 -benzylimidazolo [1, 2 -a]pyrazin- 3 -one) is a {{substrate}} for the bioluminescence {{reaction in}} many marine animals, Recent work showed that CLZn, its synthetic analogue CLZm, and their common oxidation product coelenteramine (CLM) have strong antioxidative properties in <b>acellular</b> lipid peroxidation <b>systems</b> {{as well as}} in rat hepatocytes subjected to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP). Here, we analyzed the ability of CLZm and several imidazolopyrazinone (IMPZs) analogues to protect primary cultures of rat hepatocytes against a nitrofurantoin (NF) -induced oxidative stress. Comparison of protection capabilities with reference antioxidants yielded the following ranking: CLZm >>> BHT > Trolox C (R) > prohucol > alpha -tocopherol. The comparison of CLZm with analogues lacking the phenol group in R- 1 revealed no differences although the presence of this phenol conferred superior protection against t-BHP. CLM, as well as its methoxylated analogue mCLM which lacks chain-breaking properties, were equally potent in preventing cellular damage caused by NF. mCLM and alpha -naphthoflavone, an inhibitor of cytochrome P 450 (CYP 450) IAI, similarly protected cells against NF-induced mortality and also equally inhibited EROD activity in methylcholanthrene-induced hepatocytes. The inhibition of EROD by CLZm and CLM was less pronounced. We suggest that the extent of protection conferred by IMPZs against NF-toxicity reflects both the occurrence of antioxidative properties detoxifying ROS produced within cells and inhibitory actions on CYP 450 isoforms involved in the bioreduction of NF...|$|R
