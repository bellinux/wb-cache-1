50|$|The early {{firmware}} for version 2 units (firmware version {{information is}} under Settings >> Info) removed {{the ability for}} unsupported operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD, etc.) to see the internal storage as a standard flash drive when plugged in via the USB port. Version 1 players had a menu option under the Settings menu for storage mode that could be toggled to show up as standard USB flash drive. For V2 Sansa players with firmware version V03.01.11, this option has been completely removed from the settings menu. Upgrading to later firmware versions, V03.01.14 or V03.01.16 will restore the USB Mode menu option under the Settings menu. Under the USB Mode menu are three choices - <b>Auto</b> <b>Detect,</b> Media Transfer Protocol (MTP), and USB mass-storage class (MSC).

40|$|Current {{hexahedral}} mesh generation techniques {{rely on a}} set of meshing tools, which {{when combined}} with geometry decomposition leads to an adequate mesh generation process. Of these tools, sweeping tends to be the workhorse algorithm, accounting for at least 50 % of most meshing applications. Constraints which must be met for a volume to be sweepable are derived, and it is proven that these constraints are necessary but not sufficient conditions for sweepability. This paper also describes a new algorithm for detecting extruded or sweepable geometries. This algorithm, based on these constraints, uses topological and local geometric information, and is more robust than feature recognition-based algorithms. A method for computing sweep dependencies in volume assemblies is also given. The <b>auto</b> sweep <b>detect</b> and sweep grouping algorithms have been used to reduce interactive user time required to generate all-hexahedral meshes by filtering out non-sweepable volumes needing further decomposition and by allowing concurrent meshing of independent sweep groups. Parts of the <b>auto</b> sweep <b>detect</b> algorithm have also been used to identify independent sweep paths, for use in volume-based interval assignment...|$|R

5000|$|Windows 3.0 {{includes}} a Protected/Enhanced mode which allows Windows applications {{to use more}} memory in a more painless manner than their DOS counterparts could. It can run in any of Real, Standard, or 386 Enhanced modes, and is compatible with any Intel processor from the 8086/8088 up to 80286 and 80386. Windows 3.0 tries to <b>auto</b> <b>detect</b> which mode to run in, although it can be forced to run in a specific mode using the switches: /r (real mode), /s ("standard" [...] 286 protected mode) and /3 (386 enhanced protected mode) respectively. Since Windows 3.0 (and later Windows 3.1) runs in 16-bit 286 protected mode and not 32-bit 386 protected mode, the default setup {{is to use the}} 64 KB segmented memory model. However, on 32-bit CPUs, the programmer had access to larger memory pointers and so it was possible to expand program segments to whatever size was desired (the maximum limit being 16 MB due to segment descriptors being 24-bit). Since Windows API functions were 16-bit at the time, they could not use 32-bit pointers and thus it was necessary to place the portion of the program code that performed OS calls in a 64 KB segment, like in DOS, although 32-bit instructions may be contained in the code. (Ami Pro was the first Windows application to require a 386). Because of this, Windows 3.0 can access only 16 MB total of RAM, even on 386 or higher CPUs which have a theoretical capability of utilizing 4GB.|$|E

Depending on the results of graphical simulating algorithm on cases study, we can discover that a dynamic quantum is very suitable to accommodate low priority processes that still for a long duration to complete their requests, i. e. avoid the starvation of CPU- bounded processes. Although, it stills compatible with high priority processes (I/O-Bounded) to provide a fair interactivity with them. In comparison to traditional MLFQ the performance of the new scheduling technique is better and practical according to the applied results.

40|$|The Orbital Systems Company {{faces the}} really {{important}} issues such a lack of water, sewerage and even public health infrastructure. Its proposition of the Shower of the Future, which is a high-tech purification system that recycles water {{was inspired by the}} NASA, spaceship technology with limited sources of water and can be the solution of these problems. Due to the patented technology, which bases on the special filters, it is possible to reuse water. This idea, which is used in the shower, allows on more than 90 % savings in water usage and 80 % savings in energy, while producing water that is cleaner than average tap water. The company aims to provide this special technology not only to the hotels or hospitals, but also to the regular house to maintain the sustainability issue and even achieve the economic profit. The Shower of the Future is a new technology still in the developing phase. To achieve the goals of the company, in the software part of the system, two important problems have to be solved. First of them is the management issue. At this moment, three different versions of the showers, which differ in hardware and in software are in used. Much more versions adjusted to the place of destination such as hotel or hospital are planned. To manage the codes and integrate all of the possible version of the shower, the company desires to create one compatible software to control all of them. The mechanisms to integrate the codes by managing the configurable parameters of the system and to <b>auto</b> <b>detect</b> the version of the shower are proposed in the work. The second company’s issue is the improvement of the control system. As performed research and tests show, the temperature control in the Shower of the Future is too slow and inaccurate. To solve this problem, the identification process of the model was conducted and the PID controllers for the heater were designed. Due to specific structure of the shower, which introduce delays and disturbances, a single PID controller is not sufficient to maintain the control system. As a final controller, the switching PID controller created from previously designed PID controllers is proposed. Thanks to it, the temperature rising time is reduced 2 times, the overshoot, which was equal to 5 °C does not appear and the steady state error is diminished. Thanks to improvement of the temperature control system, much less water is wasted and much more energy is saved. The Shower of the Future of the Orbital System, which nevertheless needs improvements and more work, is only the first step in creating a new paradigm for daily water usage. The company and its product seriously consider the sustainability and environment aspect...|$|E

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to isolate target bacteria in high background microbiota food matrices. This is certainly the case for isolating Shigellae from foods such as apple juice, potato salad, bagged peeled carrots, whole romaine lettuce, alfalfa sprouts, and green onions. A comparison of current methods was performed using USFDA Bacterial Analytical Method (BAM), USFDA 2009 modified Produce Assignment, Pathatrix IMS, and KingFisher Flex. Using {{the results from the}} comparisons, a novel streamlined method named Pathatrix-KingFisher was created for detecting and isolating Shigellae in green onions. The Immunomagnetic Separation (IMS) technology used by Pathatrix Auto and KingFisher Flex instruments aided in screening and recovery of Shigellae. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the USFDA 2009 modified Produce Assignment with my novel Pathatrix-KingFisher method on green onions was performed. Food samples were artificially inoculated with < 30 CFU/ 25 g of a previously - 80 ??C frozen Shigella flexneri 2457 M culture, and compared with no-spike controls and no-matrix controls. All methods were evaluated at 5 h and/or 24 h post-incubation for their detection and isolation efficacy. Presumptive positive isolates were confirmed to be Shigellae using TSI slants and/or qPCR with primers to the Shigellae specific ipaH gene. The USFDA BAM method was able to detect and recover Shigellae on processed foods (for example, apple juice, potato salad, bagged peeled carrots, whole romaine lettuce), but not for food with high background microbiota (for example, alfalfa sprouts and green onions). The USFDA 2009 modified Produce Assignment method was inconsistent at detecting and isolating Shigellae from all foods. The Pathatrix IMS method was effective at detecting Shigellae in foods, but was ineffective at isolating Shigellae. Both the Pathatrix IMS and KingFisher Flex were able to detect Shigellae using qPCR consistently after 5 h of incubation. The recoveries at 5 h incubation, even with the help of IMS from the two instruments, were inconsistent. Shigellae were detected and isolated regularly after 24 h of incubation using the KingFisher Flex. When compared to the USFDA 2009 modified Produce Assignment method, both the IMS methods were more consistent in detecting and isolating Shigellae in green onions. By using both instruments, my novel method, Pathatrix-KingFisher, takes advantage of the sensitivity of Pathatrix Auto sample size and the automation of the KingFisher Flex???s 96 - well format to generate consistent high-throughput results. Two automated platforms using immunomagnetic separation technology were compared for detecting and recovering Escherichia coli O 157 in ground beef and sprouts and Shigella flexneri in green onions.

40|$|Purpose: Investigating the {{capabilities}} of commercial CAD/CAM systems in producing 3 D models of body bones from 2 D medical images and application of resulting models in rapid manufacturing of customized implants. Design/methodology/approach: Geometrical information of 2 D medical images extracted via an image processing and filtering mechanism, and converted into 3 D models by Commercial CAD software systems. After applying a median filter {{to improve the quality}} of 2 D images, they are segmented and bone edges are detected with histogram threshold method. With the aid of an <b>Auto</b> LISP program, <b>detected</b> edges are transferred to AutoCAD as a series of points. Splines are drawn over the points and redundant points deleted. Then by transferring resulted splines into the modeler, 3 D models are constructed. Different implant manufacturing methods have been studied and rapid manufacturing methods have been recognized to be suitable for customized implant fabrication. Findings: A number of CAD software packages proved to be capable of producing 3 D models using generated information, however, human intervention is needed for all systems tested. Different systems tested exhibited strenthnesses and weaknesses. Research limitations/implications: Automatic generation of 3 D models of body bones from 2 D images is desirable. Also development of an intelligent system for manufacturing of customized implants is highly desirable. Originality/value: Method of extracting geometric data from medical images and presenting this data in a format suitable for commercial CAD systems for making 3 D models is of high value.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, I have shown evidence that acid treatment of washed normal platelets followed by formalin-fixation {{serves as a}} suitable material to <b>detect</b> <b>auto</b> and allo antibodies to platelets by flow cytometry. The percentage of fluorescence positive cells (% FPC) was less than 20. 0 for fifty healthy adults. In this paper, I determined the levels of platelet bound IgG (PBIgG) in 20 patients with chronic ITP and in 27 patients with SLE. The % FPC in chronic ITP ranged from 97. 1 to 8. 3 (44. 7 ± 29. 4, mean±SD), and that for SLE from 99. 5 to 9. 3 (38. 8 ± 23. 9, mean±SD). In the patients with chronic ITP, a clearly inverted correlation was observed between platelet count and % FPCs (r=- 0. 6511, p＜ 0. 01). Next, the captured enzyme liked sorbent assay (ELISA) and the immunoblotting assay were performed on these serum specimens. In captured ELISA, anti GPⅠb or Ⅱb/Ⅲa complex, mouse monoclonal antibodies designed by Ⅰbl and CP 8 (provided by Dr. Zimmerman at Scripps Clinics), were used as the solid phase antibody to micro plate and 1 % Triton X- 100 soluble fraction of platelet lysate was used for epitope antigen to these MoAbs.
