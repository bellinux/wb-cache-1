40|$|The {{ability of}} a siderophore-catabolizing {{bacterium}} to assimilate ferric ion was examined. While the bacterium utilizes the siderophore deferrioxamine B (DFB) <b>as</b> <b>a</b> carbon <b>source,</b> it was incapable of using the ferricion analogue (ferrioxamine B) <b>as</b> <b>an</b> iron <b>source.</b> It did, however, assimilate the ferric ion of the chelator ferric nitrilotriacetic acid and of the siderophore ferrirhodotorulic acid (ferriRA). Neither ferriRA nor its deferrated analog (RA), however, were capable of functioning as carbon sources for the bacterium. The microbe thus employs a nutritional selectivity with respect to these two siderophores. That is, it does not use the siderophore it employs <b>as</b> <b>a</b> carbon <b>source</b> (DFB) <b>as</b> <b>an</b> iron <b>source</b> nor does the siderophore utilized <b>as</b> <b>an</b> iron <b>source,</b> i. e. ferriRA, nor its deferrated analog (RA), serve as carbon sources for the organism. <br /...|$|R
