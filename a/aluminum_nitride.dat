40|$|Abstract — Enhancement of {{hardness}} and {{corrosion resistance}} of aluminum alloys persist {{as an important}} challenge {{in order to increase}} the lifetime of industrial parts and accessories. This improvement of surface properties must be accomplished by low cost and minimum environmental impact processes. On these considerations, in the present work DC pulsed plasma nitriding at rough vacuum (1. 9 torr) was carried out on 6061 aluminum alloy using different N 2 /Ar mixtures (100 / 0, 50 / 50 and 75 / 50) to sustain the DC glow discharge. Influence of gas mixture on surface morphology, hardness, phases composition and corrosion performance was evaluated through scanning electron microscopy, Vickers micro indentation, X-ray diffraction and potentiodynamic polarization curves (3. 5 % NaCl), respectively. For the better evaluated case (50 N 2 / 50 Ar mixture), results show the increase in surface hardness from 113 to 148 HV 0. 025, and the decrease in the corrosion current value to an a half respect untreated sample. The increasing in hardness and corrosion performance of evaluated aluminum alloy was attributed to the chemical surface modification by formation of a thin layer constituted by cubic and hexagonal <b>aluminum</b> <b>nitrides...</b>|$|R

The base material stress–strain curves exhibit concomitant decrease of the yield point effect magnitude and increase of the strain hardening rate with the temperature, but only up to a critical value, which decreases with increasing the strain rate. After vanishing at this critical temperature, the yield point effect reappears upon the onset of sample necking responsible for the ensuing continuous decrease of the engineering stress. The strain–stress curves of laser welds show no yield point effect and the work hardening persists at all temperatures.

The specimens were characterized {{with respect to}} the following properties: wear resistance, hardness of nitrided layer (AlN layer), surface and cross sectional microstructures. The friction coefficient of nitrided AA 5052 decreased to 0. 2 and that of Al- 7 %Si was improved to 0. 1. The AlN layers were relatively uniformly formed on the AA 5052 and AC 4 C alloys with a thickness of 4. 5 µm and 2. 5 µm during 2 hrs and 5. 4 ks, respectively. On the surface of nitrided AA 5083, a uniform AlN layer was not formed due to the high nitriding temperature. The Si 3 N 4 was found in the nitrided AC 4 C alloy.
