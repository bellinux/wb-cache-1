The reported weather conditions at the airport were adequate for this type of approach, but visibility was irregular and deteriorating rapidly. Stafford began to follow See's plane, but when he lost sight of it in the clouds he instead followed the standard procedure for a missed approach <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> aircraft up, back into the clouds for another attempt at an instrument landing.|$|E

Three years after Johnson recalled and ceased production of all CFC products, the U.S. government corroborated the research of the substance’s harmful effects and unilaterally banned CFCs. Johnson was praised for his early decision.|$|E
25|$|That morning, Federal patrols {{detected}} both threats. Not {{knowing where}} the Confederate main body was located, Curtis sent Dodge's brigade of Col. Eugene A. Carr's 4th Division northeast up the Wire Road {{to join the}} 24th Missouri Infantry at Elkhorn Tavern. But Dodge, still worried about {{the threat to the}} Federal rear, had disobeyed orders <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> brigade back to Pratt's Store, available to immediately reinforce Elkhorn. Curtis also sent a task force under Col. Peter J. Osterhaus north to reconnoiter along Ford Road. Osterhaus' force consisted of Col. Nicholas Greusel's brigade of his own 1st Division, several cavalry units led by Col. Cyrus Bussey, and twelve cannons.|$|E

2500|$|On February 25,1881, Faro dealer Luke Short and {{professional}} gambler and gunfighter Charlie Storms {{got into an}} argument. Storms had successfully defended himself several times with his pistol. He had inaccurately sized Short up as someone he could [...] "slap in the face without expecting a return." [...] Bat Masterson initially defused a confrontation between the two men, but Storms returned, yanked Short off the sidewalk, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> cut-off Colt [...]45 pistol. Luke Short was quicker <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> own pistol, shooting Charlie Storms twice before he hit the ground. The first shot was so close it set fire to Storms' shirt.|$|E

Bull retreated to his room, quickly wrote down a {{makeshift}} will for the disposition of his property in the event of his death then took his gun. Peel waited in the saloon, but after an hour he though that Bull had already fled from his challenge, and therefore left.|$|E

2500|$|Surrey made 1964 Barrington's Benefit {{year and}} {{with a variety of}} cricket and {{football}} matches, dances other fundraisers he made £10,702, the sixth highest earning benefit at the time, and enough money to buy a newly built four bedroom detached house in Feltham. Barrington's great friend Bobby Simpson led the Australian cricket team in England in 1964, strong in batting, but weak in bowling. The first two Tests were rain-soaked draws and they went to Headingley for the Third Test with Barrington having done little – his last 10 innings in England had produced 200 runs. Ted Dexter was back in charge and famously removed Fred Titmus from the attack just after he had taken 3 wickets. He gave the new ball to Fred Trueman who served up short-balls to Peter Burge who hooked <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> way to 160 to give Australia a 121 run lead in the first innings. England's reply depended heavily on Barrington who made 85 (the next highest score was 32) until he had an unlucky lbw decision and they were all out for 229. Australia easily made 111/3 to win and go 1–0 up in the series. The Fourth Test at Old Trafford saw Simpson winning the toss and making the first Test century of his career, 311 in Australia's 656/8. In reply Barrington made his first Test century in England and his highest Test score; 256 in 683 minutes with 26 fours and adding 246 for the third wicket with Dexter; [...] "It was a spirited reply that captured the imagination, but the inevitable draw meant that the Ashes stayed with Australia". It is the third highest score for England against Australia after Len Hutton's 364 and R.E. Foster's 287 and is the highest since the Second World War. Before he started his innings his wife had sent him a telegram Vincit qui patitur (he who endures conquers). He was lbw to McKenzie and England made 611, the first time that two teams had made 600 runs in an innings in the same Test. A few days later his smashed 83 in 27 minutes at Reading in one of his benefit matches, hitting 7 sixes, breaking the pavilion roof and followed this up with 207 against Nottinghamshire to give him back-to-back first-class double centuries. In the Fifth Test Trueman took his 300th Test wicket, Geoff Boycott made his maiden Test century and Barrington made 47 and 54 not out, but the rain guaranteed a draw and Australia won the series 1–0. Barrington made 531 runs (75.85) – more than anyone else on either side and only Simpson averaged higher with his 458 runs (76.33) – as he began the most fruitful period of his career.|$|E
