30|$|The {{following}} definitions {{were used}} for study parameters: True positive (TP) scans <b>were</b> <b>those</b> in which a breast lesion was histologically proven to be an invasive breast cancer or a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). True negative (TN) scans <b>were</b> <b>those</b> without a suspicious lesion seen on imaging and no breast cancer was diagnosed in the next 12  months. False negative (FN) scans <b>were</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> did not detect a suspicious breast lesion, but a breast cancer was detected in the following 12  months. False positive (FP) scans <b>were</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> resulted in biopsy that was subsequently benign. Sensitivity (Se) was defined as TPR = TP/(TP + FN), and specificity (Sp) was defined as TNR = TN/(TN + FP).|$|R
5|$|The {{components}} in an electric circuit {{can take many}} forms, which can include elements such as resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers and electronics. Electronic circuits contain active components, usually semiconductors, and typically exhibit non-linear behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> are termed passive and linear: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.|$|E
5|$|They {{are likely}} to be found in valley regions that exhibit diurnal {{mountain}} wind systems, such as those of the dry mountain ranges of the US. Deep valleys that terminate abruptly at a plain are more impacted by these factors than <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> gradually become shallower as downvalley distance increases.|$|E

5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> are formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, {{he has to go}} where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E
5|$|Anamorphic or {{imperfect}} fungi <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> seem to lack a sexual stage {{in their life}} cycle, and typically reproduce {{by the process of}} mitosis in structures called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage—or teleomorph stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The anamorphic state of S.coccinea is Molliardiomyces dudleyi.|$|E

This form produces smooth, colorless conidiophores (specialized stalks that bear conidia) measuring 20–230 by 2–3.2µm. The conidia are roughly spherical to , smooth, translucent (hyaline), and 4.6–7.0 by 3.0–3.8µm.|$|E
