The transcription factors Mrr 1 and Cap 1 mediate MDR 1 upregulation in response to inducing stimuli, and gain-of-function mutations in Mrr 1 or Cap 1, which render the transcription factors hyperactive, result in constitutive MDR 1 overexpression. The essential MADS box transcription factor Mcm 1 also binds to the MDR 1 promoter, but its role in inducible or constitutive MDR 1 upregulation is unknown. Using a conditional mutant in which Mcm 1 can be depleted from the cells, we investigated the importance of Mcm 1 for MDR 1 expression. We found that Mcm 1 was dispensable for MDR 1 upregulation by H 2 O 2 but was required for full MDR 1 induction by benomyl. A C-terminally truncated, hyperactive Cap 1 could upregulate MDR 1 expression both in the presence {{and in the absence}} of Mcm 1. In contrast, a hyperactive Mrr 1 containing a gain-of-function mutation depended on Mcm 1 to cause MDR 1 overexpression. These results demonstrate a differential requirement for the coregulator Mcm 1 for Cap 1 - and Mrr 1 -mediated MDR 1 upregulation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{major concern}} in {{sediment}} capping effectiveness is gas ebullition from organic matter biodegradation in sediments. Gases may open advective channels {{that can result}} in substantial pollution release. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the gas ebullition rate in sediments in preparation for construction of an <b>active</b> <b>capping</b> technology demonstration at the Collateral Channel site in the Chicago River. Sediment samples were collected from five sites along a transection of Collateral Channel from the combined sewer outfall at the Channel terminus. Biogenic gas production was measured in samples incubated at 5 ° to 35 ° C. Gas production followed a first order reaction trend and Arrhenius plots were obtained to determine the temperature dependence of the kinetic rate. These allowed us to predict gas ebullition for the annual temperature variation in the sediments. CO 2 /CH 4 ratios change with temperature, with lower ratios at lower temperatures suggesting dominance by acetoclastic methanogens. These data were used to select adequate <b>active</b> <b>capping</b> remedial alternatives for the Channel. We conclude that wide variations in gas production occur, necessitating gas capture/control during the elevated temperatures of summer. To achieve this, an innovative geo-mesh material with an overlying highly permeable layer will be employed...|$|R

Recent research has shown that the active amendment apatite has potential application for metals contaminated sediments. The focus {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of apatite in the sequestration of metal contaminants through the use of short-term laboratory column studies in conjunction with predictive, numerical modeling. A breakthrough column study was conducted using North Carolina apatite as the active amendment. Under saturated conditions, a spike solution containing elemental As, Cd, Co, Se, Pb, Zn, and a non-reactive tracer was injected into the column. A sand column was tested under similar conditions as a control. Effluent water samples were periodically collected from each column for chemical analysis. Relative to the non-reactive tracer, the breakthrough of each metal was substantially delayed by the apatite. Furthermore, breakthrough of each metal was substantially delayed by the apatite compared to the sand column. Finally, a simple 1 -D, numerical model was created to qualitatively predict the long-term performance of apatite based on the findings from the column study.

Oriented autonomous motion has been achieved throug dynamical feedback [6] or rectification in a periodically structured channel [7], opening applications such as targeted transport and pumping of passive particles.

An analog of peptide CAP 37 P 20 – 44 was synthesized in which the cysteine residues at positions 26 and 42 were replaced with serine residues (CAP 37 P 20 – 44 Ser). This resulted in a peptide that no longer exhibited bactericidal activity. The effect of different concentrations of the <b>active</b> <b>CAP</b> 37 peptide, CAP 37 P 20 – 44, and its inactive analog, CAP 37 P 20 – 44 Ser, on artificial lipid membranes composed of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) was studied using small-angle X-ray scattering and differential scanning calorimetry. The results indicated that CAP 37 P 20 – 44 perturbs the periodicity of the lamellar structure as shown by small angle X-ray diffraction, while the effect of the inactive peptide is not as strong. Differential scanning calorimetry further confirms that CAP 37 P 20 – 44 interacts with lipid membranes as indicated by increased width of the transition and decreased peak height. Moreover, it completely abolishes the pretransition temperature of the DPPC membranes. The effect of the inactive peptide, CAP 37 P 20 – 44 Ser on the thermotropic properties of DPPC was small.

40|$|New {{technologies}} are needed that neutralize contaminant toxicity and control physical transport mechanisms that mobilize sediment contaminants. The last 12 {{months of this}} comprehensive project investigated the use of combinations of sequestering agents to develop in situ active sediment caps that stabilize mixtures of contaminants and act {{as a barrier to}} mechanical disturbance under a broad range of environmental conditions. Efforts focused on the selection of effective sequestering agents for use in active caps, the composition of active caps, and the effects of <b>active</b> <b>cap</b> components on contaminant bioavailability and retention. Results from this project showed that phosphate amendments, some organoclays, and the biopolymer, chitosan, were very effective at removing metals from both fresh and salt water. These amendments also exhibited high retention (80 % or more) of most metals indicating reduced potential for remobilization to the water column. Experiments on metal speciation and retention in contaminated sediment showed that apatite and organoclay can immobilize a broad range of metals under both reduced and oxidized conditions. These studies were followed by sequential extractions to evaluate the bioavailability and retention of metals in treated sediments. Metal fractions recovered in early extraction steps {{are more likely to be}} bioavailable and were termed the Potentially Mobile Fraction (PMF). Less bioavailable fractions collected in later extraction steps were termed the Recalcitrant Factor (RF). Apatite and organoclay reduced the PMF and increased the RF for several elements, especially Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, and Cd. Empirically determined partitioning coefficients and modeling studies were used to assess the retention of organic contaminants on selected sequestering agents. Organoclays exhibited exceptionally high sorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as indicated by a comparison of K{sub d} values among 12 amendments. These results suggested that organoclays have high potential for controlling organic contaminants. Measured partitioning coefficients were used to model the time required for a contaminant to penetrate sediment caps composed of organoclay. The results showed that a thin layer of highly sorptive organoclay can lead to very long migration times, perhaps longer than the expected lifetime of the contaminant in the sediment environment. A one-dimensional numerical model was used to examine the diffusion of metals through several cap material based on measured and assumed material and transport properties. These studies showed that active caps composed of apatite or organoclay have the potential to delay contaminant breakthrough due to diffusion by hundreds of years or more compared with passive caps composed of sand. Advectively dominated column experiments are currently underway to define effective sorption related retardation factors in promising amendments for various hydrophobic organic compounds. Upon completion of these experiments, advection transient models will be used to estimate the time required for the breakthrough of various contaminants in caps composed of different experimental materials. Biopolymer products for inclusion in active caps were evaluated on the basis of resistance to biodegradation, sorption capacity for organic and inorganic contaminants, and potential for erosion control. More than 20 biopolymer products were evaluated resulting in the selection of chitosan/guar gum cross-linked with borax and xanthan/chitosan cross-linked with calcium chloride for inclusion in active caps to produce a barrier that resists mechanical disturbance. A process was developed for coating sand with cross-linked biopolymers to provide a means for delivery to the sediment surface. Properties of biopolymer coated sand such as carbon fraction (indicating biopolymer coverage), porosity, bulk density, and biodegradability have been evaluated, and experiments are currently underway to assess the resistance of biopolymer coated sand to erosion. Although the ability of <b>active</b> <b>cap</b> materials to remediate contaminants has been emphasized in this study, it is also important to ensure that these materials do not have deleterious effects on the environment. Therefore, promising amendments were evaluated for toxicity using 10 day sediment toxicity tests, the standardized Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP), and measurement of metal concentrations in aqueous extracts from the amendments. Metal concentrations were below TCLP limits, EPA ambient water quality criteria, and other ecological screening values These results showed that apatite, organoclay, and biopolymer coated sand do not release metals.

40|$|In residue {{analysis}} of antibiotics {{quantitative and qualitative}} aspects are involved in declaring a sample non-compliant. The quantitative aspect regards {{the determination of the}} amount of the compound present in the sample. Validation procedures are available to determine the uncertainty of this result, which is taken into account in the decision making process. The qualitative aspect regards the confirmation of the identity of the compound present. In this, selectivity is the main parameter which is defined as the ability of a method to discriminate the analyte being measured from other substances. A trend observed in {{residue analysis}} is towards more generic methods for the detection of a broad range of compounds in a single run. As a result, by definition, selectivity is compromised. Procedures to determine the uncertainty of the qualitative aspect are lacking and, as a result, whether or not a method is adequately selective is a matter of experts’ judgment. In this thesis a method is presented for grading selectivity of methods using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Based on the outcome it can be stated if selectivity is adequate and thus if a confirmatory result stands strong when challenged in a court case. If selectivity is found inadequate, additional measures can be taken like the selection of another product ion or the use of a third product ion to obtain adequate selectivity. Furthermore, two examples of analyses are presented in which selectivity plays an important role. First, the analysis of the banned antibiotic chloramphenicol (CAP). CAP contains two chiral centers and the nitro-group can either be para- or meta-substituted. Therefore, eight different isomers of CAP occur of which only RR-p-CAP is antimicrobially active. In the analysis of CAP, extreme selectivity is needed to distinguish the antimicrobially active compound from its inactive isomers. A method applying chiral liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry was developed to discriminate antimicrobially <b>active</b> <b>CAP</b> for its inactive isomers. Also the research for the possible natural occurrence of this drug is presented. It is shown that CAP can be produced in unamended soil by Streptomyces venezuelaein appreciable amounts and that crops can take up CAP from soils. Therefore, it is concluded that CAP can occur in crops and animal feed due to its natural production by soil bacteria. Second, the development of a multi-ß-lactam method is presented. In this method a derivatization is applied to be able to effectively detect off-label ceftiofur use. In this selectivity is intentionally compromised and no unequivocal confirmation can be carried out using this method. The developed method is applicable {{to a wide range of}} ß-lactam antibiotics including penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems and is the best method available today for effective monitoring of off-label ß-lactam usage in poultry breeding.  ...|$|E
40|$|Uridine {{diphosphate}} galacturonate 4 -epimerases 	Introduction 	 (UDPGLEs) are {{enzymes that}} convert UDP-glucuronate into UDP-galacturonate. Although {{the presence of}} UDPGLEs hasbeen reported in prokaryotic and eukary-otic organisms, the genes coding for these enzymes are completely unknown. The galacturonic acid-con-taining capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 1 is synthesized through the action of a specific UDPGLE. We have constructed a defined deletion mutant in the cap 1 J gene (one of the 15 cap 1 genes responsible for the synthesis of the type 1 cap-sule) that exhibited an unencapsulated phenotype. This mutant was unable to synthesize UDPGLE, sug-gesting that Cap 1 J was the type 1 -specific UDPGLE of S. pneumoniae. Escherichia coli cells harbouring the recombinant plasmid pRMM 38 (cap 1 J) overpro-duced a 40 kDa protein, characterized as Cap 1 J {{on the basis of}} the N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, and expressed high levels of enzymatically <b>active</b> <b>Cap</b> 1 J epimerase. Cap 1 J was partially purified, although puri-fication to electrophoretic homogeneity inactivated the enzyme irreversibly. The enzyme has the following characteristics: Km for UDP-glucuronate, 0. 24 mM; pH optimum, 7. 5; equilibrium constant (in the direction of UDP-galacturonate formation), 1. 3; and an approximate Mr of 80 000 for the active form. The Cap 1 J protein exhibited a fluorescence emission spectrum similar to that of NADH. Upon inactivation with p-hydroxymer-curibenzoate, the addition of NADþ and 2 -mercap-toethanol were sufficient to reactivate the enzyme. 	In an early work, Smith et al. (1957) first reported the isolation of UDP-galacturonic acid (UDP-GalA) from a type 1 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolate. Additional studies showed that cell-free extracts prepared from type 1 pneumococci contained an enzymatic activity capable of converting UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA) into UDP-GalA (Smith et al., 1958; 1960). UDP-GalA serves as a pre-cursor for the synthesis of type 1 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, as demonstrated by the finding that mutants deficient in UDP-glucuronate 4 -epimerase (UDP-GLE) (EC 5. 1. 3. 6) activity were unencapsulated (Austrian et al., 1959). Several independent reports have also detec-ted the presence of UDPGLE in the cyanobacterium Ana-baena flos-aquae (Ankel and Tischer, 1969; Gaunt et al., 1972; 1974; Maitra et al., 1974) and in different plants (Neufeld et al., 1958; Feingold et al., 1960; Neufeld, 1966; Dalessandro and Northcote, 1977). Unfortunately, none of these enzymes have been purified to sufficient homo-geneity, and attempts to clone the corresponding genes have not been documented, hampering a reliable charac-terization of this type of protein. We have reported recently the characterization of the gene cluster responsible for capsular polysaccharide bio-synthesis in type 1 strains of S. pneumoniae (Garcı´a et al., 1997; Mun˜oz et al., 1997) and identified the gene cap 1 K as that coding for the UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) dehydrogenase responsible for the synthesis of UDP-GlcA from UDP-Glc.

40|$|Candida albicans is an {{opportunistic}} fungal pathogen {{responsible for}} localized {{as well as}} disseminated infections. C. albicans is the most commonly isolated specie from blood cultures, accounting for over 60 % of all Candida isolates. The fungistatic drug fluconazole is {{the most widely used}} to treat fungal infections, thanks to its favorable bio-availability and to its low toxicity. The frequent and widespread use of this antifungal has led to the outcome of drug resistant clinical isolates. Various drug resistance mechanisms are known that render C. albicans resistant to fluconazole, among those, the overexpression of efflux pumps, which extrude the drug out of the fungal cell, and the overexpression of the fluconazole target, the Erg 11 enzyme. Overexpression of drug resistance genes is often associated to mutations in trans-acting transcription factors. The present study aimed at better understanding the role of known transcription factors involved in fluconazole resistance in C. albicans. In particular the role of TFs Mcm 1 and Ada 2 in resistance gene promoter activation has been evaluated. The transcription factors Mrr 1 and Cap 1 mediate MDR 1 upregulation in response to inducing stimuli, and gain-of-function mutations in Mrr 1 or Cap 1, which render the transcription factors hyperactive, result in constitutive MDR 1 overexpression. The essential MADS box transcription factor Mcm 1 also binds to the MDR 1 promoter, but its role in inducible or constitutive MDR 1 upregulation is unknown. Using a conditional mutant in which Mcm 1 can be depleted from the cells, the importance of Mcm 1 for MDR 1 expression was investigated. The results obtained indicated that Mcm 1 was dispensable for MDR 1 upregulation by H 2 O 2, but required for full MDR 1 induction by benomyl. A C-terminally truncated, hyperactive Cap 1 could upregulate MDR 1 expression both in the presence and absence of Mcm 1. In contrast, a hyperactive Mrr 1 containing a gain-of-function mutation depended on Mcm 1 to cause MDR 1 overexpression. These results demonstrate a differential requirement of the co-regulator Mcm 1 for Cap 1 - and Mrr 1 -mediated MDR 1 upregulation. When activated by oxidative stress or a gain-of-function mutation, Cap 1 could induce MDR 1 expression independently of Mcm 1, whereas Mrr 1 required either Mcm 1 or an <b>active</b> <b>Cap</b> 1 to cause overexpression of the MDR 1 efflux pump. Other transcription factors that mediate drug resistance gene regulation are Tac 1, which regulates CDR 1 and CDR 2 expression, and Upc 2, regulating ERG 11 gene expression. Also in this case, gain-of-function mutations, which render these transcription factors hyperactive, result in constitutive overexpression of the target genes. Ada 2 is part of the SAGA/ADA complex and {{has been shown to be}} recruited to 200 promoters upstream of genes involved in different stress-response functions and metabolic processes. As for Mcm 1, the importance of Ada 2 for MDR 1 expression was investigated, as well as for CDR 2 and ERG 11 expression. Ada 2 was found to be dispensable for MDR 1 upregulation by H 2 O 2, but required for MDR 1 activation by hyperactive Cap 1. When activated by benomyl or a gain-of-function mutation, Mrr 1 induced MDR 1 expression even better in the absence of Ada 2. CDR 2 expression by hyperactive Tac 1 was facilitated in the presence of Ada 2 and an opposite behaviour was observed when CDR 2 expression was stimulated by the presence of fluphenazine in the medium. Finally, further experiments are required to better understand the role of Ada 2 in the expression of ERG 11.

40|$|A double {{immunolabelling}} {{technique was}} developed to study microscopically the interactions between CD 4, CD 45 and the T cell receptor {{on the surface of}} rat T cells induced by the phenomenon of co-capping. It was found that both CD 4 and CD 45 passively co-cap with the actively capped T cell receptor, that the T cell receptor and CD 45 passively co-cap with CD 4, but that neither CD 4 nor the T cell receptor co-cap with CD 45. Co-crosslinking and <b>active</b> <b>capping</b> of CD 45 with either the T cell receptor or CD 4 prevented CD 4 or the T cell receptor respectively, from passively co-capping. These experiments were extended to study the effects of particular antibody crosslinking conditions on T cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation. A correlation was found to exist between receptor distribution and the effects of particular antibody combinations on proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation. The significance of this with respect to T cell activation is discussed. Finally, an observation is reported concerning the failure of some cell lines to cap antibody-crosslinked surface molecules. Preliminary investgations into {{the nature and extent of}} the phenomenon are described. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} evaluated organoclays, zeolites, phosphates, and a biopolymer as sequestering {{agents for}} inorganic and organic contaminants. Batch experiments {{were conducted to}} identify amendments and mixtures of amendments for metal and organic contaminants removal and retention. Contaminant removal was evaluated by calculating partitioning coefficients. Metal retention was evaluated by desorption studies in which residue from the removal studies was extracted with 1 M MgCl{sub 2 } solution. The results indicated that phosphate amendments, some organoclays, and the biopolymer, chitosan, were very effective sequestering agents for metals in fresh and salt water. Organoclays were very effective sorbents for phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo(a) pyrene. Partitioning coefficients for the organoclays were 3000 - 3500 ml g{sup - 1 } for benzo(a) pyrene, 400 - 450 ml g{sup - 1 } for pyrene, and 50 - 70 ml g{sup - 1 } for phenanthrene. Remediation of sites {{with a mixture of}} contaminants is more difficult than sites with a single contaminant because metals and organic contaminants have different fate and transport mechanisms in sediment and water. Mixtures of amendments (e. g., organoclay and rock phosphate) have high potential for remediating both organic and inorganic contaminants under a broad range of environmental conditions, and have promise as components in <b>active</b> <b>caps</b> for sediment remediation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although {{remediation}} scenarios typically {{focus on}} one class of pollutants such as metals or hydrophobic organics, most contaminated sediments have mixtures of both. We assayed the performance of several different kinds of <b>active</b> <b>capping</b> materials for a large range of sediment contaminants to provide information on their applicability to cap design using a Monte Carlo approach. Five caps were chosen: 25 cm of sand, 2 cm of organoclay, 10 cm of shredded tires, 2 cm of coke, and 2 cm of granular activated carbon (GAC). Their performance {{in the presence of}} eight metals, twelve hydrophobic organic compounds and two organo-metals were modeled under both static (diffusion only) and advection flow conditions created by different hydraulic gradients across the sediment water interface. Not surprisingly, it takes a much shorter time for breakthrough of contaminants with advection under all scenarios. This indicates that more strongly binding cap materials (such as GAC) or low permeability barriers (like clay) are required in sites with advection. Our simulations demonstrate that organoclays perform well under both static and advection flow conditions. In addition, assumptions of diffusion only may not necessarily be applicable throughout the useful life of a cap. For example, a sand layer (the so-called “particle-broadcasting ” scenario), which may be suitable under diffusion only, could be rendered totally ineffective with advection. In general, caps that can either strongly bind a pollutant or decrease the hydraulic gradient without a build up of biogenic gas perform best...|$|R
