40|$|Using {{measurements}} from <b>the</b> Wind spacecraft <b>at</b> 1 [*]AU, <b>the</b> heating of protons in <b>the</b> {{solar wind}} <b>at</b> locations of intense velocity shear is examined. <b>The</b> 4321 <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> intense shear in fast coronal hole origin plasma are analyzed. The proton temperature, the proton specific entropy, and the proton number density <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{locations of the}} shears are {{compared with the same}} quantities in the plasmas adjacent to the shears. A very slight but statistically significant enhancement of the proton temperature is seen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shears, but it is accompanied by a larger enhancement of the proton number density <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shears. Consequently, there is no enhancement of the proton specific entropy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shear <b>sites,</b> indicating no production of entropy; hence, no evidence for plasma heating is found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> velocity shears. Since the shearing velocities have appreciable Mach numbers, the authors suggest that there can be a slight adiabatic compression of <b>the</b> plasma <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shear zones. Key Points No proton heating is observed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> intense velocity shear Temperature‐density signatures are consistent with adiabatic compressions The compressions could be associated with the large Mach numbers of the shear...|$|R

30|$|A similar {{accumulation}} {{pattern was}} observed for infected mice injected with [18 F]FDG- 6 -P (Figure  5 a). However, differences in accumulation {{between the two}} radiopharmaceuticals were visualised <b>at</b> <b>the</b> catheter <b>site</b> <b>of</b> uninfected mice. Unlike [18 F]FDG, [18 F]FDG- 6 -P did not accumulate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> sterile inflammation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ends of the catheter, suggesting that [18 F]FDG- 6 -P was not accumulating within the inflammatory cells.|$|R
40|$|To study {{chromatin}} structure <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> DNA {{replicated in}} permeable cells, deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) sensitivity of newly replicated DNA in permeable mouse sarcoma cells was {{compared with that}} of newly replicated DNA in intact cells. About 35 % of the DNA replicated in permeable cells was hypersensitive to DNase I, and the remaining DNA showed the same DNase I sensitivity as that of parental chromatin DNA. The sensitivity of DNA replicated in permeable cells was higher than that of DNA newly replicated in intact cells, and was close to that of DNA replicated in the presence of cycloheximide. The sensitivity of DNA pulse-labeled with [3 H]deoxythymidine triphosphate by replication in permeable cells was reduced significantly by chasing with cold deoxythymidine triphosphate. The present results suggest that chromatin structure <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> DNA replicated in permeable cells is similar to that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> DNA replicated in living cells in the absence of protein synthesis, and that some structural change (possibly toward the maturation) of newly replicated chromatin occurs after the DNA replication in permeable cells. </p...|$|R
