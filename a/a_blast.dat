5|$|Since the 17th {{century the}} first step in European steel {{production}} has been the smelting of iron ore into pig iron in <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> furnace. Originally employing charcoal, modern methods use coke, which has proven more economical.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of iron or steel {{is a process}} consisting of two main stages. In the first stage pig iron is produced in <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> furnace. Alternatively, it may be directly reduced. In the second stage, pig iron is converted to wrought iron, steel, or cast iron.|$|E
5|$|The {{products}} of the above-mentioned processes are transformed into the cobalt oxide (Co3O4). This oxide is reduced to the metal by the aluminothermic reaction or reduction with carbon in <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> furnace.|$|E

40|$|With {{the recent}} threats of terrorism, {{many people have}} {{expressed}} concern about the likelihood and effects of <b>a</b> nuclear <b>blast.</b> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed this fact sheet to describe what happens when <b>a</b> nuclear <b>blast</b> occurs, the possible health effects, {{and what you can do}} to protect yourself in this type of emergency.

50|$|When {{charges are}} used to dig foxholes, <b>an</b> improvised <b>blasting</b> mat made from whole tires tied {{together}} with rope to reduce noise and fly rock, is recommended in the A Soldiers Handbook (United States). A tarp may {{also be used as}} <b>a</b> <b>blasting</b> blanket.|$|R
5|$|A primary {{pneumothorax}} is {{one that}} occurs without an apparent cause {{and in the absence}} of significant lung disease, while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing lung disease. Smoking increases the risk as do lung diseases including COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis. A pneumothorax can also be caused by physical trauma to the chest (including <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> injury), or as a complication of a healthcare intervention; in which case it is called a traumatic pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|Bockscar {{was used}} in 13 {{training}} and practice missions from Tinian, and three combat missions in which it dropped pumpkin bombs on industrial targets in Japan. On 9 August 1945, Bockscar, piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron's commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, dropped a Fat Man nuclear bomb with <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT over the city of Nagasaki. About 44% {{of the city was}} destroyed; 35,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.|$|E
5|$|Bombard weaponry: The oldest {{representation}} of a bombard {{can be found in}} the Chinese town of Ta-tsu. In 1985, the Canadian historian Robin Yates visited the Buddhist cave temples when he saw a sculpture on the wall depicting a demon holding a hand-held bombard. The muzzle seems to have <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> and flames coming from it which some believe is proof of some type of super gun. Yates examined the cave and believed the drawings dated back to the late 12th century.|$|E

5|$|For the {{production}} of ferromanganese, the manganese ore is mixed with iron ore and carbon, and then reduced either in <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> furnace or in an electric arc furnace. The resulting ferromanganese has a manganese content of 30 to 80%. Pure manganese used for {{the production}} of iron-free alloys is produced by leaching manganese ore with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process.|$|E

It allows the player to break combinations and super {{moves in the}} middle of the opponent's offensive. Also, if the blast hit the adversary, the tension gauge is filled to its maximum capacity immediately.|$|E

As a result, a crowded trolley car, and a brewery truck fell into the excavation, accounting for most of the injuries.|$|E
5|$|Stone wool or {{rock wool}} is a spun mineral fibre {{used as an}} {{insulation}} product and in hydroponics. It is manufactured in <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> furnace fed with diabase rock which contains very low levels of metal oxides. The resultant slag is drawn off and spun to form the rock wool product. Very small amounts of metals are also produced which are an unwanted by-product and run to waste.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} where the disaster occurred {{was used by}} the Qinghe Special Steel Corporation as a steel processing plant. The ladle which failed carried molten steel from <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> furnace to other processes, and had a diameter of two metres and a capacity of 30 tons (25 tonnes) of liquid steel. It ran on a rail at a height of three metres above the factory floor.|$|E

5|$|The main {{sources of}} bromine are in the United States and Israel. The element is liberated by halogen exchange, using {{chlorine}} gas to oxidise Br− to Br2. This is then removed with <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> of steam or air, and is then condensed and purified. Today, bromine is transported in large-capacity metal drums or lead-lined tanks that can hold hundreds of kilograms or even tonnes of bromine. The bromine industry is about one-hundredth {{the size of the}} chlorine industry. Laboratory production is unnecessary because bromine is commercially available and has a long shelf life.|$|E
5|$|Travis assumed {{command of}} the Alamo {{garrison}} on February 11, when Neill was granted a furlough. On February 23, Santa Anna arrived in Béxar {{at the head of}} approximately 1500 Mexican troops. The 150 Texian soldiers were unprepared for this development. As they rushed to the Alamo, Texians quickly herded cattle into the complex and scrounged for food in nearby houses. The Mexican army initiated a siege of the Alamo and raised a blood-red flag signalling no quarter. Travis responded with <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> from the Alamo's largest cannon.|$|E
5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor is blown off his feet by <b>a</b> <b>blast</b> of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E
