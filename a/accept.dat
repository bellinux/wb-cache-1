50|$|An {{alternating}} Turing {{machine is}} a non-deterministic Turing machine whose states {{are divided into}} two sets: existential states and universal states. An existential state is <b>accepting</b> if some transition leads to an <b>accepting</b> state; a universal state is <b>accepting</b> if every transition leads to an <b>accepting</b> state. (Thus a universal state with no transitions <b>accepts</b> unconditionally; an existential state with no transitions rejects unconditionally).

Neither Croatia nor the RSK liked the plan. Croatia was concerned that the RSK might <b>accept</b> it, but Tuđman realised that Milošević, who would ultimately make the decision for the RSK, would not <b>accept</b> the plan for fear that it would set a precedent for a political settlement in Kosovoallowing Croatia to <b>accept</b> the plan with little possibility {{for it to be}} implemented.

5|$|Qiyas or analogical {{reason is}} the fourth source of the sharia for the {{majority}} of Sunni jurisprudence. It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision.

Analogical reason in Islam is the process of legal deduction according to which the jurist, confronted with an unprecedented case, bases his or her argument on the logic used in the Qur'an and Sunnah. Legally sound analogy must not be based on arbitrary judgment, but rather be firmly rooted in the primary sources.|$|E
