5|$|An atom can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The electric charge causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius by which the trajectory of <b>a</b> <b>moving</b> ion is turned by the magnetic field {{is determined by the}} mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.|$|E

After Cross saves Wesley from falling, Wesley fatally shoots him. Before dying, Cross reveals that he is Wesley's real father. Fox confirms this, and explains that Wesley was recruited {{because he was the}} only person Cross would not kill. Fox points her gun at Wesley, but he shoots the window below,falling into the river.|$|E
5|$|Based on this star's {{kinematic}} properties, {{it appears}} {{to belong to a}} stellar association called the Castor Moving Group. However, Vega may be much older than this group, so the membership remains uncertain. This group contains about 16 stars, including Alpha Librae, Alpha Cephei, Castor, Fomalhaut and Vega. All members of the group are moving in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in <b>a</b> <b>moving</b> group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound.

At the end of the story, an anonymous man is talking to his wife about two strangers he picked up on a trip to Tennessee, recounting that the woman had a child and the man was not the father. This was Lena and Byron, who were conducting a half-hearted search for Brown, and they are eventually dropped off in Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's {{drooping}} nose, {{developed by}} Marshall's of Cambridge at Cambridge Airport, enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due {{to the high}} angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose was accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>moving</b> visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise {{in front of the}} cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.|$|E
