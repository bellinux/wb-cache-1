50|$|Other LPAM {{operations}} {{are known as}} Travelers' Information Stations (TIS), sometimes also called <b>highway</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>radio</b> (HAR). Authorized under FCC Part 90.242, these are stations licensed to local transportation departments or other governmental or quasi-governmental agencies to provide bulletins to motorists regarding traffic conditions. These are often near highways and airports, and occasionally other tourism attractions such as national parks. Some are used by chemical and nuclear facilities for emergency evacuation information systems, others by public safety entities for mobile operations. They are normally authorized for 10 watts or less, although some higher authorizations exist, primarily in locations where emergency evacuation may become necessary. The 60 watt TIS stations on 1640 and 1680 kHz at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport are {{the most powerful of}} the full-time TIS stations.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} {{significant}} investment in ITS technologies that provide traveler information to both en-route and pre-trip travelers. These technologies include Variable Message Signs (VMS), <b>Highway</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Radio</b> (HAR) and integrated Incident Management Systems to track and monitor roadway impediments along Connecticut 2 ̆ 7 s freeways. Although these technologies provide travel information to motorists, there is no definitive evidence as to whether en-route travelers actually use the information and alter their travel patterns. ^ Previous research employed stated-preference surveys that rely on motorists 2 ̆ 7 written or spoken responses {{to a series of}} questions involving travel information and hypothetical roadway scenarios. Earlier literature suggests that under real world travel conditions, there is a discrepancy between motorists 2 ̆ 7 actual behavior and their stated-preference responses. Few studies have been performed using real-time traffic data on roadways equipped with ITS traveler information technologies in an effort to capture traveler behavior. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to examine travel behavior on freeways equipped with ITS technologies, such as VMS and HAR, in Connecticut. Using collected real-time traffic count data from the diversionary roadways, the study will employ statistical methods to analyze and determine whether traveler information technologies impact normal travel flow during a traffic incident. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to identify, through a {{literature}} review, the potential safety benefits of implementing various ITS technologies through Virginia’s Smart Travel Program. This study was requested by the ITS Section of the Virginia Department of Transportation to document what is believed to be an underestimated benefit of ITS: safety. Several Advanced Traffic Management Systems technologies improve safety, primarily through reducing congestion. In general, this reduces crash risk, particularly for multivehicle crashes. Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) provide information to the public by such means as the broadcast media, cable television, <b>highway</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>radio,</b> and the Internet. Although no studies document an impact, a simulation study showed that such a system has the potential to reduce crash risk. Commercial Vehicle Operations (CVO) applications have the potential to reduce the risk of fatalities and serious injuries. CVO are generally geared to improving the efficiency of safety inspections and reducing inconvenience to motor carriers that are not in violation. Because of greater efficiency, more hazardous vehicles and drivers can be removed from service. Much of the work on Advanced Vehicle Control and Safety Systems is in the developmental stages. Although vehicle-based warning systems would provide the driver with some warning once the vehicle enters a hazardous situation, road-based o...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development and}} implementation of FASTCARS (Freeway and Arterial Street Traffic Conflict Arousal and Resolution Simulator), an interactive microcomputer-based animated simulator designed for in-laboratory experimentation and data collection to assist in the estimation and calibration of predictive models of driver behavior under the influence or real-time information. Limited real-world implementation of Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) technologies has made it difficult to analyze the potential impact on driver behavior. It is contended here that in-laboratory experimentation with interactive animated route choice simulators can substitute for the lack of real-work applications and provide a useful approach to data collection and driver behavior analysis. The advantages of using FASTCARS over other data collection methods to study driver behavior are realized through the program's flexibility and completeness. FASTCARS combines a real-time interactive driving simulation program using a graphics-type interface with visual and audio effects to imitate enroute travel decision making. The simulation encompasses the entire driving process from pre-trip planning through arrival at the destination. Players are required to make a broad range of choices including goal specification, route and lane changes, and whether to use available information technologies. To model the impacts of real-time traffic condition information on driving behavior, FASTCARS emulates three types of ATIS: Variable Message Signs, In-vehicle Navigation Systems, and <b>Highway</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Radio...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has considerably changed {{the field of}} transportation modeling during the past ten years. By Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) we refer to transportation systems which apply emerging information technologies to alleviate congestion problems (see, for example, Transportation Research Board 1999). They combine advanced surveillance systems collecting real-time traffic data, Advanced Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) and Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) {{in order to achieve}} that objective. The complexity of these systems requires the development of sophisticated tools for their optimal explo itation. Among the many ITS applications, providing real-time travel information is a particularly important one. It consists in using available data from the surveillance system in order to generate information that will be disseminated by the ATIS (variable message signs, <b>highway</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>radio</b> on standard broadcast bands, on-board GPS-based computers, etc.) The messages may contain complete or partial route recommendations, qualitative or quantitative information about traffic conditions over the network. We are interested here in generating consistent anticipatory route guidance (CARG). Anticipatory guidance accounts for the probable evolution of traffic conditions over time and throughout the network. By consistent, we mean that the anticipated traffic conditions used to generate the guidance must be similar to the traffic conditions that the travelers are going to experience on the network. The problem is non trivial because, contrarily to weather forecast where the real system under consideration is not affected by information provision, the very fact of providing travel information may modify the [...] ...|$|R
