Multitemporal Landsat Multispectral Scanner data were processed to derive snow accumulation and ablation patterns throughout a snow season.

Transition matrices were used to assess the change in the state of snow cover conditions, whereas multiple regression analyses were used to examine the position and character of snow avalanche paths. The analyses were framed and implemented within a geographic information system (GIS) approach. Results indicate a snowmelt pattern progressing from zonal to azonal; influence of local site and situation factors in snow accumulation and ablation patterns; and the importance of topography, geologic structure, and lithology in defining the starting elevation and source area of snow avalanche paths.

40|$|<b>Alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotones</b> (ATE) are the {{transition}} zones between contiguous subalpine forest and open alpine tundra. Because of their transitional natures formed by different ecosystems in high mountain areas, {{there are a}} variety of acute interactions between different species, between vegetations and environmental factors, and between ecological pattern and process. These interactions, or feedbacks, are often nonlinear in nature and make <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotones</b> sensitive to environmental change, especially climate change. Feedbacks or nonlinear interactions between pattern and process create a variety of distinctive yet sometime surprising <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> patterns. These nonlinear interactions between pattern and process and their resultant various patterns are defined as spatial complexity. In this study, the research framework of complexity theory was adopted. Dynamical simulations of <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone</b> is used as basic research method, and local nonlinear interactions, or more specifically, positive feedbacks are considered the key mechanism driving <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> dynamics. A cellular simulation was created with tree/no-tree states that change as a function of probabilities of tree establishment and mortality which are functions of the neighborhood and an underlying gradient; the former changes in space and time endogenously; the latter can change in space and time exogenously. Three research projects were conducted for this dissertation that explore the endogenous and exogenous aspects of <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> dynamics. First, the endogenous dynamics of <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotones</b> was examined, which indicates that local positive feedbacks originated from interactions between trees can create fractal spatial dynamics in space and time.

Third, the impacts of climate change that imposes an exogenous temporal structure on <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> dynamics was examined, which suggests that the self-organization nature of <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> dynamics will not be significantly affected by external climate change and the use of <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotones</b> as potential indicator of climate change is called into question.

40|$|Only a {{few studies}} have {{addressed}} the soil and foliar carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) stoichiometry in <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotones.</b> Moreover, information on the soil nutrient availability (primarily N, P) in such ecosystems is rare. To fill these gaps, we performed a multiple data sampling in a near-natural <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone</b> in Rolwaling Himal, Nepal. Our results show strongly varying soil C:N:P ratios and nutrient availability with soil depth. Caused by high monsoon precipitation and coarse-grained soils with low water-holding capacities, a vertical transport of nutrients and potentially mineralizable soil organic matter (SOM) in soils occurs, which is a general problem in the study area impeding growing conditions for trees. Soil N and P availability, and soil C:P and N:P ratios decrease significantly as elevation increases, especially at the transition from krummholz (dominated by Rhododendron campanulatum) to the alpine tundra (dwarf scrub heath). Soil C:N ratios increase significantly with elevation, most notably from the subalpine forest to krummholz and the alpine tundra. These altitudinal trends indicate increasing nutrient (N, P) shortage especially in the alpine tundra. Low N and P availability in alpine tundra soils are likely caused by a lower litter input from dwarf shrub vegetation, and a decline in litter mineralization in this altitudinal zone resulting in small accumulation of SOM. Nutrient availability in the entire study area is generally limited by low soil pH (from 2. 5 to 4). In total six investigated tree species show diverse relationships between foliar and soil stoichiometric ratios, and soil nutrient availability. Significantly increasing foliar C:N and C:P ratios with elevation due to significantly decreasing foliar N and P concentrations suggest a limitation in N and P. Foliar N:P ratios indicate N rather than P limitation. Contrary to previous studies from different <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotones,</b> we do not consider the Rolwaling <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone</b> as an area of nutrient accumulation.

Here, we investigated the population dynamics of Larix potainii on the south- and north-facing slopes in the <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone</b> in the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, China, including treeline position, population density, and tree recruitment. Results showed that on both south- and north-facing slopes, the treeline did not show a significant advancement in the past four decades. The population was dominated by young individuals, which tend to be established in the lower areas. Larix, here, tends to be clustered, especially in the upper areas. However, population density increased dramatically only on north-facing slopes. Larix here suffer from the stressful environment, but the warmer winter due to climate warming could facilitate the vertical growth of seedlings and saplings. Aggregated spatial patterns also provide a positive feedback in ameliorating the harsh environment.

40|$|An ecotone is {{a zone of}} {{vegetation}} transition between two communities, often resulting from a natural or anthropogenic environmental gradient. In remotely sensed imagery, an ecotone may appear as an edge, a boundary of mixed pixels or a zone of continuous variation, depending on the spatial scale of the vegetation communities and their transition zone {{in relation to the}} spatial resolution of the imagery. Often in image classification, an ecotone is either ignored if it falls within a width of one or two pixels, or part of it may be mapped as a separate vegetation community if it covers an area of several pixel widths. A soft classification method, such as probability mapping, is inherently appealing for mapping vegetation transition. Ideally, the probability of membership each pixel has to each vegetation class corresponds with the proportional composition {{of vegetation}} classes per pixel. In this paper we investigate the use of class probability mapping to produce a softened classification of an <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone</b> in Austria using a SPOT 5 HRG image. Here the transition with altitude is from dense subalpine forest to treeless alpine meadow and herbaceous vegetation. The posterior probabilities from a Maximum Likelihood algorithm are shown to reflect the land-cover composition of mixed pixels in the ecotone. The relationships between the posterior probability of class membership for the two end-member classes of ‘scrub and forest’ and ‘non-forest vegetation’ and the percentage ground cover of these vegetation classes (enumerated in 15 quadrats from 1 : 1500 aerial photographs) were highly significant: r 2 = 0. 83 and r 2 = 0. 85 respectively (p < 0. 001, n = 15). We identify thresholds (alpha-cuts) in the posterior probabilities of class membership of ‘scrub and forest’ and ‘non-forest vegetation’ to map the <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone</b> as a transition zone of five intermediate vegetation classes between the end-member communities. In addition, we investigate the representation of the ecotone as a ratio between the posterior probabilities of ‘scrub and forest’ and ‘non-forest vegetation’.

40|$|Height-diameter {{relationship}} {{is one of}} the most important stature characteristics of trees. It will change with climatic conditions because height and diameter growth displays different sensitivities to climatic factors such as temperature. Detecting and understanding changes in the stature of trees growing along altitudinal gradients up to their upper limits can help us to better understand the adaptation strategy of trees under global warming conditions. On Changbai Mountain in northeastern China, height-diameter datasets were collected for 2723 Erman’s birch (Betula ermanii Cham.) in the <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone</b> in 2006 and 2013, and for 888 Erman’s birch, spruce (Picea jezoensis Siebold & Zucc.

These datasets were utilized to explore both changes in the stature of birch at the <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> over time and variations in tree stature of different tree species across altitudes at a given time point (2006). Results showed that birch saplings ( 140 cm became more tapered in the <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone.</b> The stature of birch along the altitudinal gradient became more tapered from 1700 to 1900 m above see level (a. s. l.) and then became more stunted from 1900 to 2050 m a. s. l., with 1900 m a. s. l. being the altitudinal inflection point in this pattern. The treeline birch, due to its great temperature magnitude of distribution, displayed higher stature-plasticity in terms of its height-diameter ratio than the lower elevation species studied. The stature of birch is strongly modulated by altitude-related temperature but also co-influenced by other environmental factors such as soil depth and available water, wind speed, and duration and depth of winter snow cover. The high stature-plasticity of birch makes it fare better than other species to resist and adapt to, as well as to survive and develop in the harsh alpine environment...|$|R

Feedback creates nonlinear relations in the response of vegetation to climate and so decouples the response to climate at least in rate. Then protected sites can become fully occupied during periods of rapid response driven by feedback but less available immediately thereafter even if the climate continues to ameliorate.

Temperature fluctuations were much larger and the average temperature was higher in alpine vegetation than in forest. Most treelines were abrupt, with surprisingly similar patterns across a wide geographical range.

We mapped and measured the size and age of Smith fir trees growing in two treelines located in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. We used spatial point-pattern and codispersion analyses to describe the spatial association and covariation among seedlings, juveniles, and adults grouped in 30 -yr age classes from the 1860 s to the present. Effects of competition on tree height and regeneration were inferred from bivariate mark-correlations. Since the 1950 s, a rapid densification occurred at both sites in response to climatic warming. Competition between adults and juveniles or seedlings at small scales intensified as density increased. Encroachment negatively affected height growth and further reduced recruitment around mature trees. We infer that tree recruitment at the studied treelines was more cold-limited prior to 1950 and shifted to a less temperature-constrained regime in response to climatic warming.

Differentiation between two different types of thermally-driven upslope winds, land cover-induced flow and anabatic flow, was done through an investigation of surface pressure and sensible heat flux at sites in the subalpine forest and alpine tundra. It was found that anabatic forces, not transitions in land cover from forest to tundra, were responsible for the generation of upslope winds on Niwot Ridge. Analyses on the composition of airmasses showed that upslope winds were generally cooler, more humid, and weaker in strength than downslope, westerly winds.

[...] University of Washington, 2015 - 12 Although {{the direct}} {{effects of climate}} change have been studied though {{observational}} and experimental methods in <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotones</b> (ATEs), indirect effects due to shifts in disturbance regimes have received less attention, despite evidence that the frequency and extent of large disturbances are increasing in many other ecosystems. At a regional scale, I analyzed wildfires occurring over a 29 -year period (1984 - 2012) in ATEs in eight mountainous ecoregions of the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rocky Mountains. I focused on two components of the ATE: (1) subalpine parkland, which extends from closed subalpine forest through a fine-scale mosaic of forests and non-forest, and (2) alpine vegetation, which includes meadow, shrubland, and alpine tundra. I expected that subalpine parkland and alpine vegetation would burn less, proportionally, than the entire ecoregion. In four of eight ecoregions—three in Rocky Mountains and one in the Cascades—the proportion of subalpine parkland burned was comparable or greater than the proportion of the entire ecoregion that burned. In alpine ecosystems little of the area (500 plots within four <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotones</b> sites in the Cascade Range and Northern Rocky Mountains, which had burned 18 - 27 years prior. I assessed the likelihood of different pre-fire canopy-cover structural classes—closed forest (> 40 % tree cover), open forest (10 %- 40 %), parkland (< 10 %), and unforested areas (alpine, meadow, and Krummholz) —to burn and to change to a different structural class after fire. I also evaluated changes in forest structure—specifically the abundance of live trees within five diameter at breast height (DBH) classes—using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to visualize differences and Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) to test statistically for differences from pre-fire to post-fire, and between unburned and three higher-severity class. Non-forested areas were less likely to burn and fire increased the proportion of non-forested area. The effects of the fire on forest structure were mixed: previously forested stands had a greater probability of retaining forest cover than they had of becoming non-forested. Greater fire severity decreased the abundance of larger, relative to smaller, overstory trees; the latter suffered greater mortality. Of the four common high-elevation tree species observed in burned plots, Abies lasiocarpa had the highest rates of mortality (60 %), Larix lyallii had the lowest rate (11 %), with intermediate levels in Pinus albicaulis (52 %) and Picea engelmannii (37 %). Strong, significant correlations between the overall annual area burned across all vegetation types, and the area burned in subalpine parkland and alpine vegetation (ρ = 0. 89 and ρ = 0. 88, respectively) indicate that fire may become more prevalent in both subalpine parkland and alpine vegetation if the overall area burned increases due to climate change. Within burned ATEs, fire effects are moderate, and highly heterogeneous. The combined effect of climate change and fire may cause ATEs to expand upward and trees to infill previously snow-dominated sites, while simultaneously increasing fine- and course-scale heterogeneity within the ecotone, due to fire-cause mortality...|$|R
40|$|Alpine {{areas by}} {{definition}} have summer temperatures too cool to support trees. Concerns {{have been raised}} that trees may invade these distinctive habitats where global climate change results {{in an increase in}} summer temperatures beyond the threshold limiting tree growth. In 2016, we investigated changes in the treeline and vegetation immediately above it by resampling quadrats and rephotographing from the set points established in the <b>Alpine</b> <b>Treeline</b> <b>Ecotone</b> Monitoring Program on Mount Rufus, Tasmania, in 2006. Within the study area, the only species with the potential to reach a tree height > 3 m is Eucalyptus coccifera Hook. f. The height, density, basal diameter and diameter at breast height were recorded for all E. coccifera within the study area, together with an estimate of percentage cover of each vascular plant species. No change was found in the location of the treeline over the 10 -year period, although E. coccifera height and density above the treeline did increase. The vegetation on the north-facing slope shifted to a composition more closely related to the forest below the treeline, while on the south-facing slope forest species reduced in abundance and the vegetation became more dominated by alpine species. Historical aerial photographs suggest {{that there has been a}} minor and inconsistent establishment of E. coccifera plants at higher altitudes since 1953. The area was burned by bushfire in 1965, making it difficult to separate the effects of putative climate change and recovery after the fire event on vegetation changes, although data from Lake St Clair suggest a local constancy of mean growing season temperatures and rainfall...|$|R
40|$|Although {{climate warming}} is {{generally}} expected to facilitate upward advance of forests, conifer seedling regeneration and survival may be hindered by low substrate moisture, high radiation, and both {{low and high}} snow accumulation. To better understand substrate-related factors promoting regeneration in the <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone,</b> this study compared 2 substrates supporting conifer seedlings: rotten downed wood and adjacent soil. Study locations, each with 3 levels of incoming radiation, were randomly selected at forest line–alpine meadow borders in Pacific Northwest wilderness areas extending along an east–west precipitation gradient. Associations among substrate type, seedling density, radiation, site moisture, site temperature, plant water potential, and plant stomatal conductance were assessed. Wood microsites, flush with the ground and supporting Abies spp conifer seedlings, extended up to 20 m into alpine meadows from the forest line. Although wood microsites thawed later {{in the spring and}} froze earlier in the fall, they had warmer summer temperatures, greater volumetric water content, and more growing degree hours, and seedlings growing on wood had higher water potentials than seedlings growing on adjacent soil. At drier eastern sites, there was a positive relationship between seedling density and volumetric water content. Further, there was a positive relationship between seedling stomatal conductance and volumetric water content. Our study indicates that in the Pacific Northwest. and likely elsewhere, seedlings benefit from wood microsites, which provide greater water content. Given predictions of increased summer drought in some locations globally, wood microsites at forest line–alpine meadows and forest line–grasslands borders may become increasingly important for successful conifer regeneration...|$|R
40|$|The <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone</b> is an {{important}} component of mountain ecosystems of the Nepal Himalayas; it plays a vital role in the livelihood of indigenous people and provides ecosystem services. However, the region faces a problem of paucity of data on treeline characteristics at the regional, landscape, and local scales. Therefore, I applied remote sensing and geographic information science approaches to investigate the <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone</b> at the regional (entire Nepal) and landscape (Barun and Manang Valleys) scales. Treeline elevation ranges from 3300 ? 4300 m. Abies spectabilis, Betula utilis, and Pinus wallichiana are the main treeline-forming species in the Nepal Himalayas. There is an east to west treeline elevation gradient at the regional scale. No slope exposure is observed at the regional scale; however, at the landscape scale, slope exposure is present only in a disturbed area. From the landscape scale study, I found that topography and human disturbance are the main treeline-controlling factors in Barun and Manang, respectively. Diverse treeline-forming species and treeline nature observed in the landscape and regional scale study suggested more investigation was needed at the local scale. Therefore, I established two transects of 20 m width and 120 m length (100 m above and 20 m below the forestline) in the Betula utilis sub-alpine forest of the Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve in western Nepal to understand the local scale treeline dynamics. Poor regeneration was observed above the forestline in both transects compared to below the forestline. Low regeneration at the <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone</b> suggested site-specific biotic and abiotic controlling factors. Seedling and sapling establishment above the forestline is limited by a lack of moisture, an absence of suitable microsites, and the presence of herbivores. I found the treeline stable at the local scale. I used the Maxent species distribution modeling approach to predict the likelihood of treeline advance in the Nepal Himalayas by modeling the habitat suitability of three dominant treeline species?A. spectabilis, B. utilis, and P. wallichiana?under present and alternative future climates. Temperature-related climatic variables and elevation explained the greatest amount of variance in the distribution of the study species. Under future climate models, I found a regional increase in habitat suitability of all three treeline species that predicted a potential for northward and upslope advance...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop methods for mapping arboreal leaf area index (LAI) at the <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone</b> in Glacier National Park, Montana using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. A three-stage approach was tested for addressing the problem of mixed pixels in biophysical value estimation. This paper illustrates a proof of concept for this method. First, we used spectral unmixing to obtain estimates of the percentage of each pixel that was composed of tree, tundra, bare rock and shadow. Spectral signatures obtained through image interpretation were used for mixture modeling. The second step involved adjusting the pixel vegetation index (VI) values so that they represented the VI of the tree-only portion of the pixel, assuming an average VI for background components. Finally, the adjusted VI was regressed against leaf area index (LAI) measured in the field using a LiCor LAI- 2000 and spatially referenced through differential GPS. Results using the adjusted VI values were compared with unadjusted VI, as were the results obtained using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the simple ratio (SR). The results indicate that adjusted NDVI can be used to predict the LAI of trees within mixed pixels much better than does unadjusted NDVI, which overestimates the LAI because it includes non-arboreal vegetation. NDVI provided better results than did SR. A number of issues affect the accuracy of LAI estimates in practice: the accuracy of estimates of endmember proportions obtained through unmixing, the adequacy of the endmember average NDVI for removing the effects of non-arboreal NDVI contributions, the non-synchronous nature of the satellite flight and field work, and the accuracy of field estimates of LAI made using the LAI- 2000. ...|$|R
40|$|In subarctic Sweden, recent decadal {{colonization}} {{and expansion}} of aspen (Populus tremula L.) were recorded. Over the past 100 years, aspen became c. 16 times more abundant, mainly {{as a result of}} increased sexual regeneration. Moreover, aspen now reach tree-size (> 2 m) at the <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline,</b> an <b>ecotone</b> that has been dominated by mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) for at least the past 4000 years. We found that sexual regeneration in aspen probably occurred seven times or more within the last century. Whereas sexual regeneration occurred during moist years following a year with an exceptionally high June July temperature, asexual regeneration was favored by warm and dry summers. Disturbance to the birch forest by cyclic moth population outbreaks was critical in aspen establishment in the subalpine area. At the treeline, aspen colonization was less determined by these moth outbreaks, and was mainly restricted by summer temperature. If summer warming persists, aspen spread may continue in subarctic Sweden, particularly at the treeline. However, changing disturbance regimes, future herbivore population dynamics and the responses of aspen's competitors birch and pine to a changing climate may result in different outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The <b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone</b> is {{primarily}} caused by climate at continental and regional scales, but at finer scales exhibits increasing complexity and linkages with abiotic factors. In {{order to better}} understand the dynamics and geographic properties of treeline, a three-pronged study was conducted. The study 2 ̆ 7 s first objective investigated what factors account for local treeline variation by comparing a climate-based predictive surface with actual treeline elevation. After finding that a mean growing season temperature of 10. 27 °C was the strongest predictor of treeline at continental scales, statistical analyses attempted to model the differences between predicted and actual treeline elevation based on local climatic and geomorphological controls. Site elevation and latitude were found to correlate most strongly. Roughness also exerted positive influences, as well as precipitation when coupled with certain terrain factors. The second objective explored the distribution of treeline carbon at site scales by analyzing field data gathered in August 2009 in Glacier National Park, Montana. This confirmed the expected relationship of upright trees containing the highest biomass density, tundra the lowest, and krummholz in the middle. A high degree of dead organic matter was discovered, which may have important implications for treeline as a carbon source or sink when considering treeline 2 ̆ 7 s slow decomposition rates, and how these will change under climate warming. An additional analysis investigated the potential for relative biomass gain with future treeline advance, based on site and regional differences in slope and environmental lapse rates. The third objective asked what the potential for change in treeline biomass is across the western United States is by using freeze-thaw days as a proposed indicator. This potential importance is based on existing knowledge of the facilitating relationships between solifluction, surface geomorphology, and seedling establishment and survival. Freeze-thaw days were found to be highly variable, but correlated most strongly with elevation, suggesting increased temperature variability at higher elevations. The concluding chapter synthesizes the findings and maps potential biomass gain and freeze-thaw days together to highlight treeline sites and regions with the greatest potential for advance in a warming climate...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{describe}} and evaluate patterns of vegetation response to ongoing environmental changes across climate-limited (<b>alpine</b> <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone)</b> and humanmodified (temperate Himalayan oak forests) ecosystems in Nepal, central Himalaya. Methods: I used dendroclimatological techniques to examine {{spatial and temporal}} changes in tree growth responses (paper I) and recruitment patterns (paper II) to climatic variability across a dry Pinus wallichiana and a mesic Abies spectabilis <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone.</b> Trees from various ecological elevations (forest line, treeline and krummholz line) were cored, annual growth was measured and site chronology was developed for analysing climate-growth relationships. Transects were laid out between the forest line and tree species line, crossing the treeline. Seedlings, saplings and trees were sampled in each transect for age analysis. Alpha, beta and gamma diversity were studied across a forest border from a forested to open landscape in a subalpine-alpine region (paper III) and an anthropogenic disturbance gradient (paper IV). Vascular plant species richness and environmental variables were recorded in each plot (10 m × 10 m). Alpha diversity was estimated as average species richness per plot. Beta diversity was based on gradient length estimated by Detrended Correspondense Analysis (DCA). Gamma diversity was estimated as total species number present in the landscape. Main results: At the dry locality, tree growth at the forest line responded positively to warm summers and after cold winters: possibly a response to early onset of growing season. At the mesic locality, growth at lower altitudes (forest line) showed signals of drought limitation, whereas at higher altitudes, decreased growth was associated with an early onset of the monsoon. Reduced growth at the treeline {{was related to the}} high winter snow fall and delayed onset of growing season. The current treelines in both areas have remained stationary over the decades. Climate and land-use are both important factors for treeline structuring processes. Number of trees and saplings in the dry area is higher compared to the mesic area suggesting that tree establishment rate is higher in the dry area giving a higher potential for treeline advance. In a set of vertical transects sampled across the forest line, a positive correlation between canopy and temperature gradients was found. Detrended Correspondence Analysis revealed low species turnover and a continuum in species composition across the forest border ecotone. The low species turnover and minor differences in alpha diversity could be attributed to human influence. Furthermore, in differently disturbed Quercus semecarpifolia forest at Phulchoki and Ghorepani, alpha and gamma diversity show a unimodal response to disturbance gradient. Linear relationships were observed between beta diversities (ßSD and ßA) and disturbance gradient. Conclusion: Climate signals in the pattern of tree growth responses and recruitment are site-specific. Both growing season as well as non-growing season climate factors are important drivers for vegetation changes, but they vary between study areas, with altitude and with time scale (whole time-periods vs. decadal periods). Species diversity changes along environmental gradients with spatial as well as temporal scales. Further perspective: The Himalaya are under-represented in studies of vegetationclimate relationships. The main reason is logistic challenges and lack of reliable climate data from desired locations. Future research of a similar nature to the present study should include more than one species sharing the same environment, and investigate these same species in various geographic regions and ecological settings. Impacts on the ecosystem level can be investigated by quantifying and examining species diversity and other ecosystem level responses (e. g. carbon sequestration). </p...|$|R
40|$|EN] Background: Recent {{work has}} shown {{little change in}} the {{position}} of the Smith fir treeline on the south-eastern Tibetan Plateau in response to global warming. However, the relationship between tree distribution patterns within the <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotone</b> and low responsiveness is unknown, and additional constraints than climate might be major drivers of these patterns (e. g. microsite availability for regeneration). Aims: To characterise the spatial patterns of Smith fir <b>alpine</b> <b>treelines</b> and to infer the underlying processes driving their dynamics. Methods: We investigated spatial patterns of Smith fir trees across two <b>treeline</b> <b>ecotones</b> in the Sygera Mountains, south-eastern Tibetan Plateau. The O(r) -ring statistic was used to analyse the univariate and bivariate spatial point patterns of three size classes (adults, juveniles and seedlings). Results: Mature trees presented random spatial patterns. Clusters of juveniles and seedlings colonised areas not occupied by mature trees. Seedlings were clustered and established preferentially near juvenile firs, Rhododendron mats and over moss-lichen and organic matter substrates, indicating the importance of microsite availability for successful Smith fir recruitment. Conclusions: Local factors such as microsite availability may {{play a major role in}} driving recent Smith fir treeline patterns and determine the lack of significant warming-induced upward shifts of these ecotones.
