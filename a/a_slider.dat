5|$|Lieber threw three pitches: a fastball, <b>a</b> <b>slider,</b> and a changeup. The slider was {{the pitch}} Lieber {{often used to}} get outs and was most {{successful}} against right-handed batters. The changeup darted away from batters. Lieber was not a hard thrower (his fastball was in the low 90mph range); he relied on controlling his pitches to have success.|$|E
5|$|Mota {{has three}} {{different}} kinds of pitches: a fastball, <b>a</b> <b>slider,</b> and a circle changeup. The slider is the pitch he usually uses to get outs. Wildness {{has been a problem}} for him, though, and his fastball is easy to hit when thrown over the plate. In the past, he has thrown a splitter and a curveball.|$|E

40|$|Downloaded FSimulations with {{an actual}} {{measured}} disk topography {{showed that the}} femto form-factor exhibited 22 – 32 percent less FHM than the pico form-factor for a similar design. How-ever, by changing the ABS design, 35 – 40 percent less FHM was achieved within the same form-factor. By scaling down <b>a</b> pico <b>slider</b> to <b>a</b> femto <b>slider,</b> we do not necessarily achieve enhanced overall performance. Significant performance improvements in the pico form-factor can be attained if the ABS is properly designed. However, in designing a dynami-cally stable and low FHM air bearing <b>slider</b> <b>a</b> femto <b>slider</b> ultimately yields better per-formance when care is taken in designing the ABS...|$|R
5|$|De Fratus has a two-pitch {{repertoire}} {{that consists}} of a fastball and <b>a</b> <b>slider,</b> the latter of which is his out pitch. He embraces a propensity to work quickly on the mound, and use a lower arm slot. Off the field, De Fratus {{is a member of}} the Roman Catholic church, and uses baseball to strengthen his faith. He sees evangelism as a duty of Christians, and would like to go to seminary when he finishes his baseball career.|$|E
5|$|Hennessey threw five pitches: a fastball, <b>a</b> <b>slider,</b> a changeup, a curveball, and a cutter. The fastball was Hennessey's main pitch; {{he threw}} it over 60% {{of the time}} in the majors. He did not throw it very hard, {{averaging}} speeds under 90mph in 2007 and 2008. His slider was his secondary pitch, and his changeup was his third most-used pitch. Hennessey rarely used the cutter except for in 2006, when he threw it 10.1% of the time. Henessey often was plagued by a big inning, displaying a tendency to allow several runs in an inning during his starts.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, he was {{promoted}} from the Class A-Advanced level Tampa Yankees of the FSL to the Double-A level Albany-Colonie Yankees of the Eastern League, {{and then to the}} Triple-A level Columbus Clippers of the International League. Rivera finished the year with a 10–2record in 22starts, although he struggled for Columbus, recording a 5.81ERA in six starts. Beginning the 1995 season with Columbus, he was ranked by sports magazine Baseball America as the ninth-best prospect in the Yankees organization; by contrast, the publication ranked Rivera's highly touted cousin Rubén as the second-best prospect in baseball. Mariano's pitching repertoire primarily consisted of fastballs at the time, although he threw <b>a</b> <b>slider</b> and changeup as secondary pitches.|$|E

50|$|With a three-quarters {{delivery}} Sugano throws two fastballs (four-seam, shuuto/sinker) sitting 91 mph, <b>a</b> solid <b>slider,</b> <b>a</b> curveball, and a forkball. He has excellent command, {{posting a}} BB/9 of 1.8 in his NPB career.|$|R
5|$|On April 21, 2015, Davis {{pitched a}} perfect eighth inning in {{the losing side}} of a blowout against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, {{retiring}} all 3 batters he faced, all on ground balls, using only 9 pitches. Davis in high school was 23–0 with a 1.85 ERA and was the Arizona High School Pitcher of the Year, and in college he had a 2.25 ERA as a pitcher. Against the Angels he threw his fastball as high as 88 miles per hour, threw <b>a</b> <b>slider</b> in the high 70s, and threw a cutter. It {{was the first time}} the A’s had a position player pitch since Frank Menechino in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Angels {{released}} Ramírez in March 2004, {{without being}} promoted beyond the Class A level. Disappointed, Ramírez considered retiring from baseball. With {{the advice of}} his father, Ramírez decided that as Major League Baseball pitchers often relied on <b>a</b> <b>slider</b> or curveball as a complimentary pitch to their fastball, he would develop a different pitch. Ramírez spent his time that year learning a changeup on baseball fields in Miami, Florida, and did not pitch professionally during the 2004 season. Working with Maximo Soto, a fellow minor league pitcher released by the Angels, Ramírez developed his changeup to provide him with a new weapon in his pitching arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Wilson was a power pitcher. He has a {{repertoire}} of four pitches. He throws a straight four-seam fastball around 92-95mph; {{this is one of}} his main pitches. He also has <b>a</b> <b>slider,</b> a cut fastball, and a two-seam fastball. His slider traveled around 89mph. His cut fastball has allowed him to use fewer four-seam fastballs. In 2011, he started throwing the two-seam fastball as well. The two-seamer starts away on a right-handed hitter (or in to a left-handed hitter) and has dramatic inward (or outward) movement over the plate. He has also experimented with curveballs, screwballs, and knuckleballs.|$|E

5|$|In December 2010, the Royals waived Humber, {{and he was}} {{claimed by}} the Oakland Athletics, who had extra room on their 40-man roster {{at the time of}} the waiver claim. However, the team {{subsequently}} filled its 40-man roster and designated Humber for assignment later that off-season in order to make room on their roster for Guillermo Moscoso, who the Athletics acquired from the Texas Rangers in a trade during January 2011. The Chicago White Sox claimed Humber off waivers from the Athletics on January 18, 2011. He signed a contract worth $500,000 for the season. White Sox pitching coach Don Cooper worked with Humber, as he replaced his cut fastball with <b>a</b> <b>slider</b> and improved his pitching mechanics in the fashion originally recommended by Peterson in 2005.|$|E

50|$|Wada's four-seam fastball {{has good}} late life but decidedly below-average velocity, topping out at 92 mph and usually sitting at 88-89 mph. He {{compensates}} for this with his deceptive arm swing and late release point, complementing it with <b>a</b> solid-average <b>slider,</b> <b>an</b> occasional curveball, and a changeup.|$|R
25|$|In cricket, <b>a</b> <b>slider</b> {{is a type}} of {{delivery}} bowled by a wrist spin bowler. Whereas a topspinner is released with the thumb facing the batsman, <b>a</b> <b>slider</b> is bowled in a similar manner to a legbreak, but instead of imparting sidespin with the third finger, the bowler allows his fingers to roll down the back of the ball, providing a mixture of sidespin and backspin. Whereas a topspinner tends to dip more quickly and bounce higher than a normal delivery, <b>a</b> <b>slider</b> does the opposite: it carries to a fuller length and bounces less than the batsman might expect. The sliders will typically head towards the batsman with a scrambled seam (with the ball not spinning {{in the direction of the}} seam, so the seam direction is not constant, unlike in conventional spin bowling). This has less effect on the flight and bounce but absence of leg spin may deceive the batsman. Frequently the slider is bowled with a mixture of side spin and backspin. This has the effect of making the ball harder to differentiate from the leg break for the batsmen without reducing the mechanical effects caused by the backspin. This delivery may skid straight on or it may turn a small amount.|$|E
25|$|After the 234-day players strike {{ended in}} before the 1995 {{baseball}} season ever officially began, Givens {{was sent to the}} Brewers' Class AAA New Orleans Zephyrs ballclub, where he worked with pitching coach and former major-league relief pitcher Bill Campbell, who taught Givens <b>a</b> <b>slider</b> and helped him to improve his changeup.|$|E
25|$|Chamberlain threw a four-seam fastball {{that early}} in his career was {{regularly}} in the mid-to-upper 90s, topping out at 101mph. After his arm surgery, his fastball was in the 93-94mph range, topping out around 97-98. He also threw <b>a</b> <b>slider</b> anywhere from 82 to 88mph, a curveball at 78–81mph, and an occasional changeup at 83–85mph.|$|E

50|$|Moreno threw <b>a</b> sharp <b>slider,</b> <b>a</b> changeup and a cutter, {{but had a}} good {{command of}} his low-90s fastball.

25|$|Early in his career, Mussina's arsenal {{included}} a four-seam fastball that topped out at 95mph, a two-seam fastball, <b>a</b> <b>slider,</b> a changeup, and a plus knuckle-curve. He {{was always a}} finesse pitcher, and coming up through the Orioles' organization, he was often compared to Jim Palmer. He received praise for {{the ability to make}} in-game adjustments to compensate for days when he was not at his best.|$|E
25|$|When Kazmir {{was enjoying}} success {{during his first}} several seasons, his best pitches were a four-seam fastball and <b>a</b> <b>slider.</b> His fastball was {{regularly}} clocked {{in the mid to}} high 90s with excellent command, and his preferred strike-out pitch was his slider, which many scouts and other observers compared to that of Hall of Famer Steve Carlton. On the advice of teammate James Shields, he added a change-up, which also became an out pitch.|$|E
25|$|Pettitte's {{pitching}} repertoire {{included a}} four-seam and cut fastball and several off-speed pitches such as <b>a</b> <b>slider,</b> curveball, and changeup. A left-handed pitcher, {{he had an}} exceptional pickoff move to first base, which allowed him to record 98 career pickoffs. Among Yankees pitchers, Pettitte ranks first in strikeouts (2,020), third in wins (219), and tied for first in games started (438). He won the most games of any pitcher in the 2000s.|$|E
50|$|Pond {{plants such}} as elodea (anacharisan) and cabomba can also {{be left in the}} water, while human-consumed {{vegetables}} such as romaine lettuce, escarole and collard greens must be changed daily. <b>As</b> <b>sliders</b> are omnivores, insects and freshly killed fish may also be provided for protein. Commercially processed animal-based reptile food may be given too, but any sort of leftovers should be immediately removed to prevent fouling the water or turtle's habitat.|$|R
50|$|Armas uses a low-90s moving fastball and a sharp-breaking curve to {{establish}} {{what he wants}} to do with each hitter.

His slide step has improved to the point where opposing baserunners no longer take him for granted.|$|R
