5|$|Its {{status in}} the history of Danish {{photography}} is rivalled by a portrait of Bertel Thorvaldsen sitting at <b>an</b> <b>easel</b> outside his studio in the garden of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts at Charlottenborg Palace in Copenhagen. This daguerrotype was taken by the French photographer Aymard Charles Théodore Neubourg, who visited Copenhagen in the summer of 1840. An examination of the circumstances under which it was taken reveals that the date was Sunday, 26 July 1840. It has also been noticed that Thorvaldsen is making the horn sign with what apparently is his left hand although, {{as a result of the}} daguerrotype mirror effect, it is actually his right hand. This has been ascribed to the anxiety he must have experienced while facing the new mechanical device which could reveal even the slightest detail.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{the book}} Domebook One {{was a direct}} {{spin-off}} of the WEC. Lloyd Kahn, Shelter editor of the WEC, borrowed WEC production equipment for a week in 1970 and produced the first book on building geodesic domes. A year later, in 1971, Kahn again borrowed WEC equipment (an IBM Selectric Composer typesetting machine and a Polaroid MP-5 camera on <b>an</b> <b>easel),</b> and spent {{a month in the}} Santa Barbara Mountains producing Domebook 2, which went on to sell 165,000 copies. With production of DB 2, Kahn and his company Shelter Publications followed Stewart Brand's move to nationwide distribution by Random House.|$|E
25|$|By 1951, Krasner {{started her}} first series of collage paintings. To create these images, Krasner pasted cut and torn shapes onto {{all but two}} of the {{large-scale}} color field paintings she created for the Betty Parson's exhibition in 1951. This period marks the time when Krasner stopped working on <b>an</b> <b>easel</b> since she created these works by lying the support on the floor. To make these images, she would pin the separate pieces to a canvas and modify the composition until she was satisfied. She then would paste the fragments on the canvas and add color with a brush when desired. Most of the collage paintings she created recall plant or organic forms but do not completely resemble a living organism. By using many different materials, she was able to create texture and prevent the image from being entirely flat. The act of tearing and cutting elements for the collage embodies Krasner's expression since these acts are aggressive. She explored contrasts of light and dark colors, hard and soft lines, organic and geometric shapes, and structure and improvisation through these collages. These collage paintings represent Krasner's turn away from nonobjective abstraction. From this period onwards, she created metaphorical and content-laden art which alludes to organic figures or landscapes.|$|E

500|$|The {{portrait}} was in {{the possession}} of a family in Streatham, London, by the 20th century. They had long believed the portrait was of Jane, and since 1923 had tried to convince others of its authenticity, without success. It was passed from generation to generation. In December 2005, Sir John Guinness informed Foley of the family and their portrait.

50|$|A {{number of}} art historians have raised doubts as to her {{identification}} as a sibyl and instead see {{the woman as}} a personification of painting, noting the resemblance to Velázquez's Fable of Arachne. It {{has been suggested that}} Velázquez used the same model for both works, although this claim is doubted by others on the basis that Arachne's position means her face is hidden from the viewer. Other arguments against the personification of painting include the omission of either <b>a</b> <b>easel</b> or brush. Other suggestions include Clio, the muse of history, or the painter Flaminia Triunfi, whom Velázquez is known to have met in Italy.|$|R
500|$|Pictor is a {{constellation}} in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere, located between the star Canopus and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Its name is Latin for painter, {{and is an}} abbreviation of the older name Equuleus Pictoris (the [...] "painter's easel"). Normally represented as <b>an</b> <b>easel,</b> Pictor was named by Abbé Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century. The constellation's brightest star is Alpha Pictoris, a white main-sequence star around 97light-years away from Earth. Pictor also hosts RR Pictoris, a cataclysmic variable star system that flared up as a nova, reaching apparent (visual) magnitude 1.2 in 1925 before fading into obscurity.|$|E
500|$|Art can exemplify logical paradoxes, as in some {{paintings}} by the surrealist René Magritte, {{which can be}} read as semiotic jokes about confusion between levels. In La condition humaine (1933), Magritte depicts <b>an</b> <b>easel</b> (on the real canvas), seamlessly supporting a view through a window which is framed by [...] "real" [...] curtains in the painting. Similarly, Escher's Print Gallery (1956) is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which recursively contains the picture, and so ad infinitum. Magritte made use of spheres and cuboids to distort reality in a different way, painting them alongside an assortment of houses in his 1931 Mental Arithmetic as if they were children's building blocks, but house-sized. The Guardian observed that the [...] "eerie toytown image" [...] prophesied Modernism's usurpation of [...] "cosy traditional forms", but also plays with the human tendency to seek patterns in nature.|$|E
500|$|The {{journey from}} {{deciding}} {{to burn the}} money to deciding how to burn the money to actually burning the money was a long one. Jim Reid, a freelance journalist and the only independent witness to the burning, reported the various schemes the K Foundation considered. The first was offering Nailed To The Wall to the Tate Gallery as the [...] "1995 K Foundation Bequest To The Nation." [...] The condition was that the gallery must agree to display the piece for at least 10 years. If they refused, {{the money would be}} burnt. A second idea was to hire Bankside Power Station, [...] "the future site of the Tate Gallery extension and an imposing building downstream from the South Bank", as a bonfire venue. In typical KLF 'guerrilla communication' style, [...] "posters were to appear on 15 August bearing the legend 'The 1995 K Foundation Bequest To The Nation', under which would have been an image of Nailed To The Wall on <b>an</b> <b>easel</b> and two flame-throwers lying on the floor. On 24 August a new poster would go up, exactly the same as the first except that this time the work would be burnt." ...|$|E

500|$|Inspired by flip books his son Robert brought home, McCay said he [...] "came {{to see the}} {{possibility}} of making moving pictures" [...] of his cartoons. [...] McCay, then in his early forties, asserted he was [...] "the first {{man in the world}} to make animated films", but he was likely familiar with the earlier work of American James Stuart Blackton and the French Émile Cohl. [...] In 1900, Blackton produced The Enchanted Drawing, a trick film in which an artist interacts with a drawing on <b>an</b> <b>easel.</b> [...] Blackton used chalk drawings in 1906 to animate the film Humorous Phases of Funny Faces, and used stop motion techniques to animate a scene in the 1907 film The Haunted Hotel. [...] Cohl's films, such as 1908's Fantasmagorie, were dreamlike nonnarrative pieces in which characters and scenes continually changed shape. [...] Cohl's films were first distributed in the United States in 1909, the year McCay said he first became interested in animation. [...] According to McCay biographer John Canemaker, McCay combined the interactive qualities of Blackton's films with the abstract, shapeshifting qualities of Cohl's into his own films. [...] In the films of all three, the artist interacts with the animation.|$|E
500|$|Alone {{amongst the}} Ikuntji artists, Daisy Jugadai worked at <b>an</b> <b>easel.</b> She cited the Hermannsburg School, {{a group of}} Indigenous artists {{including}} Albert Namatjira who began painting at Hermannsburg Mission in the 1930s, as an influence on her work. Memory and Five Mile Creek (1995) represents the country of her childhood. It shows the hills of the region in elevation rather than in plan, and represents the range of vegetation typical of that country. Curator Marina Strocchi notes how Daisy Jugadai's painting reflects close observation of the complex structures of the vegetation and environment, its features [...] "obsessively detailed", with the artist [...] "devotedly [...] all the bush tucker of that area", as well as choosing [...] "a time of year in which to depict her country". Vegetation would be carefully painted with a trimmed brush, while even finer detail, such as pollen, would be rendered using a matchstick. Clouds were always the final features to be included. Despite this devotion to detail, Daisy preferred to paint large canvasses. Memory and Five Mile Creek {{was included in the}} National Gallery of Victoria's 2004–05 exhibition [...] "Aboriginal Art Post 1984" [...] and reviewer Miriam Cosic, while noting its [...] "naive charm", also drew attention to the work's title and the implication that, like other more explicitly political painters of her era, [...] "she too is talking of violent dispossession".|$|E

5000|$|Artists' easels {{typically}} are fully adjustable to accommodate for different angles. Most have built-in anti-skid plates on the feet to prevent sliding.
