5|$|Along with Annie Smith Peck, Workman was {{recognized}} {{during the early}} 20th century {{as one of the}} most famous female climbers in the world. Their rivalry demonstrated that women could climb the most remote <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> terrain on the planet. Women had climbed regularly in the Alps since the 1850s, but in the Himalayas, mountaineering had been dominated by wealthy English men. No other women, however, climbed in the Himalaya until well after World War I, by which time improvements in equipment and organization had shifted that nature of risks and difficulties of expeditions.|$|E
5|$|Dreamtime was a {{controversial}} best-seller upon its initial release in West Germany, and inspired academic debate {{leading to the}} publication of Der Gläserne Zaun (1983), an anthology discussing Duerr's ideas, edited by Rolf Gehlen and Bernd Wolf. Reviews in the Anglophone world were mixed, with critics describing Dreamtime as unoriginal, factually inaccurate, <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> to read, but also innovative and well referenced.|$|E
5|$|Fertility {{control is}} a {{non-lethal}} method of population management that is usually viewed as the most humane treatment, and its use {{is supported by the}} RSPCA. While it appears as though these treatments are effective in the breeding season immediately following injection, the lasting effects are debated. Because it is costly <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> to treat animals repeatedly, this method, despite being ideal, is not widely implemented.|$|E

30|$|Ventilator-associated {{pneumonia}} (VAP) is {{the most}} common infectious complication in critically ill patients.

50|$|The mass {{of a long}} gun {{is usually}} {{greater than that of}} a short gun, making the long gun more {{expensive}} to transport, <b>and</b> more <b>difficult</b> <b>and</b> tiring to carry. The increased moment of inertia makes the long gun slower <b>and</b> more <b>difficult</b> to traverse <b>and</b> elevate, and it is thus slower <b>and</b> more <b>difficult</b> to adjust the aim. However, this also results in greater stability in aiming. The greater amount of material in a long gun tends to make it more expensive to manufacture, other factors being equal. The greater size makes it more <b>difficult</b> to conceal, <b>and</b> more inconvenient to use in confined quarters, as well as requiring a larger storage space.|$|R
5|$|He {{drew and}} painted {{numerous}} preparatory sketches while deciding which of several alternative {{moments of the}} disaster he would depict in the final work.

5|$|However, this winding route {{proved to}} be too {{dangerous}} <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> for the explosion of vehicle traffic that occurred after World War II. Alvinston was originally reliant on the Canada Southern Railroad, which {{was taken over by}} the Michigan Central Railway and that by New York Central. However, by 1960 the use of the rails had declined so much that service was stopped. The tracks were lifted two years later.|$|E
5|$|In the air, {{there were}} also two {{competing}} designs, originating from groups of different backgrounds and needs. The Army Signal Corps, representing military aviators, preferred a solution based on a stream of audio navigation signals, constantly fed into the pilots' ears via a headset. Civilian pilots on the other hand, who were mostly airmail pilots flying cross-country to deliver the mail, felt the audio signals would be annoying <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> to use over long flights, and preferred a visual solution, with an indicator in the instrument panel.|$|E

5|$|Miguel de Benavides {{was born}} in 1550 in the Castilian town of Carrión de los Condes, {{province}} of Palencia, Spain, {{in the heart of}} the austere, grain-producing Tierra de Campos. Benavides was steeped in the theological principles of Francisco de Vitoria and Bartolomé de las Casas, who exchanged the prestigious professorial chair for remote <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> new missions of the Philippines. He was chosen to govern the newly created Diocese of Nueva Segovia (now Vigan) as its First Bishop (1595–1601). He wrote the Doctrina Christiana in Chinese, the first book printed in the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|Old English is very {{different}} from Modern English <b>and</b> <b>difficult</b> for 21st-century English speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German, and its closest relative is Old Frisian. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms, and word order was much freer than in Modern English. Modern English has case forms in pronouns (he, him, his) and a few verb endings (I have, he has), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more person and number endings.|$|E
