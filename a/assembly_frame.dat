50|$|The MGL grenade {{launcher}} {{consists of a}} lightweight, progressively rifled steel barrel, sight <b>assembly,</b> <b>frame</b> with firing mechanism, spring-actuated revolving cylinder magazine, and a folding stock. The weapon has a fire selector safety switch just above the rear pistol grip which can be operated from either side. The launcher cannot be accidentally discharged if dropped.The launcher is loaded by releasing the cylinder axis pin and swinging the steel frame away from the cylinder. The rear of the cylinder (including the pistol grip) is unlatched and pivoted counter-clockwise to expose the chambers during reloading. By inserting the fingers into the empty chambers and rotating the aluminium cylinder it is then wound against its driving spring. The grenades are then inserted into the chambers, one-by-one (because the cylinder cannot be removed), the frame closed, and the axis pin re-engaged to lock. When the trigger is pressed a double-action takes place and the firing pin is cocked and released to fire the grenade. Gas pressure on a piston unlocks the cylinder and allows the spring to rotate it until the next chamber is aligned with the firing pin, whereupon the next round can be fired. If a misfire occurs the trigger can be pulled repeatedly.|$|E

40|$|The {{motion of}} the weeding disc at any point {{on the surface of}} a rotary tiller travels was studied. Parametric {{equations}} were used to describe the motion of path followed by the weeding tines. The effective performance of soil working tool was related to the kinematic parameter of the soil working tools, the forward travel distance and speed of the rotary tines and working action of components of weeding tool. The design parameters for appropriate soil working tools and implements were established. The weeder consists of a 5 hp-petrol engine, three ground wheels (pneumatic), tool <b>assembly,</b> <b>frame</b> and handle. The construction of the powered rotary weeder was done in the workshop of the Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria. The performance of the weeder was investigated by considering the effects of four (4) weeding tools (Iron rod tine, Cable tine, Line yard tine and Plastic strand tine) and three (3) levels of weeding speeds (1804 rpm, 2435 rpm, 3506 rpm) on the weeding index, weeding efficiency and field capacity. The data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using a 4  3 factorial experiment in a randomized complete block design. The analysis of results indicated that the forward speeds of 0. 4 m/s to 0. 5 m/s and engine speeds of 1804 rpm to 2261 rpm resulted in weeding efficiency of 54. 98...|$|E

40|$|The work {{investigates the}} {{application}} of a novel frame model to reduce the computational cost of the mistuning analysis of bladed disc systems. A full-scale finite element (FE) model of the bladed disc is considered as benchmark. The single blade frame configuration is identified via an optimization process. The individual blades are then assembled by 3 D springs, whose parameters are determined via calibration process. The dynamics of the novel beam <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> is also compared to those obtained from three state-of-the-art FE-based reduced order models (ROMs) : a lumped parameter approach; a Timoshenko beam assembly, and component mode synthesis (CMS) based techniques with free and fixed interfaces. The development of these classical ROMs to represent the bladed disc is also addressed in detail. A methodology to perform the mistuning analysis is then proposed and implemented. A comparison of the modal properties and forced response dynamics between the aforementioned ROMs and the full-scale FE model is presented. The case study demonstrates that the beam <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> can predict the variations of the blade amplitude factors with results being in agreement with the full-scale FE model. The CMS based ROMs underestimate the maximum amplitude factor, while the results obtained from beam <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> are generally conservative. The beam <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> is 4 times more computationally efficient than the CMS fixed-interface approach. This study proves that the beam <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> can efficiently predict the mistuning behavior of bladed discs when low order modes are of interest...|$|R

40|$|In {{aircraft}} <b>assembly,</b> <b>frames</b> {{are usually}} {{used as the}} skeleton shape benchmarks of a fuselage panel to locate other parts accurately, thereby coordinating the relative position relationships between each part. In order to guarantee the assembly quality, a methodology for analyzing the effect of positioning errors of frames on fuselage panel assembly deformation is proposed. A finite element model of the fuselage panel is established first and then a mathematical model for representing the assembly deformation is derived. To contain more assembly deformation information, the optimal measurement point placement method is adopted to extract a set of finite element nodes as the measurement point locations from a large candidate set. Meanwhile, the mathematical relationship between the position errors of measurement points and the positioning errors of frames is also determined, which is then combined with the Monte Carlo simulation and the grey relational analysis to quantitatively analyze the impacts of the positioning error(s) generated by single or multiple frames on fuselage panel assembly deformation...|$|R

Following irradiation in this cycle and while reconfiguring the experiment in the ATR canal, a non-fueled component (the bottom plate) of the first fuel plate <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> became separated from the rail sides. There {{is no evidence that}} the fueled region of the fuel plate <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> was compromised by this incident or the irradiation conditions. The separation of this component was determined to have been caused by flow induced vibrations, where vortex shedding frequencies were resonant with a natural frequency of the bottom plate component. This gave way to amplification, fracture, and separation from the assembly. Although parallel flow induced vibrations were analyzed, vortex shedding flow induced vibrations was an unfamiliar failure mode that was difficult to identify. Both the once-irradiated first fuel plate and un-irradiated second fuel plate <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies</b> were planned for irradiation in the subsequent cycle 151 B. The AFIP- 6 MKII experiment was excluded from irradiation in cycle 151 B because non-trivial design modifications would be needed to mitigate this type of incident during the second irradiation cycle.
