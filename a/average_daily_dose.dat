40|$|The Multimedia Environmental Pollutant Assessment System (MEPAS) {{provides}} physics-based {{models for}} human health risk assessment for radioactive and hazardous pollutants. MEPAS analyzes pollutant behavior in various media (air, soil, groundwater and surface water) and estimates transport through and between media and exposure and impacts to the environment, to the maximum individual, and to populations. MEPAS includes 25 exposure pathway models, a database with information on more than 650 contaminants, and a sensitivity module that allows for uncertainty analysis. Four major transport pathways are considered in MEPAS: groundwater, overland, surface water, and atmospheric. This report describes the exposure pathway and health impact assessment component of MEPAS, which provides an estimate of health impacts to selected individuals and populations from exposure to pollutants. The exposure pathway analysis starts with pollutant concentration in a transport medium and estimates the <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>dose</b> to exposed individuals from contact with the transport medium or a secondary medium contaminated by the transport medium.

Literature data on exposure concentrations from more than 15 different countries and adverse health effects on test animals as well as human epidemiological studies were used. The risk assessment showed no overlap between the highest human exposure dose (EXPD) and the lowest human equivalent dose (HED) from animal test data, for TCM, BDCM, DBCM, TBM, DCAA and TCAA.

Demographic data, information on theophylline dosing and blood sampling was collected from patients’ data files. Authors evaluated {{the appropriateness of the}} following procedures: indications for theophylline serum concentration measurement, timing of blood sampling and dosage adjustments made after theophylline levels had been reported. On the basis of collected data, population pharmacokinetic model for theophylline was built and further used for the evaluation of dosage adjustments.   Results Out of 127 cases, 107 (84. 3 %) had clinically justified indication for theophylline serum level measurement. Near half of measurements (44. 9 %) were performed before the steady state of theophylline concentrations was established. 65 % of measured concentrations were subtherapeutic and the average measured concentration was below therapeutic range (53. 1 μmol/L).
