40|$|Abstract. The GaAs 1 -xNx <b>alloy</b> <b>semiconductor</b> {{has been}} grown on GaAs (001), (111) A and (011) {{substrates}} by metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy. High resolution X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering {{were employed to}} examine the effective N content and the growth rate, {{as a function of}} the substrate-surface orientation. The growth rate, which was assessed though the clear Pendellösung fringes, and the N content were found to change dramatically with the substrate-surface orientations. The N content was determined in the order (111) A> (001) > (011). While, the growth rate is in the order, (001) > (011) > (111) A. The effect of substrate-surface orientation on the N incorporation found in the present study is interpreted in terms of the difference in the growth rate on each surface orientation and the number of dangling bonds with which the N atoms can be trapped on the growing surface. Our results show that controlled nitrogen incorporating for GaAsN is successfully achieved and can be applied to the fabrication of some novel structures such as a spontaneous N content modulated structure, which is applicable to high performance long wavelength laser diodes...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} to modify {{the basic structure of}} an nBn infrared photodetector so that a plain electron-donor- type (n-type) semiconductor contact layer would be replaced by a graded n-type III V <b>alloy</b> <b>semiconductor</b> layer (i. e., ternary or quarternary) with appropriate doping gradient. The abbreviation nBn refers to one aspect of the unmodified basic device structure: There is an electron-barrier ("B") layer between two n-type ("n") layers, as shown in {{the upper part of the}} figure. One of the n-type layers is the aforementioned photon-absorption layer; the other n-type layer, denoted the contact layer, collects the photocurrent. The basic unmodified device structure utilizes minority-charge-carrier conduction, such that, for reasons too complex to explain within the space available for this article, the dark current at a given temperature can be orders of magnitude lower (and, consequently, signal-to-noise ratios can be greater) than in infrared detectors of other types. Thus, to obtain a given level of performance, less cooling (and, consequently, less cooling equipment and less cooling power) is needed. [In principle, one could obtain the same advantages by means of a structure that would be called pBp because it would include a barrier layer between two electron-acceptor- type (p-type) layers. ] The proposed modifications could make it practical to utilize nBn photodetectors in conjunction with readily available, compact thermoelectric coolers in diverse infrared- imaging applications that could include planetary exploration, industrial quality control, monitoring pollution, firefighting, law enforcement, and medical diagnosis...|$|E
