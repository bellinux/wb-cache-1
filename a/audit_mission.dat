40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to inquire if the young and future {{financial}} auditors are fully aware of the impact that information security has on <b>audit</b> <b>missions,</b> focusing also on the responsibilities of the participants in financial <b>audit</b> <b>missions,</b> regarding the assessment of the risks derived from information security. To determine the extent to which audit risk might be influenced by information security, a literature review was conducted, that has focused on this current concern, as expressed by different researchers, professional bodies, Big Four companies and the regulators. In order to assess the current level of awareness regarding the impact of information security on the audit risk, 25 young professionals have participated to a survey and with their answers have proven that they realize the impact of information securing on <b>audit</b> <b>missions</b> and the necessity of having sufficient knowledge regarding information technology in order to identify the risk from the information security area which might affect the financial statements and the activity of the organization. Moreover, young and future financial auditors are aware of the fact that the audit profession will suffer modifications due to the changes in the information technology field, which will affect the approaches in <b>audit</b> <b>missions</b> and in this regards the financial auditors must develop new working skills such as understanding information systems and information security and possessing skills in analysis and data modelling. Besides the survey used, five auditors who work in Big Four companies were interviewed, in order to highlight the way in which the profession is adapting to technological changes, especially in the case of assessing controls of information technology systems and information security. From the results of the interview it can be concluded that within the Big Four companies, there is a high level of awareness regarding the necessity of solid knowledge in the information technology field.

40|$|AbstractThe {{optimization}} of {{the audit}} process {{has always been a}} priority for audit academics and professionals. Following a review {{of the audit}} literature on this topic, we conclude there is a consensus among authors that one of the auditor's primary concerns is to optimize the allocation of resources for <b>audit</b> <b>missions</b> while keeping the audit risk at an acceptable level. This paper focuses on one of the key issues identified by various authors regarding the optimization of the audit process: selecting the m of the audit team. All audit firms are aware that the human resource is their most important asset and recognize the importance of finding the balance between the skills of audit team members and the complexity of audit engagements. The main purpose of this optimization process is to help auditors not taking unnecessary risks avoid under-auditing and to keep costs to a competitive level avoid over-auditing. We propose a multiple regression model for determining the optimum number of hours to be involved on audit engagements depending on several client related parameters e. g. financial performance indicators, client size, complexity of client operations, etc. Further, we examine the possibility of using the model for creating an expert system that would assist in selecting the right mix of audit team members depending on their experience and skills...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{professional}} {{bodies as}} well as public authorities are setting up new regulations and standards in order to deploy risk management approaches in the non-financial industries. For instance, Switzerland has recently introduced a new regulation on Internal control that forces most SMEs to implement an ICS (Internal Control System). However, introducing or dealing with new risk control regulations might not bring the desired effect to the organisation: logistical and psychological barriers might indeed affect its proper deployment. It {{is well known that}} regulations are effective when each individual understands, accepts and attempts to comply with it. To deal with these issues, we have conducted a survey research from October to December 2007 to measure the perception of Geneva population regarding the main aspects of risk management within the organisations they work for. In particular, we attempt to answer to the following questions: what are the main risks at your workplace? And within your organisation? What do you think about internal <b>audit</b> <b>missions?</b> What would you do if risks occurred within your organisation? 417 people have answered to a questionnaire created by LEM (Laboratoire d’Études de Marché), a Geneva Haute École de Gestion research laboratory. Among results, we observe that poor management and infrastructure, poor performance and fraud detection are perceived as the main risk management issues. Moreover people associate an internal control procedure mainly with a performance and/or financial control. We also discover that an internal and confidential whistle-blowing system would not be well accepted in Geneva. These and other related topics (poor work atmosphere, fault at work…) have been analysed, research hypotheses have been verified on the basis of non-parametrical tests.
