5|$|The East German {{government}} {{sought to}} define {{the country as a}} legitimate state in its own right and portrayed West Germany as enemy territory (feindliches Ausland)– <b>a</b> <b>capitalist,</b> semi-fascist state that exploited its citizens, sought to regain the lost territories of the Third Reich, and stood opposed to the peaceful socialism of the GDR.|$|E
5|$|The United States has <b>a</b> <b>capitalist</b> {{mixed economy}} which {{is fueled by}} {{abundant}} natural resources and high productivity. According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP of $16.8 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 19% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP).|$|E
5|$|The Sea Wolf, {{released}} in 1941, {{was based on}} Jack London's novel. Although the film had a strong cast and production, Rossen's re-draft of the script may be the greatest influence on the film. While the character of Captain Larsen remained both victim and oppressed in <b>a</b> <b>capitalist</b> hierarchy, he {{became a symbol of}} fascism. He split the novel's idealist hero into an intellectual bosun and a rebellious seaman. Warner Bros. cut many political points during production.|$|E

3000|$|... 22 <b>A</b> venture <b>capitalist’s</b> {{industry}} {{is defined as}} the industry where he made his first investment, which is also considered the date on which he started operating as <b>a</b> venture <b>capitalist</b> in China. Recall that investments typically take several years to either succeed or fail, and that <b>a</b> venture <b>capitalist</b> supervises several investments over a career. Thus, the lag between my instrument and the dates of most of the outcomes I am examining is considerably greater than one year.|$|R

5|$|By 1960, the Cold War raged {{between two}} superpowers: the United States, <b>a</b> <b>capitalist</b> liberal democracy, and the Soviet Union (USSR), a Marxist–Leninist socialist state {{ruled by the}} Communist Party. Expressing {{contempt}} for the U.S., Castro shared the ideological views of the USSR, establishing relations with several Marxist–Leninist states. Meeting with Soviet First Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan, Castro agreed to provide the USSR with sugar, fruit, fibers, and hides, in return for crude oil, fertilizers, industrial goods, and a $100 million loan. Cuba's government ordered the country's refineries – then controlled by the U.S. corporations Shell and Esso – to process Soviet oil, but under U.S. pressure, they refused. Castro responded by expropriating and nationalizing the refineries. Retaliating, the U.S. cancelled its import of Cuban sugar, provoking Castro to nationalize most U.S.-owned assets on the island, including banks and sugar mills.|$|E
5|$|Mugabe's {{government}} {{continued to}} make regular pronouncements about converting Zimbabwe into a socialist society, although did not take concrete steps in that direction. In contrast to Mugabe's talk of socialism, his government's budgetary policies were conservative, operating within <b>a</b> <b>capitalist</b> framework and emphasising the need for foreign investment. In office, Mugabe sought a gradual transformation away from capitalism and tried to build upon existing state institutions. From 1980 to 1990, the country's economy grew {{by an average of}} 2.7% a year, but this was outstripped by population growth and real income declined. The unemployment rate rose, reaching 26% in 1990. The government ran a budget deficit year-on-year that averaged at 10% of the country's gross domestic product. Under Mugabe's leadership, there was a massive expansion in education and health spending. In 1980, Zimbabwe had 177 secondary schools, but by 2000 this number had risen to 1,548. During that period, the adult literacy rate rose from 62% to 82%, one of the best records in Africa. Levels of child immunisation were raised from 25% of the population to 92%.|$|E

25|$|However, in 1933 the Surrealists’ {{assertion}} that a 'proletarian literature' within <b>a</b> <b>capitalist</b> society was impossible {{led to their}} break with the Association des Ecrivains et Artistes Révolutionnaires, and the expulsion of Breton, Éluard and Crevel from the Communist Party.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the Polish reform {{movement}} Solidarity became crucial {{in bringing about}} a peaceful transition from a communist state to <b>a</b> <b>capitalist</b> economic system and a liberal parliamentary democracy.

25|$|U.S. leaders, {{following}} {{the principles of}} the Atlantic Charter, hoped to shape the postwar world by opening up the world's markets to international trade. Administration analysts eventually reached the conclusion that rebuilding <b>a</b> <b>capitalist</b> Western Europe that could again serve as a hub in world affairs was essential to sustaining U.S. prosperity.|$|E
25|$|Most modern social liberals, {{including}} centrist or left-of-center political groups, {{believe that}} the capitalist economic system should be fundamentally preserved, but the status quo regarding the income gap must be reformed. Social liberals favor <b>a</b> <b>capitalist</b> system with active Keynesian macroeconomic policies and progressive taxation (to even out differences in income inequality).|$|E
25|$|The US is {{an example}} of a bureaucratic state in which infrastructural power outweighs despotic power. Mann {{attributes}} this fact to the US' status as a modern, industrialized state. As <b>a</b> <b>capitalist</b> democracy, it has the advantages of an active civil society and a system of taxation; each provide means for increasing infrastructural capacity.|$|E

25|$|Zhuhai {{became a}} city in 1979, a year before it was {{designated}} {{as one of the}} first Special Economic Zones of China (SEZ). Similarly to neighboring Shenzhen, which became the first Special Economic Zone of China in 1978, the implementation of Zhuhai as an SEZ was largely due to its strategic position facing Macau, <b>a</b> <b>capitalist</b> trading center similar to Shenzhen's position with Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|The capitalists (sahib al-mal) {{stood at}} the height of their power between the 9th and 12th centuries, but their {{influence}} declined after the arrival of the ikta (landowners) and after the state monopolized production; both these trends hampered any development of industrial capitalism in the Islamic world. Some state enterprises still had <b>a</b> <b>capitalist</b> mode of production, such as pearl diving in Iraq and the textile industry in Egypt.|$|E
25|$|Classical economics, {{developed}} in the 18th and 19th centuries, included a value theory and distribution theory. The value of a product was thought {{to depend on the}} costs involved in producing that product. The explanation of costs in Classical economics was simultaneously an explanation of distribution. A landlord received rent, workers received wages, and <b>a</b> <b>capitalist</b> tenant farmer received profits on their investment. This classic approach included the work of Adam Smith and David Ricardo.|$|E

25|$|By 1940, {{only a small}} {{committed}} core {{remained in}} the Socialist Party, including a considerable percentage of militant pacifists. The SP continued to oppose Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal as <b>a</b> <b>capitalist</b> palliative, arguing for fundamental change through socialist ownership. In 1940 Norman Thomas was the only presidential candidate who failed to support rearmament military support of Great Britain and China. The pacifist Thomas also served as an active spokesman for the isolationist America First Committee during 1941.|$|E
25|$|The Communist regime {{which was}} {{installed}} in late 1947 outlawed the PNȚ altogether, alleging that Mihalache and Maniu {{had been trying to}} flee the country from the airfield in Tămădău, and had planned to give Romania <b>a</b> <b>capitalist</b> government-in-exile. Their capture (see Tămădău Affair) and trial by a kangaroo court led to sentences of life imprisonment with requirements of penal labour, effectively death sentences; Mihalache, after having passed through Sighet prison, died in custody at Râmnicu Sărat prison.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{repression}} {{is strongly}} linked with social oppression, which levers on it. It is thanks to psychological repression that individuals are transformed into docile servants of social repression {{who come to}} desire self-repression and who accept a miserable life as employees for capitalism. <b>A</b> <b>capitalist</b> society needs a powerful tool to counteract the explosive force of desire, which {{has the potential to}} threaten its structures of exploitation, servitude, and hierarchy; the nuclear family is precisely the powerful tool able to counteract those forces.|$|E
