5|$|Animal {{husbandry}} is {{the branch}} of agriculture concerned with <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> raised for meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other products. It includes day-to-day care, selective breeding and the raising of livestock.|$|E
5|$|Although Triatominae bugs feed on them, birds {{appear to}} be immune to {{infection}} and therefore are {{not considered to be}} a T. cruzi reservoir. Even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters, they can re-emerge from plants or <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> part of the ancient, sylvatic (referring to wild animals) infection cycle. This is especially likely in zones with mixed open savannah, with clumps of trees interspersed by human habitation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{most active}} {{at dawn and}} dusk, when {{temperatures}} are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning and evening light helps make them less visible to predators, but is bright enough {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E
30|$|There was a {{significant}} difference in feed consumption of animals. Feed consumption for <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> fed with 500  g kg− 1 dietary protein was significantly lower (P <  0.05) than those <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> fed with dietary protein of 210, 300, and 350  g kg− 1 in the second protein trial. The highest feed efficiency ratio tracked the weight gain of those <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> fed with the 350  g kg− 1 dietary protein and was significantly higher than 500  g kg− 1 diet.|$|R

5|$|Global {{warming is}} {{expected}} to have a number of negative long-term ecological impacts on the region, including drought, increased forest fires, forest degradation to drought and disease, and less healthy or nonexistent salmon runs. The distribution and survival of plant species, especially those that inhabit alpine environments, as well as <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> specifically adapted to those environments, will also be adversely affected. Glaciers are also expected to recede due to a decreased buildup of snowpack and higher overall temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Other discoveries include various {{plants and}} <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{thought to have}} formed part of their diet, e.g. wild banana, breadfruit, and fish bones, and {{articles}} that were used as personal ornaments such as shell pendants and shark beads, indicating occasional contact with the coast around 40km away. It is also likely that Balangoda Man visited Horton Plains in the central highlands of Sri Lanka during their annual cycle of gathering foods such as cereals, and hunting animals, most likely wild cattle, sambur, and deer.|$|E
5|$|Since {{opening in}} 1962, the zoo {{has focused on}} animal {{conservation}} efforts. Programs at the Phoenix Zoo include captive breeding for reintroduction (for instance the Arabian oryx, black-footed ferret, Mexican wolf, Ramsey Canyon leopard frog, and thick-billed parrot, sanctuary for <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> no longer breeding (for instance the African painted dogs at the zoo), and rescue and rehabilitation (for instance lead poisoning treatments for the California condor).|$|E

5|$|The park's Wildlife Conservation Education Centre has {{lectures and}} video shows about {{wildlife}} and guided {{tours of the}} park and animal orphanage. These tours are primarily, but not exclusively, to educate schools and local communities. There has been criticism about animals' housing, and they now have more spacious housing in a more natural environment. The Kenya Wildlife Service has created a Safari Walk that highlights the variety of plants and <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> in Kenya, and how they affect Kenya's population.|$|E
5|$|The zoo {{has been}} {{conservation}} minded from its inception. Soon after it opened it hosted what {{was thought to}} be the last few Arabian oryx, which formed the basis of the world herd created for Operation Oryx and eventually allowed the reintroduction of the species into the wild. It now includes a sanctuary to care for <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> endangered or unwanted.|$|E
5|$|<b>Animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{important}} to the marsh rice rat's diet include insects, fiddler crabs, and snails, but the species is known to eat many other animals, including fish, clams, and juvenile Graptemys and Chrysemys turtles. They scavenge on carcasses of muskrats, deermice, and sparrows, and {{may be the most}} important predator on eggs and young of the marsh wren. Rice rats also eat eggs and young of the seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus) and are aggressive towards the sparrow, apparently leading it to avoid nesting in Juncus in a seaside salt marsh in Florida. On islands in North Carolina, rice rats consume eggs of Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri). They have been observed preying on alligator eggs in Georgia.|$|E
50|$|Common {{subject matters}} include the <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> hunted (e.g. reindeer, horses, bison, birds and mammoth) and predators and other <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not (e.g. lions, other big cats, bears and the woolly rhinoceros); {{the human form}} was often {{expressed}} - especially female shapes (they often look either: young, old, or pregnant). Men are also depicted, such as the 'Pin Hole man'.|$|R
40|$|The human gastric {{pathogen}} Helicobacter pylori expresses several putative outer-membrane proteins (OMPs), but {{the role}} of individual OMPs in colonization of the stomach by H. pylori is still poorly understood. The role of four such OMPs (AlpA, AlpB, OipA and HopZ) in a guinea pig model of H. pylori infection has been investigated. Single alpA, alpB, hopZ and oipA isogenic mutants were constructed in the guinea pig-adapted, wild-type H. pylori strain GP 15. Guinea pigs were inoculated intragastrically with the wild-type strain, single mutants or a mixture of the wild-type and a single mutant in a 1 : 1 ratio. Three weeks after infection, H. pylori could be isolated from stomach sections of all <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> infected with the wild-type, the hopZ mutant or the oipA mutant, but from only five of nine (P = 0. 18) and one of seven (P = 0. 02) <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> infected with the alpA or alpB mutants, respectively. The hopZ and oipA mutants colonized the majority of <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> inoculated with the strain mixture, whereas alpA and alpB mutants could not <b>be</b> isolated from <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> infected with the strain mixture (P < 0. 01). Specific IgG antibody responses were observed in all <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> infected with either the wild-type or a mutant, but IgG levels <b>were</b> lower in <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> infected with either the alpA or the alpB mutants, compared to the wild-type strain (P < 0. 05). In conclusion, absence of AlpA or AlpB is a serious disadvantage for colonization of the stomach by H. pylori...|$|R

5|$|Another {{similarity}} {{with the}} stegosaurs is the narrow head, which might indicate a selective diet consisting of high-quality fodder. However, Barrett {{pointed out that}} for an animal the size of Scelidosaurus, with a large gut allowing efficient fermentation, the intake of easily digestible food of high energetic value was less important than with smaller <b>animals,</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> often critically dependent on it. Norman concluded that Scelidosaurus fed on low scrubby vegetation, with a height up to one metre. Raising itself on its hindlimbs alone, could have vertically increased the feeding envelope and was perhaps anatomically possible, but Norman doubted it was a relevant part of its behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{occupy a}} wide range of {{ecological}} positions. While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. Forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers. Avivores are <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> specialised at preying on birds.|$|E
5|$|Fenton and Licht {{note that}} the effect of a rattlesnake's {{rattling}} could be deimatic (startle) in inexperienced animals, whether predators or large animals that might injure the snake by stepping on it, but aposematic (a warning signal) in <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> aware of the rattle's meaning. They refer to the work of Fenton and his colleague David Bates on the responses of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to the defensive clicks made by moths in the family Arctiidae, which includes the garden tiger moth, Arctia caja. This family includes large, furry, bitter-tasting or poisonous moths. They found that while sounds can startle inexperienced bats, after a few trials the bats ignored the sounds if the prey was edible; but the same sounds can warn experienced bats of bitter-tasting prey (an honest signal).|$|E

5|$|However, other discoveries and {{analyses}} soon followed, revealing similar-looking {{animals such as}} Anomalocaris from the Burgess Shale and Kerygmachela from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, Aysheaia, was considered very similar to modern Onychophora, which are regarded as close relatives of arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> thought to be close relatives of arthropods but lack jointed limbs. There is still debate about whether lobopods are monophyletic, i.e. whether they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, and about whether arthropods are a sub-group of lobopods or a sister-group.|$|E
5|$|In saurischian dinosaurs, higher metabolisms were {{supported}} by {{the evolution of the}} avian respiratory system, characterized by an extensive system of air sacs that extended the lungs and invaded many of the bones in the skeleton, making them hollow. Early avian-style respiratory systems with air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than mammals of similar size and build could sustain. In addition to providing a very efficient supply of oxygen, the rapid airflow would have been an effective cooling mechanism, which is essential for <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> active but too large {{to get rid of all}} the excess heat through their skin.|$|E
5|$|Loss {{of hybrid}} vigour occurs and {{phenotype}} varies greatly in subsequent generations if F1 hybrids are inter-bred or backcrossed with animals genetically {{similar to the}} F1 parent. Inter-bred F1 hybrids will produce progeny that can be either heterozygous for each gene variant, homozygous for one gene variant, or homozygous for the other gene variant. When one of the variants has a large effect on a trait, for example the effect of myostatin variants on muscularity, larger phenotypic variation will occur among the progeny. Backcross progeny will have less phenotypic variation and comprise <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> either heterozygous for each gene variant or homozygous for the variant found in the original F1 backcross parent.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the species}} once {{inhabited}} rainforests, swamps, and cloud forests in India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China. In historical times, they lived in southwest China, particularly in Sichuan. They are now critically endangered, with only five substantial populations in the wild: four on Sumatra and one on Borneo. Their numbers are difficult to determine because they are solitary <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> widely scattered across their range, but they are estimated to number fewer than 100. Survival of the Peninsular Malaysia population is in doubt, {{and one of the}} Sumatran populations may already be extinct. In 2015, researchers announced that the Bornean rhinoceros had become extinct from the northern part of Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia); however, a tiny population was discovered in East Kalimantan in early 2016.|$|E
5|$|The first Brahmousin cattle were {{produced}} from a multiple embryo transfer from a French-imported Limousin dam. The resulting progeny were then crossed with Brahman cattle {{to achieve an}} F1 hybrid. Further crosses over a broader base led {{to the production of}} the 5/8 Limousin – 3/8 Brahman Brahmousin purebred, a mix which {{has been found to be}} the most widely accepted and most useful for the majority of the USA. The American Brahmousin Council allows <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not purebred to be recorded as percentage animals as long as they are at least one-quarter Limousin and one-quarter Brahman. In order to be recorded as a purebred Brahmousin, the animal must then be sired by a registered purebred or fullblood Limousin bull, registered Brahman bull or a registered purebred Brahmousin bull.|$|E
5|$|The zoo {{provides}} sanctuary to {{many animals}} that {{need a place}} to live for various reasons. Some (like the Arabian oryx, Bali mynah, rhinoceros hornbill, Mexican gray wolf, and white rhinoceros) participate in captive breeding programs, some (such as the African spotted dogs) have retired from such programs and need a home, some have behavioral problems, and some are being rehabilitated to return to the wild. <b>Animals</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> in sanctuary are treated somewhat differently from other animals by the zoo.
