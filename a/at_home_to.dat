He returned on 18 September 2010 after starting in a 2–1 defeat <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> Fleetwood Town, but was substituted at half-time. Coulson made a goalscoring second comeback from his ankle injury in Grimsby's 2–2 home draw with Eastbourne Borough on 30 October 2010. For the first time as a Grimsby player he scored twice in one match in a 2–1 victory <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> AFC Wimbledon on 5 March 2011, with a first-half shot into the bottom left of the goal and a second-half shot into the top-left corner from inside the penalty area.

5|$|Arsenal's league {{campaign}} {{started on}} 9 August 1997, with an away fixture at Leeds United.

In spite of Bergkamp scoring a hat-trick against Leicester City, Arsenal drew the match 3–3, having conceded a third in the sixth minute of stoppage time. A further draw <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> rivals Tottenham Hotpsur, for whom defender Sol Campbell particularly impressed, meant Arsenal ended August in fifth position.|$|E

Bowman scored with a header from an O'Neill cross to open the scoring <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> Plymouth Argyle, {{which was the first}} goal the visitors had conceded in 500 minutes of action. However, Plymouth equalised 11 minutes later through Tope Obadeyi and the match finished a 1–1 draw. York were knocked out of the FA Cup after losing 3–2 <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> Bristol Rovers in a first round replay; the visitors were 3–0 up by 50 minutes before Fletcher pulled two back for York with a penalty and a long-range strike.|$|E
