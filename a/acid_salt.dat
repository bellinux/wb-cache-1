25|$|Less {{than half}} of the tartaric acid found in grapes is free standing, with the {{majority}} of the concentration present as potassium <b>acid</b> <b>salt.</b> During fermentation, these tartrates bind with the lees, pulp debris and precipitated tannins and pigments. While some variance among grape varieties and wine regions exists, generally about half of the deposits are soluble in the alcoholic mixture of wine. The crystallization of these tartrates can happen at unpredictable times, and in a wine bottle may appear like broken glass, though they are in fact harmless. Winemakers will often put the wine through cold stabilization, where it is exposed to temperatures below freezing to encourage the tartrates to crystallize and precipitate out of the wine, or electrodialysis which removes the tartrates via a membrane process.|$|E

60|$|When Arsenick with Soap gives a Regulus, {{and with}} Mercury {{sublimate}} a volatile fusible Salt, like Butter of Antimony, doth not this shew that Arsenick, {{which is a}} Substance totally volatile, is compounded of fix'd and volatile Parts, strongly cohering by a mutual Attraction, so that the volatile will not ascend without carrying up the fixed? And so, when an equal weight of Spirit of Wine and Oil of Vitriol are digested together, and in Distillation yield two fragrant and volatile Spirits which will not mix with one another, and a fix'd black Earth remains behind; doth not this shew that Oil of Vitriol is composed of volatile and fix'd Parts strongly united by Attraction, so as to ascend together in form of a volatile, acid, fluid Salt, until the Spirit of Wine attracts and separates the volatile Parts from the fixed? And therefore, since Oil of Sulphur per Campanam is of the same Nature with Oil of Vitriol, may it not be inferred, that Sulphur is also a mixture of volatile and fix'd Parts so strongly cohering by Attraction, as to ascend together in Sublimation. By dissolving Flowers of Sulphur in Oil of Turpentine, and distilling the Solution, {{it is found that}} Sulphur is composed of an inflamable thick Oil or fat Bitumen, an <b>acid</b> <b>Salt,</b> a very fix'd Earth, and a little Metal. The three first were found not much unequal to one another, the fourth in so small a quantity as scarce to be worth considering. The <b>acid</b> <b>Salt</b> dissolved in Water, is the same with Oil of Sulphur per Campanam, and abounding much in the Bowels of the Earth, and particularly in Markasites, unites it self to the other Ingredients of the Markasite, which are, Bitumen, Iron, Copper, and Earth, and with them compounds Allum, Vitriol, and Sulphur. With the Earth alone it compounds Allum; with the Metal alone, or Metal and Earth together, it compounds Vitriol; and with the Bitumen and Earth it compounds Sulphur. Whence it comes to pass that Markasites abound with those three Minerals. And is it not from the mutual Attraction of the Ingredients that they stick together for compounding these Minerals, and that the Bitumen carries up the other Ingredients of the Sulphur, which without it would not sublime? And the same Question may be put concerning all, or almost all the gross Bodies in Nature. For all the Parts of Animals and Vegetables are composed of Substances volatile and fix'd, fluid and solid, as appears by their Analysis; and so are Salts and Minerals, so far as Chymists have been hitherto able to examine their Composition.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{spray-drying}} process and acidic solvent system on physicochemical properties of chitosan salts were investigated. Chitosan used in spray dryings {{was obtained by}} deacetylation of chitin from lobster (Panulirus argus) origin. The chitosan <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> were prepared in a laboratory-scale spray drier, and organic acetic acid, lactic acid, and citric acid were used as solvents in the process. The physicochemical properties of chitosan salts were investigated by means of solid-state CP-MAS 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and near-infrared spectroscopy. The morphology of spray-dried chitosan <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> showed tendency toward higher sphericity when higher temperatures in a spray-drying process were applied. Analysis by XRPD indicated that all chitosan <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> studied were amorphous solids. Solid-state 13 C NMR spectra revealed {{the evidence of the}} partial conversion of chitosan acetate to chitin and also conversion to acetyl amide form which appears to be dependent on the spray-drying process. The FTIR spectra suggested that the organic acids applied in spray drying may interact with chitosan at the position of amino groups to form chitosan salts. With all three chitosan <b>acid</b> <b>salts,</b> the FTIR bands at 1, 597 and 1, 615  cm− 1 were diminished suggesting that –NH groups are protonated. The FTIR spectra of all chitosan <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> exhibited ammonium and carboxylate bands at 1, 630 and 1, 556  cm− 1, respectively. In conclusion, spray drying is a potential method of preparing <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> from chitosan obtained by deacetylation of chitin from lobster (P. argus) origin...|$|R

30|$|The most {{commonly}} used chitosan derivatives used in drug delivery are the water-soluble lobster chitosan <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> (Cervera et al. 2011). Lobster chitosan salts prepared by spray-drying have a higher tendency toward sphericity, which are good excipients for pharmaceutical applications. Moreover, lobster chitosan <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> maintain their physical, chemical, and microbiological characteristics {{for a period of}} 12  months when stored correctly at room temperature in a dry place (De la Paz et al. 2015). Apart from being stable for extended periods (1  year), the toxicity levels of lobster chitosan <b>acid</b> <b>salts</b> are negligible. This was indicated by a study investigating the single- and repeated-dose toxicity of chitosan and its salts (lactate and acetate) on rats. At oral doses of 2000  mg/kg, no fatalities or changes in the general behavior of the rats in both the acute- and repeated-dose toxicity studies were observed (Lagarto et al. 2015). This led us to a conclusion that chitosan obtained from lobster shells may be safe for use in the pharmaceutical industry.|$|R
