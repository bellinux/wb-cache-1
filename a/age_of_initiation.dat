40|$|Introduction. The {{objectives}} of this systematic review were {{to evaluate the}} evidence for different CRC screening tests and to determine the most appropriate <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> and cessation for CRC screening and the most appropriate screening intervals for selected CRC screening tests in people at average risk for CRC. Methods. Electronic databases were searched for studies that addressed the research objectives. Meta-analyses were conducted with clinically homogenous trials. A working group reviewed the evidence to develop conclusions. Results. Thirty RCTs and 29 observational studies were included. Flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) prevented CRC {{and led to the}} largest reduction in CRC mortality with a smaller but significant reduction in CRC mortality with the use of guaiac fecal occult blood tests (gFOBTs). There was insufficient or low quality evidence to support the use of other screening tests, including colonoscopy, as well as changing the <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> and cessation for CRC screening with gFOBTs in Ontario. Either annual or biennial screening using gFOBT reduces CRC-related mortality. Conclusion. The evidentiary base supports the use of FS or FOBT (either annual or biennial) to screen patients at average risk for CRC. This work will guide the development of the provincial CRC screening program...|$|R
40|$|Earlier <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> alcohol <b>initiation</b> {{have been}} {{associated}} with an increased vulnerability for Alcohol Use Disorder and general risk taking behaviors beyond genetic influence. Reward processes, including reward anticipation (pleasure before receiving alcohol/general reward), reward learning (how quickly one pairs a stimulus with alcohol/general reward), and reward consummation (pleasure when receiving alcohol/general reward), have been implicated as potential mechanisms accounting for this vulnerability. However, no careful bio-behavioral research has been conducted on the effect <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> alcohol <b>initiation</b> on general and alcohol-related reward processes. Using Event Related Potentials (ERPs), the current study addressed this gap in a sample of 123 current alcohol drinkers. The Monetary Incentive Delay-General task and Monetary Incentive Delay-Alcohol task were administered to participants, in which reward learning (quickness of pairing the neutral cue or alcohol cue with monetary feedback), reward anticipation (activity to neutral cue or alcohol cue), and reward consummation (activity to monetary feedback) were examined. Electroencephalography was used to collect ERPs that index reward anticipation (P 3) and reward consummation (P 3 and Late Positive Potential) during these tasks. Earlier <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> alcohol <b>initiation</b> were associated with increased alcohol-related reward learning and decreased alcohol-related reward consummation (P 3 and Late Positive Potential) beyond genetic and environmental covariates. There were no other significant relationships. These findings support and extend alcohol theories by showing that earlier <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> alcohol <b>initiation</b> may foster a greater sensitization in alcohol-specific reward-learning and more pronounced decreases in alcohol-related consummation. Although in need of direct testing, this might explain why earlier <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> alcohol <b>initiation</b> are associated with an increased vulnerability to Alcohol Use Disorder...|$|R
50|$|The male {{life cycle}} is {{particular}} {{tied to the}} combination of farming and herding. Boys herd from approximately eight or ten years old until the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation,</b> which occurs between fifteen and twenty years of age. After being called by the father (in consultation with the maternal uncle) to circumcision, the boys enter an age class of initiates made up of forty to sixty young men. After a celebration, the boys are circumcised in a special enclosure where they spend three months studying cosaan (a term corresponding to history, culture, etc.) by learning songs and their meaning. By {{the end of the}} period, sustained by meat feasts supplied by fathers and uncles, the initiates emerge as an age class of bachelors with their own secret song. These bachelors receive the weapons and tools of men as gifts from the father, but from this point on they farm for themselves and their uncles. The age class is bound together {{for the rest of their}} lives, helping each other to farm, fight, raid (in particular, European colonizers - see Timeline of Serer history), and marry. Married men continue farming but leave the bachelor class. The age classes gathered together males from all clans, and they were the main potential counterweight to the power of the clan leaders. Although the bachelor class formed the military class, people placed greater stress on the protecting power of the village shrines.|$|E

It was hypothesized that orphaned PWID (17 – 25 years old) were more vulnerable to smoking tobacco, cannabis, and heroin than their non-orphaned PWID counterparts. The aim of the study focused on the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> of the three substances (tobacco, cannabis, and heroin) among orphans and non-orphan PWID as well as cannabis consumption among orphans and non-orphan PWID. ^ The participants consisted of 298 (203 male and 95 female) PWID aged 17 to 25 years. A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2009 and March 2010 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Modified snowball sampling was used to recruit study participants.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between age at cigarette smoking initiation and smoking level among adolescent current smokers. Methods: In 2007, students from one or two classes of the 10 th or 11 th grade were randomly selected using the probability propor-tional to size sampling method. In total, 743 current smokers were included. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association between age at smoking initiation and smoking level as either frequent, daily, or heavy smokers. Results: The adjusted odds ratios for each smoking level were significantly higher for younger <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> smoking <b>initiation</b> than those for older <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> were (p for trend < 0. 001). Compared with the students who started smoking in grades 10 to 11, the adjust-ed odds ratios for frequent, daily, and heavy smokers increased from 2. 24 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 30 to 3. 87) to 3. 90 (95 % CI, 2. 02 to 7. 56), from 1. 56 (95 % CI, 0. 92 to 2. 62) to 3. 17 (95 % CI, 1. 70 to 5. 92), and from 2. 56 (95 % CI, 1. 21 to 5. 42) to 5. 67 (95 % CI, 2. 61 to 12. 30) with younger <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> smoking <b>initiation.</b> Conclusions: Smoking frequency and amount were closely associated with age at smoking initiation.

Participants were 3, 546 same-sex twins (mean age = 37. 7 years) from the Australian Twin Registry who completed a telephone interview that included an extensive assessment of gambling and related behaviors. Multilevel models were employed to estimate individual (within-twin-pair comparison) and family level (between-twin-pair comparison) effects, as well as the cross-level interaction between these effects.

We explored the roles of two potential causes of these trends: a temporal decline in the couples' fecundability and a postponement <b>of</b> <b>age</b> at <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy attempts. METHODS We conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation for the reproductive history of 100 000 women based on the fertility and socio-demographic characteristics of the 1968 birth cohort in France. Declines in fecundability of various amplitudes have been implemented, as well as increases in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>age</b> at <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy attempts. RESULTS A decline in fecundability by 15 % implied a decrease in fertility by 4 %, {{and an increase in}} {{the proportion of}} couples eligible for infertility treatments by 73 %.

Yet, past research on the association of <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> with later problem drinking has produced inconsistent findings. Using prospective data from the Australian Parental Supply of Alcohol Longitudinal Study cohort, this study examined age of alcohol initiation, and of first drunkenness, and associations with subsequent drinking in adolescence. A total of 1, 673 parent-child dyads recruited through Australian secondary schools completed annual surveys for 5  years (grades 7 to 11). Limiting the sample to those adolescents who had initiated alcohol use by age 17 (n =  839), multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine associations between (i) <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> to alcohol use (consuming at least 1 full serve) and (ii) age of first drunkenness, and 2 outcomes: (i) binge drinking (consuming > 4 standard drinks on a single occasion), and (ii) the total number of alcoholic drinks consumed in the past year, adjusted for a range of potential child, parent, family, and peer covariates. Fifty percent of adolescents reported alcohol use and 36 % reported bingeing at wave 5 (mean age 16. 9 years), and the mean <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> to alcohol use for drinkers was 15. 1 years. <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> was significantly associated with binge drinking and total quantity of alcohol consumed in unadjusted and adjusted models.

Results indicated that, while {{there were no significant}} gender differences in <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> to heroin use, there was a significant (p < 0. 001) time trend in the mean age at which heroin was first used. Specifically, the mean age of first heroin use among individuals born during the interval 1940 - 1949 was 20. 5 years while among those born during 1970 - 1979 the mean age of first heroin use was 16. 5 years. These findings were confirmed by analyses of the National Household Survey. Further analysis of the ASHIDU data indicated that younger <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> to heroin use was associated with polydrug use, overdose and crime after the effects of duration of heroin use had been statistically controlled. These findings suggest that there has been both an increase in the willingness of young people to experiment with heroin and an increased availability of the drug over this time. In combination with evidence that there has been an increase in the amount of heroin being imported into Australia, and an increased demand for treatment for opiate dependence, these data suggest that Australia is experiencing an increase in the use of heroin, particularly among youth...|$|E

Data {{were taken from the}} 1998 National Drug Strategy Household Survey, which was a representative sample of Australians aged 14 years and over. Nine five-year cohorts were examined in persons born between 1940 and 1984...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{series of}} three {{experiments}} was conducted to determine {{the role of the}} yolk sac in <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> growth in broilers. In Experiment 1, absorption of the yolk sac was found to precede <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> growth in newly hatched broilers by approximately 24 h. Because the yolk sac is essential for early <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> growth, in Experiments 2 and 3 it was removed and diets with incremental fat levels of 3, 6, and 10 % were fed to assess whether fat was essential for optimal growth during the neonatal period. Results suggest that dietary fat has its greatest effect on growth after 10 days <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> Therefore, <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> growth may be more closely dependent upon other nutrients...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the management of}} an HIV-infected infant with multisystem disease. The infant presented with severe disease at 3 months <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> <b>Initiation</b> <b>of</b> antiretroviral therapy (ART) was delayed through initial lack of access, after which she developed immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome to BCG. At this time she was also infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with a later recurrence due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB). During this episode she presented with acute cor pulmonale, possibly due to a pulmonary embolus and also transaminitis. Although such infants are seen frequently in sub-Saharan Africa, there are few guidelines or case descriptions to assist clinicians. Articl...|$|R
40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study aimed at identifying predictors {{of sexual behavior}} with multiple partners {{in a sample of}} 423 higher-education students took place at Hermosillo city, Northwest of Mexico. For data processing, the T-test, the Mann-Whitney U-test, the Pearson's (r) correlation coefficient, as well as a multiple regression analysis were used in consecutive order. Regression analysis by gender showed that biological <b>age,</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>initiation,</b> and a social situation -Finding myself in a place for adults- were predictors of the behavior in men, thus explaining 42. 4 % of the total variance. On the other hand, predictors of this behavior in women were biological <b>age,</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>initiation,</b> and one type of biological state -I was physically excited-, with these variables explaining 70. 3 % of the total variance. The results of this study contribute with valuable information to identifying the variables that facilitate both in men and women the practice of having multiple partners when performing sexual behavior, an aspect that must be considered at the time of designing and implementing HIV prevention programs in this population secto...|$|R
