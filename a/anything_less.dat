5|$|Both Sherman and McKinley {{sought a}} {{peaceful}} resolution to the Cuban War, preferably involving an independent Cuba without American intervention. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but {{it became clear that}} Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never settle for <b>anything</b> <b>less.</b> In January 1898, Spain promised some concessions to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed.|$|E
5|$|The first {{station was}} a {{temporary}} terminus for the GWR {{on the west}} side of Bishop's Bridge Road, opened on 4 June 1838. The first GWR service from London to Taplow, near Maidenhead, ran from Paddington in 1838. After the main station opened, this became the site of the goods depot. Brunel did not consider that <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> than a grand terminus dedicated to the GWR would be acceptable, and consequently this was approved in February 1853.|$|E
5|$|For decades, {{rebels in}} Cuba had waged an {{intermittent}} campaign for freedom from Spanish colonial rule. By 1895, the conflict had expanded {{to a war}} for Cuban independence. As war engulfed the island, Spanish reprisals against the rebels grew ever harsher. American public opinion favored the rebels, and McKinley shared in their outrage against Spanish policies. However while public opinion called for war to liberate Cuba, McKinley favored a peaceful approach, hoping that through negotiation, Spain might be convinced to grant Cuba independence, {{or at least to}} allow the Cubans some measure of autonomy. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but it became clear that Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never settle for <b>anything</b> <b>less.</b>|$|E

5|$|Going {{into the}} final round of games, both teams were equal on points with Spain, with Scotland ahead thanks to a {{superior}} goal difference; however, Spain's final game at home to Iceland was scheduled to be played two weeks after Wales and Scotland had played each other. With this in mind, a draw for Scotland would be sufficient to virtually guarantee second place in Group 7 and advance at the very least through to the two legged play-off against the winner of the Oceania qualifying tournament, while a win would likely see them top the group and qualify automatically. For Wales, <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> than a win would virtually end their hopes of qualification.|$|E
5|$|MacGregor was {{introduced}} to Maria Bowater, {{the daughter of a}} Royal Navy admiral, around 1804. Maria commanded a substantial dowry and, apart from her by-now-deceased father, was related to two generals, a member of parliament and the botanist Aylmer Bourke Lambert. Gregor and Maria married at St Margaret's Church, Westminster in June 1805 and set up home in London, at the residence of the bride's aunt. Two months later, having rejoined the 57th Foot in Gibraltar, MacGregor bought the rank of captain for about £900, choosing not to wait the seven years such a promotion might take without purchase. The 57th Foot remained in Gibraltar between 1805 and 1809. During this time MacGregor developed an obsession with dress, rank insignia and medals that made him unpopular in the regiment; he forbade any enlisted man or non-commissioned officer to leave his quarters in <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> than full dress uniform.|$|E
5|$|Von der Tann {{also participated}} in the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, on 15–16December. The raid was another attempt to lure out {{a portion of the}} Grand Fleet and destroy it, with the whole of the High Seas Fleet {{standing}} by in support. Von der Tann delayed the raid itself by several days, because Admiral Ingenohl was unwilling to send forth the IScouting Group at <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> than full strength, and Von der Tann was undergoing routine repairs in early December. The I Scouting Group, along with the II Scouting Group, composed of the four light cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, and Graudenz, and two torpedo boat flotillas, left the Jade at 03:20. Hipper's ships sailed north, through the channels in the minefields, past Heligoland to the Horns Reef light vessel, at which point the ships turned westward, towards the English coast. The main battle squadrons of the High Seas Fleet left in the late afternoon of the 15th. During the night of 15 December, {{the main body of the}} High Seas Fleet encountered British destroyers, and fearing the prospect of a night-time torpedo attack, Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat.|$|E

Justice is not achieved, however, if persons are convicted on <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> than the requisite standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

25|$|Meanwhile, the Siamese {{leadership}} {{had grown}} desperate. The king and princes {{tried to escape}} the city but were driven back. The king finally offered to become a Burmese tributary but the Burmese, who had just received the king's order to persevere, would not accept <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> than an unconditional surrender.

Also it accepted me as a god without question and gave us all the food we needed. Moreover, when we left their land men were provided to carry the litters and the loads.|$|R

25|$|The {{prevalence}} of salarymen in Japanese society has {{given birth to}} many depictions by both the Japanese and American media. Some films in Japan about salarymen include Mr. Salaryman, Japanese Salaryman NEO (based on the TV series), and a drama series entitled History of a Salaryman. There is a certain expectation among {{the middle and upper}} classes for Japanese men to become salarymen. For many young Japanese men, accepting <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> than becoming a salaryman and conforming to its ideal is considered a failure, not only of him, but of his parents.|$|E
25|$|The Boise State Broncos, who {{returned}} more starters from 2005 {{than any other}} team in NCAA Division I-A football, began the year with high hopes; according to one major source, <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> than a BCS Bowl berth {{would have been a}} disappointment. First-year head coach Chris Petersen led this perennially strong non-BCS conference school to an undefeated 12–0 record. Some of the Broncos key wins this season came over Oregon State of the Pac-10 Conference, Hawaii and Fresno State. Boise State was the champion of the Western Athletic Conference.|$|E

On 5 March 1939 the Republican army, led by the Colonel Segismundo Casado and the politician Julián Besteiro, rose against the prime minister Juan Negrín and formed the National Defence Council (Consejo Nacional de Defensa or CND) to negotiate a peace deal. Negrín fled to France on 6 March, but the Communist troops around Madrid rose against the junta, starting a brief civil war within the civil war. Casado defeated them, and began peace negotiations with the Nationalists, but Franco refused to accept <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> than unconditional surrender.|$|E

He also pressed for an increase in pensions payable to the disabled, saying that <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> than 90s. per week would be regarded as an instalment by the Royal British Legion in Northern Ireland. In the 1955 budget, he put down an amendment to exempt vehicles used by limbless ex-servicemen from purchase tax.|$|E
25|$|Income {{taxation}} has {{the worst}} effect on {{division of labor}} {{in the form of}} barter. Suppose that the person doing job B is actually interested in having job A done for him. Now suppose you could amazingly do job A four times over, selling half your work on the market for cash just to pay your tax bill. The other half of the work you do for somebody who does job B twice over but he has to sell off half to pay his tax bill. You're left with one unit of job B, but only if you were 400% as productive doing job A! In this case of 50% tax on barter income, <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> than 400% productivity will cause the division of labor to fail.|$|E
25|$|In 1866, {{following}} the Battle of Sadova and the Austrian {{defeat in the}} Austro-Prussian War, the Austro-Hungarian empire began to experience increased internal problems. In an effort to shore up support for the monarchy, Emperor Franz Joseph began negotiations for a compromise with the Magyar nobility to ensure their support. Some members of the government, such as the Austro-Hungarian prime minister Count Belcredi, advised the Emperor to make a more comprehensive constitutional deal {{with all of the}} nationalities that would have created a federal structure. Belcredi worried that an accommodation with the Magyar interests would alienate the other nationalities. However, Franz Joseph was unable to ignore the power of the Magyar nobility, and they would not accept <b>anything</b> <b>less</b> than dualism between themselves and the traditional Austrian élites.|$|E

His only autobiographical writing concerning this period is Herald of Coming Good, a work, if <b>anything,</b> even <b>less</b> reliable than Meetings. In it, he mentions acting as hypnotherapist specialising in the cure of addictions and using people as guinea pigs for his methods. It is also speculated that during his travels, he was engaged in a certain amount of political activity, as part of The Great Game.|$|R
