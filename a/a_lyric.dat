5|$|Fauré's {{works of}} {{the last years of}} the century include {{incidental}} music for the English premiere of Maurice Maeterlinck's Pelléas et Mélisande (1898) and Prométhée, <b>a</b> <b>lyric</b> tragedy composed for the amphitheatre at Béziers. Written for outdoor performance, the work is scored for huge instrumental and vocal forces. Its premiere in August 1900 was a great success, and it was revived at Béziers the following year and in Paris in 1907. A version with orchestration for normal opera house-sized forces was given at the Paris Opéra in May 1917 and received more than forty performances in Paris thereafter. From 1903 to 1921, Fauré regularly wrote music criticism for Le Figaro, a role in which he was not at ease. Nectoux writes that Fauré's natural kindness and broad-mindedness predisposed him to emphasise the positive aspects of a work.|$|E

5|$|The second {{version was}} <b>a</b> <b>lyric</b> video, which {{features}} Hamasaki in a recording studio. It also features candid photos of Hamasaki in Los Angeles, Japan, and doing other endeavours outside of music. The Riff Studio version features Hamasaki as her character design AyuPan and a character titled the Bloody Bunny. Both {{of them are}} in a space ship, and travel throughout different worlds and atmospheres, until landing on a planet with blue aliens. The aliens appear to be sad, whist AyuPan and the Bloody Bunny stand there. AyuPan then plays the song from her space ship, and makes the aliens feel happy; they all begin dancing to the track. It ends with the world turning pink instead of blue, and has heart shapes around it. This version premiered one week before the album's release in July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E
5|$|Three {{music videos}} were shot for the single; one by Yusuke Azumaya, the second being <b>a</b> <b>lyric</b> video, {{and the third}} {{directed}} and animated by Riff Studios. Azumaya's version opens with a large-figured woman cutting images of herself and sticking them on portraits of a blonde male. As she sticks it on her wall, she begins a quest to lose weight for {{the man in the}} photo, and starts running and exercising in Los Angeles, California. Throughout the entire video, it has the woman running to different locations and trying different workouts with the public, whilst small animations of her exercising are added into small parts. Near the end of the video, the girl decides to get a makeover, whilst a stylist dresses her in a pink dress. She runs towards the man in a park, though he is disinterested and walks away. A man holding a balloon bumps into the woman, and as the camera pans away to the balloons floating towards the sky, the woman turns into Hamasaki. The man who walked away from the woman then see's Hamasaki, walks to her, and both hug each other.|$|E
25|$|As one of {{the main}} subgenres, Verse-Narrative gets the least {{attention}} because it so effortlessly overlaps the other subgenres. It does not necessarily have the components of an Epic, nor the lyricism and shifting scope of <b>a</b> <b>Lyric</b> Sequence or <b>a</b> <b>Lyric</b> Series, nor the close relation to narrative of Verse Novel. It exists for critics generally as an accepted part of the long poem Tradition.|$|E

25|$|Description: <b>A</b> <b>lyric</b> soprano's {{instrument}} {{in a lower}} range; the resulting sound is less piercing, more lachrymose and rather sensitive. The voices are similar, giving rise to the term 'short soprano' i.e. a soprano without the highest notes. In fact, many lyric mezzos with strong extensions to their upper vocal registers {{make the transition to}} singing as sopranos {{at some point in their}} careers.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>lyric</b> {{sequence}} {{is a collection}} of shorter lyric poems that interact to create a coherent, larger meaning. The lyric sequence often includes poems unified by a theme. A defining characteristic of this subgenre is that each lyric enhances the meaning of the other lyrics in the work, creating an enhanced collective metaphor, that opens the lyric sequence to unique adaptations of dialogue and other narrative/theatrical characteristics.|$|E

25|$|The single {{release was}} {{promoted}} with an Instagram-based campaign, <b>a</b> <b>lyric</b> video directed by Aya Tanimura and live performances—one of the latter, at the American Music Awards of 2013, {{was the center}} of controversy due to accusations of cultural appropriation and racism. Brent Benacorso served as the director for the track's music video, which adopts the theme of love and uses a series of metaphors to enrich its concept.|$|E
25|$|Velasquez {{possesses}} a four-octave vocal range. Classified as <b>a</b> <b>lyric</b> coloratura soprano, Velasquez {{is famous for}} her effortless and exceptional sustained belting while doing her vocal acrobatics in the key of her highest pitch. She has exhibited her belting and sheer lung power while singing onstage sitting in lotus position, while lying on bed and even while being suspended up on a harness in mid-air. Velasquez credits this from her father's vocal training technique where she is submerged neck-deep in the sea to strengthen her diaphragm and build up her vocal cords and lung power.|$|E
25|$|Ackerson was {{not worried}} with the album being perfect; for example, when Pierre forgot to record <b>a</b> <b>lyric</b> at the studio, he {{recorded}} {{it on his}} computer {{and sent it to}} Ackerson, who simply added reverb and mixed it into the recording. The band at the time considered their work on Go a step further than anything they had done prior, which included hiring a live string ensemble to perform. The band finished 16–17 songs, using 11 for the album and the remainder for B-sides and bonus tracks.|$|E
