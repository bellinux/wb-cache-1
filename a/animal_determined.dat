40|$|It is {{believed}} that many <b>animals</b> <b>determine</b> {{the direction of a}} low frequency sound by comparing the times at which the sound arrives at its ears. Some years ago Jeffress proposed that this is accomplished by a network of coincidence detection neurons together with a system of delay line-like axons connecting these neurons to the two ears. There is substantial experimental evidence in favor of many aspects of this model, although some recent experiments, particularly in mammals, seem to be at odds with certain aspects of the Jeffress picture. We point out that from an engineering standpoint the original Jeffress approach to coincidence detection is not a very efficient way to accomplish sound localization. Recent experiments which seem difficult to reconcile with the Jeffress picture, might be understood in terms of a different coincidence detection scheme. 1 I.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{clinical}} significance of antibodies directed against antigens other than {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) antigens is poorly understood, and there are few large animal models in which such antibodies can be examined. We studied, both retrospectively and prospectively, the development of antibodies to non-MHC antigens in tolerant miniature swine. METHODS: Our database was assessed for cases of antidonor antibody formation in tolerant animals over the last 20 years. Flow cytometry, absorption assays, and familial analyses for inheritance pattern of the gene(s) potentially responsible for the antibody reactivities were carried out, and an <b>animal</b> <b>determined</b> to be negative for this reactivity was immunized by a skin graft and subcutaneous injections of peripheral blood monocyte cells from an antigen-positive donor. RESULTS: Sixteen of 469 tolerant animals tested {{were found to have}} developed antidonor antibodies. These antibodies were found to be specific for the same, presumably single, non-MHC antigen. Familial analyses indicated that the gene encoding this antigen was expressed in an autosomal-dominant manner in approximately 95 % of the herd. In a prospective study, antidonor antibodies with the same specificity as those observed retrospectively were successfully induced in an antigen-negative animal after immunization with peripheral blood monocyte cells. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of the development of antibodies to a highly prevalent, non-MHC antigen present on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and developing in tolerant animals without signs of graft dysfunction. Considering the concern often raised by the appearance of antidonor antibodies in transplant recipients, these data could have important implications for clinical transplantation...|$|E
40|$|Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) is the causative {{agent of}} bovine tuberculosis, a global disease that in Argentina affects {{approximately}} 5 % of cattle, particularly dairy cattle. Several genotyping methods that distinguish between different isolates of M. bovis have been reported. Among them, {{the most convenient}} are spoligotyping (a reverse line probe assay) and genotyping by Variable Number of Tandem Repeat (VNTR). In Argentina, unlike what happens in {{other countries in the}} region, there is a highly predominant spoligotype (SB 0140), but the reason for this dominance is still unknown. In five countries of Latin America, a total of 244 different spoligotypes were found: 8. 4 % of isolates had orphan spoligotypes, whereas 91. 6 % formed clusters. Only 1 spoligotype was common to Argentina Brazil and Chile. However, there were 10 spoligotypes shared between Argentina and Brazil; 2 between Argentina and Chile; and 1 between Chile and Brazil. In conclusion, despite the diversity of spoligotypes found in the five countries, there are major patterns predominating in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. These clusters may reflect a long-lasting active transmission of bovine tuberculosis. The other goal {{of this study was to}} investigate whether there are M. bovis genotypes with differential virulence properties. While this is a topic already elucidated for other pathogenic bacteria, the properties for M. bovis are still unknown. First, the virulence of M. bovis isolates were tested in a mice model of progressive disease. Balb/c mice infected with the M. bovis reference strain AN 5 showed a 50 % survival after four months of infection, with a moderate number of lung bacillary counts. Two weeks after inoculation, it induced a strong inflammatory response with numerous granulomas and progressive pneumonia. In turn, the strain M. bovis 04 - 303, isolated from a wild boar, was the most lethal, and its most striking feature was sudden pneumonia development with extensive necrosis. Strain 04 - 302 induced a similar pathology, although to a lesser extent. In contrast, strains 534, V 2 (both from cattle) and 02 - 2 B (from humans) were less virulent, permitting higher survival after four months of infection, Thus, as reported with Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates, M. bovis also showed virulence variability. This variability can be attributed to the induction of different immune response profiles. The virulence of the most virulent strain was also evaluated in guinea pigs and cattle showing the same results. On the other hand, the genome of this strain was sequenced showing that the genome encodes for 3988 protein and 49 RNA genes. Some particularities of the genome sequence and a deduced proteome will be shown. A methodology was designed to establish whether a relationship exists between the genotype of M. bovis and the degree of pathogenicity it causes in cattle. The essence of this methodology is to establish a correlation between the genotype of M. bovis, the degree of progression of tuberculosis and animal age. To this aim, three correlates were used: (1) The genotype was based on the spoligotype; (2) The degree of bovine tuberculosis lesions were quantified with a score based on clinical observations in slaughterhouses, such as the number and location of granulomas, and the histopathologic features; and (3) These data were stratified by the approximated age of the <b>animal,</b> <b>determined</b> by the category (calf, steer, heifer, etc). Thus, the virulence was studied in infected cattle, and not in laboratory animals, through a detailed analysis of the lesions found in the slaughterhouses. The lesions were processed for histopathology and culture. As a control for genetic uniformity, the alleles of BoLA DRB 3 were sequenced. Lineages with the highest pathogenicity scores were of low abundance and were found in the south of Cordoba province...|$|E

However, these technologies have been reached less than 60 % degradation/conversion of organic matter to methane. In comparison, over millions of years, living organisms have explored and optimized the digestion {{of a wide variety of}} substrates with high yields (> 70 %). The aim of the study is the analysis of natural innovation in animal digestive tracts in order to improve anaerobic digestion processes. The approach consists of a large descriptive inventory of animal digestive tracts. Animals (vertebrates, arthropods, molluscs, etc.) use all types of organic matter as food. Moreover over evolutionary time, organisms become more and more specialized and use only specific type of food (leaves, seed, meat, bones, faeces, etc.). In parallel, the digestive systems evolve to optimize the nutrient recovery. Each animal species domesticates its own microbe consortium and develops its own digestive tract structure. The digestive systems can be seen as a microbial reactor with abiotic pre- and/or post-treatments. When considering their functions, physiological compartments can be imagined as reactors. Thus, continuous stirred-tank reactors, continuous stirred-tank reactors in series, plug-flow reactors, and batch reactors can be used to model the function of these compartments. In this paper, we relate animal size, animal phylogeny and the feeding habit (carnivorous, omnivorous, granivorous, herbivorous) to the type and the position of microbial compartment with respect to the abiotic compartments within the digestive tract. We also relate the role of these parameters on the microbial diversity within the microbial compartment. The results show that (i) the feeding habit determines the type of microbial reactor and its position within the digestive tract; (ii) the phylogeny of the <b>animal</b> <b>determines</b> the type of abiotic pre- and/or post-treatment; (iii) finally, the size of the <b>animal</b> <b>determines</b> the level of diversity of the microbial communities...|$|R
