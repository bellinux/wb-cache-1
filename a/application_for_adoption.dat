For years, professionals and prospective adoptive applicants have heard the adage, "adopt a child and you will become pregnant: ' The tendency, how-ever, has been for professionals to dismiss the possibility of pregnancy as just another folk belief without looking at the factors that have kept this saying alive. The staff of Hope Cottage, a multi-service children's agency located in Dallas and funded by United Way, be-came interested in exploring the issue further when an unexpectedly high percentage of couples achieved pregnancy after applying to adopt a child. Staff were vaguely aware that pregnancies had occurred among cou-ples being studied, potential adoptive parents awaiting placement of a child, and those having had a child placed in their home. However, it seemed that never before had such a con-centration of pregnancies occurred as in a group of 137 couples accepted for study as prospective parents when <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>adoption</b> of infants was opened in April 1978. This situ-ation led staff to explore the possi-bility of a relationship between adop-tion and pregnancy and to address the following questions: Does some-thing in the adoptive process make pregnancy possible for some couples who have had a history of infertil-ity? Are some diagnoses of infertil-ity more amenable to psychophysio-logical modifications in the couple? Do some intrapsychic changes that enable a couple to achieve a long-sought pregnancy occur during the adoptive process?

40|$|The {{researcher}} undertook {{this investigation}} of inter-institutional collaboration in the New Zealand tertiary education sector to identify common aspects of management activity that could {{form the basis}} of best practice guidelines for adoption by sector leadership. A qualitative approach was undertaken, set within a social constructivist paradigm, with grounded theory utilised {{as the basis for the}} theoretical framework and research methodology. A literature review was conducted prior to data collection and updated following the preparation of the first draft thesis. Data was collected via semi-structured open interviews with 17 tertiary education sector leaders. The population sample total was 28 vice-chancellors and chief executives. In-depth interviews were conducted providing a rich and deep information base. The researcher recognises that the generalisability of the associated findings is potentially somewhat limited. From the iterative data collection and analysis processes, shared benefit and strong relationships emerged as the most significant basis for tertiary education institutions to consider collaborating. These factors were considered to be more important than other perceived enablers such as geographical proximity or similarity in institution type or size. The study also identified that collaboration is generally considered to be a positive activity, however it is challenging and resource-intensive to initiate and implement. Research participants suggested that there is no one generic model that can guarantee collaborative success, however there are a number of factors leaders can consider at the preparatory phase to maximise the effectiveness of the planned activity. The research has provided a basis to create best practice managerial guidelines for adoption by New Zealand tertiary education sector institution leaders to assist their institutions when undertaking collaborative activity. There is possible generic <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>adoption</b> by other sectors and to tertiary education institutions in other countries; these are both areas for possible further research...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the final}} Report of the present Board whose term of office {{finishes}} on the 29 th January, 1998. The Board received 108 <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> domestic <b>adoption</b> orders in respect of children placed by Registered Adoption Societies and Health Boards in 1997 compared to 152 <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt a child from overseas under Section 5 (1) (iii) (II) of the Adoption Act, 1991. In total the Board received 431 <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>adoption</b> of Irish children of will be 269 were in respect of family adoptions. The Board made 422 Irish adoption orders and recognised 148 foreign adoption orders. In the five years of its existence this Board has witnessed dramatic changes in adoption practice and trends, changes which are reflective of the rapid pace of developments in Irish social life over the period. Despite these changes the Board is obliged to continue to operate within a legislative framework which is ill-equipped to cater <b>for</b> current <b>adoption</b> needs. The Board is still largely operating under a system devised in 1952. Arising out of this there are short falls and inconsistencies in the system which should be urgently addressed {{by the introduction of}} modern consolidated legislation. The Board calls for the modernisation of adoption legislation and an amalgamation of the adoption code. It notes that current law consists of six separate pieces of legislation and that the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996 which was withdrawn from the Seanad would have brought the total to seven separate pieces of legislation. The Board considers that there is an urgent need to consolidate the adoption code into one comprehensive piece of legislation to bring adoption law into the 21 st century. The Board notes the changing nature of the domestic adoption scene with the trend towards a more unified adoption service being provided by the Health Boards and less involvement from the Registered Adoption Societies. During 1996 St Brigid's Adoption Society was deregistered and St Patrick's Guild Adoption Society and the Rotunda Girls Aid Society made a decision to cease to place children <b>for</b> <b>adoption.</b> However, all three societies continue to provide a tracing service for their clients.

40|$|If {{a parent}} marries {{someone who is}} not the other natural parent of his child the couple may wish to adopt the child. Adoption makes the child a full member of the new family and destroys the legal {{relationship}} with his family of birth. In 1974, the Departmental Committee on the Adoption of Children (the Houghton Committee) recommended that adoption was not an appropriate way to re-organize relationships within step-families. Subsection 10 (3) of the Children Act 1975 which was implemented on 26 November 1976 restricts step-parent adoption in cases where the child's natural parents have been divorced. Courts hearing such applications are required to dismiss them if the matter would be better dealt with by a joint custody order in favour of the parent and step-parent.

The corresponding figure for 1995 was 143 <b>applications.</b> <b>Applications</b> <b>for</b> children being adopted within their natural family decreased from 274 in 1995 to 241 in 1996. The Board made 405 adoption orders in 1996 compared with 490 in 1995. Family <b>adoptions</b> accounted <b>for</b> 243 orders, of which 230 were made in favour of the child's birth mother and her husband. There were 141 orders made in respect of health board and registered adoption society placements. The Board made seven adoption orders under the Adoption Act, 1988. Further information on applications under this Act is given on page 9 of this report. In 1996 the Board made two <b>adoption</b> orders <b>for</b> Irish children with special needs. Whereas there is a large {{decrease in the number of}} children being adopted in Ireland the interest in overseas adoption continues to grow. During 1996 the Board recognised 117 foreign adoptions under the terms of the Adoption Act, 1991. To date the Board has recognised 696 foreign adoptions. In 1996, the Board made 117 declarations of suitability and eligibility under Section 5 of the Act. It also extended the declarations of suitability and eligibility of 32 couples who had not effected the adoption of a foreign child during the existence of their original declaration. In 1996 the Board considered over 700 enquiries from adoptees, birth mothers and siblings seeking access to their birth records or contact. The Board noted an increase in the number of adoptees requesting a copy of their original birth certificate. Some want access to their birth certificate to assist them in tracing their birth parents while others merely wish to have a copy of their original birth certificate. The Board is aware that some people are making their own enquiries in the absence of appropriate professional counselling and that in some instances the wrong people have been contacted. This has obviously caused unnecessary stress to those tracing and to those who were contacted. The Board notes that in most jurisdictions there is automatic access to birth records for adoptees over eighteen years of age and requests that consideration be given to bringing in the necessary legislation to govern this issue. It considers that there should be a right of access to these records but that some form of mandatory counselling should be availed of before the release of any birth certificate. The Board has submitted proposals to the Department of Health on the matter. During 1996 the Board continued to receive an increasing number of enquiries from people wishing to trace their birth mothers and from birth mothers wishing to contact their children. Agencies and adoption societies reported an increased demand for a comprehensive tracing service during the year. The Board has been calling for the establishment of a National Contact Register for the last numbers of years. It has had detailed discussions with the statutory and the non-statutory agencies involved in adoption work concerning the establishment of a Register. The Board has also had discussions with Mr Austin Currie T.

Similar to private law, treaty designers face a trade-off between flexibility to adjust to unforeseen contingencies and the danger that the binding nature of the treaty and hence, the level of commitment by treaty members, is being undermined if the treaty can be amended too easily. In this paper, we address this problem in the analytical framework of institutional economics, drawing in particular on the incomplete contracts literature. Furthermore, we derive preliminary hypotheses and operational concepts for the measurement of flexibility in international treaties. Based on 400 treaties and supplementary agreements from the field of international environmental law, we provide new insights into the combined <b>application</b> of rules <b>for</b> <b>adoption</b> and entry into force of amendments, as well as provisions for conflict resolution and interpretative development.
