Therefore, a fair allocation of intergovernmental grants is essential for financing vital local services like education and healthcare.

Recently, Tanzania replaced the previously existing discretionary method of grant <b>allocation</b> by <b>allocation</b> <b>formulas.</b> We study whether this has reduced the effect of malapportionment on grant allocation.

40|$|In an era {{of fiscal}} stress for many local governments in the United States, {{intergovernmental}} cooperation has become a focus for cost savings. Cooperation and consolidation is a recognition that existing boundaries and service delivery mechanism simply are too inefficient and burdensome for a community to maintain. City and county officials face a basic tradeoff in assessing the merits of cooperation involving the desire of many citizens for sovereignty and local decision making authority versus the potential cost savings associated with the economies of scale of larger government units. As intergovernmental agreements are negotiated, the issue of cost allocation among various parties often becomes a major issue. Some cost <b>allocation</b> <b>formulas</b> emphasize ease of implementation, while potentially shifting the burden onto one or another party. Complicated cost <b>allocation</b> <b>formulas</b> may reduce burden sharing or donor situations, but at greater cost of implementation and maintenance. A simple economic model is presented in this analysis to highlight the distributional consequences of various cost allocation strategies among parties to intergovernmental agreements...|$|R

The higher the district magnitude, the more proportional an electoral system becomes - the most proportional being {{when there is no}} division into constituencies at all and the entire country is treated as a single constituency. More, in some countries the electoral system works on two levels: at-large for parties, and in constituencies for candidates, with local party-lists seen as fractions of general, national lists. In this case, magnitude of local constituencies is irrelevant, seat apportionment being calculated at national level.|$|E

50|$|Despite oil's {{prominent}} role in national affairs, up to this time, the Nigerian federal government had only limited involvement {{in the oil industry}}, and the government confined its financial involvement in the oil industry to taxes and royalties on the oil companies. The companies were subsequently able to set their own price on the petroleum they extracted, and dominated petroleum to such a point that laws governing the oil sector were having a negative effect on Nigerian interests. However, even during the conflict with Biafra would force changes to the relationship between federal government and the petroleum industry. Gowon's military government instituted the 1969 Petroleum Decree which dismantled the existing revenue allocation system that had divided revenue from oil taxes equally between federal and state government, instead favouring an <b>allocation</b> <b>formula</b> in which the federal government controlled the dispensation of revenues to the states.|$|E

50|$|All {{proposals}} eliminate {{profit shifting}} {{by means of}} transfer pricing or financing. Basically, formula apportionment works like a tax on each factor included in the formula. Since the Commission {{does not want to}} question the Member States' right to set the tax rate, there is still room for tax competition via the tax rates. Due to the common tax base across the EU, it is no longer possible for Member States to compensate high-tax rates with a narrow tax base or vice versa. The Member States compete rather for real investments than for tax bases. The Commission's proposal of a CCCTB could be {{a solution to the problem}} of international corporate tax planning within the EU. In particular, the CCCTB eliminates the incentive to shift profits to low-tax countries via transfer pricing or financing. However, there is still room for tax competition between Member States as long as the tax rates are not harmonised within the EU. Moreover, the existing problems of the arm's length principle continue to exist with respect to third countries. Effectively, the CCCTB introduces a new system of formula apportionment in addition to the system of arm's length. Thus, at present, the introduction of the CCCTB does not seem realistic on a political level, because the harmonisation requirements are high: a common tax base, a European profit <b>allocation</b> <b>formula</b> and common consolidation and anti-abuse rules would have to be introduced.|$|E
