There is {{an ongoing}} {{controversy}} regarding {{how to take care}} of patients with mild primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and how to grade their disease activity in terms of bone parameters. This prospective and randomized study was undertaken to evaluate skeletal effects of delayed surgical treatment in such patients. Methods. Fifty patients with mild PHPT (serum calcium, 2. 55 to 2. 95 mmol/L, 10. 2 to 11. 8 mg/dL) were randomized to parathyroidectomy either at diagnosis or 1 year later. Hip and spine bone mineral density (BMD, determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), bone <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> <b>in</b> <b>serum,</b> osteocalcin and P-CrossLaps in plasma, and calcium in urine were measured in all patients at inclusion in the study and 1 and 2 years later.

Parathyroidectomy decreased all biochemical bone markers (P <. 0001) and increased lumbar spine BAW (P <. 05) equally in both groups, even in patients without overt osteoporosis, whereas hip BAM was increased (P <. 05) in the early intervention group only. Conclusion. Prolonged exposure to mild and seemingly stable PHPT is a risk factor for hip fractures, which adds to other reasons for surgical treatment of this condition without delay regardless of serum calcium levels...|$|E

The results from this study show that there was a statistically significant increase of lipid peroxidase. The result from the investigation of liver lipid peroxidase activities showed that there was an increase in lipid peroxidase activity (5. 88 ± 1. 45 *) when compared with that of the control (5. 04 ± 0. 82). The results from the study of <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> activities revealed that the activities level of serum ALP of group B (15. 90 ± 1. 6) showed a significant decrease at (P< 0. 05) when compared with that of the control A (18. 38 ± 3. 9) (Table 2).

40|$|Summary: Bone metastases {{in cancer}} of the {{prostate}} are diagnosed routinely by isotope bone scintigraphy and the measurement of <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> <b>in</b> <b>serum</b> and the calcium excretion in urine. The specificity of these examina-tions is in general not satisfactory. We therefore investigated the diagnostic value of five new markers of bone formation and bone resorption {{for the detection of}} the metastatic process. In a group of 43 patients with carcinoma of the prostate the carboxyterminal propeptide, the carboxyterminal cross-linked telopeptide, the aminoterminal cross-linked telopeptide, and the deoxypyridinoline cross-links of type 1 collagen were measured as well as the specific bone alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme. A group of 34 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia served as a control. A receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed. It appeared that the sensitivity of carboxyter-minal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen was the greatest (89 %), while the best specificity was obtained for the deoxypyridinoline cross-links assay (92 %). The diagnostic values of the new markers were generally comparable with those of alkaline phosphatase although carboxyterminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen yielded better results, but those with carboxyterminal propeptide of type I procollagen were less satisfactory.

40|$|Objective(s) : Long term {{consumption}} of ethanol may induce damage to many organs. Ethanol induces its noxious effects through {{reactive oxygen species}} production, and lipid peroxidation and apoptosis induction in different tissues and cell types. Previous experiments have indicated the antioxidant characteristics of thymoquinone, the active constituent of Nigella sativa fixed oil, against biologically dangerous reactive oxygen species. This experiment was planned to evaluate the protective effect of thymoquinone against subchronic ethanol toxicity in rats. Materials and Methods: Experiments were performed on six groups. Each group consisted of six animals, including control group (saline, gavage), ethanol-receiving group (3 g/kg/day, gavage), thymoquinone (2. 5, 5, 10 mg/Kg/day, intraperitoneally (IP)) plus ethanol and thymoquinone (10 mg/Kg/day, IP) groups. Treatments were carried out in four weeks. Results: Thymoquinone reduced the ethanol-induced increase in the lipid peroxidation and severity of histopathological alteration in liver and kidney tissues. In addition it improved the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in liver tissue. Furthermore, thymoquinone corrected the liver enzymes level including alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> <b>in</b> <b>serum</b> and glutathione content in liver and kidney tissues. Other experiments such as Western blot analysis and quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that thymoquinone suppressed the expression of Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio (both protein and mRNA level), and caspases activation pursuant to ethanol toxicity.

40|$|Bile duct {{ligation}} {{causes a}} five- to sevenfold {{increase in the}} activity of rat liver alkaline phosphatase within 12 hours after ligation and a similar rise in the activity of <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> <b>in</b> <b>serum.</b> The increased serum activity is due entirely to {{the appearance of a}} new isoenzyme that has the properties of rat liver alkaline phosphatase. The increase in both serum and liver alkaline phosphatase is prevented by the prior administration of cycloheximide in a dose that inhibits protein synthesis by 70 %. Rat liver alkaline phosphatase was then purified to homogeneity. Antibody was raised to purified rat liver alkaline phosphatase in rabbits. The antibody was coupled to sepharose 4 B and affinity columns made. 3 -H-leucine was then injected into the portal veins of sham operated rats and rats with bile duct ligation four hours after ligation. One hour after injection and five hours after ligation, animals were sacrificed. Liver alkaline phosphatase was purified by means of affinity chromatography and double immunoprecipitation with rabbit antibody to rat liver alkaline phosphatase and goat anti-rabbit gamma globulin. Bile duct ligation increased the incorporation of 3 -H-leucine into liver alkaline phosphatase more than threefold compared with sham operated rats, 164 CPM/mg protein vs. 49 CPM/mg protein (p <. 001).

Methods: A total of 73 patients younger than 18 years old diagnosed with primary osteosarcoma of the extremities between January 1998 and December 2013 were retrospectively evaluated. Prognostic factors such as age, gender, primary tumor site, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, metastatic disease, pathological fracture, histological response and surgery type were analyzed to evaluate their effects on overall (OS) and event free survival (EFS). Results: At a median follow-up of 30 months (1. 5 - 152), OS and EFS at 5 years was 64. 5 ± 8. 1 % and 48. 5 ± 8. 7 % for patients with localized disease; and 16. 2 ± 7. 9 % and 14. 4 ± 7. 3 % for patients with initial metastatic disease, respectively. In patients with localized disease, conservative surgery was performed on 22 of 46 patients (43. 5 %), {{and there was no}} significant difference in survival rates among patients who had conservative vs radical surgery (p= 0. 65).

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityIn metastatic {{carcinoma}} of the prostate, high levels of acid phosphatase {{are found in the}} serum (19). The measurement of acid phosphatase in serum is a valuable aid in diagnosis of this disease and in following the response to treatment. The prostate produces large amounts of acid phosphatase, and cancerous prostate as well as distant metastases show this ability. When the prostate is normal, no significant amount of the enzyme is present in the serum. It is found in semen in high concentration, and spasmodically in urine. Large amounts of the enzyme usually leak into the blood, however, from {{carcinoma of}} the prostate and from metastases of this origin (55). About 20 % of patients with prostatic carcinoma do not have abnormal levels even though the disease is far advanced (54). Since the acid phosphatase of serum is not all of prostatic origin, it is desirable to be able to distinguish the "prostatic" enzyme in dealing with prostatic disease. Serum contains variable amounts of non-prostatic acid phosphatases. This fraction consists of red cell acid phosphatase and others less well characterized. Acid phosphatases of different origin show different substrate specificities and respond differently to certain activators or inhibitors. A number of methods have been used to measure the fraction of the serum acid phosphatase which is of prostatic origin. The procedures adopted for this purpose are: 1. The substrate β-glycerophosphate is naturally selective toward prostatic acid phosphatase (54). 2. Inhibition by L-tartrate (14) using phenyl phosphate substrate. 3. Inhibition by alcohol and selective inactivation by heat (22). 4. Formaldehyde inactivation of the non-prostatic portion (33). 5. Comparison of hydrolysis rates between morpholine ethanol phosphate and β-glycerophosphate substrates (11). The phosphate group of yeast adenylic acid (3 -adenylic) is auite labile to phosphatase action. It {{has been used as a}} substrate in a number of phosphatase studies. Fischman et al. (13) employed 3 -adenylic acid for the assay of prostatic acid phosphatase in extracts of normal and abnormal prostatic tissue. They state: "This substrate, which is now commercially available, is particularly suitable for the determinations because of the rapid rate at which it is hydrolyzed by the enzyme. It is split by prostatic phosphatase about three times as rapidly as β-glycerophosphate. This difference might possibly be of value in blood analysis in order to distinguish prostatic phosphatase from acid phosphatases of other origin. " In a recent review Rosenmund (46) notes that the use of 3 -adenylic acid to distinguish prostatic phosphatase from other acid phosphatases in blood as suggested by Fischman et al. has not yet been confirmed. Three-Adenylic acid was employed by Bernhard and Rosenbloom (5) as a substrate for <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> <b>in</b> <b>serum.</b> They compared this substrate with adenosinetriphosphate and with β-glycerophosphate. They stated: "Yeast adenylic acid substrate gave the most consistent results, it is a stable compound, not subject to spontaneous hydrolysis in acid solutions. " This investigation was undertaken to devise a practical procedure for acid phosphatase assay in serum using adenylic acid as substrate and to determine its suitability for routine clinical use in distinguishing the prostatic portion of the acid phosphatase of serum. Experimental A method for the assay of acid phosphatase in serum using 3 -adenylic acid as substrate was developed. In most of the developmental procedures this substrate was compared with β-glycerophosphate. The procedure which was developed involves incubating serum with 3 -adenylic acid at a pH of 5. 75 in an acetate buffer. The concentration of 3 -adenylic acid selected as giving near maximal hydrolysis was 200 mg. per 100 ml. of the buffered substrate mixture. Higher substrate concentrations interfered with color development. The incubation was allowed to proceed for one hour at 38 °C; the hydrolysis was then arrested with trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated protein was separated by centrifugation. The inorganic phosphate hydrolyzed from the substrate was then determined colorimetrically by the procedure of Fiske and Subbarow (15). Slight modifications in the procedure were made to adapt it to the specific conditions of this test. The procedure of Fiske and Subbarow for inorganic P exhibits sensitivity to certain substances which may be present in the mixtures analyzed. Hence a study of the various components of these mixtures was made. When higher concentrations of either β-glycerophosphate or 3 -adenylic acid were used in the buffered substrates, color development was strongly inhibited. A concentration of 3 -adenylic acid of 250 mg. per 100 ml. allowed color development, but at 300 mg. per 100 ml. the development was slow. The rate of hydrolysis was determined for 3 -adenylic acid at various pH's. Three-adenylic acid was made up in 0. 2 M acetate buffers and the pH adjusted With acetic acid. A fairly broad and symmetrical maximum was obtained at about pH 5. 75. This pH value was incorporated into the procedure. The effect of the concentration of these substrates on hydrolysis by prostatic acid phosphatase was investigated. Graphing the data by the method of Lineweaver and Burke (40) allows an estimate of the maximum rate to be made. The hydrolysis rate increases more sharply with β-glycerophosphate than with 3 -adenylic as substrate concentrations are increased, so that 3 -adenylic acid is only very little more sensitive to prostatic phosphatase at the substrate concentrations selected. The concentration of 3 -adenylic which was selected (200 mg. per 100 ml.) gave about 89 % of the maximum hydrolysis rate. Increasing the substrate concentration beyond this would not result in a great gain in sensitivity of the test and would interfere with subsequent color development. Three-adenylic acid seems to be well adapted for serum acid phosphatase assay. However, its adoption for this purpose would not seem warranted unless it were shown to possess distinct advantages over substrates in common usage. Its principle value as a substrate would be its selectivity for prostatic acid phosphatase relative to phosphatases of other origin found in serum. This selectivity makes it potentially useful in the detection of {{carcinoma of the}} prostate. This substrate was compared with β-glycerophosphate and with phenyl phosphate from the standpoint of its selectivity for prostatic phosphatase and for erythrocytic phosphatase. It was shown to be very similar to β-glycerophosphate in this respect - sensitive to prostatic phosphatase and insensitive to erythrocytic phosphatase. In addition, at the substrate concentrations selected 3 -adenylic acid was hydrolyzed only about 6 % more rapidly than β-glycerophosphate by prostatic phosphatase. Hence its advantage in lability is rather small. Any advantage in the use of 3 -adenylic acid as a substrate to replace β-glycerophosphate in routine clinical determination of serum acid phosphatase would not seem to justify the trauma of "re-tooling the industry". Its selectivity for prostatic acid phosphatase is not greater, and it would be somewhat more expensive. This certainly does not imply that this substrate is not of value in investigational work with phosphatases...|$|E
