When she eventually asked him for a sitcom, he decided to base it around the evolution of their own relationship.

The series proved to be highly successful, running until 2004 and producing four series and twenty-eight episodes, all written by Moffat. He also wrote the original, unbroadcast pilot episode for the U.S. version, also titled Coupling, although this was less successful and was cancelled after four episodes on the NBC network.

The name Mya was believed to be a play on the words 'My assistant'.|$|E
5|$|Ground-based telescopes in California, Hawaii, the Canary Islands, Arizona, and Texas, {{as well as}} the Spitzer Space Telescope, {{were used}} to conduct these {{follow-up}} observations and verify Kepler-11b's existence.

Kepler-11b's discovery was <b>announced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public on February 2, 2011. It is part of the first system discovered with more than three transiting planets, and is also part of the most compact and flat system yet discovered.

5|$|The {{situation}} had escalated when, in 40 AD, Caligula <b>announced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> senate {{that he planned}} to leave Rome permanently and to move to Alexandria in Egypt, where he hoped to be worshipped as a living god.
