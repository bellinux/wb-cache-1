5|$|The {{length of}} the trinucleotide repeat {{accounts}} for 60% {{of the variation in}} the age symptoms <b>appear</b> <b>and</b> the rate they progress. A longer repeat results in an earlier age of onset and a faster progression of symptoms.

The remaining variation is due to environmental factors and other genes that influence the mechanism of the disease.|$|E
