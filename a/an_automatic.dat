5|$|As {{champions of}} the Atlantic Coast Conference, Virginia Tech was awarded <b>an</b> <b>{{automatic}}</b> bid to the Orange Bowl game.

5|$|To be <b>an</b> <b>{{automatic}}</b> process, {{the effect}} should, like other automatic processes involving preferences, {{be influenced by}} deliberate thought. Multiple {{studies have shown that}} thinking about feelings inhibits automatic responding. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg had subjects give their preferences for letters and numbers 1 to 50. They made half of them explain their preferences. They found a name-letter effect and birthday-number effect in those subjects asked to answer without thinking, but no effects in those asked to think. This points to the effect being the result of <b>an</b> <b>automatic</b> process.|$|E

50|$|Another {{innovation}} was {{the introduction}} of an alternator rather than a generator for electrical power. <b>A</b> three-speed <b>automatic</b> transmission was <b>a</b> major advance—the truck used <b>a</b> two-speed <b>automatic</b> less than <b>a</b> decade earlier.|$|R
