40|$|Abstract: Air coupled {{ultrasonic}} NDT using single transducers {{is growing}} in interest. The goal remains {{in the design of}} transducers sensitive enough to perform standard test protocols. Piezoelectric transducers specially adapted to <b>air</b> <b>coupling</b> have shown good performances at frequencies up to 5 MHz. Different labs and companies have started using these transducers for standard NDT. Nevertheless very little work has been made to extend the air-coupled testing with linear or phase array configurations. A novel piezoelectric array transducer design for <b>air</b> <b>coupling</b> has been designed, developed and tested. The array works at 0. 8 Mhz central frequency with 39 % bandwidth. The array has 32 active elements – 15 x 1 mm 2 -and has concave geometry with 35 mm radius. The transducer has two matching layers specially adapted to air loading and low impedance backing. The concave configuration permits different type of inspections. Lamb waves can be generated selecting a number of transducer channels and a delay configuration without rotating or moving the transducer. This design permits beam steering without alteration of the acoustic wave impact point. Focusing capabilities can also be tailored changing the aperture and the acoustic focal distance to adapt the inspection to different materials and geometries.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work {{described}} in this doctorate thesis has been to study {{the potential of the}} non-contact and non-destructive test (NDT) method, thermography, to detect glue deficiency beneath a thin laminated layer of wood. The technological applications can for example be found in the parquet flooring industry. The thesis is presented as a monography mainly based on five appended papers. The aim of the theoretical part, based on a literature survey, was to understand how thermal phenomena coupled to thermography theoretically can be described, how different factors and thermography methods affect the results of a thermography measurement and to know the status of delamination detection with thermography. The principal aim of the experimental measurements was to determine penetration depth, resolution, inspection time and repeatability for pulse, heating-up, and lock-in thermography. Using image thresholding as defect classification method, a method comparison has also been performed. Furthermore, the performances of another NDT method, <b>air</b> <b>coupled</b> ultrasound, was briefly investigated. Finally, the contrast detected by the two NDT methods has been validated with the crack test as a destructive reference test method. The results have showed/confirmed {{that it is possible to}} detect glue deficiency in laminated wood products with pulse, heating-up and lock-in thermography. Whenever time is not limiting, lock-in thermography should be used for each defect depth and is capable of detecting defects which are 4 times wider than the defect depth with at least a 2. 0 mm thick surface layer. Provided the signal to noise ratio (SNR) can be increased, pulse thermography is suitable for defect depths of 0. 5 - 1. 0 mm in an on-line application where inspection time is a critical parameter and lies around a few seconds. If the SNR cannot be sufficiently increased for pulse thermography, heating-up thermography is an alternative and should be used for defect depths between 0. 5 - 1. 4 mm. For <b>air</b> <b>coupled</b> ultrasound in transmission mode, the contrast and resolution did not decrease with defect depth down to 2 mm, which qualitatively makes it a competetive alternative to thermography. However, its inspection time is proportional to the scanned surface and might be very long if a good resolution is needed. The glue deficiency pattern of the fracture surfaces corresponded very well to the contrast pattern detected by thermography and <b>air</b> <b>coupled</b> ultrasound. Thereby, contrast detected by thermography and <b>air</b> <b>coupled</b> ultrasound can be regarded as being able to indicate reduction of the mechanical resistance of the glue line.

40|$|Composite materials, {{especially}} in aeronautics, often present themselves as thin structures of large lateral size. Their control is generally performed by pulse-echo technique using ultrasonic bulk waves. A way {{of reducing the}} inspection time could be to use Lamb waves.

In this work, the flow and heat transfer models of the cooling <b>air</b> <b>coupling</b> with the circulating water, are developed and numerically simulated for the anti-freezing analysis on basis of the finned tube bundles of the condenser cell. The local air-side heat transfer coefficient, condensate film development, and non-condensable gas development are obtained and analyzed in detail. The results show that, the most freezing risk happens at the fin base due to the highest air-side cooling capacity, besides the windward velocity, ambient temperature and turbine back pressure all determine the freezing risk with the constant inlet flow rate of the non-condensable gas. Furthermore, increasing fin thickness and decreasing fan rotating speed are the most effective anti-freezing measures. Additionally, increasing turbine back pressure can also be adopted to avoid ACC freezing, however the adjustment of outlet steam-air flow is not recommended...|$|E
