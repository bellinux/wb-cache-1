25|$|New {{migration}} patterns have appeared. Washington has a steadily declining black population, due to many African Americans' {{leaving the}} city for suburbs. At the same time, the city's Caucasian and Hispanic populations have steadily increased. Since 2000 {{there has been a}} 7.3% decrease in the African-American population, and a 17.8% increase in the European-American population. In addition, many African <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to the South in a New Great Migration, because of family ties, increased opportunities and lower cost of living. They still are a majority in the city, comprising 51 percent of the population.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{back across the}} Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|R
2500|$|Among {{the opponents}} of Batista, many wanted to {{accommodate}} the United States. However, Castro belonged to a faction which opposed U.S. influence. Castro did not forgive the U.S. supply of arms to Batista during the revolution. On 5 June 1958, {{at the height of}} the revolution, he had written: [...] "The <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to pay dearly for what they are doing. When the war is over, I'll start a much longer and bigger war of my own: the war I’m going to fight against them. That will be my true destiny". (The United States had stopped supplies to Batista in March 1958, but left its Military Advisory Group in Cuba). Thus, Castro had no intention to bow to the United States. [...] "Even though he did not have a clear blueprint of the Cuba he wanted to create, Castro dreamed of a sweeping revolution that would uproot his country's oppressive socioeconomic structure and of a Cuba that would be free of the United States".|$|E
2500|$|Eisenhower was {{a proponent}} of Roosevelt's New Deal and disapproved {{of the idea of}} the mass {{internment}}. Early on he had tried, unsuccessfully, to limit the internment to adult men, allowing women and children to remain free, and he pushed to keep WRA policy in line with the original idea of making the camps similar to subsistence homesteads in the rural interior of the country. This, along with proposals for helping Japanese Americans resettle in labor-starved farming communities outside the exclusion zone, was met with opposition from the governors of these interior states, who worried about security issues and claimed it was [...] "politically infeasible," [...] at a meeting in Salt Lake City in April 1942. Shortly before the meeting Eisenhower wrote to his former boss, Secretary of Agriculture Claude Wickard, and said, “when the war is over and we consider calmly this unprecedented migration of 120,000 people, we as <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to regret the unavoidable injustices that we may have done.” ...|$|E

60|$|But {{still it}} sticks in our throats, {{if we go}} so far, the Americans will go farther.--We do not know that. We ought, from experience, rather to presume the contrary.

I think this {{concession}} will rather fix a turnpike to prevent their further progress. It is impossible to answer for bodies of men. But I am sure the natural effect of fidelity, clemency, kindness in governors is peace, good-will, order, and esteem, {{on the part of}} the governed.

While we should not wish to show anything less than the chivalrous consideration for a beaten enemy which has been a tradition of our nation, we feel it is but just to say that for once the dirty pups got what was coming to them.

25|$|Operation Tindall was a {{deception}} {{that the}} British and <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to attack Norway, with the hypothetical goal of capturing Stavanger and its airfield.

The five divisions that were {{to be used in}} the sham invasion were real divisions camped in Scotland and the Allies had adequate aircraft and ships in Scotland to make the deception plan plausible. The only shortfall the Allies had with Tindall was their lack of military gliders. The Allies hoped Tindall would induce the Germans to retain the 12 divisions they had assigned to Norway.|$|R

2500|$|Alfred Vagts {{had already}} begun the {{discussion}} from an historical point of view, concentrating on the German/Prussian military experience.

[...] Louis Smith, whose work pre-dated Huntington's, discussed issues of congressional and judicial control over the military as well as executive civilian control of military matters. However, all that discussion predated a general recognition that the <b>American</b> experience <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to change in the}} post-World War II era. Once it became apparent that the <b>American</b> military <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to maintain historically high levels of active-duty personnel, concerns about the differences between civilian and military cultures quickly came to the forefront.

Meanwhile, Ben Crenshaw arranged the American lineup to put most of the strength at the beginning, knowing that a fast start was needed if the <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to recover from the four point deficit. This led to several early mismatches. James had not played three of his rookies during team play: Jarmo Sandelin, Jean van de Velde, and Andrew Coltart.

5000|$|Critics {{state that}} the tax cuts, {{including}} those given to middle and lower income households, failed to spur growth. Critics have further stated that the cuts also increased the budget deficit, shifted the tax burden from the rich to the middle and working classes, and further increased already high levels of income inequality. [...] Economists Peter Orszag and William Gale described the Bush tax cuts as reverse government redistribution of wealth, [...] "shifting the burden of taxation away from upper-income, capital-owning households and toward the wage-earning households of the lower and middle classes." [...] Supporters argued that the tax brackets were still more progressive than the brackets from 1986 until 1992, with higher marginal rates on the upper class, and lower marginal rates {{on the middle class}} than established by either the Tax Reform Act of 1986 or the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.Economist Simon Johnson wrote in 2010: [...] "The U.S. government doesn’t take in much tax revenue—at least 10 percentage points of GDP less than comparable developed economies—and it also doesn’t spend much except on the military, Social Security and Medicare. Other parts of government spending can be frozen or even slashed, but it just won’t make that much difference. That means older <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to get squeezed, while our ability to defend ourselves goes into decline. Just because there’s a bipartisan consensus on an idea, such as tax cuts, doesn’t mean it makes sense.

Although the air commitment for this plan was considerably less than Starkey’s, Eaker also criticized Wadham by saying that the combined bomber offensive would more effectively destroy the Luftwaffe than the diverted bomber resources could provide in support of Wadham. Other than aircraft, the Americans only had to provide 75 dummy landing craft to aid in the deception effort. The primary weakness in Wadham’s story was that the US forces <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to land outside of Allied tactical air support range.
