5|$|Although kings, {{rulers and}} {{powerful}} people have <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> {{to pay for}} entertainment {{to be provided for}} them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry. Sometimes referred to as show business, the industry relies on business models to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types. The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.|$|E
5|$|In New Guinea, {{logistics}} {{and construction}} activities were coordinated by task force engineer staffs. These were often hastily assembled {{and had not}} <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> {{to meet the demands}} imposed by base development in such a challenging theater of operations. The scale of operations in the Philippines was much greater, so for this purpose the Army Service Command (ASCOM) was formed in Brisbane on 23 July 1944. Casey was appointed to command ASCOM. In his absence, Sverdrup became MacArthur's chief engineer. Although part of USASOS, ASCOM operated under the control of Sixth Army, moving as far forward as combat operations allowed, developed new bases, and operated them until USASOS was ready to take over, at which point the units under ASCOM simply reverted to USASOS, allowing a seamless transfer of command. For the Battle of Leyte Casey's ASCOM had 43,000 men, of whom 21,000 were engineers.|$|E

The Bar won this particular argument, however, and as a result any body who can certificate advocates as qualified to hold rights of audience in the higher courts must have a code of conduct governing advocates who refuse cases.|$|E

500|$|The Wisconsin Supreme Court in State v. Sanapaw {{held that}} the treaty rights were {{terminated}} by Congress. In analyzing the case, the Wisconsin Supreme Court first had {{to determine whether the}} tribe had hunting and fishing rights under treaties with the United States. It found that although the Wolf River Treaty did not specifically mention hunting and fishing rights, the term [...] "to be held as Indian lands are held" [...] was clear. Indians have <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to hunt and fish on their own land, and if a term in a treaty with Indians is ambiguous, the Wisconsin Supreme Court found that it must be resolved in favor of the tribe. Since the tribe originally had hunting and fishing rights under the treaty, the Wisconsin Supreme Court then looked to determine whether Congress had removed those rights by enacting the Menominee Termination Act. The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that Congress had used its plenary power to abrogate those rights.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{good reviews}} from critics. [...] Brian Zoromski, of IGN, stated that [...] "'Business School' was {{an exercise in}} what works best in an Office episode." [...] Zoromski also praised Joss Whedon's directorial debut for the show, stating that [...] "Whedon's direction and sense of humor was both excellently put to use and alluded to in the scenes in which Jim hilariously pretended to become a vampire." [...] Zoromski {{went on to say}} that the acting of John Krasinski and Rashida Jones, who portrays Karen Filippelli, helped to make the vampire scenes the funniest parts of the episode. He gave the episode a 9.1 out of 10. [...] Abby West, of Entertainment Weekly, stated that [...] "This show has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to turn on a dime and take the comedy to a soul-stirring dramatic climax with just the lightest of touches, and last night was no different." [...] West went on to praise Michael and Pam's scene at the art show as one of these moments.|$|E
500|$|How to Grow a Woman {{from the}} Ground takes {{influence}} from different genres, “drawing equally from traditional bluegrass, progressive acoustic, and singer/songwriter traditions”, with one critic calling {{the majority of}} the album very “roots oriented”. The album has a bluegrass or progressive bluegrass core; bluegrass mandolinist Ronnie McCoury became the album’s official “bluegrass guru” to ensure that there was “someone who could make sure we didn’t do anything clichéd or trite”. In regard to [...] the album’s style, Thile said that “All in all, How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is a bluegrass record. There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, but it sounds like a bluegrass record to me. It’s not all like “Brakeman’s Blues,” but “Brakeman’s Blues” doesn’t sound out of place, and neither does “The Beekeeper” sound out of place. It’s all related.” Much of Thile's work on the album was influenced by his divorce, and Thile claims that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song. Thile said that he [...] "got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in. This girl just left. It created a pretty serious complex for me. [...] I’ve <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to talk to girls, but I’m scared of them. I just could relate to it. Like, man if I could just grow one, that would take care of a lot of problems." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 October 1869, {{a warrant}} for a {{commission}} of inquiry into {{the state of the}} College was established. The warrant issued on the behalf of the Duke of Norfolk, stated: [...] "that it is desirable that the College of Arms should be visited, and an inquiry instituted with the view of ascertaining whether the Rules and Orders for the good government of the said College... are duly obeyed and fulfilled... and whether by change of circumstances or any other cause, any new Laws, Ordinances or Regulations are necessary to be made... for the said College." [...] The commission had three members: Lord Edward Fitzalan-Howard (the Deputy Earl Marshal), Sir William Alexander (Queen's Counsel) and Edward Bellasis (a Sergeant at Law). Sir Bernard Burke (of the famous Burke's Peerage), at the time Ulster King of Arms, gave the commission the advice that the College should: [...] "be made a Government Department, let its Officers receive fixed salaries from Government, and let all its fees be paid into the public exchequer. This arrangement would, I am sure, be self-supporting and would raise at once the character of the Office and the status of the Heralds." [...] Burke's suggestion for reform was the same arrangement that had already been applied to the Lord Lyon Court in Scotland in 1867, and was to be applied to his own office in 1871. However unlike the Lyon Court, which was a court of law and part of the Scottish Judiciary, the College of Arms has always been an independent corporate body overseen by the Earl Marshal. While the Lord Lyon depended on the Government for its reforms and statutes, the College has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to carry out changes from within itself. The commission also drew attention to the fees, annulments and library of the College, as well as the general modernisation of the chapter as a whole. When the commission made its report in 1870, it recommended many changes, and these were duly made in another warrant dated 27 April 1871. Burke's recommendation, however, was not implemented.|$|E

Remember, therefore, all the fine things that your jurists and statesmen have said and written about the great palladium of British liberty and so forth: remember how the learned Sir William Blackstone hath delivered himself on this point;—how that 'the founders of the English laws have with excellent forecast contrived that the truth of every accusation, whether preferred in the shape of indictment, information, or appeal, should be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his (the accused person's) equals and neighbours, indifferently chosen, and superior to all suspicion.' A trial for 'sedition' here is a mere political voting, and as your faction (that is, the English faction,) have held the sole appointment of all the officers and clerks employed in that business, they have <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> by stealing lists, or juggling and falsifying cards, and numbers, to secure twelve men who will vote for the Castle, and find anyone guilty whom the Castle does not love..." ...|$|E

In early September 2006, ahead of the season three premiere episode, DeLay wrote, [...] "Sara Evans has been a strong supporter of the Republican Party and represents good American values in the media.
