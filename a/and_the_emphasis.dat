5|$|Lochner {{probably}} saw van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece {{during his}} visit to the Netherlands and seems to have borrowed a number of its compositional elements. The similarities include {{the manner in which the}} figures engage with their space <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> on and rendering of elements such as brocades, gems and metals. Some figures in Lochner's paintings are directly borrowed from Ghent, and a number of facial features match those seen in van Eyck. His Virgin with the Violet has often been compared to van Eyck's 1439 Virgin at the Fountain. Similarly to those in van Eyck's work, Lochner's angels often sing or play musical instruments, including lutes and organs.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Infantry Brigade {{took over}} {{the vanguard of the}} advance on 2 September, tasked with {{clearing}} the Germans from their positions overlooking Haplincourt. This they did after overcoming numerous machine gun nests, plus the guns of two disabled tanks being used as outposts. Over 350 prisoners of war were taken, along with 80 machine guns plus a field gun. Their advance was not as quick as that of the 42nd Division, making a corresponding move forward, which had made good progress and the British, until the New Zealanders caught up, had to lay down heavy suppressing fire on both flanks. The New Zealand Division now halted for a few days as pressure was being placed on the German lines elsewhere <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> for IV Corps was now to pursue the enemy to the Hindenburg Line.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the death}} of the founder, under the {{leadership}} of her son, Arthur Kent White, the religious fervor declined <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> on outreach evangelization and church planting ended; the organization branches in America fell from a high of around 52 to the current six.|$|E
25|$|Close agnatic {{marriage}} {{has also been}} seen {{as a result of the}} conceptualization of men as responsible for the control of the conduct of women.

25|$|To {{point out}} 'essential Zen-teachings' is almost impossible, given {{the variety of}} schools, the {{extended}} history of 1500 years, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> on suchness, reality just-as-it-is, which has to be expressed in daily life, not in words. But common to most schools and teachings is this emphasis on suchness and Buddha-nature, the Bodhisattva-ideal, and the priority of zazen.|$|E
25|$|A report {{published}} in 2004 by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission pointed to many Muslim Australians who felt the Australian media was unfairly critical of, and often vilified their community due to generalisations of terrorism <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> on crime. The use of ethnic or religious labels in news reports about crime {{was thought to}} stir up racial tensions.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{extensive}} defense cuts <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> placed on building a nuclear bomber force, none of the services were {{in a position to}} make a robust response with conventional military strength. General Omar Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was faced with re-organizing and deploying a U.S. military force that was a shadow of its World War II counterpart.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} some {{discussion}} among historians about the results Ashoka's propagation of Dhamma. Some historians believe that Ashoka's ban of sacrifices and the favour that he showed to Buddhism led to a Brahmanical reaction, which in turn led to the decline of Mauryan empire. Others believe that stopping of wars <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> on non-violence crippled the military might of the empire, leading to its collapse {{after the death of}} Ashoka.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} at least two {{successful}} attempts to formalize probability, namely the Kolmogorov formulation and the Cox formulation. In Kolmogorov's formulation (see probability space), sets are interpreted as events and probability itself as a measure on a class of sets. In Cox's theorem, probability is taken as a primitive (that is, not further analyzed) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> is on constructing a consistent assignment of probability values to propositions. In both cases, the laws of probability are the same, except for technical details.|$|E

They worked for two week intervals (opposite The Flaming Lips) in producer Dave Fridmann's Tarbox Road Studios, a converted Amish barn in Cassadaga, New York, through May the following year. Bassist Tim Nordwind described {{the process of the}} studio sessions as a midpoint between the slick production work done on OK Go <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> on live takes with the recording of Oh No.|$|E

25|$|The Western {{tradition}} of sculpture began in ancient Greece, and Greece is {{widely seen as}} producing great masterpieces in the classical period. During the Middle Ages, Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith. The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo's David. Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the depiction of the human body, with the making of constructed sculpture, and the presentation of found objects as finished art works.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} British {{version of}} the show debuted on 4 September 1998, and aired on ITV with Chris Tarrant as its host until 11 February 2014. International variants have aired in around 160 countries worldwide. The show's format is a twist on the game show genre—only one contestant plays at a time (similar to some radio quizzes), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> is on suspense rather than speed. In most versions there are no time limits to answer the questions, and contestants are given the question before they must decide whether to attempt an answer.|$|E
25|$|On December 4, 2013 Essex Police {{launched}} the ‘Stop the Hate’ initiative {{as part of}} a concerted effort {{to find new ways to}} tackle hate crime in Essex. The launch was marked by a conference in Chelmsford, hosted by Chief Constable Stephen Kavanagh, which brought together 220 delegates from a range of partner organisations involved in the field. The theme of the conference was ‘Report it to Sort it’ <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> was on encouraging people to tell police if they have been a victim of hate crime, whether it be based on race, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability.|$|E

40|$|Since 1994, {{the trend}} in <b>the</b> United States <b>and</b> other {{developed}} countries appears to be to reduce the scope of residence jurisdiction <b>and</b> increase <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> on source jurisdiction. If this trend continues, these countries are likely to move toward territoriality <b>and</b> decrease <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> on their CFC rules. In the author’s opinion, {{the reason for this}} trend is political and economic, not legal. It is part of tax competition, specifically the competition to be the headquarters jurisdiction for multinationals. The author also thinks, however, that {{it is not necessary to}} go down this road because the solution to the competitiveness issue is collaboration, not more competition...|$|R
25|$|Other nations {{experimented with}} self-loading rifles {{between the two}} World Wars, {{including}} the United Kingdom, which had intended to replace the bolt-action Lee–Enfield with a self-loader, possibly chambered for sub-caliber ammunition, but discarded that plan as the imminence of the Second World War <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> shifted from replacing every rifle with a new design to speeding-up re-armament with existing weapons. The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany would both issue successful self-loading and selective-fire rifles {{on a large scale}} {{during the course of the}} war, but not in sufficient numbers to replace their standard bolt-action rifles.|$|E
25|$|In {{analyzing}} nationalist {{successes in}} early 20th century Romania (Cultural Politics in Greater Romania), Irina Livezeanu {{builds on the}} theories of American social anthropologist Ernest Gellner, specifically on his definition of nationalism {{as a product of}} industrial society <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> he places on academics having promoted and imposed nationalist theses. She applied Gellner's ideas and concepts to a particular case, that of the predominantly rural Romanian society, and, in this context, linked them to the conclusions of Liah Greenfeld. According to Greenfeld and Livezeanu, although nationalism was generated by economic and social development in England, it grew independently from that point on, and was equally able to impose itself in less underdeveloped regions.|$|E
25|$|Wever {{was killed}} in an air {{accident}} in June 1936, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>emphasis</b> shifted back to more affordable (in manpower and material terms) medium bombers. After Wever's death, Göring and Ernst Udet became more active in the development programs. Udet favoured the close support designs, such as the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber, while Göring favoured having more medium bombers rather than a small number of heavy bombers. Richthofen did not get along with Udet, and did not believe in his ideas about dive bombing. Udet, much like Göring, favoured combining the qualities of aircraft. Udet sought out a design that could dog fight, dive bomb and carry out level bombing, much like Göring had requested. This was at odds with Richthofen's fundamental desire for aircraft that were easy to mass-produce and designed for, and to excel at, specialised tasks.|$|E
