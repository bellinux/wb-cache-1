5000|$|Men {{shake hands}} on meeting and departing. Men and women <b>kiss</b> <b>on</b> the cheek when greeting. Women <b>kiss</b> each other <b>on</b> the cheek. Friends, family and close acquaintances usually share <b>a</b> light <b>kiss</b> <b>on</b> the cheek.|$|R
25|$|Although cheek kissing is not {{as widely}} practiced in the United Kingdom or Ireland as {{in other parts of}} Europe, it is still commonplace. Generally, <b>a</b> <b>kiss</b> <b>on</b> one cheek is commonplace, however <b>a</b> <b>kiss</b> <b>on</b> each cheek is also practiced by some {{dependant}} on relation or reason. It is mostly used as a greeting and/or a farewell, but can also be offered as a congratulation or as a general declaration of friendship or love. Cheek kissing is acceptable between parents and children, family members (though not often two adult males), couples, two female friends or a male friend and a female friend. Cheek kissing between two men who are not a couple is unusual but socially acceptable if both men are happy to take part. Cheek kissing is associated with the middle and upper classes, as they are more influenced by French culture. This behaviour was traditionally seen as a French practice.|$|E
25|$|Where cheek kissing is used, in some {{countries}} a single kiss is the custom, while in others <b>a</b> <b>kiss</b> <b>on</b> each cheek is the norm, or even three or four kisses on alternating cheeks. In the United States, an air kiss is becoming more common. This involves kissing in the air near the cheek, with the cheeks touching or not. After a first date, {{it is common for}} the couple to give each other a quick kiss on the cheek (or lips where that is the norm) on parting, to indicate that a good time was had and perhaps to indicate an interest in another meeting.|$|E
25|$|Frequency {{of touch}} also varies {{significantly}} between different cultures. Harper refers to several studies, {{one of which}} examined touching in coffee houses. During a one-hour sitting 180 touchings were observed for Puerto Ricans, 110 for French, none for English and 2 for Americans. (Harper, 297). In order to know if someone was touching more frequently than normal {{it would be necessary}} to first know what is normal in that culture. In high touch countries <b>a</b> <b>kiss</b> <b>on</b> the cheek is considered a polite greeting while in Sweden it may be considered presumptuous. Jandt relates that two men holding hands will in some countries be a sign of friendly affection, whereas in the United States the same tactile code would probably be interpreted as a symbol of homosexual love (85).|$|E
