That’s a big part. Getting yourself in the right mental mindset and putting yourself through things that people - and you - don’t think are possible allows you to get to a place before the season starts where you feel like it doesn’t matter what you bring to me.

One of his contributions includes mapping out and documenting the reorganization of cortical regions after alterations due to plasticity. [...] While assessing the recorded changes in the primary somatosensory cortex of adult monkeys, he looked at several features of the data including how altered schedules of activity from the skin remap to cortical modeling and other factors that affect the representational remodeling of the brain. His findings within these studies have since been applied to youth development and children with language-based learning impairments. Through many studies involving <b>adaptive</b> <b>training</b> exercises on computer, he has successfully designed methods to improve their temporal processing skills. These adaptive measures include word-processing games and comprehension tests that involve multiple regions of the brain in order to answer. The results later translated into his development of the Fast ForWord program in 1996, which aims to enhance cognitive skills of children between kindergarten and twelfth grade by focusing on developing “phonological awareness.” [...] It has proven very successful at helping children with a variety of cognitive complications. In addition, it has led to in depth studies of specific complications such as autism and intellectual disability and the causes of them.

Exploiting properties of a stochastic max-plus algebra and system theory, the task of bandwidth estimation is formulated as inferring an unknown bounding function from measurements of probing traffic. We derive an estimation methodology that is based on iterative constant rate probes. Our solution provides evidence for the utility of packet trains for bandwidth estimation in the presence of variable cross traffic. Taking advantage of statistical methods, we show how our estimation method can be realized in practice, with <b>adaptive</b> <b>train</b> lengths of probe packets, probing rates, and replicated measurements required to achieve both high accuracy and confidence levels.

40|$|To achieve natural {{high quality}} {{synthesised}} speech in HMMbased speech synthesis, the effective modelling of complex acoustic and linguistic contexts is critical. Traditional approaches use context-dependent HMMs with decision tree based parameter clustering {{to model the}} full combination of contexts. However, weak contexts, such as word-level emphasis in neutral speech, are difficult to capture using this approach. To effectively model weak contexts and reduce the data sparsity problem, weak and normal contexts should be treated independently. Context <b>adaptive</b> <b>training</b> provides a structured framework for this whereby standard HMMs represent normal contexts and linear transforms represent additional effects of weak contexts. In contrast to speaker <b>adaptive</b> <b>training,</b> separate decision trees have to be built for the weak and normal context factors.

40|$|<b>Adaptive</b> <b>training</b> is {{a widely}} used {{technique}} for building speech recognition systems on non-homogeneous training data. Recently there has been interest in applying these approaches for situations where there is significant levels of background noise. Various schemes for <b>adaptive</b> <b>training</b> are based on noise, or speaker, specific transforms of the observed noise-corrupted speech to yield estimates of the clean speech. However when there are high levels of background noise, these clean speech estimates may be poor resulting in degradations in performance. In this work, a new approach for <b>adaptive</b> <b>training</b> on noise-corrupted training data is presented. It extends a popular form of linear transform for model-based adaptation and <b>adaptive</b> <b>training,</b> constrained MLLR (CMLLR), to reflect additional uncertainty from noise-corrupted observations. This new form of transform is called noisy CMLLR (NCM-LLR). NCMLLR uses {{a modified version of}} generative model between clean speech and noisy observation, similar to factor analysis (FA). However in contrast in FA here the generative model describes a transformation, rather than a covariance matrix structure. The use of NCMLLR for adaptation and <b>adaptive</b> <b>training</b> using an expectation-maximisation approach is described. Discriminative <b>adaptive</b> <b>training</b> with NCMLLR is also presented based on the minimum phone error criterion.

This paper investigates the model-based NAT scheme using joint uncertainty decoding (JUD) for subspace Gaussian mixture models (SGMMs).

JUD tackles the problem by sharing the compensation parameters among the Gaussians and hence reduces the computational and memory demands. For noise <b>adaptive</b> <b>training,</b> JUD is reformulated into a generative model, which leads to an efficient expectation-maximisation (EM) based algorithm to update the SGMM acoustic model parameters.
