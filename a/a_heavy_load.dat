5|$|Named {{for energy}} firm BP, which donated $5million toward its construction, {{it is the}} first Gehry-designed bridge to have been completed. BP Bridge is {{described}} as snakelike because of its curving form. Designed to bear <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>load</b> without structural problems caused by its own weight, it has won awards for its use of sheet metal. The bridge is known for its aesthetics, and Gehry's style is seen in its biomorphic allusions and extensive sculptural use of stainless steel plates to express abstraction.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites live almost {{exclusively}} on mice, and have become a specialist predator of house mice, often following outbreaks of mouse plagues in rural areas. They take other suitably sized creatures when available, including grasshoppers, rats, small reptiles, birds, and even (very rarely) rabbits, but mice and other mouse-sized mammals account for over 90% of their diet. Their influence on mouse populations is probably significant: adults take two or three mice a day each if they can, around a thousand mice a year. On one occasion, a male was observed bringing no less than 14 mice to a nest of well-advanced fledglings within an hour. In another study, a female kite was seen to struggle back to fledglings in the nest with a three-quarters grown rabbit, <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>load</b> for such a small bird.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{appreciated}} the PS2 version for including the asked-for save feature, but complained the ported game retained the AI and level design {{issues associated with}} the Windows version. IGN remarked that it looked less impressive than the computer versions. The lower resolution, flat textures, washed out colors, and sparser environments made the game average looking. The PS2 version also exhibited clipping issues; character models and projectiles would pass through objects on occasion. The game reviewer, however, praised the console version for presenting a smooth animation, rarely dropping frames. On the contrary, other reviewers stated the frame rate dropped when there are several objects on the screen, presenting <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>load</b> on the graphics engine. The lack of replay value for the console version after completing the single player mode was a common complaint among the reviewers.|$|E

5|$|The farther forward (closer {{to front}} wheel) {{the center of}} mass of the {{combined}} bike and rider, the less the front wheel has to move laterally {{in order to maintain}} balance. Conversely, the farther back (closer to the rear wheel) the center of mass is located, the more front wheel lateral movement or bike forward motion is required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase recumbents, choppers, and wheelie bikes. It can also be a challenge for touring bikes that carry <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>load</b> of gear over or even behind the rear wheel. Mass over the rear wheel can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass over the front wheel.|$|E
5|$|Hack, Starflight and the Ultima series were Adams' main influences. The roguelike Hack (1985) {{because of}} its {{randomly}} generated levels, deceased character persistence and detailed mechanics. Adams cited Ultima series as the inspiration for his generated worlds. The body part and wound system was inspired by 1990 role-playing game Cyberpunk 2020. He prefers modeling on individual elements, rather than entire systems, for better simulations with the outcomes being under his control. He said midpoint displacement generates the elevation {{of the world and}} its initial basic elements use fractals, which give it an overall natural look. He further explained that he made an algorithm to simulate rain shadows which occur in areas at the side of mountain deserts. For the distinct personalities of each unit, he took it from NEO PI-R test of which he admitted knowing little about. The feature of carps eating dwarves was unexpected when the game was released. He had written them having the same size and carps were designed to be carnivorous. A part of the game he felt tough, was implementing an A* search algorithm for pathfinding in any in-game character which, depending on their numbers and complexity of the path, can cause <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>load</b> on a computer. Adams composed the game's flamenco-inspired music.|$|E
5|$|The Campaign for Borders Rail {{claimed in}} February 2016 that only 35½% of {{services}} were arriving on time at Tweedbank, {{which made the}} Borders Railway one of ScotRail's most poorly-performing services. In addition, reliability issues with the Class 158 units and traincrew problems resulted {{in at least one}} train being cancelled on 74 of the 143 days between 31 March 2016 and 20 August 2016. This comprised 14 days of severe disruption due to crew shortages, 18 days as a result of issues with the Class 158s and nine days for signalling failures. Crew shortages came about due to higher than expected levels of sickness as well as the difficulty of replacing staff during a popular period for annual leave. Reliability issues with the Class 158s were encountered during hot weather which caused radiators to overheat, particularly on steep gradients with <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>load,</b> as coolant systems became stressed. To deal with the problem, ScotRail sought to replace the faulty radiators with superior quality models. Signalling problems were mainly due to water ingress into axle counters as well as a faulty telecommunications link coupled with a failure {{on the part of the}} automated fault-finding system to detect the problem locations.|$|E

The trailing engine axle under the cab carried <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>load</b> than the leading engine trailing axle and experienced continual problems with overheating. Also the coal bunker carried insufficient fuel in-service and this problem was never remedied, {{because it would have}} increased the axle loads beyond the light track capabilities.|$|R

The sturdy structure {{was able to}} carry <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>load</b> of ammunition along with about 2,200lb (998kg) of armor plate. The result was an angular machine of wire-braced wooden construction with plywood and fabric covering. A rectangular-section fuselage carried the forward gunner in an open nose position, the pilot in a semi-enclosed cockpit with armored shutters for forward vision, and the rear gunner in an open dorsal position. The engines were carried in mid-wing nacelles.|$|E
25|$|Formed by glacial meltwater, the Carbon River {{contains}} <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>load</b> {{of sediment}} such as silt and gravel. After {{emerging from the}} Carbon Glacier the Carbon River flows through a broad glacier-carved valley where thick sediment deposits in the stream bed create sand and gravel bars causing the river to become complexly braided, meandering, and flood-prone. The river frequently shifts channels and creates new ones in its valley. Between Fairfax and Carbonado the Carbon River flows through a narrow gorge (right) before emerging into another broad flood-prone valley near Crocker and Orting.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive load {{also plays}} a role in ironic control theory. Studies have shown that a greater {{cognitive}} load results in an increased possibility of dream rebound occurring. In other words, when one tries to retain <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>load</b> of information before going to sleep, there is a high chance of that information manifesting itself within the dream. There is a greater degree of dream rebound in those with a higher cognitive load opposed to those whose load was absent. With the enhancement of a high cognitive load, ironic control theory states thought suppression is more likely to occur and lead to dream rebound.|$|E

25|$|The {{capacity}} of an alkaline battery is strongly {{dependent on the}} load. An AA-sized alkaline battery might have an effective {{capacity of}} 3000mAh at low drain, but at a load of 1 ampere, which is common for digital cameras, the capacity could be as little as 700mAh. The voltage of the battery declines steadily during use, so the total usable capacity depends on the cut-off voltage of the application. Unlike Leclanche cells, the alkaline cell delivers about as much capacity on intermittent or continuous light loads. On <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>load,</b> capacity is reduced on continuous discharge compared with intermittent discharge, but the reduction is less than for Leclanche cells.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{class is}} worth 9 {{academic}} units {{and given the}} extensive core curriculum requirements in addition to individual options' degree requirements, students need to take an average of 40.5 units per term (more than four classes) in order to graduate in four years. 36 units is the minimum full-time load, 48 units is considered <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>load,</b> and registrations above 51 units require an overload petition. Approximately 20 percent of students double-major. This is achievable since the {{humanities and social sciences}} majors have been designed to be done in conjunction with a science major.

25|$|Different {{gears and}} ranges of gears are {{appropriate}} for different people and styles of cycling. Multi-speed bicycles allow gear selection to suit the circumstances: a cyclist could use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. In a lower gear every turn of the pedals leads to fewer rotations of the rear wheel. This allows the energy required to move the same distance to be distributed over more pedal turns, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>load,</b> or against strong winds. A higher gear allows a cyclist to make fewer pedal turns to maintain a given speed, but with more effort per turn of the pedals.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of European {{settlers}} in the 18th century, the Anacostia River was a fast-flowing and relatively silt-free river with very few mudflats or marshes. White settlers cleared much of the surrounding forest for farmland, however, and extensive soil erosion led to <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>load</b> of silt and effluent in the Anacostia. In 1805, local landowner Benjamin Stoddert built a wooden bridge over the Anacostia River at the present site of Benning Bridge. The bridge was sold to Thomas Ewell, who in the 1820s sold it to William Benning. Thereafter the structure was known as Benning's Bridge (or Benning Bridge). The wooden bridge was rebuilt several times after 1805. This included construction of a steel bridge in 1892. The construction of Benning and other bridges and the diversion of inflowing streams to agricultural use also slowed the river's current, allowing much of the silt to settle and be deposited.|$|E

Between 1860 and the late 1880s, large mudflats ("the Anacostia flats") formed on both banks of the Anacostia River due to this deforestation and runoff. At this time, the city allowed its sewage to pour untreated into the Anacostia. Marsh grass began growing in the flats, trapping the sewage and leading public health experts to conclude that the flats were unsanitary. Health officials also feared that the flats were a prime breeding ground for malaria- and yellow fever-carrying mosquitoes.|$|E
