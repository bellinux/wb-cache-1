40|$|Introduction: Social {{relationships}} {{are increasingly being}} acknowledged as determinants of wellbeing and health in later life. We know that people who feel lonely – i. e. who are unhappy about their relationships – or who are socially isolated – i. e. have few ties or contacts with others – {{are more likely to}} experience early death. Whether they are at greater risk of morbidity is unclear. Aim: This thesis examines whether loneliness <b>and</b> social <b>isolation</b> are risk factors for developing ill health, with a primary focus on incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim is to gauge the potential health gain from tackling loneliness <b>and</b> social <b>isolation.</b> Methods: Four pieces of empirical research make up the main body of my thesis. First, I designed a novel framework for distinguishing between measures of loneliness <b>and</b> social <b>isolation.</b> I then systematically reviewed the evidence from longitudinal observational studies on loneliness, social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> incident CVD. I studied changes in loneliness <b>and</b> social <b>isolation</b> over time in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), a cohort of adults aged over 50 years old.

5|$|Behnke in his {{salmon and}} trout {{handbook}} of 2002 recognized 14 subspecies of cutthroat trout that are each native to a separate geographic area. Not {{all of them were}} scientifically described, and different views on the taxonomic identities have been presented in some cases. It has been suggested that the cutthroat trout evolved from a common Oncorhynchus ancestor that migrated along the Pacific coast and into the mountain west primarily via the Columbia and Snake river basins 3-5million years ago, in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene epochs. These epochs had repeated glacial and interglacial periods that would have caused repeated fracturing <b>and</b> <b>isolation</b> of cutthroat trout populations, eventually resulting in the different subspecies found today. The 14 subspecies are found in four evolutionary groups—Coastal, Westslope, Yellowstone and Lahontan.|$|E
5|$|Five of the state's {{counties}} are wholly {{within the boundaries}} of sovereign Indian reservations. Because of the limitations of climate and land, <b>and</b> <b>isolation</b> from urban areas with more employment opportunities, living standards on many South Dakota reservations are often far below the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009. The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, on the Crow Creek Reservation, is 70%, and 21% of households lack plumbing or basic kitchen appliances. A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Bureau found 58% of homes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation did not have a telephone. The reservations' isolation also inhibits their ability to generate revenue from gaming casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centers.|$|E

Trotsky argued that Stalin's theory represented the interests of bureaucratic elements in direct opposition to the working class.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In this paper, the {{concepts}} of social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness will be explored in relation to people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Through this, biological, psychological and social factors will be examined to consider how we can identified people at risk of social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness who have chronic musculoskeletal pain and secondly how health professionals may intervene to reduce their effects. Design/methodology/approach: Conceptual paper. Findings: Social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness is evident in people with chronic musculoskeletal diseases. This may be bi-directional where both pain may lead to social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness, or social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness may exacerbate pain. Interventions to improve the symptoms of chronic musculoskeletal pain, and approaches around social participation and engagement should be adopted in combination to ameliorate this potentially disabling scenario. Originality/value: There remains limited evidence around the prevalence and management of social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness for people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. By raising awareness of social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness in this population, people with chronic musculoskeletal pain may be better supported to reduce the negative impact that social <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> loneliness can have on their health and well-being...|$|R

5|$|Raskolnikov's dreams have a {{symbolic}} meaning, which suggests a psychological view. The {{dream of the}} mare being whipped has been suggested as the fullest single expression of the whole novel, symbolizing gratification and punishment, contemptible motives and contemptible society, depicting the nihilistic destruction of an unfit mare, the gratification therein, and Rodion's disgust and horror, {{as an example of}} his conflicted character. Raskolnikov's disgust and horror is central to the theme of his conflicted character, his guilty conscience, his contempt for society, his rationality of himself as an extraordinary man above greater society, holding authority to kill, and his concept of justified murder. His reaction is pivotal, provoking his first taking of life toward the rationalization of himself as above greater society. The dream is later mentioned when Raskolnikov talks to Marmeladov. Marmeladov's daughter, morally chaste and devout Sonya, must earn a living as a prostitute for their impoverished family, the result of his alcoholism. The dream is also a warning, foreshadowing an impending murder and holds several comparisons to his murder of the pawnbroker. The dream occurs after Rodion crosses a bridge leading out of the oppressive heat and dust of Petersburg and into the fresh greenness of the islands. This symbolizes a corresponding mental crossing, suggesting that Raskolnikov is returning to a state of clarity when he has the dream. In it, he returns to the innocence of his childhood and watches as a group of peasants beat an old mare to death. After Raskolnikov awakes, he reflects on it as a “such a hideous dream,” the same term he earlier used to describe his plot to kill the old woman (62). This diction draws a parallel between the two, suggesting that the child represents the part of him that clings to morality and watches horrified as another facet, represented by the peasants, is driven by hardship <b>and</b> <b>isolation</b> to become cold and unfeeling. The constant laughing of the peasants in the face of brutal slaughter reveals {{the extent to which they}} have been desensitized by their suffering, which is a reflection of Raskolnikov’s own condition. This interpretation is further supported by fact that the main peasant, Mikolka, feels that he has the right to kill the horse, linking his actions to Raskolnikov’s theory justifying murder for a select group of extraordinary men. The comparison between the cruel slaughter of the old mare and the plan to murder Alyona Ivanovna delineates the brutality of Raskolnikov’s crime, which is often downplayed by his habitual dehumanizing referral to the old woman as simply a “louse.” While awake, Raskolnikov’s view of the old woman is spiteful, defined by his tenacious belief in his extraordinary man theory. However, the dream acts as a conduit for Raskolnikov’s subconscious, and without the constraints of his theory the horrific nature of his crime becomes apparent. Therefore, in order for Raskolnikov to find redemption, he must ultimately renounce his theory.|$|E
