40|$|In our {{designed}} culture, every environment, {{object and}} picture is analyzed {{from the viewpoint}} of colour <b>and</b> <b>light.</b> Colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> {{play an important role in}} social life and culture. This paper springs from an epistemological project about concept formation in the field of colour <b>and</b> <b>light.</b> Based on own observations and scientific and scholarly references it presents a graphic model describing possible constituent relations between colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> experiences. Design is the art of using knowledge – implicit or explicit – about how humans perceive, experience, and relate to the world around. In design all senses are involved, but when dealing with colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> we can confine ourselves to vision; designers must understand the conditions of visual perception. Human experience of colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> has many sources; the given cultural context (conventional meanings of colour <b>and</b> <b>light),</b> the direct experience of the world around (colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> expressions) <b>and</b> the basic perceptual functions (formal aspects of colour <b>and</b> <b>light).</b> There is need for distinct concepts and concise approaches to understand coherence of aesthetic and functional expressions. Design education calls for coherent and well defined structures that can be used to describe connections and distinctions between experiences of different kinds.

40|$|The {{research}} project SYN-TES aims at {{contributing to a}} theoretical development transforming the field of colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> into a coherent field of research. This includes the identification of important problems {{and the development of}} theoretical and methodological tools for the trans-disciplinary understanding necessary to solving them. Special emphasis is put on the spatial interaction of colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> in architecture. The work has the form of seminars /workshops where colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> specialists from different academic disciplines (six Nordic universities) <b>and</b> companies (<b>light</b> sources, paint, colorimetric standards, window glass) examine different aspects of the problem complex. Sub-projects deal with the epistemology and concepts of colour <b>and</b> <b>light,</b> with methods for analysing colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> in existing architectural spaces and with the relationship between energy efficiency <b>and</b> <b>light</b> quality...|$|R

5|$|Heavier {{isotopes}} of neptunium decay quickly, <b>and</b> <b>lighter</b> isotopes of neptunium {{cannot be}} produced by neutron capture, so chemical separation of neptunium from cooled spent nuclear fuel gives nearly pure 237Np. The short-lived heavier isotopes 238Np and 239Np, useful as radioactive tracers, are produced through neutron irradiation of 237Np and 238U respectively, while the longer-lived lighter isotopes 235Np and 236Np are produced through irradiation of 235U with protons and deuterons in a cyclotron.|$|E
5|$|Materials for the building's {{exterior}} {{were chosen}} with careful precision.

5|$|Mycenaean armies shared several common {{features}} with other significant Late Bronze Age powers: they were initially based on heavy infantry, which bore spears, large shields and, in some occasions, armor. Later in the 13th century BC, Mycenaean warfare underwent major changes both in tactics and weaponry. Armed units became more uniform and flexible, while weapons became smaller <b>and</b> <b>lighter.</b> The spear remained the main weapon among Mycenaean warriors until {{the collapse of}} the Bronze Age, while the sword played a secondary role in combat.|$|E

5|$|The M15 was {{equipped}} with the M42 armored weapon mount, with two water-cooled coaxial M2 Browning machine guns above a 37mm gun. A total of 680 M15s were produced in 1943 by White and Autocar before the considerable stress this mount placed on the M3 chassis, which resulted in its replacement with the M54 mount. The new mount reversed weapon placement, used simpler <b>and</b> <b>lighter</b> air-cooled M2 Brownings, and added a M6 sighting system.|$|E

5|$|The {{center of}} the city {{contained}} several reinforced concrete buildings <b>and</b> <b>lighter</b> structures. Outside the center, the area was congested by a dense collection of small timber-made workshops set among Japanese houses. A few larger industrial plants lay near the outskirts of the city. The houses were constructed of timber with tile roofs, and many of the industrial buildings were also built around timber frames. The city as a whole was highly susceptible to fire damage.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely haired tail {{is about}} as long as the head and body. It is dark brown above <b>and</b> <b>lighter</b> below. In contrast, the tail of H.megacephalus has little to no {{difference}} in color between the upper and lower surface. In 2006, Weksler and colleagues noted tail coloration as a difference between the two species of Transandinomys (bicolored in T.talamancae and unicolored in T.bolivaris), but in their 1998 study, Musser and colleagues could not find differences in tail coloration between their Panamanian samples of the two species.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} a slight decline in numbers in Europe since 1980, {{although}} the Scandinavian population is growing. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged <b>and</b> <b>lighter</b> than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.|$|E
