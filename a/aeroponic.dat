50|$|<b>Aeroponics</b> {{became known}} as a time and cost saver. The {{economic}} factors of <b>aeroponic’s</b> contributions to agriculture were taking shape.|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{have shown}} that <b>aeroponics,</b> {{more than any other}} form of {{agricultural}} technology, will significantly improve Vietnam's potato production. We have very little tillable land, <b>aeroponics</b> makes complete economic sense to us”, attested Thach.|$|R
50|$|The {{historical}} significance for <b>aeroponics</b> {{is that it}} is the first time a nation has specifically called out for <b>aeroponics</b> to further an agricultural sector, stimulate farm economic goals, meet increased demands, improve food quality and increase production.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, R. Stoner filed {{a patent}} {{for the first}} {{microprocessor}} interface to deliver tap water and nutrients into an enclosed <b>aeroponic</b> chamber made of plastic. Stoner {{has gone on to}} develop numerous companies researching and advancing <b>aeroponic</b> hardware, interfaces, biocontrols and components for commercial <b>aeroponic</b> crop production.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aeroponic</b> {{equipment}} {{involves the}} use of sprayers, misters, foggers, or other devices to create a fine mist of solution to deliver nutrients to plant roots. <b>Aeroponic</b> systems are normally closed-looped systems providing macro and micro-environments suitable to sustain a reliable, constant air culture. Numerous inventions have been developed to facilitate <b>aeroponic</b> spraying and misting. The key to root development in an <b>aeroponic</b> environment is the size of the water droplet. In commercial applications, a hydro-atomizing spray at 360° is employed to cover large areas of roots utilizing air pressure misting.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, Ed Harwood, {{founder of}} AeroFarms, invented an <b>aeroponic</b> system that grows {{lettuces}} on micro fleece cloth. [...] AeroFarms, utilizing Harwood's patented <b>aeroponic</b> technology, is now operating the largest indoor vertical {{farm in the}} world based on annual growing capacity in Newark, New Jersey. By using <b>aeroponic</b> technology the farm is able to produce and sell up to two million pounds of pesticide-free leafy greens per year.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{after its}} development, <b>aeroponics</b> took hold as a {{valuable}} research tool. <b>Aeroponics</b> offered researchers a noninvasive way to examine roots under development. This new technology also allowed researchers a larger number and {{a wider range of}} experimental parameters to use in their work.|$|R
50|$|The {{ability to}} {{precisely}} control the root zone moisture levels {{and the amount}} of water delivered makes <b>aeroponics</b> ideally suited for the study of water stress. K. Hubick evaluated <b>aeroponics</b> as a means to produce consistent, minimally water-stressed plants for use in drought or flood physiology experiments.|$|R

50|$|NASA has funded {{research}} and development of new advanced materials to improve <b>aeroponic</b> reliability and maintenance reduction. It also has determined that high pressure hydro-atomized mist of 5-50 micrometres micro-droplets is necessary for long-term <b>aeroponic</b> growing.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, Stoner {{received}} NASA {{funding to}} develop a high performance <b>aeroponic</b> system for earth and space. Stoner demonstrated that a dry bio-mass of lettuce can be significantly increased with aeroponics. NASA utilized numerous <b>aeroponic</b> advancements developed by Stoner.|$|E
50|$|Abstract: Aeroponics International’s (AI’s) {{innovation}} is a self-contained, self-supporting, inflatable <b>aeroponic</b> crop production unit with integral environmental {{systems for the}} control and delivery of a nutrient/mist to the roots. This inflatable <b>aeroponic</b> system addresses the needs of subtopic 08.03 Spacecraft Life Support Infrastructure and, in particular, water and nutrient delivery systems technologies for food production. The inflatable nature of our innovation makes it lightweight, allowing it to be deflated so it takes up less volume during transportation and storage. It improves on AI’s current <b>aeroponic</b> system design that uses rigid structures, which use more expensive materials, manufacture processes, and transportation. As a stationary <b>aeroponic</b> system, these existing high-mass units perform very well, but transporting and storing them can be problematic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aeroponics</b> is {{the ideal}} tool {{for the study of}} root morphology. The absence of {{aggregates}} offers researchers easy access to the entire, intact root structure without the damage that can be caused by removal of roots from soils or aggregates. It’s been noted that <b>aeroponics</b> produces more normal root systems than hydroponics.|$|R

50|$|Water {{droplet size}} {{is crucial for}} {{sustaining}} <b>aeroponic</b> growth. Too large a water droplet means less oxygen is available to the root system. Too fine a water droplet, such as those generated by the ultrasonic mister, produce excessive root hair without developing a lateral root system for sustained growth in an <b>aeroponic</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|By 1985, GTi {{introduced}} {{second generation}} aeroponics hardware, {{known as the}} [...] "Genesis Growing System". This second generation <b>aeroponic</b> apparatus was a closed-loop system. It utilized recycled effluent precisely controlled by a microprocessor. Aeroponics graduated to the capability of supporting seed germination, thus making GTi's the world's first plant and harvest <b>aeroponic</b> system.|$|E

40|$|A clear {{description}} of the mechanism of root cadmium absorption is {{required in order to}} understand how this toxic metal is phytoaccumulated. An experiment was carried out in order to test the hypotheses that (1) the Cd uptake is higher for maize roots grown in hydroponics than for those grown in <b>aeroponics,</b> (2) this difference {{is due to the fact}} that in <b>aeroponics,</b> root apoplastic barriers are developed more extensively than in hydroponics and (3) the structure of maize roots grown in <b>aeroponics</b> is closer to the structure of roots grown in soil. Apoplastic and symplastic cadmium uptake was measured by exposing the roots to a radio-labelled Cd solution and by the physical fractionation of the metal in the roots. Maturation of the exodermis and endodermis as well as their distance from the root tip were assessed through fluorescent staining and microscopy of successive sections along the main root. The results obtained support the initial hypotheses. Both symplastic absorption and apoplastic adsorption of Cd were higher for maize roots grown in hydroponics than in <b>aeroponics.</b> This can be explained by the fact that the beginning of the barrier formation took place on average at a distance of 12. 46 % of the root length from its tip, while in <b>aeroponics,</b> root apoplastic barriers developed much earlier, at 2. 72 % of the root length. Since the characteristics of maize plants roots cultivated in <b>aeroponics</b> were much closer to those cultivated in soil, their kinetic parameters may be considered to be more representative when measuring uptake than those of hydroponically grown plants...|$|R
