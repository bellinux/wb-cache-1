25|$|After M.H. Klaproth had {{discovered}} the presence of potassium in leucite and lepidolite, it occurred to L. N. Vauquelin that it was probably an ingredient likewise in many other minerals. Knowing that <b>alum</b> cannot be obtained in crystals without the addition of potash, he began to suspect that this alkali constituted an essential ingredient in the salt, and in 1797 he published a dissertation demonstrating that <b>alum</b> is a double salt, composed of sulfuric acid, alumina, and potash. Soon after, J.A. Chaptal published the analysis of four different kinds of <b>alum,</b> namely, Roman <b>alum,</b> Levant <b>alum,</b> British <b>alum</b> and <b>alum</b> manufactured by himself. This analysis led to the same result as Vauquelin.|$|R

25|$|Many {{trivalent}} metals {{are capable}} of forming <b>alums.</b> The general form of an alum is AMIII(SO4)2·nH2O, where A is an alkali metal or ammonium, MIII is a trivalent metal, and n often is 12. In general, <b>alums</b> are easier formed when the alkali metal atom is larger. This rule was first stated by Locke in 1902, who found that if a trivalent metal does not form a caesium alum, it neither will form an alum with any other alkali metal or with ammonium.|$|E
25|$|Sodium sulfate {{displays}} a moderate tendency to form double salts. The only <b>alums</b> formed with common trivalent metals are NaAl(SO4)2 (unstable above 39°C) and NaCr(SO4)2, {{in contrast to}} potassium sulfate and ammonium sulfate which form many stable <b>alums.</b> Double salts with some other alkali metal sulfates are known, including Na2SO4·3K2SO4 which occurs naturally as the mineral glaserite. Formation of glaserite by reaction of sodium sulfate with potassium chloride {{has been used as}} the basis of a method for producing potassium sulfate, a fertiliser. Other double salts include 3Na2SO4·CaSO4, 3Na2SO4·MgSO4 (vanthoffite) and NaF·Na2SO4.|$|E

The significant {{of this study is to}} recover aluminium sulphate (<b>alum)</b> from <b>alum</b> sludge. Acidification process applied to <b>alum</b> sludge to recover aluminium sulphate (<b>alum).</b> Acidification using sulphuric acid will separate particulate solids and aluminium sulphate(alum). Aluminium sulphate (<b>alum)</b> will be recovered in aqueous solution, while particulate solids will remain in solid form.

These factors will give effects to the precipitation period, aluminium sulphate (<b>alum)</b> recovery and the percentage of aluminium recovery efficiency. From the experiments, the best volume recovered is at 2. 5 of pH values, 100 rpm stirring speeds and 40 minutes centrifugation time.

40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} newly {{formulated}} enterotoxaemia vaccine having oil and <b>alum</b> adjuvants, with presently available toxoid and <b>alum</b> precipitated vaccines. Materials and Methods: Three types of enterotoxaemia vaccines, namely toxoid (TV), <b>alum</b> precipitated (APV) and <b>alum</b> precipitated {{oil adjuvant vaccine}} (AOV) were prepared using a highly toxigenic strain of Clostridium perfringens type D procured from Division of Biological Standardization, IVRI, Izatnagar. Humoral immunity generated in rabbits with these vaccines was then quantified using {{indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) and mice neutralization test (MNT). Results: Out of three enterotoxaemia vaccines tested, <b>alum</b> precipitated oil adjuvant vaccine produced higher and persistent antibody titre for more than 45 days without any booster dose and did not produce any untoward reactions at the injection site. <b>Alum</b> precipitated vaccine elicited better and persistent immune response than toxoid vaccine though it was less than <b>alum</b> precipitated oil adjuvant vaccine. In MNT, <b>alum</b> precipitated and <b>alum</b> precipitated oil adjuvant vaccines showed protection at 45 th day of post vaccination while toxoid vaccine showed only up to 28 th day. Conclusion: Results of the study unfolded the synergistic role of adjuvants in the induction of better and persistent immune response and also indicated the superiority of <b>alum</b> precipitated oil adjuvant vaccine over the currently available toxoid and <b>alum</b> precipitated enterotoxaemia vaccines.

40|$|Coagulation/flocculation {{is one of}} the {{treatment}} method for highly polluted leachate. One of the main affecting factor for this process is the coagulant used. Coagulant is divided into natural and chemical coagulant. In the current study, <b>Alum</b> (chemical coagulant) and barley (natural coagulant) were used as dual coagulant. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the effectiveness of dual coagulant made from <b>alum</b> and barley in removing colour from the effluent of Simpang Renggam landfill leachate aeration lagoon through coagulation/flocculation method. Coagulation/flocculation process with single <b>alum</b> coagulant, single barley coagulant and dual coagulant (alum+barley) were examined by evaluating the optimum values of pH and dose. Optimum dose and pH for <b>alum</b> and barley as single coagulant were; 3 g/L & pH 5; 0. 8 g/L & pH 6. Higher removal of colour was recorded for <b>alum</b> compared to barley. Application of <b>alum</b> and barley as dual coagulant had higher colour removal than <b>alum</b> and barley as single coagulant. The optimum pH and dose for dual coagulant were at pH 6, 3. 0 g/L of <b>alum</b> and 0. 8 g/L of barley respectively. However, at pH 6, 2 g/L <b>alum</b> and 1. 6 g/L barley, the removal of colour was similar to <b>alum</b> at 3 g/L. It can be concluded that barley as coagulant aid able to reduce 33 % usage of <b>alum</b> at par removals of colour. Thus, the dual coagulant consist of <b>alum</b> and barley has the potential to be applied as a coagulant for leachate treatment...|$|R
