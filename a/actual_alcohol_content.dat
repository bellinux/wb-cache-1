50|$|Once {{fermentation}} {{has been}} completed, {{at a minimum}} alcohol level of 10% (which is often exceeded), the alcoholic strength of Commandaria may be increased {{by the addition of}} pure 95% grape alcohol or a wine distillate of at least 70% alcohol. However, after this addition, the wine's <b>actual</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> may not exceed 20%, while its total potential alcohol (including its sugar content) must be at least 22.5%. Thus, Commandaria may be a fortified wine, but fortification is not mandatory.|$|E
5000|$|A {{version of}} Budweiser Select that {{contains}} [...] is [...] "a direct counterstrike to Miller's MGD 64" [...] according to Anheuser-Busch officials. Budweiser currently {{claims that it}} is the lightest beer in the world. The food energy in both Miller's MGD 64 and Budweiser's Select 55 have been reduced simply by lowering the fermentables content. MGD 64 has only 2.8% alcohol content and some Select 55 states [...] "alcohol content not more than 3.2% by weight / 4% by volume", possibly to allow its sale in areas where that is the limit. The <b>actual</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> of [...] "55" [...] is reported to be 2.4% ABV; by comparison, most American lagers have around 5%.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{alcohol content}} is {{measured}} in terms of the percentage of alcohol by volume. The Code of Federal Regulations (27 CFR Edition §5.37 Alcohol content) requires that liquor labels must state the percentage of ABV. The regulation permits, but does not require, a statement of the proof provided that it is printed close to the ABV number. For bottled spirits over 100 mL containing no solids, <b>actual</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> is allowed to vary within 0.15% of ABV stated on the label. Alcohol proof in the United States is defined as twice the percentage of alcohol by volume. Consequently, 100-proof whiskey contains 50% alcohol by volume; 86-proof whiskey contains 43% alcohol. In the United States the term [...] "degrees proof" [...] is normally not used. For example, 50% ABV would be described as [...] "100 proof" [...] rather than [...] "100 degrees proof".|$|E

40|$|Many {{economists and}} others are {{interested}} in the phenomenon of rising alcohol content of wine and its potential causes. Has the alcohol content of wine risen—and if so, by how much, where, and when? What roles have been played by climate change and other environmental factors compared with evolving consumer preferences and expert ratings? In this paper we explore these questions using international evidence, combining time-series data on the alcohol content of wine from a large number of countries that experienced different patterns of climate change and influences of policy and demand shifts. We also examine the relationship between the <b>actual</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> of wine and the alcohol content stated on the label. The systematic patterns here suggest that rising alcohol content of wine may be a nuisance by-product of producer responses to perceived market preferences for wines having riper, more-intense flavors, possibly in conjunction with evolving climate. wine grapes, alcohol percentage, climate change, labeling errors, Agricultural and Food Policy, Crop Production/Industries, Demand and Price Analysis, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Marketing,...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} effects {{previously}} attributed to pharmacological properties of alcohol {{have been shown}} to result from cognitive factors. For example, subjects believing alcohol was consumed show greater craving for alcohol and consume more beverage than subjects believing alcohol was not consumed, regardless of whether these beliefs are accurate. This has been demonstrated using the balanced placebo design. Many researchers, however, have argued that these experiments should be conducted in a natural drinking environment to assess the external validity of previous laboratory findings, and to investigate possible interaction effects resulting from the presence of alcohol-associated environmental cues. This is important for clinical considerations, as treatment recommendations based on laboratory findings may be less relevant in the natural setting where the behaviour to be treated actually occurs.;To permit maximization of ecological validity in Study II, the drinking practices of undergraduate males were assessed in Study I. Results indicated that most often beer is consumed in on-campus bars, and that significant high levels of drinking and alcohol-associated problems were evident. In Study II, the balanced placebo experiment was conducted in an on-campus bar, and in a laboratory, thus permitting investigation of the relative influence of pharmacological, cognitive, and environmental variables on alcohol-related behaviour. Results indicated that beverage consumption in the laboratory was primarily determined by subjects 2 ̆ 7 beliefs regarding the alcohol content, but that subjects 2 ̆ 7 reported beliefs had no effect on consumption in the barroom. In the barroom, subjects began drinking sooner, drank more, and neither beliefs nor <b>actual</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> had any influence on drinking behaviour. Subjective drunkenness was influenced by beliefs and setting, while behavioural impairment was influenced by beliefs and alcohol content.;It was concluded that analogue alcohol studies can and should be replicated in natural drinking environments, as results and clinical implications may differ. These findings suggest that pharmacological, cognitive, and environmental variables interact in a complex manner to produce a variety of effects, and that of these variables, consideration of environmental influences in alcohol treatment programs may be critical to their success...|$|E
