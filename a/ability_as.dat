5|$|Aspasia, who {{was noted}} for her <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> a conversationalist and adviser, {{was accused of}} corrupting the women of Athens {{in order to satisfy}} Pericles' perversions. The accusations against her were {{probably}} nothing more than unproven slanders, but the whole experience was very bitter for Pericles. Although Aspasia was acquitted thanks to a rare emotional outburst of Pericles, his friend, Phidias, died in prison and another friend of his, Anaxagoras, was attacked by the ecclesia for his religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Director Mike Nichols, who {{had seen}} Cher onstage in Jimmy Dean, offered her the part of Dolly Pelliker, a plant co-worker and Meryl Streep's lesbian roommate in the film Silkwood.

For her performance, Cher won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture.|$|E

5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Chaos: {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Sun Shield and Gauntlet of Zeus—offering alternative combat options. Kratos only learns three magical abilities, as opposed to four in previous installments, including the Efreet, the Light of Dawn, and Charon's Wrath, giving him {{a variety of ways}} to attack and kill enemies. He acquires the relic Triton's Lance—similar to Poseidon's Trident in God of War— which allows him to breathe underwater; a necessary <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> parts of the game require long periods of time there.|$|E

5|$|Pierce {{was finally}} {{allowed to return}} to Concord in late December 1847. He was given a hero's welcome in his home state and issued his {{resignation}} from the Army, which was approved on March 20, 1848. His military exploits elevated his popularity in New Hampshire, but his injuries and subsequent troubles in battle led to accusations of cowardice which would long follow him. He had demonstrated competence as a general, especially in the initial march from Vera Cruz, but his short tenure and his injury left little for historians to judge his <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> a military commander.|$|E
5|$|Robert died on 27 February 1167. William fitzStephen, one of Becket's supporters, {{wrote that}} Robert died of grief {{because he was}} unable to visit Becket in exile. He was buried in Hereford Cathedral. Robert enjoyed a good {{reputation}} on the continent, for his knowledge and teaching <b>ability,</b> <b>as</b> well as for his personal qualities. Before his appointment to Hereford, John of Salisbury had praised him, but Robert's conduct during the Becket controversy soured John's attitude towards his old teacher.|$|E
5|$|Singers {{and players}} admired Britten's conducting, and David Webster rated it highly enough {{to offer him}} the musical {{directorship}} of the Covent Garden Opera in 1952. Britten declined; he was not confident of his <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> a conductor and was reluctant to {{spend too much time}} performing rather than composing. As a conductor, Britten's repertory included Purcell, Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Schubert, and occasional less characteristic choices including Schumann's Scenes from Goethe's Faust; Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius and Introduction and Allegro; Holst's Egdon Heath and short pieces by Percy Grainger.|$|E

5|$|The early 1970s saw {{a wave of}} singer-songwriters {{who drew}} on the introspective, deeply {{emotional}} and personal lyrics of 1960s folk-rock. They included James Taylor, Carole King and others, all known just as much for their lyric <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> for their performances. The same period saw the rise of bluesy Southern rock and country rock groups like the Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd. In the 1970s, soft rock developed, a kind of simple, unobtrusive and mellow form of pop-rock, exemplified {{by a number of}} bands like America and Bread, most of whom are little remembered today; many were one-hit wonders. In addition, harder arena rock bands like Chicago and Styx also saw some major success.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to previous installments, focusing on combo-based combat with the player's main weapon—the Blades of Exile—and secondary weapons acquired during the game. It uses quick time events, where the player acts in a timed sequence to defeat strong enemies and bosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing <b>ability</b> <b>as</b> alternative combat options, and the game features puzzles and platforming elements. Compared with previous installments, God of War III offers a revamped magic system, more onscreen enemies, new camera angles, and downloadable content.|$|E
