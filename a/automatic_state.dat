60|$|Ursula {{felt her}} heart fail inside her. Why must she grasp all this, why must she force {{learning}} on fifty-five reluctant children, having all the time an ugly, rude jealousy behind her, ready to throw her to {{the mercy of the}} herd of children, who would like to rend her as a weaker representative of authority. A great dread of her task possessed her. She saw Mr. Brunt, Miss Harby, Miss Schofield, all the school-teachers, drudging unwillingly at the graceless task of compelling many children into one disciplined, mechanical set, reducing the whole set to an <b>automatic</b> <b>state</b> of obedience and attention, and then of commanding their acceptance of various pieces of knowledge. The first great task was to reduce sixty children to one state of mind, or being. This state must be produced automatically, through the will of the teacher, and the will of the whole school authority, imposed upon the will of the children. The point was that the headmaster and the teachers should have one will in authority, which should bring the will of the children into accord. But the headmaster was narrow and exclusive. The will of the teachers could not agree with his, their separate wills refused to be so subordinated. So there was a state of anarchy, leaving the final judgment to the children themselves, which authority should exist.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{the fate}} of {{district}} winners varies widely from state to state. In some larger states such as Pennsylvania, New York, and California, the district winners advance to one of many sectional tournaments. The winners of each sectional tournament then advance to a state or divisional tournament, the latter only being held in Texas and California and {{are similar to the}} state tournaments held in less densely populated states. Most smaller states lack competition at the sectional level and go straight from district to state tournaments. A handful of states are composed of only one district, and the district champion is the <b>automatic</b> <b>state</b> champion.|$|E
50|$|For the {{learning}} and recall associated with spontaneous recovery to happen, there are specific gyri and neurotransmitters that play a role. Firstly, the cerebellum {{is needed to}} acquire certain motor skills and develop an <b>automatic</b> <b>state</b> with the movement patterns that are learned. Both the dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortex {{has been shown to}} play a big {{role in the development of}} memory consolidation and motor control. Reciprocal loops are formed through neural circuits between the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex which consolidate the memory. To elicit a stronger consolidation, rewards can be involved; the case for Pavlovian conditioning. The reward-related learning causes dopamine to release from the synapses of the basal ganglia and creates a stronger bond between the stimulus and response. Furthermore, if there is a traumatic incident that is associated to a memory, and that becomes suppressed, the amygdala is responsible for this fear conditioning. The amygdala leads to the caudate nucleus in the neocortex of the basal ganglia, so the fear response can also be triggered via spontaneous recovery. Basically, the stronger the emotional arousal after a learning event, positive or negative, can greatly enhance the memory's recall in the future.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{required}} {{learning time}} and curse of dimensionality restrict {{the applicability of}} Reinforcement Learning(RL) on real robots. Difficulty in inclusion of initial knowledge and understanding the learned rules must {{be added to the}} mentioned problems. In this paper we address <b>automatic</b> <b>state</b> abstraction and creation of hierarchies in RL agent’s mind, as two major approaches for reducing the number of learning trials, simplifying inclusion of prior knowledge, and making the learned rules more abstract and understandable. We formalize <b>automatic</b> <b>state</b> abstraction and hierarchy creation as an optimization problem and derive a new algorithm that adapts decision tree learning techniques to state abstraction. The proof of performance is supported by strong evidences from simulation results in nondeterministic environments. Simulation results show encouraging enhancements in the required number of learning trials, agent’s performance, size of the learned trees, and computation time of the algorithm...|$|E

40|$|A key {{challenge}} {{in the development of}} the Internet is to simplify construction of scalable widearea services. One approach to scaling wide-area services is to deploy generic computing power and storage in the network, and use it to absorb service load through dynamic resource recruitment, active caching, or dynamic service replication. Each of these approaches introduces distributed state and an accompanying burden on the programmer to manage that state. This paper develops an approach to <b>automatic</b> <b>state</b> management for replicated services, a key step toward the goal of automatically converting unscalable service implementations into scalable ones. We demonstrate a prototype implementation of <b>automatic</b> <b>state</b> management, called Ivory. Ivory transforms the bytecodes of a Java-based service to trap updates to its data structures and propagate modified objects among to peer replicas. We demonstrate our approach in the context of a service caching framework that replicates service code and data on demand, and present measurements of an example Web portal application that shows the overhead and scalability benefits of service replication using Ivory...|$|E

These requirements are fulfilled when using the concept of logical execution time, a time-triggered ap-proach.

This research focus on generating a model {{in the form of}} a state machine to recognize strings derived from the direction information of character’s images. The state machine induction process has two steps. The first step is to generate the machine from the strings of each target character (Positive Training), and the second step is to adjust the machine to reject any other string (Negative Training). This <b>automatic</b> <b>state</b> machine induction method can also be applied with any string sequence recognition in other applications...|$|E

They interleave a local lookahead search with movement execution, explore an initially unknown map, and converge to better paths over repeated experiences. In this paper, we first investigate how three known {{extensions of the}} most popular learning real-time search algorithm (LRTA*) influence its performance in a path-finding domain. Then, we combine <b>automatic</b> <b>state</b> abstraction with learning real-time search. Our scheme of dynamically building a state abstraction allows us to generalize updates to the heuristic function, thereby speeding up learning.

40|$|Abstract—Value {{function}} is usually used {{to deal with}} the reinforcement learning problems. In large or even continuous states, function approximation must be used to represent value function. Much of the current work carried out, however, has to design the structure of function approximation in advanced which cannot be adjusted during learning. In this paper, we propose a novel function approximation called Fuzzy CMAC (FCMAC) with <b>automatic</b> <b>state</b> partition (ASP-FCMAC) to automate the structure design for FCMAC. Based on CMAC (also known as tile coding), ASP-FCMAC employs fuzzy membership function to avoid the setting of parameter in CMAC, and makes use of Bellman error to partition the state automatically so as to generate the structure of FC-MAC. Empirical results in both mountain car and RoboCup Keepaway domains demonstrate that ASP-FCMAC can automatically generate the structure of FCMAC and agent using it can learn efficiently...|$|E
