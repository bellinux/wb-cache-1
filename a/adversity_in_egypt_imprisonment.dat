40|$|Background: It {{has been}} argued that the {{association}} between job strain and health could be confounded by early life exposures, and studies have shown early adversity to increase individual vulnerability to later stress. We therefore investigated if early life exposure to adversity increases the individual’s physiological vulnerability job strain in adulthood. Methodology/Principal Findings: In a population-based cohort (343 women and 330 men, 83 % of the eligible participants), we examined the association between on the one hand exposure to <b>adversity</b> <b>in</b> adolescence, measured at age 16, and job strain measured at age 43, {{and on the other hand}} allostatic load at age 43. Adversity was operationalised as an index comprising residential mobility and crowding, parental loss, parental unemployment, and parental physical and mental illness (including substance abuse). Allostatic load summarised body fat, blood pressure, inflammatory markers, glucose, blood lipids, and cortisol regulation. There was an interaction between <b>adversity</b> <b>in</b> adolescence and job strain (B = 0. 09, 95 % CI 0. 02 to 0. 16 after adjustment for socioeconomic status), particularly psychological demands, indicating that job strain was associated with increased allostatic load only among participants with <b>adversity</b> <b>in</b> adolescence. Job strain was associated with lower allostatic load in men (b = 20. 20, 95 % CI 20. 35 to 20. 06). Conclusions/Significance: Exposure to <b>adversity</b> <b>in</b> adolescence was associated with increased levels of biological stres...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The goal of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} whether exposure to <b>adversity</b> <b>in</b> childhood contributes to a differential threshold at which stressful life events provoke depressive reactions in adolescence. In addition, to address empirical and conceptual questions about stress effects, the moderating effect of anxiety disorder history was also ex-plored. This examination was conducted in a sample of 816 children of depressed and nondepressed mothers, who were followed from birth to age 15. Information on <b>adversities</b> experienced <b>in</b> childhood was collected both from moth-ers during the first five years of their youth’s life and from the youths themselves at age 15, and included information on the mother’s relationship with her partner, maternal psy-chopathology, as well as youth-reported abuse. Results indi-cated that youths with both greater exposure to <b>adversity</b> <b>in</b> childhood and a history of an anxiety disorder displayed in-creased depressive severity following low levels of episodic stress compared to youths with only one or neither of these risk factors. The results are speculated to reflect the possi-bility that early anxiety disorders associated with exposure to <b>adversity</b> <b>in</b> childhood may be a marker of dysregulated stress responses, and may help to account for the comorbidity of depression and anxiety in some individuals...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} related {{diagnostic}} information and <b>adversity</b> <b>in</b> childhood to criminal careers {{and risk of}} recidivism. Notably, ADHD and conduct disorder in childhood, schizophrenia, sexual abuse and physical abuse {{have been associated with}} offences in adulthood. This study investigates these variables in relation to large cohorts of offenders with learning disabilities. A case note review was undertaken for 126 individuals referred but not accepted into forensic learning disability services and 197 individuals accepted for such services. Results are reported on diagnostic information and experience of <b>adversity</b> <b>in</b> childhood. ADHD/conduct disorder featured prominently in both groups. Autistic spectrum disorders were not particularly over-represented. For <b>adversity</b> <b>in</b> childhood, general socioeconomic deprivation featured prominently in both groups. This also increased significantly for those accepted into services. Sexual abuse and non-accidental injury were featured at around 13 - 20 % for both groups. These results are broadly consistent with the mainstream literature on offending, ADHD/conduct disorder and general deprivation featuring significantly in all groups and rising for those accepted into offender services. It is important to deal with these aspects during assessment and to provide appropriate psychotherapeutic services for these individuals...|$|R
