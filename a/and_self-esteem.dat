5|$|Counseling {{about sex}} and {{sexuality}} by medical professionals, psychologists, social workers, and nurses {{is a part of}} most SCI rehabilitation programs. Education is part of the follow-up treatment for people with SCI, as are psychotherapy, peer mentorship, and social activities; these are helpful for improving skills needed for socializing and relationships. Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem, appropriate sexual rehabilitation care takes into account the individual as a whole, for example addressing issues with relationships <b>and</b> <b>self-esteem.</b> Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression and stress, and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity. Education includes information about birth control or assistive devices such as those for positioning in sex, or advice and ideas for addressing problems such as incontinence and autonomic dysreflexia.|$|E
5|$|Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, {{analyzed}} {{the events in}} Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept <b>and</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine whether {{collective}} <b>and</b> personal <b>self-esteem</b> serve as mediators {{in the relationship between}} perceived discrimination and subjective well-being among Chinese rural-to-urban migrant adolescents. Six hundred and ninety-two adolescents completed a perceived discrimination scale, a collective self-esteem scale, a personal <b>self-esteem</b> scale, <b>and</b> a subjective well-being scale. Structural equation modeling was used to test the mediation hypothesis. The analysis indicated that both collective <b>and</b> personal <b>self-esteem</b> partially mediated the relationship between perceived discrimination and subjective well-being. The final model also revealed a significant path from perceived discrimination through collective <b>and</b> personal <b>self-esteem</b> to subjective well-being. These findings contribute {{to the understanding of the}} complicated relationships among perceived discrimination, collective <b>and</b> personal <b>self-esteem,</b> <b>and</b> subjective well-being. The findings suggest that collective <b>and</b> personal <b>self-esteem</b> are possible targets for interventions aimed at improving subjective well-being. Programs to nurture both the personal <b>and</b> collective <b>self-esteem</b> of migrant adolescents may help to weaken the negative relationships between perceived discrimination and subjective well-being...|$|R

40|$|Present {{research}} was conducted with the purpose to study the effectiveness of behavioural intervention program in enhancing the <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> collective <b>self-esteem</b> among adolescents.

A self-structured behavioural intervention program was administered for three months to enhance low level of <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> low level of collective self-esteem among subjects. In the interventional program, teachers and parents were requested to cooperate. Pre- and post-test design was used. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was applied to test the significance of difference between pre-intervention scores and post-intervention scores of <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> collective <b>self-esteem.</b> The {{results showed that the}} mean self-esteem score in pre-measure was 11. 31, which increased to 17. 42 in post measure and Z value was - 7. 51 that was significant at. 01 level.

Further, the results showed that the mean collective self-esteem score was 34. 73 in pre-intervention measure which increased to 53. 47 in post-intervention measure. The obtained Z value for collective self-esteem was - 7. 57 that was also significant at. 01 level. It suggests that there is significant difference between pre-intervention collective <b>self-esteem</b> scores <b>and</b> post-intervention collective <b>self-esteem</b> scores.

40|$|Implicit <b>and</b> {{explicit}} <b>self-esteem</b> {{are assumed}} to be important factors in understanding the onset and maintenance of psychological problems. The current study aims to examine the association between implicit <b>and</b> explicit <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> their interaction with depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation and loneliness. Specifically, the relationship between the size and the direction of the discrepancy between implicit <b>and</b> explicit <b>self-esteem</b> with depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation and loneliness were examined. Participants were 95 young female adults (M= 21. 2 years, SD = 1. 88) enrolled in higher education. We administered the IAT to assess implicit <b>self-esteem,</b> <b>and</b> the Rosenberg <b>self-esteem</b> scale to measure explicit self-esteem while psychological problems were assessed through self-reports. Results showed that discrepancies between implicit <b>and</b> explicit <b>self-esteem</b> were positively associated with depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and loneliness. In addition, the direction of the discrepancy was specifically relevant: damaged self-esteem (i. e., high implicit <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> low explicit <b>self-esteem)</b> was consistently associated with increased levels of depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and loneliness. In contrast, defensive or fragile self-esteem (i. e., low implicit <b>and</b> high explicit <b>self-esteem)</b> was solely associated with loneliness. These findings provide further support that specifically damaged self-esteem is an important vulnerability marker for depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and loneliness...|$|R

Explicit self-esteem was measured with Rosenberg <b>Self-Esteem</b> Scale (RSES) <b>and</b> explicit self-compassion was measured with Self- Compassion Scale (SCS). <b>Self-esteem</b> IAT <b>and</b> self-compassion IAT were developed to measure implicit <b>self-esteem</b> <b>and</b> implicit self-compassion. Regression analysis was performed to analyze which components and to what extent contribute to the congruence of explicit <b>and</b> implicit <b>self-esteem.</b> It was found that explicit selfcompassion predicted greater congruence between explicit <b>and</b> implicit <b>self-esteem,</b> implicit self-compassion did not have a significant effect. Also high self-efficacy predicted greater congruence between explicit <b>and</b> implicit <b>self-esteem.</b> It can be concluded, that self-compassion has a separate role in optimal self-esteem that cannot be described by the role of self-efficacy, as both self-compassion and self-efficacy independently predicted greater congruence between explicit <b>and</b> implicit <b>self-esteem...</b>|$|R
