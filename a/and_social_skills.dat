With this design, the questions of whether the relationship between media literacy <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> levels of the eighth grade primary school students differs significantly according to gender, having access to internet; as well as {{whether there is a}} relationship between media literacy <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> levels are tried to be answered. This study is based on correlative survey model among general survey models. The study group consists of 947 eighth grade primary school students who study at the schools selected randomly from five different educational areas in the city center of Elazığ. Economical conditions and family profiles were considered in selection of those schools. In the study, two different assessment scales have been used to receive students’ opinions. One of them is the “Level Determination Scale for Media Literacy” which was developed by Karaman ve Karataş (2009) and the other one is the “Social Skill Inventory”, as translated into Turkish by Galip Yüksel in 2004, which was developed by Riggio in 1989. The study has showed {{that there is not a}} significant relationship between media literacy level <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> level. Considering the relationship according to the sub-factors, it is observed that there is a relationship between some sub-factors; however this relationship is very weak. It is observed that gender of the students does not form a significant difference for media literacy but it does for <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> level. Furthermore, female students’ <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> levels are found to be higher.

25|$|Despite the {{validity}} of previous findings, some researchers still question whether EI – job performance correlation makes a real impact on business strategies. They argue that popularity of emotional intelligence’s studies is due to media advertising, rather than objective scientific findings. Also, it is mentioned that relationship between job performance and EI is {{not as strong as}} suggested. This relationship requires the presence of other constructs to rise important outcomes. For instance, previous studies found that EI is positively associated with teamwork effectiveness under job contexts of high managerial work demands, which improves job performance. This is due to activation of strong emotions during performance on this job context. In this scenario, emotional intelligent individuals show a better set of resources to succeed on their roles. However, individuals with high EI show a similar level of performance than non-emotional intelligent employees under different job contexts. Moreover, Joseph and Newman (2010) suggested that emotional perception and emotional regulation components of EI highly contribute to job performance under job contexts of high emotional demands. Moon and Hur (2011) found that emotional exhaustion (“burn-out”) significantly influences the job performance – EI relationship. Emotional exhaustion showed a negative association with two components of EI (optimism <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>skills).</b> This association impacted negatively to job performance, as well. Hence, job performance – EI relationship is stronger under contexts of high emotional exhaustion or burn-out; in other words, employees with high levels of optimism <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> possess better resources to outperform when facing high emotional exhaustion contexts.|$|E

25|$|There {{is no one}} {{treatment}} {{proven to}} be effective {{for all types of}} aphasias. The reason that there is no universal treatment for aphasia is {{because of the nature of}} the disorder and the various ways it is presented, as explained in the above sections. Aphasia is rarely exhibited identically, implying that treatment needs to be catered specifically to the individual. Studies have shown that, although there is no consistency on treatment methodology in literature, there is a strong indication that treatment in general has positive outcomes. Therapy for aphasia ranges from increasing functional communication to improving speech accuracy, depending on the person's severity, needs and support of family and friends. Group therapy allows individuals to work on their pragmatic and communication skills with other individuals with aphasia, which are skills that may not often be addressed in individual one-on-one therapy sessions.

The Social-Emotional Educational Leadership Factor (SELF) survey was completed by 27 Indiana public elementary school principals and 30 Indiana public elementary school teachers to analyze the perceptions of the principals’ <b>social</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>skills.</b> Results showed that principals’ self perceptions of their <b>social</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>skills</b> predicted 49 % of the variability of how they perceived their skills affecting their school’s academic success (R =. 70, p <. 01). A larger 57 % of the variability was predicted from teachers’ perceptions of how their principal’s <b>social</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>skills</b> affected their school’s academic success (R =. 76, p <. 01), while principals’ self perceptions of their <b>social</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>skills</b> predicted 33 % of the variance in iv student attendance rates. Results also indicated that principals and their teachers differed on their perceptions of principals’ skills (Wilk’s λ =. 33, p <. 001), as principals’ self evaluations of <b>social</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>skills</b> were consistently more positive than the teachers’ evaluations of their principal’s <b>social</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>skills.</b> It was determined that teachers’ perceptions of their principal’s <b>social</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>skills</b> predicted 82 % of the variability of their assessment regarding their principals’ overall leadership abilities.
