Finding Fumito in the building's basement, she also finds Kuroto with him, before succumbing to a drug given by Kuroto. Fumito and Kuroto were working together, with each killing the others' families {{to take control of}} Tower and Seventh Heaven, and Saya also learns that the Elder Bairn who tried to kill Mana was Mana's father. Fumito reveals he intends to dissolve Shrovetide with Saya's help as the ratio of humans to Elder Bairns has shifted drastically due to the Elder Bairn seemingly dying out. When Kuroto attempts to kill him for abandoning his role, Fumito stabs him with a phial of Saya's blood, transforming Kuroto into <b>an</b> <b>Elder</b> Bairn seed. As Saya recovers from the drug, Fumito fuses with the seed, which hatches into a giant Elder Bairn which Saya slays.

5|$|Andriamanelo was {{the oldest}} son of the reigning Vazimba queen (alternately given in the oral {{histories}} as Rafohy or Rangita) and her Hova husband Manelobe, who may have had origins in the Zafiraminia people of Anosy. At {{the time of the}} marriage between Rafohy and Manelobe, the Hova were a minority clan who had recently moved into the Vazimba-dominated highlands from their ancestral homeland in the southeast. The marriage produced two sons, Andriamanelo and his younger brother Andriamananitany, as well as a sister named Rafotsindrindramanjaka. In a bid to counteract further fracturing of their kingdom, Rafohy and Rangita decided that while the Vazimba had historically been ruled by queens, Andriamanelo would inherit the crown upon his mother's death and would be succeeded not by his own child but by his younger brother. This system of succession, ordered by the queens to be followed for all time, was called fanjakana arindra ("organized government") and applied to families as well: in any instance where there was <b>an</b> <b>elder</b> child and a younger one, the parents would designate <b>an</b> <b>elder</b> child to assume authority within the family upon their death, and that authority would be handed to the designated younger child in the event of the death of the elder child. The queen gave the village of Alasora to Andriamanelo to rule as his territory while she still lived, while Andriamananitany was given the village of Ambohitrandriananahary.|$|E
