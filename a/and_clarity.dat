5|$|A chavrusa {{helps the}} student stay awake, keep his mind {{focused on the}} learning, sharpen his {{reasoning}} powers, develop his thoughts into words, and organize his thoughts into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision <b>and</b> <b>clarity</b> into ideas that would otherwise remain vague. Having to listen to, analyze and respond to another's opinion inculcates respect for others. It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is loathe to disappoint or cancel on his chavrusa.|$|E
40|$|The {{mediation}} {{effect of}} self-esteem {{on the relationship}} between attachment style <b>and</b> self-concept <b>clarity</b> was investigated. In Study 1, the relationship between attachment style <b>and</b> self-concept <b>clarity</b> was examined by correlation and regression analysis. Results from 189 and 85 students at National Taiwan University (NTU) showed that anxiety and avoidance attachment tendencies were negatively related with self-certainty <b>and</b> self-concept <b>clarity.</b> In Study 2, self-esteem was included to determine whether the negative relation between attachment tendency <b>and</b> self-concept <b>clarity</b> was mediated by self-esteem. Participants were 123 NTU students. The mediation effect of self-esteem {{on the relationship between}} attachment tendency <b>and</b> self-concept <b>clarity</b> was supported in a path model, indicating people with secure attachment have higher self-esteem, which results in greater clarity of self-concept...|$|R

40|$|Most {{theories}} of psychotic-like experiences posit {{the involvement of}} cognitive mechanisms. The current research examined the relations between psychotic-like experiences and two cognitive mechanisms, high aberrant salience <b>and</b> low self-concept <b>clarity.</b> In particular, we examined whether aberrant salience, or the incorrect assignment of importance to neutral stimuli, <b>and</b> low self-concept <b>clarity</b> interacted to predict psychotic-like experiences. The current research included three large samples (n 667, 724, 744) of participants and oversampled for increased schizotypal personality traits. In all three studies, an interaction between aberrant salience <b>and</b> self-concept <b>clarity</b> was found such that participants with high aberrant salience <b>and</b> low self-concept <b>clarity</b> had {{the highest levels of}} psychotic-like experiences. In addition, aberrant salience <b>and</b> self-concept <b>clarity</b> interacted to predict a supplemental measure of delusions in Study 2. In Study 3, in contrast to low self-concept clarity, neuroticism did not interact with aberrant salience to predict psychotic-like experiences, suggesting that the relation between low self-concept <b>clarity</b> <b>and</b> psychosis may not be a result of neuroticism. Additionally, aberrant salience <b>and</b> self-concept <b>clarity</b> did not interact to predict two other SPD criteria, social anhedonia or trait paranoia, which suggests the interaction is specific to psychotic-like experiences. Overall, our results are consistent with several cognitive models of psychosis suggesting that aberrant salience <b>and</b> self-concept <b>clarity</b> might be important mechanisms in the occurrence of psychotic-like symptoms...|$|R

5|$|Art {{director}} Jeremy Cook {{stated that}} maintaining readability <b>and</b> <b>clarity</b> {{of the units}} and combat space was highest priority of the game's art direction. He also {{wanted to make sure}} that the visual style remained consistent with the Halo universe, by ensuring that the recognisable traits of the units and structures were preserved. The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with a greater emphasis on the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Dysphagia and dysarthria: {{dysphagia}} is {{a difficulty}} with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor {{control over the}} subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A {{speech and language therapist}} may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production <b>and</b> <b>clarity,</b> and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E
5|$|In {{between these}} works he {{found time to}} write Literarum latinarum, a small {{instruction}} manual on the italic script. The italic script (or chancery cursive) reached the Low Countries from Italy {{at the beginning of}} the sixteenth century and it is recorded as a form of typescript in Leuven in 1522. It was much favoured by humanist scholars who enjoyed its elegance <b>and</b> <b>clarity</b> as well as the rapid fluency that could be attained with practice, but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes, maps and scientific instruments (which typically used Roman capitals or gothic script). Mercator first applied the italic script to the globe of Gemma Frisius and thereafter to all his works, with ever-increasing elegance. The title page of this work is an illustration of the decorative style he developed.|$|E

5|$|Recording {{sessions}} began {{shortly after}} the release of Singles in August 2000 and took place in Los Angeles, California. The sales from Singles and the proceeds from Jimmy Eat World's European tour helped fund the album's recording sessions. Bleed American was produced by Mark Trombino. Trombino had already produced two of the band's previous studio albums: Static Prevails (1996) <b>and</b> <b>Clarity</b> (1999), and also produced Blink-182's breakthrough album, Dude Ranch (1997). The money budgeted for the record was insufficient. Trombino offered to work for free during the recording sessions, confident he would be reimbursed by the album's predicted commercial success. Some of the songs included in Bleed American had already been written and recorded during the Clarity sessions, but the band felt they were recorded too late to include them in that album.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{produced}} art {{to serve}} functional purposes. For over 3500 years, artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were {{developed during the}} Old Kingdom, following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change. These artistic standards—simple lines, shapes, and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depth—created a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls, coffins, stelae, and even statues. The Narmer Palette, for example, displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs. Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision <b>and</b> <b>clarity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The most {{familiar}} uses of diamonds today are as gemstones used for adornment, a use which dates back into antiquity, and as industrial abrasives for cutting hard materials. The dispersion of white light into spectral colors {{is the primary}} gemological characteristic of gem diamonds. In the 20th century, experts in gemology developed methods of grading diamonds and other gemstones based on the characteristics most important to their value as a gem. Four characteristics, known informally as the four Cs, are now commonly used as the basic descriptors of diamonds: these are carat (its weight), cut (quality of the cut is graded according to proportions, symmetry and polish), color (how close to white or colorless; for fancy diamonds how intense is its hue), <b>and</b> <b>clarity</b> (how free is it from inclusions).

The research data is analyzed by using t-test and correlation test. The result got N-Gain score 0, 58 in cognitive assessment with medium criteria, 78, 22 in affective with nice criteria, and 84, 16 in psychomotor assessment with very nice criteria.
