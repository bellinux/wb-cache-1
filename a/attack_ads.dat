5|$|His final {{re-election}} campaign came in 1990 against businessman Harry Lonsdale. Lonsdale aggressively went after Hatfield with television <b>attack</b> <b>ads</b> that attacked Hatfield {{as out of}} touch {{on issues such as}} abortion and timber management and accused the incumbent of being too closely allied with special interest groups in Washington. Lonsdale's tactics moved him even with, and then ahead of Hatfield in some polls. Hatfield, who had typically stayed above the fray of negative campaigning, was forced to respond in kind with <b>attack</b> <b>ads</b> of his own. He raised $1million in a single month after trailing Lonsdale in the polls before the November election. He defeated the Democrat with 590,095 (53.7percent) votes to 507,743 (46.2percent) votes.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Rice {{was criticized}} in <b>attack</b> <b>ads</b> for his support, {{as mayor of}} Glendale, {{of the use of}} Mexican-issued matricula {{consular}} cards as legal forms of identification for use by immigrants. In his campaign, Rice outlined his top legislative priorities as public safety, economic security, and quality of life. Rice was regarded by both conservative and liberal observers as a moderate Democrat, {{and is a member of}} the centrist Democratic Leadership Council.|$|E

5|$|Martin's weak {{performance}} in the leader's debate, along with an unpopular provincial budget by Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty in Ontario, moved the Conservatives into a lead for a time. However, comments by Conservative MPs, leaked press releases slandering the then prime minister, as well as controversial TV <b>attack</b> <b>ads</b> suggesting that the Conservatives would make Canada more like the United States, caused Harper's party to lose some momentum.|$|E
5|$|After Smith's {{departure}} from the company for soft drinks producer PepsiCo in 1980, the company began to see a system-wide decline in sales. Pillsbury {{executive vice president of}} restaurant operations Norman E. Brinker was tasked with turning the brand around and strengthening its position against its main rival, McDonald's. One of his first acts was to initiate an advertising plan emphasizing claims that Burger King's flame-broiled burgers were better and larger than its rival's. The program, arguably the first <b>attack</b> <b>ads</b> on a food chain by a competitor, was controversial in that before it fast food ads only made allusions to the competition without ever mentioning them by name. McDonald's sued Burger King, their ad agency at the time J. Walter Thompson. The child actress Sarah Michelle Gellar was also implicated in the lawsuit because of her appearance in these television commercials. The suit was settled the following year on undisclosed terms. Despite the controversy, the ad plan, dubbed the Burger Wars, boosted same store sales. Brinker continued working for the company in this capacity until 1982 when he was promoted to president of Pillsbury's food service division, which included the company's other chains beyond Burger King. Brinker left the company in 1984 to take the helm at Dallas-based gourmet burger chain Chili's.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 U.S. Senate {{election}} in Massachusetts, Kennedy faced his first serious challenger, the young, telegenic, and very well-funded Mitt Romney. Romney ran {{as a successful}} entrepreneur and Washington outsider with a strong family image and moderate stands on social issues, while Kennedy was saddled not only with his recent past but the 25th anniversary of Chappaquiddick and his first wife Joan seeking a renegotiated divorce settlement. By mid-September 1994, polls showed the race to be even. Kennedy's campaign ran short on money, and belying his image as endlessly wealthy, {{he was forced to}} take out a second mortgage on his Virginia home. Kennedy responded with a series of <b>attack</b> <b>ads,</b> which focused both on Romney's shifting political views and on the treatment of workers at a paper products plant owned by Romney's Bain Capital. Kennedy's new wife Vicki proved to be a strong asset in campaigning. Kennedy and Romney held a widely watched late October debate without a clear winner, but by then Kennedy had pulled ahead in polls and stayed ahead afterward. In the November election, despite a very bad outcome for the Democratic Party nationally, Kennedy won re-election by a 58percent to 41percent margin, the closest re-election race of his career.|$|E
5000|$|Petersen held a {{press conference}} on October 26 in front of Davis' {{headquarters}} in Fairfax. He said that [...] "words cannot describe the anger I feel" [...] about the flyer, and called it [...] "shocking" [...] that Davis would use his personal information in such a manner. Petersen said that advertising his personal information was not in and of itself a problem, but using his personal phone number and children's identification was not appropriate or safe in an <b>attack</b> <b>ad.</b> Such tactics, Petersen said, endangered his family. Mrs. Petersen complained of receiving two telephone calls related to the <b>attack</b> <b>ad,</b> and police presence appeared at the home, before the family vacated the house. In response, Davis said in her own press conference that because the information was public and included to supporters, it was appropriate for an <b>attack</b> <b>ad.</b>|$|R

Although he did not become involved in a presidential campaign {{to the extent that he}} did in 1984, Kamber nevertheless played a big role in the 1992 election. In July of that year, he established a political action committee called Americans for Change. The group's goal was to raise $1 million to run <b>attack</b> <b>ads</b> against President George H. W. Bush.|$|E
25|$|Running unopposed in the June primary, Bilbray overcame {{a strong}} {{challenge}} from Democrat Nick Leibham in the November 2008 general election. With {{help from the}} DCCC and $1 million in donations, Leibham ran a string of TV <b>attack</b> <b>ads</b> against Bilbray. Democrats thought {{they had a chance}} at winning the district due to the hostile environment plaguing Republicans in general, and shifting demographics locally. Bilbray won, 50% to 46%, with 4% of the vote going to Libertarian candidate Wayne Dunlap.|$|E
25|$|On September 12, 2006, Kagen, a {{first time}} candidate, won the Democratic Party {{nomination}} for Wisconsin's 8th District. The seat was left open by the four-term incumbent Republican, Mark Green, who unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Wisconsin. On November 7, Kagen narrowly defeated Wisconsin Assembly Speaker John Gard of Peshtigo {{in the most}} expensive Congressional race in Wisconsin history, a race dominated by <b>attack</b> <b>ads,</b> mainly created by third-party 527 issue ad groups, outside {{the control of the}} candidate or parties. Some of the issues where Kagen and Gard disagreed were President George W. Bush's direction in the Iraq War, stem-cell research, and tax policy.|$|E

25|$|In the 2002 primary election, Davis ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination. He {{spent his}} {{campaign}} funds on <b>attack</b> <b>ads</b> against California Secretary of State Bill Jones and Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan, the two well known moderates in the Republican primary. The {{result was that}} his opponent {{in the general election}} was conservative Republican and political newcomer Bill Simon, who was popular within his own party but unknown by the majority of the state population. The intense criticism of both candidates caused Davis and Simon to run one of the most negative campaigns in recent state history. The attacks on both sides turned off voters and suppressed turnout; Davis ultimately won with 47% of the vote. The suppressed turnout had the effect of lowering the threshold for the 2003 recall petition to qualify.|$|E
25|$|By July 2006 {{polls showed}} Fenty with a roughly 10-point advantage; {{political}} observers debated {{whether it was}} due to Fenty's door-to-door campaign, Cropp's lack of engagement in the campaign, or the electorate's desire for a new direction. Cropp's campaign began running negative <b>attack</b> <b>ads</b> during the month before the primary, painting Fenty as unfit for the job and as a careless lawyer who had been admonished by the D.C. Bar, (in 2005, he received an informal admonition from the Bar for his role in a probate case in 1999). The attacks backfired. Fenty won all 142 city precincts in the Democratic Primary—a feat unparalleled in earlier mayoral elections—defeating Cropp by a 57 to 31 percent margin. He received 89 {{percent of the vote in}} the general election and became the District's sixth elected mayor since the establishment of home rule.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to sway voter {{sentiment}} {{in the final two}} weeks of the campaign, the Liberals prepared a series of <b>attack</b> <b>ads.</b> One unreleased ad was seen widely as disrespectful of the military and it not only overshadowed the other ads but also forced Martin to defend the controversial ad instead of releasing new policies. During the last week, Martin was forced to defend Harper after the latter was called a separatist by Canadian Auto Workers union leader Buzz Hargrove. In another tactic similar to the 2004 campaign, Hargrove urged all progressive voters to unite under the Liberal banner in English Canada and the Bloc Québécois in Quebec to stop the Conservatives, hoping to attract voters who were leaning towards the NDP, but New Democrat leader Jack Layton responded by focusing his attacks on Liberal corruption.|$|E
