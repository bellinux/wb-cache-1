25|$|Regular {{physical}} exercise {{with or without}} physiotherapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life. In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for patients experiencing rigidity, generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking {{have been found to}} decrease excessive muscle tension. Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk, rhythmic initiation, diaphragmatic breathing, and meditation techniques. Common changes in gait associated with the disease such as hypokinesia (slowness of movement), shuffling and decreased arm swing are addressed by a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety. Goals with respect to gait during rehabilitation programs include improving gait speed, base of support, stride length, trunk and arm swing movement. Strategies include utilizing assistive equipment (pole walking and treadmill walking), verbal cueing (manual, visual and <b>auditory),</b> <b>exercises</b> (marching and PNF patterns) and varying environments (surfaces, inputs, open vs. closed).|$|R
500|$|Exercise {{programs}} are recommended {{in people with}} Parkinson's disease. There {{is some evidence that}} speech or mobility problems can improve with rehabilitation, although studies are scarce and of low quality. Regular physical exercise with or without physical therapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life. When an exercise program is performed under the supervision of a physiotherapist, there are more improvements in motor symptoms, mental and emotional functions, daily living activities, and quality of life compared to a self-supervised exercise program at home. In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for people experiencing rigidity, generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking have been found to decrease excessive muscle tension. Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk, rhythmic initiation, diaphragmatic breathing, and meditation techniques. As for gait and addressing the challenges associated with the disease such as hypokinesia (slowness of movement), shuffling and decreased arm swing; physiotherapists have a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety. Areas of interest with respect to gait during rehabilitation programs focus on, {{but are not limited to}} improving gait speed, the base of support, stride length, trunk and arm swing movement. Strategies include utilizing assistive equipment (pole walking and treadmill walking), verbal cueing (manual, visual and <b>auditory),</b> <b>exercises</b> (marching and PNF patterns) and altering environments (surfaces, inputs, open vs. closed). Strengthening exercises have shown improvements in strength and motor function for people with primary muscular weakness and weakness related to inactivity with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease. However, reports show a significant interaction between strength and the time the medications was taken. Therefore, it is recommended that people with PD should perform exercises 45 minutes to one hour after medications when they are at their best. Also, due to the forward flexed posture, and respiratory dysfunctions in advanced Parkinson's disease, [...] deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises are beneficial in improving chest wall mobility and vital capacity. Exercise may improve constipation.|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{accounts}} of pure word meaning deafness are rare; {{accounts of}} its rehabilitation are virtually non-existent. We contrast {{the effects of}} two therapies in a patient with pure word meaning deafness. One therapy required only implicit auditory access from the patient (silent reading comprehension exercises). The second required explicit auditory access (<b>auditory</b> comprehension <b>exercises),</b> and thus appeared to be more suited to the exact locus of the patient's impairment. Improvement was observed after both types of therapy. However, improvement on implicit access therapy {{was influenced by the}} use of a compensatory strategy developed by the patient. In contrast, improvement on explicit access therapy was more durable, and appeared to be due to a direct effect on the audition-semantics link, rather than to compensation. We conclude that pure word meaning deafness is amenable to treatment, and that cognitive models can be useful in designing such therapy studies...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of the attention training technique (ATT) on the frequency of intrusive thoughts experienced by a person with schizophrenia in her daily life. The attentional procedure was designed to attenuate self-focused attention and to reinforce attentional control and consisted of <b>auditory</b> external <b>exercises.</b> Homework practice was included to promote transfer to everyday life. The efficacy and specificity of the ATT were assessed with cognitive, functional, and control measures. The impact of ATT on symptomatology, work functioning, and self-esteem was also measured. Postrehabilitation results showed that, after nine training sessions, there was a reduction in intrusive thoughts for the cognitive and ecological outcome measures. Selective attention, attention switching, and resistance to distractive interference specifically improved. The person reported a reduction in intrusive thoughts in her daily life. In addition, positive symptoms decreased. Finally, a 6 -month follow-up assessment revealed the maintenance of most of the beneficial effects in daily life. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Male albino rats {{were trained}} on an {{adjusting}} avoidance schedule {{in which each}} lever press accumulated a given amount of shock-free time. Multiple auditory and visual stimuli were programmed for each discrete temporal distance from the shock {{in an effort to}} place the avoidance behavior {{under the control of the}} shock proximity. The effects of the stimuli were further examined by presenting part of them and then by removing them altogether. With the combined auditory and visual stimuli, the rat spent most of the time relatively close to the shock and usually started to respond only when the shock was near. With the visual stimuli only, the rat kept the shock at intermediate temporal distances and responded more variably. The behavior with the auditory stimuli alone was quite similar to that produced by the combined stimuli, thus indicating that the <b>auditory</b> stimuli <b>exercised</b> the greater control. When all stimuli were removed, the animal usually kept the shock as far away as the procedure permitted. When only a single pre-shock stimulus was presented, the rat remained quite close to the shock and started to respond predominantly in the pre-shock step...|$|R

40|$|Even though <b>auditory</b> {{training}} <b>exercises</b> {{for humans}} {{have been shown}} to improve certain perceptual skills of individuals with and without hearing loss, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge pertaining to which aspects of training are responsible for the perceptual gains, and which aspects of perception are changed. To better define how auditory training impacts brain and behavior, electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have been used to determine the time course and coincidence of cortical modulations associated with different types of training. Here we focus on P 1 -N 1 -P 2 auditory evoked responses (AEP), as there are consistent reports of gains in P 2 amplitude following various types of auditory training experiences; including music and speech-sound training. The purpose of this experiment was to determine if the auditory evoked P 2 response is a biomarker of learning. To do this, we taught native English speakers to identify a new pre-voiced temporal cue that is not used phonemically in the English language so that coinciding changes in evoked neural activity could be characterized. To differentiate possible effects of repeated stimulus exposure and a button-pushing task from learning itself, we examined modulations in brain activity in a group of participants who learned to identify the pre-voicing contrast and compared it to participants, matched in time, and stimulus exposure, that did not. The main finding was that the amplitude of the P 2 auditory evoked response increased across repeated EEG sessions for all groups, regardless of any change in perceptual performance. What's more, these effects are retained for months. Changes in P 2 amplitude were attributed to changes in neural activity associated with the acquisition process and not the learned outcome itself. A further finding was the expression of a late negativity (LN) wave 600 - 900 ms post-stimulus onset, post-training exclusively for the group that learned to identify the pre-voiced contrast. © 2014 Tremblay, Ross, Inoue, McClannahan and Collet.

2500|$|Unusual {{responses}} to sensory stimuli {{are more common}} and prominent in children with autism, although there is not good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Several therapies {{have been developed to}} treat Sensory processing disorder. Some of these treatments (for example, sensorimotor handling) have a questionable rationale and have no empirical evidence. Other treatments have been studied, with small positive outcomes, but few conclusions can be drawn due to methodological problems with the studies. These treatments include prism lenses, physical <b>exercise,</b> <b>auditory</b> integration training, and sensory stimulation or inhibition techniques such as [...] "deep pressure"—firm touch pressure applied either manually or via an apparatus such as a hug machine or a pressure garment. Weighted vests, a popular deep-pressure therapy, have only a limited amount of scientific research available, which on balance indicates that the therapy is ineffective. Although replicable treatments have been described and valid outcome measures are known, gaps exist in knowledge related to Sensory processing disorder and therapy. In a 2011 Cochrane review, no evidence was found to support the use of auditory integration training as an ASD treatment method. Because empirical support is limited, systematic evaluation is needed if these interventions are used.|$|R
40|$|The project {{completed}} at the Wichita State University Department of Physical Therapy. Presented at the 3 rd Annual Capitol Graduate Research Summit, Topeka, KS, 2006 A paucity of studies exist that examines {{the effects of}} the behavior modification approach for the treatment of autism using the following therapeutic treatments: Discrete Trial Training; Picture Exchange Communication program (PECS); Brain Gym; and Balance <b>Auditory,</b> Vision and <b>Exercises</b> program (Bal-A-Vis-X) on motor performance and imitation skills of children with autism. An exploratory study was performed by Rainbows United Inc. (RUI) based on a combination of these treatments (i. e., eclectic approach) which emphasizes blending the strengths of these intervention strategies to meet the individual needs of each child. Seven children (3 - 4 yrs) with autism participated in a 11 -mos, 1 - 8 sessions/mos, 2 ½ hour therapy session program. The 150 minute therapy session began with 60 minutes of PECS, Brain Gym, and Bal-A-Vis-X. This was followed by eight, 10 minute sessions of the following therapy: occupational therapy, speech therapy, academic skills, work box, structure play, self care, artistic skills, and physical therapy. The eight, 10 minute therapy sessions were 1 : 1 (i. e., child with therapist) while the 60 minute sessions were group sessions (i. e., 3 - 7 children). Data analysis was done using percent changes. There were no consistent improvements demonstrated by the children. Indeed, the percent of completed attempts in imitation continued to cycle from high to low throughout the study. The varied amount of shortcomings in methodology were addressed focusing on inconsistencies in task selectivity, task frequency, and testing environment...|$|R
40|$|Background: Impairments in gait {{coordination}} may be {{a factor}} in falls and mobility limitations after stroke. Therefore, rehabilitation targeting lower limb coordination {{may be a}} mechanistic way to improve walking post-stroke. This review sought to examine what treatments currently exist to target impairments of gait coordination, the theoretical basis on which they are derived and the potential efficacy of such interventions. Review Objectives: This review sought to determine the effectiveness of current interventions in improving coordination of axial segments and lower limbs following stroke and to examine any evidence to indicate whether improvements in locomotor performance can be brought about using interventions for the restoration of deficits in motor coordination. To address this objective we sought to examine the best available evidence in regards to therapeutic interventions for stroke subjects to improve: Coordination of axial segments (head, trunk and pelvis) and stepping patterns during walking.; Coordination of axial segments (head, trunk and pelvis) and stepping patterns specifically while turning during walking. Inclusion Criteria: We included studies investigating effects of a physiotherapeutic intervention on gait coordination in participants with stroke, regardless of lesion location or time since stroke. We included study designs such as; randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials, case-control studies, cohort studies, in order to compare evidence for the effect of treatment on gait coordination compared to no treatment. Studies were required to include at least one outcome measure of gait co-ordination. Search Strategy: The search strategy, conducted in the timeframe of 1980 to September Week 1, 2009 used a combination of controlled vocabulary (MeSH) and free text terms, was limited to English papers with human participants and was used for MEDLINE and modified to suit other databases (CINAHL, AMED,EMBASE, PEDro and Cochrane Databases). Critical appraisal: Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of selected studies using {{a modified version of the}} Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for cohort/case control. For rigour and detail, additional questions from Downs and Black’s checklist were added. Data extraction: Two authors independently extracted means and standard deviations from each outcome measure as well as participant demographics and details of the trial design. Data synthesis: Due to the range of study designs included we limited the influence of heterogeneity in experimental design and control comparators by restricting meta-analyses to pre- and post- test comparisons of experimental interventions only. In this way we obtained an estimate of the effect of interventions compared to no treatment. Results: Few high quality RCTs with a low risk of bias specifically targeting and measuring restoration of coordinated gait were found. Nine RCTs and 24 quasi-experimental studies were included. Four main intervention types that directly target gait coordination impairments were identified: task specific locomotor training (including over ground and treadmill training with or without body weight support), ankle foot orthotics and functional electrical stimulation, <b>auditory</b> cueing and <b>exercise.</b> Overall, the interventions improved both coordination and gait function (speed). When considered individually each type of intervention also improved gait function (speed) but for co-ordination, the only intervention to show a significant benefit was auditory cueing. Conclusions: The fact that overall improvements in gait coordination were found to coincide with increased walking speed lends support to the hypothesis that rehabilitation targeted at gait coordination gait may be a mechanistic way of improving overall walking ability post-stroke...|$|R
