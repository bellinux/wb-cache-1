25|$|Both Matthews and Cuthbert {{won their}} heats with Matthews setting an Olympic record of 11.5seconds in hers. Cuthbert broke that {{record in the}} {{following}} heat {{with a time of}} 11.4seconds. The world record of 11.3 was held by another Australian, Shirley Strickland who was eliminated in her heat. In the final Matthews felt she got a bad start and was last at the 50metre mark. Cuthbert sensed Isabella Daniels from the USA close behind her <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> little extra to win Australia’s first gold at the Games in a time of 11.5seconds, Matthews was third. The result was repeated in the 200m final. Cuthbert won her second gold breaking Marjorie Jackson’s Olympic record. Mathews was third again.|$|E
500|$|In a third incident, {{a disgruntled}} {{constituent}} {{walked into his}} office, with a gun drawn and reportedly said [...] "Don Chafin, I'm gonna' shoot you dead." [...] Chafin reached into his desk drawer <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> pistol of his own, and said, [...] "Go ahead. [...] We'll hop into Hell together." [...] The man left without firing a shot.|$|E
500|$|General Prem Chand was {{particularly}} anxious about Bunche's visit. Keenly aware of this, Bunche {{did his best}} to alleviate the general's worries, asking to stay at his residence in Élisabethville instead of a hotel. Prem Chand was alarmed when Bunche presented him with a letter from Thant, but Bunche reached into his pocket <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> suggested response. The general was surprised by the accuracy of the draft in its considerations of the military situation of UN troops during the advance, though the following day he gave Bunche a full explanation of what had occurred. In his official report on the events in Katanga, Bunche concluded, [...] "I have found beyond doubt that it is our machinery that is at fault, far more than the individuals." [...] He returned to UN Headquarters on 10 January with an official apology from ONUC commanders. Thant later commented on the matter, writing, [...] "I felt that it was I, not they, who should have apologised for my miscalculation and apprehensions based on scare reports from London and Brussels." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{town meeting}} {{attracted}} a packed crowd of over a thousand, with Nixon supporters distributing anti-Voorhis literature at the door. The Senate proxies spoke first for their candidates, followed by Voorhis. Nixon, who had notified organizers {{that he would}} be late due to another commitment, arrived during Voorhis's speech, and remained backstage until the congressman had completed his talk. He then came onstage, shook hands with Voorhis, and delivered a fifteen-minute address. A question-and-answer period then followed, with a Nixon supporter asking Voorhis about his onetime Socialist registration, and about his views on monetary policy. [...] After the representative responded, a Voorhis supporter asked Nixon why he was making [...] "false charges" [...] about the supposed Voorhis CIO-PAC endorsement. [...] In response, Nixon reached into his pocket <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> copy of a Southern California NCPAC bulletin mentioning the group's endorsement of Voorhis. [...] The congressman was unaware of the endorsement; those of his aides in the know had [...] "completely forgotten" [...] to tell him. [...] Nixon walked halfway across the stage and displayed it to Voorhis, asking him to read it for himself. Voorhis came from his seat and took it, and (according to Bullock, who served as timekeeper at the debate) [...] "mumbled" [...] that this seemed to be a different organization from the CIO-PAC. [...] Nixon reclaimed the document, and began to read out names {{of the members of the}} boards of directors of the two groups, [...] "It's the same thing, virtually, when they have the same directors." [...] The crowd began to cheer Nixon, who later wrote, [...] "I could tell by the audience reaction that I had made my point", and to jeer Voorhis, who wrote, [...] "They'd boo and laugh at my remarks, and this disturbed me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, Holtz left Minnesota to {{take over}} the then-struggling Notre Dame Fighting Irish {{football}} program. A taskmaster and strict disciplinarian, Holtz had the names removed from the backs of the players' jerseys when he took over at Notre Dame, wanting to emphasize team effort. Except for the 1988 Cotton Bowl Classic against Texas A, the 2008 Hawaii Bowl, the 2010 Sun Bowl against Miami, the 2012 BCS National Championship Game against Alabama, [...] and the 2013 Pinstripe Bowl, names have not been included on Notre Dame's team jerseys since. Although his 1986 squad posted an identical 5–6 mark that the 1985 edition had, five of their six losses were by a combined total of 14 points. [...] In the season finale against the archrival USC Trojans, Notre Dame overcame a 17-point fourth-quarter deficit <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> 38–37 win over the stunned Southern Cal team.|$|E
2500|$|During Jigglypuff's first {{appearance}} ("The Song of Jigglypuff"), {{it was found}} standing on a stump. Misty tried to capture it {{with the help of}} her Staryu, but felt bad when the Jigglypuff started crying. They soon realised that Jigglypuff was upset because it could not sing, and after a series of failed vocal exercises, Brock gave it a piece of fruit which soothed its throat. Now capable of singing, it performed for them, putting everyone within hearing range to sleep. This upset Jigglypuff, which angrily dug into Ash's backpack <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> marker which it used to draw on the faces of everyone who fell asleep. Only on two occasions has Jigglypuff believed that anyone had heard its song to the end: in the first, Jigglypuff realizes that Misty's Psyduck was sleeping with its eyes open, and in the second ("A Poké-Block Party"), a Whismur had heard the song the first time and stayed awake due to its Soundproof ability, but on the second time it was tired and fell asleep. In [...] "The Ancient Puzzle of Pokémopolis", Jigglypuff sang to two gigantic Pokémon battling each other, but these two Pokémon did not fall asleep, and instead Jigglypuff was knocked away by the energy of their battle. In the Pokémon short Pikachu's Exploration Club, Jigglypuff is parodied by a Marill, which, in the same fashion, puffs up angrily after putting its audience into sleep with its song. In Pokémon Chronicles, Marina has a Jigglypuff, but when the Jigglypuff uses Sing, people are not affected in part because of Beedrill, whose beating wings are too loud.|$|E
