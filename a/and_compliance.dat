5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, the value would be {{determined}} by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential/margins between used and new goods would stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods. Because the U.S. tax system has a hidden effect on prices, it is expected that moving to the FairTax would decrease production costs from the removal of business taxes <b>and</b> <b>compliance</b> costs, which is predicted to offset a portion of the FairTax effect on prices.|$|E
5|$|A diverse {{range of}} groups have raised issues, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), over the welfare of animals, {{governmental}} and social agencies over health issues <b>and</b> <b>compliance</b> with nutritional labeling laws, and unions and trade groups over labor relations and laws. These situations have touched on the concepts of animal rights, corporate responsibility and ethics, {{as well as social}} justice. While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits, in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions, dealt with statutory compliance, or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties. The resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its suppliers and franchisees or how it does business with the public.|$|E

The borough's securities industry, enumerating 163,400 jobs in August 2013, continues to form the largest segment of the city's financial sector and an important economic engine for Manhattan, accounting in 2012 for 5 percent of private sector jobs in New York City, 8.5 percent (US$3.8 billion) of the city's tax revenue, and 22 percent of the city's total wages, including an average salary of US$360,700. Wall Street investment banking fees in 2012 totaled approximately US$40 billion, while in 2013, senior New York City bank officers who manage risk <b>and</b> <b>compliance</b> functions earned as much as US$324,000 annually.|$|E
5|$|Historian Ban Zhao (45116 CE) {{wrote in}} her Lessons for Women that, like the {{opposite}} and complementary forces of yin and yang, men's great virtues were strength and rigidity, while a woman's great virtues were respect <b>and</b> <b>compliance.</b> Throughout her life, a Han woman was to bend {{to the will of}} first her father, then her husband, and then her adult son (三從四德). However, there are many recorded deviations from this rule, as some Han women are written to have engaged in heated arguments with their husbands over concubines (sometimes beating concubines out of jealousy and to punish the husband), wrote essays and letters for husbands serving as government officials, and sometimes husbands turned to their wives for advice on political affairs of the court. When a father died, the eldest son was theoretically the senior member of the family, yet as hinted in various works of Han literature, they still had to obey the will of their mother and she could even force them to kowtow to her when apologizing for an offense. Deviations from common customs regarding gender were especially pronounced in the imperial family. The empress was able to give orders to her male relatives (even her father) and if they disobeyed her, she could publicly reprimand and humiliate them.|$|E
5|$|While Final Fantasy XIII was in production, the {{development}} of Crystal Tools caused significant problems and delays. The programmers spent much time on taking all demands from staff into account. Based on this feedback, Murata's team tried to adapt the engine {{to the needs of}} several game projects, which proved to be virtually impossible and prevented the engine's specifications from being finalized. Furthermore, as separate groups were working on the individual tools of the engine, there was no comprehensive software documentation to ensure usability <b>and</b> <b>compliance.</b> Unable to wait any longer, the Final Fantasy XIII team {{had no choice but to}} begin creating assets to keep to the game's production schedule. However, the lack of specifications resulted in these assets being incompatible with the engine. In the end, it was decided that Final Fantasy XIII was to be the principal focus of Crystal Tools and the game's team began cooperating with the Research and Development Division more closely to receive the required tools and specifications. While preliminary support of Crystal Tools was developed for the Wii, the console did not fully support all components. In 2008, Murata said that Square Enix might license the engine out to other companies at some point in the future, although the limited documentation and the impracticality of supporting licensees posed great problems in doing so. Two years later, Final Fantasy XIII producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that developing an engine from scratch to go with a new game may have been a mistake and a likely cause for the long period between the title's announcement and release.|$|E

40|$|<b>Compliance</b> <b>and</b> {{noncompliance}} with maternal requests represent key milestones in children's social development. The {{objectives of}} the present study were to: (1) investigate whether maternal requests, <b>and</b> child <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> noncompliance vary according to play context, maternal request strategy, child noncompliance strategy, and child age, and (2) examine the contribution of maternal childhood histories of aggression and withdrawal to the prediction of maternal request strategies <b>and</b> child <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> noncompliance. Participants were recruited from the Concordia Longitudinal Risk Project, which began in 1977 when children in Grades 1, 4, or 7 from disadvantaged neighbourhoods were classified along dimensions of aggression and social withdrawal. Seventy-four mothers were videotaped in their homes while they interacted with their children (aged 2 to 6 years) during three play contexts: a puzzle task, a free play, and a command task. Maternal request strategies <b>and</b> child <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> noncompliance were coded using the Request/Compliance Coding Scheme. In general, the results supported the hypotheses that (1) child <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> noncompliance are related to maternal request strategies, which vary according to child age and play context, and that (2) maternal childhood histories of social withdrawal contribute to the prediction of request strategies, which serve to predict child <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> noncompliance. Taken together, these results elucidate the role of play context in the development of compliance with maternal requests, and broaden the current understanding of the pathways towards maladaptive and healthy social development. Furthermore, these results have implications for early interventions and parent training program...|$|R
