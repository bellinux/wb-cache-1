5|$|In August 2012, oxygen {{levels in}} the river {{were found to be}} low, {{following}} the death of thousands of fish. The Environment Agency were notified and <b>aerated</b> the water while they investigated the cause of the problem. This was thought to result from naturally occurring algae, which deplete the oxygen on which the fish depend, and may also have been affected by a reaction between hydrogen peroxide, which is used to improve oxygen {{levels in the}} water, and traces of detergent. The reaction results in an unpleasant-looking foam building up on the surface, although the foam is not hazardous. The Winsford and District Angling Association, who use the river for fishing, believe it will take many years to restore the six species of fish affected by the incident.|$|E
5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an <b>aerated</b> irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the oxygen transfer characteristics of an ejector aeration system. In order to evaluate the oxygen transfer performance of the ejector aeration system, a comparative experiment was conducted on a conventional blower aeration system. The effect of entrained air flow rate and <b>aerating</b> water temperature on the oxygen transfer efficiency was investigated. The dissolved oxygen concentration increased with increasing entrained air flow rate, but decreased with increasing <b>aerating</b> water temperature for two aeration systems. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient increased with increasing entrained air flow rate and with increasing <b>aerating</b> water temperature for both aeration systems. The average mass transfer coefficient for the ejector aeration system was about 20 % and 42 % higher than that of the blower aeration system within the experimental range of entrained air flow rates and <b>aerating</b> water temperatures...|$|R

25|$|<b>Aerated</b> lagoons are a low {{technology}} suspended-growth {{method of}} secondary treatment using motor-driven aerators {{floating on the}} water surface to increase atmospheric oxygen transfer to the lagoon and to mix the lagoon contents. The floating surface aerators are typically rated to deliver the amount of air equivalent to 1.8 to 2.7kg O2/kW·h. <b>Aerated</b> lagoons provide less effective mixing than conventional activated sludge systems and do not achieve the same performance level. The basins may range in depth from 1.5 to 5.0 metres. Surface-aerated basins achieve 80 to 90 percent removal of BOD with retention times of 1 to 10 days. Many small municipal sewage systems in the United States (1 million gal./day or less) use <b>aerated</b> lagoons.|$|E

25|$|In an <b>aerated</b> basin system, the aerators provide two functions: they {{transfer}} {{air into}} the basins required by the biological oxidation reactions, and they provide the mixing required for dispersing the air and for contacting the reactants (that is, oxygen, wastewater and microbes). Typically, the floating surface aerators are rated to deliver the amount of air equivalent to 1.8 to 2.7kg O2/kWh. However, they do not provide as good mixing as is normally achieved in activated sludge systems and therefore <b>aerated</b> basins do not achieve the same performance level as activated sludge units.|$|E
