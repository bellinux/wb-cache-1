40|$|This paper {{presents}} some {{findings about}} studies investigating how children 2 ̆ 7 s ability to answer pragmatically demanding questions and explain their correct answers develops between the <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> 3 and 9 years in Finnish children (Loukusa, 2007; Loukusa, Leinonen 2 ̆ 6 Ryder, 2007; Loukusa, Ryder, 2 ̆ 6 Leinonen, in press). In this paper we summarize the results concerning questions demanding processing of implicatures, routines and feelings. The {{results of these}} studies showed that the largest increase in answers to routine and implicature questions occurred between the <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> and four. In feeling questions rapid development occurred between <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> and five. After that development progressed more gradually until the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> eight when the children performed near the ceiling level {{in all of the}} question types. Giving explanations for correct answers developed gradually between the <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> and nine which indicated that becoming aware of the information used in inference has a longer developmental timeframe...|$|R

5|$|Horses, {{particularly}} colts, {{sometimes are}} physically capable of reproduction at about 18months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed before the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>three,</b> especially females. Horses {{four years old}} are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop {{until the age of}} six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.|$|E

5|$|Only {{purebred}} Mérens may {{be registered}} in the breed stud book. The selection of stallions is rigorous, based on tests at the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>three.</b> The breeding goal is to produce horses with the ideal conformation and good character. The gaits are subject to particular observation in all stallions, and during the three-year-old inspections, they must perform a dressage test, a cross-country jumping test, a test on the longe line and a physical inspection. The Mérens {{has one of the}} most stringent inspection procedures, and breeders aim to achieve a steady increase in the quality of the breed. Mares are evaluated during a breed competition organized by the French National Stud.|$|E

5|$|A grandniece of Anne Boleyn {{and close}} to Elizabeth since childhood, Lettice Knollys was {{introduced}} early into court life. At 17 she married Walter Devereux, Viscount Hereford, who in 1572 became Earl of Essex. After her husband went to Ireland in 1573 she possibly became involved with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. There was plenty of scandalous talk, not least when Essex died in Ireland of dysentery in 1576. Two years later Lettice Knollys married Robert Dudley in private. When the Queen was told of the marriage she banished the Countess forever from court, effectively curtailing her social life. The couple's child, Robert, Lord Denbigh, died at the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>three,</b> to the great grief of his parents and ending all prospects for the continuance of the House of Dudley. Lettice Knollys' union with Leicester was nevertheless a happy one, as was her third marriage to the much younger Sir Christopher Blount, whom she unexpectedly married in 1589 only {{six months after the}} Earl's death. She continued to style herself Lady Leicester.|$|E
5|$|A herbivore, the bohor reedbuck prefers {{grasses and}} tender reed shoots with high protein and low fiber content. This reedbuck is {{dependent}} on water, though green pastures can fulfill its water requirement. The social structure of the bohor reedbuck is highly flexible. Large aggregations are observed during the dry season, when hundreds of bohor reedbuck assemble near a river. Males become sexually mature at the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> to four years, while females can conceive at just one year of age, reproducing every nine to fourteen months. Though there is no fixed breeding season, mating peaks in the rainy season. The gestation period is {{seven and a half}} months long, after which a single calf is born. The calves are weaned at eight to nine months of age.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{he could}} walk, Braille spent time playing in his father's workshop. At the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>three,</b> the child was playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E
