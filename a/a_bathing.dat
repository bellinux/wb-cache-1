5|$|Umbul Pasiraman, {{also known}} as Umbul Binangun or Umbul Winangun, is <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> complex for the royal family. The bathing complex is an {{enclosed}} space surrounded by tall structures. It consists of three pools decorated with mushroom-shaped springs and large flower pots.|$|E
5|$|A {{temple was}} {{constructed}} in AD60–70, and <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> complex was built up over the next 300years. Engineers drove oak piles into the mud to provide a stable foundation, and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. In the 2nd century, the spring was enclosed within a wooden barrel-vaulted structure that housed the caldarium (hot bath), tepidarium (warm bath), and frigidarium (cold bath).|$|E

5|$|In 1908, the Dip the Dips Scenic Railway {{roller coaster}} opened but was soon overshadowed in 1912 {{by the larger}} Leap the Dips ride. In 1917, Dip the Dips was razed and {{replaced}} by the Leap Frog Scenic Railway. With three roller coasters and a growing variety of other rides, Cedar Point was beginning to grow as an amusement park, though that was not Boeckling's priority. He marketed the peninsula primarily as <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> resort complete with shows, exhibits, motion pictures, {{and other forms of}} entertainment, but did not emphasize the park's rides.|$|E
5|$|Taman Sari can {{be divided}} into four areas. The first area is the {{artificial}} lake Segaran located in the west.

5|$|The {{building}} of Taman Sari commenced {{during the reign}} of Sultan Hamengkubuwono I (1755–1792), the first sultan of the Yogyakarta Sultanate, and was completed by the time of Sultan Hamengkubuwono II. The building site, however, had already been known as <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> place called Pacethokan Spring since Sunan Amangkurat IV’s reign (1719–1726). According to Kitab Mamana in Yogyakarta Kraton, the project leader for the construction of Taman Sari was Tumenggung Mangundipura. He had travelled twice to Batavia to learn about European architecture, which is the reason why the architecture of Taman Sari has marks of European style.|$|E
5|$|The {{resort is}} among the first modern tourist destinations, after King George III's, brother the Duke of Gloucester built a grand {{residence}} there, Gloucester Lodge, and passed the mild winter there in 1780; the King made Weymouth his summer holiday residence on fourteen occasions between 1789 and 1805, even venturing into the sea in <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> machine. A painted statue of the King stands on the seafront, called the King's Statue, which was renovated in 2007/8 by stripping 20 layers of paintwork, replacing it with new paints and gold leaf, and replacing the iron framework with a stainless steel one. A mounted white horse representing the King is carved into the chalk hills of Osmington.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the single's US picture sleeve {{consisted}} of a photo of Harrison playing guitar inside the central tower of his recently purchased home, Friar Park, in Henley-on-Thames. The tower's sole, octagonal-shaped room was an area that Harrison had adopted as his personal temple and meditation space. This picture was taken by photographer Barry Feinstein, whose Camouflage Productions partner, Tom Wilkes, originally used {{it as part of}} an elaborate poster intended as an insert in the album package. The poster featured a painting of the Hindu deity Krishna watching a group of naked maidens beside <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> pond. Harrison apparently felt uncomfortable with the symbolism in Wilkes's design – the Friar Park tower image filled {{the top half of the}} poster, floating among clouds above the Krishna scene – so Wilkes abandoned the concept and instead used a darkened photo of Harrison inside the house as the album poster. The more common picture sleeve internationally was a close-up of Feinstein's All Things Must Pass front-cover image, taken on the main lawn of Friar Park. In Denmark, the sleeve featured four shots of Harrison, again with guitar, taken on stage during the Delaney & Bonnie tour.|$|E

5|$|The Baths {{were built}} around hot springs, {{the only ones}} {{naturally}} occurring in the United Kingdom. Archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} main spring in its natural state was treated as a shrine by the Celts. During the early Roman occupation of Britain, in the 60s or 70s AD, engineers drove oak piles into the mud to provide a stable foundation and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. These still survive. At this early stage the spring was an open pool {{in the corner of the}} temple precinct. It fed <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> complex on its south side within a barrel-vaulted building. The complex was gradually built up over the next 300years. All the stonework above the level of the baths is from more recent periods including the 12th century, when John of Tours built a curative bath over the King's Spring reservoir, and the 16th century, when the city corporation built a new bath (Queen's Bath) to the south of the spring. The spring is now housed in 18th-century buildings designed by architects John Wood, the Elder and John Wood, the Younger; visitor access is via an 1897 concert hall by J M Brydon, which is an eastward continuation of the Grand Pump Room with a glass-domed centre and single-storey radiused corner.|$|E

50|$|The {{bathroom}} {{has evolved}} {{to become more}} practical, particularly with the displacement of the geyser.

Other furniture includes a washbasin, bidet, shower and mirror.|$|R

In 1812 Paterson went into the shipping business and by 1817 he had a steamboat operating regularly between Limerick and Kilrush. The increasing popularity of Kilkee as <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> resort brought many transit travellers to Kilrush.|$|E
25|$|Others welcome {{everyone}} whether dressed or nude (subject {{to other}} miscellaneous rules and requirements).

If a full nudity policy were in place, such a family would have to split up for the day, or find an alternative activity. A few resorts attempt a compromise by allowing females to wear minimal clothing, but not males.|$|E
