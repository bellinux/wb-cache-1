60|$|There is also {{a certain}} curious {{tropical}} American carp which, though it hardly deserves {{to be considered in}} the strictest sense as a fish out of water, yet manages to fall nearly half-way under that peculiar category, for it always swims with its head partly above the surface and partly below. But the funniest thing in this queer arrangement is the fact that one half of each eye is out in the air and the other half is beneath in the water. Accordingly, the eye is divided horizontally by a dark strip into two distinct and unlike portions, the upper one of which has a pupil adapted to vision in the air alone, while the lower is adapted to seeing in the water only. The fish, in fact, always swims with its eye half out of the water, and it can see as well on dry land as in its native ocean. Its name is <b>Anableps,</b> but in all probability it does not wish the fact to be generally known.|$|E

Both species group themselves into schools of ten to 50 individuals; however, A. microlepis is predominant in the summer when the water is more saline, while A. <b>anableps</b> predominates in the winter when the water is fresh. Regarding sex ratio, it was of 1 : 1 for A. <b>anableps,</b> while A. microlepis females surpassed males in a ratio of 2 : 1. In relation to size, A. <b>anableps</b> (x = 240 mm) is on average smaller than A. microlepis (x = 270 mm), but females of each species were significantly larger than the males. Both species reproduce throughout the year, yet with reproductive peaks in distinct periods: A. <b>anableps</b> in winter and A. microlepis in summer. Each female produces ten to 31 oocytes that are released into the ovarian cavity when they reach 1. 0 - 1. 5 mm in diameter; when reaching 2. 0 mm they attach themselves once again to the ovary’s wall, where they remain until eclosion. The embryos are released inside the ovarian cavity when development is complete and measure 45 - 47 mm in length at birth. Despite being mixed, each species maintains distinct strategies regarding structural and temporal organization time, and requiringdifferent environmental conditions – possibly those that are more favorable for offspring development...|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} for aquatic vertebrates that invade land is feeding in the terrestrial realm. The {{capacity of the}} gape to become parallel with the ground {{has been shown to}} be a key factor to allow fishes to feed on prey lying on a terrestrial surface. To do so, two strategies have been identified that involve a nose-down tilting of the head: (1) by pivoting on the pectoral fins as observed in mudskippers, and (2) curling of the anterior part of the body supported by a long and flexible eel-like body as shown in eel-catfish. Although <b>Anableps</b> <b>anableps</b> successfully feeds on land, it does not possess an eel-like body or pectoral fins to support or lift the anterior part of the body. We identified the mechanism of terrestrial prey-capture in A. <b>anableps</b> by studying kinematics and functional morphology of the cranial structures, using high-speed video and graphical 3 D reconstructions from computed tomography scans. In contrast to the previously described mechanisms, A. <b>anableps</b> relies solely on upper and lower jaw movement for re-orientation of the gape towards the ground. The premaxilla is protruded antero-ventrally, and the lower jaw is depressed to a right angle with the substrate. Both the lower and upper jaws are selectively positioned onto the prey. <b>Anableps</b> <b>anableps</b> thereby uses the jaw protrusion mechanism previously described for other cyprinodontiforms to allow a continued protrusion of the premaxilla even while closing the jaws.

These features make the four-eyed fish an excellent model for the study of evolutionary processes related to genetic differentiation of species and populations in estuaries. The evolutionary history of A. <b>anableps</b> was inferred from phylogeographic and population analyses using sequences of the mitochondrial DNA Control Region of 13 populations distributed in the Amazon and Northeast Coast of Brazil from Calcoene (Amapa) to Parnaiba (Piaui). The 83 retrieved haplotypes show a pattern of four distinct mitochondrial lineages, with up to 3. 4 % nucleotide divergence among them. The evolutionary reconstruction suggests that these lineages diverged recently in the late Pleistocene/early Holocene after the Atlantic Ocean reaching current levels. Analysis of variability, neutrality and the genetic expansion pattern revealed that the lineages have distinct characteristics, which were shaped by the different geomorphological features of coastal regions combined with sea level oscillations over a very long period of time. Only few neighboring populations show a discreet gene flow.

40|$|Mangroves are {{considered}} important as fish nurseries worldwide. Block netting in intertidal mangrove creeks at HW revealed the overwhelming {{significance of the}} factors tide and time of day and their combinations (spring tide at dusk and dawn, neap tide at midday and midnight) in structuring fish assemblages. In contrast to neap tide and daylight when nekton catches were poorest, spring tide and darkness produced the most complex fish assemblage structure when abundant species occurred with increased proportions and more rare species entered. Intertidal fish were juveniles or adults of small species, or juveniles of larger species. Stomach analyses of fish showed that the intertidal movements are usually feeding migrations. Fish were concentrated in the subtidal sections at LW. Pioneer studies with a 200 kHz split-beam sonar beaming horizontally and vertically in a large mangrove channel, revealed that the entire fish community rode the first flood rise to achieve upstream transport and to enter the intertidal zone. Despite low Secchi depths, diel changes in vertical distribution were apparent when fish exploited the water column only at night. The four-eyed fish <b>Anableps</b> <b>anableps</b> entered the intertidal creeks rapidly with the first flood rise.

A total of 865 specimens were collected, from which an adult sex ratio of 2. 12 females per male was recorded (&# 967;² = 13. 07; p< 0. 05). Females presented positively allometric growth, whereas males were negatively allometric. In the additional analyses, the gonads of 371 female specimens were observed microscopically.

40|$|Abstract Background Jenynsia onca, {{commonly}} known as the one sided livebearer, {{is a member of the}} family Anablepidae. The opsin gene repertoires of J. onca 's close relatives, the four-eyed fish (<b>Anableps</b> <b>anableps)</b> and the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), have been characterized and each found to include one unique LWS opsin. Currently, the relationship among LWS paralogs and orthologs in these species are unclear, making it difficult to test the hypotheses that link vision to morphology or life history traits. The phylogenetic signal appears to have been disrupted by gene conversion. Here we have sequenced the opsin genes of J. onca in order to resolve these relationships. Findings We identified nine visual opsins; LWS S 180 r, LWS S 180, LWS P 180, SWS 1, SWS 2 A, SWS 2 B, RH 1, RH 2 - 1, and RH 2 - 2. Key site analysis revealed only one unique haplotype, RH 2 - 2, although this is unlikely to shift λ max significantly. LWS P 180 was found to be a product of a gene conversion event with LWS S 180, followed by convergence to a proline residue at the 180 site. Conclusion Jenynsia onca has at least 9 visual opsins: three LWS, one RH 1, two RH 2, one SWS 1 and two SWS 2. The presence of LWS P 180 moves the location of the LWS P 180 -S 180 tandem duplication event back to the base of the Poeciliidae-Anablepidae clade, expanding the number of species possessing this unusual blue shifted LWS opsin. The presence of the LWS P 180 gene also confirms that gene conversion events have homogenized opsin paralogs in fish, just as they have in humans. </p...|$|E
30|$|A {{minority}} of fish (Figure  4, Group B) showed {{a preference for}} shallower stations and ebb tides, including detritivorous mugilids, A. elymus, G. oyena, G. richardsonii, and small S. barracuda. The mugilids and A. elymus were found at high densities at L during ebb tides. Furthermore, we found that these two species mostly stayed near the water’s surface and seldom moved into seagrass meadows. Their decreased presence during flood tides may also be due to predator avoidance. As mentioned above, numerous piscivores migrated into the shallows during flood tides, and mugilids and A. elymus were important food sources for these predators. These fish may thus change their habitats during the early period of flood tides to avoid predators. Other surface-dwelling fish such as Fundulus heteroclitus in salt marshes (Kimball and Able 2012) and <b>Anableps</b> <b>anableps</b> in mangroves (Brenner and Krumme 2007) also alter their habitat during flood tides. Moreover, the POM on which mugilids feed is typically derived from primary producers (Blay 1995; Lin et al. 2007). The nearshore water circulation at L was relatively low in this study due to {{the distance of the}} study station from the channel (Figure  1), and detritus from seagrass and littoral plants readily accumulated (Huang 2012), providing a significant food source for these detritivorous mugilids. A. elymus and G. oyena can also feed on detritus, suggesting that these fish may have sufficient food sources in the lagoon. We also found that A. elymus fed on some terrestrial insects, meaning not all of their food comes from seagrass meadows. The fact that these surface-dwelling fish do not appear to interact with or reside within seagrass meadows may explain why their behavior differed from that of the seagrass inhabiting fish species.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{understand}} {{and compare the}} optical, histological, and ecological differences among 4 vertebrate species that have had evolutionary attempts toward 4 eyes. METHODS: An evolutionary attempt at 4 eyes in defined as the duplication or one or more structures integral to the refraction or interpretation of the visible spectrum for that animal. We reviewed and compared the known optics, histology, and ecology {{of each of these}} vertebrate species with attempts at 4 eyes including <b>Anableps</b> <b>anableps,</b> Dialomnus fuscus, Mnierpes macrocephalus, and Bathylychnops exilis. These animals have developed portions of ancillary eyes that have diverged from the primary globe in 3 different patterns. At least 1 specimen of each of those vertebrate species known to have 4 eyes was examined histologically and compared to the animal's ecology and current cladistic relationship. RESULTS: A anabteps has 2 distinct optical systems in each eye: an upper one for aerial vision and a lower system for aquatic vision. These systems feature separate retinae and an asymmetric lens to achieve focus in the aerial and aquatic vision, but only 1 optic nerve per eye. The visual system is split horizontally to function optimally in a "prone" position in the water. D fuscus is a terrestrial feeder and has a vertically (almost perpendicular to the long axis of the fish) divided cornea using pigment and a condensation of collagen as the divider, a single pupil, and a divided retina. The split cornea allows for the fish to remain vertical with 1 cornea in air and 1 cornea in water. M macrocephalus is probably closely related to D fuscus with a similar split cornea. B exilis is a mesopelagic inhabitant living at approximately 200 to 1, 000 m and has an ancillary globe that "buds" off the primary globe. This secondary globe is directed inferiorly toward the ocean floor as compared to the primary globe, which is directed 35 degrees superiorly from the horizontal. Adult species of B exilis have 2 additional scleral bodies suspected to be lenses. If so, these structures would be capable of focusing light from the inferior field onto the superior retina, presumably adding to the panoramic inferior visual field. There are other mesopelagic species, including Styleophorus chordatus, Opisthoproctus grimaldii, Scopelarchus gantheri (or guentheri), Dolichopteryx binocularis, Benthalbella infans, and Evermannella indica, that have other unusual ocular mechanisms, such as retinal diverticulae and lens pads capable of reflection, but do not meet the definition of multiple eyes, as defined for purposes of this work. CONCLUSIONS: D fuscus and M macrocephalus are terrestrial feeders requiring aquatic and aerial vision, and hence have a split cornea for this purpose, and they probably use their anterior corneae for terrestrial vision. A <b>anableps</b> swims at the surface with combined aerial and aquatic vision for feeding and protection from predators. B exilis is a mesopelagic feeder requiring a binocular visual field in the horizontal meridian and above, and simultaneously is a bottom scavenger using an ancillary globe and perhaps scleral lenses for recognition of bioluminescent detritus. Although 2 of these models are related (D fuscus and M macrocephalus), these 4 fish represent 3 separate, distinct, and unrelated convergent evolutionary attempts toward 4 eyes in vertebrates satisfying the ecological needs of each. The 3 different models are unrelated evolutionarily and are found in 3 separate orders...|$|E
