40|$|DE 19829284 A UPAB: 20000112 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} {{transforming the}} two temporal channels (l,r) into the frequency domain, and forming a spectral mono channel (M) {{by combining the}} spectral L and R channels. Three predictions are performed for the spectral L,R and M channels to obtain filtered channels (L'. R',M'). The filtered channels are encoded to obtain the mono-layer of the scaled bit-stream. The encoded filtered mono channel is decoded to obtain an encoded/decoded mono channel (M). The filtered L' and R' channels and the encoded/decoded mono channel are subjected to a prediction using similar prediction coefficients. Spectral stereo signals (L, R, M, S) are formed for the stereo layer of the scaled bit stream by comparing the processed mono channel (M') with the processed filtered channels L' and R'. and/or by combining them. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for a method of processing a temporal stereo signal, a method of decoding an <b>audio</b> <b>bit</b> <b>stream</b> and an apparatus for processing a temporal stereo signal.

40|$|In this {{research}} work, various audio watermarking techniques {{have been studied}} and investigated. A novel audio watermarking method is proposed in which watermark is added transparently after ADPCM (Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation). In the proposed scheme we have used random sample instead of fixed or low frequency carriers to embed the watermark into the <b>audio</b> <b>bit</b> <b>stream.</b> Proposed technique has been implemented and its audio quality parameters are {{compared to the other}} best known audio watermarking technique. Comparison has been done on the basis of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, Signal to Noise ratio and Bit Error Rate. The new scheme is suitable for retaining first generation archived files of high quality. A tool has been used for measuring the audio quality factors. Further, these quality parameters have been used to generate graphical outputs and tabular values for comparison with the best known audio watermarking technique. As the audio signal quality metrics i. e. higher Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and lower Bit Error Rate (BER) and higher Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) itself are proving that the proposed technique for audio Watermarking is good one. The comparison with the best known Watermarking technique known as An Adaptive Watermarking Algorithm for MP 3 Compressed Audio Signal techniques proves that the newly proposed and implemented algorithm has given much better results for audio watermarking. Higher values of PSNR of audio signal also prove the robustness of the proposed algorithm. Key words...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays the {{multimedia}} technology in distributed environments becomes realistic and {{the multimedia}} copyright protection issue {{becomes more and}} more important. Various digital watermarking techniques have been proposed in recent years as the methods to protect the copyright of multimedia data. Although, conceptually, these techniques can be easily extended for protecting digital audio data, it is challenging to apply these techniques to MPEG Audio streams because we need to design the watermarking schemes working directly in the compressed data domain. In this paper, we present watermarking methods whichwillembed the watermark directly into the MPEG <b>audio</b> <b>bit</b> <b>streams</b> rather than going through expensive decoding/encoding process in order to apply watermarking schemes in uncompressed data domain. Among the two presented schemes, one embeds the watermark into the Scale Factors of the MPEG audio streams and another one embeds the watermark into the MPEG encoded samples. Our experimental results show that both methods perform well and the distortion could be controlled at the minimal level. While we use MPEG Audio Layer II streams in our experimental tests, the proposed schemes can be applied to MPEG Audio Layer I and III. Furthermore, by enforcing creation of the watermark through a standard encryption function such as DES, the proposed schemes will be successful in resolving rightful ownership of watermarked MPEG audio...|$|R

40|$|Digital audio {{compression}} allows the efficient storage and transmission of audio data. The various {{audio compression}} techniques offer {{different levels of}} complexity, audio quality, and amount of data compression. The MPEG audio algorithm {{is a kind of}} lose compression. It is a psycho-acoustic algorithm that provides signal-to-mask ratio for bits or noise allocation and <b>bit</b> <b>stream</b> formatting. MPEG- 1 standard enables coding of a single- or two-channel sound at the sampling frequencies of 32, 44. 1 and 48 kHz. The principles and features of MPEG algorithm are described and a Matlab implementation is presented. Then some special features of this compression algorithm are dealt with. We describe a variable bit rate (VBR) coding algorithm proposal with the possibility of implementation in MPEG- 1 Audio standard, especially in layer 1. VBR coding means that the bit rate is not constant at the output of a coder like in MPEG- 1 <b>Audio</b> standard <b>bit</b> <b>stream</b> but it alters according to the input information content of the compressed signal and the maximum distortion allowed. We did listening tests for the proposed algorithm that validate its accuracy. Low-bit rate coding, particularly MPEG- 1, is being used {{in a wide range of}} state-of-the-art audio applications such as digital audio broadcasting or network conferencing, too. It has been found that audio quality can degrade markedly if multiple stages of encoding and decoding are used. The usual approach to designing audio codes that preserve the quality in cascaded arrangement consists in transferring some additional information in the decoded audio signal that enables to correct the growing distortion. The experiments indicate that the quality degradation problem can be caused by improper quantization characteristic in case of quantization with 2 bits. We altered standard quantization in the encoder by changing allocated scale factor at the nearest higher. Thereby the distortion was considerably decreased. The condition of this improvement is the synchronization of codes. Available from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R
