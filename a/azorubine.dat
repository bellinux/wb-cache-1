40|$|Title: Designing {{and testing}} of new metal nanosubstrates for biomolecular sensors based on surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) spectroscopy Author: Vlastimil Peksa Department: Institute of Physics of Charles University Supervisor: doc. RNDr. Marek Procházka, Ph. D., Institute of Physics of Charles University Abstract: This experimental methodical work was aimed at the optimization of selected gold and silver substrates and their use in construction of SERS-based biosensors, including following practical application. Several types of substrates, fabricated via a combination of bottom-up techniques on solid surfaces, were tested. The properties of these substrates were examined with probe molecules, namely methylene blue, porphyrins and tryptophan, on a confocal Raman microspectrometer. Obtained findings {{about the influence of}} analyte application, objective focusing and internal intensity standard were exploited for optimization of measurement procedures with regard to sensitivity, accuracy and reproducibility. A method for quantitative detection of food dye <b>azorubine</b> (E 122) in commercially available drinks was developed, based on these findings. Its results have shown its potential as a pre-scan method for field application and preliminary testing. Keywords: Metal nanosubstrates, biomolecules, [...] ...|$|E
40|$|An efficient, {{sensitive}} and fast method was developed {{based on an}} ultrasound-assisted extraction followed by an ion-pair dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (USAE-IP-DLLME) for the simultaneous determination of five commonly used synthetic sulfonate dyes (tartarazine, quinoline yellow, sunset yellow, <b>azorubine,</b> and brilliant blue) in ice cream samples using high performance liquid chromatography. First, important parameters on USAE and samples clean-up were investigated and optimized. Then, some effective parameters on DLLME were studied and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, good linearity (0. 5 – 1000 µg L- 1, > r 2 = 0. 99) were obtained for the dyes. Limits of detection and limits of quantization were {{in the range of}} 0. 01 – 0. 05 µg L- 1 and 0. 03 – 0. 15 µg L- 1, respectively. The recoveries of the five synthetic colorants ranged from 90. 3 to 109. 7 %. Intra (1. 4 – 6. 4 %) and inter-day precision (3. 9 – 9. 7 %) expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD) at 10 and 100 µg L- 1 levels less than 10 % were also achieved. Finally, this method has been applied successfully in the determination of the colorants in the ice cream samples...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDirect {{selective}} {{detection of}} erythrosine in saffron {{in the presence}} of other synthetic dyes considers its fluorescence at 532 nm excitation / 548 nm emission. Saffron pretreatment was according to the ISO 3632 - 2 trade standard test methods. On account of calculated quantum yield values none of the yellow dyes is expected to interfere. Among red ones, reservations about allura red AC, <b>azorubine</b> and red 2 G were not verified by experimentation signifying excellent method specificity. Detection and quantification limits (0. 56 and 1. 70 nM) were of the same magnitude to those reported in literature after chromatographic separation of erythrosine. Percent recovery from spiked saffron samples ranging from 63 - 141 was acceptable for residue levels in foods. Matrix effect from crocins (saffron pigments) was evidenced only at a lower spiking level (0. 02 mg kg- 1). The minimum required performance limit (MRPL) value was 0. 04 mg kg- 1 indicating that the method is appropriate for traces of erythrosine in saffron. Our approach offers improved sensitivity (by three orders of magnitude) and specificity than the direct spectrophotometric detection of certain synthetic dyes in saffron and deserves attention by the ISO Technical Committee for "Herbs, culinary spices and condiments...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that some of the food additives may cause sensitization, inflammation of tissues, and potentially risk factors in the development of several chronic diseases. Thus, we hypothesized that expressions of common inflammatory molecules – known {{to be involved in the}} development of various inflammatory conditions and cancers – are affected by these food additives. We investigated the effects of commonly used food preservatives and artificial food colorants based on the expressions of NFκB, GADD 45 α, and MAPK 8 (JNK 1) from the tissues of liver. RNA was isolated based on Trizol protocol and the activation levels were compared between the treated and the control groups. Tartrazine alone could elicit effects on the expressions of NFκB (p[*]=[*] 0. 013) and MAPK 8 (p[*]=[*] 0. 022). <b>Azorubine</b> also resulted in apoptosis according to MAPK 8 expression (p[*]=[*] 0. 009). Preservatives were anti-apoptotic in high dose. Sodium benzoate (from low to high doses) dose-dependently silenced MAPK 8 expression (p[*]=[*] 0. 004 to p[*]=[*] 0. 002). Addition of the two preservatives together elicited significantly greater expression of MAPK 8 at half-fold dose (p[*]=[*] 0. 002) and at fivefold dose (p[*]=[*] 0. 008). This study suggests that some of the food preservatives and colorants can contribute to the activation of inflammatory pathways...|$|E
40|$|Actuality of the research. Development of {{standard}} samples (SS) of food colour content {{continues to be}} relevant to enhance safety and quality of food products, additives and other micro-ingredients {{as well as to}} deal with import substitution. Work objective. The objective of this work is to develop SS for the basic substance and toxic elements in the most frequently used in food technologies synthetic food colours: Tartrazine E 102, Yellow Quinoline E 104, <b>Azorubine</b> E 122 and Ponseau 4 R E 124. Research techniques. Mass fraction of colour in the samples was determined by spectrophotometry as per 320502013 GOST Standard; colour samples for toxic elements were evaluated according to 26929 - 94 GOST Standard; content of lead and cadmium was determined by atomic absorption analysis defined in the GOST 30178 - 96, arsenic -by calorimetry as per GOST 26930 - 94, mercury - by flameless atomic sorption spectrometry according to MU № 5178 - 90, homogeneity and shelf life - in conformity with RMG 93 - 2009, GOST 8. 531 - 2002 and Р 50. 2. 031 - 2003. Results. SS for the content of four food colours were developed based on the research findings.

40|$|The {{possibility}} that structurally unrelated food additives could show either joint actions or interactions has been assessed {{based on their}} potential to share common sites and mechanisms of action or common pathways of elimination. All food additives approved in the European Union and allocated numerical acceptable daily intake values were studied, initially based on the reports by the FAO-WHO Joint Expert Committee for Food Additives. Target organs were identified based on the effects reported at doses above the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in animal and human studies. The descriptions of the pathological and other changes reported {{were used to assess}} whether different additives, sharing the same target organ, would produce a common toxic effect. In all but a very few cases, the possibility of joint actions or interactions could be excluded on scientific grounds. The exceptions were on the liver (curcumin, thiabendazole, propyl gallate, and BHT), the kidney (diphenyl, o-phenylphenol, and ferrocyanide salts), the blood (<b>azorubine</b> and propyl gallate), and the thyroid (erythosine, thiabendazole, and nitrate). Toxicokinetic interactions were considered unlikely because of the low dosages involved, the diverse nature of the routes of metabolism and elimination, and the fact that enzyme induction or inhibition would have influenced selection of the NOAEL. Many of those additives which could not be excluded from showing joint actions or interactions would have low intakes; in some cases they were alternatives for the same application, thereby further lowering the combined intake. In consequence, joint actions or interactions between additives do not represent a significant health concern. (C) 2000 International Life Sciences Institute...|$|E
