40|$|The {{quality control}} {{laboratory}} at PolyPeptide has been performing analysis based on ion chromatography (IC) of peptides. A method {{for separation of}} negative ions (acetate, chloride etc) is already in use. Lately {{there has been a}} need for developing a method to separate positive ions, like ammonium ions, in peptides. The task of this project was to develop a method for ion chromatography, suitable for determination of ammonium ions in the substance D-alanine amide, hydrochloride (D-Ala-NH 2 ∙HCl). The D-alanine amide, hydrochloride is an amino acid derivative used as starting material for chemical synthesis of peptides. These peptides are used as active pharmaceutical substances. It is most possible to find ammonium chloride in amino acids substances which content <b>amid</b> <b>group,</b> as D-Ala-NH 2 ∙HCl. The ammonium chloride is formed during the synthesis of these amino acid derivatives. The reason for analysing ammonium ions is that there is some risk to find undesired impurities in the product. These impurities are difficult to remove...|$|E

Substances were tested by using microdilution broth method. Testing was carried out on eight strains of yeasts and filamentous fungi: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Trichosporon beigelii, Aspergillus fumigatus, Absidia corymbifera, Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Total were tested 49 substances, which are divided into four groups according to their chemical structure.

40|$|International audienceThe field {{dependence}} of the proton (I) spin-lattice relaxation rate is calculated for a dipole-dipole coupled spin pair, (I= 1 / 2) [...] (S= 1) where the quadrupole nucleus (S) is ^ 2 H or ^ 14 N with asymmetry parameter η= 0. The observed relaxation profile shows a marked enhancement for equal proton Larmor and quadrupole spin frequencies (i. e. ω_I= ω_Q), This phenomenon {{is referred to as}} the quadrupole dip, and has been observed for instance in ^ 14 N-^ 1 H <b>amid</b> <b>groups</b> of immobilized proteins. In this work an analysis of the observed relaxation enhancement is presented when the dipole-dipole coupling and the quadrupole interaction are modulated by the overall reorientational motion. A characteristic low field dispersion is observed when 3 / 2 τ_Rω_I > 1 where τ_R is the rotational correlation time. At higher fields the relaxation peak exhibits a Lorenzian like lineshape; L(ω_I) = [(ω_Q-ω_I) ^ 2 tau_R^ 2 (3 / 5) ^ 2 + 1]^- 1 which is centred at the quadrupole frequency. The quadrupole spin system shows a spin-lattice T_ 1 Q and a spin-spin relaxation time T_ 2 Q which become equal in the zero field limit. In the slow tumbling limit, the the quadrupole spin relaxation times, T_ 1 Q,T_ 2 Q are equal to 3 / 2 tau_R...|$|R
