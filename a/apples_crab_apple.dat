50|$|It was L. Fredric Hough, then a {{graduate}} student at the University of Illinois that studied the papers of C. S.

However, Crandall didn't see any fruits of his investigations, and if not Hough, all his collection and experiments would be lost. Hough's paper was published in 1944, and led to the 1945 collaboration with J. Ralph Shay. Hough then relocated to Rutgers and the collaborative effort was extended there.|$|R

5000|$|Wren's {{dining room}} is now used as a study. This beautifully {{proportioned}} room features wood panelling chosen by Wren and a fine marble fireplace {{similar to the one}} he installed for King William III in the King's dining room in Hampton Court Palace. Beyond the reception hall, a flight of stone steps take you into the garden which leads right down to the Thames. In Wren’s day his most important visitors - normally royalty - would arrive by river, walk across the garden and up those steps to enter his house via the back door. This meant the garden had to be just as magnificent as the house. The building is accordingly surrounded by several different types of tree and copious bushes bursting with figs, walnuts, <b>apples,</b> <b>crab</b> <b>apples,</b> cherries, raspberries, mint and borage. The greenery extends {{all the way to the}} river bank while York stone terraces lead to a pea shingle path which is flanked by lawn. This path then leads to a pond and fountain that was built by Wren and which was listed before The Old Court House itself. Wren’s tool house is now a charming garden room from which to enjoy the garden in the summer.|$|R

One day as I was walking, I noticed {{that one of the}} {{gratings}} was loose {{on the side of the}} wall. I decided to see where it led, and crawled in. Well I didn’t get too far along the tunnel when I got stuck. My brother was too frightened to come in so he got papa, who came with a pulley rope and made a loop at the end. He kept throwing it until it slipped over my feet. Slowly he tugged, and pulled me out. My hips and legs were all scraped, but that didn’t stop me from getting spanked for going in in the first place.|$|R
40|$|Breeding and {{cultivation}} of new apple cultivars {{are among the}} most attractive and important issues for apple researchers. As almost all apple cultivars exhibit gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI), cross-pollination between genetically different cultivars and species is essential not only for stable fruit production, but also for breeding of new cultivars. For cross-pollination by insect or hand pollination, pollen viability and pistil fertility are key factors, but also the mechanism of GSI has to be taken into account. This paper reviews the germination rate of pollen after storage in different conditions, at different periods of flowering, and in combination with pistil fertility and cross-compatibility among wild-, crab-, and cultivated apples. Furthermore, suitable cultivar combinations for new attractive apple cultivars based on GSI are explored. Especially, details about S-genotypes of apple cultivars, which are present in recent cultivar catalogues, are introduced together with a newly established on-line searchable database of S-genotypes of cultivars, wild <b>apples</b> and <b>crab</b> <b>apples</b> that shows incompatibility, semicompatibility, and full-compatibility...|$|R

50|$|Before {{pollination}} {{needs were}} understood, orchardists often planted entire blocks of apples {{of a single}} variety. Because apples are self-sterile, and different members of a single variety are genetic clones (equivalent to a single plant), {{this is not a}} good idea. Growers now supply pollenizers, by planting <b>crab</b> <b>apples</b> interspersed in the rows, or by grafting <b>crab</b> <b>apple</b> limbs on some trees. Pollenizers can also be supplied by putting drum bouquets of <b>crab</b> <b>apples</b> or a compatible apple variety in the orchard blocks.|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis summarizes known {{information about}} hybridization (anthropohybridization) <b>crab</b> <b>apple</b> with orchard apple. Next it follows up mainly genetic and morphometric methods that haven't {{been used in}} the hybridization studies yet. <b>Crab</b> <b>apple</b> (Malus sylvestris) is the only one wild species in Malus genus in Europe. However in the last few decades these populations are endangered by orchard apple (Malus ×domestica), that originates from central Asia. It often outspreads into the free nature and thereby closer to wild apple plants, that leads to easier hybridization of these two woods. This process leads up to decreasing number of genetically pure <b>crab</b> <b>apple</b> individuals and also to slow hybrid plants expansion. This trend, which was called anthropohybridization, can be observed also in the Prunus genus, where there hybridizes wild species European dwarf cherry Prunus fruticosa with tart cherry Prunus cerasus. Recent studies though refers to following genetic aspects of Malus domestica, namely formation by triple hybridisation. Several locations of <b>crab</b> <b>apple</b> were observed and analysed in Europe {{in the last few years}} for study of anthropohybridization degree with Malus ×domestica. There were observed hybrid plants in common with genetically pure Malus sylvestris. Key words: <b>crab</b> <b>apple,</b> [...] ...|$|R
