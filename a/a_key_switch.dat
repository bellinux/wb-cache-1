Giuliani came to visit the late Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, seeking his blessing and endorsement.|$|E
25|$|Through 21 CFR 1040, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates laser {{products}} entering {{commerce and}} requires all classIIIb and classIV lasers offered in commerce in the US to have five standard safety features: <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>switch,</b> a safety interlock dongle, a power indicator, an aperture shutter, and an emission delay (normally {{two to three}} seconds). OEM lasers, designed to be parts of other components (such as DVD burners), are exempt from this requirement. Some non-portable lasers {{may not have a}} safety dongle or an emission delay, but have an emergency stop button and/or a remote switch.|$|E
25|$|A Class 3B laser is {{hazardous}} if the eye {{is exposed}} directly, but diffuse reflections such as those from paper or other matte surfaces are not harmful. The AEL for continuous lasers in the wavelength range from 315nm to far infrared is 0.5W. For pulsed lasers between 400 and 700nm, the limit is 30mJ. Other limits apply to other wavelengths and to ultrashort pulsed lasers. Protective eyewear is typically required where direct viewing of a class3B laser beam may occur. Class-3B lasers must be equipped with <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> and a safety interlock. Class3B lasers are used inside CD and DVD writers, although the writer unit itself is class1 because the laser light cannot leave the unit.|$|E

40|$|Conductance {{oscillation}} {{characteristics in}} GaAs-based Schottky wrap gate (WPG) single electron transistors (SETs) were investigated both experimentally and theoretically {{in view of}} application as <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>switching</b> device in future quantum integrated circuits. Fabricated WPG SETs showed that clear conductance oscillation characteristics with {{a small number of}} high conductance peaks. A simple theory based on a quantum mechanical treatment reproduced qualitatively the features of the experimentally observed conductance peaks, indicating that the resonant tunneling contributes to currents in the WPG SETs. However, quantitatively, a discrepancy existed between theory and experiment on the temperature dependence of peak heights...|$|R

25|$|Class 4 is {{the highest}} and most {{dangerous}} class of laser, including all lasers that exceed the Class3B AEL. By definition, a class4 laser can burn the skin, or cause devastating and permanent eye damage {{as a result of}} direct, diffuse or indirect beam viewing. These lasers may ignite combustible materials, and thus may represent a fire risk. These hazards may also apply to indirect or non-specular reflections of the beam, even from apparently matte surfaces meaning that great care must be taken to control the beam path. Class4 lasers must be equipped with <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> and a safety interlock. Most industrial, scientific, military, and medical lasers are in this category. Medical lasers can have divergent emissions and require awareness of nominal ocular hazard distance (NOHD) and nominal ocular hazard area (NOHA).|$|E
2500|$|From 1971 to 1976, Buick's {{full-sized}} Estate Wagon {{shared the}} [...] wheelbase and 455 cubic-inch V8 with the Electra 225, and shared its {{interior and exterior}} styling from 1971 to 1974 (complete with the prerequisite four VentiPorts). And although from 1975 to 1976 the number of VentiPorts were reduced by one, and the front fascia was downgraded to a LeSabre's, the Electra 225 style chrome rocker panel moldings and distinctive Electra 225 style rear quarter panels (albeit without fender skirts) remained. These were the first Buick station wagons to be built on Buick's largest chassis since the Roadmaster Estates of 1947–53. The Estate Wagons, as did other GM full-sized wagons during these years, used a unique rear suspension with multi-leaf springs instead of the coil springs used on other full-sized Buicks, and other full-sized GM cars. The Estate Wagons also featured a new 'clamshell' tailgate design where the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof as the tailgate (manually or with power assist), slid into a recess under the cargo floor. The power tailgate, the first in station wagon history, ultimately supplanted the manual tailgate, which required marked effort to lift from storage. It was operated by switches on the instrument panel or <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> on the rear quarter panel. The clamshell system, heavy and complex, {{made it easier to}} load and unload the extremely long wagons in tight spaces. But it remained un-adopted by any other manufacturer, and would be eliminated when GM reduced the length of their wagons by about a foot in 1977, and the overriding concern became increased fuel economy.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{ubiquity of}} IP {{associated}} with the acknowledgment of ATM as <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>switching</b> technology has motivated an increasing interest towards {{the design of a}} more efficient way of operating IP over ATM networks. This approach is known under the name Label Swapping. A few studies have addressed the primary issue of providing simultaneously quality of service and multicast. We propose a solution where we mix an RSVP architecture with one Label Swapping technique called IP Switching. We discuss problems that arise when using cut-through associated with an RSVP multicast model and propose an application for an IPv 6 environment over an ATM switching hardware...|$|R

50|$|Switches can be {{designed}} to respond to any type of mechanical stimulus: for example, vibration (the trembler switch), tilt, air pressure, fluid level (a float switch), the turning of <b>a</b> <b>key</b> (<b>key</b> <b>switch),</b> linear or rotary movement (a limit switch or microswitch), or presence of a magnetic field (the reed switch). Many switches are operated automatically by changes in some environmental condition or by motion of machinery. A limit switch is used, for example, in machine tools to interlock operation with the proper position of tools. In heating or cooling systems a sail switch ensures that air flow is adequate in a duct. Pressure switches respond to fluid pressure.|$|R

In experiments using <b>a</b> <b>key</b> telephone <b>switching</b> system, the malfunction rates predicted by the test are shown to agree closely with observed rate...|$|R
50|$|Exposures {{typically}} {{required the}} use of a cockpit-mounted intervalometer, set by reference to speed, altitude, and interval so that the pilot or observer could obtain the correct exposures by <b>keying</b> <b>a</b> <b>switch.</b> Great flight precision was needed especially for exposures for stereography and cartography in general.|$|R
30|$|By {{using the}} CRISPR/Cas 9 genomic editing tool to {{generate}} the insertion or deletion mutations, we knocked out the OsLAP 6 /OsPKS 1 gene and obtained many its loss-of-function mutants. All of these mutants are in japonica background (Nipponbare) and have normal vegetative growth and male sterile phenotypes (Fig.  4), which was {{in agreement with the}} oslap 6 mutants in indica background (9311, Fig.  1). These results suggest that OsLAP 6 /OsPKS 1 is <b>a</b> <b>key</b> molecular <b>switch</b> of the male fertility in both japonica and indica rice.|$|R
5000|$|As did all GM B-Body wagons, the Safari and Grand Safari {{received}} GM's new clamshell tailgate. Operated by {{switches on}} the instrument panel or <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> on the rear quarter panel, the tailgate slid into a recess under the cargo floor while the electric window slid upward into the rear roof section. Pontiac boasted the new system {{made it easier to}} load and unload the wagon in tight spaces, but the [...] "Glide-Away" [...] tailgate was prone to electrical and mechanical problems, and water and air leakage problems, as the cars aged.|$|E
50|$|The Estate Wagons also {{featured}} a new 'clamshell' tailgate design, marketed as the Glide-away Tailgate, where the rear power-operated glass slid {{up into the}} roof as the lower tailgate (manually or with power assist), slid into a recess under the cargo floor. Ultimately, the manual lower tailgate was supplanted by the power tailgate. The tailgate system was operated by switches on the instrument panel or <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> on the rear quarter panel. Like a top-hinged tailgate, the clamshell design allowed a user to stand directly at the open cargo area without impediment, facilitating loading and unloading in tight spaces.|$|E
50|$|To {{reduce the}} weight, {{the level of}} fuel carried is altered: for {{intermodal}} applications the fuel level is 7,300 litres, for coal applications that permit higher axle loads the fuel level is increased to 13,500 litres, with an intermediate fuel level of 10,750 litres also available. These limits are enforced during refuelling by a float switch in the tank, the permitted level being set by <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> with an indication displayed in the cab if the limits are breached. The provision of inline refuelling permits the topping up of the tanks in transit from a separate tank wagon behind the locomotives.|$|E

When an elevator is placed on independent service, it will no longer respond to hall calls. (In a bank of elevators, traffic is rerouted to the other elevators, while in a single elevator, the hall buttons are disabled). The elevator will remain parked on a floor with its doors open until a floor is selected and the door close button is held until the elevator starts to travel. Independent service is useful when transporting large goods or moving groups of people between certain floors.|$|E

50|$|However, {{to reduce}} cost and design complexity, most {{computer}} keyboards do not isolate all keys in this way.

A preference developed for the longer ratios of the progressive ratio under the non-shock key color. When the severity of punishment suppressed responding under the key color correlated with shock, the subjects continued to switch to the shock condition after a moderate degree of responding under the non-shock condition. Severe punishment also resulted in frequent, ineffective responses on the <b>switching</b> <b>key</b> and extended pausing under the key color associated with shock...|$|R
30|$|Although a {{few studies}} {{examined}} whether changing perspectives affected EL, perspective switching was neither directly tested nor recorded. Therefore, it remains unknown whether, when, and where participants strategically switch during learning. Initial work should focus on this basic point. For this basic question, learners could have access to both perspectives simultaneously (similar to the Brunyé et al., 2012 split-screen video). Eye movements could then reveal whether and how many times participants switch between the perspectives. Examining purposeful switching, learners could switch perspectives on demand (akin to using a mobile device). This could be accomplished by pressing <b>a</b> <b>key</b> to <b>switch</b> or using available gestural commands with a Hololens.|$|R
