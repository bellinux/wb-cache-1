30|$|The iron foams were {{synthesized}} by {{an improved}} sol-gel <b>autocombustion</b> method. We have just introduced a sol-gel <b>autocombustion</b> method {{in the preparation}} of several metals and alloys recently [26]. However, this method met some difficulties in the synthesis of metal iron. The metal iron is more active than other metals such as Co and Ni; thus, it is more difficult to reduce the metal from the iron oxide(s) than the cobalt oxide(s) and nickel oxide(s). In this study, we found that the reduction ability of the sol-gel combustion process can be improved by the addition of a suitable amount of ethanol {{in the preparation of}} the sol; thus, the metal iron can be reduced from its dried gel by the improved sol-gel <b>autocombustion</b> process.|$|E
