25|$|When a noun, pronoun, adjective, or verb {{has a long}} vowel or diphthong in the accented {{syllable}} and its stem ends in a single l, n, or s, the r (or the elder r- or z-variant ʀ) in an ending is assimilated. When the <b>accented</b> <b>vowel</b> is short, the ending is dropped.|$|E
25|$|Stress helps {{predict the}} tones {{of all the}} vowels in a word: {{stressed}} vowels are high in pitch; all vowels following the stressed vowel are low in pitch; all short vowels preceding the stressed vowel are low in pitch; all long vowels preceding the stressed vowel are high in pitch; short vowels occurring between a long vowel and the <b>accented</b> <b>vowel</b> assimilate to a high pitch.|$|E
5000|$|Neuter nouns {{usually have}} no ending {{or have a}} final <b>accented</b> <b>vowel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{convention}} is to mark stress by underlining <b>accented</b> <b>vowels,</b> e.g. koyoowut “whale”.|$|R
5000|$|To these, five grave <b>accented</b> <b>vowels</b> {{are also}} used: Àà; Èè; Ìì; Òò; Ùù ...|$|R
50|$|Also lacking are {{the keys}} for {{uppercase}} <b>accented</b> <b>vowels,</b> {{some of which}} are present in Italian; however, these characters aren't typically found on modern keyboards, either.|$|R
50|$|A few names {{end with}} an <b>accented</b> <b>vowel,</b> for {{instance}} Niccolò and Giosuè.|$|E
50|$|Accent {{will spread}} from an <b>accented</b> <b>vowel</b> to the {{following}} vowel across morpheme boundaries.|$|E
50|$|Like Proto-Indo-European and Vedic Sanskrit (and also Avestan, {{though it}} was not written down), Proto-Indo-Iranian had a pitch accent, {{indicated}} by an acute accent over the <b>accented</b> <b>vowel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Slovene has {{a rising}} vowel, which {{reflects}} the original acute. All short <b>accented</b> <b>vowels</b> in non-final syllables were lengthened, which eliminated the length distinction in the genitive plural.|$|R
50|$|The Poljane dialect lacks pitch accent. An unusual {{feature of}} the dialect is that stress is {{retracted}} from originally circumflex long vowels and remaining short <b>accented</b> <b>vowels,</b> resulting in newly <b>accented</b> short <b>vowels</b> and unaccented vowels that retain their original length. The dialect has developed two semivowels, now expressed as e and o. In the Žiri area a new pitch accent has developed.|$|R
50|$|Like the Rižana subdialect, the Šavrini Hills subdialect {{is based}} on {{characteristics}} of the Lower Carniolan and Littoral dialect groups. The Šavrini Hills subdialect is additionally based on a mixture of Slovene, Croatian, and Serbian dialect elements connected with the settlement of the Uskoks in Istria in the 16th and 17th centuries. <b>Accented</b> <b>vowels</b> {{do not have a}} length contrast. The vowel system differs from the Rižana subdialect in that the long <b>accented</b> <b>vowels</b> are monophthongal. Verbal conjugation lacks the dual. The Šavrini Hills subdialect shares many lexical features with the Rižana subdialect, with many loanwords from Romance languages.|$|R
50|$|Unicode {{includes}} few precomposed accented Cyrillic letters; {{the others}} can be combined by adding U+0301 ("combining acute accent") after the <b>accented</b> <b>vowel</b> (e.g., ы́ э́ ю́ я́) (see below).|$|E
50|$|The {{repetition}} of identical or similar sounds, usually <b>accented</b> <b>vowel</b> sounds and succeeding consonant sounds {{at the end}} of words, and often at the ends of lines of prose or poetry.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>accented</b> <b>vowel</b> {{letters are}} derived from their base letters through {{stretching}} or reflection as follows. The traditional letter for q (which {{is not part of}} the basic Hungarian alphabet) has been reassigned to ö, and an unused pattern has been assigned to ü: ...|$|E
5000|$|If other {{letters are}} needed, such as j, k, w, x, y or <b>accented</b> <b>vowels</b> such as î, French Braille {{assignments}} are used. [...] j {{is of course}} used as the digit 0.|$|R
5000|$|In Slovene, several advancings and {{retractions}} of {{the accent}} have occurred so {{it no longer}} reflects the original position as neatly. All non-accented vowels were shortened, and all non-final <b>accented</b> <b>vowels</b> were lengthened.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Accented</b> <b>vowels</b> {{represent}} stressed (or [...] "hard" [...] vowels). Repeating a vowel lengthens it. [...] Thus, tonals {{are marked}} by arranging {{the location of a}} stressed vowel in a lengthened pair, like [...] and [...]|$|R
5000|$|In 1994, the RAE {{ruled that}} the Spanish consonants [...] "CH" [...] (...) and [...] "LL" [...] (...) would hence be alphabetized under [...] "C" [...] and under [...] "L", respectively, and not as separate, {{discrete}} letters, as in the past. The RAE eliminated monosyllabic accented vowels where the accent did not serve in changing the word's meaning, examples include: [...] "" [...] ("gave"), [...] "" [...] ("saw"), both had an acutely <b>accented</b> <b>vowel</b> [...] ""; yet the monosyllabic word [...] "" [...] ("I know", the first person, singular, present of [...] "", [...] "to know"; and the singular imperative of [...] "", [...] "to be") retains its acutely <b>accented</b> <b>vowel</b> in order to differentiate it from the reflexive pronoun [...] "".|$|E
50|$|The accents (τόνοι, {{singular}} τόνος) {{are placed}} on an <b>accented</b> <b>vowel</b> or on {{the last of the}} two vowels of a diphthong (ά, but αί) and indicated pitch patterns in Ancient Greek. The precise nature of the patterns is not certain, but the general nature of each is known.|$|E
50|$|When a noun, pronoun, adjective, or verb {{has a long}} vowel or diphthong in the accented {{syllable}} and its stem ends in a single -l, -n, or -s, the -r (or the elder r- or z-variant ʀ) in an ending is assimilated. When the <b>accented</b> <b>vowel</b> is short, the ending is dropped.|$|E
50|$|The {{pronunciation}} of the <b>accented</b> <b>vowels</b> {{is fairly}} stable {{except that they}} become nasal in certain conditions. See #Nasalization for further information about this regular phenomenon. In other cases, nasal vowels are marked with a tilde.|$|R
40|$|In the February 1976 Word Ways, Maxey Brooke defines rhyme as 2 ̆ 2 the {{identity}} in sounds, of the <b>accented</b> <b>vowels</b> of words, usually {{the last one}} accented, and of all consonantal and vowel sounds following, with {{a difference in the}} sound of the consonants immediately preceding the <b>accented</b> <b>vowels.</b> 2 ̆ 2 Masculine rhymes have the final syllable accented, feminine rhymes have the penultimate syllable accented; and triple rhymes have the third-from-last syllable accented. Rhymes with the following consonants somewhat different are called vowel rhyme or assonance; rhymes with identical consonant sounds but slightly different vowel sounds are called off rhyme, sour rhyme, analyzed rhyme or consonance...|$|R
50|$|Prosodical system diverges {{from that}} of other Chakavian speeches, having lost e.g. the {{difference}} between long a short <b>accented</b> <b>vowels.</b> Another unusual feature is the usage of Kajkavian interrogative pronoun kaj 'what', {{instead of the usual}} Chakavian ča.|$|R
5000|$|Modern Greek has {{a stress}} accent, similar to English. The accent is notated with a stroke (΄) over the <b>accented</b> <b>vowel</b> and is called [...] (oxeia, [...] "acute") or [...] (tonos, [...] "accent") in Greek. The former term {{is taken from}} one of the accents used in polytonic orthography which officially became {{obsolete}} in 1982.|$|E
50|$|Stress helps {{predict the}} tones {{of all the}} vowels in a word: {{stressed}} vowels are high in pitch; all vowels following the stressed vowel are low in pitch; all short vowels preceding the stressed vowel are low in pitch; all long vowels preceding the stressed vowel are high in pitch; short vowels occurring between a long vowel and the <b>accented</b> <b>vowel</b> assimilate to a high pitch.|$|E
5000|$|In Italian, {{the graphic}} accent {{is needed in}} words ending with an <b>accented</b> <b>vowel,</b> e.g. città, [...] "city", and in some monosyllabic words that might {{otherwise}} be confused with other words, like là ("there") and la ("the"). It is optional for it to be written on any vowel if there is a possibility of misunderstanding, such as condomìni ("condominiums") and condòmini ("joint owners"). See [...]|$|E
5000|$|The {{consonant}} digraphs {{are derived}} from their base letters as follows. The traditional letter for z has been replaced, and is used for a parenthesis. As with the <b>accented</b> <b>vowels,</b> the majority of digraphs are created through reflection: ...|$|R
25|$|Soon afterwards, E.M. Siddique took a {{different}} approach, using Latin letters only. The result is a writing system known as Rohingyalish that comprises 26 Roman letters, five <b>accented</b> <b>vowels,</b> and two additional Latin characters for retroflex and nasal sounds.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Accented</b> <b>vowels,</b> {{marked with}} an acute accent, {{represent}} stressed (or [...] "hard" [...] vowels), and repeating a vowel lengthens it. [...] Thus, tonals {{are marked by}} arranging {{the location of a}} stressed vowel in a lengthened pair, like [...] and [...]|$|R
50|$|High tone is {{indicated}} with an acute accent (´), low tone with a grave accent (`), and falling tone with an acute accent {{followed by a}} grave accent. A long vowel with falling tone is represented by two <b>accented</b> <b>vowel</b> letters (áà). When the vowel is short, the grave accent is placed over the next consonant (áǹ):An epenthetic ə vowel appears in kl, kw and kn clusters in careful speech.|$|E
5000|$|The acute {{accent and}} the {{circumflex}} accent {{indicate that a}} vowel is stressed {{and the quality of}} the <b>accented</b> <b>vowel</b> and, more precisely, its height: á, é, and ó are low vowels (except in nasal vowels); â, ê, and ô are high vowels. They also distinguish a few homographs: por [...] "by" [...] with pôr [...] "to put", pode [...] "he/she/it can" [...] with pôde [...] "he/she/it could".|$|E
5000|$|Plosives [...] may be voiced [...] between vowels {{and after}} nasals. Both [...] and [...] are {{realized}} as , and [...] becomes [...] before [...] {{and at the}} end of syllables. There is some variation among dialects; in the Sakhalin dialect, syllable-final , , , [...] lenited and merged into [...] After an , this [...] is pronounced [...] A glottal stop [...] is often inserted at the beginning of words, before an <b>accented</b> <b>vowel,</b> but is non-phonemic.|$|E
50|$|The area is {{most often}} {{associated}} with the larger American South. People who {{have grown up in}} the Hampton Roads area have a unique Tidewater accent which sounds different from a stereotypical Southern <b>accent.</b> <b>Vowels</b> have a longer pronunciation than in a regular southern accent.|$|R
50|$|The {{grave and}} acute accents in {{particular}} are very often omitted in casual writing, {{and the same is}} true to a lesser extent of the diaeresis. The circumflex, however, is usually included. <b>Accented</b> <b>vowels</b> are not considered distinct letters for the purpose of collation.|$|R
5000|$|First, {{this narrow}} type of [...] "e-text" [...] {{is limited to}} the English letters. Not even Spanish ñ or the <b>accented</b> <b>vowels</b> used in many European {{languages}} cannot be represented (unless awkwardly and ambiguously as [...] "~n" [...] "a'"). Asian, Slavic, Greek, and other writing systems are right out.|$|R
