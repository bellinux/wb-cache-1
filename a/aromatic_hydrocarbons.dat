Biodegradation was assessed by comparison of total polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> substrate recovery in degradation flasks relative to sterile control flasks. During 1977 field studies, the mean phenanthrene biodegradation was approximately 80 % after a 4 -week incubation. Within a given habitat, 45 % of the total variability in phenanthrene biodegradation was attributable to the physical, chemical, and microbiological site characteristics examined.

5|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} reported {{detecting the}} spectral signatures of anthracene and pyrene in the ultraviolet light emitted by the Red Rectangle nebula (no other such complex molecules {{had ever been}} found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward. As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond {{to each other in}} various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred that since they discovered polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PAHs) — which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth — in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.|$|E

OSV stacking structures of Co/AlOx/CNAP/Ni 80 Fe 20 with different CNAP thicknesses were fabricated, and the transport properties of the OSVs were measured from 300 to 5 K.

5|$|Many comets and asteroids {{collided}} with Earth {{in its early}} stages. Many scientists think that comets bombarding the young Earth about 4 billion years ago brought the vast quantities of water that now fill the Earth's oceans, {{or at least a}} significant portion of it. Others have cast doubt on this idea. The detection of organic molecules, including polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> in significant quantities in comets has led to speculation that comets or meteorites may have brought the precursors of life—or even life itself—to Earth. In 2013 it was suggested that impacts between rocky and icy surfaces, such as comets, had the potential to create the amino acids that make up proteins through shock synthesis. In 2015, scientists found significant amounts of molecular oxygen in the outgassings of comet 67P, suggesting that the molecule may occur more often than had been thought, and thus less an indicator of life as has been supposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{amorphous}} form is {{an assortment}} of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline, irregular, glassy state, not held in a crystalline macrostructure. It is present as a powder, and is the main constituent of substances such as charcoal, lampblack (soot) and activated carbon. At normal pressures, carbon {{takes the form of}} graphite, in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused hexagonal rings, just like those in <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak van der Waals forces. This gives graphite its softness and its cleaving properties (the sheets slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a π-cloud, graphite conducts electricity, but only in the plane of each covalently bonded sheet. This results in a lower bulk electrical conductivity for carbon than for most metals. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature.|$|E
