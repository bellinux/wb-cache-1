5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and <b>angled</b> towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also <b>angled</b> to the right.|$|E
5|$|Improper {{adherence}} to these flag dimensions {{have led to}} embarrassing diplomatic incidents. During the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Chinese flags used during the opening ceremony and two medal ceremonies featured the four small stars incorrectly <b>angled</b> in the same direction, inciting fury in the Olympic organisers.|$|E

50|$|The next {{match was}} between Kurt <b>Angle</b> and Chris Benoit for the WWE Championship. Team <b>Angle</b> (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) were ejected from ringside after interfering. Benoit {{attempted}} a Diving Headbutt on <b>Angle</b> but <b>Angle</b> avoided the move and attempted an <b>Angle</b> Slam on Benoit but Benoit countered. Benoit applied the Sharpshooter on <b>Angle</b> but <b>Angle</b> touched the ropes. <b>Angle</b> attempted an <b>Angle</b> Slam but Benoit countered the {{move into the}} Crippler Crossface on <b>Angle</b> but <b>Angle</b> touched the ropes. Benoit applied the Ankle Lock on <b>Angle</b> until <b>Angle</b> countered the hold into an Ankle Lock on Benoit. Benoit countered the hold into the Crippler Crossface but <b>Angle</b> countered the move into an <b>Angle</b> Slam for a near-fall. Benoit executed a Diving Headbutt for a near-fall. <b>Angle</b> performed a Super <b>Angle</b> Slam for a near-fall. Benoit applied a Crippler Crossface on <b>Angle</b> but <b>Angle</b> countered it into an Ankle Lock, forcing Benoit {{to submit to the}} hold to retain the title.|$|R
50|$|Proof: Since <b>angle</b> BDA {{is a right}} <b>angle,</b> <b>angle</b> DBA equals π/2 minus <b>angle</b> DAB. However, <b>angle</b> DAH also equals π/2 minus <b>angle</b> DAB (since <b>angle</b> HAB is a right <b>angle).</b> Therefore triangles DBA and DAH are similar. Therefore <b>angle</b> DIA equals <b>angle</b> DOH, where I is the {{midpoint}} of BA and O is {{the midpoint}} of AH. But AOH is a straight line, so <b>angle</b> DOH and DOA are supplementary <b>angles.</b> Therefore the sum of <b>angles</b> DIA and DOA is π. <b>Angle</b> IAO is a right <b>angle.</b> The sum of the <b>angles</b> in any quadrilateral is 2π, so in quadrilateral IDOA, <b>angle</b> IDO must be a right <b>angle.</b> But ADHE is a rectangle, so the midpoint O of AH (the rectangle's diagonal) is also the midpoint of DE (the rectangle's other diagonal). As I (defined as the midpoint of BA) {{is the center of}} semicircle BA, and <b>angle</b> IDE is a right <b>angle,</b> then DE is tangent to semicircle BA at D. By analogous reasoning DE is tangent to semicircle AC at E. Q.E.D.|$|R
5|$|In flight, the red-throated loon has a {{distinctive}} profile; its small feet do not project far past {{the end of}} its body, its head and neck droop below the horizontal (giving the flying bird a distinctly hunchbacked shape) and its thin wings are <b>angled</b> back. It has a quicker, deeper wingbeat than do other loons.|$|E
5|$|Like {{a number}} of other delta-wing {{aircraft}} designed to cruise at very high speeds, the Valkyrie included a droop-nose that allowed the pilots to view the ground during the nose-high takeoff and landing. The Concorde or Tupolev Tu-144 both used a design where the entire nose section was <b>angled</b> downward, including outer window panels, exposing interior windows that were more vertically <b>angled.</b> In the B-70 design, only the upper section of the nose moved down into a fixed lower section, and the outer window panels moved with it to become more vertical, at 24degrees slope. With the nose raised into its high-speed position, the outer windows were almost horizontal. A system that blew 600F air from the engines was used for both defogging and rain removal. The lower forward section included a radar bay, and production machines were to be equipped with a refueling receptacle on the upper surface of the nose.|$|E
5|$|The plan {{included}} narrowing 3rd Avenue from four-lanes westbound {{towards the}} Robert C. Byrd Bridge to one-lane {{in each direction}} with <b>angled</b> parking, however, this was later revised to one-lane in each direction with parallel parking and a center variable lane. The road narrowing plan was envisioned as a traffic calming measure.|$|E
25|$|Let ABC be an {{isosceles}} triangle with AB and AC being the equal sides. Pick an arbitrary point D on side AB and construct E on AC so that AD=AE. Draw the lines BE, DC and DE. Consider the triangles BAE and CAD; BA=CA, AE=AD, and <b>angle</b> A {{is equal to}} itself, so by side-angle-side, the triangles are congruent and corresponding sides and <b>angles</b> are equal. Therefore <b>angle</b> ABE = <b>angle</b> ACD, <b>angle</b> ADC = <b>angle</b> AEB, and BE=CD. Since AB=AC and AD=AE, BD=CE by subtraction of equal parts. Now consider the triangles DBE and ECD; BD=CE, BE=CD, and <b>angle</b> DBE = <b>angle</b> ECD have just been shown, so applying side-angle-side again, the triangles are congruent. Therefore <b>angle</b> BDE = <b>angle</b> CED and <b>angle</b> BED = <b>angle</b> CDE. Since <b>angle</b> BDE = <b>angle</b> CED and <b>angle</b> CDE = <b>angle</b> BED, <b>angle</b> BDC = <b>angle</b> CEB by subtraction of equal parts. Consider a third pair of triangles, BDC and CEB; DB=EC, DC=EB, and <b>angle</b> BDC = <b>angle</b> CEB, so applying side-angle-side a third time, the triangles are congruent. In particular, <b>angle</b> CBD = BCE, {{which was to be}} proved.|$|R
50|$|Proclus' {{variation}} of Euclid's proof proceeds as follows: Let ABC be an isosceles triangle with AB and AC being the equal sides.

Consider the triangles BAE and CAD; BA=CA, AE=AD, and <b>angle</b> A {{is equal to}} itself, so by side-angle-side, the triangles are congruent and corresponding sides and <b>angles</b> are equal. Therefore <b>angle</b> ABE = <b>angle</b> ACD, <b>angle</b> ADC = <b>angle</b> AEB, and BE=CD. Since AB=AC and AD=AE, BD=CE by subtraction of equal parts.

5|$|When perched {{or between}} bouts of {{foraging}} on the ground, the flame robin holds {{itself in a}} relatively upright pose, with its body <b>angled</b> at 45° or less from the vertical, and its wings held low below its tail. It impresses as nervous and twitchy, flicking its wings alternately when still. The flame robin's flight is fast, with a markedly undulating character.|$|E
5|$|After the Act of Union of 1707, growing {{prosperity}} in Scotland {{led to a}} spate of new building, both public and private. The threat of Jacobite insurrection or invasion meant that Scotland saw more military building than England in this period. Military structures relied {{on the strength of}} inclined and <b>angled</b> engineered masonry and earthen toppings to deflect and absorb artillery fire. This spate of military building culminated in the construction of Fort George near Inverness (1748–69), with its projecting bastions and redoubts.|$|E
5|$|Although no flight-deck cruisers {{were ever}} {{built by the}} U.S. Navy, the Soviet Union's , {{developed}} in the 1970s, is remarkably {{similar to that of}} the original flight-deck cruiser design, featuring an <b>angled</b> flight deck aft with anti-ship missile launchers forwards. In addition, during the early 1980s, plans were proposed for the reactivation of the U.S. Navy's Iowa-class battleships that entailed the removal of each ship's aft turret and the installation of a flight deck for operating V/STOL aircraft; in the end a much more modest conversion, lacking the flight deck, was carried out.|$|E
25|$|In the figure, {{assume the}} measure of <b>Angle</b> A = x. When two {{adjacent}} <b>angles</b> form a straight line, they are supplementary. Therefore, {{the measure of}} <b>Angle</b> C = 180 − x. Similarly, the measure of <b>Angle</b> D = 180 − x. Both <b>Angle</b> C and <b>Angle</b> D have measures equal to 180 − x and are congruent. Since <b>Angle</b> B is supplementary to both <b>Angles</b> C and D, either of these <b>angle</b> measures {{may be used to}} determine the measure of <b>Angle</b> B. Using the measure of either <b>Angle</b> C or <b>Angle</b> D we find the measure of <b>Angle</b> B = 180 − (180 − x) = 180 − 180 + x = x. Therefore, both <b>Angle</b> A and <b>Angle</b> B have measures equal to x and are equal in measure.|$|R

They can most often be seen hovering with wings curved and tail pointing down.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, Hotze's {{advanced}} guard had encountered moderate French resistance first from Roget's brigade, and then, almost immediately, from Gazan's. The Austrian advance troops quickly overran Gazan's weak brigade and took {{possession of the}} woods surrounding the village of Islikon. After securing the villages of Gundeschwil, Schottikon, Wiesendangen, and Stogen, further west of Islikon, Hotze deployed two of his columns facing the French front, while a third <b>angled</b> to the French right, as Ney had expected he would.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine has two solid forms, α- and β-fluorine. The latter {{crystallizes}} at −220°C (−364°F) and is {{transparent and}} soft, {{with the same}} disordered cubic structure of freshly crystallized solid oxygen, unlike the orthorhombic systems of other solid halogens. Further cooling to −228°C (−378°F) induces a phase transition into opaque and hard α-fluorine, which has a monoclinic structure with dense, <b>angled</b> layers of molecules. The transition from β- to α-fluorine is more exothermic than the condensation of fluorine, and can be violent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Angle</b> of incidence: The {{deviation}} <b>angle</b> {{depends on}} the <b>angle</b> that the beam enters the object, called <b>angle</b> of incidence. The deviation <b>angle</b> first decreases with increasing incidence <b>angle,</b> and then it increases.|$|R
