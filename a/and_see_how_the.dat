25|$|In {{recent years}} {{researchers}} have developed various eye-movement simulation models {{in order to}} support, explain, and guide empirical research (the studies that collect data from experiments on human reading behaviours). Computational models can help test existing hypothesis, and also generate further predictions for empirical research to investigate. Building a reading model based on empirical data allows researchers to inspect and manipulate various assumptions of cognitive processes within the model, <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> interactions between these elements influence the simulated reading behaviours, and hence informs further empirical studies. On the other hand, empirical research in eye-movements using eye-tracking {{is one of the}} most delicate measurement of human behaviours, which serves as a productive test bed for computer models of cognition. Below is a brief summary of these reading models as classified by Nuthmann (2014).|$|E

500|$|In the Kingdom of Holland, the British {{launched}} the Walcheren Campaign {{to open up}} a second front in the war and to relieve the pressure on the Austrians. The British army only landed at Walcheren on 30 July, by which point the Austrians had already been defeated. The Walcheren Campaign was characterized by little fighting but heavy casualties thanks to the popularly dubbed [...] "Walcheren Fever". Over 4000 British troops were lost in a bungled campaign, and the rest withdrew in December 1809. The main strategic result from the campaign became the delayed political settlement between the French and the Austrians. Emperor Francis wanted to wait <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> British performed in their theater before entering into negotiations with Napoleon. Once it became apparent that the British were going nowhere, the Austrians agreed to peace talks.|$|E

500|$|To {{cut down}} on costs, the network also {{pressured}} Levinson to relocate filming to California rather than Baltimore, which would reduce costs for travel, lodging and meals. Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer sent a telegram to Levinson encouraging him {{to remain in the}} city: [...] "I wanted you to know that we are proud of having this exceptional series shot in your native state and stand ready to help toward a positive decision for additional production of the series." [...] Levinson and Fontana considered leaving Baltimore not only for the cost savings, but also because of the letters of outrage by the city's detectives over [...] "See No Evil," [...] as well as a report in the Associated Press that the show was giving Baltimore a bad image by drawing attention to its murder rate. Ultimately, however, Levinson decided to remain in Baltimore.

500|$|The first US vessel to {{participate}} in the mass evacuation was the , which left Haiphong on August 17. It carried 1,924refugees for a 1,600kilometre, three-day journey to the southern capital. By this time, there were already 132,000 people registered at the waiting areas, although very few had any identification. As a result, there would be more work to be done in identifying their needs once they arrived in the south. The [...] followed on the next day, with 2,100passengers. Both were originally built as attack transport vessels. In August, the US policy was liberalised so that Vietnamese and French military personnel could also be evacuated at the discretion of CTF-90 and the Chief Military Assistance Advisory Group (CHMAAG). To cope with the rising volume of southbound sea transport, CHMAAG established a refugee debarkation site at Vũng Tàu, a coastal port at the entrance of the Saigon River. This site relieved congestion in the Saigon refugee camps and decreased the traffic bottlenecks along the river. A setback occurred when a typhoon struck the Haiphong area, destroying almost half of the refugee staging area. Despite the problems, by September 3, the US Navy had evacuated 47,000northerners after only two weeks of operations. The high rate of evacuation caused the South Vietnamese government to order that only one shipment of at most 2,500passengers was to arrive in Saigon or Vũng Tàu per day, until September 25. The population pressure in the south was eased as incoming numbers fell due to Viet Minh propaganda campaigns and forcible detention, combined with the rice harvesting season, which had prompted some to delay their departure. Some were even waiting to finish all their business deals before moving in the Lunar New Year. On October 10, the Viet Minh were given full control of Hanoi, closing off one point of evacuation for those who wanted out. Some also decided to stay behind <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> Viet Minh would treat the inhabitants of Hanoi before making a decision on whether to leave their ancestral lands. On October 20, the French authorities that were still in control of the ports decided to waive docking fees on US vessels engaged in the evacuation. Because of the high demand, the naval vessels had to travel quickly; one ship completed one round trip in a record of only six days. The record for the most passengers taken in one journey was set by the USS General Black, which sailed on October 29 with 5,224 Vietnamese aboard. In November, the evacuation was further hampered by another typhoon, while the entire crew of one American vessel were struck down by a scabies outbreak. In December, because of Viet Minh obstruction, which prevented people from rural and regional areas from travelling to Hanoi and Haiphong to emigrate, the French Navy sent ships to hover just off the coast near the regional town of Vinh to evacuate refugees.|$|E

2500|$|A Rasmussen Reports poll done nationally {{around the}} time of the signing {{indicated}} that 60percent of Americans were in favor of and 31percent opposed to legislation that allows local police to [...] "stop and verify the immigration status of anyone they suspect of being an illegal immigrant." [...] The same poll also indicated that 58percent are at least somewhat concerned that [...] "efforts to identify and deport illegal immigrants will also end up violating the civil rights of some U.S. citizens." [...] A national Gallup Poll found that more than three-quarters of Americans had heard about the law, and of those who had, 51percent were in favor of it against 39percent opposed. [...] An Angus Reid Public Opinion poll indicated that 71percent of Americans said they supported the notion of requiring their own police to determine people's status if there was [...] "reasonable suspicion" [...] the people were illegal immigrants, and arresting those people if they could not prove they were legally in the United States. [...] A nationwide New York Times/CBS News poll found similar results to the others, with 51percent of respondents saying the Arizona law was [...] "about right" [...] in its approach to the problem of illegal immigration, 36percent saying it went too far, and 9percent saying it did not go far enough. [...] Another CBS News poll, conducted a month after the signing, showed 52percent seeing the law as about right, 28percent thinking it goes too far, and 17percent thinking it does not go far enough. [...] A 57percent majority thought that the federal government should be responsible for determining immigration law. [...] A national Fox News poll found that 61percent of respondents thought Arizona was right to take action itself rather than wait for federal action, and 64percent thought the Obama administration should wait <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> law works in practice rather than trying to stop it right away.
