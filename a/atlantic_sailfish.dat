50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sailfish</b> is a {{pelagic fish}} of {{tropical}} and temperate {{waters in the}} Atlantic Ocean. It ranges from approximately 40°N in the northwestern Atlantic to 40°S in the southwestern Atlantic, and 50°N in the northeastern Atlantic to 32°S in the southeastern Atlantic. It is a migratory species and moves about the open ocean and into the Mediterranean Sea. Its depth range is from warm surface waters down to about 200 m.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sailfish</b> is a {{metallic}} blue fish {{with a large}} sail-like dorsal fin and a long and pointed bill-like snout. It is dark bluish-black on the upperparts and lighter on the sides (counter-shading), with about twenty bluish horizontal bars along the flanks; the underparts are silvery white. The tail fin is strongly forked. The fins are bluish-black and the front dorsal fin is speckled with small black spots. The bases of the anal fins are pale.|$|E
50|$|Bony fish, Marlins, sea birds, sharks, and rays prey on {{the little}} tunny. Other tunas, {{including}} conspecifics and yellowfin tuna (Thynnus albacares) are predators of the little tunny. Fish such as the dolphin fish (Coryphaena hippurus), wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri), <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sailfish</b> (Istiophorus albicans), swordfish (Xiphias gladius), and various sharks {{as well as other}} large marine carnivores all prey {{on the little}} tunny. Among those sharks is the whale shark, who feeds on the little tunny's recently spawned eggs. Seabirds prey on small little tunny.|$|E
50|$|The marine fish found off Mauritania's coast are an {{important}} resource for commercial, subsistence and sport fishing, estimates put the potential catch at between 400,000 and 700,000 tons. The rich waters off the Mauritanian coast are host {{to a variety of}} species more familiar in more northerly temperate waters such as European seabass, European hake, Norwegian skate and Gilt-head bream, as well as species more typical of warmer waters including whale shark, Atlantic bluefin tuna, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sailfish,</b> tarpon and Atlantic blue marlin 56 species of freshwater fish have been reported from Mauritania of which 50 have been confirmed as occurring.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sailfish</b> (Istiophorus platypterus) is {{considered}} over-fished in U. S. waters. Furthermore, preliminary analyses of abundance {{indicate that a}} decline in biomass has occurred. While seminal studies have provided useful baseline data about intra- and inter-oceanic variation within sailfish, such studies may have underestimated the amount of genetic variability {{as a result of}} small sample sizes and the poor resolution of restriction fragment length polymorphism data. We used 263 base pairs from the hypervariable mitochondrial control region and fragment polymorphisms from five microsatellite loci to assess the contemporary population structure between eastern (n = 30) and western (n = 192) <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sailfish</b> stocks. We failed to reject the hypothesis of panmixia in Atlantic sailfish; however, higher levels of genetic variation were observed within the eastern <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sailfish,</b> and the nature of this difference needs to be investigated further. Having found no evidence of transatlantic differentiation, we pooled the Atlantic samples (n = 222) and compared them to a sample from the eastern Pacific (n = 22) and rejected the null hypothesis, concluding that sailfish from separate ocean basins do not share a common gene pool. We also found evidence of a recent sudden expansion of Clade I (the ubiquitous clade found in both Atlantic and Pacific Oceans) sailfish into the Atlantic that appears to have occurred between 164000 and 351000 years ago, coinciding with interglacial periods during the Pleistocene. This study also presents the first evidence of a recent sudden expansion of sailfish into the eastern Pacific, roughly 85400 to 173000 years ago, following a period when cooling in the eastern Pacific would have restricted the sailfish range to the warmer waters of the western Indo-Pacific. We emphasize that sailfish from this region of the Pacific are phenotypically distinct from those {{in the rest of the}} species' range and encourage further studies in order to determine if the eastern Pacific sailfish population should be managed as a separate stock...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{basis of}} stock {{structure}} of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sailfish</b> (Istiophorus platypterus) was investigated using {{analyses of the}} mitochondrial control region and three nuclear microsatellite loci. Relatively robust samples (n = 293) from 6 locations throughout the Atlantic were screened for variation at these four hypervariable gene regions. While considerable variation was revealed, {{almost all of the}} variation was present in individual samples. The null hypothesis that samples were drawn from a common gene pool could not be rejected when each sample location was considered separately, or when collections were combined into eastern and western Atlantic samples. The apparent genetic homogeneity reinforces recent reports on the distribution of sailfish across the Atlantic and calls to question the current application of eastern and western Atlantic stocks.

ABSTRACT: The dynamics of the exploited population of Istiophorus albicans (<b>Atlantic</b> <b>sailfish)</b> from artisanal gillnet fishery was investigated based on length frequency data, using FiSAT software. Specimens were sampled from the artisanal fishery captures in the coastal waters near Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire), from October 2009 to October 2010. Growth parameters of I. albicans were estimated using ELEFAN I method. The asymptotic length (L∞), the growth rate constant (K) and the theoretical age at length zero (t 0) were estimated to be 231. 6 cm fork length, 0. 48 yr − 1 and 0. 49 yrs, respectively. The estimated growth performance index (Ф’) of I. albicans was 4. 41. Instantaneous of total mortality coefficient estimated by non seasonalized length converted catch curves (Z) was 1. 56 yr − 1. Natural mortality (M) estimated by Pauly’s empirical equation was 0. 63 yr − 1 and the estimated fishing mortality (F) was 0. 93 y...|$|E
40|$|To {{estimate}} post-release {{survival of}} sailfish caught incidentally to regular commercial pelagic longline fishing {{operations in the}} southern Gulf of Mexico targeting mixed swordfish and tunas, 18 pop-up satellite archival tags were deployed on incidentally captured animals. A total of 17 tags transmitted following the full 10 -day deployment period, transmitting 25 - 82 % of the archived data. (Three tags were returned, allowing for 100 % recovery of the archived data.) Repeated, short-duration movements to depth throughout the tag deployment duration and horizontal displacement data were consistent with survival for 15 of 17 animals (88. 2 %) for the ten-day deployment period. The short-duration behavior recorded by the tags also showed repeated movements to depths well below the measured effective fishing depths of the common types of pelagic longline fishing gear used in this geographic area. The {{results of this study}} clearly indicate that a large percentage of sailfish can survive the trauma resulting from interaction with pelagic longline gear, and that current domestic and international management measures promoting the release of sailfish from pelagic longline fisheries will reduce fishing mortality on the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sailfish</b> stocks...|$|E
40|$|Trophic {{relations}} of cephalopods in southern Brazil were investigated from predation on cephalopods by 71 species of potential predators, including two squids, 47 fishes, seven seabirds and 15 marine mammals from shelf, upper slope and oceanic adjacent waters. In all, 27 families and 41 species of cephalopods were identified from stomach contents. The {{number of families}} ranged from six, in the diet of shelf predators, to 27 families in those from upper slope and adjacent oceanic waters. The most frequent cephalopod prey on the shelf was Loligo sanpaulensis, particularly important in the diet of Franciscana dolphin Pontoporia blainvillei, occurring also in the diet of the penguin Spheniscus magellanicus, the fur seals Arctocephalus australis, A. gazella, A. tropicalis, and several benthic and demersal fishes. Ommastrephidae, mainly Illex argentinus and Ornithoteuthis antillarum, was the most frequent family in the diet of predators from upper slope and adjacent oceanic waters. Illex argentinus was an important prey for the wreckfish Polyprion americanus, the bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus, the swordfish Xiphias gladius and some marine mammals, especially in their winter and spring northward reproductive migration. Ornithoteuthis antillarum was frequent in the diet of the skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis, the albacore Thunnus alalunga, the yellowfin tuna T. albacares, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sailfish</b> Istiophorus albicans and the white marlin Tetrapturus albidus. Ammoniacal squids, such as Ancistrocheirus lesueurii, Histioteuthis spp, Chiroteuthis veranii and Octopoteuthis sp, were mainly found in stomach contents of the blue shark, Prionace glauca, the pygmy sperm whale Kogia breviceps, the dwarf sperm whale K. sima, the long-finned pilot whale, Globicephala melas and oceanic seabirds. The relative importance, based on frequency of occurrence, of cephalopods as food resources seems to be higher in the food chains of the upper slope and adjacent oceanic waters, {{when compared to the}} continental shelf...|$|E
40|$|Sailfish, Istiophorus platypterus, are {{commonly}} {{taken by the}} recreational and commercial fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) and larvae are frequently reported in the region, indicating the Gulf's potential role as spawning and/or nursery ground of sailfish. Five ichthyoplankton surveys were conducted in shelf and slope waters of the northern Gulf during the summers of 2005 (May, July, September) and 2006 (June, August). Surveys were conducted off the Texas and Louisiana coasts from 27 - 28 N and 88 - 94 W. During the two year study, 2, 426 sailfish larvae were collected, {{ranging in size from}} 2. 0 - 24. 3 mm standard length (SL). Sailfish larvae were collected in 45. 0 % of collections with a peak density ranging of 51. 5 larvae per 1000 m- 2 of water sampled, and the highest larval abundances were observed within frontal features of the Loop Current. Sagittal otoliths were extracted from 1, 236 larvae, and otolith microstructure analysis indicated sailfish ranged in age from 5 - 25 days post-hatch. Hatch-date distributions indicated fish were from early May to mid September spawning and/or hatching events. Instantaneous growth coefficients (g) ranged from 0. 113 to 0. 127 with intra- and inter-annual variations in growth observed. Growth coefficients correspond to a 10. 7 - 11. 9 % increase in length per day. Instantaneous daily mortality rates (Z) were estimated from regressions of the decline in loge-transformed abundance on age and ranged from 20. 4 % to 29. 2 % per day suggesting large losses during the early life interval. Instantaneous weight-specific growth coefficients (G) ranged from 41. 5 % to 45. 9 % per day and were indexed to daily mortality to assess intra- and inter-annual variation in recruitment potential. Recruitment indices > 1. 0 were observed during all surveys, suggesting cohort biomass was increasing and that conditions were favorable for growth, survival and recruitment. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the northern Gulf represents viable spawning and nursery habitat of sailfish and the sustainability of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>sailfish</b> populations may be linked to spawning in the Gulf...|$|E
