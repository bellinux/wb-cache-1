5|$|Mici {{had been}} a student in Pittsburgh, and wanted {{to return to the}} United States. Her chance came in 1935, when, thanks to George Gamow, Teller was invited to the United States to become a Professor of Physics <b>at</b> <b>George</b> Washington University, where he worked with Gamow until 1941. <b>At</b> <b>George</b> Washington University in 1937, Teller {{predicted}} the Jahn–Teller effect, which distorts molecules in certain situations; this affects the chemical reactions of metals, and in particular the coloration of certain metallic dyes. Teller and Hermann Arthur Jahn analyzed it as a piece of purely mathematical physics. In collaboration with Stephen Brunauer and Paul Hugh Emmett, Teller also made an important contribution to surface physics and chemistry: the so-called Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) isotherm. Teller and Mici became naturalized citizens of the United States on March 6, 1941.|$|E

5|$|He {{attended}} Brooklyn Preparatory, a Jesuit school, on {{a scholarship}} and graduated as class valedictorian in 1946. He later attended Georgetown University on a scholarship, where {{he earned his}} bachelor's degree in English in 1950. Those years at Georgetown were probably {{the best years of}} my life, Blatty said in 2015. Until then, I’d never had a home. While studying for his master's degree <b>at</b> <b>George</b> Washington University, Blatty took menial jobs. Initially unable to find a job in teaching, he worked as a vacuum cleaner door-to-door salesman, a beer truck driver, and as a United Airlines ticket agent. He earned his master's in English literature from the George Washington University in 1954. He then enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he ultimately became head of the Policy Branch of the USAF Psychological Warfare Division.|$|E

Campbell was seven years younger than Milk, and Milk pursued him passionately. Even after they moved in together, Milk wrote Campbell romantic notes and poems. Growing bored with their New York lives, they {{decided to move to}} Dallas, Texas, but they were unhappy there and moved back to New York, where Milk got a job as an actuarial statistician at an insurance firm.

5|$|On Tuesday 7 August, {{following}} a Monday bank holiday, prostitute Martha Tabram was murdered at about 2:30am. Her {{body was found}} <b>at</b> <b>George</b> Yard Buildings, George Yard, Whitechapel. She had been stabbed 39times with a short blade. On the basis of statements from a fellow prostitute, and PC Thomas Barrett who was patrolling nearby, Inspector Reid put soldiers at the Tower of London and Wellington Barracks on an identification parade, but without positive results. The police did not connect the murder with Smith's, but they did connect it with the later murders. Most experts today do not connect it with the other killings, as Tabram was stabbed whereas the later victims were slashed, but a connection cannot be ruled out.|$|E
