5|$|The young {{municipality}} got {{its first}} boost in 1889 when Frank Ross and James McLaren opened {{what would become}} Fraser Mills, a $350,000, then state-of-the-art lumber mill on the north bank of the Fraser River. The District of Coquitlam was incorporated in 1891. By 1908, <b>a</b> <b>mill</b> town of 20 houses, a store, post office, hospital, office block, barber shop, and pool hall had grown around the mill. <b>A</b> <b>mill</b> manager's residence was built that would later become Place des Arts.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of village life there was <b>a</b> <b>mill,</b> a chapel house {{consisting}} of a church and a priest's residence, and a school. However, despite there being a continuous population on Mingulay {{for at least two}} thousand years, evacuations began in 1907 and the island was completely abandoned by its residents in 1912.|$|E
5|$|Nathan Beach {{constructed}} <b>a</b> <b>mill</b> on Big Wapwallopen Creek in the Wapwallopen Gorge in 1795. The mill eventually {{burned down}} by accident. Cornelius Garrison built <b>a</b> <b>mill</b> on the creek in southwestern Wright Township in 1833. <b>A</b> <b>mill</b> owned by Samuel Heller was operational on the creek {{as late as}} the late 1800s. In 1856, William Silver also built a powder mill in the Wapwallopen Gorge. He then sold partial ownership of the mill to G.P. Parrish. However, early in 1859, a freshet and an explosion destroyed the mill and caused Silver's and Parrish's company went bankrupt. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company bought the site in April 1859 and constructed the powder mills known as the Wapwallopen Mills there. At that time, the mills were one of the largest powder mills in the United States. While the mills were in operation, there were fatal explosions every eight years and the infrastructure was destroyed by flooding numerous times. However, by 1868, the mills were producing 70,000 tons of black powder per year. The mills operated until 1912, when the Du Pont company moved the machinery to Moosic due to increasing costs of shipping black powder and also a desire to consolidate operations. Only ruins remain today. There were still some gristmills on the creek as late as 1955.|$|E

5|$|The mill {{stands on}} a site where <b>a</b> <b>mill</b> was first {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book, but the present building was constructed around 1780. It closed in 1962 but was restored in 1979 and is still used to grind flour. The equipment is powered by two overshot wheels. It {{is owned by the}} National Trust but operated as a tourist attraction by a private company.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{surviving}} documentation for {{the creation}} of Van Cortlandt Lake. In 1699, Jacobus Van Cortlandt dammed Tibbetts Brook to power a sawmill, creating <b>a</b> <b>mill</b> pond at the site where the lake is. Later, he also added a gristmill. The sawmill was relocated around 1823 and stayed in operation until 1889. The gristmill was destroyed by lightning in 1901.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a new area. Every business except for <b>a</b> <b>mill</b> was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E
5000|$|Kornegay {{worked at}} <b>a</b> steel <b>mill,</b> Century Foundry, in Tuscaloosa and later {{described}} his working life as [...] "From a plow to a preacher, from a preacher to <b>a</b> steel <b>mill,</b> from <b>a</b> steel <b>mill</b> to <b>a</b> veneer <b>mill.</b> Double shifts I worked. And a cotton sack, and a plow, and <b>a</b> saw <b>mill,</b> and <b>a</b> paper <b>mill,</b> {{and all that}} stuff: {{had to make a}} living for my people".|$|R
50|$|A {{decade and}} a half later, the Helliwell family, who had emigrated from Todmorden, England, a town between the {{counties}} of Lancashire and Yorkshire, settled down in the Don area and renamed it Todmorden in memory of their hometown. The community of Todmorden soon became a bustling and significant industrial centre, with influential and ambitious families such as the Skinners, the Helliwells, the Eastwoods, and the Taylors who over the generations had successfully built and ran <b>a</b> series of <b>mills</b> (including <b>a</b> paper <b>mill,</b> <b>a</b> tin <b>mill,</b> <b>a</b> flour <b>mill,</b> <b>a</b> gristmill, and <b>a</b> sharpening <b>mill),</b> <b>a</b> brewery, a malthouse, a distillery, and the Don Valley Brick Works.|$|R

5|$|A {{water mill}} and Mill Hill were {{mentioned}} in a grant in 1544. Water power was in general use in Rivington and many houses including the hall had water-mills. The {{one at the}} hall was once used to churn butter. The foundations of {{what could have been}} <b>a</b> <b>mill</b> opposite Mill Hill Cottages on Rivington Lane, mill ponds, and a smithy were shown on the 1848 first edition Ordnance Survey map. Names such as Mill Hill and Mill Dam Wood also provide evidence of the former mill.|$|E
5|$|Another {{charter of}} Theobald's from about 1152 shows the usual {{household}} staff that surrounded him. It was witnessed by the archbishop's crossbearer, three of Theobald's nephews and the clerk who presumably {{was in charge}} of them, a chancellor, two chaplains who were monks, a butler, dispenser, chamberlain, steward, cook, usher, porter and marshal. Theobald also {{at about the same time}} granted <b>a</b> <b>mill</b> to his baker named William and some lands to his cook William and the cook's heirs.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1066 Norman {{conquest of}} England, {{the land and}} {{properties}} of Aldermaston formed part of the estates of Harold Godwinson, the Earl of Wessex, who later became King Harold II of England. Harold's assessment of Aldermaston valued the village's 15 hides at £20 a year. As {{with much of the}} land seized by William the Conqueror after his arrival in England in 1066, Aldermaston was held in demesne. His Domesday Survey of 1086 identified the existence of <b>a</b> <b>mill,</b> worth twenty shillings, and two fisheries, worth five shillings. During the rest of William's reign, and that of his son William Rufus, Aldermaston was owned by the Crown.|$|E
50|$|The Little Ossipee River {{runs through}} Newfield village and once {{provided}} water power to operate two gristmills, two lumber <b>mills,</b> <b>a</b> barrel stave <b>mill,</b> <b>a</b> shook <b>mill,</b> <b>a</b> planing <b>mill</b> and <b>a</b> carding <b>mill.</b> West Newfield had a sawmill, gristmill and stave <b>mill.</b> There was <b>an</b> attempt {{in the community}} to mine silver and iron, {{but it was not}} profitable. By 1880, the population was 995. Newfield would be heavily damaged by the Great Fires of 1947.|$|R
50|$|West Liberty {{was laid}} out in 1817. In 1833, West Liberty {{contained}} five stores, two taverns, one tannery, <b>a</b> merchant <b>mill,</b> <b>a</b> saw <b>mill,</b> <b>a</b> carding machine, and about 20 residential houses.|$|R

5|$|By 1989, the {{building}} still housed La Tasca, La Cantina, and Tabaquero, {{but the other}} shops were replaced by a sports shop. La Tasca was replaced in the 2000s by Starbucks coffee shop, and the Streetwear store replaced La Cantina in 2005. An outdoor Mr. Sub counter franchise operated from 2004 to 2012, this location and two others became Subway in 2013. In 2015, <b>a</b> <b>Mill</b> Street Brewery outlet was added next to it.|$|E
5|$|In 1799, a schoolhouse was {{constructed}} on West Creek near Benton. It {{was one of}} the first schoolhouses in the vicinity of Benton. During the 1864 elections, at least two Union soldiers were stationed on the creek, guarding the polling venues. <b>A</b> <b>mill</b> called the Thomas Mill was built on the creek in 1865 and remained operational in 1914, when it was owned by N.B. Cole. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, there was a timber-producing business on the creek, run by J. Harvey Creveling.|$|E
5|$|On 19 May, some {{residents}} of Jerusalem's Silwan neighborhood informed rebel leaders {{that they could}} use a sewer tunnel that ran from the Dung Gate to <b>a</b> <b>mill</b> in the Jewish Quarter, to clandestinely enter Jerusalem. The next day, 36 rebels (peasants and Jerusalemites) {{under the leadership of}} Sheikh Subh Shawkah, chief of the Bethlehem-area Fawaghirah tribe, entered the city via the tunnel and then opened the Dung Gate to allow thousands of rebels inside the walled city. The Egyptian commander of the city, Rashad Bey, subsequently withdrew his garrison into Jerusalem's citadel to take up positions against the incoming rebels.|$|E
50|$|Textile mills gave Milton its name. In the 19th century {{there was}} <b>a</b> carding <b>mill</b> downstream, <b>a</b> weaving <b>mill</b> by the bridge, and <b>a</b> fulling <b>mill</b> upstream.|$|R

50|$|In 1766, the Daniel Parks {{family was}} the first family to settle into the area after {{receiving}} 800 acre of land, on which they built a house and <b>a</b> saw <b>mill.</b> By the mid-1830s, the settlement boasted saw <b>mills,</b> <b>a</b> grist <b>mill,</b> <b>a</b> cotton <b>mill</b> and <b>a</b> quarry {{as well as a}} dock to facilitate commerce.|$|R
5|$|Royton has the {{distinction}} of being the first town where a powered cotton mill was built; at Thorp in 1764, {{and is one of the}} first localities in the world to have adopted the factory system. The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution facilitated a process of unplanned urbanisation in the area, and by the mid-19th century Royton had emerged as <b>a</b> <b>mill</b> town. At its zenith, there were 40cotton mills—some of the largest in the United Kingdom—employing 80% of the local population. Imports of foreign cotton goods began the decline in Royton's textile industry during the mid-20th century, and its last mill closed in 1998.|$|E

Outlying public houses include the Royal Oak at Cowlishaw, and the Park Inn at Buckstones Road.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>mill</b> {{was built}} on Welhay stream but this was {{replaced}} by tidal mills. In the 17th century the City of Bristol bought the manors of North Weston and Portishead {{for access to the}} channel and as a place to stay outside of the city and, in the 19th century, as a seaside resort. An outer sea wall was built allowing the local marshes to be drained and increased the land available for farming. The dominant architecture is early Victorian, with some buildings maintaining their original features. The expansion in residential property coincided with the construction of the dock, pier and the rail link to Bristol. The Royal Hotel by the pier was built in a Tudor Gothic style in 1830, to provide accommodation and catering for travellers on the steamers from Bristol, Wales and Ireland.|$|E
50|$|Bower's Mill {{was built}} in the 18th century as <b>a</b> water-powered fulling <b>mill.</b> it has also been used as <b>a</b> corn <b>mill,</b> <b>a</b> worsted <b>mill</b> and <b>a</b> woolen <b>mill.</b> Textiles {{manufacturer}} J. & S.

5|$|After Crowhurst Bridge, {{which carries}} the Burwash to Stonegate road over the river, the railway {{crosses to the}} south bank. By Etchingham railway station, the River Limden joins from the north, the A265 road crosses, and the River Dudwell joins from the southwest. Both the railway and the river turn to the south to reach Robertsbridge. Another tributary, which flows to the {{northwest}} from near a gypsum mine at Brightling, turns {{to the south and}} runs parallel to the Rother before joining it in Robertsbridge. There is a network of channels, as the River Darwell joins the river, and there was formerly <b>a</b> <b>mill</b> nearby. The mill was called Hodson's Mill, and was part of Mill Farm. It burnt down in 1902, and the Georgian farmhouse was subsequently demolished. The only original farm building still standing is part of an oasthouse, dating from the late eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Peel {{was very}} popular and admirers often entertained him socially; he became {{well known for}} liking alcohol. On {{the morning of the}} match that England won after {{following}} on, Peel was intoxicated and had to be sobered up. In 1897, he was suspended by Yorkshire for drunkenness during a match. Although it is unclear what exactly happened—Peel said he slipped when fielding, but Hirst later recalled that he came on the field drunk and when asked to leave, bowled a ball in the wrong direction—he never played for the county again. Decades later, a widely circulated story suggested that Peel urinated on the pitch before being sent away. Historians consider the story unlikely, and attribute it to a misunderstanding by its reporter. Peel continued to play and coach cricket {{for most of his life}} and in later years became associated with Yorkshire once again. Among his other jobs, he became the landlord of a public house and worked in <b>a</b> <b>mill.</b> He died in 1941 at the age of 84.|$|E
5|$|By the Elizabeth period, Dunham Massey Castle {{had been}} demolished. Probably during the medieval period, Dunham Massey Hall became {{the home of}} the manorial lord, and a centre of power in the area. The hall was rebuilt in 1616, leaving no remains of the old medieval manor house. <b>A</b> <b>mill</b> at Dunham was {{documented}} in 1353, although the its present structure dates to the 1860s. It lies on the River Bollin, opposite Little Bollington. The first record of Dunham's deer park was also in 1353. The settlement at Dunham Woodhouse (named after an outlying lodge on the estate) dates from the 15th century. During the medieval period, the primary source of employment was agriculture, mainly arable farming.|$|E
