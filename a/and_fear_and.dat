25|$|Low reward {{dependence}} is then {{hypothesized to}} fit the psychological profile of Type 2 Alcoholism (predominantly in males). Type 2 Alcoholism is clinically characterized by an early onset of alcohol-related problems {{before the age of}} 25 (independent of external circumstances), drinking often associated with antisocial behavior, spontaneous alcohol-seeking behavior (inability to abstain), low associated guilt <b>and</b> <b>fear,</b> <b>and</b> frequent fighting and arrests after drinking. This combination of traits also describes people with Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) and is consistent with findings that type 2 alcoholics frequently suffer from ASPD. Since the inception of these theories they have been tested in several investigations and the results have been consistent with the theories.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{believed}} that Aristotle's Poetics comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry. The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity <b>and</b> <b>fear,</b> <b>and</b> is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes Poetics with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, an ex-foster {{child was}} awarded $30 million by jury trial in California (Santa Clara County) for sexual abuse damages that {{happened}} to him in his foster home from 1995 to 1999. The foster parent, John Jackson, was licensed by the state, {{despite the fact that}} he abused his own wife and son, overdosed on drugs and was arrested for drunken driving. In 2006, Jackson was convicted in Santa Clara County of nine counts of lewd or lascivious acts on a child by force, violence, duress, menace <b>and</b> <b>fear,</b> <b>and</b> seven counts of lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14, according to the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office. The sex acts that he forced the children in his foster care to perform sent him to prison for 220 years. Later in 2010, Giarretto Institute, the private foster family agency responsible for licensing and monitoring Jackson's foster home and others, was also found to be negligent and liable for 75 percent of the abuse that was inflicted on the victim, and Jackson himself was liable for the rest.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, a French poet at Mary's court, Pierre de Boscosel de Chastelard, was {{apparently}} besotted by Mary. In early 1563, he was discovered during a security search hidden underneath her bed, apparently planning to surprise {{her when she}} was alone and declare his love for her. Mary was horrified and banished him from Scotland. He ignored the edict, and two days later he forced his way into her chamber as she was about to disrobe.

500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the segment Bender stated, [...] "The big climactic cave sequence was hugely complex, and although it's very scary that this really terrifying thing is happening to our characters, {{at the end of the}} day I think the emotion from what we are experiencing is hopefully going to be the shock that people will stay with," [...] referring to Hodor's implied death. In an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor), he described filming the scene, [...] "It was a really heavy day — you’ve got these 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door — there were like eight people pushing from the other side and I was really holding them back. It’s definitely Method acting. It was a very intense day but one of the nice things was they let Isaac wrap me. He got to come over and say [...] "Mr. Nairn, that’s a wrap." [...] It was very emotional. It’s always been a little group of us together and it felt like our little group was breaking up." [...] Ellie Kendrick (Meera Reed) spoke about the filming of her part of the sequence, saying [...] "A lot of what's happening in that scene, in Meera's head, comes down to adrenaline. There's just no way she can stop and consider logically what's happening. If you have an army of the undead chasing after you, you're only going to be thinking one thing: [...] "Run!" [...] It was interesting, having the challenge of creating that adrenaline <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> sadness of Hodor, but not being able to process it at all. Having to recreate that feeling of immediacy, in a stuffy studio at 4 p.m. on a Thursday when you've been filming the same scene for a couple of days, it was difficult. But it was an exciting challenge, to constantly inject the energy those characters must be feeling in that moment." ...|$|E
500|$|The adult {{interest}} in the show is {{comparable to that of}} The Magic Roundabout, Tiny Toon Adventures, Rocko's Modern Life, Animaniacs, Dexters Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, SpongeBob SquarePants, Yo Gabba Gabba!, and Phineas and Ferb: older audiences appreciate jokes aimed at adult viewers and a sense of nostalgia for older cartoons and animated films. Many of the aforementioned shows had attracted college-aged fans who, when Friendship Is Magic was airing, would be raising children of their own. The show references works that older viewers would recognize, such as I Love Lucy, The Benny Hill Show, X-Men, , Diamond Dogs, The Big Lebowski, The Avengers, Star Wars, <b>and</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>and</b> Loathing in Las Vegas. Most of these fans are surprised by their fondness for the show. Shaun Scotellaro, operator of Equestria Daily, one of the main fan websites for the show, said, [...] "Honestly, if someone were to have told me I'd be writing a pony blog seven months ago, I would have called them insane." [...] He commented that the spread among adults was accelerated by its presence in online gaming. Mike Fahey, an editor for the gaming website Kotaku, noted that the fandom was [...] "building friendships among a diverse group of people that otherwise might have just sat {{on either side of the}} Internet, flinging insults at each other". Dr. Patrick Edwards, who performed several [...] "Brony Studies" [...] to survey and analyze the fandom, observed that the brony fandom is unlike most other fandoms which [...] "aren't welcoming to people who are different", and promote the show's message of love and tolerance. [...] Further interest came from the furry community, which includes a large number of animation fans. One contributor to [...] "The Brony Study" [...] (below), Dr. Marsha Redden said that the adult fans are [...] "a reaction to the US having been engrossed in terrorism for past ten years" [...] in a manner similar to the Cold War, and are [...] "tired of being afraid, tired of angst and animosity"; the show and its fandom are outlets from those strifes. She compared the brony fandom to that of the bohemian and beatniks after World War II and of the hippies after the Vietnam War. In a similar vein, Amy Keating Rogers, one of the show's writers, believes that the fans have come to like Friendship Is Magic due to [...] "so much cynicism and negativity out there in so many [...] shows", while the show [...] "has such a positive message" [...] that counters this.|$|E
