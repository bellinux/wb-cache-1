40|$|We have {{assessed}} {{the feasibility of}} retrograde nasotracheal intubation using a flexometallic tracheal tube with a detachable pilot balloon and connector {{in a study of}} 20 consecutive adult patients undergoing oropharyngeal surgery. The technique consisted of: (1) laryngostope-guided orotracheal intubation; (2) insertion of an 18 -gauge Foley catheter through the nose and retraction into the mouth; (3) detachment of the <b>anaesthesia</b> <b>circuit,</b> pilot balloon and connector; (4) insertion of the Foley catheter tip into the proximal end of the tracheal tube and inflation of the Foley catheter cuff; (5) withdrawal of the Foley catheter and attached tracheal tube back through the nose; (6) deflation of the Foley catheter cuff; and (7) reattachment of the pilot balloon, connector and <b>anaesthesia</b> <b>circuit.</b> The technique was successful at the first attempt in all patients. Mean time taken to insert the Foley catheter and retract it into the mouth was 19 (range 12 - 30) s. Mean time taken from disconnection to reconnection of the <b>anaesthesia</b> <b>circuit</b> was 8 (6 - 10) s. Heart rate increased after intubation, but there were no significant changes in arterial pressure. Nasal bleeding, airway problems and hypoxic events did not occur. No anatomical abnormalities or nasal trauma were detected at rhinoscopy. We conclude that retrograde nasotracheal intubation is feasible using a flexometallic tracheal tube with a detachable pilot balloon and connector...|$|E
40|$|Background. Large {{quantities}} of water condensation {{occur in the}} <b>anaesthesia</b> <b>circuit</b> during low-flow anaesthesia. We hypothesized that cooling of the CO 2 absorbent would prevent water condensation. Methods. To cool CO 2 absorbent efficiently, we constructed a novel temperature gradient reduction (TGR) canister, which was cooled by a blower. Experiments were divided into three groups: the conventional canister group (control group, n 6), the TGR canister without cooling group (TGR group, n 6), and the TGR canister with cooling group (TGR cooling group, n 6). One kilogramme of CO 2 absorbent was placed into the canister. The anaesthetic ventilator was connected to a 3 litre bag and 300 ml min 21 of CO 2 was introduced. About 500 ml min 21 of oxygen was used as fresh gas. The anaesthetic ventilator was set at a ventilatory frequency of 12 bpm, and tidal volume was adjusted to 700 ml. Results. The longevity of the CO 2 absorbent was 437 (SD 7. 8) min in the control group, 564 (13. 8) min in the TGR group (P, 0. 001 vs control), and 501 (5. 8) min in the TGR cooling group (P, 0. 001 vs control, TGR). Total water condensation in the <b>anaesthesia</b> <b>circuit</b> was 215 (9. 4) mg min 21 in the control group, 223 (9. 7) mg min 21 in the TGR group, and 47. 7 (5. 7) mg min 21 in the TGR cooling group (P, 0. 001 vs control, TGR). Conclusions. TGR of CO 2 absorbent with cooling is a useful and simple method to reduce water condensation in the <b>anaesthesia</b> <b>circuit</b> in low-flow anaesthesia, with a little increase in the longevity of the CO 2 absorbent...|$|E
40|$|In the {{presence}} of single-use airway filters, we quantified anaesthetic circuit aerobic microbial contamination rates when changed every 24 h, 48 h and 7 days. Microbiological samples {{were taken from the}} interior of 305 anaesthetic breathing circuits over a 15 -month period (3197 operations). There {{was no significant difference in}} the proportion of contaminated circuits when changed every 24 h (57 / 105 (54 %, 95 % CI 45 – 64 %)) compared with 48 h (43 / 100 (43 %, 95 % CI 33 – 53 %, p = 0. 12)) and up to 7 days (46 / 100 (46 %, 95 % CI 36 – 56 %, p = 0. 26)). Median bacterial counts were not increased at 48 h or 7 days provided circuits were routinely emptied of condensate. Annual savings for one hospital (six operating theatres) were $AU 5219 (£ 3079, € 3654, $US 4846) and a 57 % decrease in <b>anaesthesia</b> <b>circuit</b> steriliser loads associated with a yearly saving of 2760 kWh of electricity and 48 000 l of water. Our findings suggest that extended circuit use from 24 h up to 7 days does not significantly increase bacterial contamination, and is associated with labour, energy, water and financial savings...|$|E

40|$|Measurements {{of oxygen}} uptake (Vo 2) {{were carried out}} in infants with {{congenital}} heart disease using a circuit devised for use during the nitrous oxide/oxygen, controlled ventilation sequence of general anaesthesia. A highly significant correlation was found between Vo, and body weight which {{may be useful in}} situations where Va, is not easily measured. Oxygen uptake has been measured in congenital heart disease in sedated infants breathing spon-taneously via an open circuit (Cayler, Rudolph and Nadas, 1963; Lees, Way and Ross, 1967), and in awake infants by closed circuit (Levison, Delivoria-Papodopoulos and Swyer, 1965). Neither method is suitable during general <b>anaesthesia,</b> the open <b>circuit</b> destroys the char-acteristics of the T-piece circuit, and the closed circuit spirometric method cannot be used in th...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{square root}} of time (SqRT) model {{had been used}} to predict the uptake of {{volatile}} agents. Methods: We studied the rate of uptake of isoflurane in 10 patients using liquid isoflurane infusion through syringe pump into the closed circuit. The infusion rates were titrated to maintain a constant end tidal concentration of isoflurane of 1. 5 %. The predicted uptake values were also calculated from the square root principle and compared with the derived uptake. Results: The observed rate of uptake was higher than predicted from the Lowe and Ernst equation (P< 0. 001). There exists considerable inter-individual variability in uptake pharmacokinetics and it showed statistically significant correlation with ideal body weight, body weight (P< 0. 01), body surface area, and body weight 3 / 4 from 30 min of start of isoflurane infusion (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: SqRT model is inaccurate in predicting isoflurane uptake and underestimates it during closed <b>circuit</b> <b>anaesthesia...</b>|$|R
40|$|Anaesthesia {{systems that}} {{minimize}} {{the use of}} volatile anaesthetics to reduce cost and pollution are of interest. Closed <b>circuit</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> is the ideal solution, but requires continuous adjustment of fresh gas flow and composition and thus is demanding in routine practice. We describe an alternative system, the Reflector system, which is open in regard to oxygen, nitrogen and N 2 O, and semiclosed in regard to volatile anaesthetics. The Reflector system is a circle system with a carbon dioxide absorber and an automatic vapour delivery device placed in the inspiratory limb of the circle. A zeolite filter, the Reflector, is placed between the ventilator and the circle. The Reflector functions as a molecular sieve, preventing the volatile anaesthetic from leaving the circle. Isoflurane consumption using the Reflector system in bench tests and an animal study was {{compared with that of}} an open system. In bench tests consumption was reduced by 79 % and 82 %, at a respiratory frequency of 10 and 20 min- 1, respectively. The corresponding mean figures from the animal experiment were 65 % and 77 %...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac {{surgery is}} known to {{initiate}} a complex physiological response with the immune system activation (SIRS), neurohormonal response, metabolic changes, coagulopathies etc. SIRS is triggered by tissue injury, myocardial ischemia, reperfusion, use of <b>anaesthesia,</b> cardioplegia, extracorporeal <b>circuit</b> etc. Excessive immune system activation is associated with progression of SIRS, life-threatening multi-organ dysfunction (MOD), and increased morbidity/mortality in the postoperative period. The immune system response is regulated and terminated by both cellular and humoral regulatory and inhibitory mechanisms including changes in expression of in our study monitored molecules: CD 200 /CD 200 R, sCD 200 R and CD 95 /CD 95 L. Methods: The study included the measurement the expression of CD 95, CD 95 L, CD 200 R, and sCD 200 R molecules in granulocyte and monocyte populations in blood samples of 30 patients who underwent heart surgery using CPB. Samples collected before surgery, after surgery, and in the postoperative period (1 st, 3 rd, 7 th day) were analysed by flow cytometry and sCD 200 R by ELISA. Results: We discovered {{a significant increase in}} the percentage of granulocytes expressing inhibitory molecule CD 200 R (from 5 % to 17. 8 %) instantly after surgery. It might be presumed that these cells are less susceptible to [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{versatile}} {{closed circuit}} with new features is described. It {{may be used}} in a totally closed manner, without continuous gas inflow. As gas is absorbed from the circuit, it is replaced through a demand valve. Facilities for continuous gas mput and use of a ventilator are included, and one control converts it to a non-rebreathing circuit. The circuit has excellent mechanical characteristics in all modes, and has been used extensively in routine riiniral practice. The use of closed <b>circuit</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> is frequently suggested as a method of reducing atmospheric pollution by anaesthetic gases. In practice, however, truly closed circuits are very rarely used. Normally a flow of fresh gas is fed into a circle system with carbon dioxide absorption. This gas flow invariably exceeds patient requirements and the excess gas is spilled from the circuit. A totally closed circuit was described by Bushman and others (1977) in which the fresh gas requirement was obtained by use of a demand valve activated by sub-atmospheric pressure in a circle system after gas absorption from the circuit. One circuit configura-tion which utilized this principle used a self-inflating Oxford bellows in order that manual venti-lation, as well as spontaneous ventilation could be undertaken. However, the mechanical characteris-tics of this circuit proved unsatisfactory. The work required for spontaneous ventilation when the cir-cuit was used by conscious volunteers was too great to be tolerated {{for more than a few}} minutes. Consequently a new circuit was designed, the characteristics of which are described here. Fresh gas flow is obtained by delivering mixtures of nitr-ous oxide and oxygen on demand during spontane...|$|R
