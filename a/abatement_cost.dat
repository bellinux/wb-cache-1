40|$|The optimal {{pollution}} permit trading system is examined when the regulator, faced with incomplete information on firms' <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> and delivery coefficients, seeks to minimize expected total <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> {{to meet an}} ex ante pollution target. Intuitively, {{we find that the}} optimal trading ratio and permit cap are set such that there will be more pollution when <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> are high and less pollution when <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> are low. Surprisingly however, even when the delivery coefficients are known with certainty, the optimal trading ratio will not necessarily equal the delivery coefficient, nor will it be optimal for the total permit quantity to equal the given pollution target. Instead, the trading ratio will tend to be larger when there is negative correlation between firms' <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> and/or there is positive correlation between <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> and the delivery coefficient. The result that the optimal permit trading system under these circumstances depends on the regulator's information on firm's <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> contrasts sharply with a previously well-established attribute of permit trading systems: no information on firms' <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> is needed in order to design an optimal policy and achieve the least cost of reaching a pollution target (ex post). Our results demonstrate that whether an ex ante or ex post pollution target is used has fundamental implications for the design of the permit trading system. Finally, while not descriptive of all pollution problems, the class of pollutants for which this model applies is large. delivery coefficient, ex ante pollution target, ex post pollution target, permit trading, total permit cap, trading ratio, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the design of permit trading {{programs}} when {{the objective is to}} minimize the cost of achieving an ex ante pollution target, that is, one that is defined in expectation rather than an ex post deterministic value. We consider two potential sources of uncertainty, the presence of either of which can make our model appropriate: incomplete information on <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> and uncertain delivery coefficients. In such a setting, we find three distinct features that depart from the well-established results on permit trading: (1) the regulator’s information on firms’ <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> can matter; (2) the optimal permit cap is not necessarily equal to the ex ante pollution target; and (3) the optimal trading ratio is not necessarily equal to the delivery coefficient even when it is known with certainty. Intuitively, since the regulator is only required to meet a pollution target on average, she can set the trading ratio and total permit cap such that there will be more pollution when <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> are high and less pollution when <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> are low. Information on firms’ <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> is important in order for the regulator to induce the optimal alignment between pollution level and <b>abatement</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Does {{the impact}} of {{environmental}} regulation differ by plant vintage and technology? We answer this question using annual Census Bureau information on 116 pulp and paper mills' vintage, technology, productivity, and pollution <b>abatement</b> operating <b>costs</b> for 1979 - 1990. We find a significant negative relationship between pollution <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> and productivity levels. This is due almost entirely to integrated mills (those incorporating a pulping process), where a one standard deviation increase in <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> is predicted to reduce productivity by 5. 4 percent. Older plants appear to have lower productivity but are less sensitive to <b>abatement</b> <b>costs,</b> perhaps due to 'grandfathering' of regulations. Mills which undergo renovations are also less sensitive to <b>abatement</b> <b>costs,</b> although these vintage and renovation results are not generally significant. We find similar results using a log-linear version of a three input Cobb-Douglas production function in which we include our technology, vintage, and renovation variables. Sample calculations of {{the impact of}} pollution abatement on productivity show the importance of allowing for differences based on plant technology. In a model incorporating technology interactions we estimate that total pollution <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> reduce productivity levels by an average of 4. 7 percent across all the plants. The comparable estimate without technology interactions is 3. 3 percent, approximately 30 % lower. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Kyoto Protocol of 1997 {{attempts}} {{to address the}} problem of global warming by establishing national greenhouse gas emissions targets and timetables. To reduce emissions, the protocol outlines a tradeable pollution permit system. The system would allow countries with high <b>abatement</b> <b>costs</b> to purchase permits from countries with low <b>abatement</b> <b>costs,</b> equalizing global marginal <b>abatement</b> <b>costs.</b> The protocol, however, is destined to fail because of the free-rider problem and the problem of trade leakage.

40|$|Emissions trading schemes where {{allocations}} {{are based}} on updated baseline emissions give firms less incentive to reduce emissions for a given quota (or allowance) price. Nevertheless, according to Böhringer and Lange [On the design of optimal grandfathering schemes for emission allowances, Europ. Econ. Rev. 49 (2005) 2041 - 2055], such allocation schemes are cost-effective if the system is closed and allocation rules are identical across firms.

Moreover, if a price cap or banking/borrowing is introduced, the abatement profile {{is no longer the}} same as in the case with an auction (or lump-sum allocation). In addition, we show that with allocation based on updated emissions, the quota price will always exceed marginal <b>abatement</b> <b>costs,</b> possibly misguiding policy makers and investors about <b>abatement</b> <b>costs.</b> Numerical simulations indicate that the quota price most likely will be several times higher than marginal <b>abatement</b> <b>costs,</b> unless a significant share of allowances is auctioned. ...|$|R
