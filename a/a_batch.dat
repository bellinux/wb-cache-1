5|$|Production of the Heinkel {{continued}} {{after the}} war as the Spanish-built CASA 2.111. Spain received <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> of He 111H-16s in 1943 along with an agreement to licence-build Spanish versions. Its airframe was produced in Spain under licence by Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA. The design differed significantly in powerplant only, eventually being equipped with Rolls-Royce Merlin engines. The Heinkel's descendant continued in service until 1973.|$|E

5|$|As {{the road}} {{condition}} required extremely good driving skills, the China Relief Fund decided to test drivers {{and established a}} driving institute on a vacant piece of accessible land behind the Siong Lim Temple. Venerable Pu Liang, the monastery's 10th abbot, supported the China Relief Fund. Qualified volunteers from Nanyang converged in Singapore to form <b>a</b> <b>batch.</b> In 1939, about 3,200volunteers left in nine batches that included not only Chinese men, but also Indians, Malays, and four Chinese women. About 1,000 of them died in service, 1,000 settled in China and others returned to Nanyang after the war. The Venerable {{and two of his}} disciples were later arrested and executed during the Sook Ching Massacre in 1942.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1943, {{following}} {{the capture of}} southern Italy, Allied aircraft started to appear over the Balkans. NDH military command was aware of this danger {{and was trying to}} persuade the Germans to provide at least two squadrons of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters to the ZNDH. However, instead of Bf 109s, the only reinforcement fighters that came from Germany were the first of <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> of 36 overhauled captured French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters in October, plus another dozen which arrived in December. The Germans also supplied 25 Beneš-Mráz Beta-Minor sporting two seater monoplanes, which were dispatched between the squadrons for liaison duty, as the lack of radio communications equipment at squadron level was still evident.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Advances in {{broadband}} technology are generating an increasing demand for video-on-demand (VOD) applications. In this paper, an optimal video placement scheme is proposed for <b>a</b> <b>batching</b> VOD system with multiple servers. Given a specified re-quirement of the blocking probability, <b>an</b> optimal <b>batching</b> interval is derived {{and the corresponding}} file placement is obtained by hy-brid genetic algorithm. It is demonstrated that the specified re-quirement on blocking probability is satisfied, while both batching interval and server capacity usage are minimized simultaneously.

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the campaign, about 600 men from the regiment– including <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> of reinforcements that arrived in early October– carried out mainly defensive duties before leaving with the last Australian troops to be evacuated from the peninsula on 20 December. They did not take part in any large-scale battles, but were involved in fighting off a number of sharp attacks. The exact number of casualties suffered is not known, but 18 men from the regiment are known to have been killed in this time.|$|E

5|$|In August 1941, No. 450 Squadron {{personnel}} were separated from No. 260 Squadron, when the latter received its own ground crew. No. 450 Squadron moved to Rayak airfield, Lebanon, {{where it was}} allocated Hurricanes and Miles Magister trainers. <b>A</b> <b>batch</b> of 20 trainee Australian, British and Canadian pilots—the majority being Australian—were posted to the squadron in early October, and it began duties as an Operational Training Unit. A fortnight later these pilots were posted out and, lacking trained pilots, the squadron's aircraft were re-allocated. On 20 October, the squadron moved to Burg El Arab, Egypt, and began operating as an advanced repair, salvage and service unit, {{taking part in the}} North African Campaign.|$|E

Eventually, they both get onto a train and the police officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, the subway comes to a screeching halt, flashes of light are seen, and the train loses power. Later, when the train is back up and running, <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> of commuters enter the subway car and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his face and his left arm stripped down to the bone.|$|E
5|$|Nick Sheppard, {{formerly}} of the Bristol-based band the Cortinas, and Vince White were recruited as the Clash's new guitarists. Howard continued as the drummer. The reconstituted band played its first shows in January 1984 with <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> of new material and launched into the self-financed Out of Control Tour, travelling widely over the winter and into early summer. At a striking miners' benefit show ("Scargill's Christmas Party") in December 1984, they announced that a new album would be released early in the new year.|$|E
5|$|No. 37 (Transport) Squadron {{was formed}} on 15July 1943 at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, {{with a staff}} of two {{officers}} and thirteen airmen. Its inaugural commanding officer, Squadron Leader Neville Hemsworth (late of No.34 Squadron), arrived on 21July, and its first aircraft, a single-engined Northrop Delta (also formerly of No.34 Squadron), was delivered on 2August. The squadron was allocated the first of <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> of ten twin-engined Lockheed C-60 Lodestar transports on 23August. The Delta was written off following an accident on 30September. By then the squadron's staff numbered 190, including forty-five officers. It was declared operational on 11October 1943, undertaking regular courier flights across Australia to destinations including Perth, Western Australia; Darwin and Alice Springs, Northern Territory; Adelaide, South Australia; Maryborough, Queensland; and Launceston, Tasmania.|$|E

During this time, his left hand was in a plaster cast as a result of injuries sustained previously on the hockey field, but he insisted on being with his company in combat and was subsequently given permission to go.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts {{have adopted}} a range of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most use external fertilisation: the female lays <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> of eggs, the male fertilises them and the larvae develop without any further parental involvement. A fair proportion of teleosts are sequential hermaphrodites, starting life as females and transitioning to males at some stage, with a few species reversing this process. A small percentage of teleosts are viviparous and some provide parental care with typically the male fish guarding a nest and fanning the eggs to keep them well-oxygenated.|$|E
5|$|The care of {{offspring}} among amphibians {{has been}} little studied but, in general, the larger the number of eggs in <b>a</b> <b>batch,</b> the less {{likely it is that}} any degree of parental care takes place. Nevertheless, it is estimated that in up to 20% of amphibian species, one or both adults play some role in the care of the young. Those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young.|$|E

5|$|While a {{graduate}} student and member of TMRC, Dennis introduced his students to the TX-0 on loan to MIT indefinitely from Lincoln Laboratory. In the spring of 1959, McCarthy taught the first course in programming that MIT offered to freshmen. Outside classes, Kotok, David Gross, Peter Samson, Robert A. Saunders and Robert A. Wagner, all friends from TMRC, reserved time on the TX-0. They {{were able to use}} the TX-0 as a personal, single-user tool rather than <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> processing system, thanks to Dennis, faculty advisors and John McKenzie, the operations manager.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>batch</b> of 10 were {{produced}} and five were built from existing H-6s. The machines {{were joined by}} a center wing formed by two sections 6.15m (20ft) in length. The powerplants were five Junkers Jumo 211F engines producing 1,000kW (1,340hp) each. The total fuel capacity was 8,570L (2,260US gal). This was increased by adding of four 600L (160US gal) drop tanks. The He111Z could tow a Gotha Go 242 glider or Me 321 for up to 10 hours at cruising speed. It could also remain airborne if the three central powerplants failed. The He 111Z-2 and Z-3 were also planned as heavy bombers carrying 1,800kg (3,970lb) of bombs and having a range of 4,000km (2,500mi). The ETC installations allowed for a further four 600L (160US gal) drop tanks to be installed.|$|E
5|$|After VVKJ acceptance, a {{group of}} pilots {{conducted}} 16 mock dogfights between the IK-2 and the Hawker Fury I biplane already in service with the VVKJ, during which the IK-2 displayed overall superiority over the British-built aircraft. At one point, Bajdak declared his continuing doubts about the aircraft, and Dobnikar challenged him to a duel, with Bajdak flying his preferred aircraft, the Fury I. After Dobnikar won the climbing competition and a race to Zemun and back from Belgrade, the final dogfight forced Bajdak to concede that the IK-2 was the better aircraft. On 20 November 1937, the VVKJ submitted a proposal to order <b>a</b> <b>batch</b> of 12 IK-2s, which was approved the following month. The production version included some additional improvements, but continued testing resulted in further delays, with the aircraft not entering service for another year. By this time, international consensus had coalesced around {{the superiority of the}} low-wing monoplane, and the IK-2 was already obsolescent {{by the time it was}} delivered to VVKJ fighter units.|$|E
