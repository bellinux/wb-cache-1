40|$|<b>Activation</b> <b>domains</b> of promoter-specific {{transcription}} {{factors are}} critical entities involved in recruitment of multiple protein complexes to gene promoters. The <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> often retain functionality when transferred between very diverse eukaryotic phyla, yet the amino acid sequences of <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> do not bear any specific consensus or secondary structure. <b>Activation</b> <b>domains</b> {{function in the}} context of chromatin structure and are critical for chromatin remodeling, which is associated with transcription initiation. The mechanisms of direct and indirect recruitment of chromatin-remodeling and histone-modifying complexes, including mechanisms involving direct interactions between <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> and histones, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Transcription factor-induced DNA bending is {{essential}} for the assembly of active transcription complexes at many promoters. However, most eukaryotic transcription regulatory proteins have modular DNA-binding and <b>activation</b> <b>domains,</b> which appeared to exclude DNA bending as a mechanism of transcription activation by these proteins. We show that the transcription <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> of Fos and Jun induce DNA bending. In chimeric proteins, the transcription <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> induce DNA bending independent of the DNA-binding domains. DNA bending by the chimeric proteins is directed diametrically away from the transcription <b>activation</b> <b>domains.</b> Therefore, the opposite directions of DNA bending by Fos and Jun are caused, in part, by the opposite locations of the transcription <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> relative to the DNA-binding domains in these proteins. DNA bending is reduced in the presence of multivalent cations, indicating that electrostatic interactions contribute to DNA bending by Fos and Jun. Consequently, regions outside the minimal DNA-binding domain can influence DNA structure, and may thereby contribute to the architectural reorganization of the promoter region required for gene activation...|$|R

25|$|Plasmids are {{engineered}} {{to produce a}} protein product in which the DNA-binding domain (BD) fragment is fused onto a protein while another plasmid is {{engineered to}} produce a protein product in which the <b>activation</b> <b>domain</b> (AD) fragment is fused onto another protein. The protein fused to the BD may {{be referred to as}} the bait protein, and is typically a known protein the investigator is using to identify new binding partners. The protein fused to the AD may be referred to as the prey protein and can be either a single known protein or a library of known or unknown proteins. In this context, a library may consist of a collection of protein-encoding sequences that represent all the proteins expressed in a particular organism or tissue, or may be generated by synthesising random DNA sequences. Regardless of the source, they are subsequently incorporated into the protein-encoding sequence of a plasmid, which is then transfected into the cells chosen for the screening method. This technique, when using a library, assumes that each cell is transfected with no more than a single plasmid and that, therefore, each cell ultimately expresses no more than a single member from the protein library.|$|E

40|$|Efforts to {{increase}} the potency of transcriptional activators are generally unsuccessful because poor expression of activators in mammalian cells limits their delivery to target promoters. Here we report that the effectiveness of chimeric activators can be dramatically improved by expressing them as noncovalent tetrameric bundles. Bundled <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> are much more effective at activating a reporter gene than simple monomeric activators, presumably because, at similar expression levels, up to 4 times as many the <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> are delivered to the target promoter. These bundled <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> are also more effective than proteins in which <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> are tandemly reiterated in the same polypeptide chain, because such proteins are very poorly expressed and therefore not delivered effectively. These observations {{suggest that there is}} a threshold number of <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> that must be bound to a promoter for activation, above which promoter activity is simply a function of the number of activators bound. We show that bundling can be exploited practically to enhance the sensitivity of mammalian two-hybrid assays, enabling detection of weak interactions or those between poorly expressed proteins. Bundling also dramatically improves the performance of a small-molecule-regulated gene expression system when the expression level of regulatory protein is limiting, a situation that may be encountered in gene therapy applications...|$|R

40|$|The c-Fos protein {{has three}} {{activation}} modules at its C-terminus, {{two of which}} contain motifs (HOB 1 and HOB 2) which are also present in the <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> of c-Jun. Here we show the existence of two additional activation modules at the N-terminus of c-Fos, one of which contains a second HOB 1 motif (HOB 1 -N). The N-terminus also contains an inhibitor domain (ID 1) which silences HOB 1 activity. GAL 4 fusion experiments showed that ID 1 can specifically silence HOB 1 -containing <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> from c-Fos or c-Jun when linked in cis, but will not affect other distinct <b>activation</b> <b>domains.</b> The c-Fos related protein, FosB, also contains an inhibitor domain. Mutagenic and deletion analyses identify an inhibitor motif (IM 1) conserved between c-Fos and FosB, which is required for inhibitor function. Mutagenesis of IM 1 enhances the ability of c-Fos to activate an AP 1 bearing promoter. Finally, squelching experiments suggest that c-Fos ID 1 binds a limiting protein involved in inhibition. These results demonstrate {{the existence of a}} new class of inhibitor domain within transcriptional activators, which acts in a sequence specific manner to inhibit a subset of <b>activation</b> <b>domains...</b>|$|R

[...] Plants have developed a defense mechanism against type III effectors that includes R (resistance) genes triggered by these effectors. [...] Some of these R genes appear to have evolved to contain TAL-effector binding sites similar to site in the intended target gene. [...] This competition between pathogenic bacteria and the host plant has been hypothesized to account for the apparently malleable nature of the TAL effector DNA binding domain.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{there is}} no direct {{evidence}} of a SHH gradient, there is indirect evidence via the visualization of Patched (Ptc) gene expression, which encodes for the ligand binding domain of the SHH receptor throughout the ventral neural tube. In vitro studies show that incremental two- and threefold changes in SHH concentration give rise to motor neuron and different interneuronal subtypes as found in the ventral spinal cord. These incremental changes in vitro correspond to the distance of domains from the signaling tissue (notochord and floor plate) which subsequently differentiates into different neuronal subtypes as it occurs in vitro. Graded SHH signaling is suggested to be mediated through the Gli family of proteins which are vertebrate homologues of the Drosophila zinc-finger-containing transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci) [...] Ci is a crucial mediator of hedgehog (Hh) signaling in Drosophila. In vertebrates three different Gli proteins are present, viz. Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3, which are expressed in the neural tube. Mice mutant for Gli1 show normal spinal cord development, suggesting that it is dispensable for mediating SHH activity. However Gli2 mutant mice show abnormalities in the ventral spinal cord with severe defects in the floor plate and ventral-most interneurons (V3). Gli3 antagonizes SHH function in a dose dependent manner, promoting dorsal neuronal subtypes. SHH mutant phenotype can be rescued in SHH/Gli3 double mutant. Gli proteins have a C-terminal <b>activation</b> <b>domain</b> and an N-terminal repressive domain.|$|E
40|$|Activating stimuli for T {{lymphocytes}} {{are transmitted}} through plasma membrane domains that form at T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signalling foci. Here, we determined the molecular lipid composition of immunoisolated TCR <b>activation</b> <b>domains.</b> We observed that they accumulate cholesterol, sphingomyelin and saturated phosphatidylcholine species {{as compared with}} control plasma membrane fragments. This provides, for the first time, direct evidence that TCR <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> comprise a distinct molecular lipid composition reminiscent of liquid-ordered raft phases in model membranes. Interestingly, TCR <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> were also enriched in plasmenyl phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. Modulating the T-cell lipidome with polyunsaturated fatty acids impaired the plasma membrane condensation at TCR signalling foci and resulted in a perturbed molecular lipid composition. These results correlate the accumulation of specific molecular lipid species with the specific plasma membrane condensation at sites of TCR activation and with early TCR activation responses...|$|R
40|$|SummaryMisregulated {{transcription}} {{is linked}} to many human diseases, and thus artificial transcriptional activators are highly desirable as mechanistic tools and as replacements for their malfunctioning natural counterparts. We previously reported two artificial transcriptional <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> obtained from synthetic peptide libraries screened for binding to the yeast transcription protein Med 15 (Gal 11). Here we demonstrate that the transcriptional potency of the Med 15 ligands is increased through straightforward structural alterations. These artificial <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> upregulate transcription via specific Med 15 binding interactions and do not function in mammalian cells, which lack Med 15. This functional specificity stands in contrast to most natural or artificial <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> that function across all eukaryotic cell types. The {{results indicate that the}} screening strategy holds excellent promise for identifying peptide and small molecule transcriptional activators that function by unique mechanisms with advantageous specificity properties...|$|R
40|$|Several {{eukaryotic}} transcription {{factors such}} as Sp 1 or Oct 1 contain glutamine-rich domains that mediate transcriptional activation. In human cells, promoter-proximally bound glutamine-rich <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> activate transcription poorly {{in the absence of}} acidic type activators bound at distal enhancers, but synergistically stimulate transcription with these remote activators. Glutamine-rich <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> were previously reported to also function in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe but not in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that budding yeast lacks this pathway of transcriptional activation. The strong interaction of an Sp 1 glutamine-rich domain with the general transcription factor TAFII 110 (TAFII 130), and the absence of any obvious TAFII 110 homologue in the budding yeast genome, seemed to confirm this notion. We reinvestigated the phenomenon by reconstituting in the budding yeast an enhancer-promoter architecture that is prevalent in higher eukaryotes but less common in yeast. Under these conditions, we observed that glutamine-rich <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> derived from both mammalian and yeast transcription factors activated only poorly on their own but strongly synergized with acidic activators bound at the remote enhancer position. The level of activation by the glutamine-rich <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> of Sp 1 and Oct 1 in combination with a remote enhancer was similar in yeast and human cells. We also found that mutations in a glutamine-rich domain had similar phenotypes in budding yeast and human cells. Our results show that glutamine-rich <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> behave very similarly in yeast and mammals and that their activity in budding yeast does not depend on the presence of a TAFII 110 homologue...|$|R
50|$|Glis1 has an <b>activation</b> <b>domain</b> at its C-terminus and a repressive domain at its N-terminus.

40|$|We {{have used}} protein-blotting and protein {{affinity}} chromatography {{to demonstrate that}} each of the two glutamine-rich <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> of the human transcription factor Sp 1 can bind specifically and directly to the C-terminal evolutionarily conserved domain of the human TATA box-binding protein (TBP). These <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> of Sp 1 also bind directly to Drosophila TBP but bind much less strongly to TBP from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The abilities of the Sp 1 <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> to interact directly with the TBPs of various species correlate well with their abilities to activate transcription in extracts derived from the same species. We also show that a glutamine-rich transcriptional activating region of the Drosophila protein Antennapedia binds directly to TBP in a species-specific manner that reflects its ability to activate transcription in vivo. These results support the notion that TBP is a direct and important target of glutamine-rich transcriptional activators...|$|R
40|$|The {{transcription}} factor NFATp integrates multiple signal transduction pathways through coordinate binding with basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins and other {{transcription factor}}s. The NFATp monomer, {{even in the}} absence of its <b>activation</b> <b>domains,</b> recruits bZIP proteins to canonical NFAT–bZIP composite DNA elements. By contrast, the NFATp dimer and its bZIP partner bind noncooperatively to the NFAT–bZIP element of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene promoter. This observation raises the possibility that the function of the <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> of NFATp is dimer-specific. Here, we determine the consensus DNA binding site of the NFATp dimer, describe monomer- and dimer-specific NFATp–DNA contact patterns, and demonstrate that NFATp dimerization and dimer-specific activation subdomains are required for transcriptional activation from the TNF NFAT–bZIP element. We also show that these NFATp subdomains interact with the coactivator CBP (CREB-binding protein), which is required for NFATp-dependent TNF gene transcription. Thus, the context-specific function of the <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> of NFAT can be potentiated by DNA-directed dimerization...|$|R

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{evidence}} from viral systems has established that transcription factors play an important and direct role in activating viral DNA replication. Among the transcriptional <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> that can stimulate viral DNA replication are acidic domains such as those derived from herpes simplex virus VP 16 and the tumor suppressor p 53. Here we show that acidic <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> can also activate a cellular origin of replication in a chromosomal context. When tethered to the yeast ARS 1 (autonomously replicating sequence 1) origin of replication, both VP 16 and p 53 <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> can enhance origin function. In addition, the C-terminal acidic region of the yeast transcription factor ABF 1, which normally activates the ARS 1 origin, is sufficient for activating ARS 1 function when tethered to the origin. Mutations at residues Trp- 53 and Phe- 54 of a 20 -residue (41 to 60) activation region of p 53 abolish the activation of both replication and transcription, suggesting that the same structural determinants may be employed to activate both processes in yeast. Furthermore, using a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method, we demonstrate that the GAL 4 -p 53 chimeric activator can activate initiation of chromosomal replication from an origin inserted at the native ARS 1 locus. These findings strongly suggest functional conservation of the mechanisms used by the acidic <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> to activate viral DNA replication in mammalian cells and chromosomal replication in yeast...|$|R
40|$|Transcriptional {{activators}} {{can stimulate}} multiple {{steps in the}} transcription process. We have used GAL 4 fusion proteins to characterize the ability of different transcriptional <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> to stimulate transcriptional elongation on the hsp 70 gene in vitro. Stimulation of elongation apparently occurs via a mechanistic pathway {{different from that of}} stimulation of initiation: the herpes simplex virus VP 16, heat shock factor 1 (HSF 1) and amphipathic helix (AH) <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> all stimulate initiation, but only VP 16 and HSF 1 stimulate elongation; and mutations in hydrophobic residues of the HSF 1 <b>activation</b> <b>domains</b> impair stimulation of elongation but not of initiation, while mutations in adjacent acidic residues impair stimulation of initiation more than of elongation. Experiments in which activators were exchanged between initiation and elongation demonstrate that the elongation function of HSF 1 will stimulate RNA polymerase that has initiated and is transcriptionally engaged. Transcriptional activators thus appear to have at least two distinct functions that reside in the same domain, and that act at different times to stimulate initiation and elongation...|$|R
