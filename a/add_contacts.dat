40|$|Abstract—In an {{academic}} conference, {{it is difficult}} to find people that share similar research interests with you, and it is also a chore to add them into your personal online social network for later communication. Aiming at helping the conference attendees better organize their schedule and expand their social network, we designed and developed Find & Connect where we used location and encounters, together with the conference basic services, all through a web user interface, {{in order to get the}} homophily and physical interactions between users, and then to base these information for recommending new contacts to users. To demonstrate the usefulness of Find & Connect, we conducted a field trial at the UbiComp 2011 conference. Results show that users tended to consider historical physical encounter information to be the most important when they wanted to know someone or add other users as contacts, and that homophily works as a factor in users ’ decision to <b>add</b> <b>contacts.</b> Keywords- proximity, homophily, mobile social network, ephemeral social network, social linking, user behaviour I...|$|E

40|$|Several {{years ago}} I {{witnessed}} {{a graduate student}} speaking to person on his laptop screen. I asked, “who are you talking to?” He said to his wife in Turkey. I asked what software are you using? He said Skype, and it is free. Thus began my entry {{into the world of}} Skype. At first chance I downloaded Skype onto my personal computer. Since that time I have used Skype as a communication and instructional tool for academic purposes. Skype software allows communication (audio, video, and text) between and among various electronic devices (computers, mobile phones, smartphones, I pods, etc.) over the Internet. You can use it with or without headphones, microphones, and/or speakers (in the text or pure visual modes). After the free download to your personal computer (or “app” on an iPod for example) when prompted you create a personal name or “handle” and password, you then share your Skype Name as a contact with persons of your choosing. To establish a learning community you merely <b>add</b> <b>contacts</b> (or in my case) I ask them to add me to their contact list. When I receive their request, I give them a brief welcome and we begin our Skype communication and instructional relationship. Once you establish your contacts, you can also change your presence on Skype (how others view you electronically). For example if {{you do not want to}} be disturbed then “Do Not Disturb” is selected. A bright green icon indicates your “online” status and you are ready to go...|$|E

30|$|We {{will use}} a {{multilevel}} approach so that our findings draw attention to dependence and its economic consequences among policymakers, {{the media and the}} public. It is essential that how to address the growing numbers of older people with long-term needs for care becomes part of the broader debates around population ageing. Our communications plan includes strategies for engagement with national and international policy-makers, the media and the public, {{as well as with the}} scientific community. Our partnerships with ADI (Alzheimer’s Disease International) and HelpAge International are crucial in our aim of maximising the impact of our study findings: communications about study progress and findings will be disseminated via these organisations’ networks. Research teams in each country will establish a communications working group to oversee national communications, working closely with key stakeholders to develop plans to engage with journalists and media agencies. Oral testimonies, film and photography will be used to ensure that the voices and experiences of those most affected- older people, their families and communities are powerfully communicated. Through policy briefs and working papers, we will disseminate key project findings to specific groups of policymakers. Study findings will be published in high impact and specialist peer-reviewed journals. We will use the 10 / 66 website as a repository for all study documents (oral testimonies, films, protocols, policy-briefs, scientific publications etc.), so that these are easily and rapidly accessible to all. Email addresses are registered for downloads, allowing us to <b>add</b> <b>contacts</b> for future disseminations. Project updates will also appear in a regular newsletter (an established part of the 10 / 66 project).|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Influenza {{neuraminidase}} (NA) is {{an important}} target for antiviral inhibitors since its active site is highly conserved such that inhibitors can be cross-reactive against multiple types and subtypes of influenza. Here, we discuss the crystal structure of neuraminidase subtype N 9 complexed with a new benzoic acid based inhibitor (2) {{that was designed to}} <b>add</b> <b>contacts</b> by overpacking one side of the active site pocket. Inhibitor 2 uses benzoic acid to mimic the pyranose ring, a bis-(hydroxymethyl) -substituted 2 -pyrrolidinone ring in place of the N -acetyl group of the sialic acid, and a branched aliphatic structure to fill the sialic acid C 6 subsite. Results Inhibitor 2 { 4 -[2, 2 -bis(hydroxymethyl) - 5 -oxo-pyrrolidin- 1 -yl]- 3 -[(dipropylamino) methyl) ]benzoic acid} was soaked into crystals of neuraminidase of A/tern/Australia/G 70 c/ 75 (N 9), and the structure refined with 1. 55 [*]Å X-ray data. The benzene ring of the inhibitor tilted 8. 9 ° compared to the previous compound (1), and the number of contacts, including hydrogen bonds, increased. However, the IC 50 for compound 2 remained in the low micromolar range, likely because one propyl group was disordered. In this high-resolution structure of NA isolated from virus grown in chicken eggs, we found electron density for additional sugar units on the N-linked glycans compared to previous neuraminidase structures. In particular, seven mannoses and two N-acetylglucosamines are visible in the glycan attached to Asn 200. This long, branched high-mannose glycan makes significant contacts with the neighboring subunit. Conclusions We designed inhibitor 2 with an extended substituent at C 4 -corresponding to C 6 of sialic acid-to increase the contact surface in the C 6 -subsite and to force the benzene ring to tilt to maximize these interactions while retaining the interactions of the carboxylate and the pyrolidinone substituents. The crystal structure at 1. 55 [*]Å showed that we partially succeeded in that the ring in 2 is tilted relative to 1 and the number of contacts increased, but one hydrophobic branch makes no contacts, perhaps explaining why the IC 50 did not decrease. Future design efforts will include branches of unequal length so that both branches may be accommodated in the C 6 -subsite without conformational disorder. The high-mannose glycan attached to Asn 200 makes several inter-subunit contacts and appears to stabilize the tetramer. </p...|$|E
