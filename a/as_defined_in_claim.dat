The communication circuitry of the unmanned vehicle receives operational control signals from the portable control device and transmits operational parameter signals and visual signals to the portable control device. The movement control module controls the movement of the unmanned vehicle in response to movement control signals and generates a first portion of the operational parameter signals in response to operation of the movement control module. The surveillance vehicle controller is coupled to the communication circuitry. In addition, the surveillance vehicle controller is coupled to the movement control module and generates the movement control signals in response to a first portion of the operational control signals. The visual recording module records visual signals representative of one or more views from the unmanned vehicle in response to visual control signals and generates a second portion of the operational parameter signals in response to operation of the visual recording module. The unmanned vehicle controller is also coupled to the visual recording module and generates the visual control signals in response to a second portion of the operational control signals. The portable control device includes communication circuitry, a graphic user interface (GUI), and a portable control device controller. The communication circuitry of the portable control device receives the operational parameter signals and the visual signals from the unmanned vehicle and transmits the operational control signals. The GUI presents visual information to a user of the portable control device and receives user inputs thereby. The portable control device controller is coupled to the GUI and controls the operational mode of the portable control device. The portable control device controller monitors an operational environment of the portable control device and switches from a manual operation mode to a semi-automatic operation mode in response to a measured and weighted combination of detected inputs and monitored parameters within the operational environment of the portable control device, the controller providing GUI operational signals to the GUI for presenting a semi-automatic operation graphical user interface to the user while in the semi-automatic operation mode, the semi-automatic operation graphical user interface including a reduced set of user interfaces for the semi-automatic operation mode presented by the portable control device...|$|E

40|$|Canonical {{function}} coding at κ <b>as</b> <b>defined</b> <b>in</b> [2] was <b>claimed</b> <b>in</b> [2], Remark (a) {{after the}} proof of Theorem 39, to be<κ-directed closed. There is a minor gap in that argument {{and we want to}} take the opportunity here to provide a corrected and additionally simpler approach to that claim, i. e. present a short and self-contained improved version of Theorem 39 of [2]. Thus we provide a <κ-directed closed (in fact even <κ-linked closed), κ+-cc forcing to introduce a boldface definable wellorder of Hκ+, assuming κ is regular, κ<κ = κ and 2 κ = κ+. The main idea for the simplification (and in fact the whole proof) is essentially contained in [1]. This result slightly improves parts of a result in [3], where a ∆ 12 -definable wellorder of Hκ+ is introduced by <κ-closed (and in fact <κ-directed closed, but not <κ-linked closed), κ+-cc forcing (however without assuming 2 κ = κ+).
