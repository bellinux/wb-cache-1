It is also possible to have a unique pooling equilibrium where all borrowers choose either FRMs or ARMs. The model implies that an increase in the proportion of high risks will increase the likelihood of a separating equilibrium where both mortgage types are offered. Also, a uniform downward shift in the expected change in the interest rate or an increase in borrowers' current or future incomes make ARMs more attractive for both types of borrowers. # 2000 Academic Press 1...|$|R

Although numerous {{studies have focused on}} the assessment of the training e&# 64256;ect of plyometric training, studies focusing on elite players are missing. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of the study was to}} find out what changes in explosive {{strength of}} the lower extremities take place after a 6 week strength training with plyometric exercises and resistance exercises in elite basketball players. METHODS: Elite basketball players (n = 12; age 24. 71 &# 177; 1. 5 years; height 197. 0 &# 177; 7. 6 cm; weight 95. 8 &# 177; 8. 1 kg) performed during pre-season a 6 week training program with plyometric exercises and resistance exercises which were conducted biweekly during the pre-season. The changes in explosive strength were measured by the squat jump without arms, the counter movement jump without arms, the counter movement jump free arms and the 2 step run up jump. The players participated in two measurements. The 1 st (pretesting) was performed on the first day of pre-season and the 2 nd (posttesting) was completed two days after terminating the PT programme. The di&# 64256;erences between the average values of the monitored parameters were determined by the Wilcoxon paired test. To calculate the e&# 64256;ect size formula according to Fritz, Morris, and Richler (2012) : R = Z/&# 8730;N was used. RESULTS: Analysis of intra-group changes confirmed significant di&# 64256;erences between the two measurements in tests of vertical jump squat (Z = 2. 58, p =. 01, r =. 75), vertical jump from the point of the swing <b>arm</b> (<b>Z</b> = 2. 49, p =. 01, r =. 72) and vertical jump from place without the swing <b>arm</b> (<b>Z</b> = 2. 75, p =. 01, r =. 79). In case of the two step run up jump significant di&# 64256;erences were not found (Z = 1. 60, p =. 11, r =. 56). Analysis of intra-individual changes showed the significant interindividual di&# 64256;erences in the changes of the explosive power of the lower limbs after a 6 week training. The improvement in all tests was observed in nine of the twelve players, oppositelly the deterioration in one player. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study in elite basketball players have confirmed that the inclusion of plyometric exercises and exercises with additional resistance in the preparatory period may lead to significant changes in explosive power even elite senior basketball players...|$|R

Class 1 APRT +/- heterozygotes, such as CHO-AT 3 - 2, can be isolated at high spontaneous frequencies from wild-type CHO cell populations. Simon et al. [Simon, A. E., Taylor, M. W., Bradley, W. E. C. & Thompson, L. (1982) Mol. Cell.

This event appears to occur at {{only one of the}} two APRT alleles. To investigate the nature of this high-frequency event, and to determine the genetic basis for functional hemizygosity of the APRT locus in CHO-AT 3 - 2 cells, we have mapped the APRT locus by using CHO-AT 3 - 2 -mouse somatic cell hybrids. Our data confirm that CHO-AT 3 - 2 cells have a single functional APRT allele, which is located on the Z 7 chromosome. Karyotypic analysis of CHO-AT 3 - 2 revealed an interstitial deletion on the long <b>arm</b> of the <b>Z</b> 4 chromosome, in the very region where the other APRT allele should be located. To determine whether the Z 4 q interstitial deletion had resulted in physical loss of the APRT gene, DNA from CHO-AT 3 - 2 -mouse cell hybrids that had either lost or retained the Z 4 q- chromosome was analyzed for the presence of CHO APRT coding sequences.

Exercise interventions may be particularly appropriate for cancer survivors because they have the potential to improve physical and psychological functioning. The review aims to examine the effectiveness of exercise intervention on the quality of life (QOL) of breast cancer survivors. Five databases (Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, and CAJ Full-text Database) were searched from 2003 to July 2013. Clinical controlled trials of exercise interventions for breast cancer survivors who were at least 18 years old and had completed active cancer treatment were included. A total of 25 trials were included in this study, of which 19 were pooled together statistically. Subjects in the exercise interventions had higher overall QOL than subjects in the control group. The standardized mean difference (SMD) for changes in overall general QOL scores was 0. 70 (95 % CI 0. 21, 1. 19). The SMD for changes in cancer-specific QOL scores was 0. 38 (95 % CI 0. 03, 0. 74).

40|$|The male hypermethylated (MHM) region, {{located near}} {{the middle of the}} short <b>arm</b> of the <b>Z</b> {{chromosome}} of chickens, consists of approximately 210 tandem repeats of a BamHI 2. 2 -kb sequence unit. Cytosines of the CpG dinucleotides of this region are extensively methylated on the two Z chromosomes in the male but much less methylated on the single Z chromosome in the female. The state of methylation of the MHM region is established after fertilization by about the 1 -day embryonic stage. The MHM region is transcribed only in the female from the particular strand into heterogeneous, high molecular-mass, non-coding RNA, which is accumulated at the site of transcription, adjacent to the DMRT 1 locus, in the nucleus. The transcriptional silence of the MHM region in the male is most likely caused by the CpG methylation, since treatment of the male embryonic fibroblasts with 5 -azacytidine results in hypo-methylation and active transcription of this region. In ZZW triploid chickens, MHM regions are hypomethylated and transcribed on the two Z chromosomes, whereas MHM regions are hypermethylated and transcriptionally inactive on the three Z chromosomes in ZZZ triploid chickens, suggesting a possible role of the W chromosome {{on the state of the}} MHM region...|$|R

These two clones were demonstrated {{to be derived from}} the mRNA encoding an altered form of PKC inhibitor/interacting protein (PKCI), and its gene was named Wpkci. The Wpkci gene reiterated ∼ 40 times tandemly and located at the nonheterochromatic end of the chicken W chromosome. The W linkage and the moderate reiteration of Wpkci were conserved widely in Carinatae birds. The chicken PKCI gene, chPKCI, was shown to be a single-copy gene located near the centromere on the long <b>arm</b> of the <b>Z</b> chromosome. Deduced amino acid sequences of Wpkci and chPKCI showed ∼ 65 % identity. In the deduced sequence of Wpkci, the HIT motif, which is essential for PKCI function, was absent, but the α-helix region, which was conserved among the PKCI family, and a unique Leu- and Arg-rich region, were present. Transcripts from both Wpkci and chPKCI genes were present at significantly higher levels in 3 - to 6 -d (stages 20 – 29) embryos. These transcripts were detected in several embryonic tissues, including undifferentiated left and right gonads. When the green fluorescent protein–fused form of Wpkci was expressed in male chicken embryonic fibroblast, it was located almost exclusively in the nucleus. A model is presented suggesting that Wpkci may be involved in triggering the differentiation of ovary by interfering with PKCI function or by exhibiting its unique function in the nuclei of early female embryos...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Nowadays, mini screws {{are used}} in {{orthodontic}} tooth movement to obtain maximum or absolute anchorage. They have gained popularity among orthodontists for en masse retraction of anterior teeth after first premolar extraction in maximum anchorage cases. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the type of anterior tooth movement during the time when force was applied from different mini screw placements to the anterior power arm with various heights. Methods A finite element method was used for modeling maxillary teeth and bone structure. Brackets, wire, and hooks were also designed for modeling. Two appropriate positions for mini screw in the mesial and distal of the second premolar were designed as fixed nodes. Forces were applied from the mini screw to four different levels of anterior hook height: 0, 3, 6, and 9  mm. Initial tooth movement in eight different conditions was analyzed and calculated with ANSYS software. Results Rotation of anterior dentition was decreased with a longer anterior power arm and the mesial placement of the mini screw. Bodily movements occurred with the 9 -mm height of the power arm in both mini screw positions. Intrusion or extrusion of the anterior teeth segment depended on the level of the mini screw and the edge of the power <b>arm</b> on the <b>Z</b> axis. Conclusions According to the findings of this study, the best control in the sagittal plane during anterior en masse retraction was achieved by mesial placement of the mini screw and the 9 -mm height of the anterior power arm.

40|$|Ever since man domesticated {{the first}} wild animals several {{thousand}} years ago, many {{species have been}} living in close relationship with humans, being objects for our requests and wishes about any kind of phenotypic traits. As a result, we have by selective breeding created a fascinating spectrum of phenotypes within most species we have domesticated. The broad aim of this thesis has been to investigate the molecular mechanisms causing different colour and pattern phenotypes in domestic animals. In more detail, the mutation causing Greying with age and melanoma in horses and the mutations leading to the Sex-linked barring feather pattern in the domestic chicken have been studied. Grey horses are born any colour, but gradually loose their hair pigmentation and usually become white by the age of 6 - 8 years. The pigmentation loss only affects the hair, and the skin stays dark throughout life. Melanomas and vitiligo-like depigmentation frequently occur among Grey horses, and it is claimed that 70 - 80 % of Grey horses older than 15 years have melanocytic lesions. The Sex-linked barring pattern in chickens is characterized by black and white stripes on the feathers. Similar barring patterns are found among many bird species, such as the peregrine falcon and the zebra finch. The mutation causing Sex-linked barring has previously been mapped to the q <b>arm</b> of chromosome <b>Z,</b> which explains why the homogametic (ZZ) sex in chickens, males, develop a broader barring pattern. In this thesis, the mutations causing both traits are identified, and their functional properties are investigated. The mutation causing Greying with age and melanoma in horses was identified as a 4. 6 kb intronic duplication in the gene STX 17, not previously linked either to pigmentation or melanoma. Moreover, it could be shown that the mutation in STX 17 has an elevated copy number in melanoma DNA, and that it contains a strong melanocyte specific activating regulatory element residing a MITF binding site. This finding sheds further light on the intriguing molecular processes of melanoma development. The mutations linked to Sex-linked barring could be mapped to the CDKN 2 A/B tumour suppressor locus, a genetic region commonly associated with familiar forms of melanoma and also implied in the molecular mechanisms of pigmentation regulation...|$|R

African children {{may differ from}} other populations of children in developing countries because of differences in the prevalence of zinc deficiency, low birth weight and preterm delivery, recurrent or chronic infections such as HIV, or the quality of complementary diets and genetic polymorphisms affecting iron metabolism. The {{aim of this study}} was to ascertain whether adding zinc or multiple micronutrients to vitamin A supplementation improves longitudinal growth or reduces prevalence of anemia in children aged 6 - 24 months. Methods Randomized, controlled double-blinded trial of prophylactic micronutrient supplementation to children aged 6 - 24 months. Children in three cohorts - 32 HIV-infected children, 154 HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-infected mothers, and 187 uninfected children born to HIV-uninfected mothers - were separately randomly assigned to receive daily vitamin A (VA) [n = 124], vitamin A plus zinc (VAZ) [n = 123], or multiple micronutrients that included vitamin A and zinc (MM) [n = 126]. Results Among all children there were no significant differences between intervention <b>arms</b> in length-for-age <b>Z</b> scores (LAZ) changes over 18 months. Among stunted children (LAZ below - 2) [n = 62], those receiving MM had a 0. 7 Z-score improvement in LAZ versus declines of 0. 3 in VAZ and 0. 2 in VA (P = 0. 029 when comparing effects of treatment over time). In the 154 HIV-uninfected children, MM ameliorated the effect of repeated diarrhea on growth. Among those experiencing more than six episodes, those receiving MM had no decline in LAZ compared to 0. 5 and 0. 6 Z-score declines in children receiving VAZ and VA respectively (P = 0. 06 for treatment by time interaction). After 12 months, there was 24 % reduction in proportion of children with anemia (hemoglobin below 11 g/dL) in MM arm (P = 0. 001), 11 % in VAZ (P = 0. 131) and 18 % in VA (P = 0. 019). Although the within arm changes were significant; the between-group differences were not significant. Conclusions Daily multiple micronutrient supplementation combined with vitamin A was beneficial in improving growth among children with stunting, compared to vitamin A alone or to vitamin A plus zinc.

The intervention, fun ‘n healthy in Moreland!, used a Health Promoting Schools Framework and provided schools with evidence, school research data and part time support from a Community Development Worker to develop health promoting strategies. Comparison schools continued as normal. Participants were not blinded to intervention status. The primary outcome was change in adiposity. Repeated cross-sectional design with nested longitudinal subsample. Results Students from twenty-four primary schools (clusters) were randomised (aged 5 – 12  years at baseline). 1426 students from 12 intervention schools and 1539 students from 10 comparison schools consented to follow up measurements. Despite increased prevalence of healthy weight across all schools, after 3. 5  years of intervention there was {{no statistically significant difference}} between trial <b>arms</b> in BMI <b>z</b> score post-intervention (Mean (sd) : Intervention 0. 68 (1. 16); Comparison: 0. 72 (1. 12); Adjusted mean difference (AMD) : - 0. 05, CI: - 0. 19 to 0. 08, p =  0. 44). Children from intervention schools consumed more daily fruit serves (AMD: 0. 19, CI: 0. 00 to 0. 37, p =  0. 10), {{were more likely to have}} water (AOR: 1. 71, CI: 1. 05 to 2. 78, p =  0. 03) and vegetables (AOR: 1. 23, CI: 0. 99 to 1. 55, p =  0. 07), and less likely to have fruit juice/cordial (AOR: 0. 58, CI: 0. 36 to 0. 93, p =  0. 02) in school lunch compared to children in comparison schools. More intervention schools (8 / 11) had healthy eating and physical activity policies compared with comparison schools (2 / 9). Principals and schools highly valued the approach as a catalyst for broader positive school changes. The cost of the intervention per child was $ 65 per year. Conclusion The fun n healthy in Moreland! intervention did not result in statistically significant differences in BMI z score across trial arms but did result in greater policy implementation, increased parent engagement and resources, improved child self-rated health, increased fruit, vegetable and water consumption, and reduction in sweet drinks. A longer-term follow up evaluation may be needed to demonstrate whether these changes are sustainable and impact on childhood overweight and obesity.

Este estudo caracterizou-se por ser transversal e foram avaliados: peso, estatura, dobras cutâneas, diâmetros ósseos e circunferências; tipos e quantidade de atividades físicas; testes de performance: salto horizontal, shuttle run, sentar e alcançar, sentar e deitar; tipos de alimentos e ingestão energético protéica; renda domiciliar e escolaridade. Os procedimentos estatísticos foram freqüência e percentual, para os tipos de alimentos ingeridos e tipos de atividades realizadas e ANOVA e MANOVA com transformação em postos (ranks) para comparar as características antropométricas, testes de performance, quantidade de atividade física e ingestão energético-protéica em função do fator local. As crianças indígenas foram classificadas em dois grupos (- 2 escore z) de estatura para idade para realização dos procedimentos acima mencionados. Os resultados indicam que as crianças residentes nas zonas urbana e rural têm maior peso, estatura, diâmetros, circunferências e dobras cutâneas do que as residentes na Terra Indígena após serem controlados pela idade, quando controlados pela idade peso e estatura estas três últimas variáveis puderam explicar pouco as diferenças entre as crianças das três zonas, com exceção das meninas indígenas em que a área muscular do braço foi maior e a soma das dobras cutâneas foi menor quando comparadas com as demais meninas. Os resultados do escore z de peso, estatura e área gorda do braço foram maiores para as crianças das zonas urbana e rural, exceto na área muscular do braço para ambos os sexos. Os alimentos ingeridos pelas crianças da zona urbana e rural são mais diversificados e apresentam maior teor energético-protéico, contudo nas três regiões não atendem necessidades energéticas recomendadas. As atividades jogos e brincadeiras são variadas nas três regiões e as laborais realizadas em maior número na Terra Indígena, já iniciando o aprendizado daquelas atividades que farão na idade adulta. Nos testes de performance, quando controlados pela idade, peso e estatura as diferenças ocorrem apenas naqueles de flexibilidade, com melhores resultados para as crianças indígenas e no teste de sentar e deitar para os meninos das zonas urbana e rural. Existe uma tendência de maior quantidade de atividade física diária, medida pelo acelerômetro para as crianças indígenas. As possíveis influências dos fatores genéticos, associados ao estilo de vida podem ser fatores explicativos nas diferenças de crescimento encontradas nesta pesquisa. O contexto, com características rurais, em que as crianças vivem, parece estar influenciando os resultados dos testes de performance. Em se tratando de forma específica das crianças indígenas, verifica-se que aquelas com possível déficit de crescimento tendem a apresentar menores resultados nas características sócio-econômicas, de atividade física, de performance e ingestão nutricional, sendo apenas a ingestão energética estatisticamente significativa. As características do contexto sócio-cultural estudadas parecem ser menos favoráveis para as crianças com possível déficit de crescimento, contribuindo para um desenvolvimento menos favorável, quando comparadas com as demais crianças;;Abstract:The {{aim of this}} study is to investigate the growth, physical activity, performance and food intake in 277 children aged 8 and 9, residing in Indigenous land, in the rural and in the urban area of Nova Laranjeiras, the State ofParaná, Brazil. This was a cross-section study where weight; height; skinfold; bone diameter and circurnference; types and amount of physical exerci se; performance tests such as horizontal jump, shuttle run, sitting and reaching, and sitting and lying; types of food and protein energetic intake; income; and level of schooling were evaluated. The statistical procedures were frequency and percentage for the type of food eaten and the type of activity carried out. ANOVA and MANOVA, transformed into ranks to compare the anthropometrics characteristics, performance tests, amount of physical exercise, and protein and energy intake based on local factor function were used. The Native Indian children were classified into two groups « - 2 score z) and (> - 2 score z) height related to weight, canying out the procedures mentioned above. In terms of age factor, the results indicate that the children living in the rural and in the urban area are heavier, taller, have greater bone diameter and circumference and more skinfolds than those living on Indigenous lands. In terms of age, weight and height factors, these three variables could little explain the differences between the children from the three areas, except for the Native lndian girls whose arm muscle area was greater, and whose sum of the skin folds was less when compared to the girls from the other areas. The results of weight, height and <b>arm</b> fat area <b>z</b> score were greater for the children from the urban and rural areas, except for the arm muscle area for both sexes. The food intake of the children from urban and rural areas is more diversified and presents greater protein energetic proportion; however all three areas do not fulfill the recommended energetic necessities. The activities, games and entertainrnent are varied in the three areas with the work related ones being more carried out in the indigenous lands, where training in the activities the children will be canying out as adults, is already started. In the motor performance tests, in terms of age, weight and height, the differences only occur in the flexibility tests with the Native Indian children presenting better results and in the sitting and lying where the boys from both urban and rural areas present better results. The Native Indian children tend to do more daily physical activity, which is measured by the accelerometer. The possible influences of the genetic factors associated to life-style can be the explanation for factors such as the growth difference found in this research. The context with rural characteristics in which the children tive, seems to be influencing the results of the performance test. When dealing specifically with Native Indian children, it was verified that those with a possible growth deficit are inc 1 ined to present lower results in the following aspects: socio-economica 1 level, physical activity, performance, and nutritional intake, where on 1 y the energetic intake is statistically significant. The characteristics of the socio-cultural context studied seem to be less favorable for the children with a possible growth deficit, thus contributing to a less favorable development when compared to other childre...|$|R
