5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that the saga writers had <b>accurate</b> <b>information</b> on details of the battle beyond the sparse accounts in the surviving poems.

5|$|To convey <b>accurate</b> <b>information,</b> it {{soon became}} {{necessary}} to have a standard vocabulary describing clouds; this was achieved {{by means of a}} series of classifications first achieved by Luke Howard in 1802, and standardized in the International Cloud Atlas of 1896.|$|E

5|$|Beginning on August 4, 1941, {{they drew}} up {{the plan in}} {{accordance}} with strategic policies promulgated earlier that year, outlined in the ABC-1 agreement with the British Commonwealth, and Rainbow 5, the U.S. war plan. The group completed AWPD-1 in the allotted nine days and carefully rehearsed a presentation to the Army General Staff. Its forecast figures, despite planning errors from lack of <b>accurate</b> <b>information</b> about weather and the German economic commitment to the war, were within 2 percent of the units and 5.5 percent of the personnel ultimately mobilized, and it accurately predicted the time frame when the invasion of Europe by the Allies would take place.|$|E
5|$|Further {{neurological}} examinations {{are crucial}} in {{the differential diagnosis}} of AD and other diseases. Interviews with family members are also utilised {{in the assessment of}} the disease. Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, {{as well as on the}} decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate <b>accurate</b> <b>information</b> to a physician.|$|E
5|$|Most land in Saudi Arabia {{is owned}} by the {{government}} and only cultivated land and urban property are subject to individual ownership. All land titles must be registered, but there is no <b>accurate</b> <b>information</b> as to the extent of registration. Real estate could only be owned by Saudi citizens until 2000, when the property laws were amended to allow foreigners to own property in Saudi Arabia. Property investments by non-Saudis of more than 30 million Saudi riyals require approval of the Council of Ministers and foreigners remain prohibited from owning property in Medina and Mecca.|$|E

5|$|Territorial {{males are}} very site-faithful; 90% {{return to the}} same lekking sites in {{subsequent}} seasons, the most dominant males being {{the most likely to}} reappear. Site-faithful males can acquire <b>accurate</b> <b>information</b> about the competitive abilities of other males, leading to well-developed dominance relationships. Such stable relationships reduce conflict and the risk of injury, and the consequent lower levels of male aggression are less likely to scare off females. Lower-ranked territorial males also benefit from site fidelity since they can remain on the leks while waiting for the top males eventually to drop out.|$|E
5|$|For Alderson {{the battle}} {{had been a}} failure: {{although}} his troops had held, he had found himself {{out of touch with}} the front line and unable to get <b>accurate</b> <b>information</b> about the situation. At one stage he had been commanding 33 battalions across several miles of front line with no central co-ordination and great confusion between his distant headquarters and the trenches. In addition to his personal failings however, the Ross rifles had proven almost useless in battle and some of Alderson's officer corps had performed poorly. In particular Brigadier-General Richard Turner, commander of the 3rd Brigade, and Turner's brigade-major, Colonel Garnet Hughes, the son of Sam Hughes, caused much havoc when on the second day of the battle, they unilaterally withdrew the 3rd Brigade from the front line, opening up a 4,000-yard gap through which the Germans threatened the entire Ypres Salient. Colonel John Carson however, who reported personally to Hughes, downplayed the difficulties and blamed the heavy casualties on Alderson's leadership, indicating that the division had only been saved from annihilation by the actions of Turner and Hughes.|$|E
5|$|On 22 September Mack {{decided to}} hold the Iller line {{anchored}} on Ulm. In {{the last three days}} of September, the French began the furious marches that would place them at the Austrian rear. Mack believed that the French would not violate Prussian territory, but when he heard that Bernadotte's I Corps had marched through Prussian Ansbach, he made the critical decision to stay and defend Ulm rather than retreat to the south, which would have offered a reasonable opportunity at saving the bulk of his forces. Napoleon had little <b>accurate</b> <b>information</b> about Mack's intentions or maneuvers; he knew that Kienmayer's Corps was sent to Ingolstadt east of the French positions, but his agents greatly exaggerated its size. On 5 October Napoleon ordered Ney to join Lannes, Soult, and Murat in concentrating and crossing the Danube at Donauwörth. The French encirclement, however, was not deep enough to prevent Kienmayer's escape: the French corps did not all arrive at the same place– they instead deployed on a long west-east axis– and the early arrival of Soult and Davout at Donauwörth incited Kienmayer to exercise caution and evasion. Napoleon gradually became more convinced that the Austrians were massed at Ulm and ordered sizeable portions of the French army to concentrate around Donauwörth; on 6 October three French infantry and cavalry corps headed to Donauwörth to seal off Mack's escape route.|$|E

5|$|The Cuban iguana is {{naturally}} distributed in rocky coastal areas on Cuba and throughout {{as many as}} 4,000 islets surrounding the Cuban mainland, including Isla de la Juventud off the southern coast, which {{has one of the}} most robust populations. Relatively safe populations are found on some islets along the north and south coasts and in isolated protected areas on the mainland. These include Guanahacabibes Biosphere Reserve in the west, Desembarco del Granma National Park, Hatibonico Wildlife Refuge, Punta Negra-Quemados Ecological Reserve, and Delta del Cauto Wildlife Refuge, all in eastern Cuba. Because of this wide distribution, <b>accurate</b> <b>information</b> about the number of distinct subpopulations of Cuban iguanas cannot be determined. The population on the US Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay has been estimated at 2,000 to 3,000 individuals, and the animals are treated well and protected by US forces stationed at the base. An unusual incident occurred when a detainee in the prison assaulted a guard with a bloody tail torn from a Cuban iguana in May 2005.|$|E
5|$|Throughout March and April, allied {{intelligence}} was baffled by {{the movements of}} the units belonging to the North Vietnamese 2nd Division, and that was reflected in the information obtained by U.S. military forces. For example, the U.S. 1st Marine Division reported that the enemy's 2nd Division Headquarters, the 3rd Regiment, the 21st Regiment, and the VC's 1st Regiment were within the vicinity of Khâm Đức, Thượng Đức, and Hội An, respectively. In contrast, information released by the U.S. 27th Marines Regiment showed the presence of the 3rd and 21st Regiments near Goi Noi Island, whereas the 2nd Division Headquarters was reported to be in the Que Son Valley. Despite the lack of <b>accurate</b> <b>information,</b> allied intelligence generally agreed the North Vietnamese might begin attacking isolated outposts and units as their next course of action. Subsequently, on 4 May 1968, the Americal Division made amendments to their Golden Valley Plan, the plan for the relief and reinforcements of CIDG camps, to enable the deployment of the 1st Battalion, 46th Infantry Regiment, 196th Light Infantry Brigade to support Khâm Đức.|$|E
