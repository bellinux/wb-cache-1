5|$|On Saturday February 24, 2007 {{at about}} 6:55a.m., Brown's Chevrolet Equinox {{was stolen from}} an on-street parking {{location}} by someone with key access and crashed into three parked vehicles before being abandoned <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> family home. Brown had driven his son {{to play in a}} basketball tournament in Jamestown, New York on Friday February 23. They returned home at approximately 10:30p.m. from the tournament. In interviews at the end of March 2007, Brown claimed that all members of his family with known key access had alibis. At the time Brown III possessed a learner's permit. Canisius College security cameras recorded parts of the accident, including the driver leaving the scene of multiple accidents. In April a second video recording with more fluid movement was revealed in contrast to the original recording of 36 frames per minute. In a news conference Brown announced that Byron Brown III took the senior Brown's car without permission and drove about the area near his house and Canisius College campus. Brown III admitted to the damage and was charged with driving without a driver's license and leaving the scenes of multiple accidents. Brown III was scheduled to appear on April 16, 2007 in Buffalo City Court on the charges. He pleaded guilty to unlicensed driving and leaving the scene of an accident. In 2010, his son was charged with petit larceny for leaving a store with goods that were not paid for. Byron Jr. was spared a criminal conviction when a judge granted him a delayed dismissal on shoplifting charges, as recommended by prosecutors. Buffalo City Judge David M. Manz warned him and Xavier Jemison that they have to complete a four-hour shoplifting class and stay out of trouble for the next six months. He granted each an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal, meaning their petit larceny charges will be dismissed if they comply with his orders.|$|E
