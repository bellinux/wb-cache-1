The cost could be measured in different forms, e.g., to the query issuer, the cost could be a monetary incentive to a user providing an <b>answer</b> <b>about</b> a query (about a region). This means that a general mechanism to ask everyone could incur a high cost if everyone actually answers, as we discuss below.|$|R

500|$|Jordan {{felt that}} the key to a {{successful}} police drama was its ability to reflect the society [...] "in which it existed". <b>Answers</b> <b>about</b> what best reflected the society that people lived came from joint head of Kudos, Jane Featherstone, who stated that HolbyBlue would be the first British police drama to be created since the September 11 attacks.

[...] Metacritic gave the show a score of 54 out of 100, based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews". [...] TV Guides Matt Roush felt that the series could become a hit similar to Bones and Castle. [...] Other critics felt that the series had issues. [...] Zap2it.com's Sarah Huggins liked the concept for the series and Gruffudd's performance, but she felt that the first two episodes were inconsistent [...] "in tone and story". [...] Both Varietys Brian Lowery [...] and Adweeks Sam Thielman believed that Forever [...] could not last as it faced CBS's Person of Interest in the 10 p.m. timeslot and as Forevers lead-in, Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., had dropped in the ratings during its first season. [...] Lowery also believed {{that the lack of}} <b>answers</b> <b>about</b> Henry's immortality could not sustain the series. [...] The Hollywood Reporters Tim Goodman concurred, feeling that the lack of <b>answers</b> <b>about</b> Henry's immortality could pose problems for viewers. [...] Still others felt that the series was a derivative of other series. [...] Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com felt that the series was a derivative of Sherlock Holmes. [...] Although Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly felt that Forever was a derivative of other procedurals, she stated that the show was [...] "breezy and entertaining and reasonably clever, at least when its Sherlock Scanning isn't out of control" [...] due to the performances of Gruffudd, de la Garza, and Hirsch and due to Miller's conceptualization of the series.|$|E
