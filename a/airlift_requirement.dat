Since September 2001, these aircraft have delivered over 2. 4 million tons of cargo to staging and operating bases in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet determining the number and mix to meet current and future <b>airlift</b> <b>requirements</b> has become increasingly challenging given distinct {{differences between the two}} aircraft. While the C- 5 can carry more cargo, the newer C- 17 is more flexible since it can deliver to forward-deployed bases and has a higher mission capable rate. GAO was asked to identify the impact C- 5 modernization cost increases have had on the mix of aircraft; assess the current C- 5 modernization cost estimate; and identify C- 17 production plans and issues related to production line shutdown. To conduct its work, GAO reviewed options DOD considered to meet its current and future strategic <b>airlift</b> <b>requirements,</b> and evaluated C- 5 modernization and C- 17 production line shut down cost estimates. ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{change of}} mission in 1966 from Air Force Logistics Command to Military Airlift Command (MAC) meant that Norton {{became one of}} six Military Airlift Command strategic-airlift bases, {{supporting}} US Army and Marine Corps' <b>airlift</b> <b>requirements</b> among other functions. Also, a new MAC passenger terminal was built to replace the World War II era (1944) facility to better handle passenger traffic, primarily to and from Southeast Asia. The new airline-style building was activated in 1968. The base newspaper in this era was named [...] "The Globetrotter".|$|R
50|$|A study {{conducted}} by the European Air Group (EAG) in 2000 came to the conclusion, that it would be beneficial to co-ordinate the international military <b>airlift</b> <b>requirements</b> and the means to meet them between the EAG nations to exploit all possible synergies. It finally recommended to establish a permanent co-ordination element managing the airlift co-ordination needs of nations in an evolutionary approach by smoothly transferring competencies from existing national structures. This multinational management structure should be developed step by step from purely co-ordination to a combined entity with full command authority.|$|R

2500|$|There was {{debate over}} {{follow-on}} C-17 orders, Air Force having requested line shutdown while Congress attempted to reinstate production. In FY2007, the Air Force requested $1.6 billion {{in response to}} [...] "excessive combat use" [...] on the C-17 fleet. In 2008, USAF General Arthur Lichte, Commander of Air Mobility Command, indicated before a House of Representatives subcommittee on air and land forces a need to extend production to another 15 aircraft to increase the total to 205. Pending the delivery {{of the results of}} two studies in 2009, Lichte observed that the production line may remain open for further C-17s to satisfy <b>airlift</b> <b>requirements.</b> The USAF eventually decided to cap its C-17 fleet at 223 aircraft; its final delivery was on 12 September 2013.|$|R
50|$|It {{provided}} airlift to Southeast Asia {{during the}} Vietnam War {{and for other}} contingency operations, as well as numerous humanitarian missions. Beginning in 1978 the 914th supported the U.S. Southern Command by periodically fulfilling <b>airlift</b> <b>requirements</b> throughout Latin America. Between September 1990 and April 1991 the group deployed all aircraft and numerous aircrews and support personnel to Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, to provide airlift {{in support of the}} war in Southwest Asia, including a tactical resupply airdrop to troops of the XVIII Airborne Corps. A 314th crew provided the first medevac mission of the war. Other personnel deployed to Saudi Arabia and backfilled positions in the U.S. and Europe. Since the early 1990s the wing has frequently deployed personnel in support of contingency operations in Southwest Asia and the Balkans.|$|R
25|$|Germany led {{the recent}} effort to lease An-124s for NATO {{strategic}} <b>airlift</b> <b>requirements.</b> Two aircraft are leased from SALIS GmbH as a stopgap until the Airbus A400M is available.

In 1974 the unit was returned to Military Airlift Command (MAC) when TAC transferred out its troop carrier mission. In the early 1970s, USAF's [...] "Total Force" [...] policy brought the wing into full partnership with its Air Force counterparts by mandating co-operation and teamwork between Air Guard and active duty Air Force units in all phases of military airlift operations.

2500|$|By 1980, the USAF {{found itself}} with a large fleet of aging C-141 Starlifter cargo aircraft. Compounding matters, USAF needed {{increased}} strategic airlift capabilities to fulfill its rapid-deployment <b>airlift</b> <b>requirements.</b> The USAF set mission requirements and released a request for proposals (RFP) for C-X in October 1980. McDonnell Douglas elected {{to develop a new}} aircraft based on the YC-15, under Program Manager Joe Van Dyke. Boeing bid an enlarged three-engine version of its AMST YC-14. Lockheed submitted two designs, a C-5-based design and an enlarged C-141 design. On 28 August 1981, McDonnell Douglas was chosen to build its proposed aircraft, then designated C-17. Compared to the YC-15, the new aircraft differed in having swept wings, increased size, and more powerful engines.

50|$|MATS airdrop {{capabilities}} were greatly {{enhanced with}} the addition of the new C-141 Starlifter in late 1964. Two years later the Military Air Transport Service was redesignated the Military Airlift Command (MAC). By 1969 <b>airlift</b> <b>requirements</b> to Vietnam had declined to the level that allowed renewing an airdrop competition. Declining theater requirements coincided with the clear need for C-141 airdrop training. So, MAC held a Combat Airlift Competition from 12 - 20 July 1969 at Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina for C-141 wings. The 60th, 62d, 63d, 436th, 437th, and 438th Military Airlift Wings each sent two aircrews, one maintenance crew, and one C-141 to participate. The competition involved using CARP procedures delivering both personnel and equipment during both day and night flying utilizing drop zones at Fort Bragg, North Carolina and Strategic Air Commandâ€™s Radar Bomb Scoring Site at Richmond, Kentucky. For the first time the maintenance team received an evaluation and each team participated in an Engine Running Offload (ERO).|$|R

In 2013, five USAF C-17s supported French operations in Mali, operating with other nations' C-17s (RAF, NATO and RCAF deployed a single C-17 each).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a simulation model designed to estimate aircraft Mission Capable Rates (MCR) for the United States Air Force. This simulation model originated out of the need to estimate the MCR for different modernization schemes to be implemented on the Air Force C- 5 Galaxy aircraft. Assigned to the Air Mobility Command (AMC), the C- 5 is one of our nations only two strategic airlift aircraft that can carry large outsize cargo (e. g., helicopters and tanks). The other outsize capable strategic airlift aircraft is the C- 17 Globemaster III. At the same time, the C- 5 is one of the Air Forces least reliable aircraft. This means that AMC has a deficiency in meeting all of its wartime cargo airlift missions. To address this problem, AMC embarked on a year-long Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) study in 1999 to determine the best value solution for the Air Force to meet its cargo <b>airlift</b> <b>requirements.</b> Integral to this analysis is the aforementioned simulation model used to estimate C- 5 MCR.

2500|$|In October 1962, there began {{what became}} known as the Southeast Asia <b>Airlift</b> System. <b>Requirements</b> were {{forecast}} out to 25 days, and these requirements were matched against available resources. The 315th Troop Carrier Group and 8th Aerial Port Squadron came into being and set the stage for tighter control of airlift operations. [...] The era of the Mule Train operation was over. It left behind a record of success and a collection of procedures and techniques for cargo work in Southeast Asia.|$|R
50|$|Once {{this initial}} problem was solved, {{operations}} flowed smoothly. That is until the team realized {{they would have}} to transport more than the amount of passengers they were originally told. Original estimates put the <b>airlift</b> <b>requirements</b> at about 1,500 passengers. That number was almost half of what the actual passenger load really was. This had the potential of negating any effect the mission may have since, given the resources and time available, there was no way the operation could transport all of the stranded pilgrims before Saudi Arabia closed the gates to Mecca on 27 August. Goss immediately voiced his concern to his superiors and the US State Department made an impassioned plea to the Saudi government to keep the gates open for one extra day. Not only did the Saudi government heed the request, they went beyond it by keeping the gates open for two extra days.The last flight of the operation left Beirut at 0522 on 29 August 1952. When it completed its transit and landed in Jeddah, Operation Hajji Baba ended. During the four days of the operation, the C-54s had transported 3,763 passengers in the course of 75 round-trips covering over 117,000 miles. No aircraft or crew were lost during the operation.|$|R
