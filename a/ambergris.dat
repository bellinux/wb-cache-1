5|$|Five {{individuals}} died in maritime {{accidents involving}} {{at least one}} catamaran. There was an accident involving a bus carrying evacuees, killing four people on board. Three people died on the offshore <b>Ambergris</b> Caye. Overall, 19 people perished in the country. Several injuries, mainly from flying debris, were reported in San Pedro, and there were 142 people who were injured in the storm. Throughout the country, approximately 3,279 homes were either damaged or destroyed. The damage total from Keith was initially estimated at $200 million, about half of which to tourism facilities; the remainder was roughly split between crop and infrastructure damage. About 75% of the crops in the country were damaged, including much of the corn harvest that was expected to begin in October. The damage total was later estimated at $280 million, most {{of it on the}} offshore <b>Ambergris</b> Cay and Caye Caulker.|$|E
5|$|In 1944 the Seagram Company started {{manufacturing}} the Captain Morgan {{brand of}} rum, {{named after the}} privateer. In 2001 the Captain Morgan brand was sold to Diageo, the multinational drinks company based in London. The name of Morgan has been attached to local sites in the Caribbean, such as Morgan's Bridge, Morgan's Pass and Morgan's Valley in Clarendon, Morgan's Harbour Hotel and Beach Club in Kingston, the Hotel Henry Morgan, located in Roatán, Honduras, the Port Morgan resort located in Haiti and Captain Morgan's Retreat and Vacation Club on <b>Ambergris</b> Caye, Belize.|$|E
5|$|Spermaceti, {{obtained}} {{primarily from}} the spermaceti organ, and sperm oil, obtained {{primarily from the}} blubber in the body, were much sought after by eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth century whalers. These substances found a variety of commercial applications, such as candles, soap, cosmetics, machine oil, other specialised lubricants, lamp oil, pencils, crayons, leather waterproofing, rust-proofing materials and many pharmaceutical compounds. <b>Ambergris,</b> a solid, waxy, flammable substance produced in the digestive system of sperm whales, was also sought as a fixative in perfumery.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} warning was issued for the coastal locations north of Belize City with the forecast of 150mph (240km/h) winds. The government instituted a dusk-to-dawn curfew from Belize City to the Mexican border. On August 16and17, Prime Minister Said Musa chaired two meetings of Belize's National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO). He instructed {{the newly created}} Coastguard to evacuate popular tourist sites Caye Caulker and <b>Ambergris</b> Caye by boat and plane. Authorities also evacuated Belize City's three hospitals, moving high-risk patients inland to the capital Belmopan. The mayor urged residents to leave Belize City and {{to make use of}} shelters in the capital.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} in {{the northern}} offshore islands and {{in the northern}} portion of the mainland. On the offshore islands, downed trees and power lines blocked most roads. In Caye Caulker and San Pedro, Keith damaged the roofs of about 90% of houses and damaged or destroyed 676 houses, leaving 3,279 people homeless. About 50% of the houses in Caye Caulker were destroyed, with reports of only five dwellings still standing after the storm. In San Pedro, about 30% of houses, or at least 50, were wrecked. On <b>Ambergris</b> Caye, four airplanes were destroyed. At Turneffe Atoll, about 35% of the landmass was affected, with many trees in that section uprooted and numerous tree branches snapped.|$|E
5|$|The Abbasids used Alexandria, Damietta, Aden and Siraf as entry ports to India and China. Merchants {{arriving}} from India {{in the port}} city of Aden paid tribute in form of musk, camphor, <b>ambergris</b> and sandalwood to Ibn Ziyad, the sultan of Yemen. Moluccan products shipped across the ports of Arabia to the Near East passed through the ports of India and Sri Lanka. Indian exports of spices find mention in the works of Ibn Khurdadhbeh (850 CE), al-Ghafiqi (1150), Ishak bin Imaran (907) and Al Kalkashandi (14th century). After reaching either the Indian or the Sri Lankan ports, spices were sometimes shipped to East Africa, where they were used for many purposes, including burial rites.|$|E
5|$|Crowley's {{inheritance}} {{was running}} out. Trying to earn money, {{he was hired}} by George Montagu Bennett, the Earl of Tankerville, to help protect him from witchcraft; recognising Bennett's paranoia as being based in his cocaine addiction, Crowley took him on holiday to France and Morocco to recuperate. In 1907, he also began taking in paying students, whom he instructed in occult and magical practice. Victor Neuburg, whom Crowley met in February 1907, became his sexual partner and closest disciple; in 1908 the pair toured northern Spain before heading to Tangier, Morocco. The following year Neuburg stayed at Boleskine, where he and Crowley engaged in sadomasochism. Crowley continued to write prolifically, producing such works of poetry as <b>Ambergris,</b> Clouds Without Water, and Konx Om Pax, as well as his first attempt at an autobiography, The World's Tragedy. Recognising the popularity of short horror stories, Crowley wrote his own, some of which were published, and he also published several articles in Vanity Fair, a magazine edited by his friend Frank Harris. He also wrote Liber 777, a book of magical and Qabalistic correspondences that borrowed from Mathers and Bennett.|$|E
5|$|When {{merchant}} ships docked, {{the merchandise}} {{was taken into}} official custody and taxes levied on all items sold. The security of the merchandise was guaranteed by the administration officials. Traders of many nationalities (Arabs, Persians, Guzerates, Khorassanians) settled in Calicut, drawn by the thriving trade business. Ship building prospered and keeled ships of 1000–1200 bahares (burden) were built without decks by sewing the entire hull with ropes rather than fastening them with nails. Ships sailed to the Red Sea ports of Aden and Mecca with Vijayanagara goods sold {{as far away as}} Venice. The empire's principal exports were pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, myrobalan, tamarind timber, anafistula, precious and semi-precious stones, pearls, musk, <b>ambergris,</b> rhubarb, aloe, cotton cloth and porcelain. Cotton yarn was shipped to Burma and indigo to Persia. Chief imports from Palestine were copper, quicksilver (mercury), vermilion, coral, saffron, coloured velvets, rose water, knives, coloured camlets, gold and silver. Persian horses were imported to Cannanore before a two-week land trip to the capital. Silk arrived from China and sugar from Bengal.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Keith was an Atlantic {{hurricane}} in October 2000 {{that caused}} extensive damage in Central America, especially in Mexico and Belize. It was the fifteenth tropical cyclone, eleventh named storm, and seventh hurricane of the that year's Atlantic hurricane season. Keith {{developed as a}} tropical depression from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on September28. The depression gradually strengthened, and became Tropical Storm Keith on the following day. As the storm tracked westward, it continued to intensify and was upgraded to a hurricane on September30. Shortly thereafter, Keith began to rapidly deepen, and peaked as a Category4 hurricane less than 24hours later. Keith then began to meander erratically offshore of Belize, which significantly weakened the storm due to land interaction. By late on October2, Keith made landfall in <b>Ambergris</b> Caye, Belize as a minimal hurricane. It quickly weakened to a tropical storm, before another landfall occurred near Belize City early on the following day. While moving inland over the Yucatán Peninsula, Keith weakened further, and was downgraded to a tropical depression before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on October4. Once in the Gulf of Mexico, Keith began to re-strengthen and was upgraded to a tropical storm later that day, and a hurricane on the following day. By late on October5, Keith made its third and final landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico as a moderately strong Category 1 hurricane. The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated as a tropical cyclone by 24hours after landfall.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{name for}} amber {{is thought to}} come from the Arabic word, ambar, meaning <b>ambergris.</b> <b>Ambergris</b> is the waxy {{aromatic}} substance created in the intestines of sperm whales and was used in making perfumes both in ancient times as well as modern.|$|E
25|$|Ambergris: Lumps of {{oxidized}} fatty compounds, whose precursors were secreted and expelled by {{the sperm}} whale. <b>Ambergris</b> {{should not be}} confused with yellow amber, which is used in jewelry.

25|$|Trading {{relations}} were established with Malacca in the 15th century, with cloth, <b>ambergris</b> and porcelain being the main commodities of the trade. Giraffes, zebras and incense were exported to the Ming Empire of China, which established Somali merchants as {{leaders in the}} commerce between East Asia and the Horn.

25|$|The {{scent of}} amber was {{originally}} derived from emulating {{the scent of}} <b>ambergris</b> and/or labdanum but due to the endangered species status of the sperm whale the scent of amber is now largely derived from labdanum. The term “amber” is loosely used to describe a scent that is warm, musky, rich and honey-like, and also somewhat oriental and earthy. It can be synthetically created or derived from natural resins. When derived from natural resins it is most often created out of labdanum. Benzoin is usually part of the recipe. Vanilla and cloves are sometimes used to enhance the aroma.|$|E

25|$|Among the {{earliest}} accounts of East Africa, {{the works of}} Al-Masudi describe early Islamic trade routes, and how the coast and islands were frequently visited by Muslims including Persian and Arab merchants and sailors in search of coral, <b>ambergris,</b> ivory, tortoiseshell, gold and slaves. They also brought Islam {{to the people of}} the Zanj including the Comoros. As the importance of the Comoros grew along the East African coast, both small and large mosques were constructed. Despite its distance from the coast, the Comoros is situated along the Swahili Coast in East Africa. It was a major hub of trade and an important location in a network of trading towns that included Kilwa, in present-day Tanzania, Sofala (an outlet for Zimbabwean gold), in Mozambique, and Mombasa in Kenya.|$|E

25|$|The {{treasure}} ships had {{an enormous}} cargo of various products. Admiral Zheng returned to China with many kinds of tribute goods, such as silver, spices, sandalwood, precious stones, ivory, ebony, camphor, tin, deer hides, coral, kingfisher feathers, tortoise shells, gums and resin, rhinoceros horn, sapanwood and safflower (for dyes and drugs), Indian cotton cloth, and <b>ambergris</b> (for perfume). They even brought back exotic animals, such as ostriches, elephants, and giraffes. There was so much cobalt oxide from Persia that the porcelain center Jingdezhen had a plentiful supply for decades after the voyages. The fleet also returned with such {{a large amount of}} black pepper that the once-costly luxury became a common commodity in Chinese society. It has been said that there was sometimes so many Chinese goods unloaded into a single foreign port that it could take about three months to price everything. The treasure voyages resulted in a flourishing Ming economy, while boosting the lucrative maritime commerce to an all-time high.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century, Duarte Barbosa {{noted that}} many ships from the Kingdom of Cambaya in India sailed to Mogadishu with fabric and spices, {{for which they}} in return {{received}} gold, wax and ivory.

500|$|Spermaceti oil (called [...] "sperm" [...] for short), {{from which}} the whale derives its name, was a prime target of the whaling industry, and was {{dominant}} for use in oil lamps, lubricants, and candles. <b>Ambergris</b> is a solid waxy waste product from its digestive system. It is still highly valued as a fixative in perfumes and other uses. It remains as flotsam from deceased whales, and is sought by beachcombers. The species is now protected by a whaling moratorium, and is currently listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
500|$|The {{sperm whale}} has the longest {{intestinal}} {{system in the}} world, exceeding 300 m in larger specimens. Similar to ruminants the sperm whale has a four-chambered stomach. [...] The first secretes no gastric juices and has very thick muscular walls to crush the food (since whales cannot chew) and resist the claw and sucker attacks of swallowed squid. The second chamber is larger and is where digestion takes place. Undigested squid beaks accumulate in the second chamber – as many as 18,000 {{have been found in}} some dissected specimens. Most squid beaks are vomited by the whale, but some occasionally make it to the hindgut. [...] Such beaks precipitate the formation of <b>ambergris.</b>|$|E

[...] Winds approached 120mph (193km/h) at Nassau before the anemometer failed. In addition to the winds, the storm dropped heavy rainfall in the region, totaling 9in (228mm) in Nassau. As in Puerto Rico, authorities in the Bahamas had ample warning of {{the hurricane}}'s approach, and preparations minimized the loss of life in the islands. Two boats were wrecked as they washed ashore in Grand Turk, although the crews were saved. A sloop traversing from <b>Ambergris</b> Caye to Grand Turk was lost, killing all 18people on board.

It occurs {{as far south}} as the Mexican state of Campeche, {{northern}} Guatemala and northern Belize, and is found on the offshore islands of Cozumel, Isla Mujeres, <b>Ambergris</b> Caye, Caye Caulker, Lighthouse Reef and Glover's Reef. Although the type specimen of the bird was apparently collected in northwestern Honduras in 1855 or 1856, it has not been recorded in that country since, and must have been rare if it was ever there. Some authors feel that the specimen might have been mislabeled, and have come instead from northwestern [...] "British Honduras" [...] as Belize was then called. There is also a single specimen of a black catbird collected from Brownsville, Texas in 1892.

500|$|The {{title and}} {{first line of}} the song refer to an island called San Pedro, held {{by some to be}} <b>Ambergris</b> Caye in Belize, {{referencing}} the town of San Pedro, which has since adopted the song's title as the town's principal nickname. However, Gaitsch has mentioned that at that time, Madonna was spending time in a US town of the same name, and both Madonna and her then husband Sean Penn were good friends with a poet called San Pedro and novelist Charles Bukowski. Madonna herself has not clarified this in any interview. Instead, she referred the song as being a tribute to Latin America and its people, along with an island and to herself. In 2014, while working on her thirteenth studio album Rebel Heart with producer Diplo, Madonna recorded a dubplate of [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] with new lyrics for his Major Lazer project.

People from Norway and Japan started hunting whales around 2000 B.C. Whales are typically hunted for their meat and blubber by aboriginal groups; they used baleen for baskets or roofing, and made tools and masks out of bones. The Inuit hunted whales in the Arctic Ocean. The Basques started whaling {{as early as}} the 11th century, sailing as far as Newfoundland in the 16th century in search of right whales. 18th- and 19th-century whalers hunted whales mainly for their oil, which was used as lamp fuel and a lubricant, baleen or whalebone, which was used for items such as corsets and skirt hoops, and <b>ambergris,</b> which was used as a fixative for perfumes. The most successful whaling nations at this time were the Netherlands, Japan, and the United States.|$|E
