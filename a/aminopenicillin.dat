40|$|<b>Aminopenicillins</b> are {{the most}} used {{beta-lactam}} antibiotics. Morbilliform or maculopapular rashes are rather frequent during therapy with <b>aminopenicillins.</b> The pathogenesis of these reactions is often due to a cell-mediated allergy. The aim of this work is to characterize patients with cell-mediated allergy to <b>aminopenicillins</b> and to identify alternative beta-lactam drugs that can be safely administered to these patients. We studied 27 subjects affected by cell-mediated allergy to <b>aminopenicillins.</b> The diagnosis was {{made on the basis}} of positivity of patch tests with <b>aminopenicillins.</b> These patients then underwent an allergological evaluation (skin and patch tests, oral and/or intramuscular challenge tests) with a wide spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics. Our work highlights the following main characteristics of cell-mediated allergy to aminopenicillins: time elapsing between drug administration and onset of symptoms of about 2 days; the maculopapular rash and delayed appearance of urticaria/angioedema were the most typical symptoms (82. 8 percent of cases); a cross-reactivity with aminocephalosporins is usually absent, or it is limited to cephalexin (in our study, in fact, just 3 out of 20 patients challenged with cephalexin showed a positive oral challenge test); all the beta-lactams, other than <b>aminopenicillins,</b> are well tolerated. Patch tests represent a specific diagnostic tool with a good predictive value of identifying alternative drugs that can be safely administered to patients with beta-lactam allergy. Our patients could tolerate other beta-lactam drugs after a complete allergological evaluation. On the basis of our study, cell-mediated allergy to <b>aminopenicillins</b> should be considered a well-defined nosologic entity...|$|R

40|$|A {{nationwide}} susceptibility {{surveillance of}} 1, 113 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates {{was carried out}} and found the following percentages of resistance: cefuroxime, 46 %; penicillin, 37 %; macrolides, 33 %; <b>aminopenicillins,</b> 24 %; cefotaxime, 13 %; and ceftriaxone, 8 %. A significant (P < 0. 05) seasonality pattern for β-lactam antibiotics was observed. Resistance to macrolides was higher (P < 0. 05) in middle-ear samples. Higher percentages of resistance to cefuroxime and macrolides were observed among penicillin-intermediate and -resistant strains, whereas high frequencies of resistance to <b>aminopenicillins</b> and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins were observed only among penicillin-resistant strains...|$|R

50|$|Hetacillin is a {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic {{that is part}} of the <b>aminopenicillin</b> family. It is a prodrug and it has no {{antibacterial activity}} itself, but quickly splits of acetone in the human body to form ampicillin, which is active against a variety of bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Ciclacillin (INN) or cyclacillin (USAN), {{trade names}} Cyclapen, Cyclapen-W, Vastcillin, and others, is an <b>aminopenicillin</b> antibiotic. Its {{spectrum}} of activity {{is similar to that}} of ampicillin, although it is less susceptible to beta-lactamases than ampicillin and has much higher bioavailability. A large randomized, double-blind clinical trial published in 1978 also showed that ciclacillin is associated with significantly fewer and milder adverse effects than ampicillin; later studies seemed to confirm this improved tolerability, at least in children.|$|E
50|$|H. alvei is a {{commensal}} of {{the human}} gastrointestinal tract and not normally pathogenic, but may cause disease in immunocompromised patients. It is often resistant to multiple antibiotics, including the <b>aminopenicillins.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Aminopenicillins</b> {{feature a}} {{positively}} charged amino group that enhances their uptake through bacterial porin channels.

50|$|The <b>aminopenicillins</b> are a {{group of}} {{antibiotics}} in the penicillin family that are structural analogs of ampicillin (which is the 2-amino derivative of benzylpenicillin, hence the name).

50|$|It is a moderate-spectrum, bacteriolytic, β-lactam {{antibiotic}} in the <b>aminopenicillin</b> family used {{to treat}} susceptible Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better-absorbed, following oral administration, than other β-lactam antibiotics. In general, Streptococcus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus, Haemophilus, Helicobacter, and Moraxella are susceptible to amoxicillin, whereas Citrobacter, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are resistant to it. Some E. coli and most clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus have developed resistance to amoxicillin to varying degrees.|$|E
30|$|Intriguingly, the {{combination}} of <b>aminopenicillin</b> and beta-lactamase inhibitor was negatively associated with ESBL-PE pneumonia in carriers, indicating that this drug favoured another aetiology than ESBL-PE, mostly non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli. Indeed, antibiotics ineffective against P. aeruginosa significantly {{increase the risk of}} colonization or infection with P. aeruginosa [21, 22]. Most ESBL-PE were resistant or had intermediate susceptibility in vitro to <b>aminopenicillin</b> and beta-lactamase inhibitor. Thus, the apparent protective effect of <b>aminopenicillin</b> and beta-lactamase inhibitor on the occurrence of ESBL-PE pneumonia may not be attributed to antimicrobial efficacy, but rather to the selection of P.aeruginosa as a causative agent of pneumonia.|$|E

40|$|Pneumonia {{is one of}} {{the leading}} deadly {{diseases}} of childhood. Every year, about two million children less than five years of age die because of pneumonia. Group B streptococci and gram-negative rods are the most common pathogens in the newborn period. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most commonly encountered bacterial species causing pneumonia in the post-neonatal period. Chlamydia trachomatis is the agent of afebrile pneumonia in the first one to three months of life. Viruses are the main causes of pneumonia in children less than five years of age whereas the leading causative agent in older children is Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Tachypnea is the most specific and sensitive sign of pneumonia in children aged 0 to five years. Radiologic investigation is not an essential part of the management of pneumonia. Ampicillin plus gentamycin in newborns, an <b>aminopenicillin</b> in children aged 1 to 60 months, and an <b>aminopenicillin</b> plus a macrolide in older children are appropriate antimicrobial regimens for pneumonia. In those necessitating intensive care, an anti-staphylococcal antibiotic should be started. Education and immunization are important measures in prevention...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Infections of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are becom-ing an {{increasingly}} concerning clinical problem. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the development of MRSA in urine cultures in a major public university-affiliated hospi-tal and the therapeutical and hygiene-related possibilities for reducing resistance. Materials and Methods: This study included 243 samples from patients diagnosed with MRSA infection over a period of 6 years. An agar diffusion test measured the effects of antimicrobial agents against bacteria grown in culture. The analyses were based on the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Results: A regression analysis was performed, which showed 100 % resistance to the following antibiotics throughout the entire testing period: carbapenem, cephalosporin (1 st– 4 th generation), penicillin G, <b>aminopenicillin,</b> β-lactamase, and isoxazolyl penicillin. However, a significant decrease in resistance was found for amikacin, genta-micin, clindamycin, levofloxacin, erythromycin, and mupirocin.

40|$|Abstract: Sixty samples each {{of salted}} Sardine, Mugil cephalus (Feseikh) and Hydrocynus froskallii (Molouha); (30 each of {{low and high}} salted fish) were {{subjected}} for enumeration, isolation and identification of Staphylococcus aureus. 154 strains of S. aureus were isolated, 47 strains from salted sardine, 55 from feseikh and 52 from molouha. The antimicrobial sensitivity revealed that the coagulase positive S. aureus isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, streptomycin, neomycin, amikacine, vancomycine, methicillin, erythromicine, <b>aminopenicillin</b> and tetracycline with a percentage of 100, 98, 98, 96. 6, 94. 9, 91. 5, 84. 7, 74. 6, 69. 5 and 59. 3 % respectively. Moreover the isolates showed 19 different patterns of antimicrobial resistance. Meanwhile, 100, 96, 58 and 24 % of coagulase negative S. aureus isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, neomycin and streptomycin; vancomycin anderythromycin; methicillin and tetracycline; and <b>aminopenicillin</b> respectively. Identified S. aureu sisolates were confirmed by PCR by using 2 oligonucleotides primers of genes Sau 234 - 1501 andCOAG 2 -COAG 3. Results showed that all isolates were S. aureus and coagulase positive except one strain.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundEnterobacteriaceae {{bacteremia}} is {{a common}} complication in patients with neoplasm. The cancer itself, chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression, and other cancer-related procedures play a role as predisposing factors for this condition. However, despite the clear association between cancer and Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia, the distinctive clinical characteristics of patients with cancer presenting with Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia have not been well established. MethodsThe population studied was a prospective cohort of adult hospitalized patients with Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia in a tertiary care hospital. We compared the clinical variables and microbiological features between patients with an underlying neoplasm (n= 203) and those without (n= 259). STATA software was used for statistical association analysis. ResultsIn a bivariate analysis, older age, prior exposure to <b>aminopenicillins,</b> fewer days of symptoms, biliary source of bacteremia, greater severity of APACHE II score, lower white blood cell and platelet counts, {{and the presence of}} Klebsiella pneumoniae were more common in the neoplasm group. In a multivariable analysis, K. pneumoniae bacteremia (odds ratio (OR) 6. 13, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 65 – 22. 71; p= 0. 007), APACHE II score (OR 1. 18, 95 % CI 1. 05 – 1. 34; p= 0. 007), and exposure to <b>aminopenicillins</b> (OR 28. 84, 95 % CI 1. 94 – 429. 3; p= 0. 015) were associated with neoplasm. K. pneumoniae bacteremia was more commonly present in patients with lung and gastrointestinal cancers. ConclusionsWe have confirmed the association of K. pneumoniae bacteremia with underlying neoplastic disease, especially with gastrointestinal malignancies, which may allow stratification for initial empiric antibiotic therapy in this subset of patients. Prior exposure to <b>aminopenicillins</b> in the neoplasm group might contribute to this finding...|$|R
40|$|Clostridium difficile {{infection}} (CDI) is a {{major cause}} of morbidity in the nosocomial environment.

However, HugA does not affect cephamycins or carbapenems and is inhibited by clavulanic acid. Similar to other Proteus species, P. penneri is resistant to tetracyclines and nitrofurantoin.|$|R
40|$|Rational {{outpatient}} therapy restricts antibiotics to infections {{where they}} are beneficial and selects substances based on local resistance patterns. Respiratory tract infections typically caused by viruses should not be treated with antibiotics (e. g., rhinitis, bronchitis, sinusitis). Many respiratory infections likely caused by bacteria can be treated with <b>aminopenicillin,</b> sometimes combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Quinolones should be used only as exception for respiratory tract infections, since resistance is rising. For this reason uncomplicated urinary tract infections (cystitis) should be treated with trimethoprim-sulfa-methoxazole (TMP-SMX) instead of quinolones, even though approximately 20 % of Escherichia coli are resistant to TMP-SMX. Skin and soft tissue infections are best treated with beta-lactam antibiotics, {{as long as the}} community acquired methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus frequently seen in certain countries remain uncommon here...|$|E
30|$|Clindamycin, a {{lincosamide}} antibiotic, {{is usually}} added to penicillin or <b>aminopenicillin</b> since it inhibits the protein synthesis by blocking the 50 S sub-unit of the bacterial ribosome. It thus may therefore block {{the production of}} exotoxins such as the superantigens [54, 55]. The effect of decreased production of superantigens by clindamycin treatment has been demonstrated in animal studies [56]. Interestingly, penicillin and clindamycin both inhibit in vitro {{the production of the}} streptococcus superantigen pyrogenic exotoxins A (SPEA) and B (SPEB) isolated in S. pyogenes strains implicated in toxic shock syndrome, but the inhibition by clindamycin was significantly more important [57, 58]. Besides, the prolonged post-antibiotic activity and the lack of an inoculum effect (an increase in the minimal inhibitory concentration of an antibiotic when the number of organisms increases) may be desirable properties in the treatment of STSS.|$|E
40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae {{no longer}} has {{predictable}} antibiotic susceptibility. There are two areas of high prevalence of resistance (over 25 %) to /J-lactam antibiotics in the South-West and North-East of Europe. In Spain, a close relationship has been found between the yearly rate of <b>aminopenicillin</b> consumption and penicillin resist-ance. High level resistance (MIC ^ 1 mg/L) has developed against a previous background of low level resistance. The serotypes involved in penicillin resistance in Spain are widespread in other countries. Macrolide resistance is high in France (over 15 %) and is also increasing in other countries.

40|$|Of 53 {{documented}} {{cases of}} Yersinia enterocolitica septicemia {{reported to the}} French national registry between 1985 and 1991, 43 files contained sufficient information on antibiotic treatment to be analyzed retrospectively. All patients had at least two positive cultures of blood collected before the initiation of treatment. All strains were susceptible in vitro to the antibiotics that are usually active against gram-negative rods except for older fl-lactam agents (i. e., <b>aminopenicillins</b> and first-generation cephalosporins). No multiresistant strain was isolated. Only four (7. 5 %) of the 53 patients died. <b>Aminopenicillins,</b> first-generation cephalosporins, and—when prescribed alone—amoxicillin/clavulanate were not effective. Third-generation cephalosporins, most often used {{in combination with other}} antibiotics, were successful in 85 % of cases. Fluoroquinolones-alone or in combination—cured all of 15 infections, with patients improving rapidly and becom-ing apyretic within 1 - 4 days. These agents therefore seem to constitute the best treatment.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} if correlations exist between income inequality and antimicrobial resistance. This study’s hypothesis is that income inequality at the national level is positively correlated with antimicrobial resistance within developed countries. Data collection and analysis: Income inequality data were obtained from the Standardized World Income Inequality Database. Antimicrobial resistance data were obtained from the European antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network and outpatient antimicrobial consumption data, measured by Defined daily Doses per 1000 inhabitants per day, from the European Surveillance of antimicrobial Consumption group. Spearman’s correlation coefficient (r) defined strengths of correlations of:> 0. 8 as strong,> 0. 5 as moderate and> 0. 2 as weak. Confidence intervals and p values were defined for all r values.

40|$|A {{geographical}} {{analysis of}} how commonly prescribed oral antibiotics are quantitatively and qualitatively {{responsible for the}} different local rates of erythromycin and penicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae in Spain is presented. From 1998 to 1999 a multicenter surveillance study yielded 1, 684 consecutive S. pneumoniae isolates from community-acquired respiratory infections. Data on antibiotic sales in the retail market {{for the same period}} were gathered, and the corresponding defined doses per 1, 000 inhabitants per day were calculated. Macrolides and β-lactams were considered separately. Macrolides were subdivided into thrice-, twice-, and once-a-day macrolides, and β-lactams were split into <b>aminopenicillins</b> and cephalosporins. Univariate Spearman nonparametric coefficients (R) were calculated, and variables proving to be significantly associated (P < 0. 1) were entered into several multiple lineal regression models. Ample variation in both resistance rates and antibiotic consumption was seen. Multivariate analyses showed that integrated consumption of both macrolides and β-lactams accounted well for erythromycin (R 2 = 0. 722; P = 0. 002) and penicillin (R 2 = 0. 706; P = 0. 002) resistance. Macrolides were more important drivers for local differences in both erythromycin and penicillin resistance than β-lactams were.
