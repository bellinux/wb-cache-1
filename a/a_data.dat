5000|$|In a 1982 article, Musser {{defined the}} genus Apomys {{and gave the}} first modern {{description}} of <b>A.</b> <b>datae,</b> while also correcting Sanborn's mistake {{in the identification of}} his collection. It was revealed that Sanborn had not been the only one to get the major species of Apomys from Luzon cofused: the holotype of the species Apomys Major, described by Gerrit Smith Miller of the Smithsonian Institution in 1910, turned out to have been a specimen of <b>A.</b> <b>datae,</b> while the other animals to have been identified as A. major were discovered to be examples of A. abrae. Since that time, Apomys major has been considered a subjective synonym of <b>A.</b> <b>datae.</b> Musser identified <b>A.</b> <b>datae</b> as {{the only member of the}} [...] "Apomys datae group" [...] within the genus, being different from all other species. In 1993 and 1994, the species was observed in the Sierra Madre, at an altitude between 760 and 1650 m, but this probably concerns a population of a separate, undescribed species. A second species within the <b>A.</b> <b>datae</b> group was described by Luis Ruedas, in 1995: Apomys gracilirostris. In the 21st century, the knowledge about <b>A.</b> <b>datae</b> was expanded with data from genetic research. In 2002, the karyotype was revealed, and in 2003, the phylogenetic relationship with A. gracilirostris was confirmed, based on common features in the species' DNA. Most recently, the animal has been found on several new locations in North Luzon.|$|R
