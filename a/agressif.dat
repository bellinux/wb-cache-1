50|$|On April 25, 2014, LGD Gaming {{announced}} that they would form a youth team called LGD.CDEC. They were named CDEC after the 'Chinese Dota Elite Community', an inhouse league, and the team largely consisted of young talent from that league. In October 2014, LGD.CDEC left the LGD Gaming brand to establish a separate brand called CDEC Gaming, with the roster of <b>Agressif,</b> Maybe, 333, Garder and Q. CDEC showed promising signs of talent (especially Maybe, the team's mid player); however, following a disappointing 4th-place finish at the LAN finals of D2L Season 5, 333 left the team. He was temporarily replaced by the team's coach, former TyLoo and Vici Gaming player mikasa. CDEC were passed over for a direct invite to the Dota 2 Asia Championships and instead had to fight {{their way through the}} Asian Qualifiers where they came in second place. Despite their earlier promising results, they fared quite poorly at the group stage at DAC, where they were eliminated after placing 14th. Following DAC, the Chinese scene underwent a period of roster shuffles which resulted in mikasa leaving to coach LGD Gaming and up-and-coming mid player Maybe also leaving to play for LGD. The team soon added Shiki and Xz to complete their roster. In May 2015, CDEC were invited to play in the The International 2015 Chinese Qualifiers. Despite not losing a single match in their group, CDEC failed to qualify directly to TI5 and instead were forced to go through the Wild Card. CDEC managed to defeat Vega Squadron and MVP Phoenix in order to secure one of the two wild card slots in the main event. During the group stage CDEC managed to surprise practically everyone as they fought their way to second place in their group, behind eventual champions Evil Geniuses. Despite their performance in their group, CDEC still came in as underdogs in the upper bracket; however, they shocked the world with their dominance on the main stage. CDEC went through the upper bracket without dropping a single game in any of the 3 series they played, which secured their place in the grand finals. In the grand finals CDEC faced Evil Geniuses and even though they had just beaten EG 2-0 in their previous series, CDEC lost the grand finals 1-3.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This is {{the third}} {{in a series of}} three articles. Taken together, these three papers review the {{published}} literature on the psychopharmacology of aggression. The objective is to guide clinicians toward a rational choice of pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of aggressive symptoms presented across the diagnostic spectrum. In the first two articles, we outlined a model for the classifica-tion of aggression, together with the method we used to search and review the literature (1, 2). In this article, we fo-cus on the use of beta blockers and antipsychotics (APs). We then come to some conclusions and attempt to use these to introduce what we believe is a useful algorithm to guide clinicians.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the vocal repertoire of forest litter frog Leptobrachium hasseltii from Situgunung Resort, Mount Gede Pangrango National Park. Two types of calls were identified: advertisement call and aggressive call. Each types were represented by two different characteristics thus {{four types of}} calls were examined. The kruskall and wallis {{test was used to}} test the difference of nine features. Pearson’s correlation test also used to determine the relationship of all call features to air temperature and body size. Dominant frequency of all call types was relatively similar. Advertisement calls type I was emitted in short duration and fewer notes than advertisement call type II. Aggressive call type I and have longer call duration compared to both of advertisement call. However the introductory note of aggressive call type II was more longer than the others. Aggressive call of L. hasseltii tended to be discrete (territorial and encounter) and represented two different continuums. This were caused by the extreme differences of both calls in duration and distance between males when emitting calls. Dominan frequencies of all call types inverse correlated with body size of frogs. Most of temporal features of advertisement call type II correlated with body size and only call duration were longer with increasingly air temperature. Interpulse-interval and pulse period were more longer by increasing the body size, while the introductory note, pulse rate and pulse repetition rate were becoming shortened and it could predict male body size to facilitated competition between males, thus serves as mate selection indicator.   Key words: advertisement call, <b>agressif</b> call, Leptobrachium hasseltii, Situgunung resort, social interaction</em...|$|E
