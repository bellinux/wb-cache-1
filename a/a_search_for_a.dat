5|$|During Miller's tenure the synagogue's {{neighborhood}} {{began to}} deteriorate. Members started moving uptown, and the congregation embarked on <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new location. In 1963 Beth Israel purchased {{a block of}} land at 7000 Canal Boulevard at Walker Street in the Lakeview neighborhood. It moved into its new larger building there in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. If this is the case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system {{would have to have}} a mass that is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. <b>A</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E
5|$|Brown put {{the odds}} for the {{existence}} of Planet Nine at about 90%. Greg Laughlin, one of the few researchers who knew in advance about this paper, gives an estimate of 68.3%. Other skeptical scientists demand more data in terms of additional KBOs to be analysed or final evidence through photographic confirmation. Brown, though conceding the skeptics' point, still thinks that there is enough data to mount <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new planet.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Dull began <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new {{official}} symbol {{to represent}} the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-war Ford. Dull's search would entail newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate this vehicle. The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960. Dean Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot.|$|E
5|$|Live and Let Die (1973) is {{the eighth}} spy {{film in the}} James Bond series to be {{produced}} by Eon Productions, {{and the first to}} star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, it was the third of four Bond films to be directed by Guy Hamilton. Although the producers had wanted Sean Connery to return after his role in the previous Bond film Diamonds Are Forever, he declined, sparking <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new actor to play James Bond. Moore was signed for the lead role.|$|E
5|$|Press {{coverage}} in the following days, after Howe's statement that no bomb had been found, continued {{to focus on the}} act planned by the IRA; several newspapers reported <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fourth member of the team. Reports of the discovery of the bomb in Marbella appeared to vindicate the government's version of events and justify the killings. Several MPs made statements critical of the operation, while a group of Labour MPs tabled a condemnatory motion in the House of Commons.|$|E

5|$|Sadat {{also played}} his role the {{deception}} plan; in September he had attended the Non-Aligned conference in Algeria, and {{upon his return}} was rumored to be ill. Sadat remained, for several {{days leading up to}} 6 October, out of public sight. Egyptian intelligence planted false stories of his illness in the press and initiated <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> home in Europe, where Sadat would receive treatment, adding to the rumor's credibility.|$|E
5|$|To provide {{realistic}} bodies while {{preventing the}} corpses from moving, {{after a lengthy}} casting process the crew chose extras who could lie as still as possible. For the bath house owner Tsuyako Yamashita, this was not possible owing {{to the need to}} see her alive first, and <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> body double was unfruitful. Ultimately, the crew used digital effects to transplant a still image of the actor during the character's funeral scene, allowing for a realistic effect.|$|E
5|$|A {{major problem}} was that of loss of feed {{material}} and product. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the feed material became finished product. About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks. The problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons. Extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} recover product, including burning the carbon receiver liners to recover the uranium in them. Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha product and 5.4 percent of Beta product was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> safer production process.|$|E

5|$|Ash died in 1887, and the United Hebrew Orthodox Congregations (now called The Association of American Orthodox Hebrew Congregations) began <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> successor, {{to serve}} as rabbi of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol and as Chief Rabbi of New York City. This search was opposed by Rabbi Henry Pereira Mendes, of Congregation Shearith Israel. Mendes felt that the money and energy would be better spent on {{supporting}} the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA), which he had co-founded with Sabato Morais in 1886. In his view, training American-born rabbis at the Seminary would {{be a much more}} effective means of fighting the growing strength of American Reform Judaism: these native English-speaking rabbis would appeal to the younger generation far more than imported, Yiddish-speaking ones.|$|E
5|$|Chester {{had planned}} to retire in June 2009, and the {{congregation}} embarked on <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new senior rabbi in 2008. Twenty-three candidates were narrowed down to one finalist, but in early December that individual informed the search committee that he was withdrawing his name from consideration. While the search was progressing, Chester had realized that, due to the 2008 financial crisis, {{he would have to}} keep working. After the main candidate withdrew, the synagogue's president approached Chester, asking if he would stay on for another term, which Chester agreed to do. Chester retired in June 2011, becoming (along with Broude) Rabbi Emeritus.|$|E
5|$|Still {{photographs}} and scripts {{for the production}} survive, as do some amateur off-air reel-to-reel audio tape recordings of four of Dylan's songs. In 2005 the BBC launched <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> video recording of the play, uncovering some audio recordings of the songs, {{but it seems that}} a full off-air audio copy does not exist. In April 2007, BBC Four broadcast a documentary about the making of the play in the Arena strand, featuring interviews with Saville, Jones, Martin Carthy, Peggy Seeger, Dylan collector Ian Woodward, and the first re-broadcast of the songs from the play. In November 2008, BBC Radio 2 broadcast a documentary, narrated by Bob Harris, about Dylan's visit to London and the making of the play.|$|E
50|$|Economists {{have studied}} {{a number of}} optimal {{stopping}} problems similar to the 'secretary problem', and typically call this type of analysis 'search theory'.

5|$|The {{stories were}} written when Irish {{nationalism}} {{was at its}} peak and <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> national identity and purpose was raging; at a crossroads of history and culture, Ireland was jolted by converging ideas and influences. The stories centre on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many {{of the characters in}} Dubliners later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel Ulysses. The initial stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists. Subsequent stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence and maturity.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, the Portland Water Committee, {{predecessor}} of the Portland Water Bureau, began <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> superior {{drinking water}} source. The committee, led by Henry Failing, commissioned Isaac W. Smith, {{an engineer and}} surveyor, to inspect any viable water supply in the region. Smith chose the Bull Run River, and a five-month survey trip led him to conclude that a gravity-flow system could deliver clean water from Bull Run to Portland. In 1892, U.S. President Benjamin Harrison signed a proclamation creating a protected area, the Bull Run Reserve, in the watershed. By 1895 Portland had built a diversion dam on the Bull Run River, and completed its first conduit (Conduit 1) to carry Bull Run water to the city. At {{about the same time}} as the Smith survey, a small farming community, at first named Unavilla but renamed Bull Run in 1895, grew up near the confluence of the Bull Run and Sandy rivers. Meanwhile, improvements to the Barlow Road encouraged population growth along the lower Sandy and the establishment of cities like Gresham and Sandy. Even so, by 1900 much of the upper Sandy basin was still remote, wild, and accessible mainly by trails.|$|E
5|$|The Ramblin' Wreck, {{the iconic}} 1930 Ford Model A Sport coupe {{that serves as}} the {{official}} mascot of the student body, was acquired in this era. The Wreck is present at all major sporting events and student body functions, and leads the football team into Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, a duty it has performed since 1961. Dean of Student Affairs Jim Dull recognized a need for an official Ramblin' Wreck when he observed the student body's fascination with classic cars. Fraternities, in particular, would parade around their House Wrecks as displays of school spirit and enthusiasm. It was considered a rite of passage to own a broken-down vehicle. In 1960, Dull began <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new official symbol to represent the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-war Ford. Dull's search employed newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate this vehicle. The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960 when Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot. When Johnson returned to his car, he found a note from Dull attached to his windshield. Dull's note offered to purchase the car to serve as Georgia Tech's official mascot. Johnson, after great deliberation, agreed to take $1,000; he eventually returned the money in 1984 so that the car would be remembered as an official donation to Georgia Tech and the Alexander-Tharpe Fund. The Ramblin' Wreck was officially transferred to the Athletic Association on May 26, 1961.|$|E
