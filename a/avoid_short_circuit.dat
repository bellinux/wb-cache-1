This work explores redundancy, which is a well-known fault tolerance technique, for variation tolerance.

We show how to <b>avoid</b> <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> and estimate delay in dual-driver nets which are caused by gate splitting. A spin-off gate placement heuristic is developed to minimize redundancy cost.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis describes a method of minimising the total losses of an inverter-fed 3 -phase squirrel-cage induction motor when the motor,is subjected to a pulse-width modulated (PWM) voltage waveform. The inverter is supplied from a d. c. link and operates at variable frequency to provide speed control of the motor. Appropriate triggering of the inverter's six main thyristors generates pulse-width modulated voltage waveforms for application to the induction motor. The operation of an induction motor with nonsinusoidal voltage applied results in a reduction of the motor's efficiency due to the harmonics present in the waveform. The aim of the project is to minimise the total losses by obtaining optimum PWM voltage waveforms rather than by improving {{the design of the}} motor. This requires a thorough examination of motor losses. The determination of a RiM voltage waveform which may be produced by the described inverter is subjected to ccnstraints which characterise the operation of the drive system. The motor operates with constant airgap flux density throughout its speed range to obtain maximum output power at fixed per unit slip. In addition the switching frequency of the thyristors must not exceed a specified limit to <b>avoid</b> <b>short</b> <b>circuiting</b> of the inverter. The calculation of the motor's steady-state performances for both sine wave and PWM supplies is incorporated in a computer program. The detail of the experimental and theoretical performances are given and comparison is made between sinusoidal and PWM voltage wave systems. Good agreement is obtained between test and calculated results on an inverter-fed 7. 5 kw squirrelcage induction motor. It is concluded that the degradation of motor efficiency due to the applied PWM voltage waves is mainly the result of increased copper losses, which are produced by harmonic currents. The minimisation of the losses for continuous, constant-flux, operation of the induction motor is achieved for the given constraints. It is found that the total losses can be further minimised if the d. c. link voltage is variable. This permits improved motor performance but adds complexity and cost to the d. c. link voltage supply...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of DC-DC converter in standard CMOS process faces challenges {{from the low}} transistor breakdown voltages, poor quality factor and large size on-chip capacitors and inductors. The standard solution {{to deal with the}} problem of MOS transistor’s low breakdown voltage is using cascode configuration in the output stage. High-side PMOS and low-side NMOS power transistors in on-chip buck converter are switched ON and OFF with non-overlapping driving signals whose duty- cycle regulate the output voltage of converter. The non-overlapping driving signals are required to avoid short-circuit losses through power transistors. By using the cascode configuration, driving signals for high-side PMOS and low-side NMOS power switching transistors operate in different voltage domains. To overcome this problem, the voltage level shifters are needed to transfer driving signals between two voltage domains. However, associated power losses and additional timing delays in conventional level shifters may deteriorate the overall efficiency of converter. In order to avoid the losses and timing delays associated with the level shifters, a self-triggered buck converter is proposed in this work. The high-side driving signal is generated from the converter output via inductive feedback. The inductive feedback eliminates the required level shifters needed for transferring the driving signal to highside power transistor. The inductive feedback has fast response and provides adaptive dead-time that <b>avoids</b> <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> losses with no additional hardware. Output voltage regulation is realized by controlling the duty-cycle of the signal switching the low-side NMOS transistor. Simulations are done on Cadence 45 nm CMOS General Process Design Kit(GPDK) and show that the efficiency of self-triggered converter (64. 25 %) is better than the efficiency of a hard-switching buck converter(63. 21 %), even when the level shifter losses and delays are not taken into account.

USE - The method is useful for detecting {{chemical or biological}} species such as proteins, preferably enzymes e. g. phosphatases (claimed), molecular complexes, peptides, antigens, nucleic acids and nucleic acid containing species.
