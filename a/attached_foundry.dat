50|$|Moira Furnace was a coke-fuelled, steam-engine blown {{blast furnace}} for the {{smelting}} of iron from local iron ore, with an <b>attached</b> <b>foundry</b> for {{the manufacture of}} cast-iron goods.|$|E
50|$|The <b>attached</b> <b>foundry</b> {{continued}} {{to be used for}} some years, using brought-in pig iron, though it was demolished later in the 19th century. Meanwhile the bridgehouse and the engine house, which was a separate building {{to the side of the}} furnace, were converted to dwellings and survived. However, by the 1970s they had become derelict and affected by mining subsidence and the engine house was demolished. After pressure by Philip Riden and from Leicestershire Industrial History Society, the furnace and bridgehouse were scheduled as an ancient monument. The site was acquired by North West Leicestershire District Council in 1981, who sponsored a Community Programme to restore the site and develop it as a museum and country park.|$|E
50|$|James Easton {{became a}} {{successful}} businessman in ironwork and was well-connected in the Boston area. He ran a vocational school for persons of color, <b>attached</b> to his <b>foundry,</b> from about 1816 to 1830. His son Hosea participated in it, {{with his brother}} James who became a homeopathic physician.|$|R
50|$|Up until 1900, {{the site}} where Sainsbury's {{supermarket}} now sits was an orchard, with an <b>attached</b> small <b>foundry.</b> Before the First World War, James Apperley founded the Dudbridge Patent Machine Works to manufacture textile machinery, but after his business failed H G Holbrow manufactured steam engines, and then J D Humpidge manufactured gas engines. In the late 1920s, Hampton cars were assembled there. After their failure, the site reverted to a foundry until the late early 1990s, home to the cupola iron furnaces of Lewis & Holes Ltd.|$|R
40|$|Out of 106 men {{employed}} in a <b>foundry</b> <b>attached</b> {{to a large}} factory, 29 men developed a photosensitization dermatitis over the period of three months. Three men out of 1, 700 {{employed in}} the remainder of the works developed a similar eruption, but no common factor was apparent. Owing to the very high incidence in the foundry, a sensitizer associated with the process was suspected and it seemed likely that it would prove to be an atmospheric contaminant. Many chemical investigations and skin tests were carried out without positive result, though much interesting information regarding combustion products of various materials was obtained...|$|R
