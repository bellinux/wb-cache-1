40|$|Abstract. Outermost-needed rewriting/narrowing is a {{sound and}} {{complete}} optimal demand-driven strategy for the class of inductively sequential constructor systems. Its parallel extension, known as weakly, deals with non-inductively sequential constructor systems. Recently, refinements of (weakly) outermost-needed rewriting <b>and</b> <b>narrowing</b> have been obtained. These new strategies are called natural rewriting <b>and</b> natural <b>narrowing,</b> respectively, <b>and</b> incorporate a better treatment of demandedness. In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} how to implement natural rewriting <b>and</b> <b>narrowing</b> efficiently by using a refinement of the notion of definitional tree, which we call matching definitional tree. We also show how to compile natural rewriting <b>and</b> <b>narrowing</b> to Prolog <b>and</b> provide some promising experimental results. ...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of erosion of {{sandstone}} and the erosion-resistant sills and dikes, the topography in Minnesota has repeated parallel hills and valleys. The tightly packed lakes in the narrow valleys are long <b>and</b> <b>narrow,</b> and they orient from the east to west. The cliffs in these narrow valleys are the habitat to several rare plants which prefer living in narrow cliff areas in a sub-Arctic climate. In Ontario the Rove Formation is overlain by a thick diabase cap.|$|E
5|$|Emmendingen {{lies in the}} Elz valley, which {{winds through}} the Black Forest. The Elz creates a series of hanging valleys which {{challenge}} the passage of large bodies of troops; the rainy weather further complicated the passage through the Elz valley. The area around Riegel am Kaiserstuhl is noted for its loess <b>and</b> <b>narrow</b> transition points, which greatly influenced the battle.|$|E

The Sogdian clothing underwent a thorough process of Islamization {{in the ensuing}} centuries, with few of the original elements remaining. In their stead, turbans, kaftans, and sleeved coats became more common.|$|E

5|$|I Bonaparte {{chose to}} ride across the alps on a mule (obtained at a convent at Martigny) {{rather than a}} steed, the typical gentleman's mount at the time, because the mule was {{considered}} to be more sure-footed on the slippery slopes <b>and</b> <b>narrow</b> passes of the Alps, and to be more sturdy and hardy while making such a perilous journey on such volatile terrain.|$|E
5|$|In both later {{works such}} as Caroline Mordaunt and her earlier evangelical texts, Sherwood participated in the Victorian project of {{prescribing}} gender roles; while her later works outlined ever more stringent <b>and</b> <b>narrow</b> roles for each sex, her early {{works such as}} The Fairchild Family suggested such demarcations as well: Lucy and Emily learn to sew and keep house while Henry tends the garden and learns Latin.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} metonymy and cases of category broadening <b>and</b> <b>narrowing</b> <b>and</b> the resulting state of vertical polysemy (e. g., cat ‘domestic cat’ > ‘any feline’ and drink ‘consume liquid’ > ‘consume alcohol’). Broadening <b>and</b> <b>narrowing</b> have been argued to be motivated by metonymic processes where a category member stands for the whole category or vice versa (Radden and Kövecses, 1999; cf. also Lakoff, 1987). Here, I {{show that there is}} a crucial difference between the domain structures involved in metonymy and in vertical polysemy. Unlike metonymies, broadening <b>and</b> <b>narrowing</b> do not involve a shift in the salience of domains (see Croft, 1993). Instead, I argue that there are four possible domain configurations that may underlie vertically related meanings...|$|R

It has been crossed with both cybister and single flower cultivars to produce hybrids with unusual striping.|$|E
5|$|One branch would {{evolve into}} cetaceans, {{possibly}} beginning about , with the protowhale Pakicetus and other early whale ancestors collectively known as Archaeoceti, which eventually underwent aquatic adaptation into the completely aquatic cetaceans. The other branch became the anthracotheres, {{a large family}} of four-legged beasts, the earliest of which in the late Eocene would have resembled skinny hippopotamuses with comparatively small <b>and</b> <b>narrow</b> heads. All branches of the anthracotheres, except that which evolved into Hippopotamidae, became extinct during the Pliocene without leaving any descendants.|$|E

5|$|The snout {{is rather}} short, broad, and rounded, without {{prominent}} flaps of skin beside the nostrils. The eyes {{are large and}} circular, with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). There are 1113 tooth rows in either half of both jaws.

The five pairs of gill slits are moderately long, with the third gill slit over {{the origin of the}} pectoral fins. The first dorsal fin is high and falcate (sickle-shaped). There is a low interdorsal ridge running behind it to the second dorsal fin, which is relatively large with a short free rear tip. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over or slightly forward of the free rear tips of the pectoral fins, and that of the second dorsal fin lies over or slightly forward of the anal fin. The pectoral fins are long <b>and</b> <b>narrow,</b> tapering to a point. The dermal denticles are closely spaced and overlapping, each with five (sometimes seven in large individuals) horizontal low ridges leading to marginal teeth.|$|E
