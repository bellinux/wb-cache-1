40|$|Usage {{efficiency}} {{of mechanical engineering}} products is determined by level of their operating capability. Expenses connected with provision of operating capability for the whole operational period exceed initial cost of the products by 6 - 10 -fold. Moreover, while being used the expenses {{have a tendency to}} increase with reduction of <b>output</b> <b>parameters</b> that ensure product application efficiency for its intended purpose. It is necessary to take into account these changes at manufacturing stages of mechanical engineering products. Maximum efficiency can be obtained at the operational stage of the product life cycle only as a result of complex and interrelated measures during designing, manufacturing and usage of the specific product for its intended purpose with due account of its <b>output</b> <b>parameter</b> dynamics. While using the product an analysis of its <b>output</b> <b>parameter</b> dynamics will make it possible to determine maximum value of the operating capability, operational expenses and best practices for obtaining maximum profit per operating time unit. Taking hydroficated excavators of the 5 th grade as an example the paper presents dynamics of main <b>output</b> <b>parameters</b> at the operational stage of their life cycle; reveals the main factor influencing on intensity of hydroficated machine operating capability reduction; substantiates an expediency of taking into account <b>output</b> <b>parameter</b> dynamics while evaluating {{efficiency of}} its usage; proposes a methodology for determination of or a pay-off time period for recoupment of expenses pertaining to machine procurement and optimum time period for operational stage, its life cycle that corresponds to obtaining maximum profit. Nowadays constant values of main <b>output</b> <b>parameters</b> (operating capability, self cost of machine-hour) corresponding to the beginning of operation are {{to be taken into account}} while determining expediency of machine creation. Practically they significantly change in the process of machine operation this fact must be taken account while creating a machine and using it for its intended operational purpose and ensuring its operating capability. The proposed methodology for maintaining and restoration of operating capability of construction and road-building machines was published previously [3].

The lathe machine {{was chosen because}} of its widespread availability {{and its ability to}} perform various tasks without much change in its structure. Also using lathe machines is very cheap and hence it is beneficial from economic point of view as well. The turning operation was specifically chosen because of the various advantages that it offers. It can be used for machining a large variety of materials and it is cheaper than milling. OHNS (Oil Hardened Non Shrinking) tool was chosen due to its hardness. These materials are used only for dies so it was chosen so that its industrial usage could be exploited. To comprehend the usage, all the input and <b>output</b> <b>parameters</b> that could affect the machining process, namely input parameters like feed, cutting conditions, speed, etc. and <b>output</b> <b>parameters</b> like surface roughness, surface finish, material removal rate were analyzed using the researches that had already been done on CNC turning.
