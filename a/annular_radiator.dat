The experimental results show that the temperature is not uniform along the radiator height because of the air flow non-uniformity. The internal flow field was numerically investigated and a variable fin pitch optimization method was {{presented to}} reduce the flow non-uniformity. The porous medium model was used to predict the radiator pressure drop. The simulation accuracy was verified by the experimental data. The numerical results show that the flow non-uniformity is greatly influenced by the fan diameter and height ratio and can be reduced by the variable fin pitch method. cf 201...|$|R
5000|$|The {{next major}} {{production}} versions were the 213E and the similar 213F. These engines were {{equipped with a}} new two-speed, two-stage supercharger that dramatically improved altitude performance. The only {{difference between the two}} models was that the E included an intercooler for additional high-altitude performance, while the F model lacked this and was optimized for slightly lower altitudes. The E and F models were in high demand for many late-war aircraft, including the Junkers Ju 188, Junkers Ju 388, the Langnasen-Dora models of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190D and the Focke-Wulf Ta 152H. All of these aircraft used <b>annular</b> <b>radiators</b> characteristic of the earlier Jumo 211 engine installations on twin-engined aircraft, often standardized as Kraftei (power-egg), completely unitized power plant [...] "modules" [...] for any twin or multi-engined aircraft, much as the Jumo 211 had evolved for earlier aircraft designs - but with the <b>annular</b> <b>radiators</b> noticeably reconfigured for better cooling of the more powerful Jumo 213 engine.|$|R

2500|$|Some of {{the final}} G-series models {{received}} updates to the engines, using a pair of high-altitude Jumo 213E inverted V-12s with the same revised <b>annular</b> <b>radiator</b> design as the 213As already used, or to the radar, using the mid-VHF band FuG 218 Neptun AI radar with either the standardized Hirschgeweih aerials with shorter dipoles to suit the higher frequencies used, [...] or more rarely the advanced Morgenstern 90° crossed-element, six-dipole Yagi-form antenna. Only a very few Ju 88G-6 night fighters were ever fitted with the semi-experimental FuG 240 Berlin N-1 cavity magnetron based, 3GHz-band (centimetric) radar, whose dish antenna was housed in a smoothly contoured radome on the G-6's nose. Only about 15 of the Berlin systems were completed before V-E Day.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} <b>annular</b> <b>{{radiators}}</b> for engine cooling on the Ju 88, which placed these radiators immediately forward of each engine and directly behind each propeller, allowed the cooling lines for the engine coolant and oil-cooling radiators (integrated within the annular design) {{to be as}} short as possible, with integral port and starboard air intakes for cooling the exhaust headers, the starboard inlet also supplying the inlet air for the supercharger.|$|R

NV768 was later fitted with a ducted spinner, similar to that fitted to the Fw 190 V1. Another experimental Tempest V was SN354, which was fitted with a Vickers 47 mm [...] "P" [...] anti-tank gun, under development but never deployed, under each wing in a long [...] "pod".|$|R

5000|$|About {{the same}} time as Lusser was {{designing}} the P.1055, Kammhuber had started looking for an aircraft for his rapidly growing night fighter force. Heinkel quickly re-designed the P.1055 for this role as the P.1060. This design was similar in layout but somewhat smaller and powered by two of the largest displacement (at 44.5 litres/2,700 cu. in.) single-block liquid-cooled aviation engines placed in mass production in Germany, the DB 603 inverted V12 engine. As designed by Heinkel, these engines' nacelle accommodations featured <b>annular</b> <b>radiators</b> similar to the ones on the Jumo 211-powered Junkers Ju 88A, but considerably more streamlined in appearance, and which, after later refinement to their design, were likely to have been unitized as a Heinkel-specific Kraftei engine unit-packaging design. Nearly identical-appearance nacelles, complete with matching <b>annular</b> <b>radiators,</b> were also used on the four prototype He 177B prototype airframes built in 1943-44, and the six ordered prototypes of Heinkel's He 274 high-altitude strategic bombers with added turbochargers. The early DB 603 subtypes had poor altitude performance, which was a problem for Heinkel's short-winged design, but Daimler had a new [...] "G" [...] subtype of the DB 603 powerplant meant to produce 1,400 kW (1,900 PS) take-off power apiece under development to remedy the problem. Heinkel was sure he had a winner and sent the design off to the RLM in January 1942, while he funded the first prototype himself. The RLM again rejected the He 219, in favour of new Ju 88- and Me 210-based designs.|$|R
50|$|The Z.1007 was a mid-winged {{monoplane}} with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage. It had {{a crew of}} five, {{consisting of}} two pilots, a flight engineer, a radio operator and a bombardier/navigator. It could carry 800 kg (1,760 lb) of bombs, and was fitted with a defensive armament of a 12.7 mm (.5 in) Breda-SAFAT machine gun in an open dorsal position and a 7.7 mm machine gun in a ventral tunnel. After much experimentation with the prototype, the production aircraft were fitted with <b>annular</b> <b>radiators</b> so their profile was similar to radial engines that would be fitted to the improved later versions. Delivery of production Asso powered Z.1007s started in February 1939, with production ending in October that year.|$|R
50|$|The Ju 188 was {{designed}} to be fitted with either the 1,750 PS (1,290 kW, 1,730 hp) Jumo 213A or 1,700 PS (1,250 kW, 1,680 hp) BMW 801 G-2 engines without any changes to the airframe, with the exclusion of the re-design for Jumo-powered examples, of the <b>annular</b> <b>radiators</b> from their Jumo 211 layout for the A-series to better match the more powerful 213's cooling needs, while still using essentially the same broad-chord three-blade propellers as the A-series did. It was originally intended that both would be known as A models, but the naming was later changed: the Ju 188A model powered by the 213, and the Ju 188E by the 801.|$|R
50|$|One Typhoon, R8694, {{was used}} by Napier for trials with the more {{powerful}} Sabre IV, cooled using an <b>annular</b> <b>radiator</b> and driving a four-bladed propeller.

5000|$|Major {{differences}} between the He 274 and the He 177 A were abandonment of the twin coupled [...] "power system" [...] engine arrangement in favor of four independent DB 603A-2 fully unitized engines, cooled by <b>annular</b> <b>radiators</b> nearly identical in appearance to those on the similarly-powered Heinkel He 219 night fighter {{as an integral part}} of each [...] "unitized" [...] engine's installation, an extended rear fuselage with a twin tail fin empennage, a pressurized double glazed cockpit of nearly identical external appearance to the 177A's standard [...] "Cabin 3" [...] nose, a longer wingspan, and a more conventional, single oleo strut-per-side set of twinned-wheel main undercarriage, abandoning the cumbersome four-strut main gear system of the He 177A, needed for the earlier design's pair of larger-diameter, four-blade propellers.|$|R
50|$|The BV 155C {{was to be}} {{significantly}} different in appearance from the BV 155B. The clumsy wing-mounted radiators of the BV 155B were eliminated, and the main landing gear leg attachment points were moved inboard to retract inwards. Cooling was provided by an <b>annular</b> frontal <b>radiator</b> as in the Focke-Wulf Ta 152. Large circular intakes were attached to the fuselage sides above the wing roots.|$|R
5000|$|The He 274's advanced, high-altitude cockpit, {{despite its}} {{aforementioned}} He 177A-like resemblance from an external view, comprised a pressurized compartment for {{a crew of}} four, this employing double walls of heavy-gauge alloy, hollow sandwich-type glazing and inflatable rubber seals, a pressure equivalent to that at 2,500 m (8,200 ft) being maintained at high altitude. Largely unnecessary defensive armament was restricted to a single forward-firing 13 mm (.51 in) caliber MG 131 machine gun and remotely controlled dorsal and ventral Fernbedienbare Drehlafette FDL 131Z gun turrets each containing a pair of MG 131s and with the dorsal turret operated from a slightly offset Plexiglas domed rotating sighting station in {{the roof of the}} flight deck as most A-series He 177s were, with the ventral unit aimed {{from the rear of the}} ventral Bola gondola. The powerplants selected were the same type of Daimler-Benz DB 603A Kraftei [...] "power-egg" [...] unitized engine installations, complete with their He 219-style <b>annular</b> <b>radiators</b> that were placed on the wings of the quartet of ordered He 177B prototypes, but for the He 274's use, added DVL-designed TK 11 turbochargers, one per engine, for better power output at high altitude.|$|R
50|$|The Daimler-Benz DB 601 inline engines were {{conventionally}} installed {{and equipped}} with three-blade, fully adjustable propellers. The radiators were somewhat unusual however, {{quite similar to}} those fitted to the Junkers Ju 88 which pioneered them, consisting of an annular block located {{in front of the}} engine, but with the Ar 240 partially covering each of them in an oversized propeller spinner, with air entering through a large hole {{in the front of the}} spinner and exiting out of the cowl flaps. As with the Jumo inline-powered versions of the Ju 88, this made the plane look as if it were mounting a radial engine, and the Ar 240, like later Jumo inline-powered fighter aircraft from the Focke-Wulf firm (the Fw 190 D, Ta 152 and twin-engined Ta 154) also benefitted from the simpler setup of an <b>annular</b> <b>radiator</b> just forward of the engine.|$|E
5000|$|The Me 410C was a high-altitude version {{drawn up}} in early 1944, with two new wing designs that {{increased}} span to 18.25 m (60 ft) or 20.45 m (67 ft). The larger wings allowed the gear to retract {{directly to the}} rear. A new universal engine mount would allow {{for the use of}} any of the DB 603JZ or BMW 801J turbocharged engines or the Jumo 213E two-stage mechanically supercharged engines, driving a new four-blade propeller with very wide blades. The BMW 801 radials were air-cooled and the DB 603 and Jumo 213 used an <b>annular</b> <b>radiator,</b> all housed as unitized Kraftei (power-egg) engine [...] "modules" [...] onto an airframe for ease of installation and field maintenance, so the normal under-wing radiators were removed. None were ever built, as Me 410 production was canceled before the engines matured.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Ju 252 {{came about}} after talks between Junkers and Deutsche Lufthansa in December 1938. Lufthansa requested a new design that {{would replace the}} Ju 52, but offer much greater loads, seating, range and performance. Junkers responded with the EF.77 design with a pressurized fuselage with seating for up to 35, {{making it one of}} the larger airliners in the world at that time. It was powered by three Junkers Jumo 211F engines, in nacelles almost identical in appearance, each complete with <b>annular</b> <b>radiator</b> and possibly as Kraftei unitized [...] "power-egg" [...] modular engine installations, to those on Jumo 211-powered versions of the Junkers Ju 88, replacing the BMW 132 of the Ju 52, which dramatically improved performance. Compared to the Ju 52, the Ju 252 was twice as heavy (13,100 kg vs. 5,600), was over 100 km/h faster (440 km/h vs. 305), and had dramatically improved range (3980 km vs. 1300) when fully loaded. Design was headed by Konrad Eicholtz.|$|E
5000|$|For {{aerodynamic}} cleanliness, Günter {{intended to}} dispense with the usual system of drag-producing engine radiators and planned on using a surface evaporative cooling system instead. Such surface cooling - {{in the form of}} simpler surface radiators instead - had been used on British high speed racing seaplanes as early as 1929. This sort of system was pioneered on the eight examples built of the Heinkel He 119 high speed reconnaissance aircraft prototype series, already flying with the twin-crankcase DB 606 [...] "power system" [...] engine with success from the beginning, and was also intended for use on the He 100 high-speed fighter prototypes. The coolant water is pressurized, raising its boiling point, in this case to about 110 °C (230 °F). As the superheated water leaves the engine it enters an expansion area where the pressure drops and the water flashes to steam. The steam is then cooled by running it in pipes along the outer skin of the fuselage and wings. Before the design of the He 177 was finalized, it was clear that such a system would be incapable of dealing with the vast amount of heat generated by each of the twinned DB 601-based powerplants, forcing the abandonment of the idea of using evaporative cooling systems, in favour of conventional <b>annular</b> <b>radiators</b> fitted directly behind each propeller. These resembled, but were larger in capacity than, those fitted to the Junkers Ju 88A bomber, and added to the He 177's weight and drag.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{factor that}} {{seemingly}} required the lower-drag [...] "coupled" [...] powerplant format for the He 177A, the diving attack mandate by the RLM, which Ernst Heinkel vehemently disagreed with since the original Greif's beginnings {{in the late}} 1930s, was rescinded by Göring himself some five months before the [...] "He 277's" [...] earliest-known February 1943 RLM approval date. The Heinkel firm started work on the He 177B as a straightforward, separately four-engined development of the 177A under the B-series designation at least {{as early as the}} late summer of 1943, when official Heinkel documents began referring to the He 177B, evidenced from an August 1943-dated, Heinkel factory-created general arrangement Typenblatt drawing of the He 177 V101 being labeled with the 8-177 RLM designation for the entire line of Greif airframes, and [...] "B-5" [...] elsewhere in the drawing's title block, as a fully RLM approved development of the original He 177 aircraft line, and not in any way directly related to the entirely separate He 277 advanced bomber design project, which by the summer of 1943 was considered to be Heinkel's Amerika Bomber aviation contract contender. The first development of the original He 177A to fly with four [...] "individual" [...] engines - using a quartet of He 219-style <b>annular</b> <b>radiators</b> to cool its likely-unitized Daimler-Benz DB 603 powerplants - was the second He 177B prototype, the He 177 V102, on December 20, 1943.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had a very}} slim fuselage, a high {{parasol wing}} and a single wing-mounted engine nacelle. In the prototype a 560 kW (750 hp) inline Isotta-Fraschini Asso-750.RC engine was fitted, with an <b>annular</b> (circular) <b>radiator</b> that made the installation resemble a radial engine, although {{it was actually a}} liquid-cooled inline. Some versions of other planes such as the Ju 88 and Fw 190D had this same feature. The engine nacelle was extended to carry a rear-facing machine gun, while other guns were mounted in the centre fuselage and nose. All were 7.7 mm (.303 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns. Bombs up to 640 kg/1,410 lb (4 × 160 kg/350 lb) were carried under the wings. The aerodynamic low-drag design was typical of Zappata-designed aircraft, as was the wooden construction.|$|R
5000|$|Design {{work on the}} Jumo 222 {{started in}} 1937. The engine was {{configured}} with six inline cylinder banks spaced at equal angles around the crankcase, each bank having four cylinders. The engine looked like a radial due to the arrangement — this was evident from a cross-sectional drawing of the original version, using a master connecting rod with five additional conrods pivoted from the master rod's crankpin end casting, as with a single-row radial — but the internal workings were designed to operate more like a V engine with each adjacent pair of cylinder banks, each with a crossflow head, and it was liquid-cooled like most inlines. Looking at a complete Jumo 222 from a [...] "nose-on" [...] view, the half-dozen cylinder banks were arranged at 60° equal angles from each other, such that neighbouring banks had their exhaust ports (at the [...] "60°, 180° & 300°" [...] spaces) and intake ports (at the [...] "0°, 120° & 240°" [...] spaces) facing each other, resulting in simpler [...] "plumbing" [...] from the rear-mounted supercharger and resulting in only three sets of exhaust headers. The trio of exhaust header sets would have been most likely present {{at the bottom of}} an engine nacelle, and on the upper quarters to either side (appearing like the exhausts for many Allied [...] "upright" [...] V-style aviation engines) for the shortest possible exhaust outlet routing. The four-cylinder-long multibank design also engendered a shorter (by roughly 80 cm/31 in), larger cross-section cylindrical nacelle design somewhat like the Ju 88A used (and in comparison to them), which could still use an enlarged-diameter variety of <b>annular</b> <b>radiator</b> to cool the 222's cylinders and motor oil, and which for the Junkers Ju 288, intended to use pairs of the in-house multibank powerplants (spinning their propellers in opposing directions, like the He 177A), mounting each <b>annular</b> <b>radiator</b> directly ahead of a Jumo 222's multibank crankcase (as with the Jumo 211s used on the Ju 88A) and using hollow ducted spinners with each of its four-blade propellers, to pass the air rearwards into the annular radiators.|$|E
5000|$|The Reich Air Ministry (RLM) was in {{the process}} of {{ordering}} a [...] "second generation" [...] fast medium bomber to go beyond what the initial Schnellbomber specification had requested in its warload, top speed and range specifications in a design competition known as [...] "Bomber B", but this was extensively delayed due to the non-delivery of the large 2,500 PS (1,840 kW, 2,470 hp)-class engines, like Junkers' Jumo 222 inline engine, that the designs would rely on, but also have insurmountable challenges in developing into combat-reliable sources of propulsion. Although Junkers' Ju 288 was leading the contest, there was no delivery date on the engines and the Ju 88B project was re-submitted as a stop-gap. For this version, they used the latest short-wing Ju 88 A-1 airframe as a baseline with the Ju 88B's new stepless cockpit design, with the new Junkers Jumo 213 engine, which had recently started bench testing and was expected to deliver 1,500 PS (1,100 kW, 1,480 hp) and required a redesigned <b>annular</b> <b>radiator</b> system for engine and oil cooling.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately for {{the design}} team, the Me 209's {{proposed}} DB 603A engine was in short supply and {{they were forced to}} use the Junkers Motorenwerke firm's Jumo 213A engine. Even though the 35 litre engine displacement Jumo 213 had been deliberately designed to have as many of its engine access points as possible made to be identical with the 44.52 litre displacement DB 603 powerplant (Germany's largest-displacement inverted V12 aircraft engine), this changeover required some reconstruction of the engine cowling and cooling system. The most visible change was the required one to the engine's air intake location, as the Jumo 213's supercharger intake was located on the starboard side of the engine (as standard for all models of the earlier Junkers Jumo 211 inverted V12), versus the DB 603's portside location, the standard for all Daimler-Benz inverted V12 engine designs. The Me 209 featured a new tail section, wings, wide-track landing gear, a taller tail and an <b>annular</b> <b>radiator</b> for the inline engine, which gave the engine a superficial resemblance to a radial engine and to the very similar installation on the Focke-Wulf Fw 190D, which used the same Jumo 213 powerplant. The extent of the modifications undermined the original purpose, which was to build a superior aircraft as similar to the existing Bf 109G as possible.|$|E
40|$|An {{annular ring}} {{microstrip}} antenna (ARMSA) with a {{defected ground structure}} for multi-band operation is being proposed. Defected ground structure is produced by integrating a circular slot in the ground plane having different centre with the <b>annular</b> ring <b>radiator</b> patch. Microstrip line feed is used to excite the annular ring patch antenna placed on an FR 4 substrate (dielectric constant εr = 4). Results of the proposed antenna are carried out using Ansoft HFSS simulation software, and compared with the measured results, which shows good agreement. It is observed that the proposed antenna shows four bands at f 1 = 2. 92 GHz, f 2 = 5. 64 GHz, f 3 = 8. 21 GHz, and f 4 = 10. 53 GHz with an impedance bandwidth of 70 %, 50 %, 20 % and 10 % respectively. The proposed antenna is suitable for S, C and X band wireless communication system...|$|R
5000|$|As Germany's largest {{displacement}} inverted V12 aviation powerplant {{in production}} {{during the war}} years, the DB 603 saw wide operational use as the primary engine type for many twin and multi-engined combat aircraft designs — the promising twin-engined Dornier Do 335 Pfeil prototype heavy fighter, the front-line Messerschmitt Me 410 Hornisse heavy fighter and Heinkel He 219 Uhu twin-engined night fighter were all designed for DB 603 power. The Dornier Do 217M and -N medium bomber and night fighter subtypes powered by inline engines, and the enormous sixty-meter wingspan, six-engined Blohm & Voss Bv 238 flying boat prototype, essentially had their DB 603 powerplants installed within {{what appeared to be}} the same unitized complete engine/cowl/radiator assembly as a complete unit-replaceable [...] "power system" [...] for twin and multi-engined aircraft — this particular design featured a [...] "chin"-style radiator installation directly beneath the crankcase, and the oil cooler placed on the dorsal portion of the installation. The He 219 airframe pioneered what is believed to be a Heinkel-specific Kraftei unitized engine package for the DB 603 engine using a well-streamlined <b>annular</b> <b>radiator</b> set for primary engine cooling between the propeller and its reduction gear housing with a nearly-cylindrical cowl behind it, pierced only by the twin rows of six exhaust stacks, one row per side. The characteristic portside-cowl supercharger intake for Daimler-Benz inverted V12s was usually accommodated away from the nacelle's sheetmetal itself for the Heinkel/DB 603 unitized engine package, most often within the airframe's wing panel design. The same Kraftei packaging for the He 219 was also used for powering the four-prototype He 177B strategic bomber series, and with an added turbocharger in each nacelle, the six ordered (two completed) prototypes of Heinkel's He 274 high-altitude strategic bomber project.|$|E
5000|$|Inline and radial engines {{were both}} {{incorporated}} into the Kraftei concept : the Junkers Jumo 211 was a pioneering example of engine unitization, as used on both the Junkers Ju 88 using a novel <b>annular</b> <b>radiator</b> for both main engine coolant and engine oil cooling needs, with exactly the same nacelle packaging used to power the Messerschmitt Me 264 V1's first flights. Both the examples of the Dornier Do 217 medium bomber powered by inline engines, and the Axis Powers' largest-flown powered aircraft of any type, the Blohm & Voss BV 238 flying boat used essentially the same unitized Daimler-Benz DB 603 powerplants, complete with [...] "chin" [...] radiators under the nacelles as integral components. A differing Kraftei physical packaging is also {{believed to have been}} crafted by the Heinkel firm for the DB 603 engines used on its Heinkel He 219A night fighter, as {{what appears to be the}} same exact engine installation design used for the He 219A was also used for the quartet of ordered airframes for the same firm's He 177B four-DB 603-engined heavy bomber design's prototype series, as both airframe types' engine [...] "units" [...] used annular radiators and cylindrical cowls of identical appearance to enclose them. The air-cooled BMW 801 fourteen-cylinder, twin-row radial engine was also provided in both formats for a number of German designs, especially for twin and multi-engined airframes, with the [...] "M" [...] or [...] "T" [...] first suffix letter designating whether it was a Motoranlage (the original format of the Kraftei concept) or the more comprehensively consolidated Triebwerksanlage format unitized powerplant — the BMW-designed forward cowling ring always used with the 801 incorporated the engine's oil cooler, making it an easy task for aviation engineers to use for such a [...] "unitized" [...] mounting concept.|$|E
