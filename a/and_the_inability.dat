5|$|The {{economy of}} the small island of Cyprus with 840,000 people was hit by several huge blows in and around 2012 including, amongst other things, the €22 billion {{exposure}} of Cypriot banks to the Greek debt haircut, the downgrading of the Cypriot economy into junk status by international rating agencies <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> {{of the government to}} refund its state expenses.|$|E
5|$|In Saint Lucia, downpours {{triggered}} torrential flooding {{along the}} island's easternmost coast from October5 through October6. In Dennery Quarter, flash floods affected about 500 households; among them, 400 had their houses flooded or severely damaged.

Residents also suffered from the absence of drinking water, lack of electricity, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> to prepare meals due {{to the loss of}} kitchen equipment and other utensils. In response, the area was declared a disaster zone; a total of EC$500,000 ($185,185USD) was approved to assist flood victims, as well as an additional US$44,194 allocated from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.|$|E

Myriad's business model of exclusively offering the diagnostic test led from Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012; it also led to controversy over high prices <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> to get second opinions from other diagnostic labs, which in turn led to the landmark Association for Molecular Pathology v.

The engine was further tested and cleared for limited sprint racing at 2,783hp (2,075kW) at 3,400rpm and +21lb (1.45bar) of boost, but this capability was not used due to concerns with the S.6B's airframe {{not being able to}} withstand the power, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> of the aircraft to lift the extra fuel required to meet the increased consumption.|$|E
