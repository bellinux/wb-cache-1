5|$|As well as {{the work}} on reactor development, the Metallurgical Laboratory studied the {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of plutonium, and worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium.

5|$|British {{palaeontologist}} David Bruce Norman has stressed how remarkable {{it is that}} Owen, {{who previously}} had propounded that dinosaurs were active quadrupedal animals, largely neglected Scelidosaurus though it {{could serve as a}} prime example of this hypothesis and its fossil {{was one of the most}} complete dinosaurs found at that time. Norman explained this by Owen's excessive workload in this period, including several administrative functions, polemics with fellow-scientists <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> a large number of even more interesting newly discovered extinct animals, such as Archaeopteryx. Norman also pointed out that Owen in 1861 suggested a lifestyle for Scelidosaurus that is very different from present ideas: it would have been a fish-eater and partially sea-dwelling.|$|E

5|$|Streltsov was {{released}} on 4 February 1963, five years into his twelve-year sentence, and owing to the ban from professional play began to split his time between work at the ZiL factory <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> automotive engineering at the attached technical college. After failing to patch up his differences with Alla, he married Raisa Mikhailovna in September 1963. He started {{to play for the}} amateur factory team, which caused it to attract large crowds, both at home and away. When the ZiL side travelled to Gorky for an away match late in the 1964 season, the team's coach received orders from above not to play Streltsov, something which spectators noticed immediately when the match started; during the first half, they began to riot and threatened to burn down the stadium, chanting Streltsov's name. Worried that the angry crowd might go through with this, the Gorky factory chief ordered the ZiL coach to send Streltsov out for the second half. On stepping onto the field, the former Gulag prisoner received a standing ovation.|$|E

5|$|The {{paintings}} depict isolated figures {{enclosed in}} spaces that are undefined, overwhelmingly claustrophobic, reductive and eerie. Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially {{in how they}} utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun {{in the winter of}} 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Vel√°zquez, while the focus has become the open mouth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the human scream.|$|E

Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887‚Äì1943) from 1914 to 1940 produced accounts of the geography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.|$|E

The {{total complement}} of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome. A systematic attempt to determine the structures of proteins representing every possible fold is known as structural genomics.|$|E
