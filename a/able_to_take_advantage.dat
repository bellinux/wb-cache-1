5|$|In Nevada's final {{regular season}} game, Kaepernick led the Wolf Pack in a second-half {{comeback}} to defeat Louisiana Tech. The seventh win guaranteed Nevada a berth {{in one of}} the three WAC tie-in bowls. The Wolf Pack finished the season in a three-way tie for second place in the WAC alongside Hawaii and Louisiana Tech. Hawaii had a standing contract with the home-town Hawaii Bowl where it played Notre Dame. Louisiana Tech, having lost to both Nevada and Hawaii, appeared unlikely to be selected for a bowl at all. However, the Bulldogs were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> of a provisional WAC berth in the Independence Bowl since neither the Big 12 nor the Southeastern Conference could provide eligible teams. Two other WAC teams achieved bowl eligibility with 6–6 records. Fresno State secured a slot in the New Mexico Bowl, but San Jose State was unable to find an at-large berth.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} in Scotland had seemed resolved when Edward {{left the country}} in 1296, but resistance soon emerged {{under the leadership of}} William Wallace. On 11September 1297, a large English force under the leadership of John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, and Hugh de Cressingham was routed by a much smaller Scottish army led by Wallace and Andrew Moray at Stirling Bridge. The defeat sent shockwaves into England, and preparations for a retaliatory campaign started immediately. Soon after Edward returned from Flanders, he headed north. On 22July 1298, in the only major battle he had fought since Evesham in 1265, Edward defeated Wallace's forces at the Battle of Falkirk. Edward, however, was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> of the momentum, and the next year the Scots managed to recapture Stirling Castle. Even though Edward campaigned in Scotland both in 1300, when he successfully besieged Caerlaverock Castle and in 1301, the Scots refused to engage in open battle again, preferring instead to raid the English countryside in smaller groups.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Reasoning {{is one of}} the {{essential}} application areas of the modern Semantic Web. At present, the semantic reasoning algorithms are facing significant challenges when dealing with the emergence of the Internet-scale knowledge bases, comprising extremely large amounts of data. The traditional reasoning approaches have only been approved for small, closed, trustworthy, consistent, coherent and static data domains. As such, they are not well-suited to be applied in data-intensive applications aiming on the Internet scale. We introduce the Large Knowledge Collider as a platform solution that leverages the service-oriented approach to implement a new reasoning technique, capable of dealing with exploding volumes of the rapidly growing data universe, in order <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantages</b> of the large-scale and on-demand elastic infrastructures such as high performance computing or cloud technology...|$|R

5|$|The fleet {{returned}} to waters off Okinawa on 4 May and renewed its {{attacks on the}} airfields on the Sakishima Islands. Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings, second {{in command of the}} BPF, and his staff had determined that bombardment of Japanese gun positions by the heavy guns of battleships and cruisers might be a more effective method of destroying them than aerial attack. They detached King George V and Howe, as well as five cruisers, that morning to bombard Nobara and Hiara airfields while fighters flew a protective CAP over them and spotted the fall of their shells. The loss of the most effective anti-aircraft ships was more important than anticipated and the Japanese were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> of the opportunity. The carrier had just launched two Corsairs for bombardment-spotting duties and the deck park of eleven Avengers was being moved forward to allow aircraft to land when an undetected Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter attacked at 11:31. The Zero first strafed the flight deck before any of Formidables guns could open fire and then turned sharply to dive into the forward flight deck despite the ship's hard turn to starboard. The fighter released a bomb shortly before it would have impacted the deck and was destroyed by the bomb's blast, although the remnants of the Zero struck Formidable.|$|E

40|$|International audienceGeographic routing {{protocols}} show good properties for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). They are stateless, local and scalable. However they require that each node {{of the network}} is aware of its own position. While {{it may be possible}} to equip each node with GPS receiver, even if it is costly, there are some issues and receiving a usable GPS signal may be difficult in some situations. For these reasons, we propose a geographic routing algorithm, called HGA, <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantages</b> of position informations of nodes when available but also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> continue the routing in a more traditional way if position information is not available. We show with simulations that our algorithm offers an alternative solution to classical routing algorithm (non-geographic) and offers better performances for network with a density above 25 and more than 5 % of nodes are aware of their position...|$|R
