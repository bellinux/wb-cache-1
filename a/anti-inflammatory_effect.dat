5|$|Cortisol is {{the main}} {{glucocorticoid}} in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by corticosterone instead. Glucocorticoids have many effects on metabolism. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of glucose. This {{is the result of}} an increase in the mobilization of amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of free fatty acids, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. Glucocorticoids also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including the suppression of the immune system and a potent <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effect.</b> Cortisol reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} oil has displayed antimicrobial properties in vitro, and can {{function as a}} biopesticide, especially regarding Tropidion castaneum beetles and Camponotus maculatus carpenter ants. Several terpenoids isolated from P.atriplicifolia have been investigated for potential inhibitory effects on the hepatitis B virus. Its traditional use as an anti-inflammatory {{has been attributed to}} the ability of the lignan (+)-taxiresinol and five other compounds to act as leukotriene antagonists. The isorinic acid derivative perovskoate may also contribute to an <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effect</b> as an arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. Interaction with opioid and cannabinoid receptors has been proposed as the mechanism of traditionally reported analgesic effects.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIntravenous {{immunoglobulin}} G (IVIG) {{is used in}} {{the therapy}} of various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. The mechanisms by which IVIG exerts <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> are not completely understood. IVIG interacts with numerous components of the immune system including dendritic cells, macrophages, T and B cells and modulate their functions. Recent studies have reported that heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) pathway {{plays an important role in}} the regulation of inflammatory response in several pathologies. Several therapeutic agents exert <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> via induction of HO- 1. Therefore, we aimed at exploring if <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> of IVIG are mediated via HO- 1 pathway. Confirming the previous reports, we report that IVIG exerts <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> on innate cells as shown by the inhibitory effects on IL- 6 and nitric oxide production and confers protection in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. However, these effects were not associated with an induction of HO- 1 either in innate cells such as monocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages or in the kidneys and liver of IVIG-treated EAE mice. Also, inhibition of endogenous HO- 1 did not modify <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> of IVIG. These results thus indicate that IVIG exerts <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> independent of HO- 1 pathway...|$|R

25|$|The {{specific}} {{mechanisms by}} which drotrecogin exerts its effect on survival in patients with severe sepsis is not completely understood. In vitro data suggest that activated protein C exerts an antithrombotic effect by inhibiting factors Va and VIIIa, {{and that it has}} indirect profibrinolytic activity by inhibiting plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In vitro data also suggest that activated protein C may exert an <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effect</b> by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor production, by blocking leukocyte adhesion to selectins, and by limiting the thrombin-induced inflammatory responses within the microvascular endothelium.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatories, {{regardless}} of the inflammation's cause; their primary anti-inflammatory mechanism is lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis. Lipocortin-1 both suppresses phospholipase A2, thereby blocking eicosanoid production, and inhibits various leukocyte inflammatory events (epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst, etc.). In other words, glucocorticoids not only suppress immune response, but also inhibit the two main products of inflammation, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. They inhibit prostaglandin synthesis {{at the level of}} phospholipase A2 {{as well as at the}} level of cyclooxygenase/PGE isomerase (COX-1 and COX-2), the latter effect being much like that of NSAIDs, potentiating the <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
40|$|It {{is thought}} that the <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> of {{glucocorticoids}} (GCs) are largely due to GC receptor (GR) -mediated transrepression of NF-κB and other transcription factors, whereas side effects are caused by activation of gene expression (transactivation). Selective GR modulators (SGRMs) that preferentially promote transrepression should retain anti-inflammatory properties whilst causing fewer side effects. Contradicting this model, we found that <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> of the classical GC dexamethasone were partly dependent on transactivation of the dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP 1) gene. We wished to determine whether <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> of SGRMs are also mediated by DUSP 1...|$|R

Results KHU 14 exhibited <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> in animal models of acute and chronic inflammation. The anti-inflammatory activity of KHU 14 observed was comparable to that of celecoxib.

40|$|The <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> and {{molecular}} mechanism of 6, 8 -diprenyl- 7, 4 ′-dihydroxyflavanone (DDF), {{one of the}} flavanones found in Sophora tonkinensis, were assessed in vitro through macrophage-mediated inflammation in the present study. The <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> of DDF were not previously reported. DDF inhibited the production of nitric oxide and the expression of tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin- 1 β, and interleukin- 6. Furthermore, the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages was suppressed by treatment with DDF. Therefore, DDF demonstrated potentially <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effects</b> via the blockade of NF-κB and ERK activation in macrophages...|$|R

Despite the importance of other cardiovascular risk factors, high HDL was associated with fewer cardiovascular events independent of LDL reduction. Other effects include anti-thrombotic and vascular inflammation, improving endothelial function, and plaque stability. Adipokines are the adipocytes’ produced mediators. Some adipokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukins and chemokines, have pro-inflammatory effect and some others such as adiponectin have <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>effect</b> that regulates inflammatory process, decrease vascular progression and atherosclerosis.|$|E

However, since these results have been obtained from purified cells (and directly applied), the diluted soup in vivo effect is debatable.
