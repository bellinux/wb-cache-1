5|$|A 2003 {{episode of}} Discovery Channel's Unsolved History used modern {{technology}} {{to attempt to}} re-enact the gunfight. They utilized <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>set</b> to recreate a space similar to the lot where the original gun fight took place. They confirmed that the front-to-back wrist wound suffered by Billy Clanton could only have occurred if his arm {{was raised in the}} manner of one holding a pistol, and that the black powder may have obscured the shooters' view of each other. The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses for the prosecution (Sheriff Behan, Ike Clanton, and Billy Clanton) likely offered perjured testimony. They found that Tom McLaury may have been hit by the shotgun round under his armpit as he reached over his horse for a rifle in his scabbard, as the horse turned away from him at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Running {{throughout}} all the many paths his life could take or has taken, the adult Nemo recurringly awakens in a surrealistic world dominated by argyle patterns. This setting seems artificial, like <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>set,</b> and often appears to bleed over into his other lives. Following clues that he finds scattered throughout this city, he ultimately {{arrives at a}} crumbling, abandoned wooden-framed house. He stumbles upon a DVD player {{hooked up to a}} television screen. In the strangely interactive video, the 118-year-old Nemo converses with the 34-year-old one. He explains that the younger man does not exist. This is a universe where Nemo Nobody was never born, and his consciousness is stuck in some sort of limbo. He states that he is experiencing the story from the end and that he must stay alive until 5:50 AM on 12 February 2092.|$|E

5|$|The 2007 {{film was}} also tied into the books. A novelization {{of the movie}} was written {{to look like the}} older books. Two books were also written for the Girl Detective and Clue Crew series that deal with a mystery on <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>set.</b> In 2008, the Girl Detective series was re-branded into trilogies and to have a model on the cover. The mysteries became deeper, with Nancy often making mistakes. These trilogies were also met with {{negative}} fan reception due to Nancy's constant mistakes, shortness of the books, and lack of action. With the new trilogy format, sales began slipping. Simon & Schuster then cut back from six to four books per year. In December 2011, they finally announced that the series was cancelled along with the Hardy Boys Undercover Brothers series.|$|E

In addition to seeing live pandas, crew members learned about the local culture. Katzenberg has stated that Kung Fu Panda 2 incorporates many elements of Chengdu in the film. The film's landscape and architecture also found inspiration from those found at Mount Qingcheng, a renowned Taoist mountain. In an interview with Movieline, Berger stated that ‘we never really thought of this as <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>set</b> in China for Americans; it's <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>set</b> in a mythical, universalized China for everyone in the world'.|$|E

25|$|The Hunter Hereford Ranch was a 1909 {{homestead}} on {{the eastern}} side of Jackson Hole that became a hobby ranch for William and Eileen Hunter in the 1940s.

The property was sold to the Park Service in 1957, but operated as a ranch even after Eileen Hunter's death in 1969.

The museum originated as the Museum of the Cherokee Strip in the 1970s, and reopened on April 1, 2011. Enid also commemorates its land run history each September by hosting the Cherokee Strip Days and Parade. The Humphrey Heritage Village next to the museum offers visitors {{a chance to see}} the original Enid land office and other historical buildings.

Orson Welles' Touch of Evil and John Ford's The Searchers are mentioned prominently {{in more than one}} of his books, and Roxy Music is referenced in virtually every novel he wrote. The imagery in his novels is largely cinematic, with expressions such as [...] "fade in/fade out", [...] "quick cut" [...] and [...] "VistaVision"; and sentences such as [...] "a montage traces the next fifteen years" [...] and [...] "If the last reel of Cheryl's life had been a CinemaScope Technicolor movie...".

500|$|Frankel, who {{had worked}} with Patricia Field on his feature-film debut Miami Rhapsody as well as Sex and the City, knew that what the cast wore would be of utmost {{importance}} in <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>set</b> in the fashion industry. [...] "My approach was to hire her and then leave the room," [...] he joked later. While only Valentino Garavani appeared onscreen, many other designers were helpful to Field. Her $100,000 budget for the film's costumes was supplemented by help from friends throughout the industry. Ultimately, she believes, at least $1 million worth of clothing was used in the film, {{making it one of the}} most expensively costumed movies in cinema history. The single priciest item was a $100,000 Fred Leighton necklace on Streep.|$|E
500|$|Film {{producer}} Joel Silver {{has said}} that after working as scriptwriters on Assassins, the Wachowskis made Bound as an [...] "audition piece" [...] {{to prove that they}} knew what to do on <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>set.</b> Conversely, Lana Wachowski has said Joel [...] "made that up." [...] The Wachowskis themselves claim they [...] "decided simply to focus on making their own directorial debut." [...] They had the idea to write a story about how one might see a woman on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions might be wrong. They wanted to play with stereotypes and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, because {{those are the kinds of}} films that they like to watch. Seeing film noir as a genre within which they could tell a contained story and twist conventions, they described Billy Wilder as a big influence.|$|E
500|$|Dick's {{story was}} first optioned by {{producer}} and writer Gary Goldman in 1992. [...] He created the initial script {{for the film}} with Ron Shusett and Robert Goethals (uncredited). It {{was supposed to be}} a sequel to the 1990 Dick adaptation Total Recall, which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. Novelist Jon Cohen was hired in 1997 to adapt the story for a potential film version that would have been directed by Dutch filmmaker Jan de Bont. Meanwhile, Cruise and Spielberg, who met and became friends on the set of Cruise's film Risky Business in 1983, had been looking to collaborate for ten years. Spielberg was set to direct Cruise in Rain Man, but left to make Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Cruise read Cohen's script, and passed it onto Spielberg, who felt it needed some work. Spielberg was not directly involved in the writing of the script; however, he was allowed to decide whether the picture's screenplay was ready to be filmed. When Cohen submitted an acceptable revision, he called Cruise and said, [...] "Yeah, I'll do this version of the script." [...] In that version, Witwer creates a false disk which shows Anderton killing him. When Anderton sees the clip, his belief in the infallibility of the precogs' visions convinces him it is true, therefore the precogs have a vision of him killing Witwer. At the end, Anderton shoots Witwer and one of the brother precogs finishes him off, because Witwer had slain his twin. Spielberg was attracted to the story because as both a mystery and <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>set</b> 50 years in the future, it allowed him to do [...] "a blending of genres" [...] which intrigued him.|$|E

500|$|Beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with {{a leading}} role in the war film Pearl Harbor as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. She was drawn to the project by the script: [...] "It's so unusual these days to read a script that has those old-fashioned values to it. Not morals, but movie values. It's a big, {{sweeping}} epic....You just never get the chance to do that." [...] Director Michael Bay initially had doubts about casting the actress: [...] "I wasn't sure about her at first...she wore black leather trousers in her screen test and I thought she was a little nasty...it was easy to think of this woman as a slut." [...] He eventually decided to hire her because she wasn't [...] "too beautiful. Women feel disturbed when they see someone’s too pretty." [...] He asked her to lose weight during filming. In a 2004 interview, the actress noted that his comments were [...] "upsetting" [...] and said she wore leather trousers because [...] "it was snowing out. It wasn't exactly like I had my nipple rings in." [...] She felt grateful that she had not had to deal with such criticism at a younger age: [...] "If I had come on to <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>set</b> at [...] age and someone had said, 'You're a bit funny-looking, can you go on a diet?'—I might have jumped off a building. I just didn't have the confidence to put that into perspective at the time." [...] However, speaking in 2011, she said she was [...] "very fond" [...] of Bay. Pearl Harbor received negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "the avid eyed, ruby lipped Kate Beckinsale, the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; she's like Parker Posey without irony." [...] A.O.Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "Mr.Affleck and Ms.Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars." [...] However, Mike Clark of USA Today felt that the [...] "usually appealing Kate Beckinsale" [...] is [...] "inexplicably submerged—like her hospital colleagues—under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didn't wear." [...] The film was a commercial success, grossing $449 million worldwide.|$|E

50|$|For music {{surround}} channel information {{is intended to}} be more direct as in a soundstage there would be direct noise from all around and not ambience as in <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>setting.</b> For this reason surround speakers should not be set up to be strictly diffuse.

2500|$|Most of Haruki Murakami's works use first-person {{narrative}} {{in the tradition}} of the Japanese I Novel. He states that because family plays a significant role in traditional Japanese literature, any main character who is independent becomes a man who values freedom and solitude over intimacy. Also notable is Murakami's unique humor, as seen in his 2000 short story collection, After the Quake. In the story [...] "Superfrog Saves Tokyo", the protagonist is confronted with a 6-foot tall frog that talks about the destruction of Tokyo over a cup of tea. In spite of the story's sober tone, Murakami feels the reader should be entertained once the seriousness of a subject has been broached. Another notable feature of Murakami's stories are the comments that come from the main characters as to how strange the story presents itself. Murakami explains that his characters experience what he experiences as he writes, which could be compared to <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>set</b> where the walls and props are all fake.|$|E
2500|$|Rick Moranis {{drove me}} out of my mind. There's this whole wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults you a couple of times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can't do that on <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>set.</b> And these comedians walk around, and they can say {{whatever}} they want. I'm just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't get laid in a whore house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate me. The first thing he says to me is, [...] "Do you just act cool, or are you really cool?" [...] That was the first sentence out of his mouth to me in Joel Silver's office. And I was like, [...] "Oh... {{this is not going to}} go well." [...] But he was one of Joel's dear friends, and he ended up making a bunch of movies for Disney. I just wasn't that sharp. I wasn't ready for that kind of crap.|$|E
2500|$|Jasek {{revealed}} to TV Week's Jackie Brygel that {{planning for the}} [...] "dramatic" [...] episodes began six weeks before the crash scenes were filmed.

James Mason (Chris Pappas) told Brygel that the crew put {{in a lot of}} time and effort into getting the scenes right. He revealed that when scenes are usually filmed on location, two cameras are used, but for the crash storyline the crew used five to six cameras at the same time to capture the different angles. He called the shoot [...] "fantastic" [...] and later explained to Inside Soap's Sarah Ellis, [...] "It looked like <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>set,</b> with lots of emergency vehicles, and it was shot at night so the place was lit up like a Christmas tree. We used two identical cars, since we had to virtually destroy one of them." [...] A stunt performer who specialises in car crash scenes also worked on the shoot. Jordy Lucas (Summer Hoyland) commented that being off-site was [...] "pretty exciting" [...] because the cast film everything but the street scenes at the show's Nunawading studio. Jordan Smith (Andrew Robinson) added that filming the scenes affected the cast members, saying [...] "It made us all stop and think. I think we all drove home pretty slowly that night!" ...|$|E
