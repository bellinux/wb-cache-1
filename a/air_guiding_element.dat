40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{calculation}} of the magnetic field of beam <b>guiding</b> <b>elements</b> is presented. The method relates the calculation to measurement data of the magnetic field in a direct way. It {{can be applied to}} single beam <b>guiding</b> <b>elements</b> as well as to clusters of elements. The presented description of the magnetic field differs from the classical approach in that it does not rely on power series approximations. It is also both divergence free and curl free, and takes fringe field effects up to any desired order into account. In the field description, pseudodifferential operators described by Bessel functions are used to obtain the various multipole contributions. Magnetic field data on a two-dimensional surface, e. g., a cylindrical surface or median plane, serve as input for {{the calculation of}} the three-dimensional magnetic field. A boundary element method is presented to fit the fields to a discrete set of field data, obtained, for instance, from field measurements, on the two-dimensional surface. Relative errors in the field approximation do not exceed the maximal relative errors in the input data. Methods for incorporating the obtained field in both analytical and numerical computation of transfer functions are outlined. Applications include easy calculation of the transfer functions of clusters of beam <b>guiding</b> <b>elements</b> and of generalized field gradients for any multipole contribution up to any order...|$|R

50|$|In 1995, WCPX {{was one of}} {{the first}} CBS {{affiliates}} to <b>air</b> <b>Guiding</b> Light at 10 a.m. instead of 3 p.m., which was the network's recommended timeslot for the program. Under this arrangement, the program would air on a delay with episodes running one day behind. However, CBS soon discovered that several of its owned-and-operated stations were using the same scheduling for the program as WCPX. CBS then decided to provide two (eventually three) same-day feeds of Guiding Light to its stations (one at 9 a.m., 10 a.m., and 3 p.m.). WKMG <b>aired</b> <b>Guiding</b> Light at 9 a.m., until the soap opera ended its run on September 18, 2009; the practice continues today for its successor program, Let's Make a Deal.

40|$|Abstract. An {{investigation}} path {{starting from}} (Mn,Ni,Co,Fe) 3 O 4 nanometric powder preparation, NTC thick-film characterization, realization and optimization of new planar thermistor geometries to custom design thermistors and their application for temperature and volume airflow sensors was recently determined. The {{aim was to}} make custom designed segmented NTC thermistors printed and sintered on alumina. Two types of volume airflow sensors were formed: indirectly heated and self-heated. A pair of segmented thermistors was placed in an <b>air</b> <b>guide</b> and connected to differential branches of the Wheatstone bridge. A heater {{was placed in the}} middle between the thermistors for the indirectly heated type, while for the self-heated type the same thermistors were self-heated by a constant current source. First the thermistor responses vs. the airflow (calibration curves) were measured, and then thermistor responses in time (inertia) to fast airflow changes from the minimum to the maximum. The results obtained could be applied in air conditioning for <b>air</b> <b>guide</b> flow regulation...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the impact of using <b>air</b> <b>guides</b> attached {{to the front of the}} shelves in an open fronted multi-deck refrigerated display cabinet (ODC). A 2 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of an ODC was created. The infiltration heat loads with and without the guides were predicted. A higher infiltration heat load without the guides was predicted than when the guides were fitted. The reduction in entrainment was predicted to be 34 % equating to an overall reduction in heat load of 24 %. Two cabinets were tested with and without the guides to the EN 23953 test standard. Adding the <b>air</b> <b>guides</b> reduced the maximum temperature test pack by 0. 6 ºC as well as reducing the energy consumption by 15 %. When the cabinet controller was adjusted so that the maximum pack temperatures were the same for the two tests, the aerofoils reduced energy consumption by 17 %...|$|R
