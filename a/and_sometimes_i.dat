Suffering writer’s block {{while working on}} A Passage to India, the novelist was Young’s guest at the Lacket in early May 1922. Shortly afterwards he wrote to Young declaring, “an unfinished novel’s before me now, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> work at it with distaste and despair…You certainly have done more than any individual I know to help me by direct remarks. Your knowledge {{of the business of}} creating seemed to me profounder than that possessed by so-called artists.” These comments suggest that Young gave Forster significant advice and encouragement at a crucial stage on work on the latter’s eventual masterpiece.|$|E

[...] Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film high marks for the acting as well as the special effects.|$|E
500|$|Dave Marsh was {{the first}} music critic to employ the term punk rock: In the May 1971 issue of Creem, he {{described}} ? and the Mysterians, {{one of the most}} popular 1960s garage rock acts, as giving a [...] "landmark exposition of punk rock". Later in 1971, in his fanzine Who Put the Bomp, Greg Shaw wrote about [...] "what I have chosen to call [...] "punkrock" [...] bands—white teenage hard rock of '64–66 (Standells, Kingsmen, Shadows of Knight, etc.)". Lester Bangs used the term [...] "punk rock" [...] in several articles written in the early 1970s to refer to mid-1960s garage acts. In his June 1971 piece in Creem, [...] "Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung," [...] he wrote, [...] "then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter. ... oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> think those were the best days ever." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, garage rock had no {{name and}} was not {{thought of as a}} genre, but as typical {{elemental}} rock of the period. [...] When it began to be recognised in the early 1970s, [...] "garage rock" [...] was not the name initially prescribed. [...] Between 1971-1973 certain rock critics began to speak nostalgically of mid-1960s garage bands (and artists perceived to be in their tradition) as a genre and for several years used the term [...] "punk rock" [...] to characterize it, making it the first musical form to bear the description. [...] Conjuring up the mid-1960s, Lester Bangs in 1971 wrote: [...] "...then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter... oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> think those were the best days ever".|$|E

500|$|The second side of {{the album}} begins with [...] "Bloody Mary Morning", with the male narrator {{ordering}} drinks on a flight from Los Angeles, California to Houston, Texas after his wife unexpectedly left him, with [...] "the smog and haze reminding me of how I feel". In [...] "Phases and Stages/No Love Around" [...] he recalls dragging in at sunrise after another night of carousing: [...] "I come home last Saturday morning, I come home and found you gone." [...] In the sad [...] "I Still Can't Believe You're Gone", [...] the man realizes the vast impact on his life of her leaving. [...] "It's Not Supposed to Be That Way" [...] reflects his inability to accept the situation and his grief, but still in a self-centered way. In [...] "Heaven and Hell", the man expresses his ambivalence about living without his wife, with the lyric: [...] "Sometimes it's heaven, sometimes it's hell, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> don't even know." [...] The final track is [...] "Phases and Stages/Pick Up the Tempo/Phases and Stages", in which the man reveals his inability to change his character, and accepts his nature and its consequences.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{had last}} toured in Australia in 1993 with The Girlie Show World Tour, her fourth concert tour. The country was skipped {{for the next}} five tours until the singer {{released}} her thirteenth studio album, Rebel Heart (2015). To promote the album, Madonna announced the Rebel Heart Tour, and confirmed that she would be coming to Australia with the concert, as well as visit New Zealand for the first time. Before arriving in Australia, Madonna announced an extra show on March 10, 2016, at Melbourne's Forum Theatre. The show was billed as an intimate gig, and was described by the singer as a fusion of music, art and comedy. It was titled as Madonna: Tears of a Clown show and was created for the singer's Australian fans, who had waited for her to perform there for the last 23 years. During her promotional appearance at The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in April 2015, Madonna confessed that she is a [...] "kind of closet comedian" [...] and did a skit on the show; she added, [...] "I always do extravaganzas, they always cost a billion dollars to make ... nobody makes any money ... <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> dream about simplicity."

500|$|Ferguson's {{sense of}} what was [...] "right" [...] {{became the basis for}} the Beiderbecke Romantic legend, which has {{traditionally}} emphasized the musician's Iowa roots, his often careless dress, his difficulty sight reading, the purity of his tone, his drinking, and his early death. These themes were repeated by Beiderbecke's friends in various memoirs, including The Stardust Road (1946) <b>and</b> <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> Wonder (1965) by Hoagy Carmichael, Really the Blues (1946) by Mezz Mezzrow, and We Called It Music (1947) by Eddie Condon. Beiderbecke was portrayed as a tragic genius along the lines of Ludwig van Beethoven. [...] "For his talent there were no conservatories to get stuffy in, no high-trumpet didoes to be learned doggedly, note-perfect as written," [...] Ferguson wrote, [...] "because in his chosen form the only writing of any account was traced in the close shouting air of Royal Gardens, Grand Pavilions, honkeytonks, etc." [...] He was [...] "this big overgrown kid, who looked like he'd been snatched out of a cradle in the cornfields," [...] Mezzrow wrote. [...] "The guy didn't have an enemy in the world," [...] recalled Beiderbecke's friend Russ Morgan, [...] "ut he was out of this world most of the time." [...] According to Ralph Berton, he was [...] "as usual gazing off into his private astronomy," [...] but his cornet, Condon famously quipped, sounded [...] "like a girl saying yes." ...|$|E

500|$|Mars' {{music has}} been noted for {{displaying}} {{a wide variety of}} styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop, rock, reggae, R, soul, and hip hop. His debut album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, a pop record, is influence by these genres. His subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox, as with his debut album, is infused with different influences including dance, rock reggae and soul, as well as balladry. Lyrically, the album is different than the former, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality. The explicit content in the song [...] "Gorilla" [...] caused a controversy in Australia. Many of his songs, particularly on Doo-Wops & Hooligans, reflect [...] "feel-good", carefree, and optimistic sentiments. However, darker subjects are addressed in his songs, detailing failed relationships and self-destructive behaviour. Mars' third album, 24K Magic, is significantly influence by R, soul music and funk. Lyrically, the album involve themes of money and sex. Mars has explained his writing process: [...] "I don't sit down and think, 'I'm going to write a song', inspiration hits me always unexpectedly: on a plane, when I'm out or just before I go to bed. An idea will suddenly come to my mind, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> manage to turn it into lyrics the next day. Sometimes it'll take me one year to get something real out of it. You can’t force creativeness." ...|$|E

2500|$|Glenn Danzig {{has served}} as the sole {{songwriter}} for every band he has fronted, and described his writing process: [...] "Sometimes I get the guitar lines, sometimes I write on the piano, sometimes I’ll write the lyrics first and then figure out the chord patterns on guitar, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> write the drum pattern first. It's all different". Danzig also records basic song ideas when away from his home: [...] "I usually hum it into a microcassette recorder and then I transpose it when I get home and work it out on guitar or piano".|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} at Liverpool, Voronin heavily criticized the {{standard}} of lifestyle in England and Great Britain in general {{and in particular the}} city of Liverpool. Voronin took no prisoners in his rant which criticized the Scouse way of talking, the high crime rate in the city and attacked the country's health care. In April 2008, he stated in a Russian newspaper; [...] "Compared with Germany, England is far behind in terms of comfort and culture. Five out of the seven houses near us are occupied by footballers. Steven Gerrard was burgled recently so a police patrol car comes into our area fairly often. We hear police sirens all the time. Leverkusen by contrast was so much quieter. The medical services here are poor. When I was in Germany, there were lots of good clinics and doctors. It's nothing like that here. when our child had a skin allergy, we waited hours for the doctor to see him. When we finally got to see a doctor, he said he didn't know how to treat children and to try rubbing in this ointment. That was it. I was stunned!. As a result my wife {{had to go back to}} Odessa with him and took a full set of tests there. I study English twice a week with a teacher and I have made some progress in it. But English isn't the main problem. The main thing is to learn to understand the local players like Gerrard and Carragher. They speak with some peculiar local native accent <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> have absolutely no clue what the guys are saying. Many foreign players have the same problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|No Isis album {{contains}} an explicit , or story arc, instead focusing on themes rather than stories. As such, releases {{are defined by}} some as [...] "pseudo-concept albums". The band see lyrics as important, {{but at the same}} time, Turner does not feel it necessary to enunciate every word. Instead, any connections made are mainly conjecture, and the formation of a theme takes into account the album artwork, previous albums, track titles and the use of metaphor just as much as lyricism. Oceanic tells a convoluted tale involving love, incest and suicide by drowning. This relates to the theme of the all-powerful female, present lyrically in every album except Panopticon. Turner does not explicitly acknowledge an [...] "overtly feminine theme"; however, he does state: [...] "I just think it's interesting to include that as part of what we do, simply because metal, especially, is considered to be this very male-oriented, testosterone-driven art form, and I feel like it's important to recognize the other side of our nature. As manly as we might or might not be, we have to acknowledge that there is a feminine part of our persona, and that the world isn't made up of absolutes. To achieve balance, you have to recognize every facet of yourself and everyone else around you." [...] Certain threads do reappear between albums, notes Turner. [...] "There are certain themes which reoccur in my work just because of what I'm interested in and what is aesthetically pleasing for me", he says. [...] "The idea of futuristic utopias and dystopias is probably something that does consciously and subconsciously return time and time again [...] <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> just can't help the fact that these themes creep into my work whether it's conscious or not". The other two ongoing motifs in the lyrics and artwork are that of towers and mosquitos.|$|E

2500|$|Asquith's {{reputation}} {{will always}} be heavily influenced by his downfall {{at the height of}} the First World War. In 1930, Basil Liddell Hart summed up opinion as to the reasons for his fall; [...] "Lloyd George (came to) power as the spokesman for a widespread demand for a more vigorous as well as a more efficient prosecution of the war." [...] Asquith's collegiate approach; his tendency to [...] "wait and see;" [...] his stance as the chairman of the cabinet, rather than leader of a government—"content to preside without directing;" [...] his [...] "contempt for the press, regard(ing) journalists as ignorant, spiteful and unpatriotic;" [...] and his weakness for alcohol—"I had occasion to speak to the P.M. twice yesterday and on both occasions I was nearly gassed by the alcoholic fumes he discharged;" [...] all contributed to a prevailing sense that Asquith was unable to rise to [...] "the necessities of total warfare." [...] Grigg concludes, [...] "In certain vital respects, he was not qualified to run the war. A great head of government in peacetime, by the end of 1916 he was in a general state of decline, his obvious defects as a war leader (exposed)." [...] Cassar, reflecting on Asquith's work to bring a united country to war, and his efforts in the year thereafter, goes towards a reassessment; [...] "His achievements are sufficiently impressive to earn him a place as one of the outstanding figures of the Great War" [...] His contemporary opponent, Lord Birkenhead paid tribute to his bringing Britain united into the War, [...] ""A statesman who rendered great service to his country at a time when no other living Englishman could have done what he did." [...] The Coalition Whip, William Bridgeman, provided an alternative Tory view, comparing Lloyd George to Asquith at the time of the latter's fall; [...] "however unpopular or mistrusted (Lloyd George) was in the House, he carried much more weight in the Country than Asquith, who was almost everywhere looked on as a lazy and dilatory man." [...] Sheffield and Bourne provide a recent historical reassessment; [...] "Asquith's governments arguably took all the key decisions of the War: the decision to intervene, to send the BEF; to raise a mass volunteer army; to start and end the Gallipoli Campaign; the creation of a Coalition government; the mobilisation of industry; the introduction of conscription." [...] But the weight of opinion continues to agree with Asquith's own candid assessment, in a letter written in the midst of war in July 1916; [...] "I am (as usual) encompassed by a cloud of worries, anxieties, problems and the rest. 'The time is out of joint' <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> am tempted to say with Hamlet 'O cursed spite, that ever I was born to set it right.' Perhaps I wasn't." ...|$|E
