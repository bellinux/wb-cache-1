The forewings are grayish-brown above, with {{a clearly}} marked irregular black line {{running from the}} leading to the trailing edge both inwards and outwards of each wing's center. The upperside of the hindwings is mainly yellowish-orange, with a few dark hairs at the base and a blackish pattern. The latter usually forms two roughly concentric bands, an inner one curving through the mid-wing from the leading to the trailing edge, and an outer one that almost reaches the termen. The apex is outside the outer band and forms a large bright orange-yellow spot; likewise, the outer band does not reach the tornus, which bears a separate black spot. The termen has faint dark bands along the wing veins. The underside of the wings is yellow with black bands. Some forms with <b>aberrant</b> <b>pattern</b> are known. As in many relatives, the foreleg tibia of this species possess no spines, while the tarsi carry three rows of spines.|$|E

In 2014 Dr. Mattson published an article entitled “Superior Pattern Processing is the Essence of the Evolved Human Brain” in which he proposed that superior mental processing of patterns is the fundamental basis of all advanced capabilities {{of the human brain}} including intelligence, imagination, invention, language and the belief in imaginary entities such as gods and ghosts. [...] The expansion of the cerebral cortex during human evolution involved mostly brain regions such as the visual association cortex and prefrontal cortex that function to rapidly process visual images and make decisions accordingly. Patterns, be they real or imagined, are reinforced by emotional and social experiences, indoctrination and even psychedelic drugs. The abnormal brain function and behaviors that occur in cognitive and psychiatric disorders result from impaired or <b>aberrant</b> <b>pattern</b> processing. Dr. Mattson’s theory has important implications for understanding human intelligence, creativity and imagination, and for the development of novel approaches for reducing irrational decisions and destructive behaviors that continue to persist in individuals and radical groups throughout the world.|$|E

Thirty-four cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (11 well differentiated, 16 moderately differentiated, 7 poorly differentiated) were studied on frozen sections using monoclonal antisera directed against individual cytokeratins no. 7, 8, 18, and 19 in an immunoperoxidase procedure. In 17 of 34 cases, tumor cells showed only reactivity with monoclonals anticytokeratin no. 8 and 18.

We applied {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) to screen for sequence variations in the coding and splice site consensus sequences of the LDLR gene. For amplification of each exon by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), optimal pairs of primers were designed by the MELT 87 computer algorithm. To increase the sensitivity, an artificial GC-clamp was included in either the 5 '- or the 3 '-end of each fragment. DGGE screening of 32 apparently unrelated heterozygous FH patients revealed 16 unique different <b>aberrant</b> DGGE <b>patterns</b> in 27 patients, while in a group of 32 normal subjects none of these DGGE patterns could be observed, suggesting that the <b>aberrant</b> <b>patterns</b> represent disease-causing mutations.

30|$|Despite {{the above}} limitations, the {{qualitative}} {{findings of this}} review are important. Pelvic posture and kinematics seems to play a relevant role in FAI. The patients, especially if symptomatic, show a paradoxical lack of pelvic back tilt in standing hip flexions, i.e., in squatting, which enhances femoroacetabular engagement. Such an <b>aberrant</b> <b>pattern</b> might depend on a lower PI, but might also depend on insufficient extensor moment exerted by gluteus maximus and/or ischiocrural muscles. On the contrary, active hip flexion in decubitus elicits a compensatory, more pronounced back tilt to facilitate hip flexion without impingement. Level gait seems to be poorly affected, while stair climbing shows a compensatory pattern of augmented pelvic axial rotation and augmented peak forward tilt to reduce the most painful hip motions, namely internal rotation and extension. In other words, pelvic posture and kinematics in FAI are sometimes an expression of compensatory mechanisms, developed to reduce pain and discomfort, and sometimes an expression of paradoxical patterns that further enhance the impingement pathomechanism.|$|E

40|$|Background: Autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) {{has been}} called a ‘developmental disconnection syndrome,’ however the majority of the research examining connectivity in ASD has been conducted exclusively with older children and adults. Yet, prior ASD research suggests that perturbations in neurodevelopmental trajectories begin as early as the first year of life. Prospective longitudinal studies of infants at risk for ASD may provide a window into the emergence of these <b>aberrant</b> <b>patterns</b> of connectivity. The current study employed functional connectivity near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in order to examine the development of intra- and inter-hemispheric functional connectivity in high- and low-risk infants across the first year of life. Methods: NIRS data were collected from 27 infants at high risk for autism (HRA) and 37 low-risk comparison (LRC) infants who contributed a total of 116 data sets at 3 -, 6 -, 9 -, and 12 -months. At each time point, HRA and LRC groups were matched on age, sex, head circumference, and Mullen Scales of Early Learning scores. Regions of interest (ROI) were selected from anterior and posterior locations of each hemisphere. The average time course for each ROI was calculated and correlations for each ROI pair were computed. Differences in functional connectivity were examined in a cross-sectional manner. Results: At 3 -months, HRA infants showed increased overall functional connectivity compared to LRC infants. This was the result of increased connectivity for intra- and inter-hemispheric ROI pairs. No {{significant differences were found between}} HRA and LRC infants at 6 - and 9 -months. However, by 12 -months, HRA infants showed decreased connectivity relative to LRC infants. Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest that atypical functional connectivity may exist within the first year of life in HRA infants, providing support to the growing body of evidence that <b>aberrant</b> <b>patterns</b> of connectivity may be a potential endophenotype for ASD...|$|R

40|$|Protocadherins (Pcdhs) are a {{large family}} of {{adhesion}} molecules which have structure {{similar to that of}} classical cadherins. About 60 Pcdh genes are organized into three clusters (-á,- â and- ã), which are arranged contiguously on a single chromosome in mammals. Mice in which the 22 -gene Pcdh- ã locus has been deleted die within a few hours of birth and show defects in movement and reflexes, extensive neurodegeneration in the spinal cord, and loss of synapses. Further studies have shown that loss of ã-Pcdhs has a primary effect on the formation or maintenance of synapses that can be dissociated from its role in cell survival. Extensive apoptotic cell death observed during the late embryonic development period in the spinal cord of the Pcdh- ã del/del mutant mice is confined to molecularly distinct populations of spinal interneurons. Analysis of cell death patterns during development of spinal cords from wild-type, the Pcdh- ã del/del and Bax -/- mice in which cell death is blocked due to deletion of a proapoptotic protein, confirmed that loss of ã-Pcdhs exacerbates a previously undocumented normal developmental pattern of spinal interneuron apoptosis. Restricted disruption of the Pcdh- ã gene cluster within specific neuronal populations suggested that ã-Pcdhs can control neuronal survival in a non-cell autonomous manner. Loss of ã-Pcdhs also resulted in an <b>aberrant</b> <b>pattern</b> of 1 a proprioceptive sensory afferent (1 aPSA) terminals in the spinal cord. In Pcdh- ã del/del mice the area occupied by 1 aPSA terminals per motor neuron increased by 150 % over the control with a corresponding reduction of 30 % in the area occupied by 1 aPSA terminals on the ventral interneurons. Further analysis in the Pcdh- ã del/del; Bax-/- double mutants, as well as in mouse lines in which Pcdh- ã gene cluster disruption was confined to specific neuronal subpopulations, suggested that this <b>aberrant</b> <b>pattern</b> was a result of both the increased loss of ventral interneurons in mutants, as well as a cell autonomous requirement of ã-Pcdhs in the 1 aPSA and their intermediate target ventral interneurons.
