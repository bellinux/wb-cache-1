5|$|The return match saw Celta Vigo's Jesuli {{level the}} tie on {{aggregate}} after 24 minutes. Celtic rallied, and on 37 minutes John Hartson used his body strength to force {{his way into}} the Spanish penalty box and score with a powerful shot. Crucially, due to the away goals rule, Celta Viga now had to score twice to avoid losing the tie. Benni McCarthy scored early in the second half for Celta Vigo but, despite <b>a</b> <b>glaring</b> miss from Jesuli near the end, Celtic held on to win the tie on away goals. The 1–2 loss on the night was the first of two defeats for Celtic {{on the way to the}} final.|$|E

The religious institutions from government clerics to judges, to religious curricula, and all religious instructions in media {{are restricted to}} the Wahhabi understanding of Islam, adhered to by less than 40% of the population. The Saudi government communized Islam, through its monopoly of both religious thoughts and practice. Wahhabi Islam is imposed and enforced on all Saudis regardless of their religious orientations. The Wahhabi sect does not tolerate other religious or ideological beliefs, Muslim or not. Religious symbols by Muslims, Christians, Jews and other believers are all banned. The Saudi embassy in Washington is a living example of religious apartheid. In its 50 years, {{there has not been}} a single non-Sunni Muslim diplomat in the embassy.

500|$|Neil Perryman of the University of Sunderland feels {{this episode}} {{is a prime}} example of {{transmedia}} storytelling in Doctor Who and Torchwood, describing the episode and ancillary online material released after its airing being in part an attempt at continuity management. He describes [...] "...these metasites have also been used to correct continuity errors that have appeared within the television show. For example, following the broadcast of the Torchwood episode ‘Cyberwoman’ (13 November 2006), the official Torchwood website provided information about ‘The Fall of Torchwood One’ that attempted to correct – via ‘additive comprehension’ – what some fans had regarded as <b>a</b> <b>glaring</b> error in the plot. Fans had asked how the eponymous Cyberwoman was not sucked into the void along with the rest of her kin during the climax to the Doctor Who episode ‘Doomsday’ (8 July 2006) and the site retroactively explained away the problem: ‘The only exceptions were those being converted with material entirely derived from this side of the void’, which allowed the events of ‘Cyberwoman’ to take place without contradicting what viewers originally saw in the episode." ...|$|E

There are some big, thumping fights and a few bright shards of pop-cultural wit, {{but for the most part}} this movie seems content to aim for the generic mean". David Ansen of Newsweek wrote, [...] "Leterrier has style, he's good with action and he's eager to give the audience its money's worth of bone-crunching battles. Still, once the movie leaves the atmospheric Brazilian settings, nothing in this [...] "Hulk" [...] sinks in deeply: its familiar genre pleasures are all on the surface. ... The movie's scene stealer is Tim Blake Nelson, making a comically welcome third act appearance as the unethical but madly enthusiastic scientist Samuel Sterns".|$|E

The Imperial artillery, with twenty pieces arrayed on the Monclin Mound opposite Blake, blasted terrible holes in the Spanish ranks. Major-General Merle led the attack against Blake on the left, reaching west toward the Spanish flank, while Mouton, on the right, put up a noisy demonstration against Cuesta.|$|E

Entering the season, the team considered their special teams <b>a</b> <b>glaring</b> weakness, so they hired a new coach (Joe DeCamillis) and focused on drafting players who could contribute immediately on this unit. The Cowboys started the day without a first-round draft choice (part of the price to acquire Roy Williams) and then traded out of the second round after they couldn't draft center Max Unger, reaching a total of 12 picks, which was their most selections since the 1992 NFL draft. The eventual result was that the team couldn't find a starter in the group and most of the players drafted were waived by the 2010 season.|$|E

2500|$|Young Earth creationists {{generally}} hold that, when Genesis {{describes the}} creation of the Earth occurring over a period of days, this indicates normal-length 24 hour days, and cannot reasonably be interpreted otherwise. They agree that the Hebrew word for [...] "day" [...] (yôm) can refer to either a 24-hour day or a long or unspecified time; but argue that, whenever the latter interpretation is used, it includes a preposition defining the long or unspecified period. In the specific context of Genesis 1, since the days are both numbered and are referred to as [...] "evening and morning", this can mean only normal-length days. Further, they argue that the 24-hour day is the only interpretation that makes sense of the Sabbath command in Exodus 20:8–11. YECs argue that it is <b>a</b> <b>glaring</b> exegetical fallacy to take a meaning from one context (yom referring to {{a long period of time}} in Genesis 1) and apply it to a completely different one (yom referring to normal-length days in Exodus 20).|$|E
2500|$|Many non-originalists, like Justice Byron White, {{have also}} been {{critical}} of substantive due process. As propounded in his dissents in Moore v. East Cleveland and Roe v.

[...] In his book Democracy and Distrust, non-originalist John Hart Ely criticized [...] "substantive due process" [...] as <b>a</b> <b>glaring</b> non sequitur. Ely argued the phrase was both a contradiction in terms, like the phrase green pastel redness, and radically undemocratic by allowing judges to impose substantive values on the political process. Ely argued that the courts should serve to reinforce the democratic process, not to displace the substantive value choices of the people's elected representatives.|$|E
2500|$|The {{summer of}} 2002 did {{not bode well}} for the season ahead. Despite <b>a</b> <b>glaring</b> need for squad reinforcements, only {{positive}} transfer activity involved Irish international Gary Breen signing on a free transfer. Leaving were Paul Kitson and a hatful of youth and fringe players. Another poor start plagued West Ham United through to 2003, and this time Roeder was unable to turn things around. The loss of Kanouté for nearly one-third of the season, and Di Canio at exactly the same period, resulted in the teenage Jermain Defoe leading the line on his own. The loss of form of key players such as Trevor Sinclair, 2001–02 Hammer of the Year Sebastian Schemmel and Michael Carrick, who was still nursing a groin problem, combined with [...] the absence of a dependable left back or left midfielder, merely exacerbated an already difficult situation. The Hammers failed to win a single home game until January and suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Manchester United in the FA Cup. The much-attacked Gary Breen was pointedly at fault for a number of errors, but his play was not helped by the lack of any cohesive team.|$|E
