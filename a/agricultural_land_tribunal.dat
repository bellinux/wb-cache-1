40|$|China's {{urbanization}} {{has resulted}} in significant changes in both <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> and <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> use. However, there is limited understanding {{about the relationship between}} the two primary changes occurring to China's <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> - the urban expansion on <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> and <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> use intensity. The goal of this paper is to understand this relationship in China using panel econometric methods. Our results show that urban expansion is associated with a decline in <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> use intensity. The area of cultivated land per capita, a measurement about land scarcity, is negatively correlated with <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> use intensity. We also find that GDP in the industrial sector negatively affects <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> use intensity. GDP per capita and agricultural investments both positively contribute to the intensification of <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> use. Our results, together with the links between urbanization, <b>agricultural</b> <b>land,</b> and <b>agricultural</b> production imply that <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> expansion is highly likely with continued urban expansion and that pressures on the country's natural land resources will remain high in the future.
