5|$|Almost all of Josquin's motets {{use some}} kind of {{compositional}} constraint on the process; they are not freely composed. Some of them use a cantus firmus as a unifying device; some are canonic; some use a motto which repeats throughout; some use several of these methods. The motets that use canon can be roughly divided into two groups: those in which the canon is plainly designed to be heard and <b>appreciated</b> as such, and another group in which a canon is present, but almost impossible to hear, and seemingly written to be <b>appreciated</b> by the eye, and by connoisseurs.|$|E

5|$|For much of 2009 and 2010, China {{was under}} {{pressure}} from the US to allow the yuan to appreciate. Between June and October 2010, China allowed a 2% appreciation, but there were concerns from Western observers that China only relaxed its intervention when under heavy pressure. The fixed peg was not abandoned until just before the June G20 meeting, after which the yuan <b>appreciated</b> by about 1%, only to devalue slowly again, until further US pressure in September when it again <b>appreciated</b> relatively steeply, just prior to the September US Congressional hearings to discuss measures to force a revaluation.|$|E

5|$|Although Innis remains <b>appreciated</b> and {{respected}} {{for the grand}} and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics.

In this regard, Liszt authority Humphrey Searle suggests {{that he may have}} been closer to his contemporary Hector Berlioz than to many who would follow him in writing symphonic poems.|$|E
