2500|$|Explorer James Bruce, {{who visited}} the Ethiopian Highlands c. 1770, wrote of [...] "a {{tradition}} among the Abyssinians, which {{they say they have}} had since time immemorial", that {{in the days after the}} Deluge, Cush, the son of Ham, traveled with his family up the Nile until they reached the Atbara plain, then still uninhabited, from where they could see the Ethiopian table-land. There they ascended and built Axum, and sometime later returned to the lowland, building Meroë. He also states that European scholars of his own day had summarily rejected this account on grounds of their established theory, that Cush must have arrived in Africa via Arabia and the Bab-el-Mandeb, a strait located between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula, and Djibouti and Eritrea on the Horn of Africa. Further, the great obelisk of Axum was said to have been erected by Cush in order to mark his <b>allotted</b> <b>territory,</b> and his son Ityopp'is was said to have been buried there, according to the Book of Aksum, which Bruce asserts was revered throughout Abyssinia equally with the Kebra Nagast.|$|E

5000|$|In 1699, “...a band of 40 Chacatos on {{a buffalo}} hunt, {{led by a}} Spaniard, {{attacked}} a peaceful Tuskegee trading party, killing 16 and stealing their goods.” [...] This was met with a severe counter by the English and several Native forces; in two separate events in 1702 and 1704, English and Apalachicola forces attacked the Spanish missions, presumably including San Carlos de los Chacatos. Following these attacks in August 1704, 200 Chatos along with an unnumbered amount of Apalachees were found at Mobile Bay with French forces seeking refuge. The following statement, “Juan, chief of the Chato, was <b>allotted</b> <b>territory</b> {{at the mouth of}} the river where he, his mother Jacinta and two hundred of his villagers moved to the site called the Oignonets, location of present-day Mobile” shows that the Chato still held onto some form of their traditions by the start of the 18th century.|$|E

50|$|The Imperial Deputation, {{originally}} {{entrusted with}} the compensation process but now {{reduced to a}} subordinate role, tended {{to be seen by}} the mediating Powers and the key German States as mere constitutional window dressing. This was demonstrated with the Franco-Prussian agreement of 23 May 1802 which, ignoring the Imperial Deputation that has not yet convened, stated that both the King of Prussia and the Prince of Orange-Nassau could take possession of the <b>territories</b> <b>allotted</b> to them immediately after ratification. Two weeks later, the King issued a proclamation listing all the compensation territories awarded to Prussia but he waited until the first week of August 1802 before occupying the bishoprics of Paderborn and Hildesheim and its share of Münster, {{as well as the other}} territories that had been allotted to Prussia. The same month, Bavarian troops entered Bamberg and Würzburg a week after Elector Maximilian IV Joseph had written to their respective prince-bishops to inform them of the imminent occupation of their principalities. During the autumn, Bavaria, Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, and Württemberg, and even Austria, proceeded to occupy the prince-bishoprics, imperial abbeys, and free Imperial cities that had been allotted to them. Formal annexation and the establishment of a civil administration usually followed within a few weeks. Such haste was due in good part to the fear that the June plan might not be definitive and therefore it was thought safer to occupy the <b>allotted</b> <b>territories</b> and place everyone before a fait accompli. That strategy was not foolproof however and Bavaria, which had been in occupation of the bishopric of Eichstätt since September, was forced to evacuate it when the Franco-Austrian convention of 26 December 1802 reallocated most of Eichstätt to the Habsburg compensation package. For their parts, the lesser princes and the counts, with little manpower and resources, generally had to wait until the Final Recess was issued before they could take possession of the territories - if any - that were awarded to them as compensation, usually a secularized abbey or one of the smaller imperial cities.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{reports from}} the European Commission on European Union price {{differentials}} for new motor vehicles reflect a steady narrowing {{of the differences in}} prices for motor vehicles across the 27 Member States. Although the inclusion within the European Community in 2004 of ten new countries with relatively homogeneous pricing has evidently colored these findings, price differentials among the EU- 15 appear to be decreasing. Price convergence has been welcomed by consumer associations and European institutions, which for many years fought arduously to force car manufacturers to reduce these differentials. The justification for their concerns was based on a logical argument. In the 1950 s, European nations initiated a progressive process of integration which ripened over the years into a single market [...] the European Union 2 ̆ 7 s pride and primary objective. Car price differentials questioned the very raison d 2 ̆ 7 être of the emerging Community, as they served to re-enhance national borders, which were becoming progressively blurred by the steady elimination of barriers to trade. The blame was subsequently put on distribution restraints [...] those restrictions contained in distribution agreements between manufacturers and their dealers. Territorial or customer allocation could be used [...] and abused [...] to facilitate price discrimination {{as a consequence of the}} resulting 2 ̆ 2 segmentation 2 ̆ 2 of the market for the product. What is more, according to the Commission these restraints were being utilized to impede consumers from shopping for their cars across national borders and from benefiting from price differences. The Commission responded by penalizing those manufacturers considered to be preventing their dealers from selling to customers outside their <b>allotted</b> <b>territories...</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1180 at the Diet in Gelnhausen, the {{attending}} princes and Frederick I Barbarossa decided to partition Saxony in some dozens of territories of imperial immediacy, <b>allotting</b> each <b>territory</b> {{to that one}} of his allies, who had conquered them before from Henry the Lion and his remaining supporters. Otto I wielded his influence at the Diet. His and Siegfried's brother Bernhard, one of the most steadfast warriors against Henry the Lion, was provided with the later on so-called younger Duchy of Saxony (1180 - 1296), thus becoming Bernhard III, Duke of Saxony. In 1260, with effect from 1296 on, its later rulers split the younger Duchy into the Duchies of Saxe-Wittenberg (Herzogtum Sachsen-Wittenberg) and Saxe-Lauenburg (Herzogtum Sachsen-Lauenburg), the latter belonging in religious respect to the archdiocese of Bremen.|$|R
