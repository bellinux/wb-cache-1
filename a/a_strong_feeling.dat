They were fans of Python, and {{this style of}} humour influenced the lyrics and overall concept. Guitarist Martin Barre recalls the whole band coming up with various ideas for the music. Some parts were recorded in a single take with every member having an input, including significant contributions from keyboardist John Evan.|$|E
5|$|In 1258, Henry faced {{a revolt}} among the English barons. Anger had grown {{about the way}} the King's {{officials}} were raising funds, the influence of the Poitevins at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy; even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King. The Welsh were still in open revolt, and now allied themselves with Scotland. Henry was also critically short of money; although he still had some reserves of gold and silver, they were totally insufficient to cover his potential expenditures, including the campaign for Sicily and his debts to the Papacy. Critics suggested darkly that he had never really intended to join the crusades, and was simply intending to profit from the crusading tithes. To compound the situation, the harvests in England failed. Within Henry's court there was <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>feeling</b> that the King would be unable to lead the country through these problems.|$|E

Within Henry's court there was <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>feeling</b> that the King would be unable to lead the country through these problems. On 30 April, Hugh Bigod marched into Westminster {{in the middle of the}} King's parliament, backed by his co-conspirators, including Simon de Montfort, the Earl of Leicester, and carried out a coup d'état. Henry, fearful that he was about to be arrested and imprisoned, agreed to abandon his policy of personal rule and instead govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen, half chosen by the King and half by the barons.|$|E

25|$|When the Lincoln one-cent coin {{made its}} initial {{appearance}} in 1909, it marked {{a radical departure}} from the accepted styling of United States coinage, as it was the first regular coin to bear a portrait other than the mythical Liberty which appeared on most pre-1909 regular coins. Previously, <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>feeling</b> had prevailed against using portraits on coins in the United States, but public sentiment stemming from the 100th anniversary celebration of Abraham Lincoln's birth proved stronger than the long-standing tradition.|$|E
25|$|Leander Starr Jameson {{made his}} famous raid into the Transvaal on 29 December 1895, and Rhode's {{complicity}} in the action compelled him to resign the premiership of Cape Colony in January 1896.

As Rhode's {{complicity in the}} raid became known, there was <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>feeling</b> of resentment and astonishment among {{his colleagues in the}} Cape ministry who had been ignorant of his connections with such schemes. The Bond and Hofmeyr denounced him particularly strongly, and the Dutch became even more embittered against the English in Cape Colony, which influenced their subsequent attitude towards the Transvaal Boers.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{considerations}} that led the Swedish government to declare Sweden a non-belligerent state was concern that they might otherwise lose control of the internal situation in Sweden. The Soviet demands on Finland in the {{months prior to the}} outbreak of war had roused public opinion. While there had been large demonstrations in support of Finland, Russia was a traditional enemy, and fear of the Russians had {{been a part of the}} Swedish mindset since 1719, when Russian galleys burned Swedish coastal communities during the Great Northern War. Therefore, there was <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>feeling</b> that it was better to defend Sweden on Finnish soil.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the predictive power of occupational stress for teaching style among university faculty members. A sample of 144 faculty members from a large university in the People's Republic of China rated themselves on three ability scales and responded to the Thinking Styles in Teaching Inventory and to four scales from the Occupational Stress Inventory-Revised (role overload, role insufficiency, psychological strain, and rational/cognitive coping). Satisfactory reliability and validity data were obtained for the Chinese version of the four occupational stress scales. After self-rated abilities were taken into account, occupational stress remained a significant predictor of teaching style. <b>A</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>feeling</b> of role overload and more frequent use of a rational/cognitive coping strategy were conducive to employing both creativity-generating and conservative teaching styles; <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>feeling</b> of role insufficiency and psychological strain had a negative impact on the use of creative-generating teaching styles.

With <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>feeling</b> in the country that the parties should compromise, Asquith and other Liberals met with Conservative leaders in a number of conferences through much of the remainder of 1910. These talks failed in November over Conservative insistence that there be no limits on the Lords's ability to veto Irish Home Rule. When the Parliament Bill was submitted to the Lords, they made amendments that were not acceptable to the government.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{relative}} {{youth and}} inexperience, Julius Chambers argued the case, {{because of his}} intimate knowledge of the facts involved. Erwin Griswold, the Solicitor General of the United States, represented the federal government, advocating Nixon’s “go-slow” policy. Though no official vote was taken, Chief Justice Burger and Justice Black wanted to reverse McMillan’s order, while Justices Douglas, Harlan, Brennan and Marshall wanted a strong affirmation of the order; Justices Stewart, White and Blackmun did not express <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>feeling</b> either way. Douglas, Brennan and Marshall were quite liberal, but Harlan was usually conservative. When Burger circulated his very grudging affirmation of McMillan that limited future action and action in other areas by the Court, he met strong resistance. Douglas, Harlan, Brennan and Marshall all demanded revisions and circulated suggestions for alternate drafts. Justice Stewart also reacted strongly after carefully considering {{the facts of the}} case, and wrote a “dissent” {{that would have been the}} opinion of the court without revisions of Burger’s drafts.|$|E

Duncan was at once (21 October) raised to the peerage as Viscount Duncan, of Camperdown, and Baron Duncan, of Lundie in the Shire of Perth (with which came the lands now known as Camperdown Park in Dundee), and there was <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>feeling</b> that the reward was inadequate. Even as early as 18 October his aunt, Lady Mary Duncan, wrote to Henry Dundas, at that time secretary of state for war: Report says my nephew is only made a Viscount. Myself it is nothing, but the whole nation thinks the least you can do is to give him an English earldom. … Am sure were this properly represented to our good king, who esteems a brave, religious man like himself, would be of my opinion. …. It was not, however, till 1831, many years after Duncan's death, that his son, then bearing his title, was raised to the dignity of an earl, and his other children to the rank and precedence of the children of an earl.|$|E

500|$|By 1832 {{the amount}} spent on poor relief nationally {{had risen to}} £7million a year, more than 10shillings per head of population, up from £2million in 1784. The large number of those seeking {{assistance}} was pushing the system to [...] "the verge of collapse". The economic downturn {{following the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century resulted in increasing numbers of unemployed. Coupled with developments in agriculture that meant less labour was needed on the land, along with three successive bad harvests beginning in 1828 and the Swing Riots of 1830, reform was inevitable. Many suspected that the system of poor relief was being widely abused, and in 1832 the government established a Royal Commission to investigate and recommend how relief could best be given to the poor. The result was the establishment of a centralised Poor Law Commission in England and Wales under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, also known as the New Poor Law, which discouraged the allocation of outdoor relief to the able-bodied; [...] "all cases were to be 'offered the house', and nothing else". Individual parishes were formed into Poor Law Unions, each of which was to have a union workhouse. More than500 were built during the next 50years, two-thirds of them by 1840. [...] In certain parts of the country there was a good deal of resistance to these new buildings, some of it violent, particularly in the industrial north. [...] Many workers lost their jobs during the major economic depression of 1837, and there was <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>feeling</b> that what the unemployed needed was not the workhouse but short-term relief to tide them over. By 1838, 573 Poor Law Unions had been formed in England and Wales, incorporating 13,427parishes, {{but it was not until}} 1868 that unions were established across the entire country, the same year that the New Poor Law was applied to the Gilbert Unions.|$|E
