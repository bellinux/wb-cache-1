40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} assess the role of insulin in {{postprandial}} blood pressure regulation in the elderly. Background. Insulin is both a positive inotropic and chronotropic hormone that also vasodilates skeletal muscle vasculature. Insulin may thus mediate aspects of postprandial cardiovascular homeostasis. Methods. Ten healthy elderly subjects were studied in the fasting state on three separate days. After baseline supine hemodynamic and neurohumoral measurements were taken (cardiac output and superior mesenteric artery blood flow were measured using Doppler ultrasound, and calf blood flow was measured using venous occlusion plethysmography), subjects ate on one occasion a 2. 5 -MJ high carbohydrate meal {{and on the other}} two occasions, an isoenergetic high fat meal. One high fat meal was accompanied by an insulin infusion reproducing the plasma insulin profile seen <b>after</b> a <b>high</b> carbohydrate meal while maintaining the glycemic profile seen <b>after</b> a <b>high</b> fat meal alone. After meal ingestion, measurements were repeated every 20 min for 2 h. Results. After the three meals, there were similar increments in cardiac output and heart rate. <b>After</b> the <b>high</b> carbohydrate meal and high fat meal with insulin, mean arterial blood pressure fell by between 8 to 10 mm Hg, but did not change <b>after</b> the <b>high</b> fat meal. <b>After</b> the <b>high</b> carbohydrate meal and the high fat meal with insulin, calf vascular resistance did not change, whereas <b>after</b> the <b>high</b> fat meal, it increased by 15. 5 ± 4. 4 U (mean ± SEM). Conclusions. Insulin contributes to the failure of calf vasoconstriction seen <b>after</b> a <b>high</b> carbohydrate meal. By this vasodepressor action, insulin is at least in part responsible for the fall in blood pressure <b>after</b> a <b>high</b> carbohydrate meal...|$|R

5|$|A low {{pressure}} {{system on the}} tail end of a stationary cold front organized into a subtropical depression on August 8 near the South Carolina coast, and drifted southward. Convection became more organized, and the storm was classified Tropical Depression Three on August 10 over the Bahamas. It executed an anticyclonic loop to the northeast, and was estimated to have attained tropical storm status on August 11, based on reports from Hurricane Hunters. Small cells in the ridge of high pressure caused Arlene to take an unusual track to the east, with two southward jogs in its path. A trough of {{low pressure}} near Bermuda initially inhibited strengthening. However, <b>after</b> <b>high</b> pressures to its east forced the storm northward, more favorable conditions allowed Arlene to intensify into a hurricane on August 22. Operationally, it was upgraded two days earlier, based on the appearance of an eye feature on satellite imagery. After becoming a hurricane, Arlene accelerated to the northeast into the cold waters of the north Atlantic Ocean, and on August 23 it became extratropical about halfway between Newfoundland and Ireland. The extratropical remnants turned to the southeast and later to the east, making landfall on the Iberian Peninsula before dissipating on August 28 over Spain.|$|E
