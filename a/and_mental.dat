40|$|Abstract Background <b>Mental</b> <b>and</b> {{behavioral}} disorders among adults with Usher syndrome {{have been discussed}} and reported in some case studies but no research has been reported on children with Usher syndrome. Methods This article investigates the prevalence <b>and</b> characteristics of <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> {{behavioral disorders}} among 26 children, 3 - 17 years of age, with Usher syndrome. Results Six of the 26 children were diagnosed with a mental or behavioral disorder (1 with schizophrenia <b>and</b> mild <b>mental</b> retardation, 1 with atypical autism <b>and</b> severe <b>mental</b> retardation, 1 with atypical autism <b>and</b> mild <b>mental</b> retardation, 1 with mild <b>mental</b> retardation, <b>and</b> 2 with conduct disorder). Another 3 children had had a mental or behavioral disorder previously in their childhood. Conclusion Even though vision impairment first manifests in late childhood, some children with Usher syndrome seem to develop <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> behavioral disorders during childhood. The aetiology <b>and</b> treatment of <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> behavioral disorders among children with Usher syndrome are discussed. Children with Usher syndrome and their parents may need clinical support during early childhood to prevent development of <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> behavioral disorders. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Child <b>and</b> {{adolescent}} <b>mental</b> {{disorders are}} common, with a substantial disease burden, yet services {{for young people}} are nationally inadequate. As services {{should be based on}} policies and (or) plans, we analyzed the availability and content of child <b>and</b> adolescent <b>mental</b> health policies <b>and</b> plans in all provinces and territories. Method: The World Health Organization (WHO) framework for Child <b>and</b> Adolescent <b>Mental</b> Health Policy <b>and</b> Plans was applied. Results: Four provinces in Canada have a child <b>and</b> adolescent <b>mental</b> health policy <b>and</b> (or) plan. The other provinces do not have a policy or plan in place, or else try to integrate these components into existing mental health strategies. Among the policies and plans that exist, there is substantial variability regarding content as well as degree of adherence to the WHO template. Five essential content areas: legislation and human rights, information systems, quality improvement, improving access to and use of psychotropics, and human resource development and training are poorly or very poorly addressed in existing policies and (or) plans. Conclusion: This lack of specific policy and (or) plans for child <b>and</b> adolescent <b>mental</b> health care <b>and</b> the variability of content in plans that exist may help explain why child <b>and</b> adolescent <b>mental</b> health services are poorly developed across Canada. We suggest that a national child <b>and</b> adolescent <b>mental</b> health policy framework be developed for Canada so that the provinces and territories may be encouraged to create or amend their current child <b>and</b> adolescent <b>mental</b> health frameworks in a manner that may enhance national cohesion and commonly addresses service needs in this population...|$|R
