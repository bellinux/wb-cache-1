5000|$|Still another {{definition}} {{states that}} the thermal equator is the latitude at which insolation is identical throughout the year. This {{is not the same}} as the <b>astronomical</b> <b>equator</b> because the Earth reaches perihelion (the minimum distance from the Sun in its orbit) in early January and is at aphelion (maximum distance) in early July. Therefore, insolation is somewhat higher at 0° latitude in January than in July even though the height of the Sun (at noon) and the length of day (from sunrise to sunset) is essentially the same. At a few degrees north of the equator the perihelion/aphelion factor is balanced by the fact that the angle of the Sun is slightly more direct, and the days are slightly longer, at the time of the summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere (most commonly on June 21), making the level of insolation virtually the same in both [...] "summer" [...] and [...] "winter." ...|$|E
5000|$|The annual {{range of}} monthly mean {{temperatures}} - {{that is to}} say, {{the difference between the}} warmest and coldest months - at Andagoya is mere 0.7 °C (approximately 1.3 °F) as April, the warmest month, has an average temperature of 27.7 °C (81.9 °F) while November, the [...] "coldest" [...] month, averages 27.0 °C (80.6 °F); the average annual temperature is 27.4 °C (81.3 °F). This near complete uniformity of temperature is caused by the fact that Andagoya, at a latitude of 5° 5' North, lies extremely close to the thermal equator, which is situated a few degrees north of the <b>astronomical</b> <b>equator</b> because the Earth reaches perihelion (its closest position to the Sun in its orbit) in early January and is at aphelion (furthest away) in early July, causing places located precisely at the equator to receive somewhat more insolation (i.e., light and heat energy from the sun) in January than in July even though the height of the sun and the length of days would be the same at both times. At a few degrees north latitude, however, the perihelion/aphelion factor and the slightly higher sun and longer days experienced {{at the time of the}} summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere cancel each other out, making the level of insolation experienced there virtually identical throughout the year.|$|E
50|$|It {{consists}} of a circular platform of 177.64 ft (54 m) in diameter which forms a mosaic {{of light and dark}} pebbles drawing an eight-pointed star that indicates the solstices and equinoxes, plus intermediate lines pointing to the cardinal directions. In the center of this platform there is a 10 m (32.80 ft) and 1.30 m (4.27 ft) diameter cylindrical orange tube which serves as a gnomon, pointing to the corresponding hours and months {{of the year in the}} platform according to the shadow cast by the Sun. The ten meter high gnomon represents the metric system, based in the meter which in its beginning was intended to be the result of one ten-millionth of Earth's quadrant. The aim of the color difference between the stones, apart from showing equinox and solstice lines, is to explain the meaning of albedo and its use in <b>astronomical</b> study. The <b>Equator</b> line is drawn by using smaller, darker pebbles between two metal plates.|$|R
