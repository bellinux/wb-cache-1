50|$|The River {{itself was}} always an {{important}} waterway, being navigable to Hertfordshire; the Marsh was formed by the periodic flooding of the river, and so formed useful pasture, but could not be occupied permanently. Before the 10th century, the estuary of the river came as far as Hackney Wick, crossed at Old Ford. Marsh Road, the continuation of Homerton High Street, led to the marshes, and thence to Temple Mills. The Romans appear to have built a significant stone causeway across the marshes here; a periodical, the <b>Ambulator</b> of 1774, noted there have been discovered within {{the last few years}} the remains of a great causeway of stone, which, by the Roman coins found there, would appear to {{have been one of the}} famous highways made by the Romans The river forms a natural boundary, so in 527 AD it formed the boundary between the Saxon kingdoms of Essex and Middlesex. In the 9th century, it formed a part of the Danelaw boundary and reputedly, King Alfred stranded an invading Viking fleet here in 895 AD. This was achieved by draining the river where it met the River Thames, but the increased drainage affected river navigability, until it was restored in the 17th century.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to interpret the outcomes of peak oxygen uptake (VO(2 peak)) in children with SB and explore the relationship between VO(2 peak) and functional ambulation using retrospective cross-sectional study. Twenty-three ambulating children with SB participated at Wilhelmina's Children's Hospital Utrecht, the Netherlands. VO(2 peak) was measured during a graded treadmill-test. Eschenbacher's and Maninna's algorithm was used to determine limiting factors in reaching low VO(2 peak) values. Energy expenditure during locomotion (both O(2) rate and O(2) cost) and percentage of VO(2 peak) and HR(peak) were determined during a 6 -min walking test (6 MWT). Differences between community and normal <b>ambulators</b> were analyzed. VO(2 peak), VO(2 peak) /kg, HR(peak), RER(peak) and VE (peak) were significantly lower compared to reference values, with significant differences between normal and community <b>ambulators.</b> Limiting factors according to the algorithm were mostly "muscular and/or deconditioning" (47 %) and ventilatory "gasexchange" (35 %). Distance walked during 6 MWT was 48. 5 % of predicted distance. Both O(2) rate and O(2) cost were high with significant differences between normal and community <b>ambulators</b> [17. 6 vs. 21. 9 ml/(kg min) and 0. 27 vs 0. 43 ml/(kg m) ]. Also %HR(peak) and %VO(2 peak) were significantly higher in community <b>ambulators</b> when compared to normal <b>ambulators</b> (resp. 97. 6 vs. 75 % and 90. 2 vs. 55. 9 %). VO(2 peak) seems to be mostly limited by deconditioning and/or muscular components and possible ventilatory factors. For both peak values and functional ambulation, community <b>ambulators</b> were significantly more impaired than normal <b>ambulators.</b> High energy expenditure, %VO(2 peak) and %HR(peak) reflect high level of strain during ambulation in the community <b>ambulators.</b> Future exercise testing in children with SB should include assessment of ventilatory reserve.

Participants: Patients with stroke depending on a walking aid in daily life (n= 12; walking aid dependent <b>ambulators)</b> and walking aid independent <b>ambulators</b> (n= 12), all able to walk for at least 5 minutes. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Energy cost (J. kg(- 1). m(- 1)) and temporal gait parameters (walking speed, mean and coefficient of variation of stride time, and symmetry index) were obtained during 4 walking trials at preferred walking speed: overground with and without a cane and on a treadmill with and without handrail support. Results: On the treadmill, handrail support resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} energy cost of 16 %, independent of the group. Although walking aid dependent <b>ambulators</b> had on average a larger reduction in energy cost than walking aid independent <b>ambulators</b> (19 % vs 14 %), this interaction did not reach statistical significance (P=. 11). Interestingly, overground walking with support resulted in an 8 % reduction in energy cost for walking aid dependent <b>ambulators,</b> but a 6 % increase for walking aid independent <b>ambulators.</b> The reduction in energy cost with support was accompanied by changes in temporal gait parameters, most notably an increase in stride time and symmetry and a decrease in stride time variability. Conclusions: Balance support can result in a significant reduction in the energy cost of walking in stroke patients, the magnitude of which depends on walking ability and the walking task. Impaired balance control should not be overlooked as a contributing factor to the increased energy cost of walking in patients with stroke, and improving or assisting balance control should be considered to reduce the energy cost of hemiplegic gait.

40|$|Higginson, Jill S. Every forty seconds {{someone in}} the United States has a stroke, which often leads to long term disability. Eighty percent of post-stroke {{patients}} suffer from hemiparesis, which is characterized by altered lower extremity kinematics during walking. Post-stroke walking performance has been classified based on self-selected walking speed into three groups, household ambulators: 0. 8 m/s. This speed-based classification system stratifies highly variable levels of impairment in post-stroke patients {{and can be used}} to discover hip, knee and ankle functional trends within these groups. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare hip, knee and ankle motion and function for stroke survivors in each ambulatory classification. Through the use of experimental biomechanics, thirty post-stroke patients underwent a gait analysis session in which kinematics and kinetics were recorded. By assessing hip, knee and ankle function and coordination at terminal stance as well as initial swing we investigated differences in function across community ambulation classifications. During terminal stance, household <b>ambulators</b> displayed sagittal plane knee and ankle angle asymmetries between paretic and non-paretic limbs; however, this was not evident for limited community and community <b>ambulators.</b> During initial swing, many asymmetries and distinctions across speed classifications were present with notable knee-dominated coordination patterns for community but not household <b>ambulators.</b> Using musculoskeletal simulation, we found pronounced paretic dorsiflexion and plantar flexion co-contraction for the slowest <b>ambulators,</b> making walking less efficient since muscle actions are working against each other. Increased hip extension moments in household <b>ambulators</b> revealed hip compensation mechanisms to overcome plantar flexor weakness. Favored hamstring contribution to peak hip extension moment was also noted.

METHODS: BMD values were measured in 49 patients (32 females, 17 males; aged 14. 1 [*]±[*] 3. 86 years; range 5 - 20 years) using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and were analyzed based on sex, the level of spinal involvement, vitamin D, and electrolyte values, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), and ambulatory status [patients were divided into three subgroups: full-time wheelchair (FTWC), limited <b>ambulator</b> (LA), and full-time <b>ambulator</b> (FTA) ]. These data were analyzed considering sex-, age-, and BMD-matched values and compared with those of normal population. RESULTS: BMD was significantly lower in these patients compared with that in the general healthy population (Z-score: - 1. 2 [*]±[*] 1. 8); in particular, females had Z-score values significantly lower that of the males (Z-score: - 2. 43 [*]±[*] 2. 02; P[*]<[*] 0. 0004). In FTWC subgroup, Z-score was lower than that of the other two subgroups (P[*]<[*] 0. 009). Vitamin D values were significantly lower compared with those in the general healthy population (vitamin D spina bifida group: 14. 6 [*]±[*] 8. 7 mg/dL; normal subjects: 35 [*]±[*] 9. 8 mg/dL; P[*]<[*] 0. 001).

40|$|Chronic ethanol {{consumption}} {{is associated with}} the development of osteoporosis. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) plays a {{role in the development of}} osteoporosis through stimulation of osteoclastic activity. We hypothesized that ethanol promotes osteoporosis, in part, by increasing IL- 6 production in the bone microenviron-ment. Accordingly, we evaluated ethanol's effect on IL- 6 production in the Saka human bone marrow stromal cell line and in the HOBIT human osteoblast-like cell line. We found that ethanol increased IL- 6 protein levels in the culture supernatants from Saka, but not HOBIT, cells. In addition, we observed that ethanol increased steady-state IL- 6 mRNA levels and activated an IL- 6 promoter-driven reporter vector in Saka cells. We conclude that ethanol stimulates IL- 6 expression in the Saka bone marrow stromal cell line by enhancing transcriptional activity of the IL- 6 gene. Our findings support the contention that ethanol may contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, in part, by increasing IL- 6 expression in the bone microenvironment. OSTEOPOROSIS, an imbalance between bone synthe-sis and bone resorption, represents a highly prevalent, debilitating, and expensive disorder.

Residual deformity including hip flexion contracture more than 30 °, knee flexion contracture more than 30 °, scoliosis, hip dysplasia or dislocation, knee extension contracture or recurvatum, active motion of hips and knees and upper limb involvement were evaluated. Statistical analysis was done to evaluate factors that were statistically significant to affect walking ability in AMC patients. Results: At the latest followup, 31 patients were community <b>ambulators,</b> 3 patients were household <b>ambulators,</b> 3 patients were nonfunctional ambulatory, and 14 patients were nonambulatory. There were an average of 4. 3 surgeries per patient. Statistical analysis of all factors was done and the results were significant with a P 30 degrees with odds ratio of 4. 58. Hip flexion contracture > 30 ° was a trend toward significant with a P value of 0. 058 and odds ratio of 4. 53. Multivariate analysis showed that knee flexion contracture was significant with 4. 58 (95 % CI 1. 01 - 20. 6). Conclusion: AMC is a rare disease that causes disability, requiring multiple surgeries to correct deformities. Our study showed that residual knee flexion contracture was associated with nonambulatory status of patients with AMC...|$|R
