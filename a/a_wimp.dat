40|$|We {{investigate}} the signatures of antimatter in cosmic rays {{that would result}} from annihilations of the scalar dark matter candidate of the Inert Doublet Model. We consider three benchmark candidates, all consistent with the WMAP cosmic abundance and existing direct detection experiments, and confront the predictions of the model with the recent PAMELA, ATIC and HESS data. For <b>a</b> light IDM <b>WIMP</b> candidate, MDM = 10 GeV, we argue that the positron and antiproton uxes are large, but consistent with expected backgrounds, unless there is an enhancement in the local density of dark matter. For <b>an</b> IDM <b>WIMP</b> candidate with MDM = 70 GeV, the contribution {{is lower than the}} expected backgrounds unless there is a large boost factor. However, the candidate is enable to explain the excesses observed by the recent experiments. Finally, for <b>an</b> IDM <b>WIMP</b> candidate with MDM = 10 TeV, it is possible to t the PAMELA excess, while satisfying the anti-protons data, but, unfortunately, not the ATIC one. ...|$|R
