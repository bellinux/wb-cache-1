5|$|Allenby's {{plan was}} to avoid {{fighting}} in or near Jerusalem but to cut all road access to the city <b>and</b> <b>force</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Army to evacuate it. He ordered two infantry divisions; the 52nd (Lowland) (Major General J. Hill) and the 75th Division (Major General P. C. Palin), and two mounted divisions; the Yeomanry and the Australian Mounted Divisions to begin the advance. They were to move eastwards from Latron, which had been captured on 16 November, {{in the same direction}} as the Jaffa to Jerusalem road.|$|E
5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel <b>and</b> <b>force</b> <b>the</b> damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of containment inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|He {{adopted a}} plan to capture a hill where republican guns could {{dominate}} the city's harbour <b>and</b> <b>force</b> <b>the</b> British to evacuate. The assault on the position led to the capture of the city, but during it Bonaparte {{was wounded in the}} thigh. He was promoted to brigadier general at the age of 24.

5|$|The {{plan to take}} Bapaume {{involved}} the 1st Infantry Brigade, positioned at Grévillers, moving {{to the south of}} Bapaume with the 63rd Division moving forward to protect the right flank of the New Zealanders. Meanwhile, the 2nd Infantry Brigade would move {{to the north of the}} town. Its left flank would be protected by the 37th Division. Their aim was to envelop Bapaume <b>and</b> <b>force</b> <b>the</b> Germans to abandon the town and thus avoid costly street to street fighting.|$|E
5|$|To his surprise, Wellesley {{found the}} entire {{combined}} army before him. Nevertheless, he resolved to attack at once, believing {{that if he}} waited for Stevenson, the Marathas would {{have the chance to}} slip away <b>and</b> <b>force</b> <b>the</b> pursuit to drag on. Wellesley was also eager to forge a reputation for himself, and despite his numerical disadvantage, he was confident that the Maratha’s irregular forces would be swept aside by his disciplined troops, and only Scindia’s regular infantry could be expected to stand and fight.|$|E

5|$|Cully and his thugs arrive as the McCoys try to leave. A violent gunfight ensues in the halls, stairwell, and {{elevator}}; all Cully's men {{are killed}} but one, who Doc allows to run away. Cully himself dies when Doc shoots the cables {{of the elevator}} he is in and it crashes {{to the bottom of}} the shaft. Rudy comes to his senses, follows Doc and Carol outside onto a fire escape, and shoots at them. Doc returns fire and kills him. With the police on the way, the couple hijack a pickup truck <b>and</b> <b>force</b> <b>the</b> driver, a cooperative old cowboy, to take them to Mexico. After crossing the border, Doc and Carol pay the cowboy $30,000 for his truck. Overjoyed, the cowboy heads back to El Paso on foot, while the couple continue into Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Despite his bluster, Kutuzov {{knew from}} dispatches that his army {{had been too}} badly hurt to fight a {{continuing}} action the following day. He {{knew exactly what he}} was doing: by fighting the pitched battle, he could now retreat with the Russian army still intact, lead its recovery, <b>and</b> <b>force</b> <b>the</b> weakened French forces to move even further from their bases of supply. The dénouement became a textbook example of what a hold logistics placed upon an army far from its center of supply. On September8, the Russian army moved away from the battlefield in twin columns to Semolino, allowing Napoleon to occupy Moscow and await for 5 weeks a Russian surrender that would never come.|$|E
5|$|Fremantle also {{despatched}} several officers, including Hoste, {{to operate}} independently. Hoste in Bacchante returned to Apulia and attacked {{a string of}} ports, castles and anchorages, while Captain George Cadogan in HMS Havannah effectively halted the movement of supplies along the northern Italian coast {{in support of the}} approaching Austrian armies. In June, Fremantle himself led his whole squadron against the important port city of Fiume, seizing or burning 90 vessels from the harbour and huge quantities of naval stores after a sharp battle in the city streets. Three months later, Fremantle attacked the city of Trieste, blockading it from the sea, bombarding its defences and landing marines and cannon to join with the besieging Austrian armies <b>and</b> <b>force</b> <b>the</b> city's surrender.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Buckley {{wrote that}} by 1 July, {{there was a}} {{stalemate}} in which the British were established south of the Odon but had retired from Hill 112, in {{what may have been}} a premature decision. The Germans had maintained a continuous front but only by using reserves which made it impossible to begin the counter-offensive planned by , which made the offensive a considerable Allied success, as part of a strategy of attrition based on organised fire power. Looked on as an attempt to break through <b>and</b> <b>force</b> <b>the</b> Germans out of Caen the operation failed but in terms of Montgomery's strategy it was a costly victory. The German defence of Normandy never recovered from the damage inflicted during Epsom, the initiative was lost and German counter-attack tactics failed in the face of Allied fire power, with even greater cost than that inflicted on the British; the German command structure and assumptions on which the defence was based were undermined.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} autumn of 1808, the French Navy {{despatched}} four large frigates to the East Indies. These ships, stationed on Île de France and Île Bonaparte, {{were ordered to}} attack and disrupt British trade routes from the Far East, in particular British India. This disruption was intended to have a negative financial effect on the British economy <b>and</b> <b>force</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy to send ships into the Indian Ocean, expending valuable resources in doing so. The commander of this French force was Commodore Jacques Hamelin, a highly skilled officer who ordered his frigates to disperse in the Bay of Bengal to hunt British East Indiamen, large and well armed merchant ships that carried millions of pounds worth of goods between Britain and her Empire ever year.|$|E

Just before they leave, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) boards the bus with him in an attempt to impress his ex-girlfriend Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper). Both get cold feet 45 minutes into the trip, <b>and</b> <b>force</b> <b>the</b> bus to stop. They then have Erin drive them home.|$|E

5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, two of the crew are trapped on the Romulan drone ship while Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) on the Enterprise attempts to gain the co-operation of the Andorians and Tellarites in tracking down the drone. His plan is complicated when Commander Shran (Jeffrey Combs) challenges a Tellarite to a duel, causing Archer to step in.

5|$|The Japanese combat air patrol, flying Mitsubishi A6M2 Zeros, made short {{work of the}} unescorted, slow, under-armed TBDs. A few TBDs {{managed to}} get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before {{dropping}} their torpedoes—close {{enough to be able}} to strafe the enemy ships <b>and</b> <b>force</b> <b>the</b> Japanese carriers to make sharp evasive maneuvers—but all of their torpedoes either missed or failed to explode. Remarkably, senior Navy and Bureau of Ordnance officers never questioned why half a dozen torpedoes, released so close to the Japanese carriers, produced no results. The abysmal performance of American torpedoes in the early months of the war became a scandal. Torpedo after torpedo either missed by running directly under the target, prematurely exploded, or struck targets with textbook right angle hits (sometimes with an audible clang) and failed to explode.|$|E
5|$|The Malayan Emergency was {{a guerrilla}} {{war between the}} Federation of Malaya—a {{protectorate}} of Britain until August 1957, {{and part of the}} Commonwealth of Nations thereafter—and the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), the armed wing of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). The MNLA sought to topple the Malayan government <b>and</b> <b>force</b> <b>the</b> British out, while the Commonwealth worked to prevent this. The conflict had its roots in the Second World War, in which groups of local ethnic Chinese fought alongside Britain's limited forces in the country against the occupying Imperial Japanese; these Malayan Chinese subscribed to communist political thinking, and called themselves the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army.|$|E

5|$|The Russian {{garrison}} on Corfu, augmented with {{a powerful}} naval squadron, effectively blocked French use of the Adriatic by sealing the entrance through the Straits of Otranto. French military concerns were also directed further north at this time, resulting in the War of the Fourth Coalition during 1806 and 1807 that saw Napoleon's armies overrun Prussia <b>and</b> <b>force</b> <b>the</b> Russians to sign the Treaty of Tilsit on July 7, 1807. One of the minor clauses of this treaty transferred the Septinsular Republic back into French hands, the Russians withdrawing completely from the Adriatic. This withdrawal supported a hidden clause in the treaty that guaranteed French support in the continuing Russian war with the Ottomans in the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|The raid had an {{unforeseen}} consequence, {{when the}} commander of Île Bonaparte General Nicolas Des Bruslys, committed suicide rather than lead the garrison against the British landing parties. This encouraged Rowley to consider a larger operation to seize the whole island.

5|$|The {{town had}} descended into {{lawlessness}} {{with a number}} of saloons, brothels, dancing halls, and widespread gambling. The town had no law enforcement officers, and the local government officials had become bar keepers. Governor West had extended prohibition laws, but they were widely ignored in Copperfield. Some local residents had appealed to the state government for assistance. Over half the residents of the town had signed a petition, addressed to West, alleging that saloons owned by the mayor and City Council members were selling liquor to minors and staying open later than their posted hours. Governor West responded by ordering county officials to restore order, close the saloons, <b>and</b> <b>force</b> <b>the</b> resignations of the corrupt city leaders by December 25, 1913.|$|E
