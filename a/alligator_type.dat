50|$|The <b>Alligator</b> <b>type</b> {{crossheads}} {{were split}} on the vertical centre line and clamped on {{to the end of}} the piston rods, which had three coned rings engaging in grooves in the crossheads. The original coupling rods differed from the usual in being three separate rods, thereby doing away with four knuckle joints and pins.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinders}} and frames {{were cast}} {{in one piece}} while the steel cylinders and steam chests were fitted with cast iron liners. The tender frame was also a one-piece steel casting. The <b>Alligator</b> <b>type</b> crossheads were split on the vertical centre line and clamped on {{to the end of}} the piston rods, which had three coned rings engaging in grooves in the crossheads. The original coupling rods differed from the usual in the provision of three independent rods, thereby doing away with four knuckle joints and pins.|$|E

Its waters contain interesting creatures like amphibians, turtles, snakes, <b>alligators,</b> and many <b>types</b> of fish, including bowfin, alligator gar, and catfish.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{wildlife}} {{of the park}} are gray squirrels, otter, turtles, <b>alligators</b> and many <b>types</b> of birds. Among the birds are songbirds, hummingbirds, red-shoulder hawks, and swallowtail kites, as well as osprey, barred owls, and various water birds. There is a 2 mi nature trail.|$|R
500|$|Alligator drum: <b>Alligator</b> drums were <b>type</b> {{of drums}} once used in Neolithic China, made from clay and {{alligator}} hides. They {{have been found}} over a broad area at the Neolithic sites from modern Shandong in the east to Qinghai in the west, dating to a period of 5500â€“2350 BC. In literary records, drums manifested shamanistic characteristics and were often used in ritual ceremonies. Drums covered with alligator skin for ceremonial use are mentioned in the Shijing.|$|R
5000|$|Wildlife {{that can}} be found within the river itself include manatees, <b>alligators,</b> and various <b>types</b> of fish. Since Manatee River Estuary is widely used for {{commercial}} fishing many regulations apply. Everything from fin fish and invertebrates to bait and food shrimp are harvested for commercial fishing, therefore, many commercial fishing regulations apply. [...] As the name would suggest, there are also many manatees found within the river. These mammals prefer warm water so they move throughout the river towards the warmest areas depending on the season.|$|R

This paper based on Beamlet algorithm using MATLAB software {{to process the}} pavement crack images and classify the different cracks into four types: horizontal, vertical, <b>alligator,</b> and block <b>types.</b> Experiment {{results show that the}} proposed method can effectively detect and classify of the pavement cracks with a high success rate, in which transverse crack and longitudinal crack detection rate reach to 100 %, and alligator crack and block crack reach more than 85 %...|$|R
25|$|Feathers and {{scales are}} made up of two {{distinct}} forms of keratin, and it was long thought that each type of keratin was exclusive to each skin structure (feathers and scales). However, a study published in 2006 confirmed the presence of feather keratin {{in the early stages of}} development of American <b>alligator</b> scales. This <b>type</b> of keratin, previously thought to be specific to feathers, is suppressed during embryological development of the alligator and so is not present in the scales of mature alligators. The presence of this homologous keratin in both birds and crocodilians indicates that it was inherited from a common ancestor. This may suggest that crocodilian scales, bird and dinosaur feathers, and pterosaur pycnofibres are all developmental expressions of the same primitive archosaur skin structures; suggesting that feathers and pycnofibers could be homologous.|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the application of Asphalt-Rubber in cold climates was undertaken to dispel the misconception that Asphalt-Rubber only works in hot, dry climates. This survey was conducted on Stress Absorbent Membranes (SAMs) and Stress Absorbent Membrane interlayers (SAMls). Climatic regions {{included in this study}} are dry cold, wet cold and frequent freeze thaw. All Asphalt-Rubber projects were placed before 1983, the majority are more than 10 years old. Freeze index for these projects range from 500 to 4, 500 degree days, with annual rainfall from 1 5 to 60 inches per-year. The survey revealed early problems with the loss of cover aggregate, which improved as bar distribution, application rates and type of aggregates used, were modified. In spite of aggregate loss, Asphalt-Rubber sealed and stopped crack reflection of <b>alligator</b> or block <b>type</b> cracks. Without crack preparation with Asphalt-Rubber or other methods, Asphalt-Rubber as a membrane alone in SAMs and SAMls have not been effective in stopping transverse cracking in cold climates...|$|R
40|$|An {{effective}} {{pavement management}} system (PMS) {{is one that}} is guided by a software program that ensures that all pavement sections are maintained at adequately high serviceability levels and structural conditions with a low budget and resource usage, without causing any significant negative effect on environment, safe traffic operations and social activities. PMS comprises of section classification; performance prediction; and optimisation for decision-making. For section classification, this research presents a fuzzy inference system (FIS), with appropriate membership functions for section classifications and for calculating the pavement condition index (PCI). The severity and extent of seven distress <b>types</b> (<b>alligator</b> cracking, block cracking, longitudinal and transverse cracking, patching, potholes, bleeding and ravelling) were used as fuzzy inputs. The result showed a good correlation for fuzzy model. A sensitivity analysis showed a pavement crack has the greatest influence on section classification compared to the other distress types. A novel network level deterministic deterioration model was developed for flexible pavement on arterial and collector roads in four climatic zones considering the impact of maintenance, age, area and length of cracks, and traffic loading. The prediction models showed good accuracy with high determination coefficient (R 2). The cross-validation study showed that the models for arterial roads yield better accuracy than the models for collector roads. A sensitivity analysis showed that the area and length of cracks have the most significant impact on the model performance. A novel discrete barebones multi-objective particle swarm algorithm was applied for a discrete multi-objective problem. Conventional particle swarm optimisation (PSO) techniques require a manual selection of various control parameters for the velocity term. In contrast, the bare-bones PSO has the advantage of being velocity-free, hence, does not involve any parameter selection. The discrete barebones multi-objective PSO algorithm was applied to find optimal rehabilitation scheduling considering the two objectives of the minimisation of the total pavement rehabilitation cost and the minimisation of the sum of all residual PCI values. The results showed that the optimal maintenance plan found by the novel algorithm is the better than found by conventional algorithm. Although the results of performance metrics showed that the both algorithms perform on a par, the novel algorithm is clearly advantageous as it does not need parameter selection...|$|R
