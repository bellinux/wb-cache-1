5|$|<b>A</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> {{agriculture}} is wheat rust, a pathogenic fungus causing reddish patches, coloured by its spores. A virulent {{form of the}} wheat disease, stem rust, strain Ug99, spread from Africa across to the Arabian Peninsula by 2007. In field trials in Kenya, more than 85% of wheat samples, including major cultivars, were susceptible, implying that higher crop diversity was required. The Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug argued for action to ensure global food security.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example is}} the city of Berkeley, California. The tree {{protection}} ordinance prohibits the removal of coast live oak trees and any excessive pruning that can cause harm to the tree is also prohibited. The only exception is if the tree is poses <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> life or limb and danger to the property.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in terms}} of fan base, the two fan bases are close in a way. Although the general public has held a {{stereotype}} of heavy metal fans being suicidal, depressed and <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> themselves and society in general. However, Adrian North, a Heriot-Watt University professor who studies genre listeners found that metal listeners were above all else creative, at ease with themselves and introverted — qualities he also found in classical listeners.|$|E

5|$|Himmler began {{developing}} {{the notion of}} a Germanic religion and wanted SS members to leave the church. In early 1936, Heydrich left the Catholic Church. His wife, Lina, had already done so the year before. Heydrich not only felt he could no longer be a member, but came to consider the church's political power and influence <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> the state.|$|E
5|$|However, {{with the}} {{increase}} in paved roads and the increasing size of cities, snow-paving fell out of favour, as the resultant slippery surfaces posed <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> pedestrians and traffic. The earliest patents for snowplows date back to 1840, but there are no records of their actual use until 1862, when the city of Milwaukee began operating horse-drawn carts fitted with snowplows. The horse-drawn snowplow quickly spread to other cities, especially those in areas prone to heavy snowfall.|$|E
5|$|Managing {{to right}} himself, he became faint from the {{escaping}} gas and lashed {{himself to the}} ropes to prevent a fall. Realising the attempt was now <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> himself and the balloon, L'Estrange set out the grappling hooks to catch onto something and bring the balloon down. However the ropes had become tangled and the hooks were too short.|$|E

5|$|The New Harbour {{was later}} renamed as Keppel Harbour in 1900 after Admiral Sir Henry Keppel of HMS Meander, {{who carried out}} an on-site survey to build an {{anchorage}} in the harbour in the 1880s. He was also known for his successful campaigns against the pirates in 1842 that were boldly harassing merchant ships {{in close proximity to}} the harbour. Piracy became less of <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> the trade of Singapore only from the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|The {{father of}} Oswald Cobblepot and husband of Esther Cobblepot. He {{and his wife}} {{abandoned}} their son by throwing him into Gotham City's park river after realizing {{that he could be}} <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> society after he killed their cat. Burgess Meredith, the actor who played The Penguin in the 1960s Batman TV series was originally asked to play Tucker, but he declined due his health problems which culminated with his death in 1997.|$|E
5|$|This slow-moving but {{aggressive}} fish dominates feeding frenzies, and is <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> shipwreck or air crash survivors. Recent {{studies show}} steeply declining populations because its large fins are highly valued {{as the chief}} ingredient of shark fin soup, and as with other shark species, the whitetip faces mounting fishing pressure throughout its range.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1945, the ACLU {{had taken a}} stand {{to protect the rights}} of the mentally ill, when it drafted a model statute {{governing}} mental commitments. In the 1960s, the ACLU opposed involuntary commitments, unless it could be demonstrated that the person was <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> himself or the community. In the landmark 1975 O'Connor v. Donaldson decision the ACLU represented a non-violent mental health patient who had been confined against his will for 15 years, and persuaded the Supreme Court to rule such involuntary confinements illegal. The ACLU has also defended the rights of mentally ill individuals who are not dangerous, but who create disturbances. The New York chapter of the ACLU defended Billie Boggs, a mentally ill woman who exposed herself and defecated and urinated in public.|$|E
5|$|As {{it entered}} Cleveland County, the National Weather Service and Storm Prediction Center {{activated}} emergency procedures, preparing to evacuate staff and others {{present at the}} facility {{in the event that}} the supercell should turn right, placing areas surrounding the Norman campus in the tornado's path (under NOAA protocol in situations posing <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> personnel at local Weather Forecast Offices and related guidance centers, responsibility over the issuance of warnings and statements on the unfolding outbreak would have been transferred to the nearest NWS Forecast Office, based in Tulsa, while the SPC's forecasting responsibilities would {{be turned over to the}} 557th Weather Wing at Offutt Air Force Base). The supercell, however, continued on a northeastward track, sparing the Norman area.|$|E
5|$|By January 1943, Himmler {{reported}} that 629,000 ethnic Germans had been resettled; however, most resettled Germans {{did not live}} in the envisioned small farms, but in temporary camps or quarters in towns. Half a million residents of the annexed Polish territories, {{as well as from}} Slovenia, Alsace, Lorraine, and Luxembourg were deported to the General Government or sent to Germany as slave labour. Himmler instructed that the German nation should view all foreign workers brought to Germany as <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> their German blood. In accordance with German racial laws, sexual relations between Germans and foreigners were forbidden as Rassenschande (race defilement).|$|E

50|$|When {{a person}} is acting in a disorderly manner, the act allows the police to take someone already in custody to a {{designated}} psychiatric facility for examination by a physician if {{they believe that the}} person is <b>an</b> immediate <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> himself or herself, <b>an</b> immediate <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> others, or not able to care for himself or herself to an extent that physical impairment will result. The officer must believe, implicitly, that the immediate nature of the threat precludes the use of section 16 (Bringing Information before a Justice of the peace).|$|R
5|$|Five years later, {{the three}} cadet {{graduates}} are positioned in Trost District, {{one of the}} border towns jutting out of Wall Rose when the Titans attack again. In the ensuing battle, Eren saves Armin from being eaten by a bearded Titan, {{at the cost of}} him being eaten himself. A Titan later appears and begins fighting the other Titans while ignoring humans; the Titan is revealed to be Eren, who has developed the ability to transform into one. Though he is seen as a threat by some, he helps the military take back Trost District. After being placed on trial for being <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> the humans, he is taken in by the Survey Corps' Special Operations Squad, led by Captain Levi.|$|E
5|$|Her {{relationship}} with the Jesuits was complex. Members of this order educated her, served as her confessors, and supervised the religious education of her eldest son. The Jesuits were powerful and influential {{in the early years}} of Maria Theresa's reign. However, the queen's ministers convinced her that the order posed <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> her monarchical authority. Not without much hesitation and regret, she issued a decree which removed them from all the institutions of the monarchy, and carried it out thoroughly. She forbade the publication of Pope Clement XIII's bull which was in favour of the Jesuits and promptly confiscated their property when Pope Clement XIV suppressed the order.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, Volvo Cars and Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, {{issued a}} report {{regarding}} {{the results of the}} first phase of the Volvo V70 Plug-in Hybrid demonstration program. Among other findings, before the trial drivers participating in the field testing were concerned about being <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> pedestrians and cyclists due to the quietness of the electric-drive vehicle. After the test several of them change their opinion and said that this issue was less of a problem than expected. Nevertheless, some test drivers said they experienced incidents of not being noticed while others said they had taken extra care in their driving with regard to this issue.|$|E
