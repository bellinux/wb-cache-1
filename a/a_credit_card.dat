Online, riders may purchase passes for a month ($28) or a year ($85 if paid in one lump; $96 if paid in monthly increments of $8); these riders are mailed an RFID key that can unlock bikes without a code.|$|E

5|$|Two {{months after}} its release in August 2001, Funcom began {{offering}} free trial subscriptions, now common practice for other {{games in the}} MMOG genre.

After their trial period, players could either cancel their accounts, or keep them to continue playing the game at the cost of the monthly subscription fee.|$|E
5|$|Orr {{became an}} agent {{representing}} hockey players in 1996. Along with investors, Orr purchased the Woolf Associates agency founded by Boston lawyer Bob Woolf. To prevent conflicts of interest, Orr sold {{an investment in}} the Lowell Lock Monsters minor pro hockey team and cut his ties with <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> firm that had {{a contract with the}} NHLPA. Orr became a certified agent, although he would not be negotiating with hockey clubs. Player agent Rick Curran merged his agency with Orr's in 2000. Curran and Orr along with partner Paul Krepelka incorporated the agency as Orr Hockey Group in February 2002.|$|E
5|$|Privacy Control can warn users when sending {{confidential}} information. It {{can also}} be configured to block the transmission. It allows users to specify how the information can sent, such as via IM or e-mail. Item-specific exceptions allow users to control where there data can be sent. However, PC Pro found a flaw in the information filtering feature. The way information is formatted {{on the list of}} confidential information can affect its effectiveness. For example, entering the last six digits of <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> number will not stop the numbers from leaking if they are grouped in four digits. PC Magazine also noted the fact anyone who can login to the computer can view the database of private information. For that reason, Symantec recommends entering only the last portion of sensitive information.|$|E

5|$|The {{first series}} of Spooks saw various storylines {{involving}} the main characters. Among these were Danny's obsession {{with money and}} spending, by hacking into <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> database to fool it {{to give him a}} better credit rating, and the discovery that Tessa is running phantom agents to pocket their money. Those storylines were intended by Brenton and Wolstencroft to show the audience that the MI5 officers are tempted by money. A principle story arc is Tom dealing with the complexities of his relationship with Ellie, who at first does not know he is a spy. This storyline was based on Mike Baker, whose wife did not know he was a spy {{for the first six months}} they were together. As the series progressed, there were more difficulties with the relationship; Brenton wrote Tom's position as if the character did not see the problem. The same episode also introduced the sexual tension between Danny and Zoe.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} re-released in 1985 and 2002, earning another $60 million and $68 million respectively, for a {{worldwide}} total of $792 million with North America accounting for $435 million. It held the global record {{until it was}} surpassed by Jurassic Park—another Spielberg-directed film—in 1993, although it managed {{to hold on to}} the domestic record for a further four years, where a Star Wars reissue reclaimed it. It was eventually released on VHS and laserdisc on October 27, 1988; to combat piracy, the tapeguards and tape hubs on the videocassettes were colored green, the tape itself was affixed with a small, holographic sticker of the 1963 Universal logo (much like the holograms on <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card),</b> and encoded with Macrovision. In North America alone, VHS sales came to $75 million. In 1991, Sears began selling E.T. videocassettes exclusively at their stores as part of a holiday promotion. It was reissued on VHS and Laserdisc again in 1996. The Laserdisc included a 90-minute documentary. Produced and directed by Laurent Bouzereau, it included interviews with Spielberg, producer Kathleen Kennedy, composer John Williams and other cast and crew members. It also included two theatrical trailers, an isolated music score, deleted scenes, and still galleries. The VHS included a 10-minute version of the same documentary from the Laserdisc.|$|E
5|$|With Max Capricorn dead, the Heavenly Host divert to {{the next}} highest authority, the Doctor, and aid him in quickly {{reaching}} the bridge. Together with Midshipman Frame, he uses {{the heat from the}} entry into the Earth's atmosphere to restart the ship's auxiliary engines. The ship stabilises and narrowly avoids a collision with Buckingham Palace. The Doctor then realizes that Astrid was wearing a teleport bracelet when she fell into the engine. In an emergency, the teleport bracelets were programmed to hold a person's molecular pattern in stasis until it can be recovered. The Doctor frantically attempts to retrieve Astrid's pattern, but the machine is too badly damaged. The Doctor reluctantly allows the ghostly remains of Astrid's atoms to dissipate into space. As the surviving passengers wait for rescue, the Doctor and Mr. Copper, who would otherwise be sent to prison for committing fraud {{in order to get a}} job with the company, teleport to Earth and find that the TARDIS has landed unharmed in an snowy field, thrown from the ship after the collision. Mr. Copper is left to live on Earth with <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> preloaded with £1,000,000, thanks to the Doctor.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> is {{different}} from a charge card, where it requires the balance to be repaid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged. <b>A</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> also differs from a cash card, {{which can be used}} like currency by the owner of the card. <b>A</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> differs from a charge card also in that <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Due to a rapid {{advancement}} {{in the electronic}} commerce technology, the use of <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> has dramatically increased. <b>As</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>card</b> becomes the most popular mode of payment for both online as well as regular purchase cases of fraud associated with it are also raising.

If <b>an</b> Incoming <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> transaction is not accepted by the trained HMM with sufficiently high probability, it is considered to be fraudulent.
