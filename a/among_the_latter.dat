5|$|Russel {{estimated}} the Egyptian village population to be 3.3 million in 2,300 villages, a high density for rural {{populations in the}} time period. He attributes it to the high productivity of Egyptian soil which allowed for increased agricultural growth. The urban population was much lower, 233,100, consisting of 5.7% of the total Egyptian population. The largest cities were Cairo (pop.60,000), Alexandria (pop.30,000), Qus (pop.25,000), Damietta (pop.18,000), Fayyum (pop.13,000), and Bilbeis (pop.10,000). Numerous smaller cities dotted the Nile River. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> were Damanhur, Asyut, and Tanta. Cities in Egypt were also densely populated, mainly because of greater urbanization and industrialization than elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Johnston's {{forces were}} forced to {{withdraw}} from Bowling Green in February 1862. During the retreat, Breckinridge {{was put in charge}} of Johnston's Reserve Corps. Johnston decided to attack Ulysses S. Grant's forces at Shiloh, Tennessee on April 6, 1862 by advancing North from his base in Corinth, Mississippi. Breckinridge's reserves soon joined the Battle of Shiloh as Johnston tried to force Grant's troops into the river. Despite Johnston being killed in the fighting, the Confederates made steady progress against Grant's troops until P. G. T. Beauregard – who assumed command after Johnston's death – ordered his generals to break off the fighting at about 6 o'clock in the afternoon. The next day, the Union forces regrouped and repelled the Confederates. Of the 7,000 troops under Breckinridge's command at the battle, 386 were killed and 1,628 were wounded, Breckinridge <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter.</b>|$|E
