5|$|The average yearly {{survival}} rate of emperor penguins has been measured at 95.1%, with an <b>average</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of 19.9years. The same researchers estimated that 1% of emperor penguins hatched could feasibly reach {{an age of}} 50years. In contrast, only 19% of chicks survive {{their first year of}} life. Therefore, 80% of the emperor penguin population comprises adults five years and older.|$|E
5|$|A fairly {{comprehensive}} demographic {{study was}} done by historian John Demos for his seminal 1970 work on the Pilgrims A Little Commonwealth. He reports that the colony's average household grew from 7.8 children per family for first-generation families to 8.6 children for second-generation families, and to 9.3 for third-generation families. Child mortality also decreased over this time, with 7.2 children born to first-generation families living until their 21st birthday. That number increased to 7.9 children by the third generation. Life expectancy was higher for men than for women. Of the men who survived {{until the age of}} 21, the <b>average</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> was 69.2 years. Over 55 percent of these men lived past 70; less than 15 percent died before the age of 50. For women, the numbers are much lower, owing to the difficulties inherent in childbearing. The <b>average</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of women at the age of 21 was only 62.4 years. Of these women, less than 45 percent lived past 70, and about 30 percent died before the age of 50.|$|E

5|$|About 0.3–0.7% {{of people}} are {{affected}} by schizophrenia during their lifetimes. In 2013 there were an estimated 23.6 million cases globally. Males are more often affected than females. About 20% of people do well and a few recover completely. Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness are common. The <b>average</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of people with the disorder is ten to twenty-five years less than for the general population. This {{is the result of}} increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate (about 5%). In 2015 an estimated 17,000 people worldwide died from behavior related to, or caused by, schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{densities of}} this waxwing are {{typically}} {{low compared to}} other passerines, usually less than ten birds per square kilometre (26per square mile) even in good habitat, although up to 35·6birds per square kilometre (92per square mile) {{have been found in}} Russia. One brood each year is normal. Maximum recorded ages are 5years 10months in North America and more than 13years 6months in Europe. The <b>average</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> is unknown.

5|$|Following work by {{the breed}} clubs to ensure that any reoccurring health {{problems}} are dealt with, there are no especially common conditions affecting the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. However, minor problems affecting the breed can include hypothyroidism, primary closed angle glaucoma and Cushing's syndrome. In order to combat glaucoma in the breed, the breed clubs recommend that Dandies should have a procedure called a gonioscopy performed on them at regular intervals throughout their lives. The Dandie is also at slightly higher risk of canine cancer than average. The <b>average</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of a Dandie Dinmont Terrier is 1113 years.|$|E

5|$|One major {{manifestation of}} the North–South divide is in health and <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> statistics. All three Northern England {{statistical}} regions have lower than <b>average</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancies</b> and higher than average rates of cancer, circulatory disease and respiratory disease. Blackpool has the lowest <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> at birth in England – male <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> at birth between 2012 and 2014 was 74.7, against an England-wide average of 79.5 – {{and the majority of}} English districts in the bottom 50 were in the North East or the North West. However, regional differences do seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991–1993 and 2012–2014, <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years, the fastest increase in any region outside London, and the gap between <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> in the North East and South East is now 2.5 years, down from 2.9 in 1993.|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} {{department responsible for}} the NHS is the Department of Health, headed by the Secretary of State for Health, who sits in the British Cabinet. Most of the expenditure of the Department of Health is spent on the NHS—£98.6billion was spent in 2008–2009. In recent years the private sector has been increasingly used to provide more NHS services despite opposition by doctors and trade unions. The <b>average</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of people in England is 77.5 years for males and 81.7 years for females, the highest of the four countries of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), also {{referred}} to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It {{is the cause of}} 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the <b>average</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> following diagnosis is three to nine years.|$|E

40|$|Life in zoological gardens {{provides}} {{a number of}} benefits to captive animals, resulting in an artificial reduction of the “struggle for life” compared to their free-ranging counterparts. These advantages should result in a higher chance of surviving {{from one year to}} the next, and thus in longer <b>average</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancies</b> for captive animals, given that the biological requirements of the species are adequately met. Here, we compare the <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of captive and free-ranging populations of three deer species (reindeer Rangifer tarandus, red deer Cervus elaphus, and roe deer Capreolus capreolus). Whereas captive reindeer and red deer had <b>life</b> <b>expectancies</b> equal to or longer than free-ranging individuals, the <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of captive roe deer was shorter than that of free-ranging animals. These results support the impression that roe deer are difficult to keep in zoos, whereas reindeer and red deer perform well under human care. We suggest that the mean <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of captive populations relative to that of corresponding free-ranging populations is a reliable indicator to evaluate the husbandry success of a species in captivity...|$|R

5|$|Bulgaria has a {{universal}} healthcare system financed by taxes and contributions. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) pays a gradually increasing {{portion of the}} costs of primary healthcare. Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4.1 percent of GDP. The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100,000 people, but distribution by fields of practice is uneven, there is a severe shortage of nurses and other medical personnel, and the quality of most medical facilities is poor. Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in neighboring countries. Bulgaria ranks 121st globally by <b>average</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy,</b> which stands at 74.5 years for both genders. The primary causes of death are similar to those in other industrialised countries, mainly cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms and respiratory diseases.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} eastern European countries, Belarus has a {{negative}} population growth rate and a negative natural growth rate. In 2007, Belarus's population declined by 0.41% and its fertility rate was 1.22, well below the replacement rate. Its net migration rate is +0.38 per 1,000, indicating that Belarus experiences slightly more immigration than emigration. , 69.9% of Belarus's population is aged 14 to 64; 15.5% is under 14, and 14.6% is 65 or older. Its population is also aging; {{the median age of}} 30–34 is estimated to rise to between 60 and 64 in 2050. There are about 0.87 males per female in Belarus. The <b>average</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> is 72.15 (66.53 years for men and 78.1 years for women). Over 99% of Belarusians aged 15 and older are literate.|$|E
5|$|M. nigrocincta is a gamergate species, {{which allows}} female workers to be fertile, {{and these are}} then able to {{reproduce}} in both queenless and queenright (colonies with a queen) colonies. This means a colony which loses its queen can still thrive {{in the absence of}} the queen. In laboratory colonies of M. nigrocincta where there was no queen present, worker-laid eggs were reared to mature males, showing that workers are highly fertile. The <b>average</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of an adult worker M. nigrocincta ant is 1.1 to 1.2 years, with a maximum expectancy of 1.3 years (400 or more days).

40|$|The {{dramatic}} increase in the world 2 ̆ 7 s population that has occurred over the past 100 years has come largely through reductions in death due to infectious disease. An epidemiologic transition to a preponderance of deaths due to degenerative conditions such as cardiovascular disease and cancer is occurring in the developing countries {{as well as in the}} industrialized ones. In the industrialized countries, demographic profiles now reflect the increased <b>life</b> <b>expectancies</b> of both sexes. However, female <b>life</b> <b>expectancies</b> exceed male by six or more years. Further change in mortality patterns will accompany success in the reduction of the number of mortalities attributable to such degenerative conditions as cardiovascular disease and cancer. In the 21 st century, conditions associated with senescence will be of increasing concern. Adaptive strategies that enhanced reproductive success throughout most of human evolution may now prove detrimental to human health as <b>average</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancies</b> reach unprecedented length. In this environment, differences in the survival mechanisms deployed by males as opposed to females will become increasingly important...|$|R

5|$|Because the kakapo is long-lived, with an <b>average</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of 58years and {{the maximum}} at about 90 years, {{it tends to}} have an {{adolescence}} before it starts breeding. Males start booming at about 5years of age. It was thought that females reached sexual maturity at 9 years of age, but this idea was debunked in the 2008 breeding season when two 6-year-old females named Apirama and Rakiura laid eggs. Generally females do not seek out males until they are between 9 and 11 years old. The kakapo does not breed every year and {{has one of the}} lowest rates of reproduction among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply. Rimu mast occurs only every three to five years, so in rimu-dominant forests such as those on Codfish Island, kakapo breeding occurs as infrequently.|$|E
