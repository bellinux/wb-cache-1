5|$|In 2003, {{under the}} code name Project 28, the Indian Navy placed {{an order for}} four ASW corvettes. The corvette's design was {{originally}} planned {{to be based on}} the Russian corvette Project 2038.2, however the basic design was later provided by the Indian Navy's Directorate of Naval Design, followed by the detailed design by GRSE. The design includes many stealth ship features, including reductions in <b>acoustic</b> <b>signature</b> and vibration of the vessels.|$|E
5|$|The engines power an 18.59metre {{diameter}} five-bladed main rotor. The {{rotor blades}} are constructed from carbon/glass with nomex honeycomb and rohacell foam, edged with titanium alloy in a sandwich construction. The shaping {{of the main}} rotor blades {{is derived from the}} BERP rotor blades first used on the Westland Lynx. This blade design improves aerodynamic efficiency at the blade tip and reduces the <b>acoustic</b> <b>signature.</b> Improved BERP IV rotors have since been developed; when installed, this increases the AW101's maximum takeoff weight.|$|E
5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>signature</b> of the rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} recent propagation {{studies conducted}} at Gulfstream Aerospace for <b>acoustic</b> <b>signatures</b> propagated from quiet supersonic jets in steady, level flight. Data {{presented in this}} paper includes how atmospheric variability influences the propagation of <b>acoustic</b> <b>signatures</b> whose shaping features were achieved due to the Gulfstream Quiet SpikeTM. Two different vehicle configurations were propagated through a wide variety of non-standard atmospheric conditions. Results from that study show that Gulfstream shaped signatures exhibit seasonal and geographic variations in loudness levels between 4 to 10 dB with most of the loudness variation being quieter than the level for the standard atmosphere. Additionally, this paper provides estimates for the number of these quiet <b>acoustic</b> <b>signatures</b> per day that might occur on the continental U. S. if supersonic business jets were permitted to operate over populated areas. Estimates for the number of occurrences show that most of the continental United States would be exposed to two or less <b>acoustic</b> <b>signatures</b> per day from the primary acoustic carpet.

40|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>signatures</b> {{are common}} {{components}} of avian vocalizations and {{are important for}} the recognition of individuals and groups. The proximate mechanisms by which these signatures develop are poorly understood, however. The development of <b>acoustic</b> <b>signatures</b> in nestling birds is of particular interest, because high rates of extra-pair paternity or egg dumping can cause nestlings to be unrelated {{to at least one}} of the adults that are caring for them. In such cases, nestlings might conceal their genetic origins, by developing <b>acoustic</b> <b>signatures</b> through environmental rather than genetic mechanisms. In a cross-fostering experiment with tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor, we investigated whether brood signatures of nestlings that were about to fledge were attributable to their genetic/maternal origins or to their rearing environment. We found that the calls of cross-fostered nestlings did not vary based on their genetic/maternal origin, but did show some variation based on their rearing environment. Control nestlings that were not swapped, however, showed stronger brood signatures than either experimental group, suggesting that <b>acoustic</b> <b>signatures</b> develop through an interaction between rearing environment and genetic/maternal effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{mechanical}} devices which lack the real-time readiness assessment and performance monitoring capability required for future space missions is studied. The {{results of a}} test program to establish the feasibility of implementing structure borne acoustics, a nondestructive test technique, are described. The program included the monitoring of operational <b>acoustic</b> <b>signatures</b> of five separate mechanical components, each possessing distinct sound characteristics. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>signatures</b> were established for normal operation of each component. Critical failure modes were then inserted into the test components, and faulted <b>acoustic</b> <b>signatures</b> obtained. Predominant features of the sound signature were related back to operational events occurring within the components both for normal and failure mode operations. All of these steps can be automated. The structure borne acoustics technique lends itself to reducing checkout time, simplifying maintenance procedures, and reducing manual involvement in the checkout, operation, maintenance, and fault diagnosis of mechanical systems...|$|R
5|$|The F-22 was {{designed}} to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions, infrared signature and <b>acoustic</b> <b>signature</b> as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} interactive object categorization that couples exploratory behaviors and their resulting <b>acoustic</b> <b>signatures</b> to form object categories. The framework was tested with an upper-torso humanoid robot on a container/non-container categorization task. The robot used six exploratory behaviors (drop block, grasp, move, shake, flip, and drop object) and applied them to twenty objects. The results from this large-scale experimental study show that the robot was able to learn meaningful object categories using only acoustic information. The results also show {{that the quality of}} the categorization depends on the exploratory behavior used to derive it as some behaviors elicit more salient <b>acoustic</b> <b>signatures</b> than others.

2500|$|In 2003, Barbar {{was asked}} {{to return to a}} LARES {{installation}} he had just left, the Sunset Center in Carmel, California, as its new <b>acoustic</b> <b>signature</b> was perceived as being too long and too detailed. Bruno Weil, conductor of the Carmel Bach Festival, had requested Barbar to emulate within the Sunset Center the acoustics of a large church. Formerly characterized as having [...] "sponge-like acoustics", the Sunset Center's LARES-enhanced acoustics made coughs and rustlings from the audience be heard too loudly on stage, and reverberation in the audience area was likened to [...] "the Grand Canyon" [...] by one observer. The City of Carmel paid US$10,000 for Barbar's extra ten days of tuning the system. With the assistance of Carmel Bach Festival management, the system was re-tuned with favorable results. Music critic Scott MacClelland wrote: [...] "The search for the optimal acoustic in the Sunset auditorium continues. A controversial electronic enhancement system was built into the renovation – to compensate for some inherent shortcomings of the room — and was freshly tweaked by its designer before this year’s festival began. (It was even further adjusted between the opening Saturday night program and the Sunday matinee under review.) Most of the undesirable artifacts of the original tuning are now gone, and the sonic imagery today may be as good as it gets." ...|$|E
