5|$|Augustus Owsley Stanley I (May 21, 1867 – August 12, 1958) was an American {{politician}} {{from the}} US state of Kentucky. A Democrat, {{he served as}} the 38th Governor of Kentucky and also represented the state in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. From 1903 to 1915, Stanley represented Kentucky's 2nd congressional district in the House of Representatives, where he gained {{a reputation as a}} progressive reformer. Beginning in 1904, he called for an <b>antitrust</b> investigation of the American Tobacco Company, claiming they were a monopsony that drove down prices for the tobacco farmers of his district. As a result of his investigation, the Supreme Court of the United States broke up the American Tobacco Company in 1911. Stanley also chaired a committee that conducted an <b>antitrust</b> investigation of U.S. Steel, which brought him national acclaim. Many of his ideas were incorporated into the Clayton <b>Antitrust</b> Act.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, former Oakland Raider Gene Upshaw {{became the}} {{executive}} director of the NFLPA. During his tenure, he oversaw a player strike, several <b>antitrust</b> lawsuits, and the collective bargaining agreement of 1993.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Apple {{settled out}} of court both an <b>antitrust</b> lawsuit and a related class-action suit {{regarding}} cold calling employees of other companies.|$|E
5|$|November 15, 2011: The NBA {{canceled}} all games through December 15. Players filed <b>antitrust</b> {{lawsuits against}} the NBA in California and Minnesota federal courts.|$|E
5|$|The few {{courts that}} have {{considered}} the <b>antitrust</b> implications of concurrent use registration have determined {{that it does not}} raise any violation of <b>antitrust</b> laws. Although it is considered a violation of such laws for companies to agree to divide up geographic territories for the sale of goods, concurrent use agreements dividing up trademark territories are specifically provided for by Congress. Furthermore, even with such an agreement in place, a company can still sell competing products in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in office, Ross {{proposed}} tax reform laws intended to provide for more equitable assessments of propertyat that time, people were allowed to assess their own belongings with little oversight. The legislature passed his recommendations, and approved his plan to exert more control over school funds and to require local taxation to support the public schools. He also encouraged the legislature to enact <b>antitrust</b> laws. These were passed March 30, 1889, a full year before the federal government enacted the Sherman <b>Antitrust</b> Act. His reform acts were beneficial for the state, leading Ross to become the only Texas governor to call a special session of the legislature {{to deal with a}} treasury surplus.|$|E
5|$|However, Paramount {{vetoed the}} plan {{almost out of}} hand due to <b>antitrust</b> concerns. A few months earlier, the FCC had ruled that Paramount {{controlled}} DuMont, and there were still some questions about whether UPT had really separated from Paramount.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Danny Gardella, who {{had left}} the New York Giants for the Mexican League in 1946, filed suit against Major League Baseball, {{claiming}} Chandler's ban on players {{who went to the}} Mexican League had denied him a means of pursuing his livelihood. Gardella demanded $100,000 in damages from the suspension, and claimed that the award should be tripled because baseball was subject to federal <b>antitrust</b> laws. Similar suits were filed by Max Lanier and Fred Martin, both of whom also played in Mexico. On June 2, 1949, a federal court refused to reinstate the three players pending their trials, but urged that the <b>antitrust</b> issues be adjudicated as soon as possible. Attempting to alleviate the legal pressure on Major League Baseball, Chandler lifted the bans on players who had gone to Mexico, reinstating them almost two years early. Lanier and Martin dropped their suits, but Gardella pursued his. After Gardella's lawyer publicly questioned Chandler in court about baseball's <b>antitrust</b> exemption for {{a day and a half}} in September 1949, baseball executives, including Chandler, agreed to settle Gardella's case for $60,000.|$|E
5|$|President Roosevelt sought {{re-authorization}} of NIRA on February 20, 1935. But {{the backlash}} against the New Deal, coupled with continuing congressional concern over the Act's suspension of <b>antitrust</b> law, left the President's request politically dead. By May 1935, the issue was moot as the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled Title I of NIRA unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|Robertson {{was also}} an {{integral}} part of Robertson v. National Basketball Ass'n of 1970. The landmark NBA <b>antitrust</b> suit, named after the then-president of the NBA Players' Association, led to an extensive reform of the league's strict free agency and draft rules and, subsequently, to higher salaries for all players.|$|E
5|$|Taft sent {{a special}} message to Congress {{on the need}} for a revamped <b>antitrust</b> statute when it convened its regular session in December 1911, but it took no action. Another <b>antitrust</b> case that had {{political}} repercussions for Taft was that brought against the International Harvester Company, the large manufacturer of farm equipment, in early 1912. As Roosevelt's administration had investigated International Harvester, but had taken no action (a decision Taft had supported), the suit became caught up in Roosevelt's challenge for the Republican presidential nomination. Supporters of Taft alleged that Roosevelt had acted improperly; the former president blasted Taft for waiting three and a half years, and until he was under challenge, to reverse a decision he had supported.|$|E
5|$|The players {{ultimately}} prevailed after a {{jury trial}} on their claims. That verdict, the pendency of other <b>antitrust</b> cases {{and the threat of}} a class action lawsuit filed by Reggie White, then with the Philadelphia Eagles, on behalf of all NFL players caused the parties to settle the <b>antitrust</b> cases and to agree on a formula that permitted free agency. In return, the owners received a salary cap, albeit one tied to a formula based on the players' share of total league revenues. The agreement also established a salary floorminimum payrolls all teams were obliged to pay. The settlement was presented to and approved by Judge Doty, who had also heard the McNeil <b>antitrust</b> case in 1993. Once the agreement was approved, the NFLPA reconstituted itself as a labor union and entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the league. The NFLPA and the league extended the 1993 agreement five times. The final extension came in March 2006 when it was extended through the 2010 season after the NFL owners voted 302 to accept the NFLPA's final proposal.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s to the present, Apple {{has been}} {{plaintiff}} or defendant in civil {{actions in the}} United States and other countries. Some of these actions have determined significant case law for the information technology industry and many have {{captured the attention of}} the public and media. Apple's litigation generally involves intellectual property disputes, but the company has also been a party in lawsuits that include <b>antitrust</b> claims, consumer actions, commercial unfair trade practice suits, defamation claims, and corporate espionage, among other matters.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{willingness}} of the players to cross the picket lines and networks to broadcast the replacement games, despite a 20% drop in television viewership and even steeper drops in attendance, the union failed to achieve their demands. The strike ended on October 15, 1987, without a collective bargaining agreement in place. The union filed a new <b>antitrust</b> lawsuit on December 30 asking federal judge David Doty to overturn the league's restricting free agent policies.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the United States Football League {{formed as}} a spring league, and enjoyed {{moderate}} success during its first two seasons behind such stars as Jim Kelly and Herschel Walker. In 1985, the league, which lost {{a considerable amount of}} money due to overspending on players, opted to gamble on moving its schedule to fall in 1986 and filing a billion-dollar <b>antitrust</b> lawsuit against the NFL in an effort to stay afloat. When the lawsuit only drew a three-dollar judgment, the USFL folded.|$|E
5|$|In Radovich v. National Football League, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Radovich's favor and {{declared}} the NFL {{was subject to}} <b>antitrust</b> laws, and the implication was that {{the legality of the}} draft and reserve clause were dubious. Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from <b>antitrust</b> regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business. He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling. The House Judiciary committee, chaired by Emanuel Celler—who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision. Red Grange and Bell testified at the committee's solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport's success. Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, and it seemed as if Congress was going to accept their position. Faced with Congressional opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives.|$|E
5|$|In two 1960s {{decisions}} collectively {{known as}} forming the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, the Court {{established that the}} right to petition prohibited the application of <b>antitrust</b> law to statements made by private entities before public bodies: a monopolist may freely go before the city council and encourage the denial of its competitor's building permit without being subject to Sherman Act liability.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian Economic Commission {{operates}} a competition policy to ensure equal competitive {{conditions in the}} commodity markets of the Single Economic Space. It also aims at harmonisation and improvement of legislation {{of each of the}} three countries in regard to competition policy. The commission serves as the competition regulator for the single market and is also responsible for <b>antitrust</b> issues. Special regulations limit state intervention in the economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill had}} a more {{difficult}} time in the Senate. The National Association of Manufacturers, Chamber of Commerce, and industrialist Henry Ford all opposed its passage. Senator Bennett Champ Clark introduced an amendment to emasculate Section 7(a), but Wagner and Senator George W. Norris led the successful opposition to the change. The bulk of the Senate debate, however, turned on the bill's suspension of <b>antitrust</b> law. Senators William E. Borah, Burton K. Wheeler, and Hugo Black opposed any relaxation of the Sherman <b>Antitrust</b> Act, arguing that this would exacerbate existing severe economic inequality and concentrate wealth {{in the hands of}} the rich (a severe problem which many economists at the time believed was one of the causes of the Great Depression). Wagner defended the bill, arguing that the bill's promotion of codes of fair trade practices would help create progressive standards for wages, hours, and working conditions, and eliminate sweatshops and child labor. The Senate passed the amended legislation 57-to-24 on June 9.|$|E
5|$|The union {{rejected}} the offer on November 9 {{and asked for}} another bargaining session. The two sides met again as the deadline passed. After two days of negotiation, the owners put forth a revised final offer {{and said that they}} were done bargaining. If accepted by the players, Stern hoped to start a 72-game season in mid December. On November 14, the union {{rejected the}} last offer and dissolved the union. The NBPA was converted into a trade association, enabling the players as individual employees to participate in a class action <b>antitrust</b> lawsuit against the league, calling the lockout an illegal group boycott. Attorney David Boies, who represented the NFL owners in their 2011 lockout, agreed to represent the players and join Keesler, who also represented the players in the NFL lockout. On November 15, one group of NBA players (including Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups, Kawhi Leonard, and Leon Powe) filed an <b>antitrust</b> lawsuit against the NBA in a California federal court, while another (including Anthony Tolliver, Ben Gordon, Caron Butler and Derrick Williams) filed their own suit against the NBA in a Minnesota federal court. November 15 was also the day players were to receive their first paychecks if the season was played.|$|E
5|$|Willson's {{interventions}} ultimately {{had little}} to do with the end of the violence. In 1908, the courts began handing down convictions against the Night Riders, though many of their leaders escaped the convictions. A 1909 measure sponsored by Kentucky representative Augustus O. Stanley removed a national tax on tobacco, and in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found the American Tobacco Company to be in violation of <b>antitrust</b> laws. Each of these events helped raise tobacco prices, pacifying the violent farmers.|$|E
5|$|A Republican, Harrison {{was elected}} to the {{presidency}} in 1888, defeating the Democratic incumbent, Grover Cleveland. Hallmarks of Harrison's administration included unprecedented economic legislation, including the McKinley Tariff, which imposed historic protective trade rates, and the Sherman <b>Antitrust</b> Act. Harrison also facilitated the creation of the national forest reserves through an amendment to the Land Revision Act of 1891. During his administration six western states were admitted to the Union. In addition, Harrison substantially strengthened and modernized the U.S. Navy and conducted an active foreign policy, but his proposals to secure federal education funding as well as voting rights enforcement for African Americans were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|As {{professional}} football {{became a national}} television phenomenon, college football did as well. In the 1950s, Notre Dame, which had a large national following, formed its own network to broadcast its games, {{but by and large}} the sport still retained a mostly regional following. In 1952, the NCAA claimed all television broadcasting rights for the games of its member institutions, and it alone negotiated television rights. This situation continued until 1984, when several schools brought a suit under the Sherman <b>Antitrust</b> Act; the Supreme Court ruled against the NCAA and schools are now free to negotiate their own television deals. ABC Sports began broadcasting a national Game of the Week in 1966, bringing key matchups and rivalries to a national audience for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Breyer {{served as}} a law clerk to Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg during the 1964 term (list), and served briefly as a fact-checker for the Warren Commission. He was a special {{assistant}} to the United States Assistant Attorney General for <b>Antitrust</b> from 1965 to 1967 and an assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force in 1973. Breyer was a special counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary from 1974 to 1975 and served as chief counsel of the committee from 1979 to 1980. He worked closely with the chairman of the committee, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, to pass the Airline Deregulation Act that closed the Civil Aeronautics Board.|$|E
5|$|Historian Lowell H. Harrison called Stanley's {{administration}} {{the apex}} of the Progressive Era in Kentucky. The most significant legislation passed during the 1916 legislative session were a state <b>antitrust</b> law and a ban on railroads offering free passes to public figures. A Corrupt Practices Act required candidates for office to file reports of their expenses, limited the amount of allowable expenses, and forbade public service corporations from contributing to any campaign. Other accomplishments included initiating the state's first budget program, enacting its first workman's compensation law, and instituting a convict labor law. The one progressive measure that did not pass, a bill granting women's suffrage, failed in the House by a single vote.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Apple {{agreed to}} cut the price UK {{consumers}} pay to download music for their iPods after a formal complaint to the European Commission from the UK consumer group Which? demonstrated higher prices in UK for the same iTunes songs sold elsewhere in the European Union (EU). The Commission began an <b>antitrust</b> investigation in 2007 of Apple's business practices after the complaint was made, but ultimately the Commission probe found no agreements between Apple and major record labels on how iTunes is run in Europe, only that Apple had been paying higher wholesale prices to UK music labels and was passing the cost along to UK customers.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, after {{temporarily}} {{losing its}} Fox affiliation for WFFT-TV to a subchannel of WISE-TV {{due to a}} reverse compensation dispute, Nexstar (ironically, given its use of similar practices in other markets) filed an <b>antitrust</b> lawsuit against the station's managing partner, Granite Broadcasting, arguing that it had built a monopoly on local advertising sales by having effective control of the outlets for five major networks (ABC and MyNetworkTV on WPTA, and NBC, Fox, and The CW on WISE-TV; owned by Malara Broadcast Group and operated under agreements by Granite). The lawsuit was settled in February 2013 via mutual agreement, after which the Fox affiliation was given back to WFFT.|$|E
5|$|In August 1992, Greyhound {{canceled}} its {{bus terminal}} license (BTL) agreements with other carriers at 200 terminals, and imposed {{the requirement that}} Greyhound be the sole-seller of the tenant's bus tickets within a 25-mile radius of such a Greyhound terminal. In 1995, The United States Department of Justice <b>Antitrust</b> Division brought suit to stop this practice, alleging {{that it was an}} illegal restraint of trade, bad for consumers, and reduced competition. In February 1996, the United States won its case, and Greyhound agreed to permit its tenants to sell tickets nearby and permit its tenants to honor interline tickets with competitors.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Scott Armstrong {{attempted}} to convince Edward Bennett Williams, then {{the owner of}} the Baltimore Orioles, to play a game of Cuban All-Stars against his Orioles. Williams declined, as he had a position on an advisory board in the Reagan Administration, which opposed having any business with Cuba. Armstrong discussed the idea with MLB Commissioner Bart Giamatti and MLB Players Association (MLBPA) chair Donald Fehr. Though Giamatti was interested, he died before he could pursue the idea. Fehr visited Cuba during the 1994-95 MLB strike, but could not secure an <b>antitrust</b> exemption.|$|E
5|$|In the June 2009 {{legislative}} elections, Kirchner {{was defeated}} by Francisco de Narváez of the Union PRO coalition for National Deputy of Buenos Aires Province. The Front for Victory was defeated in the Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Córdoba, and the Kirchners lost the Congressional majority. Voter disenchantment with the Kirchners was caused by inflation, crime and the previous year's agricultural conflict, which cost them rural support. The Kirchners pushed a media law through during the Congress' lame-duck session. The Kirchners described it as an <b>antitrust</b> law to limit media ownership, but critics considered instead that {{it was used to}} reduce the freedom of the press.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{not invited}} to {{participate}} in the presidential debates because he did not meet the criteria of 15% support in five polls set by the Commission on Presidential Debates. In 2015, Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein filed a lawsuit against the commission, arguing that the commission and its rules violated <b>antitrust</b> law and the First Amendment. In August 2016, the lawsuit was dismissed. Johnson's poll numbers have been averaging between 7 and 9 percent. Johnson's campaign manager Ron Nielson argued for Johnson's inclusion, citing Ross Perot's admission to the debates in the 1992 debates, when Perot was polling at 8 percent.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{both parties}} were {{concerned}} {{with the growth of}} the power of trusts and monopolies, {{and one of the first}} acts of the 51st Congress was to pass the Sherman <b>Antitrust</b> Act, sponsored by Senator John Sherman of Ohio. The Act passed by wide margins in both houses, and Harrison signed it into law. The Sherman Act was the first Federal act of its kind, and marked a new use of federal government power. While Harrison approved of the law and its intent, his administration was not particularly vigorous in enforcing it. However, the government successfully concluded a case during Harrison's time in office (against a Tennessee coal company), and had initiated several other cases against trusts.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February, several {{news outlets}} {{reported}} that JAL would decide {{to keep its}} alliance with American Airlines and end talks with Delta. Inamori and ETIC officials, according to the reports, decided that switching alliances from Oneworld to Skyteam would be too risky and could hinder JAL's ability to turn around quickly. Two days later, JAL officially announced that they would strengthen their partnership with American, including a joint application for <b>antitrust</b> immunity on transpacific routes. The airline would also fortify its relationship with other partners in the Oneworld alliance.|$|E
5|$|The committee's {{investigation}} {{lasted from}} May 1911 to April 1912. At its conclusion, the committee split along party lines. Stanley authored the majority report which condemned alleged price fixing by U.S. Steel and censured President Theodore Roosevelt {{for his role}} in U.S. Steel's purchase of the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company. The minority report, authored by Republican Augustus P. Gardner, absolved Roosevelt and downplayed the price fixing charges. Stanley's report also recommended a number of changes to strengthen the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Though his recommendations were not enacted into law during his time in the House, many of them were eventually included in the Clayton <b>Antitrust</b> Act.|$|E
5|$|The {{permissive}} attitude toward business {{did not always}} extend toward large corporations. A lack of venture capital in the state became a significant problem with the early industry. Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from outside the state {{would lead to a}} loss of political power, revenue, and business opportunities. This sentiment led to a series of <b>antitrust</b> lawsuits by the state Attorney General starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to gain control of the state oil companies.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{ascent to}} the presidency, Theodore Roosevelt {{initiated}} dozens of suits under the Sherman <b>Antitrust</b> Act and coaxed reforms out of Congress. In 1901, U.S. Steel, then controlled by J. Pierpont Morgan, having bought Andrew Carnegie's steel assets, {{offered to buy}} Standard's iron interests as well. A deal brokered by Henry Clay Frick exchanged Standard's iron interests for U.S. Steel stock and gave Rockefeller and his son membership on the company’s board of directors. In full retirement at age 63, Rockefeller earned over $58 million in investments in 1902.|$|E
