25|$|INTERVIEWER: Suppose {{someone called}} {{you and said}} there was a kid, {{nineteen}} or twenty years old, who has been a very good boy, {{but all of a sudden}} this week he started walking around the neighborhood carrying a large cross. The neighbors are upset and the family's upset, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> do something about it. How would you think about that as a problem? Some kind of bizarre behavior like that.|$|E
2500|$|Byrd {{served in}} the Senate Democratic leadership. He succeeded George Smathers as {{secretary}} of the Senate Democratic Conference from 1967 to 1971. He unseated Ted Kennedy in 1971 to become majority whip, or the second highest-ranking Democrat, until 1977. Smathers recalled that, [...] "Ted was off playing. While Ted was away at Christmas, down in the islands, floating around having a good time with some of his friends, male and female, here was Bob up here calling on the phone. 'I want to do this, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> help me?' He had it all committed so that when Teddy got back to town, Teddy didn't know what hit him, but it was already all over. That was Lyndon Johnson's style. Bob Byrd learned that from watching Lyndon Johnson." [...] Byrd himself had told Smathers that [...] " [...] I have never in my life played a game of cards. I have never in my life had a golf club in my hand. I have never in life hit a tennis ball. I have—believe it or not—never thrown a line over to catch a fish. I don't do any of those things. I have only had to work all my life. And every time you told me about swimming, I don't know how to swim." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{decision}} to do an episode about Anne Frank, Murphy said, [...] "We have a great writing staff but I will take credit for that. One of the things we've done on the show is we take historical figures – {{last year was the}} Black Dahlia and this year is Anne Frank. The Black Dahlia particularly was a case that was never solved so we solved that case in our way. The Anne Frank thing was always interesting to me because after the war, much like the Anastasia case, there were many women who came forward after that diary and said, 'Well I'm the real Anne Frank,' and they were struck down. Many of them were found to be mentally ill and suffering from schizophrenia, so I read about those cases. Before we even wrote one word of it, I thought there was sort of only one actress I was interested in playing Anne Frank and that was Franka. So I brought her in and said, 'I'm gonna write this for you <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> do it.' And we had no script because we were very early on in the season. She loved the story and I sorta swore her to secrecy and God bless her heart she had like five months without telling anybody. I love how it came together." ...|$|E
