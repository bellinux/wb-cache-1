5|$|A large {{percentage}} of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event; rather than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that occurs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E

5|$|Causes include falls, vehicle collisions, and violence.

5|$|The Société des Gens des Lettres, a Parisian {{organization}} of writers, planned {{a monument to}} French novelist Honoré de Balzac immediately {{after his death in}} 1850. The society commissioned Rodin to create the memorial in 1891, and Rodin spent years developing the concept for his sculpture. Challenged in finding an appropriate representation of Balzac given the author's rotund physique, Rodin produced many studies: portraits, full-length figures in the nude, wearing a frock coat, or in a robe– a replica of which Rodin had requested. The realized sculpture displays Balzac cloaked in the drapery, looking forcefully into the distance with deeply gouged features. Rodin's intent had been to show Balzac <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> conceiving a work– to express courage, labor, and struggle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{discuss the}} main {{characteristic}} {{features in the}} heliospheric parameters important for the GCR intensity modulation {{for the last three}} solar minima (1986 – 1987, 1996 – 1997 and 2008 – 2009). The model for the GCR intensity modulation is considered and the set of the model parameters is chosen which allows the description of the observed GCR intensity distributions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maximum GCR intensity in two solar minima (1987 and 1997) normal for {{the second half of the}} last century. Then we try to describe with the above model and set of parameters the unusually soft GCR energy spectra <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maximum GCR intensity in the last solar minimum between cycles 23 and 24 (2009). Our main conclusion is that the most simple way to do so is to reduce the size of the modulation region and, probably, change the rigidity dependence of the diffusion coefficient. The change of both parameters is substantiated by the observations of the solar wind and heliospheric magnetic field...|$|R

5|$|Witnesses near King <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> {{his death}} {{said that the}} shot came from another location. They said that it came from behind thick {{shrubbery}} near the boarding house—which had been cut away {{in the days following}} the assassination—and not from the boarding house window. However, Ray's fingerprints were found on various objects (a rifle, a pair of binoculars, articles of clothing, a newspaper) that were left in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire came from. An examination of the rifle containing Ray's fingerprints also determined that at least one shot was fired from the firearm {{at the time of the}} assassination.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} these theories (excepting that of Preston) {{is given in}} Jurens's 1987 article. Its main conclusion is that the loss was almost certainly precipitated by the explosion of a 4-inch magazine, but that {{there are several ways}} this could have been initiated, although he rules out the boat deck fire or the detonation of her torpedoes as probable causes. In Jurens's opinion, the popular image of plunging shells penetrating Hoods deck armour is inaccurate, as by his estimation the angle of fall of Bismarcks 15-inch shells <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> the loss would not have exceeded about 14°, an angle so unfavourable to penetration of horizontal armour that it is actually off the scale of contemporaneous German penetration charts. Moreover, computer-generated profiles of Hood show that a shell falling at this angle could not have reached an aft magazine without first passing through some part of the belt armour. On the other hand, the 12-inch belt could have been penetrated, if Hood had progressed sufficiently far into her final turn.|$|E

Rumsfeld returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials. On the day of the attacks, DoD officials considered moving their command operations to Site R, a backup facility in Pennsylvania. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, and sent Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Site R. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) continued to operate at the Pentagon, even as smoke entered the facility. Engineers and building managers manipulated the ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC and bring in fresh air.|$|E

5|$|Clinical data alone may be {{sufficient}} for {{a diagnosis of}} MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain and}} spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> the evaluation. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS. The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.|$|E
5|$|When the Prussians broke camp, {{they left}} {{a handful of}} light troops to {{demonstrate}} before the French advance post commanded by the Comte de Saint Germain. These light troops constituted the flank guard on the Schartau hill, which lay {{at right angles to}} the Janus and Pölzen. Frederick had no intention of either forming a line parallel to the enemy or of retreating. His army could move as a unit twice as fast as the Allies' army. If, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> contact, the Allies had already formed their line of battle facing north, then his attack would strike their right flank; if they were still on the move in columns eastwards or northeastwards, the heads of their columns would be crushed before the rest could deploy in the new direction, deployment being a lengthy affair for most armies.|$|E
5|$|On lap 272, Martin {{reclaimed}} {{the lead}} {{as the previous}} leaders had made their pit stops. Four laps later, the eighth caution was given because of debris on the track in turns three and four. Most of the drivers made pit stops during the caution, although Martin stayed out and remained the leader on the restart. After the restart, the ninth caution was given after Reutimann and Earnhardt made contact, causing Earnhardt to collide with the turn two wall. At the lap 287 restart, Martin remained the leader ahead of Kurt Busch. One lap later, Montoya moved up into third after passing Hamlin and Johnson. On lap 289, Montoya passed Kurt Busch at the first turn for the second position. One lap later, Kurt Busch lost a further position when he was passed by Hamlin. On lap 292, Martin had a 1.1-second lead. Two laps later, the tenth caution came out after Allmendinger spun in turn two after he made contact with Marcos Ambrose. Martin led on the restart, followed by Montoya and Hamlin. On the final lap, Allmendinger spun sideways, bringing out the eleventh and final caution, and the field was frozen, with the finishing order determined by where the drivers were running <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> caution. The result gave Martin the victory, which was his fifth win of the 2009 season. Hamlin finished second, ahead of Montoya in third, Johnson in fourth, and Kyle Busch in fifth.
