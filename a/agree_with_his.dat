5|$|Nigel died on 30 May 1169. In either 1164 or in 1166, or {{possibly}} both, {{he had been}} struck by paralysis, and after this {{he seems to have}} withdrawn from active affairs. He took little part in the disputes between the king and Thomas Becket, although he did <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> fellow bishops who opposed the king's attempt to reduce clerical benefits. He may have been buried at Ely, where a 12th-century marble slab possibly marks his tomb.|$|E
5|$|Miles {{becomes the}} new owner of the caravan park. He becomes good friends with Leah and {{falls in love with}} her. She feels it is to soon after husband Dan's death and does not feel the same, leaving him upset. Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) then helps him track down Jai, a boy from Phuket whom he told he would help, but never did. He comes to live with Miles, their {{relationship}} is strained by Jai's reluctance to trust him, eventually they become close. Religious Christine Jones (Elizabeth Alexander) later starts a campaign to have Miles removed from his job when she does not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> choice of book used for teaching. Morag later helps rid of Christine and saves his career. He lets Melody Jones stay with him, but she rebels and causes trouble for him with her new-found bad attitude. He then has a brief relationship with Jazz Curtis (Rachel Gordon).|$|E

25|$|Hardin {{claimed that}} after killing Maje, he shot three Union {{soldiers}} of the U.S. 4th Cavalry Regiment at a creek crossing at Logallis Prairie (now Nogalus Prairie, Trinity County, Texas). None of the military records name Hardin as a suspect, nor do any facts <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> claims. Circumstantial evidence is that a murder was committed here, but the names and numbers of victims are unknown.|$|E
25|$|A {{treaty of}} {{alliance}} between Great Britain and Spain was concluded by him in 1793, but as the climate of that country did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> health he returned home early in 1794. Very shortly after his landing in England, St. Helens {{was appointed to the}} ambassadorship at the Hague (25 March 1794), where he remained until the French conquered the country, when the danger of his situation caused much anxiety to his friends.|$|E
25|$|Victoria {{tried to}} {{convince}} her husband to accept his father's abdication. However, the prince did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wife and supported his father, saying that he would stand firm before the Landtag. For Frederick, the abdication of a monarch after a conflict with the Parliament would create a dangerous precedent and weaken his successors. The Crown Prince also judged that his support to his father's abdication in his favour would be a serious dereliction of his duties as a son.|$|E

25|$|I {{frequently}} have differed with {{the opinions of}} Dr. Sylvanus G. Morley. This is easily {{explained by the fact}} that he is one of the few archaeologists who have studied the hieroglyphs of Chichen Itza. While I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> results on the inscriptions of the Old Empire cities which contain many dates and time periods, I find that his method of dealing solely with calendrical matter fails at Chichen Itza, since there are but few hieroglyphs of that nature.|$|E
25|$|The Yongle Emperor's {{tolerance}} of Chinese ideas {{that did not}} <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> own philosophies was well known. He treated Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism equally (though he favoured Confucianism). Strict Confucianists considered him hypocritical, but his even-handed approach helped him win {{the support of the}} people and unify China. His love for Chinese culture sparked a sincere hatred for Mongol culture. He considered it rotten and forbade the use of popular Mongol names, habits, language, and clothing. Great lengths were taken by the Yongle Emperor to eradicate Mongol culture from China.|$|E
25|$|He {{was dropped}} ostensibly {{for a lack}} of form, but it was also widely viewed that the England {{management}} did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> temperament– he famously knocked his stumps out of the ground after being bowled in the 1988 Sydney Bicentennial Test. He was fined the maximum permitted (£500) by the tour manager. Broad last played for England in the second Test against Australia in 1989, having played in 25 Test matches with a high score of 162 and an average of 39.54. Unusually, he made all of his centuries outside England– four in Australia, one in New Zealand and one in Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|The {{preparations}} for the Union campaign did not proceed smoothly, and Halleck seemed more concerned with his standing in relation to General-in-Chief George B. McClellan than he did with understanding the Confederate Army was divided and could be defeated in detail. Further, he could not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> peer, Buell, now in Nashville, on a joint course of action. He sent Grant up the Tennessee River while Buell remained in Nashville. On March 11, President Lincoln appointed Halleck the commander of all forces from the Missouri River to Knoxville, Tennessee, thus achieving the needed unity of command, and Halleck ordered Buell to join Grant's forces at Pittsburg Landing on the Tennessee River.|$|E
25|$|Still {{operating}} as a Missouri militia general (rather {{than as a}} commissioned Confederate officer), Price was unable to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> Wilson's Creek colleague, Brigadier General Benjamin McCulloch, {{as to how to}} proceed following the battle; this led to the splitting of what might otherwise have become a sizable Confederate force in the West. Price and McCulloch became bitter rivals, leading to the ultimate appointment of Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn as overall commander of the Trans-Mississippi district. Van Dorn reunited Price's and McCulloch's formations into a force he named the Army of the West, and set out to engage Unionist troops in Missouri under the command of Brig. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis. Now under Van Dorn's command, Price was commissioned in the Confederate States Army as a major general on March 6, 1862.|$|E
25|$|While Russell wrote a {{great deal}} on ethical subject matters, he did not believe that the subject belonged to {{philosophy}} or that when he wrote on ethics that he did so in his capacity as a philosopher. In his earlier years, Russell was greatly influenced by G.E. Moore's Principia Ethica. Along with Moore, he then believed that moral facts were objective, but known only through intuition; that they were simple properties of objects, not equivalent (e.g., pleasure is good) to the natural objects to which they are often ascribed (see Naturalistic fallacy); and that these simple, undefinable moral properties cannot be analysed using the non-moral properties with which they are associated. In time, however, he came to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> philosophical hero, David Hume, who believed that ethical terms dealt with subjective values that cannot be verified {{in the same way as}} matters of fact.|$|E
5000|$|Halldór Hermansson (1930) also placed Straumfjord in Chaleur Bay, [...] "where {{the tide}} rises {{from five to}} ten feet". Matthias Thordarsson, who {{authored}} The Vinland Voyages (1930), <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> views.|$|R

25|$|Under {{this form}} of government, called the Westminster system, the Sovereign is head of state and titular head of Her Majesty's Government. She selects as her Prime Minister {{the person who is}} able to command a working {{majority}} in the House of Commons, and invites him or her to form a government. As the actual Head of Government, the Prime Minister selects his Cabinet, choosing its members from among those in Parliament who agree or generally <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> intended policies. He then recommends them to the Sovereign who confirms his selections by formally appointing them to their offices. Led by the Prime Minister, the Cabinet is collectively responsible for whatever the government does. The Sovereign does not confer with members privately about policy, nor attend Cabinet meetings. With respect to actual governance, the monarch has only three constitutional rights: to be kept informed, to advise, and to warn. In practice this means that the Sovereign reviews state papers and meets regularly with the Prime Minister, usually weekly, when she may advise and warn him or her regarding the proposed decisions and actions of Her Government.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Opera and Drama" [...] (1851), Wagner {{described}} {{the aesthetics of}} drama that he was using to create the Ring operas. Before leaving Dresden, Wagner had drafted a scenario that eventually became the four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen. He initially [...] for a single opera, Siegfrieds Tod (Siegfried's Death), in 1848. After arriving in Zürich, he expanded the story with the opera Der junge Siegfried (Young Siegfried), which explored the hero's background. He completed {{the text of the}} cycle by writing the libretti for Die Walküre (The Valkyrie) and Das Rheingold (The Rhine Gold) and revising the other libretti to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> new concept, completing them in 1852. The concept of opera expressed in [...] "Opera and Drama" [...] and in other essays effectively renounced the operas he had previously written, up to and including Lohengrin. Partly in an attempt to explain his change of views, Wagner published in 1851 the autobiographical [...] "A Communication to My Friends". This contained his first public announcement of what was to become the Ring cycle: ...|$|E
500|$|After the war, Gellibrand {{returned}} to Tasmania. In 1919 {{he accepted the}} post of Public Service Commissioner in Tasmania. He investigated {{the conditions of the}} service, and recommended reforms. He then took up a position as Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police in Victoria, but failed to get the Victorian government to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> recommendations for reform, and resigned in 1922. While in Melbourne, Gellibrand commanded the 3rd Division, but had to resign when he {{returned to}} Tasmania in 1922. He entered Federal politics in 1925, and was elected the member for Denison. He was defeated in the 1928 and 1929 elections, and returned to farming, first in Tasmania, and then in Victoria. In the late 1930s, he was consulted by Prime Ministers Joseph Lyons and Robert Menzies about defence matters. He campaigned for an increase {{in the size of the}} Australian Army, and, after the outbreak of the Second World War, lobbied the Menzies government to appoint Major General Sir [...] Thomas Blamey as Commander in Chief of the Army. In June 1940, he was appointed commandant of the Victorian Volunteer Defence Corps, the Australian version of the British Home Guard, but ill-health forced him to resign.|$|E
60|$|Whether Uncle Bat <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> niece or <b>with</b> <b>his</b> grandnieces was {{not very}} {{apparent}} from the line of his argument; but they all laughed at his eagerness, and nothing more was said that evening about the matter.|$|R

50|$|After not <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> {{playing time}} and {{contract}} numbers, he forced {{the team to}} trade him to the Houston Oilers {{in exchange for a}} conditional draft pick (not exercised) on July 13, 1973.|$|R
500|$|It was {{originally}} thought that for NHL {{participating in the}} 2014 Winter Olympics a deal {{would have to be}} negotiated between the NHL and NHLPA in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. In January 2013, the NHL and NHLPA agreed on a new Collective Bargaining Agreement. However, the decision on NHL participation at the Olympics was later announced on 19 July 2013. As part of the deal, the NHL will go on break for 17 days during the Olympics and will send 13 on-ice officials to help with the Games. NHL management was hesitant to commit to the tournament; Bettman argued the Olympic break is a [...] "strain on the players, on the schedule and on fans", adding that [...] "the benefits we get tend to be greater when the Olympics are in North America than when they're in distant time zones." [...] According to Bettman, most of the NHL team owners <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> position, and feel that the league does not receive enough benefits to justify the schedule break and risk of player injuries. René Fasel wants NHL participation and vowed that he would [...] "work day and night to have NHL players in Sochi".|$|E
500|$|The {{stewards}} elected not to {{take any}} action over the incident between Prost and Heidfeld on the race's 44th lap. Heidfeld believed {{the origins of the}} accident came from both Andretti cars being released under the minimum pit stop time, saying he drove onto the pit lane alongside Félix da Costa and ceded the position to the Andretti driver. He additionally stated that Bird was also involved and remained ahead of him. Prost was resolute that the contact was avoidable had he been given enough space by Heidfeld. He was confident the stewards would <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> point of view. [...] "I was on the kerb and he did not leave me any room at all when I was at his side", he said. Evans thought after he was hit by Rosenqvist, he could not finish the race and felt his Jaguar would not survive such a collision in a similar scenario. Nevertheless, he was delighted with his first points-scoring finish in the series, saying: [...] "Those first points are always the hardest. We know we've not got the best package but we're making great progress and everyone should be really proud." [...] Jaguar team principal James Barclay said the incident was the moment when [...] "our hearts sunk". He felt there was no possibility of finishing the race but praised the strength of the Jaguar's monocoque.|$|E
500|$|Occasional successes notwithstanding, Holst {{found that}} [...] "man cannot live by {{composition}} alone"; he took posts as organist at various London churches, and continued playing the trombone in theatre orchestras. In 1898 {{he was appointed}} first trombonist and répétiteur with the Carl Rosa Opera Company and toured with the Scottish Orchestra. Though a capable rather than a virtuoso player he won the praise of the leading conductor Hans Richter, for whom he played at Covent Garden. His salary was only just enough to live on, and he supplemented it by playing in a popular orchestra called the [...] "White Viennese Band", conducted by Stanislas Wurm. Holst enjoyed playing for Wurm, and learned much from him about drawing rubato from players. Nevertheless, longing to devote his time to composing, Holst found the necessity of playing for [...] "the Worm" [...] or any other light orchestra [...] "a wicked and loathsome waste of time". Vaughan Williams did not altogether <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> friend about this; he admitted {{that some of the}} music was [...] "trashy" [...] but thought it had been useful to Holst nonetheless: [...] "To start with, the very worst a trombonist has to put up with is as nothing compared to what a church organist has to endure; and secondly, Holst is above all an orchestral composer, and that sure touch which distinguishes his orchestral writing is due largely {{to the fact that he}} has been an orchestral player; he has learnt his art, both technically and in substance, not at second hand from text books and models, but from actual live experience." ...|$|E
