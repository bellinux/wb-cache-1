50|$|Polarized light {{reflected}} from {{an ordinary}} motion picture screen typically loses {{most of its}} polarization, but the loss is negligible if a silver screen or <b>aluminized</b> <b>screen</b> is used. This means that a pair of aligned DLP projectors, some polarizing filters, a silver screen, and a computer with a dual-head graphics card {{can be used to}} form a relatively high-cost (over US$10,000 in 2010) system for displaying stereoscopic 3D data simultaneously to a group of people wearing polarized glasses.|$|E
50|$|Polarized light {{reflected}} from {{an ordinary}} motion picture screen typically loses {{most of its}} polarization. So an expensive silver screen or <b>aluminized</b> <b>screen</b> with negligible polarization loss has to be used. All types of polarization {{will result in a}} darkening of the displayed image and poorer contrast compared to non-3D images. Light from lamps is normally emitted as a random collection of polarizations, while a polarization filter only passes a fraction of the light. As a result, the screen image is darker. This darkening can be compensated by increasing the brightness of the projector light source. If the initial polarization filter is inserted between the lamp and the image generation element, the light intensity striking the image element is not any higher than normal without the polarizing filter, and overall image contrast transmitted to the screen is not affected.|$|E
40|$|Currently, Colombia has 3, 390 ha {{cultivated}} {{with tomato}} under greenhouse conditions characterized by their {{low level of}} climate control. In areas where low night temperatures limit tomato production, we evaluated the effect of <b>aluminized</b> <b>screens</b> on {{the production of the}} crop. This work was conducted in two greenhouses planted with tomato in Susa and Chia (Cundinamarca). Each greenhouse was divided in two sections, one half covered with the screen and the other not. Screens at both locations were closed between 5 : 00 pm and 6 : 00 am. Inside each greenhouse section, temperature (T, °C) and relative humidity (HR, %) were recorded during the production cycle, as well as the external climate conditions. The effect of <b>aluminized</b> <b>screens</b> on tomato production was compared against the simulation output of the tomato potential growth model “Tomgro”. In both locations the covered section with the screen yielded the highest temperatures during the night. At Chia, the night temperature increase due to the screen effect was 1. 5 �} 0. 10 °C, while in Susa the temperature increase was 1. 1 �} 0. 1 °C. Recorded yield under the screened sections showed increments of 6. 6 % (Chia) and 3. 3 % (Susa). Simulation results suggest that yield increments of about 15. 7 and 13. 6 % are achievable under potential conditions in Chia and Susa, respectively. The use of thermal screens during night hours helps to retain heat, which in turn is reflected in production increments...|$|R
40|$|A {{real-time}} {{charged particle}} beam probe was developed, {{which can be}} used both as a beam diagnostic (beam tuning) and to quantitatively determine the three-dimensional density distribution of a beam. The probe consists of a microchannel plate, an <b>aluminized</b> phosphor <b>screen</b> deposited on a fiber-optic faceplate, a flexible fiber-optic bundle, and a charge injection device (CID) in tandem. Digital or analog video output of the CID is fed into a computer or oscilloscope, respectively, for analysis or observation. The probe can be moved continuously along the beams' paths to obtain 'pictures' of the beam at any desired interval, thus giving three-dimensional form factors. The beams, singly or simultaneously, may be observed on the monitor facilitating the task of beam adjustment for optimum overlap. The digital output is used for quantitative computation of the beam overlaps. The device is linear with beam intensity, but the performance degrades with time due to beam damage of the microchannel plate...|$|R
40|$|Objetivou-se com este trabalho avaliar caracteres fisiológicos e fitotécnicos do gladíolo Amsterdam, bem como acompanhar seu desenvolvimento através de análise de crescimento. O gladíolo foi cultivado em quatro ambientes de luz: a pleno sol (controle) e sob três telas &# 8722; aluminizada, vermelha e azul &# 8722;, que restringiram em 50 % a luminosidade global. Os bulbos, com perímetro entre 12 e 14 cm, foram plantados em vasos com capacidade para 11 L contendo substrato apropriado. Para monitorar a temperatura e a umidade durante todo o ciclo das plantas, foram instalados miniloggers (HT- 500). Os experimentos foram feitos em delineamento inteiramente casualizado com 60 vasos em cada ambiente de luz, dos quais cinco foram utilizados para a medição dos caracteres fitotécnicos, cinco foram deixados no ambiente após a colheita da haste para completarem o amadurecimento dos bulbos e 32 foram empregados na análise de crescimento, sendo o restante usado na bordadura. Quando as plantas exibiram duas folhas definitivas, foram feitas medições da fotossíntese em relação às intensidades luminosas e em relação às horas do dia, da intensidade luminosa em relação às horas do dia e das curvas da qualidade do espectro da luz nos quatro ambientes de cultivo. Medições pontuais de trocas gasosas e fluorescência da clorofila foram iniciadas aos 36 dias após o plantio e repetidas a cada intervalo de 10 dias, sendo quatro na primavera e cinco no outono. A análise de crescimento iniciou-se aos 21 dias depois do plantio, quando as plantas apresentavam o primeiro par de folhas. Ocorreram oito coletas em cada estação de cultivo. Não houve efeito significativo entre as médias de tratamentos no final de cada época de cultivo sobre os parâmetros de trocas gasosas. A condutância estomática, transpiração e concentração interna de carbono na câmara subestomática foram mais baixas na primavera, mas não limitantes da qualidade da haste floral. Os parâmetros de fluorescência da clorofila não indicaram presença de estresse no gladíolo nas duas épocas de cultivo. Nos tratamentos com telas, o número {{de flores}} na espiga floral foi maior na primavera. O gladíolo apresentou médias do comprimento da parte aérea superiores às do controle, sendo maiores no outono. Nas duas épocas avaliadas, o gladíolo sob tela azul não alcançou a melhor classificação {{comercial}} (10 mm) quanto ao diâmetro da haste, e o diâmetro da flor foi menor no outono. Apenas nos tratamentos com telas aluminizada e vermelha as plantas alcançaram o melhor padrão comercial (&# 8805; 110 cm) para o comprimento da haste floral. As médias de massa seca da haste floral do gladíolo cultivado sob telas vermelha e aluminizada e a pleno sol foram superiores às do gladíolo sob tela azul. A massa seca total (MST) e a área foliar (AF) apresentaram padrão de crescimento de uma curva sigmoidal, e o gladíolo cultivado sob tela azul teve menor MST. A área foliar específica (AFE) do gladíolo sob tela azul foi maior que as demais nas duas estações de cultivo. A duração de área foliar (DAF), tanto na primavera quanto no outono, teve forte crescimento. Enquanto as plantas estavam com acelerado crescimento vegetativo, elas começaram a ficar estáveis aos 63 DAP. A razão de área foliar (RAF) e a razão de massa foliar (RMF) foram elevadas nas primeiras coletas, indicando forte investimento em folhas. A razão de massa de bulbos (RMB) a pleno sol foi maior do que nos tratamentos com telas. No tratamento a pleno sol, as médias da altura de planta foram menores nas duas épocas de cultivo. O gladíolo cultivado sob telas aluminizada e vermelha apresentaram vigoroso crescimento e maior número de características comercialmente desejáveis. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate physiological and phytotechnical characters of gladiolus Amsterdam, as well as monitor its development through growth analysis. The gladiolus was grown in four different light environments: full sunlight (control) and under three <b>screens</b> &# 8722; <b>aluminized,</b> red and blue &# 8722;, which restricted in 50 % the overall brightness. Bulbs with circumference between 12 and 14 cm were planted in pots with capacity of 11 L containing appropriate substrate. To monitor the temperature and humidity throughout the entire plant cycle, miniloggers (HT- 500) were installed. The experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design with 60 pots in each light environment, of which five were used for the phytotechnical characters measurement, five were left in the environment after stem harvest to complete the ripening of the bulbs and 32 were employed in growth analysis, the rest was used in the border. When plants exhibited two true leaves, photosynthesis measurements were made in relation to light intensity and time of day, light intensity in relation to time of day and spectrum quality curves in the four culture environments. Spot measurements of gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence were initiated 36 days after planting and repeated every 10 days, four in spring and five in autumn. Growth analysis started 21 days after planting, when the plants presented the first pair of leaves. There were eight samples in each growing season. There was no significant effect between treatment averages in the end of each growing season regarding leaf gas exchange. The stomatal conductance, transpiration, and internal carbon dioxide concentration in the substomatal chambers were lower during spring, but not limiting the quality of the flower stem. The chlorophyll fluorescence parameters indicated no presence of stress in gladiolus in two cropping seasons. In treatments with screens, the number of flowers in floral spike was higher during spring. The gladiolus showed a superior average in the length of the aerial part than the ones of control, being greater in autumn. In both evaluated periods, the gladiolus under blue screen did not reach the best commercial classification (10 mm) as for the stem diameter, and flower diameter was smaller in autumn. Only in the treatments with <b>aluminized</b> and red <b>screens</b> the plants achieved the best commercial standard (&# 8805; 110 cm) as for the length of the flower stem. The average dry matter of the flower stem of the gladiolus grown under red and <b>aluminized</b> <b>screens</b> and full sunlight were greater than the gladiolus under blue screen. The total dry matter (TDM) and leaf area (LA) showed growth pattern of a sigmoidal curve, and gladiolus grown under blue screen had lower TDM. Specific leaf area (SLA) of gladiolus under blue screen was greater than the others in the two growing seasons. The leaf area duration (LAD), both in spring and autumn, had strong growth. While the plants had accelerated vegetative growth, they began to be stable at 63 DAP. The leaf area ratio (LAR) and leaf weight ratio (LWR) were elevated in the first samplings, indicating strong investment in leaves. The bulb weight ratio (BWR) in full sunlight was greater than in treatments with screens. In the full sunlight treatment, the averages of plant height were lower in the two growing seasons. The gladiolus grown under red and <b>aluminized</b> <b>screens</b> presented vigorous growth and greater number of commercially desirable characteristics...|$|R

The experiment was conducted in the experimental area of the State University of Mato Grosso do Sul, in Aquidauana. In the seedling phase we tested substrates (100 % triturated cassava stems, 75 % triturated cassava stems and 25 % vermiculite, 50 % triturated cassava stems and 50 % vermiculite, 25 % triturated cassava stems and 75 % vermiculite and 100 % vermiculite). These substrates were placed in two protected environments (nursery with black screen, 50 % of shading, and <b>aluminized</b> <b>screen,</b> 50 % of shading). Each environment was considered an experiment conducted in completely randomized design with eight replications. After that we realized joint analysis. In the field, a total of 10 treatments generated from combinations of environments and substrates (2 environments x 5 substrates) were distributed in a randomized block design with four replications. The average proportions of cassava stems and vermiculite may be suitable for okra seedlings. The results of shoot and total dry phytomass indicate that the <b>aluminized</b> <b>screen</b> can be recommended for okra seedlings production when the substrate with a 1 : 1 ratio is used. Seedlings grown on higher percentages of vermiculite anticipate production, while seedlings produced only in cassava stems tend to slow it down. The <b>aluminized</b> <b>screen</b> tends to increase the yield of okra seedlings. Average proportions of vermiculite and cassava stems for seedling production under <b>aluminized</b> <b>screen,</b> provide more fruits and yield of okra in Aquidauana...|$|E

The environments covered with screen (black and aluminized monofilament) showed best results to height and leaf number during experimental development. Polyethylene bags were the best containers to grow papaya seedlings. The substrate with vermiculite showed the best results in both containers and all environments.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{characterize}} {{the influence of a}} thermal screen on: the greenhouse microclimate, energy savings and crop transpiration. Measurements were carried out during winter in a glasshouse cultivated with a rose crop and equipped with an <b>aluminized</b> thermal <b>screen.</b> Air temperature and humidity were recorded at 0. 3 m, 0. 8 m and 1. 8 m high inside the greenhouse. Net radiation over and under the thermal screen; and under the rose crop, leaf temperature and crop transpiration were simultaneously monitored. The results indicated that the thermal screen induced a more homogeneous microclimate, and increased air temperature and canopy temperature by about 2. 5 °C and 3 °C respectively. Canopy net radiation was increased while transpiration was similar in both cases, showing cyclic fluctuations that appeared to be due to internal physiological control processes rather than to response to microclimatic variables. The air vapour pressure deficit VPD in {{the lower part of the}} canopy was similar in both cases, as well as the canopy to air VPD and the dew-point temperature. These results suggest that the use of a thermal screen brings several advantages, such as a more homogeneous greenhouse microclimate, a reduction in heat consumption and a significant increase in canopy temperature in the lower part of the crop, but does not improve the humidity conditions...|$|R

40|$|Greenhouse microclimate, energy savings, {{and crop}} {{transpiration}} were investigated during winter in a glass-covered greenhouse cultivated with a rose crop and {{equipped with an}} <b>aluminized</b> thermal <b>screen.</b> Air temperature and humidity profiles were recorded at 0. 3, 0. 8, and 1. 8 m heights inside the greenhouse. Net radiation over and under the rose crop, heating pipe temperature, canopy temperature at 0. 3 and 0. 8 m, and transpiration rate were simultaneously measured and recorded. When compared to unscreened conditions, {{it was found that}} the thermal screen provided a more homogeneous microclimate and increased the average air temperature and canopy temperature at 0. 8 m by about 2. 5 °C and 3. 0 °C, respectively. The latter result was attributed to the observed increase (about 100 %) in the net radiation absorbed by the canopy, along with reflection of long-wave radiation by the thermal screen. Higher canopy-to-air vapor pressure deficits (+ 0. 3 kPa) were observed in the lower layer (bent shoots) under screened conditions. Canopy transpiration rate was of the same order of magnitude in both cases. Energy savings due to the screen was estimated to be about 15 %. The body of results underlines that the basic effect of the studied screen on crop behavior was the doubling of the net radiation absorbed by the canopy, with positive consequences on both air and canopy temperature, and therefore on growth, development, and sanitary conditions of the rose plants...|$|R
