25|$|The largest {{level in}} Marine {{aviation}} is the Marine Aircraft Wing, {{the equivalent of}} a division. Wings are usually grouped with <b>a</b> <b>Marine</b> division and <b>a</b> <b>Marine</b> Logistics Group to form <b>a</b> <b>Marine</b> Expeditionary Force. Administratively, Marine aviation is organized into three active duty MAWs and one reserve MAW. MAWs are designed to provide units in support of MAGTF or other operations. Each MAW has a unique organizational structure. The MAW may be reinforced with assets from other MAWs to provide the necessary assets to meet mission requirements. The MAW contains <b>a</b> <b>Marine</b> Aircraft Wing Headquarters (MAW HQ), that directs and coordinates the operations of the MAW, <b>a</b> <b>Marine</b> Wing Headquarters Squadron (MWHS) (see: MWHS-1, MWHS-2 and MWHS-3), which provides administrative and supply support for the MAW HQ, three or four Marine Aircraft Groups (MAGs), and <b>a</b> <b>Marine</b> Air Control Group (MACG). The mission of the MAW is to conduct air operations in support of the Marine Forces to include offensive air support, anti-aircraft warfare, assault support, aerial reconnaissance, electronic warfare, and the control of aircraft and missiles. As a collateral function, the MAW may participate as an integral component of naval aviation in the execution of such other Navy functions as the Fleet Commander may direct.|$|E

25|$|The tectonic {{evolution}} of {{the area of the}} present-day Eastern Hills started with <b>a</b> <b>marine</b> back-arc basin in the Late Jurassic.

The central region of current Colombia, the later Eastern Cordillera, was characterised by the deposition of calcareous shales with turbidite deposits from the Cáqueza area. During the Late Aptian to Early Albian, <b>a</b> <b>marine</b> shale-dominated sedimentation existed with more carbonate-rich deposits to the north, represented by the mosasaur fossil-bearing Paja Formation in Boyacá. The Turonian stage of the Cretaceous era experienced a worldwide anoxic event that produced highly organic shales in the area, today represented by the Chipaque Formation. The Upper Cretaceous sequence, illustrated in the stratigraphy by the Guadalupe Group, was deposited in <b>a</b> <b>marine</b> environment with alternating sandstones and shales.|$|E
