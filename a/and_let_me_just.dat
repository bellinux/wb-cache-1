But that said, once I got the equipment on and {{was out on the}} ice, I loved that. I loved hitting people, being hit, skating. I love the exertion and competition, so that was all great.

5000|$|Skiba {{heard the}} song and wrote the second verse, singing the vocal take in one pass. Barker's {{drumming}} on the verses was inspired by drum and bass music. [...] "John would be like, 'Trav, do some of that weird shit you play with EDM or rap artists.' And I'd be like, 'OK,'" [...] he said on the recording process. At one point, Barker told Feldmann, [...] "Why don't you give me one minute of click <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> play whatever the fuck I want?" [...] His improvisational section became the song's conclusion.|$|E
50|$|The Wild Ones {{were the}} house band at the New York City nightclub Arthur, {{set up by}} socialite Sybil Christopher, who had married the band's former lead singer Jordan Christopher. Although they had issued an album, {{it was not as}} {{successful}} as the band had hoped, and their producer Gerry Granahan contacted Chip Taylor to ask him to write a song for them to release as a single. Taylor said: I started just chuggin’ away on a couple of chords and within a couple of minutes of getting off the phone I had the chorus and I was kind of likin’ it. I didn’t really know what I was going to say in between but I was thinking there was something cool and sweaty about this. So I went to the studio... Because it was a sexual-kind-of-feeling song, I didn’t want to be embarrassed, I wanted to let myself sing it, so I asked producer Ron Johnson to turn the lights out when I got there and have my stool ready and have my microphone ready and when I got there, I said, “Put the tape in record and just let it go <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> keep playin.... And then I stomped on a board, just to give a cool little edge to it and I banged on a tambourine and then Ron was foolin’ around. As the track was playing back, he was doing this little thing with his hands, like when you put a blade of grass in there and you get a whistling sound? Only he was able to it without the blade of grass in it. It sounded cool.... I listened back and I thought it sounded great. I was a little afraid to play it for people because it was so different than anything I’d done before; it wasn’t one of those pretty little country songs. And it was very sexy.Granahan approved the song and produced the Wild Ones' recording, with vocals by Chuck Alden. However, on its release in November 1965 the record failed to sell, and Alden later said that he regretted not performing the song {{in the same way as}} Taylor's demo.|$|E

I was in America when that work appeared, and it was published there in 2 vols. and in very charming and readable form, each vol. but moderately thick and with a legible, handsome, large-typed page. But there {{came over to me}} a copy of the London issue, fat, vile, small-typed, horrific, prohibitive, that so broke my heart that I vowed I wouldn't, for very shame, disseminate it, and I haven't, with that feeling, had a copy in the house or sent one to a single friend. I wish I had an American one at your disposition--but I have been again and again depleted of all ownership in respect to it. You are very welcome to the British brick if you, at this late day, will have it.|$|R
6000|$|Ravenswood {{was at the}} lady's bridle-rein, {{encouraging}} her timidity, {{and guiding}} her horse carefully down the rocky path {{which led to the}} moor, when one of the servants announced from the rear that Caleb was calling loudly after them, desiring to speak with his master. Ravenswood felt it would look singular to neglect this summons, although inwardly cursing Caleb for his impertinent officiousness; therefore he was compelled to relinquish to Mr. Lockhard the agreeable duty in which he was engaged, and to ride back to the gate of the courtyard. Here he was beginning, somewhat peevishly, to ask Caleb the cause of his clamour, when the good old man exclaimed: [...] "Whisht, sir!--whisht, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> speak <b>just</b> ae word that I couldna say afore folk; there (putting into his lord's hand the money he had just received)--there's three gowd pieces; and ye'll want siller up-bye yonder.

5000|$|However, on May 8, 2007, {{during an}} {{interview}} by NPR radio host Diane Rehm, Mr. Breathed responded to an e-mail question regarding the existence of Opus: The Last Christmas by saying, Uh, the better question is, 'Is there an Opus movie going to come out?' {{and the answer is}} 'no.' And, now I can say it's all for the better. Uh, the Weinstein brothers at Miramax tried for five years to develop an Opus movie, their first animated film, <b>and</b> it was, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> say, it probably wasn't destined to be, as ... as it probably shouldn't. And the problem with developing these kinds of movies and films is that inevitably they discover that a property as idiosyncratic as a comic strip doesn't translate well unless you have the confidence of bringing the creator in and factoring him into the creation of the movie. They never, never do that. Yeah, um, they just don't trust us. So without that control there probably shouldn't be an Opus movie. In a June 2007 interview with Salon.com, Breathed confirmed that the Miramax feature was [...] "dead", but left the door open for an independently produced Opus film: There'll only be a movie if I'm writing it, which will probably keep him off the big expensive screen ... probably just as well.|$|R

6000|$|Now {{comes the}} serious part, for it {{happened}} here, and Fred has just gone. He {{has been so}} kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him. I never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till the serenade night. Since then I've begun {{to feel that the}} moonlight walks, balcony talks, and daily adventures were something more to him than fun. I haven't flirted, Mother, truly, but remembered what you said to me, and have done my very best. I can't help it if people like me. I don't try to make them, and it worries me if I don't care for them, though Jo says I haven't got any heart. Now I know Mother will shake her head, and the girls say, [...] "Oh, the mercenary little wretch!", but I've made up my mind, and if Fred asks me, I shall accept him, though I'm not madly in love. I like him, and we get on comfortably together. He is handsome, young, clever enough, and very rich--ever so much richer than the Laurences. I don't think his family would object, and I should be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous people, and they like me. Fred, as the eldest twin, will have the estate, I suppose, and such a splendid one it is! A city house in a fashionable street, not so showy as our big houses, but twice as comfortable and full of solid luxury, such as English people believe in. I like it, for it's genuine. I've seen the plate, the family jewels, the old servants, and pictures of the country place, with its park, great house, lovely grounds, and fine horses. Oh, it would be all I should ask! And I'd rather have it than any title such as girls snap up so readily, and find nothing behind. I may be mercenary, but I hate poverty, and don't mean to bear it a minute longer than I can help. One of us must marry well. Meg didn't, Jo won't, Beth can't yet, so I shall, and make everything okay all round. I wouldn't marry a man I hated or despised. You may be sure of that, and though Fred is not my model hero, he does very well, and in time I should get fond enough of him if he was very fond of <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> do <b>just</b> as I liked. So I've been turning the matter over in my mind the last week, for it was impossible to help seeing that Fred liked me. He said nothing, but little things showed it. He never goes with Flo, always gets on my side of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we are alone, and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak to me. Yesterday at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us and then said something to his friend, a rakish-looking baron, about 'ein wonderschones Blondchen', Fred looked as fierce as a lion, and cut his meat so savagely it nearly flew off his plate. He isn't one of the cool, stiff Englishmen, but is rather peppery, for he has Scotch blood in him, as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes.|$|R
