40|$|Feline tooth {{resorption}} {{has been}} widely reported in domestic cats and sporadically described in other felidae. The goal {{of the present study}} was to determine the prevalence of tooth resorption and to report other dental problems in a population of wild felidae. Observations of dental disorders and anomalies were made in skulls from 73 wild felidae (cheetahs, leopards, <b>caracals,</b> <b>African</b> wildcats, and lions) originating from Namibia. In addition, radiographs were taken in 43 cases to determine signs of bone and root pathology. Radiographs showed varying stages of tooth resorption in 16. 0 % of the specimens. Other dental anomalies found included fused teeth, supernumerary roots, or missing teeth. The prevalence of dental resorption in wild felidae was lower than reported in the domestic cat...|$|R

40|$|Worldwide the cheetah {{population}} is declining making them Africa’s most endangered large cat. Namibia, Africa currently {{has the largest}} population of cheetahs in the world. During the summer of 2014, I did scat analysis of carnivores on {{the property of the}} Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) in Namibia in order to better understand the predators that compete with the cheetah and how the ecosystem works as a whole. I worked at CCF for nine weeks to analyze the diets of carnivores in the area through genetic and scat analysis. Analyzing carnivore feces would ultimately identify the diet of various carnivores in the area. One hundred and eight carnivore scat samples were analyzed including jackal, hyena, genet, serval, leopard, <b>african</b> wildcat, <b>caracal,</b> civet, aardwolf and cheetah samples. This information would help CCF understand how the entire ecosystem interacts and aid them in their efforts to manage and protect the wild cheetah. DNA was extracted from each scat sample to determine the species each sample came from. The DNA was then amplified using polymerase chain reaction. Ultimately, the sequences were compared to a genome reference database and the species were determined by sequence similarity. The scat samples were then washed and the contents were analyzed microscopically and macroscopically. Microscopic analysis involved burning hairs to create imprints and looking at the patterns underneath a microscope. My results revealed that the cheetahs are primarily competing with leopards for their prey. When CCF releases cheetahs back into the wild they will now be able to take my findings into consideration to locate the best release site...|$|R

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of feline panleukopaenia virus (FPLV) infection was diagnosed by pathology, electron microscopy and {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) in vaccinated captive-bred subadult cheetahs in South Africa. Subsequent to this disease outbreak, 12 cases of FPLV diagnosed on histology were confirmed by PCR in captive <b>African</b> black-footed cat, <b>caracal,</b> cheetah, lion, ocelot and serval. Phylogenetic analyses of the viral capsid protein gene on PCR-positive samples, vaccine and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) reference strains identified a previously unknown strain of FPLV, present since at least 2006, that differs from both the inactivated and the modified live vaccine strains. A previously described South African strain from domestic cats and cheetahs was identified in a serval. Surveys of FPLV strains in South African felids are needed to determine the geographical and host species distribution of this virus. Since non-domestic species may be reservoirs of parvoviruses, and since these viruses readily change host specificity, the risks of FPLV transmission between captive-bred and free-ranging carnivores and domestic cats and dogs warrant further research.

5000|$|Leopards must {{compete for}} food and shelter with other large predators such as tigers, lions, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, striped hyenas, brown hyenas, up to five species of bear and both African and Asiatic wild dogs. These animals may steal the leopard's kill, devour its young or even kill adult leopards. Leopards co-exist {{alongside}} these other large predators by hunting for different types of prey and by avoiding areas frequented by them. Leopards may also retreat up a tree {{in the face of}} direct aggression from other large carnivores but leopards have been seen to either kill or prey on competitors such as black-backed jackal, <b>caracal,</b> <b>African</b> wild cat and the cubs of lions, cheetahs, hyenas, and wild dogs. [...] Resource partitioning occurs where leopards share their range with tigers. Leopards tend to take smaller prey, usually less than 75 kg, where tigers are present. In areas where the leopard is sympatric with the tiger, coexistence is reportedly not the general rule, with leopards being few where tigers are numerous. The mean leopard density decreased significantly (from 9.76 to 2.07 animals per 100 km2) when the mean density of tigers increased (from 3.31 animals/100km2 to 5.81 animals/100km2) from 2004-5 to 2007-8 in the Rajaji National Park in India following the relocation of pastoralists out of the park. There, the two species have high dietary overlap, and an increase in the tiger population resulted in a sharp decrease in the leopard population and a shift in the leopard diet to small prey (from 9% to 36%) and domestic prey (from 6.8% to 31.8%). In the Primore region of the Russian Far East, Amur leopards were absent or very rarely encountered at places where Siberian tigers reside. However, in the Chitwan National Park in Nepal, both species coexist because there is a large prey biomass, a large proportion of prey is of the smaller sizes, and dense vegetation exists. Here leopards killed prey ranging from less than 25 kg to 100 kg in weight with most kills in the 25 - 50 kg range; tigers killed more prey in the 50 - 100 kg range. There were also differences in the microhabitat preferences of the individual tiger and leopard followed over 5-month (December to April) period in this study - the tiger used roads and (except in February) forested areas more frequently, while the leopard used recently burned areas and open areas more frequently [...] Usually when a tiger began to kill baits at sites formerly frequented by leopards, the leopards would no longer come and kill there. In the tropical forests of India's Nagarhole National Park, tigers selected prey weighing more than 176 kg, whereas leopards selected prey in the 30 - 175 kg range. In tropical forest they do not always avoid the larger cats by hunting at different times. With relatively abundant prey and differences in the size of prey selected, tigers and leopards seem to successfully coexist without competitive exclusion or inter-species dominance hierarchies that may be more common to the leopard's co-existence with the lion in savanna habitats. In areas with high tiger populations, such as in the central parts of India's Kanha National Park, leopards are not permanent residents, but transients. They were common near villages at the periphery of the park and outside the park.|$|R
