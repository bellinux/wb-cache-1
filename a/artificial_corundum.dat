This work evaluates the effect of mechanical damage on the short-term tensile behaviour of two nonwoven geotextiles (with different masses per unit area). The geotextiles were damaged in laboratory using a standardised procedure and an <b>artificial</b> aggregate (<b>corundum)</b> and eight other soils. The damage induced was characterized using wide-width tensile tests. Results showed reductions of the tensile strength of both geotextiles, which depended on the grain size distribution and uniformity of the soils and on the mass per unit area of the geotextiles. The reduction in tensile strength provoked by corundum was higher than the decreases caused {{by most of the}} other soils. The mechanical damage tests also led to a reduction of elongation at maximum load and an increase of stiffness...|$|R

40|$|Mass {{miniature}} radiography {{surveys in}} a factory producing artificial grinding wheels detected cases of pneumoconiosis, mostly of the silicotic type. All cases were traced to the department where the so-callec "bond " is prepared and mixed with the abrasive grains of carborundum and <b>artificial</b> <b>corundum.</b> This ceramic-vitrified bond, similar in composition to English general earthenware, contained until recently {{a significant proportion of}} free silica. The miniature film survey was followed up by an investigation on full-sized films, in which 92 % of all workers in the bond department participated. The radiographs were subjected to dual independent viewing and it was found that 66 % of the men who had worked in the bond department for more than 10 years showed radiological evidence of pneumoconiosis with a high proportion of progressive massive fibrosis (P. M. F.) Recently the amount of free silica in the ceramic bond has been reduced by the introduction of "frits " in place of powdered flint and part of the factory has been rebuilt and new methods of dust suppression and dust extraction have been introduced. One of the cases presented with the rheumatoid-pneumoconiotic syndrome, first described by Caplan. It is suggested that some of the cases of pneumoconiosis, attributed to carborundum, may b...|$|E

Hodnotí vliv technologických podmínek na řezné síly při broušení, na opotřebení nástrojů a na jakost obrobených ploch za předpokladu změny koncentrace zrn sintrovaného korundu v brousicím kotouči. The paper {{deals with}} the use of {{sintered}} corundum in grinding of tools. It evaluates the impact of technological conditions on cutting forces during grinding, the tool wear and quality of machined surfaces, provided changes in the concentration of grains in sintered corundum grinding wheels. Sintered corundum is a type of <b>artificial</b> <b>corundum,</b> where the feedstock is aluminiummonohydrate which, after merging with Al-dispersion granules of desired size of grains and the subsequent process of acquiring the final strength and surface hardness. Under external loading of the grinding wheel grains separated by a variety of large crystalline fragments and thus produce more grain for sharp points and cutting edges. Among the advantages of the new abrasive is rustiness and thus lower the frequency of dressing and longer life. Of sintered corundum abrasive is designed for grinding hard and very tough materials (hardness of 48 HRc, HSS, etc.). The introduction of grinding wheels with greater porosity is considerable technological and economic benefit. Advantageous is also adding to the sintered corundum grinding wheel. This adjustment significantly improves the rustiness tools. It should be emphasized that the use of new grinding wheels with higher porosity and higher content sintered corundum leads to the deterioration of the arithmetic average roughness of polished surfaces. This disadvantage must be reducing the intensity of technological conditions...|$|E
