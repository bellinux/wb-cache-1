Additionally, no earlier source mentions that Helena was born in Britain, let <b>alone</b> <b>that</b> she was a princess.

Black and Catherine discuss how they would handle infection; Catherine asks to be euthanized, Black states he would wander off to die <b>alone.</b> <b>That</b> night, Catherine wakes up, experiencing symptoms of the disease. She quietly leaves the cabin and walks into the forest. The next morning, Black wakes up, and finding blood on Catherine's pillow, realizes she has gone. He cradles his daughter as the screen flashes images of the collapse of society, interspersed with video noise.|$|E

5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that it was supernatural affairs and Paulinus' persuasion <b>alone</b> <b>that</b> caused Edwin to convert. The Northumbrian nobles {{seem to have been}} willing and the king also received letters from Pope Boniface V urging his conversion. Eventually convinced, Edwin and many of his followers were baptised at York in 627. One story relates that during a stay with Edwin and Æthelburg at their palace in Yeavering, Paulinus spent 36days baptising new converts. Paulinus also was an active missionary in Lindsey, and his missionary activities help show the limits of Edwin's royal authority.|$|E
5|$|The couple moved {{repeatedly}} {{over the}} following year – first to Laguna Beach, California, then to Santa Catalina Island, California, New York City, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania and ultimately to Hubbard's first wife's home at South Colby, Washington. Polly Hubbard had filed for divorce {{on the grounds of}} desertion and non-support, and was not even aware that Hubbard was living with Northrup, let <b>alone</b> <b>that</b> he had married her. The arrival of Hubbard and Northrup three weeks after the divorce was filed scandalized Hubbard's family, who deeply disapproved of his treatment of Polly. Northrup had no idea of Hubbard's first marriage or why people were treating her so strangely until his son L. Ron Hubbard Jr. told her that his parents were still married. She attempted to flee on a ferry but Hubbard caught up with her and convinced her to stay, saying {{that he was in the}} process of getting a divorce and that an attorney had told him that the marriage with Northrup was legal. The couple moved to a rented trailer in North Hollywood in July 1947, where Hubbard spent much of his time writing stories for pulp magazines.|$|E
5|$|The {{major theme}} of Buffy's dream is {{her fear of}} the {{personal}} cost of {{her life as a}} Slayer, the isolation and loneliness she is forced to endure. This theme of aloneness is reiterated by several shots in which she is alone in the frame, most notably the wide shot of her in the vast and empty desert. Another source of anxiety is her relationship with her current boyfriend, Riley, whom she finds plotting world domination with Adam in his original, human, form. She fears what Riley could turn into {{as a result of his}} alliance with the military. She also fears the destabilizing effect of this alliance on their relationship, and the destabilizing effect of this relationship on her life as the slayer. She is shown putting mud on her face, mimicking the mud mask of the primal, First Slayer. By the end of her encounter in the desert with the First Slayer, Buffy realizes that she does not have to be entirely <b>alone,</b> <b>that</b> it is her closeness to friends and family that makes her a great Slayer, and once she experiences this revelation, the efforts of the First Slayer to continue to engage her in battle become fruitless and increasingly comical. The dream finally ends in a mundane way, as Buffy refuses to accept a tragic climax and instead insists on normality in her life.|$|E

25|$|Protestant teaching, {{originating}} with Martin Luther, {{teaches that}} salvation is received by grace <b>alone</b> and <b>that</b> one's sole necessary {{response to this}} grace is faith alone. Older Christian teaching, as found in Catholic and Orthodox theology, is that salvation is received by grace <b>alone,</b> but <b>that</b> one's necessary response to this grace comprises both faith and works (James 2:24,26; Rom 2:6–7; Gal 5:6).|$|R
25|$|The {{main reasons}} for the {{eventual}} failure were structural. This alliance was only valued {{out of fear of}} Sparta, which evaporated after Sparta's fall in 371 BC, losing the alliance its sole 'raison d'etre'. The Athenians no longer had the means to fulfill their ambitions, and found it difficult merely to finance their own navy, let <b>alone</b> <b>that</b> of an entire alliance, and so could not properly defend their allies. Thus, the tyrant of Pherae was able to destroy a number of cities with impunity. From 360 BC, Athens lost its reputation for invincibility and a number of allies (such as Byzantium and Naxos in 364 BC) decided to secede.|$|E
25|$|In admixture, the {{combined}} solubility of ammonium nitrate and urea {{is so much}} {{higher than that of}} either component <b>alone</b> <b>that</b> it is possible to obtain a stable solution (known as UAN) with a total nitrogen content (32%) approaching that of solid ammonium nitrate (33.5%), though not, of course, that of urea itself (46%). Given the ongoing safety and security concerns surrounding fertilizer-grade solid ammonium nitrate, UAN provides a considerably safer alternative without entirely sacrificing the agronomic properties that make ammonium nitrate more attractive than urea as a fertilizer in areas with short growing seasons. It is also more convenient to store and handle than a solid product and easier to apply accurately to the land by mechanical means.|$|E
25|$|Justification {{by faith}} alone (sola fide) {{states that it}} is by grace through faith <b>alone</b> <b>that</b> Christians receive {{salvation}} and not through any works of their own (see Ephesians 2:8, Romans 3:23). Open Brethren have {{a strong emphasis on}} the concept of salvation. The brethren teach that the consequence of human sin is condemnation to eternal death in hell. Christ's death on the cross paid sin's penalty and his resurrection is evidence that eternal life is available to any who will have it. The only requirements are that each individual willfully repents of sin, accepts the substitutionary payment of his own sin by faith in Christ's death, and declares that Jesus is Lord (see John 3:14–18 and Acts 10:34–43).|$|E

25|$|Saadia Gaon's {{commentary}} on the Bible bears the stamp of the Mutazilites; and its author, while not admitting any positive attributes of God, except these of essence, endeavors to interpret Biblical passages {{in such a way}} as to rid them of anthropomorphism. The Jewish commentator, Abraham ibn Ezra, explains the Biblical account of Creation and other Scriptural passages in a philosophical sense. Nahmanides (Rabbi Moshe ben Nahman), too, and other commentators, show the influence of the philosophical ideas current in their respective epochs.
