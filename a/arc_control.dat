40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} use of a modern welding power source {{equipped}} with advanced <b>arc</b> <b>control</b> functions. At the Laboratory of Welding Technologies of CTU in Prague we have focused on GMAW welding of steel using Sigma Galaxy, a modern welding power source produced by Migatronic. Sigma Galaxy is equipped with functions called Intelligent <b>Arc</b> <b>Control</b> and Sequence Repeat. According to the manufacturer, controlling an arc by these functions should significantly stabilize the welding process, lower the heat input and the deformation, and improve the weld quality. To evaluate the benefits of these functions completely, single V butt welds were performed on S 275 J 2 structural steel 10 mm in thickness (2 weld layers: root+capping layer) in PF and PG positions. Welding was monitored by the Welding Information System, and was compared with standard GMAW welding. The results have shown that these “intelligent” functions offer significant advantages for steel welding, especially in vertical and overhead positions, because they lower the heat input and improve the weld metal control...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} optimum load control of steam power plants has been dealt within many {{technical}} papers {{during the last}} decades. Deregulation of the power markets {{and close to the}} (bio-) fuel source thinking has lead to a trend of small scale combined heat and power plants. These plants are usually operated according to the heat demand and therefore they spend a significant time on partial load. The load control of such plants is in general done by partial <b>arc</b> <b>control.</b> This work applies a hybrid control strategy, which is a combination of partial <b>arc</b> <b>control</b> and sliding pressure control. The method achieves further improvement in performance at partial load. Hybrid control itself is not novel and has earlier been used on traditional coal-fired condensing plants. This has, to the author's knowledge, not earlier been applied on combined heat and power plants. The results show that there is a potential for improved electricity production at {{a significant part of the}} load range. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

30|$|Following {{the first}} {{classification}} of arc types in 1976 (Lancaster 1984), several further classifications have been proposed. Short arc, globular arc, and spray arc {{are the three}} major classifications of arc types by the American Welding Society (AWS) (Iordachescu and Quintino 2008). The International Institute of Welding (IIW), in 1984, divided spray arc types into the three categories: (i) drop spray or projected spray, (ii) rotating spray, and (iii) streaming spray (Iordachescu and Quintino 2008; Lancaster 1986). Norrish (2003) and then Ponomarev et al. (2003) modified this categorization. Utilization of digital control of power sources has led to many improvements in <b>arc</b> <b>control,</b> especially in welding with short and pulsed arcs.

40|$|Abstract. DC Vacuum Circuit Breakers based <b>arc</b> <b>control</b> {{has been}} a major topic in the last few decades.

40|$|Distributed {{computing}} resources available for high-energy physics research are becoming less dedicated to {{one type of}} workflow and researchers’ workloads are increasingly exploiting modern computing technologies such as parallelism. The current pilot job management model used by many experiments relies on static dedicated resources and cannot easily adapt to these changes.

Rather than a fixed set of resources managed centrally, the model allows resources to be requested on the fly. The ARC Computing Element (ARC-CE) and <b>ARC</b> <b>Control</b> Tower (aCT) are the key components of the model.

40|$|SummaryLeptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, acts on {{hypothalamic}} neurons {{located in}} the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus to regulate energy homeostasis. One of the leptin-regulated neuronal subtypes in the ARC are agouti-related peptide (AgRP) -expressing neurons, which {{are involved in the}} regulation of food intake and are directly inhibited by leptin. Leptin activates the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat 3), but the role of Stat 3 in the regulation of AgRP neurons is unclear. Here we show that mice expressing a constitutively active version of Stat 3 selectively in AgRP neurons are lean and exhibit relative resistance to diet-induced obesity. Surprisingly, this phenotype arises from increased locomotor activity in the presence of unaltered AgRP expression.

The resulting ARC controller achieves a prescribed transient performance and final tracking accuracy in general; the exponential conver-gence rate of the transient tracking error and the bound of the final tracking error can be adjusted via certain con-troller parameters in a known form. In addition, in the presence of parametric uncertainties only, if the true pa-rameters fall within the design bound, asymptotic output tracking is achieved. Furthermore, by choosing the design bound appropriately, the controller also has a well-designed built-in anti-integration windup mechanism to alleviate the effect of control saturation.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new model for cogging forces of linear motor systems. Sinusoidal {{functions}} of positions are used to effectively capture the largely periodic nature of cogging forces with respect to position, while B-spline functions are employed {{to account for the}} additional aperiodic part of cogging forces. This model is experimentally demonstrated to be able to capture both the periodic and nonperiodic characteristics of cogging force while having a linear parametrization form, which makes the online adaptive compensation of cogging forces possible and effective. A discontinuous-projection-based desired compensation adaptive robust controller (DCARC) is then constructed, which makes full use of the proposed cogging force model for an improved cogging force compensation. Comparative experimental results with various cogging force compensations are obtained on both axes of a linear-motor-driven industrial gantry. The results show that DCARC with the proposed model compensation achieves the best tracking performance among all the three algorithms tested, validating the proposed cogging force model. The excellent tracking performances obtained in the experiments also verify the effectiveness of the proposed <b>ARC</b> <b>control</b> algorithms in practical applications.

Adaptive robust control (ARC) of MIMO nonlinear systems transformable to two semi-strict feedback forms are considered.

Here we {{demonstrate that}} Arc targets AMPAR to be internalized through a direct {{interaction with the}} clathrin-adaptor protein 2 (AP- 2). We show that Arc overexpression overexpression in dissociated hippocampal neurons obtained from C 57 BL/ 6 mouse reduces the density of AMPAR GluA 1 subunits at the cell surface and reduces the amplitude and rectification of AMPAR-mediated miniature-excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC). Mutations of Arc, that prevent the AP- 2 interaction reduce Arc-mediated endocytosis of GluA 1 and abolish the reduction in AMPAR-mediated mEPSC amplitude and rectification. Depletion of the AP- 2 subunit µ 2 blocks the Arc-mediated reduction in mEPSC amplitude, effect that is restored by re-introducing µ 2. The Arc/AP- 2 interaction {{plays an important role}} in homeostatic synaptic scaling as the Arc-dependent decrease in mEPSC amplitude, induced by a chronic increase in neuronal activity, is inhibited by AP- 2 depletion.

Although equatorward migration of the STF and reduction in Agulhas leakage were reported during the last glacial period, the fate of ARC during the last glacial–interglacial cycle is not clear. Therefore, in order to understand changes in the position and {{strength of}} ARC during the last glacial–interglacial cycle, here we reconstruct hydrographic changes in the southwestern Indian Ocean from temporal variation in planktic foraminiferal abundance, stable isotopic ratio (δ 18 O) and trace elemental ratio (Mg/Ca) of planktic foraminifera Globigerina bulloides in a core collected from the Agulhas Recirculation Region (ARR) in the southwestern Indian Ocean. Increased abundance of G. bulloides suggests that the productivity in the southwestern Indian Ocean increased during the last glacial period which confirms previous reports of high glacial productivity in the Southern Ocean. The increased productivity was likely driven by the intensified Southern Hemisphere westerlies supported by an equatorward migration of the subtropical front. Increase in relative abundance of Neogloboquadrina incompta suggests seasonally strong thermocline and enhanced advection of southern source water in the southwestern Indian Ocean as a result of strengthened ARC, right through MIS 4 to MIS 2, during the last glacial period. Therefore, it is inferred that over the last glacial–interglacial cycle, the hydrography of the southwestern Indian Ocean was driven by strengthened westerlies, ARC as well as a migrating subtropical front...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—High-performance robust {{motion control}} of single-rod {{hydraulic}} actuators with constant unknown inertia load is considered. In {{contrast to the}} double-rod hydraulic actuators studied previously, the two chambers of a single-rod hydraulic actuator have different areas. As a result, the dynamic equations describing the pressure changes in the two chambers cannot be combined into a single load pressure equation. This complicates the controller design since it not only increases the dimension of the system {{to be dealt with}} but also brings in the stability issue of the added internal dynamics. A discontinuous projection-based adaptive robust controller (ARC) is constructed. The controller is able to take into account not only the effect of parameter variations coming from the inertia load and various hydraulic parameters but also the effect of hard-to-model nonlinearities such as uncompensated friction forces and external disturbances. The controller guarantees a prescribed output tracking transient performance and final tracking accuracy in general while achieving asymptotic output tracking in the presence of parametric uncertainties. In addition, the zero error dynamics for tracking any nonzero constant velocity trajectory is shown to be globally uniformly stable. Extensive experimental results are obtained for the swing motion control of a hydraulic arm and verify the high-performance nature of the proposed <b>ARC</b> <b>control</b> strategy. In comparison to a state-of-the-art industrial motion controller, the proposed ARC algorithm achieves more than a magnitude reduction of tracking errors. Furthermore, during the constant velocity portion of the motion, the ARC controller reduces the tracking errors almost down to the measurement resolution level.

40|$|Electrical {{discharges}} {{have been}} used extensively in devices for interruption of fault currents. Much work has investigated the use of arc discharges for interrupting DC current. The problem with DC current {{is that there is}} no natural current zero where thermal losses from the arc dominate thus leading to arc extinction and the interruption of fault current. Helical arc been arranged by using splitter blades to separate the arc turns. The expansion of a helical arc confined between polymeric splitter blades is governed by both electromagnetic and aerodynamic forces. These arise due to the complex interaction between the individual arc turns, arc/ splitter blade interactions and surrounding media. These interactions can be exploited to control the rate of expansion. During this expansion stage there is a substantial increase in arc voltage which in low voltage systems can limit the current thereby causing current interruption providing the arc quenching conditions are suitable. An experimental study has been undertaken to assess the fundamental characteristics of helical arcs con�fined between �different arrangements of PTFE, PE and copper blades in three different sizes (180 mm, 360 mm and 500 mm). Significant improvements in arc current limitation and interruption capability are observed when the arc voltage increases. A substantial increase in arc voltage was observed for all combinations of copper/ PTFE splitter blades. It was noted that the prospective fault current is forced to near zero when copper blades are used in conjunction with PTFE blades. With the larger PTFE and PE blades sized 360 mm and 500 mm, it was observed that the arc stayed within the limit of blades, thus providing better <b>arc</b> <b>control</b> capability. Simplified modelling of the forces acting on the arc (electromagnetic, aerodynamic) have been assessed. The electromagnetic forces act not only to produce radial expansion of the arc but also to keep alignment between the turns. The generation of the aerodynamic forces is very complex to model and indeed the modelling presented can only be used indicatively in any analysis at this stage. The work indicates that a compact DC interruption device may be possible based on the confinement of the plasma within the splitter blades and interaction with polymeric material...|$|E
