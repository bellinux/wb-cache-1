But we have agreed to bring two of them up now to cook and wash, and leave the others to look arter the place and the kids. Simpson and Jones ain't married, you know. Women have a right to claims as well as men, and of course we shall take up for those we bring up, as well as for two big lads; so that will give us ten claims, besides the extra claims for discovery. So with your five claims we can get hold of a tidy bit of ground.

40|$|An {{aspect of}} the {{diffusion}} of American popular culture is examined in this research drawing upon national survey data. Measuring Australiansâ€™ knowledge of American and Australian outlaws, we found that Jesse James <b>and</b> Billy <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>are</b> better known in Australia {{than any of the}} local outlaws, or bushrangers, with the exception of Ned Kelly. While a relatively large proportion of Australians identified Ned Kelly, Ben Hall, Jesse James <b>and</b> Billy <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> as outlaws, few identified other Australian â€˜outlawsâ€™. Social background and political ideology is associated with greater knowledge of outlaws. Men, baby boomers and their predecessors, those born in Australia or the UK, those with a basic secondary level education and those identifying as left on the political spectrum are the most knowledgeable. This Australian study suggests that outlaws such as Jesse James <b>and</b> Billy <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>are</b> not just national folk heroes, but recognised globally. Promoted by visual and print media they have transcended their outlaw heritage to represent romanticised notions of freedom, loyalty <b>and</b> <b>the</b> â€˜underdogâ€™, regardless of the historical facts surrounding their lives and deaths...|$|R
