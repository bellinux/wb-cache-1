30|$|Three {{different}} types of triaxial tests were performed: (1) pore pressure stepping tests at variable pore pressure conditions. During the pore pressure stepping tests, the confining pressure (σ 3) was held constant at 55 and 65  MPa, respectively. The pore pressure was decreased in three steps from 80 % to 50 % and 25 % of the confining pressure or from 90 % to 60 % and 30 % of the confining pressure, respectively. This allowed examining the peak strength at different effective confining pressure conditions. (2) In the confining pressure stepping tests, deformation tests were conducted at up to five different confining pressures. In these tests, the confining pressure was increased in each deformation phase in 10 -MPa steps up to five times from 25 to 65  MPa, while the pore pressure was generally 80 % of the confining pressure.

30|$|The {{effective}} shear parameters were determined using Mohr Circle constructions, stress path constructions (p′-q′ diagram), and estimations from fracture angles. The first two methods {{use the same}} experimental values (Figures  3 and 4; Table  3). Differences in the {{effective shear}} parameters determined by these methods are small (Table  3) and may result from the different fit of the tangent to the Mohr Circles and the fit of the regression line to the stress maxima. Shear parameters determined from the fracture angles on the same samples differ to a slightly larger extent. Since we conducted up to five experimental steps using single samples (see the ‘Methods’ section), maximum shear stresses {{at the moment of}} failure cannot be exactly determined; thus, any results from the computations have to be considered as close approximations of the real values. The fracture angle method, on the other hand, is more prone to measurement errors, and fracture angles in some cases have irregular geometries and show multiple fracturing (see, e.g., Additional file 1 : Figure S 2 B). One further effect on fracture angles may be exercised by sample length. Additional file 1 : Figure S 2 B shows that dimensions of the sample cylinders are just sufficient to ensure pervasive shear failure of the samples, so that boundary effects cannot be ruled out completely. Unfortunately, it was impossible to produce samples for the testing with length-diameter ratios much larger than 2, which is desirable for triaxial testing. As a result, fracture angles (Figure  5) may be somewhat lower than in experiments with unconstrained sample length, leading to an underestimation <b>of</b> <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>internal</b> <b>friction</b> and overestimation <b>of</b> cohesion. This is reflected in the results for most samples (compare values in Table  3). Finally, fracture angles may also be influenced by fabric anisotropy, such as the preferred alignment of sheet silicates, and reactivation of pre-existing microfractures and joints. This, however, is an effect that should be equally evident in the results of shear parameter computations, as anisotropy is an intrinsic property that influences rock friction and the energetics of fracture formation.|$|R
