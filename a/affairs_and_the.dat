5|$|DuMont {{programs}} were by necessity low-budget <b>affairs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> network received relatively few awards from the TV industry. Most awards during the 1950s went to NBC and CBS, {{who were able}} to out-spend other companies and draw on their extensive history of radio broadcasting in the relatively new television medium. DuMont, however, did win a number of awards during its years of operation.|$|E

The transitional constitution was still in effect, which meant the president was elected by government ministers and the national assembly rather than by a direct election.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1236, the Mongol prince Kublai, {{who later}} ruled as Khagan from 1260–1294, {{was granted a}} large appanage in North China by his superior, Ögedei Khan. Karma Pakshi, 2nd Karmapa Lama (1203–1283)—the head lama of the Karma Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism—rejected Kublai's invitation, so instead Kublai invited Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235–1280), {{successor}} and nephew of Sakya Pandita, who came to his court in 1253. Kublai instituted a unique relationship with the Phagpa lama, which recognized Kublai as a superior sovereign in political <b>affairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Phagpa lama as the senior instructor to Kublai in religious affairs. Kublai also made Drogön Chögyal Phagpa {{the director of the}} government agency known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan <b>Affairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ruling priest-king of Tibet, which comprised thirteen different states ruled by myriarchies.|$|E

5|$|Between 1997 and 2000 Mosley {{repeatedly}} {{warned that}} if any EU decision went against the FIA, the marketing organisations and F1 itself would be moved out of Europe. In 1999, the EU Commission Directorate-General for Competition issued a Statement of Objections, listing a number of grievances surrounding the FIA's dealings with Ecclestone and Formula One. The FIA released the Statement {{to the media and}} held a press conference in Brussels ridiculing the Commission’s case. The Commission argued that a number of commercial agreements could be viewed as anti-competition and invited the FIA and Ecclestone's companies, ISC and FOA, to submit proposals to modify these arrangements. In 2001, nine months after settlement talks had begun, the parties reached an agreement to amend existing contracts, which included Ecclestone stepping down as the FIA's vice-president of promotional <b>affairs</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> FIA ending all involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One.|$|E
