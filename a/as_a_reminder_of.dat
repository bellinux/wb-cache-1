It can trace its origins back to the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN).|$|E
5|$|According to Christian theologian Gordon J. Wenham, {{the purpose}} of kashrut was to help Jews {{maintain}} a distinct and separate existence from other peoples; {{he says that the}} effect of the laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted. Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> their distinct status as Jews.|$|E
5|$|Between 1873 and 1875, mineowners Fletcher Burrows built a small {{model village}} at Howe Bridge, {{comprising}} cottages, shops, a village club, and a bath house for their employees. This Victorian village {{on either side}} of Leigh Road, together with St Michael and All Angel's Church, is a conservation area.

5|$|Kent Ridge Park, Labrador Park, {{and the war}} museum, {{are part}} of the Pasir Panjang Historic District, which focuses on World War II {{battlefield}} events in western Singapore.

Near {{to the top of the}} ridge, there is a commemorative heritage site marker which shows the area where the Battle of Pasir Panjang of 1942 was fought.|$|E
5|$|Mount Osmond {{contains}} {{a number of}} historical attractions; notably in the former mines and mining infrastructure that remains on the hillside <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> its past. The mines continue up throughout the hills from Glen Osmond. While Wheal Gawler and Wheal Watkins are former open-cut mines (located in Glen Osmond), Mount Osmond contains more mineshafts which are up to sixty metres deep.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{anti-ice}} {{was turned}} {{on for the}} two engines during taxi. The captain announced to passengers that the flaps would remain up during taxi, and {{they should not be}} worried seeing them in the retracted position. He placed an empty coffee cup on the flap handle <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the position of the flaps, a procedure used by many flight crews. The captain told the first officer they would use standard USAir contaminated runway procedures that included the use of 18 degrees flaps, and also decided that they would take off with a reduced V1 speed of 110 knots.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Sunderland {{moved to}} their present ground, Stadium of Light in Monkwearmouth, which was opened by Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Built with an {{original}} capacity of 42,000, it hosted its first game against Dutch team Ajax. The stadium bears a similar {{name to the}} Portuguese club Benfica's ground Estádio da Luz, albeit in a different language. Stadium expansion in 2000 saw the capacity increase to 49,000. A Davy lamp monument stands outside the stadium, and a miners banner {{was presented to the}} club by the Durham Miners' Association, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the Monkwearmouth Colliery pit the stadium was built on.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} era, {{the park was}} long known chiefly for its {{isolated}} location and primitive camping facilities. In August 1952it played host to the first Woodsmen's Carnival, an annual celebration of the lumbering industry, which was again active in the second growth forests in the area. The festival, originally sponsored by the Penn-York Lumbermen's Club, features lumberjack competitions <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the past, as well as displays of new equipment. In 1987the Galeton Rotary Club took over sponsorship, and renamed the event the Woodsmen's Show in 1990.|$|E
5|$|A {{vigorous}} tropical wave {{moved off}} the western coast of Africa on September11 {{and almost immediately}} {{led to the formation}} of a tropical depression by 06:00UTC the next day. Steered in a traditional west-northwest fashion, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Julia twelve hours later and continued steady strengthening to become a hurricane by 12:00UTC September14. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> limited hurricane intensity forecasting skill, the system began a period of rapid intensification thereafter, attaining peak winds of 140mph (220km/h) by 12:00UTC on September15. Julia became the easternmost Category4 hurricane on record in the Atlantic as a result. After peak, the system recurved around a ridge while simultaneously weakening under influence of Hurricane Igor's outflow. It fell back to tropical storm intensity by 00:00UTC on September18 and degenerated into a remnant low by 18:00UTC on September20 while located about 1,095mi (1,760km) west of the Azores. The remnant low turned back west, dissipating late on September24.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from being}} an {{obligatory}} religious duty, the Hajj is seen to have a spiritual merit that provides the Muslims with an opportunity of self-renewal. Hajj serves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the Day of Judgment when Muslims believe people will stand before God. Hadith literature (sayings of Muhammad) articulates various merits a pilgrim achieves upon successful completion of their Hajj. After successful pilgrimage, pilgrims can prefix their names with the title 'Al-Hajji', and are held with respect in Muslim society. However, Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim's religious commitment, {{and should not be}} a measurement of their social status. Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from {{different parts of the world}} irrespective of their race, colour, and culture, which acts as a symbol of equality.|$|E
5|$|Barry is {{described}} as the most famous St. Bernard by the Natural History Museum of Bern. Following his death, his skin was preserved by a taxidermist for the museum, {{while the rest of}} his body was buried. He was originally given a humble and meek pose, as the taxidermist felt that this would serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> servitude to future generations. In 1923, his body was refurbished by Georg Ruprecht, as his coat had become brittle and had broken into more than 20 pieces. During the restoration, his body was re-posed and his skull shape was modified to match the shape of the St. Bernard of that time, in a compromise between Ruprecht and the Museum's director. His original head shape was rather flat with a moderate stop, with the modification resulting in a larger head with a more pronounced stop. A barrel was added hanging from his collar, following the popularization of the myth of the monastery's dogs using these during the rescues, which was originally introduced by Edwin Landseer's work Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveller. The barrel was removed in 1978 by Professor Walter Huber, the director of the museum, although it has since been replaced. A monument to Barry is located opposite the entrance to the Cimetière des Chiens in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Before her stasis {{aboard the}} Spear of Adun, Rohana was a driven protoss {{who was not}} afraid to seek out tasks others thought impossible. She {{displayed}} strict adherence to tradition, yet was creative {{when faced with the}} issues. After she was awakened, Rohana held on to the old ways of the Protoss Empire, openly speaking out against her Nerazim crew, Artanis' Terran allies, and the reawakening of the Purifiers. She served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> the past, clinging to old traditions and ways, and refusing to cut her connection from the Khala even as Amon continued to possess her, stating knowledge and history {{was the only thing that}} brought unity to the protoss. Though Artanis valued her memories and her ability to see into Amon's thoughts, he began to grow weary of her adherence to the old ways and her objections to his choices, becoming more of a critic than a councilor. Eventually, she came to terms with the Daelaam, and cut herself from the Khala, stating that perhaps history did not need to be recorded with perfect clarity.|$|E

5|$|After {{his army}} crossed the Euphrates, {{following}} a route opened up by Lucullus {{over a hundred}} years before, he received envoys from Tiridates and Vologases. At the approach of such a large force, and aware of Corbulo's ability as a general, the two Arsacids were anxious to negotiate. Indeed, Corbulo, no doubt on instructions from Nero, reiterated the old Roman position: if Tiridates would accept his crown from Rome, then renewed war could be averted. Tiridates readily agreed to negotiations, and Rhandeia, the scene of last year's Roman defeat, was agreed upon as a meeting place. To the Armenians, this place was intended <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>of</b> their strength, while Corbulo agreed to it because there he hoped to expunge the earlier disgrace, by peace or war. Once there, Corbulo put Paetus' son, who served under him as a legate, in charge of a party that was to gather the remains of the Roman soldiers and ensure them a proper burial. On the agreed day, both Tiridates and Corbulo, each accompanied by 20 horsemen, met between the two camps. Tiridates agreed to travel to Rome and seek confirmation of his crown from Nero. In sign of this agreement, a few days later, both armies put on a display, arrayed in full parade gear. Tiridates approached the Roman camp, where a statue of the Emperor Nero had been erected upon a raised platform, and placed his royal diadem at its feet in submission.|$|E
