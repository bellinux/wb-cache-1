5|$|Childhood <b>and</b> <b>adolescence</b> {{allows the}} {{development}} of an internal working model useful for forming attachments. This internal working model is related to the individual's state of mind which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on childhood and adolescent experience. The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those who rely more on the individual's state of mind alone in forming new attachments.|$|E

Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript {{in a fit of}} rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A Künstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood <b>and</b> <b>adolescence</b> of protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.|$|E

5|$|Severe {{childhood}} {{trauma is}} {{also associated with}} a general increase {{in the risk of}} drug dependency. Lack of peer and family support is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism developing. Genetics <b>and</b> <b>adolescence</b> are associated with an increased sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse. Cortical degeneration due to the neurotoxic effects increases impulsive behaviour, which may contribute to the development, persistence and severity of alcohol use disorders. There is evidence that with abstinence, there is a reversal of {{at least some of the}} alcohol induced central nervous system damage. The use of cannabis was associated with later problems with alcohol use. Alcohol use was associated with an increased probability of later use of tobacco, cannabis, and other illegal drugs.|$|E

5|$|The {{phonology}} {{of words}} {{has proven to}} be beneficial to vocabulary development when children begin school. Once children have developed a vocabulary, they utilize the sounds that they already know to learn new words. The phonological loop encodes, maintains and manipulates speech-based information that a person encounters. This information is then stored in the phonological memory, a part of short term memory. Research shows that children's capacities in the area of phonological memory are linked to vocabulary knowledge when children first begin school at age 4–5 years old. As memory capabilities tend to increase with age (between age 4 <b>and</b> <b>adolescence),</b> so does an individual's ability to learn more complex vocabulary.|$|E
5|$|William {{was the son}} of the {{unmarried}} Robert I, Duke of Normandy, by Robert's mistress Herleva. His illegitimate {{status and}} his youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy that plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood <b>and</b> <b>adolescence,</b> members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke and for their own ends. In 1047 William was able to quash a rebellion and begin to establish his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to Matilda of Flanders provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of Flanders. By the time of his marriage, William was able to arrange the appointments of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and by 1062 William was able to secure control of the neighbouring county of Maine.|$|E

40|$|Three {{questions}} {{were examined in}} this study: (a) What is the course of emotional disturbance <b>and</b> delinquency during <b>adolescence</b> <b>and</b> young adulthood? (b) To what extent do emotional disturbance and delinquency co-occur during <b>adolescence</b> <b>and</b> young adulthood? and (c) What are the longitudinal associations between emotional disturbance and delinquency in different age and gender categories during <b>adolescence</b> <b>and</b> young adulthood? Data were used from a national sample of 1, 302 adolescents and young adults, who participated in a 6 -year 3 -wave longitudinal study. Findings showed an increase of emotional disturbance and delinquency from early to midadolescence, after which emotional disturbance stabilized and delinquency declined into young adulthood. A significant but relatively weak co-occurrence of emotional disturbance and delinquency was found. Multigroup LISREL analyses demonstrated that a stability model with no cross-lagged relations fit best for the total sample, and across age and gender categories. Thus, co-occurrence of emotional disturbance <b>and</b> delinquency during <b>adolescence</b> <b>and</b> young adulthood seems to result from associated but separate psychopathological processes. The strong stability of internalizing and externalizing behavior suggests that prevention efforts should be aimed at children and young adolescents...|$|R
