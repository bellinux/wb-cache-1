5|$|Victoria was {{physically}} unprepossessing—she was stout, dowdy and only <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> tall—but she succeeded in projecting a grand image. She experienced unpopularity {{during the first}} years of her widowhood, but was well liked during the 1880s and 1890s, when she embodied the empire as a benevolent matriarchal figure. Only after the release of her diary and letters did the extent of her political influence become known to the wider public. Biographies of Victoria written before much of the primary material became available, such as Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria of 1921, are now considered out of date. The biographies written by Elizabeth Longford and Cecil Woodham-Smith, in 1964 and 1972 respectively, are still widely admired. They, and others, conclude that as a person Victoria was emotional, obstinate, honest, and straight-talking.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the crashed plane, in which Hank discovers a dead pilot and the $4.4 million in cash, was filmed on a soundstage. A second plane, designed to have frosted windows, was attached to a gimbal, <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> off the ground. To match the interior with footage shot in Wisconsin, the art department built a set with real trees and a painted backdrop. To depict Hank being attacked by a flock of crows inside the plane, puppets were used to attack Paxton as he appeared on screen, while two live crows were used to attack an animatronic replica of the actor. A separate soundstage was used to create two sets depicting the interiors of the Mitchell home, where Hank and his wife Sarah (Fonda) reside. The first set was the main floor an exterior entrance way, and the second was created for the upstairs bedrooms. Principal photography concluded on March 13, 1998, after 55 days of filming.|$|E

25|$|Briggs was a notably {{short man}} at <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> five or 165 centimetres. Briggs's skill {{lay in his}} ability to vary the flight and pace of the ball as well as in {{achieving}} prodigious spin on the primitive pitches of the nineteenth century. As a batsman, Briggs was capable of hitting very effectively, but as time went by an eagerness to punish every ball set in and led to a decline.|$|E
25|$|Tamboo-bamboo bands {{consist of}} three {{different}} instruments (each cut from bamboo): boom, foulé, and cutter. The boom serves as the bass instrument, is usually <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> long, and is played by stamping it on the ground. The foulé, a higher-pitched instrument, consists of two pieces of bamboo, each about a foot long, and is played by striking these pieces end to end. The cutter, the highest-pitched instrument in the ensemble, is made from a thinner piece of bamboo (of varying length) and is struck with a stick. These three types of instruments combined to beat out rhythms that accompanied the chantwells and were a staple of carnival celebrations for many years. They were gradually rendered obsolete by the steel band.|$|E

His dress consisted of a loose robe of yellow silk, a cap of black velvet with a red ball on the top, and adorned with a peacock's feather, which is the peculiar distinction of mandarins of the first class. He wore silk boots embroidered with gold, and a sash of blue girded his waist.|$|E
5000|$|As {{part of the}} Eastbourne Ancestors project, 300 sets {{of human}} remains {{excavated}} from Saxon cemeteries were re-examined. Heritage Officer Jo Seaman and her team found two boxes labelled [...] "Beachy Head, {{something to do with}} 1956 or 1959". Inside they found a very well-preserved human skeleton.

25|$|Joe H. Gill and his {{engineering}} friends thoughtfully considered {{how to make}} {{a holiday}} of April Fool's Day. After an unsuccessful attempt involving tying cans around dogs' tails and releasing them to disrupt class, the group of students saw a wooden statue <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> high while getting refreshments, which they requested to borrow. The next day, Gill presented the statue as their patron saint and traced his ancestry back to ancient times between classes. The presentation successfully broke up classes, and led to his christening as Alexander Frederick Claire, patron saint of UT engineers, exactly one year later. Alec {{was at the center of}} a friendly rivalry between law and engineering students for many years, and was subject to numerous escapades such as kidnappings and amputations. Today, what is left of the original wooden statue is safely preserved in the engineering library.|$|E
500|$|No {{contemporary}} portrait exists of Turpin, who as {{a notorious}} but unremarkable figure was not considered sufficiently important to be immortalised. [...] An engraving in one edition of Bayes' 1739 publication, of a man hiding in a cave, is sometimes supposed to be him, but the closest description that exists is that given by John Wheeler, of [...] "a fresh coloured man, very much marked with the small pox, <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> nine inches high... wears a blue grey coat and a light coloured wig". [...] An E-FIT of Turpin, created from such reports, was published by the Castle Museum in York in 2009.|$|E
500|$|Three {{days later}} Turpin, {{accompanied}} by the same men along with William Saunders and Humphrey Walker, brutally raided a farm in Marylebone. [...] The attack netted the gang just under £90. [...] The next day the Duke of Newcastle offered a reward of £50 in exchange {{for information leading to}} the conviction of the [...] "several persons" [...] involved in the two Woodford robberies, and the robberies of the widow Shelley and Reverend Dyde. [...] On 11February Fielder, Saunders, and Wheeler, were apprehended. [...] Two accounts of their capture exist. [...] One claims that on their way to rob the Lawrence household the gang had stopped at an alehouse in Edgware, and that on 11February, while out walking, the owner noticed a group of horses outside an alehouse in Bloomsbury. [...] He recognised these horses as those used by the same group of men who had stopped at his alehouse before the Lawrence attack, and called for the parish constable. [...] Another account claims that two of the gang were spotted by a servant of Joseph Lawrence. [...] Regardless, the three, who were drinking with a woman (possibly Mary Brazier) were promptly arrested and committed to prison. [...] Wheeler, who may have been as young as15, quickly betrayed his colleagues, and descriptions of those yet to be captured were circulated in the press. [...] In the London Gazette, Turpin was described as [...] "Richard Turpin, a butcher by trade, is a tall fresh coloured man, very much marked with the small pox, about 26 years of age, <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> nine inches high, lived some time ago in Whitechapel and did lately lodge somewhere about Millbank, Westminster, wears a blue grey coat and a natural wig".|$|E

50|$|In July 1968, McCune {{obtained}} an {{iron and}} steel Albion press, manufactured in London in 1852 by Hopkinson & Cope, the latter having invented it around 1820. The machine stood approximately six feet six inches in height and weighed just under 2,000 pounds. Because it was so large and McCune was only <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>foot</b> six, he had a platform built on which he could stand to operate the press. The plumed finial on top frequently sported a beret {{to add to the}} informality of McCune’s printing operation.|$|R
500|$|Unlike the Browns, the Braves were contenders {{all the way}} to the end of the 1948 season. In a {{game against}} the Philadelphia Phillies on 3 September, and with the Braves tied for the NL lead, Heath hit a two-run home run and the Braves went on to win the game, 3–1, and stayed in first place for the {{remainder}} of the regular season. With the Braves up five games in the NL standings and four games remaining on their regular season schedule, the Braves had a match-up with the Brooklyn Dodgers on 29 September but according to teammate Clint Conatser, Heath asked Braves manager Billy Southworth for the night off but his request was denied. During the game, Heath attempted to score from second base and slid towards home plate to try and beat the tag by Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella. As he slid, his foot got caught in the dirt which caused his ankle to twist. [...] "I began to slide <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> from the plate. Funny thing, I generally get my spikes up off the ground, but this time I didn't. I looked at my foot, which was twisted all the way around, and honestly I thought it would come right off", Heath said the next day from a local hospital. After playing in the majors for parts of 12 years, he would be forced to miss the World Series as it was later diagnosed he fractured his ankle. He called the broken ankle [...] "the biggest disappointment of my life." [...] A widely published newspaper photograph of the play showed Heath sliding toward the plate, mouth open in shock, with his leg bent mid-ankle with the lower ankle rotated ninety degrees to the upper ankle. He was quoted asking himself [...] "Why did I slide?" [...] when he was carried off the field on a stretcher and later put in an ambulance. In 1964, Heath said: ...|$|E

[...] Contemporary sources described Sharkey as handsome, well-dressed, interesting, and confident. Sharkey decided {{at an early age}} to adopt the “flash life” of a burglar, pickpocket, gambler, and “sporting man.” Sharkey's gang, the Sharkey Guard, was described as “a gang of young gentlemen of questionable habits.” ...|$|R

2500|$|Catastroffiti, {{a form of}} {{graffiti}} {{related to}} natural disasters, starts to appear as affected residents gut their houses, placing damaged materials on the berms. [...] At first, this graffiti was placed on trashed appliances to prevent theft and resale, but soon expanded in medium and purpose. [...] The graffiti done mostly in spray paint (also mud) started to not only be a precaution, but a dialogue of emotions related {{to the effects of}} the flood. [...] Post-flood emotions driving this largely consisted of frustration with the National Weather Service after it predicted a flood crest <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>feet</b> less than the actual. [...] As this developed, catastroffiti was appearing on not just household appliances, but also houses, garages, and signs. [...] In the aftermath of the 1997 Red River Flood, catastroffiti became a method of commentary and coping in the affected areas.|$|E
