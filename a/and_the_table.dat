5|$|By mid-1944, the M3 {{had fallen}} out of favor even with {{airborne}} troops, despite their strong preference for compact and lightweight weapon systems. The Airborne Command had rejected the 57mm M1 in the summer of 1943 claiming its unfitness for airlifting <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> of Organisation and Equipment (TO) of February 1944 still had airborne divisions keeping their 37mm guns. Nevertheless, the 82nd and the 101st, were reequipped with British-manufactured 6-pounder gun (57mm) on carriage Mk III (designed to fit into the British Horsa glider) for the Normandy airdrops. This change was officially introduced in the TO of December 1944.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the area}} {{commenced}} immediately and in 1872 the Table Rock Post Office was established just south of Upper Table Rock and east of Lower Table Rock. The Table Rock School District was created in 1879. In 1895 the post office's name was changed to Tablerock, and it was closed in 1906. Telephones arrived in 1908, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> Rock Mutual Telephone Company was established. The school district was merged with Central Point's district in 1948.|$|E

When Arnold was incapacitated by a heart attack in May, Hansell acted as de facto commander of the Twentieth Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that rests on a {{frictional}} surface {{can result in a}} situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E

25|$|The {{router table}} is usually {{oriented}} so that the router bit is vertical <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> over which the work is passed is horizontal. Variations on this include the horizontal router table, in which the table remains horizontal but the router is mounted vertically above the table, so that the router bit cuts from the side. This is an alternative for edge operations, such as panel raising and slot cutting.|$|E

25|$|Older table-based pinsetters that pick up {{the pins}} between throws could {{malfunction}} if a pin were moved sideways when the ball is thrown, but remained standing. The pin would now be out of alignment with the setter pickup holes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> mechanism would collide with these misplaced pins. Failure of the device to detect pin drift can result in setter mechanism collision damage, pin crush damage, or lane damage from blunt force pressure of the setter pressing down on the misaligned pin.|$|E
25|$|In {{a modern}} table saw, {{the depth of}} the cut is varied by moving the blade up and down: the higher the blade {{protrudes}} above the table, the deeper the cut that is made in the material. In some early table saws, the blade and arbor were fixed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> was moved up and down to expose more or less of the blade. The angle of cut is controlled by adjusting the angle of blade. Some earlier saws angled the table to control the cut angle.|$|E

Seven {{students and a}} faculty member are randomly assigned to each table for a family-style dinner, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> is excused only after everyone has eaten. In the winter, students have dinner with their advisors and advisee groups (a group of 5-6 students are assigned a faculty member to be their advisor), either at the advisors home or at the Upper Dining Hall.

25|$|Starting in 1920, Miró {{developed}} a very precise style, picking out every element in isolation and detail and arranging them in deliberate composition. These works, including House with Palm Tree (1918), Nude with a Mirror (1919), Horse, Pipe and Red Flower (1920), <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Table</b> - Still Life with Rabbit (1920), show the clear influence of Cubism, although in a restrained way, being applied {{to only a}} portion of the subject. For example, The Farmer's Wife (192223), is realistic, but some sections are stylized or deformed, such as the treatment of the woman's feet, which are enlarged and flattened.|$|E
