Food and beverage processing, glassware manufacturing, software and data processing, printing and publishing, insurance underwriting, music and recording, and advanced education activities {{can be found in the}} larger urban areas. The Jamaican construction industry is entirely self-sufficient, with professional technical standards and guidance.|$|E
25|$|The PZL-126 Mrówka (ant) is a Polish {{agricultural}} aircraft first flown in 1990. It is a diminutive low-wing monoplane of conventional if stubby appearance with a T-tail, an enclosed cabin and fixed, tricycle undercarriage. Significant {{parts of the}} design were undertaken by students at the training college attached to the PZL plant at Okęcie {{under the direction of}} Andrzej Słocinski, with the whole project treated initially as a platform for design innovation. Initial design work was completed in 1982 and detail work the following year. Plans to fly a prototype by 1985 were delayed by revisions to the aircraft's equipment, although a mockup was displayed at an <b>agricultural</b> <b>aviation</b> exhibition at Olsztyn that August. Legislation to outlaw certain agricultural chemicals was under consideration in Poland in the late 1980s, spurring interest in biological agents as an alternative and making a tiny aircraft like the Mrówka feasible as a useful piece of agricultural equipment.|$|E

50|$|The sidevalve {{arrangement}} {{was once the}} most common across all motor industries (automotive, <b>agricultural,</b> marine, <b>aviation,</b> and others), but it has since fallen from favor in most multicylinder applications, such as automotive and aviation, having been displaced by overhead valve designs.

25|$|Auditory repellents are {{commonly}} used in both <b>agricultural</b> and <b>aviation</b> contexts. Devices such as propane exploders (cannons), pyrotechnics, and bioacoustics are frequently deployed on airports. Propane exploders are capable of creating noises of approximately 130 decibels (Wildlife Control Supplies). They can be programmed to fire at designated intervals, can be remote controlled, or motion activated. Due to their stationary and often predictable nature, wildlife quickly become habituated to propane cannons. Lethal control {{may be used to}} extend the effectiveness of propane exploders (Washburn et al. 2006).|$|R

50|$|Ghana - United States {{relations}} {{have generally been}} friendly since Ghana's independence, except {{for a period of}} strained relations during the later years of the Nkrumah regime.

The refusal of the United States to join the International Cocoa Agreement, given Ghana's heavy dependence on cocoa exports to earn hard currency, is the most serious bilateral issue between the two countries.|$|R
30|$|In an {{operational}} environment {{such as a}} meteorological office, wind profiler data may both be presented to forecasters and ingested into models. There is also a growing trend for non-meteorologically trained personnel to utilize data from meteorological instruments, {{such as those in}} the mining, <b>agricultural</b> and <b>aviation</b> industries. In all cases, user demands for readily understandable quality-controlled wind data, with excellent spatial and temporal resolution, must be met. Low-level height coverage, that is retrieving good-quality winds from as close to the ground as possible, is of particular importance when larger antenna array sizes and high powers are employed. Addressing these issues for {{an operational}} STP system is the topics for the following discussion.|$|R
