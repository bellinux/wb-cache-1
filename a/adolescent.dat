The migrant <b>adolescents</b> included 55 Chinese migrant <b>adolescents</b> who migrated to Australia (Chinese-Australian) and 111 China-born <b>adolescents</b> who migrated to Hong Kong (Chinese-Hong Kong). The nonmigrant <b>adolescents</b> included 157 Anglo-Australian <b>adolescents</b> residing in Australia and 456 Hong Kong-born Chinese <b>adolescents</b> residing in Hong Kong. There were three research questions in this study. First, would there be any differences in the adaptation of Chinese migrant <b>adolescents</b> in different societies of settlement? Second, would migrant <b>adolescents</b> experience more adaptation problems than nonmigrant <b>adolescents?</b> Third, would there be any differences in the adaptation of <b>adolescents</b> in the two societies, Australia andHong Kong? It was hypothesized that: (1) mainland Chinese migrant <b>adolescents</b> in Hong Kong would experience more adaptation problems than Chinese migrant <b>adolescents</b> in Australia; (2) migrant <b>adolescents</b> would report better adaptation than nonmigrant adolescents; (3) <b>adolescents</b> in Hong Kong would report poorer adaptation than <b>adolescents</b> in Australia. The participants were requested to complete a questionnaire on various adaptation outcome measures including life satisfaction, self-esteem, psychological symptoms, academic satisfaction, and behaviour problems. The results indicated that Chinese-Australian <b>adolescents</b> reported better psychological adaptation but Chinese-Hong Kong <b>adolescents</b> reported better sociocultural adaptation. <b>Adolescents</b> resident in Australia reported higher psychological adaptation but lower sociocultural adaptation than those in Hong Kong.

The results indicate that parents of gifted <b>adolescents</b> tend to be more authoritative and less authoritarian than parents of normal <b>adolescents.</b> The attitudes of the gifted <b>adolescents</b> towards their parents were more positive than those of the normal <b>adolescents.</b> The gifted <b>adolescents</b> displayed a higher self-concept and fewer psychological reactions (depression, anxiety and stress) than the normal <b>adolescents.</b> The authoritative parenting style correlates positively with the psychological adjustment of both gifted and normal <b>adolescents,</b> while the authoritarian parenting style impacts negatively on the psychosocial adjustment of the gifted <b>adolescents</b> but not that of the normal <b>adolescents.</b> The study results indicate that the authoritarian parenting style is a crucial factor that influences the well-being of gifted children and may affect their mental health...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{identify}} {{the magnitude of}} different modes and global frustration, {{to find out the}} effect of domicile on level of frustration of delinquent <b>adolescents</b> and normal <b>adolescents.</b> Study Design: Present one was a comparative study to assess frustration potential of delinquent <b>adolescents</b> and normal <b>adolescents.</b> Place and Duration of Study: Sample: Delinquent <b>adolescents</b> (Observation Homes at Bangalore, Mysore, Shimoga and Dharwad cities of Karnataka State) and normal <b>adolescents</b> (Karnatak Public High School, Karnatak College, K E Board School and Basel Mission High School located in Dharwad City of Karnataka State), between August 2005 and September 2007. Methodology: After choosing the Observation Homes the delinquent subjects, those fall within the age group mentioned below, was selected on random method. Even in selecting the normal <b>adolescents</b> the same procedure was followed. The interview method of data collection was used to get more accurate responses by the subjects. Sample: We included 321 subjects comprising of delinquent <b>adolescents</b> and normal <b>adolescents.</b> Their age ranged between 14 - 18 years. Accordingly the scale suitable for this group was used to assess frustration level. In the delinquent <b>adolescents</b> group the male <b>adolescents</b> who had committed offense and conformed cases of offenses under Indian Penal Code (IPC) were selected. The comparison group of <b>adolescents</b> consisted of normal <b>adolescents</b> without having any delinquent background and studying in 8 th grade to II pre-university course. The selected subjects were administered individually with frustration test. After calculating mean and SD for the groups‘t’ analyses were carried out. Results: Out of 321 <b>adolescents,</b> 150 were delinquent <b>adolescents</b> and 171 were normal <b>adolescents.</b> Significant high mean scores (157. 17 on global frustration, 40. 48 on regression, 39. 99 on fixation, 38. 53 on resignation, 38. 17 on aggression modes of frustration) were found for delinquent <b>adolescents</b> and low mean scores (95. 53 on global frustration, 28. 36 on regression, 22. 89 on fixation, 17. 58 on resignation, 26. 70 on aggression modes of frustration) for the normal <b>adolescents.</b> ‘t’ analysis revealed significant difference between both the groups and {{it was found that the}} delinquent <b>adolescents</b> have high frustration potential. Results related to domicile effect on global frustration revealed that there was no much difference between the rural and the urban delinquent <b>adolescents,</b> the mean scores difference between them were not larger (rural delinquent <b>adolescents</b> 158. 52, and urban delinquent <b>adolescents</b> 156. 92). ‘t’ analysis revealed non-significant difference between the rural and the urban delinquent <b>adolescents.</b> However, mean scores difference between the rural and the urban normal <b>adolescents</b> were found to be larger (rural normal <b>adolescents</b> 99. 26 and urban normal <b>adolescents</b> 91. 48). Further, ‘t’ analysis revealed significant higher frustration potential among the rural normal <b>adolescents</b> than the urban normal <b>adolescents.</b> Conclusion: The frustration potential is higher among the delinquent <b>adolescents</b> on global frustration and on different modes than the normal <b>adolescents.</b> Hence psychological counseling in the rehabilitation process should be essential for these <b>adolescents.</b> Irrespective of the domicile, the delinquent <b>adolescents</b> are prone for higher frustration, but among the normal <b>adolescents</b> only the rural <b>adolescents</b> are found to be prone for higher frustration potential...|$|R
