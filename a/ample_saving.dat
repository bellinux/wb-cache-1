40|$|The {{variation}} {{with energy}} of the total cross section for elastic electron scattering from atoms of several elements is caused primarily by shape resonances corresponding {{to the formation of}} temporary negative ions. It is shown that such cross sections are expressible analytically in terms of a constant background added to a "generalized Fano profile" [Durand Ph, et al (2001) J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 34, 1953, ibid (2002) 35, 469]. In three cases (sodium, magnesium and mercury), a detailed consideration proves that this representation is accurate in a fairly wide energy range. Moreover, the related momentum transfer cross sections are tailor-made for studying "elastic" electron transport in terms of the two-term solution of the Boltzmann equation: Not only are the resulting swarm transport coefficients adjustable to the experimental values, but above all they are calculable very easily because the unnormalized energy distribution is obtainable analytically. The <b>ample</b> <b>saving</b> in computational effort is exploited in order to test the Wannier-Robson "momentum-transfer approximation"; it is found that, in these cases of resonance-dominated cross sections, the latter method can be so accurate that {{it can be used to}} recover the momentum transfer cross section from experimental data algebraically. In the margin, a model profile is presented that gives rise to negative differential conductivity. Comment: 36 pages, 15 figure...|$|E

This surplus explains how even significant government deficit spending would not increase interest rates (because businesses still have access to <b>ample</b> <b>savings</b> if they choose to borrow and invest it, so interest rates are not bid upward) and how Federal Reserve action to increase the money supply does not result in inflation (because the economy is awash with savings with no place to go).|$|R

We introduce SEaMLESS, which transforms a fully-fledged idle VM into a lightweight and resourceless Virtual Network Function (VNF). Idle VMs can then be saved to disk and release their memory. Simultaneously, the VNF provides service availability. Upon user activity, the appropriate VM is restored, without introducing any interruption for service users. Tens of VNFs can be contained within the same memory space required for one single VM, thereby facilitating <b>ample</b> resources <b>savings</b> when scaled up to a data center...|$|R

40|$|One goal {{of human}} {{genetics}} {{is to understand}} the genetic basis of disease, a challenge for diseases of complex inheritance because risk alleles are few relative to the vast set of benign variants. Risk variants are often sought by association studies in which allele frequencies in case subjects are contrasted with those from population-based samples used as control subjects. In an ideal world we would know population-level allele frequencies, releasing researchers to focus on case subjects. We argue this ideal is possible, at least theoretically, and we outline a path to achieving it in reality. If such a resource were to exist, it would yield <b>ample</b> <b>savings</b> and would facilitate the effective use of data repositories by removing administrative and technical barriers. We call this concept the Universal Control Repository Network (UNICORN), a means to perform association analyses without necessitating direct access to individual-level control data. Our approach to UNICORN uses existing genetic resources and various statistical tools to analyze these data, including hierarchical clustering with spectral analysis of ancestry; and empirical Bayesian analysis along with Gaussian spatial processes to estimate ancestry-specific allele frequencies. We demonstrate our approach using {{tens of thousands of}} control subjects from studies of Crohn disease, showing how it controls false positives, provides power similar to that achieved when all control data are directly accessible, and enhances power when control data are limiting or even imperfectly matched ancestrally. These results highlight how UNICORN can enable reliable, powerful, and convenient genetic association analyses without access to the individual-level data. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Compressed air is {{an energy}} {{intensive}} utility that is frequently {{used in the}} deep level mining industry. Most compressed air networks are designed to ensure ample compressed air supply to consumers. This has created the foundation for existing compressed air energy saving projects on deep level mines. Over the past decade, electricity costs in South Africa increased drastically. As a result, the need to further improve and optimise existing Demand Side Management (DSM) projects with modern technology and expertise has become more feasible. This study therefore provides and evaluates a solution to reduce the electricity consumption and operating costs of a compressed air system on a deep level mine. This was achieved by modernising and improving an existing underground compressed air DSM project. It {{was found that the}} improvements realised significant additional electrical energy savings. This resulted in <b>ample</b> cost <b>savings</b> to justify the implementation of the improvements[URL]...|$|R
40|$|There is an appreciable {{amount of}} {{carbonaceous}} sedimentary phosphate deposits {{in the northern}} Africa and the Middle East which are expected to gain importance {{in the near future}} because of the depletion of the deposits in Florida. In many of the regions where phosphate deposits are found {{there is a shortage of}} fresh water, and sea is not very far. The use of sea water instead of fresh water in flotation of carbonaceous phosphate rock is successfully demonstrated. Thus an appreciable reduction in the operating cost and an <b>ample</b> amount of <b>saving</b> in the fresh water resources of the region is expected. Â© 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} data {{in the world is}} {{increasing}} rapidly. One common operation on large datasets is one-to-all comparison, where the goal is to compare one object to all the other objects in the set. This thesis investigates the possibility of approaching the problem using human-computer collaboration. To this end, the human-guided filtering model (HGFM) is proposed. The model provides a general framework for one-to-all comparison, where cluster analysis is used to group similar objects together. Through the help of a human domain expert, the contents of irrelevant clusters can be removed from the process. An implementation of the model is demonstrated, and tested over a series of experiments. During these experiments, it is shown that the model can reduce the size of the dataset with up to 80 % before comparison takes place, creating <b>ample</b> opportunity for <b>saving</b> both time and computational resources. In light of the model's apparent potential, several directions for future research is proposed {{at the end of the}} thesis...|$|R
40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Growing {{demand for}} {{electricity}} forces suppliers {{to expand their}} generation capacity. Financing these expansion programmes results in electricity cost increases above inflation rates. By reducing electricity consumption, additional supply capacity is created at lower costs than the building of conventional power stations. Therefore, there is strong justification to reduce electricity consumption on the supplier and consumer side. The mining and industrial sectors of South Africa consumed approximately 43 % of the total electricity supplied by Eskom during 2012. Approximately 10 % of this electricity was used to produce compressed air. By reducing the electricity consumption of compressed air systems, operating costs are reduced. In turn this reduces the strain on the South African electricity network. Previous energy saving projects on mine compressed air systems realised savings that were not always sustainable. Savings deteriorated due to, amongst others, rapid employee turnover, improper training, lack of maintenance and system changes. There is therefore a need to improve projects {{that have already been}} implemented on mine compressed air systems. The continuous improvement of equipment (such as improved control valves) and the availability of newer technologies can be used to improve existing energy saving strategies. This study provides a solution to reduce the electricity consumption and operating costs of a deep level mine compressed air system. This was achieved by modernising and improving an existing underground compressed air saving strategy. This improvement resulted in a power saving of 1. 15 MW; a saving equivalent to an annual cost saving of R 4. 16 million. It was found that the improved underground compressed air DSM project realised significant additional electrical energy savings. This resulted in <b>ample</b> cost <b>savings</b> to justify the implementation of the project improvements. It is recommended that opportunities to improve existing electrical energy saving projects on surface compressed air systems are investigated. Master...|$|R
40|$|Heat Integration (HI) {{has been}} a {{well-established}} energy conservation strategy in the industry. Total Site Heat Integration (TSHI) has received growing interest {{since its inception in}} the 90 âs due to the <b>ample</b> energy <b>saving</b> potential available from TSHI implementation. This study assesses the TSHI methodology for industrial implementation and extended the TSHI methodology to (a) incorporate pressure drop, (b) maximise energy saving and (c) reduce capital cost of heat transfer area. A detailed assessment of the current TSHI methodology for industrial implementation has identified five key issues influencing the TSHI solution: (1) design, (2) operations, (3) reliability/availability/maintenance (RAM), (4) regulatory/policy and (5) economics. By considering these issues in the early stages, practical TSHI solutions can be obtained. This assessment has provided a direction for future extension of TSHI methodology from the industrial perspective. This work has also extended the TSHI methodology to consider pressure drop, one of the key design issues for Total Site (TS) due to large distances between plants. Pressure drop reduces the amount of steam that can be raised from the Site Source and changes the profile of hot utilities at the various levels. The utility circulation pumps have to be designed for a higher discharge head to overcome the frictional and elevation head loss in the distribution network. Consideration of pressure drop leads to an increase of about 4 % to both the heating and cooling utility requirements and significantly change the hot utilities profile between - 75 % and + 54 %. The improved methodology provides a more realistic basis for the design of central utility systems and the utility circulation pumps. The second and third extended TSHI methodologies complement the individual process analysis by bringing it within the TS context. The second methodology adapts the Plus-Minus Principle and applied it to TS. It identifies the options to maximise energy savings on site using the Total Site Profiles (TSP), the Utility Grand Composite Curve and a new set of heuristics. With the proposed process modifications, a case study performed demonstrated that a potential saving of 9 % in overall heating and 7 % in cooling utilities can be achieved. The third methodology adapts the Keep-Hot-Stream-Hot and Keep-Cold- Stream-Cold Principles to TS. Together with the TSP, the expanded TS Problem- Table-Algorithm and a comprehensive set of heuristics, the TSP is favourably changed to provide a larger temperature driving force to reduce the capital cost of the heat transfer units. The proposed modifications resulted in a modest reduction of heating and cooling utilities of between 1 % and 4 %, respectively and a more noticeable capital cost saving of about 9 %. These two methodologies enable the plant designers/engineers to pinpoint process modification efforts to improve site HI. The proposed changes to the process/streams should be assessed from feasibility, practicality and economic perspective...|$|R
