25|$|The {{remainder}} of Act Two {{is set in}} the Proctor's home. John and Elizabeth are incredulous that nearly forty people have been arrested for witchcraft based on the pronouncements of Abigail and the other girls. John knows their <b>apparent</b> <b>possession</b> and accusations of witchcraft are untrue, as Abigail told him when they were alone together in the first act, but is unsure of how to confess without revealing the affair. Elizabeth is disconcerted to learn her husband was alone with Abigail. She believes John still lusts after Abigail and tells him that as long as he does, he will never redeem himself.|$|E

He claims to have been possessed while committing the crime, but nobody believes him because it {{took place in a}} pharmaceuticals plant.

Saved by an <b>apparent</b> episode of <b>possession</b> of the jury in the trial, he is instead exiled from his community with a letter [...] "H", for [...] "Hoaxer", branded on his forehead.|$|R
50|$|The second {{ground for}} the {{decision}} was that A's failure to give notice had left the beneficiary of the trust in <b>apparent</b> <b>possession</b> of the trust fund, and A could not, therefore, rely on this assignment in a dispute with B. This latter ground has been criticised as {{it appears to be}} based on the concept of reputed ownership in bankruptcy law, which had never previously been employed in determining priority between competing equitable claims. Nevertheless, on the facts of the case most commentators feel that justice was done; A had allowed the beneficiary to commit a fraud on B, and therefore A should rank behind B.|$|E
50|$|Linda Park is a Korean-American {{television}} {{reporter for}} Keystone City and regularly deals with Flash, whom {{she does not}} like. During their initial meeting she constantly hounds Flash about the recent thousands of dollars of property damage caused by his battle with the Porcupine Man. Despite this, Linda and Wally became friends on her first job for Keystone City’s KFMB Channel 4, when they team up to investigate the Celestial Enlightenment Ranch, a spiritual-retreat scam. After Wally helps Linda deal with her <b>apparent</b> <b>possession</b> by the spirit of an 800-year-old Irish bard named Seamus O’Relkig, they become close and soon begin dating. Flash's love for Linda has brought him back many times from the Speed Force. After many obstacles—such as Wally nearly being killed by the Black Flash and Linda being abducted and all memory of her erased by Abra Kadabra (the last requiring the aid of an alternate version of Wally to return home and convince Kadabra to reverse the spell)—they marry.|$|E
40|$|In {{connection}} with experiments on relationships of certain fungi with Type II pneumococci it became important {{to rule out}} the possibility that some of the separate components of the synthetic culture medium might themselves possess serological reactivity. In these control tests it was observed that a clouding of the mixture occurred when a solution of c. p. sucrose was added to Type II antipneumococcus serum; this clouding resembled what one is accustomed to see when a dilute solution of antigen is added to a homologous or a related antiserum. Sucrose from the standpoint of chemical standards can be considered one of the purest of reagents and in fact, the ordinary granulated sugar of commerce is not only perhaps the purest of all common food substances but actually approaches the standards of many chemical reagents. The <b>apparent</b> <b>possession</b> of serological reactivity by a substance of this degree of chemical purity seemed worthy of investigation. In the study that has followed Type II antipneumococcus and other immune serums as well as serums from a large numbe...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{personal property}} rule – {{no one can}} transfer a better title to property than they had – is subject to exceptions in the Sale of Goods legislation, which aim to protect innocent buyers who are deceived by a seller’s <b>apparent</b> physical <b>possession</b> of property. These exceptions cover a limited range of transactions and are restrictive in their operation. Australia now has national legislation - the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth) - which will apply to many transactions {{outside the scope of}} the Sale of Goods Act and which includes rules for sales by non-owners which will provide exceptions to the nemo dat quod non habet rule for many common commercial transactions. This article explores the effect of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth) on the Sale of Goods exceptions, explains that the new provisions are so wide that there is little continuing relevance for the Sale of Goods Act exceptions, and indicates where they may still apply...|$|R
50|$|For example, suppose A steals from B, what B had {{previously}} bought {{in good faith}} from C, which C had earlier stolen from D, which had been an heirloom of D's family for generations, but had originally been stolen centuries earlier (though this fact is now forgotten by all) from E. Here A has the possession, B has an <b>apparent</b> right of <b>possession</b> (as evidenced by the purchase), D has the absolute right of possession (being the best claim that can be proven), and the heirs of E, if they knew it, have the right of property, which they cannot prove. Good title consists in uniting these three (possession, right of possession, and right of property) in the same person(s).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the study}} of Witchcraft in history there has been many {{psychological}} theories that have arisen as to why so many possession cases {{took place during the}} 17th and 18th centuries. One theory is the strict religious atmosphere at the time. It is <b>apparent</b> that most <b>possession</b> cases took place in areas in which religion was the predominant aspect of the society. This could be responsible in the aspect that Knapp felt confined in her community and was frustrated with her situations. She acted out, both mentally and physically, in the only way that she knew, which was through religion. By saying and acting as if she was possessed by the Devil she was [...] against the institution which was restricting her. For example, when Knapp stated that the Devil tried to bribe her on several occasions with fine silks and an ease of labor, her giving in would have been her breaking down her Christian [...]|$|R

Their policing arrangements also differ significantly: how they are organised; how their officers are equipped and trained; what routine operating procedures they employ; whether they are armed; and much else besides.

40|$|Abstract Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) is {{a complex}} neurocutaneous {{disorder}} with an increased susceptibility to develop both benign and malignant tumors but with {{a wide spectrum of}} inter and intrafamilial clinical variability. The establishment of genotype-phenotype associations in NF 1 is potentially useful for targeted therapeutic intervention but has generally been unsuccessful, apart from small subsets of molecularly defined patients. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the clinical phenotype associated with the specific types of NF 1 mutation in a retrospectively recorded clinical dataset comprising 149 NF 1 mutation-known individuals from unrelated families. Each patient was assessed for ten NF 1 -related clinical features, including the number of café-au-lait spots, cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas and the presence/absence of intertriginous skin freckling, Lisch nodules, plexiform and spinal neurofibromas, optic gliomas, other neoplasms (in particular CNS gliomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, phaechromocytoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, juvenile xanthogranuloma, and lipoma) and evidence of learning difficulties. Gender and age at examination were also recorded. Patients were subcategorized according to their associated NF 1 germ line mutations: frame shift deletions (52), splice-site mutations (23), nonsense mutations (36), missense mutations (32) and other types of mutation (6). A significant association was <b>apparent</b> between <b>possession</b> of a splice-site mutation and the presence of brain gliomas and MPNSTs (p [*]=[*] 0. 006). If confirmed, these findings are likely to be clinically important since up to a third of NF 1 patients harbor splice-site mutations. A significant influence of gender was also observed on the number of subcutaneous neurofibromas (females, p [*]=[*] 0. 009) and preschool learning difficulties (females, p [*]=[*] 0. 022). </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{loss of the}} Zanoni in South Australian {{waters in}} 1867 is {{intriguing}} {{for a number of}} reasons. Why did a vessel only sixteen months old capsize in the reasonably sheltered Gulf of St Vincent? With all crew surviving and furnishing the South Australian Government with a good description of its location, why were the Marine Board and other searchers unable to find the wreck? For archaeologists the Zanoni is a rare representative of a 'composite' constructed vessel, and it is currently the only example of this type of nineteenth- century construction to have been found in Australian waters in relatively good condition. From artefacts recovered from the site, it is also <b>apparent</b> that the <b>possessions</b> and equipment of the crew are still on board as they were unable to save anything when the barque capsized and sank during a storm. The material evidence of ships' crews is often difficult to distinguish in the archaeological record, and the Zanoni offers a rare chance to study aspects of shipboard life in detail...|$|R
50|$|Despite {{an early}} chance on goal for Villa, the Saints quickly responded with an {{equalising}} {{goal in the}} 48th minute as Rodriguez headed in Nathaniel Clyne's accurate cross past Brad Guzan in the visitors' goal. After Clyne picked up an injury {{and was replaced by}} José Fonte, Southampton adopted an unorthodox formation with only three defenders, and shortly after the hour mark they went two down through Czech striker Libor Kozák. Once again the Saints responded quickly, with Osvaldo heading in from a Lambert header for his second of the season and the team's second of the match. Aston Villa secured the win ten minutes from time, as Fabian Delph scored with a long-range strike from outside of the penalty area, giving Gazzaniga no chance of preventing the 3-2 scoreline. Despite their <b>apparent</b> domination (78% <b>possession,</b> 21 shots and 9 on target to Villa's 6 and 3), Southampton picked up their first home defeat of the season and their third overall defeat in a row, dropping further to eighth in the table.|$|R
40|$|We {{reconstruct}} a phylogeny of the African and Asian Psittacula parakeets using approximately 800 bp of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence {{to examine}} their evolutionary relationships in reference to their head plumage and major morphological tail innovations. Our phylogeny identifies three groups, whose distinctiveness is also <b>apparent</b> from their <b>possession</b> of three different head plumage characters: a neck ring, a distinctive colouration of the head, and a ‘moustache’-shaped pattern that extends from the chin to the cheek. We examine the extent of sexual dimorphism in tail length across the phylogeny and reveal large differences between closely related forms. We apply a range of published avian cytochrome b substitution rates to our data, {{as an alternative to}} internal calibration of a molecular clock arising from incomplete paleontological information. An ancestral Psittacula form appears to have evolved during the late Miocene-early Pliocene (3. 4 – 9. 7 MYA), a time when regional geological processes on the Asian continent may have promoted subsequent diversity at the species level, and many forms diverged relatively early on in the evolutionary history of Psittacula (between 2. 5 and 7. 7 MYA). However, others, such as the derbyan and moustached parakeets, diverged as recently as 0. 2 MYA. Our phylogeny also suggests that the echo parakeet from Mauritius diverged from the Indian ringneck parakeet as opposed to the African ringneck, and may have done so relatively recently. The molecular results indicate support for a southwards radiation from India across the Indian Ocean to Mauritius, where the arrival-date of the echo parakeet appears consistent with the island’s volcanic formation...|$|R
