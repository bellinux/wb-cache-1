5|$|Florida {{honored the}} American {{alligator}} in 1987, but the Gators have titled the University of Florida's teams since 1911.

5|$|Mulder and Scully rent a {{boat and}} head out onto the lake; their boat is quickly struck by {{something}} and sinks. The two find a large rock to climb up on and talk for a while about Mulder's quest to catch Big Blue, and the book Moby-Dick. When Dr. Farraday walks by the two realize they were close to shore all along. Mulder thinks the drop in the frog supply has caused Big Blue to move closer to shore and seek alternative food sources. Farraday is soon attacked but manages {{to make it out}} alive. Mulder chases the attacker into the woods and fires at it, revealing it to be <b>an</b> <b>alligator.</b> Mulder is disappointed that the killer ended up being <b>an</b> <b>alligator</b> and not Big Blue.

25|$|Most of {{the muscle}} in <b>an</b> <b>alligator's</b> jaw evolved to bite and grip prey. The muscles that close the jaws are {{exceptionally}} powerful, but the muscles for opening their jaws are comparatively weak. As a result, an adult human can hold <b>an</b> <b>alligator's</b> jaws shut bare-handed. It is common today to use several wraps of duct tape to prevent <b>an</b> adult <b>alligator</b> from opening its jaws when being handled or transported.|$|R

5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the lower jaw of <b>an</b> <b>alligator</b> fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. The teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Blackmer and Culp depart {{the next}} morning, their boat is {{attacked}} by <b>an</b> <b>alligator,</b> now enlarged {{because of the}} contamination. Orchard's assistant, Hector McGill, manages to rescue only Blackmer. The house is quickly surrounded by three giant alligators, which throw themselves at the building with Orchard, McGill, Blackmer and Mrs Files trapped inside. On the advice of Mrs Files, McGill contacts International Rescue and John (voiced by Ray Barrett) alerts Tracy Island. Jeff (Peter Dyneley) dispatches Thunderbirds 1 and 2. Arriving at the scene, Scott (Shane Rimmer) briefly dispels the reptiles with his hoverjet cannon and accesses the house through the laboratory window.

5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – <b>an</b> <b>alligator</b> named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives {{on the scene and}} despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their car on the rail for several miles. When the Simpsons get off of the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held by a judge in front of the capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors. It turns out that he was never dead but rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, though they are banned from entering the state of Florida again (and several other states, excluding Arizona and North Dakota).|$|E

25|$|The {{alligators}} {{were the}} central attraction and thrived. At {{one time the}} pond contained {{as many as seven}} of the reptiles.
