5|$|Hurricane Andrew was a Category 5 Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{that struck}} the Bahamas and Florida in mid-August 1992, the most destructive hurricane to ever hit the state. It {{was the strongest}} in decades and the costliest hurricane to make landfall <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> until it was surpassed by Katrina in 2005. Andrew caused major damage in the Bahamas and Louisiana, but the greatest impact was felt in South Florida, with sustained wind speeds as high as 165 mph (270 km/h). Passing directly through the city of Homestead in Dade County (now known as Miami-Dade County), it stripped many homes of all but their concrete foundations. In total, it destroyed more than 63,500 houses, damaged more than 124,000 others, caused $26.5 billion in damage, and left 65 people dead.|$|E

25|$|Nutraceutical Corporation, a {{supplement}} manufacturer based in Park City, Utah, challenged {{the legality of}} the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids as exceeding the authority given the agency by the Dietary Health Supplements and Education Act. Nutraceutical Corporation stated that while they did not intend to restart marketing ephedra, they were concerned about the scope of the FDA's regulatory action. Judge Tena Campbell of the Utah Federal District Court ruled that the FDA had not proven that low doses of ephedra alkaloids were unsafe, although she also noted that studies to address the safety of low-dose ephedra would be unethical. Nevertheless, her ruling overturned the ban on the sale of ephedra alkaloids in the state of Utah, and called into question whether the ban could be enforced <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b>|$|E

500|$|After Hemi, several {{law firms}} warned {{businesses}} that selling {{products on the}} Internet could potentially make them liable for suit <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> For instance, several law firms cautioned clients that, although Hemi [...] "involved a cigarettes retailer, its rationale {{could be applied to}} all Internet retailers." [...] Other commentators observed that the Seventh Circuit's decision in Hemi reflected a [...] "trend away from relying on interactivity of a website as a sole determinant of personal jurisdiction, looking instead toward the more relevant concept of targeting." [...] Moreover, following the Hemi decision, several lawyers began advising clients to include a forum selection clause in their websites' user agreements to at least have the possibility of transferring a lawsuit to their home state.|$|E

500|$|Hazen's regiment, {{which was}} {{significantly}} reduced in size by the retreat from Quebec, was assigned first to Ticonderoga, {{and then to}} Albany, {{in the summer and}} fall of 1776, before being ordered to winter quarters at Fishkill, New York. [...] During this time, Hazen continued recruiting, receiving permission from Congress to recruit <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> [...] In the northern states he ran into difficulties, as those states were having trouble filling their own regimental lines; he was often outbid by other recruiters. [...] Antill, who recruited in the central states (primarily New Jersey, Maryland, and Pennsylvania), had greater success. [...] By June 1777, the regiment reached about 700 members, out of an authorized strength of 1,000. [...] The cultural differences between the original Quebec enlistees and the new recruits from the Thirteen Colonies was a regular source of friction within the regiment, and Hazen consequently kept the French-speakers in companies separated from the English-speakers.|$|E

50|$|Scottish {{banknotes}} are unusual, firstly {{because they}} are issued by retail banks, not central banks, and secondly, as they are technically not legal tender <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom - not even in Scotland.

2500|$|Bilbo was outspoken {{in saying}} that blacks {{should not be allowed}} to vote <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> {{regardless}} of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments to the Constitution. Black World War II veterans complained of longstanding disfranchisement in the South, which Mississippi had achieved in 1890 by changes to its constitution related to electoral and voter registration rules. (Other Southern states followed with similar changes through 1910, which survived most court challenges.) [...] Bilbo's campaign was accused of provoking violence related to voting. Critics accused Bilbo of giving war contracts out to his friends.|$|E
2500|$|Gingrich has {{described}} Sharia (Islamic law) as a [...] "mortal threat" [...] {{and called for}} federal legislation that would ban its use throughout the United States.

In a speech on July 29, 2010, at the American Enterprise Institute, he stated: [...] "The fight against sharia and the maddrassas and mosques which teach hatred and fanaticism {{is the heart of}} the enemy movement from which the terrorists spring forth. ... One of the things I am going to suggest today is a federal law which says no court <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> under any circumstance is allowed to consider Sharia as a replacement for American law."

2500|$|Third, {{many small}} farmers {{with a few}} slaves and yeomen were linked to elite {{planters}} through the market economy. In many areas, small farmers depended on local planter elites for vital goods and services including (but not limited to) access to cotton gins, access to markets, access to feed and livestock, and even for loans (since the banking system was not well developed in the antebellum South). [...] Southern tradesmen often depended on the richest planters for steady work. [...] Such dependency effectively deterred many white non-slaveholders from engaging in any political activity that {{was not in the}} interest of the large slaveholders. [...] Furthermore, whites of varying social class, including poor whites and [...] "plain folk" [...] who worked outside or in the periphery of the market economy (and therefore lacked any real economic interest in the defense of slavery) might nonetheless be linked to elite planters through extensive kinship networks. Since inheritance in the South was often unequitable (and generally favored eldest sons), it was not uncommon for a poor white person to be perhaps the first cousin of the richest plantation owner of his county and to share the same militant support of slavery as his richer relatives. [...] Finally, there was no secret ballot at the time <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> – this innovation did not become widespread in the U.S. until the 1880s.

2500|$|Tupelo has {{an average}} annual {{precipitation}} of over [...] per year – virtually the highest found anywhere in the eastern U.S. outside isolated highland areas and the immediate Gulf Coast (i.e. New Orleans, LA and Pensacola, FL areas), with their heavier summer-season rainfalls. Tupelo’s average annual precipitation cycle demonstrates an unusual pattern for humid-subtropical climates worldwide. Many humid-subtropical areas (like the Shanghai, China area and the U.S. southeast Atlantic coast, i.e. Norfolk, VA; Cape Hatteras, NC; Charleston, SC; Savannah, GA) have highest monthly average precipitation amounts in July or August. In contrast, Tupelo has a prolonged [...] "wetter season" [...] from November to June, and a marked tendency toward drier conditions from late July through October.

Tupelo lies near the heart of Dixie Alley, an area of the U.S. mid-South with a relatively high frequency of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. As elsewhere in Dixie Alley, the primary severe-weather season in Tupelo begins in late February, continuing into May, with a secondary “severe weather” peak in November–December. For example, Tupelo was hit hard by tornadoes in April 1936, and again in April 2014 (see “Severe Weather” section, above).|$|E
