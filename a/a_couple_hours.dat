With Jacob Bannon, Kurt Ballou and Nate Newton all living within {{a half a}} mile {{of each other in}} Boston, and Ben Koller living <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>hours</b> away in Brooklyn, Converge could easily {{practice}} for weeks at a time. Though most songs originated from a guitar or bass riff from Ballou or Newton, all members had equal input on the writing process, with each member proposing different songs. Vocalist Bannon wrote a few songs for Axe to Fall, but were scrapped because they were slower {{than the rest of the}} songs, and did not fit the energy of the album.|$|E
25|$|When Palatine {{police found}} the bodies, {{it was more}} than 5½ hours after the 9 p.m. closing. Michael Castro's parents called the police <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>hours</b> after closing time. Later, Guadalupe Maldonado's wife called police, {{concerned}} that her husband had not returned home from work and that his car was still in the apparently closed Brown's Chicken parking lot. When officers arrived at the building, they spotted the rear employees' door open. Inside, they found the seven bodies, some face-down, some face-up, in a cooler and in a walk-in refrigerator.|$|E

To come out here and spend <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>hours</b> with them and hear their stories is unbelievable. There's nothing better than this." ...|$|E
500|$|Powerful tornadoes {{touched down}} across Tennessee {{as well that}} evening. A violent EF4 struck the {{community}} of New Harmony, Tennessee, where homes were leveled, vehicles were tossed, and four people were killed. Two EF3 tornadoes crossed paths in Greene and Washington counties (coming <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>hours</b> apart), resulting in eight fatalities. The rural communities of Horse Creek and Camp Creek suffered major damage from those tornadoes late that evening. A very large EF4 wedge tornado leveled a mile-wide swath of forest through [...] of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. At Chilhowee Lake, large metal power line truss towers were torn and thrown from their concrete supports that they were anchored to.|$|E

This trail continues on towards Coeur d'Alene for [...] as the North Idaho Centennial Trail and is often used for alternative transportation and recreational use. In the summer, it has long been popular to visit North Idaho's [...] "Lake Country", such as Lake Coeur d'Alene, Lake Pend Oreille, Priest Lake, or one of the other nearby bodies of water and beaches. In the winter, the public has access to five ski resorts within <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>hours</b> of the city. The closest of these is the Mt. Spokane Ski and Snowboard Park, which has trails for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, and dog sledding.|$|E

Wade International Airport reported 10-minute sustained winds of , with gusts to [...] Several stations at higher elevations recorded gusts in excess of , reaching [...] at Commissioner's Point, about [...] above sea level. The most intense winds occurred in a relatively quick burst on the backside of the storm, within a large band of thunderstorms that affected the island <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>hours</b> after the official landfall. Local radar imagery indicated possible tornadic activity coinciding with the period of most damaging winds, though this could also have been an artifact of radar velocity folding. A gauge at St. George's recorded a [...] storm surge, though higher water rises may have affected the southern and western sides of the island. Rainfall unofficially amounted to [...] as reported {{by a member of}} the public, and the airport recorded [...] of rain, though the observing equipment was compromised in both cases.|$|E
500|$|After the April 10, 1967, {{recording}} session, the Experience {{spent the}} next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program Monday Monday and BBC2's Late Night Line-Up. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of Are You Experienced at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of A, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>hours</b> of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to take me away... Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was going to talk my way out of this. At {{the end of the second}} side, he just sat there. Finally, he said, 'This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.'" [...] Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.|$|E

2500|$|Jamie Anne Allman {{spoke about}} the shock of {{learning}} that her character Terry Marek was Rosie Larsen's killer: [...] "Veena Sud had called me <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>hours</b> before I was going in to read for the table read for episode 13, the last episode, that I was the killer. When {{she gave me the}} news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure everybody on the cast was wondering if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved." [...] This scene was in the Ogi Jun episode.|$|E

6000|$|... [November 25-30.][494]--By {{permission}} of the quarantine board we were set at liberty, and lost no time in quitting the dreary fort of Don Manuel, with all its mosquitoes and its thousands of lizards which [stand] shaking their heads at you like their brother in the new Arabian tale of Daft Jock. My son and daughter are already much tired of the imprisonment. I myself cared less about it, but it is unpleasant to be thought so very unclean and capable of poisoning a whole city. We took our guardians' boat and again made a round of the harbour; were met by Mrs. Bathurst's[495] carriage, and carried to my very excellent apartment at Beverley's Hotel. In passing I saw something of the city, and very comical it was; but more of that hereafter. At or about four o'clock we went to our old habitation the Barham, having promised again to dine in the Ward room, where we had a most handsome dinner, and were dismissed at half-past six, after having the pleasure to receive and give <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>hours</b> of satisfaction. I took the boat from the chair, and was a little afraid of the activity of my assistants, but it all went off capitally; went to Beverley's and bed in quiet.|$|E

50|$|Peaking {{power plants}} operate only {{during times of}} peak demand. In {{countries}} with widespread air conditioning, demand peaks around {{the middle of the}} afternoon, so a typical peaking power plant may start up <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of <b>hours</b> before this point and shut down <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of <b>hours</b> after. However, the duration of operation for peaking plants varies from {{a good portion of the}} waking day to only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> dozen <b>hours</b> per year. Peaking power plants include hydroelectric and gas turbine power plants. Many gas turbine power plants can be fuelled with natural gas or diesel. Most plants burn natural gas, but a supply of diesel is sometimes kept on hand in case the gas supply is interrupted. Other gas turbines can only burn either diesel or natural gas.|$|R
