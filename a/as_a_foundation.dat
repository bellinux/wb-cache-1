5|$|The Hippocratic Oath, {{a seminal}} {{document}} on {{the ethics of}} medical practice, was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity although new information shows {{it may have been}} written after his death. This is probably the most famous document of the Hippocratic Corpus. Recently the authenticity of the document's author has come under scrutiny. While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today, it serves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>foundation</b> for other, similar oaths and laws that define good medical practice and morals. Such derivatives are regularly taken today by medical graduates about to enter medical practice.|$|E
5|$|According to Aonuma, the team's {{starting}} point for development was the Wii version of Twilight Princess: feeling they had not fully realized their goal of creating a vast and realistic world with Twilight Princess, they used their previous work <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>foundation</b> for the next title. They also sought to create a memorable experience equivalent to , by that time considered the series' most memorable title. Development lasted around five years, and according to series producer Shigeru Miyamoto, the game's budget was considered quite high for a Nintendo project. The development time was initially estimated at three years, but difficulties {{and changes in the}} game's development extended development time by a further two years: despite this, Miyamoto felt that this was not wasted development time as the first two years went into experimentation. By June 2011, the game was complete aside from fine tuning and balancing its mechanics.|$|E

The main purpose of the acquisition was to use NeXTSTEP <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>foundation</b> to replace the dated classic Mac OS, instead of BeOS or the in-development Copland. The deal was finalized on February 7, 1997, bringing Jobs back to Apple as a consultant, who was later appointed as interim CEO. In 2000 Jobs took the CEO position as a permanent assignment.|$|E

The Ministry of Trade and Industry took {{a renewed interest in}} the satellite station in the early in 1980s and proposed in 1982 that Norway join ESA's European Remote-Sensing Satellite (ERS) program. This started the process of Norway becoming a full member of ESA in 1987. The telemetry station received investments of NOK100 million during the 1980s and was organized <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>foundation</b> in 1984. It took the name Tromsø Satellite Station in 1988. Part of the goal of the project was to create technical spin-offs; the one successful company was Spacetec, which had 45 employees {{at the time it was}} bought by Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace in 1994. By then it had become a global manufacturer of Earth observation ground stations.|$|E
5|$|The Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Trophy is an Australian rules {{football}} award presented {{annually to}} the player(s) adjudged {{the best and}} fairest at the Melbourne Football Club throughout the Victorian Football League/Australian Football League (VFL/AFL) season.

After {{the formation of the}} Victorian Football League in 1896, Melbourne joined the league <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>foundation</b> club the next year and has competed in the league ever since. The inaugural Melbourne best and fairest winner was Allan La Fontaine in 1935, and he retained it the following season. The award was known as the Melbourne best and fairest until it was renamed in 1943 in honour of Keith 'Bluey' Truscott, a former dual premiership player and World War II fighter ace killed in service in 1943.|$|E

It immediately took over Andøya Rocket Range and TSS followed suit in 1990. TSS was upgraded in 1991 to be able to operate with ERS-1. In 1995 NRS established a subsidiary, Norwegian Space Centre Property, to own the facilities in Tromsø and Longyearbyen. The same year, TSS was converted to a limited company, of which half was sold to the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC). The aim was that TSS would operate as a fully commercial enterprise. Its first major contract was with the Canadian Radarsat.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Army {{management}} of Yellowstone {{was so successful}} that by 1891 they were also managing Sequoia, Yosemite and Kings Canyon National Parks in California and Mackinac National Park in Michigan. The National Park Service later followed the precedents established by the army and incorporated them into their own management strategy. During its tenure at Yellowstone, the army developed regulations that put emphasis on protection of park resources, safety of visitors, and positive but effective visitor interaction. Under the watchful eyes of the army, the geothermal features, forests and wildlife of Yellowstone were protected from vandalism, fire and poaching. These practices were adopted by the National Park Service and continue <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>foundation</b> of National Park management policy. Proactive actions by the army in stopping poaching in the park led to {{the passing of the}} Lacey Act of 1894, which established legal protection for the wildlife and remedies for dealing with violators.|$|E
5|$|With this {{contribution}} of von Neumann, the axiomatic {{system of the}} theory of sets avoided the contradictions of earlier systems, and became usable <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>foundation</b> for mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. The next question was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be posed in it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms {{that could be used to}} prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of Königsberg, in which Kurt Gödel announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. Moreover, every consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain incomplete.|$|E
