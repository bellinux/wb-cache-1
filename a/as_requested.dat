5|$|<b>As</b> <b>requested</b> by Walpole, George {{revived the}} Order of the Bath in 1725, which enabled Walpole to reward or gain {{political}} supporters by offering them the honour. Walpole became extremely powerful and was largely able to appoint ministers {{of his own}} choosing. Unlike his predecessor, Queen Anne, George rarely attended meetings of the cabinet; most of his communications were in private, and he only exercised substantial influence with respect to British foreign policy. With the aid of Lord Townshend, he arranged for the ratification by Great Britain, France and Prussia of the Treaty of Hanover, {{which was designed to}} counterbalance the Austro-Spanish Treaty of Vienna and protect British trade.|$|E

5|$|Dead Island, {{originally}} {{announced in}} 2007 by Techland, is an action role-playing survival horror video game. Set in a zombie-infested tropical island called Banoi, the game focuses heavily on melee combat. According to Techland, {{it was a}} game about killing zombies, not a game focused on delivering an emotional experience. Until 2011, Techland declined to give new information regarding the game <b>as</b> <b>requested</b> by the game's publisher, Deep Silver. With the lack of new information surrounding the game, many critics believed that the game had been quietly cancelled. The game was released on February 16, 2011, approximately four years after the game's initial announcement.|$|E
5|$|Initially Bueno's mother {{claimed to}} be the {{absolute}} owner of his recorded material as well as profits.

Pacheco claimed that Ramiro Pacheco was the legitimate son of Bueno and requested a DNA test to verify it. The lawyers sent legal notices to Olave, her lawyer Miguel Angel Pierri and Gozalo stating that none of the assets of Bueno's estate could be used or spent until it was decided which one of the parties would inherit them.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of new deputies increased disputes within the Junta. He opposed both Saavedra and Funes, albeit {{in a more}} moderate manner than Moreno. Those fights affected his health, {{and he had a}} mild heart attack on 28 January 1811. Fearing for his life, he wrote his will and received the Anointing of the Sick. Three days later he had another strong disagreement with Funes, and had another heart attack when he was returning to his house. He was buried in the cemetery of San Nicolás de Bari, <b>as</b> <b>requested</b> in his will. The death certificate states that he hadn't been given last rites because his unanticipated death did not allow for time. Alberti was the first member of the Primera Junta to die.|$|E

5|$|Rodríguez Saá {{prepared}} a budget bill for 2002, which {{was sent to}} the Congress. It included an important decrease in the deficits, <b>as</b> <b>requested</b> by Anne Krueger from the International Monetary Fund. Krueger also requested a new coparticipation law, to determine the way the nation and the provinces manage tax revenues. Rodríguez Saá called for a meeting with governors in Chapadmalal, but only six governors out of twenty-three attended: Carlos Ruckauf, Juan Carlos Romero, Gildo Insfrán, Ángel Mazza, Carlos Rovira and Alicia Lemme. José Manuel de la Sota, governor of Córdoba, withdrew his support, suspecting that Rodríguez Saá had plans to cancel the elections and stay as president up to 2003. On December 30, he returned to San Luis with Daniel Scioli and resigned, alleging lack of support {{from the rest of the}} Justicialist Party. Insfrán, Maza and minister Rodolfo Gabrielli tried to convince him to stay as president; his brother Alberto Rodríguez Saá supported his decision. In announcing his resignation in a Cadena nacional, he recounted the achievements of his one-week administration and accused Justicialist governors and legislators of meanness and shortsightedness. He dispatched his resignation from San Luis to Buenos Aires, and the Congress accepted it on January 1, 2002. The Senate chairman Ramón Puerta would have been the interim president, but resigned as well, so Eduardo Camaño, president of the Chamber of Deputies, was appointed interim president instead. After new deliberations, they elected Eduardo Duhalde as president, this time with a mandate that would fill the remaining time of delaRúa's mandate.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to present {{realistic}} behaviour of Slotted Aloha (S-ALOHA), used <b>as</b> <b>Request</b> Access Channel (RACH), with good performance regarding stability, efficiency, delay and capacity of traffic control. We present modelling and simulation of those parameters, which most influence the performance in terms of stability, and efficiency of the MAC technique based on S-Aloha. Considering particularly those aspects that degrade in greater scale {{the response of the}} system, such as: retransmission algorithm, capture effect and radio channel effects, we show that throughput can be improved in 70 % and can be stabilised. Therefore, if we use S-Aloha <b>as</b> <b>Request</b> Access Channel (RACH), it could be a good alternative for third-generation systems...|$|R
