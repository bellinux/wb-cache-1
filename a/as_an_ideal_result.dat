40|$|The {{expansion}} of broadband networks, new radio technologies and ever more powerful end devices are the innovation drivers behind new digital applications. A further development {{is taking place}} in the building sector which will convert the building development process into a comprehensive, seamless digital and collaborative workflow. BIM describes this method, creating a digital prototype of a building - a twin - <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>result.</b> This digital twin incorporates all the different technical disciplines in a digital planning result, forming a visual basis for ongoing decision and assessment processes. However, the digital building model does not only play a major role during the construction process. Particularly in the subsequent usage phase, it serves as a basis for operator processes concerning planning, execution and continuous improvement. Several examples, from both the construction and usage phase, illustrate current developments and applications. The building of tomorrow will respond to changing usage requirements, as well as to digitisation possibilities, and adapt accordingly. Four general theorie as well as examples of pilot projects and an outlook, underline and demonstrate this development roadmap...|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamentally}} different mechanism for memristive behavior {{has been proposed}} by Pershin and Di Ventra. The authors show that certain types of semiconductor spintronic structures belong to a broad class of memristive systems as defined by Chua and Kang. The mechanism of memristive behavior in such structures is based entirely on the electron spin degree of freedom which allows for a more convenient control than the ionic transport in nanostructures. When an external control parameter (such as voltage) is changed, the adjustment of electron spin polarization is delayed because of the diffusion and relaxation processes causing hysteresis. This result was anticipated {{in the study of}} spin extraction at semiconductor/ferromagnet interfaces, but was not described in terms of memristive behavior. On a short time scale, these structures behave almost <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> memristor. This <b>result</b> broadens the possible range of applications of semiconductor spintronics and makes a step forward in future practical applications.|$|R
40|$|In today's {{competitive}} environment and globalized economy, customers are demanding more varieties and better quality products with faster and reliable deliveries. New manufacturing technologies are developing rapidly, resulting in new products, innovations {{and improvements in}} the manufacturing process, thus, requiring a proactive approach by organizations. To be proactive, organizations require innovative methods of performance measurement, to assess their progress towards achieving organizational mission, vision and strategic objectives. The recent performance measurement literature has put forward a number of suggestions, recommendations and performance measurement frameworks for manufacturing companies. The purpose of this thesis is to assess {{the extent to which}} manufacturing companies are following these prescriptions. This research adopts an exploratory case study approach with a qualitative research method for collecting and analyzing the data. The case chosen in this study is Alfa Laval Lund AB. In this research, the main methods used for data collection are interview, questionnaire and electronic database. The empirical findings were analyzed through identifying themes from the data, by relying on theoretical propositions derived from the literature. In evaluating the organisation’s performance measurement system, Kaplan and Norton’s balanced scorecard was used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> model. The <b>results</b> show that Alfa Laval Lund AB follows the prescriptions of the recent performance measurement literature, thus, increasing its level of performance measurement competence. The concept of performance measurement competence suggests that organizations use measures that fit with their strategy, their organizational structure and the environmental uncertainty that they face. The type of strategy employed by a firm should influence the design of its performance measurement system. Godwill Tapisi Mukonje tapisi@yahoo. co...|$|R

40|$|Literature {{is always}} {{interesting}} {{to be discussed}} because it is related to real life. The main function of literature is to satisfy the readers or audience and bring them into their thought through literary works. Literary works {{could be in the}} form of poem, novel, drama, or film. This study analyzed a film because film can be enjoyed audio visually. Â“Front of the ClassÂ” film is chosen to be analyzed because it is based on life which is showed by the main character Bradley Cohen. In order to analyze Â“Front of the ClassÂ” film, there are some purposes of this study. The purposes of this study were explaining what made Bradley Cohen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> teacher, identifying the problems faced by Bradley Cohen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> teacher, and describing the ways Bradley Cohen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> teacher to cope the problems in film Â“front of the ClassÂ”. This analysis was focused on Bradley Cohen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> teacher on Peter WernerÂ’s film Â“front of the ClassÂ”. The research applied descriptive qualitative design by collecting the data and reviewing literature which are relevant to the topic to prove research data. The technique of this research was library research; meanwhile, the data were taken from the film itself. The approach used in this research was objective approach which focused on analyzing the main character <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> teacher in film. The finding of this analysis was shown by Bradley Cohen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> teacher. Bradley Cohen had five factors <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> teacher: engaging the students in the beginning of teaching, guiding the student to the right behavior, motivating student, having good characteristics, and getting reward as the best teacher. There are three problems faced by Bradley Cohen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> teacher: having Tourette syndrome, facing naughty student, and being underestimated by studentÂ’s parents. Then, it is followed by the ways Bradley Cohen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ideal</b> teacher to cope the problems: keeping calm down in coping with his Tourette syndrome, giving punishment and motivating student, and keeping being friendly in coping with his studentÂ’s parents...|$|R
