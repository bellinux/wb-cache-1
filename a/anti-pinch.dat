40|$|Abstract. This paper puts {{forward a}} control {{scheme based on}} LIN bus for {{automotive}} <b>anti-pinch</b> power window. The article first gives {{an overview of the}} structure and function of the system, and then describes the design of the hardware and software in detail. We choose a 16 -bit Freescale chip MC 9 S 12 VR 64 which has a mixed signal processing performance as the microcontroller. The <b>anti-pinch</b> algorithm is mainly based on the Hall signal, and the network communications use LIN bus.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{neutrino}} events from the supernova (SN) 1987 A detected by the Kamiokande II (KII) and Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven (IMB) experiments. For the time-integrated flux we assume a quasi-thermal {{spectrum of the}} form (E/E_ 0) ^α e^-(α+ 1) E/E_ 0 where α {{plays the role of}} a spectral index. This simple representation not only allows one to fit the total energy E_ tot emitted in ν̅_e and the average energy, but also accommodates a wide range of shapes, notably <b>anti-pinched</b> spectra that are broader than a thermal distribution. We find that the pile-up of low-energy events near threshold in KII forces the best-fit value for α to the lowest value of any assumed prior range. This applies to the KII events alone as well as to a common analysis of the two data sets. The preference of the data for an "unphysical" spectral shape implies that one can extract meaningful values for and E_ tot only if one fixes a prior value for α. The tension between the KII and IMB data sets and theoretical expectations for is not resolved by an <b>anti-pinched</b> spectrum. Comment: to appear in PRD (6 pages, 6 eps figures...|$|R
40|$|At the {{interaction}} {{point of the}} International Linear Collider, beam-beam effects due to the strong electromagnetic fields that the bunches experience during collisions cause a mutual focusing called pinch effect, which enhances the luminosity {{in the case of}} $e^+e^-$ collisions. The opposite is true for $e^+e^-$ collisions. In this case the luminosity is reduced by mutual defocusing, or <b>anti-pinching.</b> The resulting beamstrahlung energy loss and beam-beam deflection angles as function of the vertical transverse offset are also different for both modes of operation. The dependence of these quantities with transverse beam sizes are presented for the case of $e^+e^-$ collisions...|$|R
40|$|The e − e − {{running mode}} {{is one of}} the {{interesting}} physics options at the International Linear Collider (ILC). The luminosity for e − e − collisions is reduced by the beam-beam effects. The resulting beamstrahlung energy loss and beambeam deflection angles as function of the vertical transverse offset are different compared to the e + e − collisions. In this paper, the dependence of these observables with the offset for different beam sizes has been analyzed to optimize performances for the e − e − mode, taking into account the requirements of the beam-beam deflection based intra-train feedback system. A first study of the implications for the final focus and extraction line optics is also presented for the cases of the 20 mrad and 2 mrad ILC base line crossing angle geometries. BEAM-BEAM EFFECTS At the Interaction Point (IP) of the ILC, beam-beam effects due to the strong electromagnetic fields that the bunches experience during collisions cause a mutual focusing, called pinch effect, which enhances the luminosity in the case of e + e − collisions. The opposite is true for e − e − collisions. In this case the luminosity is reduced by mutual defocusing, or <b>anti-pinching</b> and is only about 20 % of the e + e − one (see Fig. 1). Moreover this repulsion between the bunches causes the luminosity to drop with a vertical offset at the IP much more rapidly for the e − e − case than for e + e −. Another effect of this strong repulsive electromagnetic field is the much steeper beam-beam deflection ∗ Work supported in part by FP 5 (PROBE FOR NEW PHYSICS) contract RTN 2 - 2001 - 00450, FP 6 (CARE) contract RII 3 -CT- 2003 - 50639...|$|R
40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the design of}} Electronic Control Units (ECUs) for the Body Control System (BCS) of Pure Electric Vehicle (PEV). The main research contents are divided into two parts: its CANopen application layer protocol and the model based design of fault detection for <b>anti-pinch</b> window. Firstly, {{the structure of the}} BCS and the function of each ECU were analyzed. Then according to the communication needs among the ECUs, the CANopen protocol for each ECU was designed. It contained the design of Network Management, Process Data Objects and Service Data Objects. A CANopen network simulation platform was designed by CANoe software and its components CANoe. CANopen. According to the analysis of <b>anti-pinch</b> window model system, the algorithm based on H-/H∞ fault detection observer estimation is proposed. Apart from the previous methods, the pinch torque rate is considered as a fault under the pinched condition to generate a residual. A residual is zero in normal, but it will deviate from the constant when sensing the pinched condition. Co-simulation model of CANopen protocol and the <b>anti-pinch</b> model based on CANoe-MATLAB and the bench test are design to verify the designed ECUs. The test results show that the bus load rate is 3. 49 % and the results of detection time are respectively 0. 18 and 0. 185 s, which show the CANopen protocol and the <b>anti-pinch</b> algorithm are proper to the BCS of PEV...|$|E
40|$|A {{practical}} pinch torque estimator {{based on}} the H∞ filter is proposed for low-cost <b>anti-pinch</b> window control systems. To obtain the acceptable angular velocity measurements, the angular velocity calculation algorithm was proposed with the measurement noise reduction logics in previous method. Apart from the previous works {{based on the}} angular velocity or torque estimates for detecting the pinched condition, the proposed pinch detection algorithm makes use of the torque rate information integrated with state flow chart. To do this, the torque rate is augmented to the system model and the torque rate estimator is derived by applying the steady-state H∞ filter recursion to the model. The motivation of this approach comes from {{the idea that the}} torque rate is less sensitive to the motor parameter uncertainties. Moreover, the statistics of modeling errors and angular velocity measurement noises are actually unknown. Hence, the proposed scheme minimizes the <b>anti-pinch</b> window control system's exposure to the false alarm. To detect the pinched condition, a systematic way to determine the threshold level of the torque rate estimates is also suggested via the deterministic estimation error analysis. Experimental results certify the pinch detection performance of the proposed algorithm and its robustness against the motor parameter uncertainties...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} solve {{the risk of}} safety on power window, an improved pinch detection algorithm based on the fault detection observer estimation is proposed for an <b>anti-pinch</b> window control system. In designing a residual generator, the proposed fault detection algorithm makes use of the pinch torque rate information by establishing the mathematical model of DC, considered as a fault under the pinched condition. By comparing the residual signal with the pre-designed threshold, the occurrence of pinch is detected. The fault detection observer takes into account robustness against disturbances and sensitivity to faults, simultaneously, {{both of which are}} regarded as optimization problems. In this study, the mixed H-/H∞ performance index and reference model fault detection method are advanced to solve the optimization problem in the Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) which transforms a mathematical problem. The simulation results of the detection time obtained from the two methods are 0. 15 and 0. 07 s, respectively, proving that the use of the fault detection algorithm is effective for an <b>anti-pinch</b> window. The co-simulation based on CANoe-MATLAB is proposed to verify the algorithm again. Moreover, under the premise of strong robustness, the reference model method is superior to the mixed H-/H∞ performance...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} solve {{the risk of}} safety on power window, this study introduces the LMI-based method of designing robust fault detection H∞ filter for <b>anti-pinch</b> window control system. For detecting the pinched condition, the pinch torque is considered as a fault to design a residual generator. By comparing the residual signal with the pre-designed threshold, the occurrence of pinch can be detected. The main contribution consisted of the formulation of the multi-objective optimization H∞ and H- problem as H∞ optimization problem by using the residual error instead of residual. The solution of the optimization problem is solved via LMI technique. Based on MATLAB, {{the results show that}} the algorithm can detect the fault after it occurs 70 ms. In addition, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has high sensitivity to fault and strong robustness to uncertainties...|$|E
40|$|Window {{regulator}} {{system is}} becoming a complicated mechatronic system. To obtain and improve understandings of system behaviors, this work developed models and simulations. To realize the target, system simulation with uniformed modeling language, VHDL-AMS, is chosen as tool. At first, dynamic behavior of window regulator system is studied with method of averaging by a highly abstracted model. As next, main components, e. g. electrical drive, lifting mechanism, door frame and electronic system, are studied and modelled. Parametrization achieves with information from suppliers, existing data bank and measurements. Component models are verified and validated against their measurements. Afterwards, system simulation is built up by assembling component models. As verification and validation, system simulations are compared to measurements. As applications, simulations are used to investigate <b>anti-pinch</b> processes, influence of drum diameter and so on. Depending on the purpose of usage, they can be further improved. As summary, simulation provides support in development of window regulator systems.
