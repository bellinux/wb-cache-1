5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of JC Denton, a nanotech-augmented {{operative}} of the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO). This nanotechnology is a central gameplay mechanism <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> players to perform superhuman feats.|$|E
5|$|Women's role in {{ministry}}: The AG {{affirms the}} ministry {{of women in the}} church <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> them to be ordained and serve in pastoral roles (see Ordination of women).|$|E
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. The crew would normally start decompression {{as soon as possible}} after launching.|$|E
5|$|Coursed mud {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> to dry. More mud is added <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form is filled with wetter mud <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> to dry.|$|R
40|$|According to the Doctrine of Doing <b>and</b> <b>Allowing,</b> the {{distinction}} between doing <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> harm is morally significant. Doing harm is harder to justify than merely allowing harm. This paper is the second of a two paper critical overview {{of the literature on}} the Doctrine of Doing <b>and</b> <b>Allowing.</b> In this paper, I consider the moral status of {{the distinction}} between doing <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> harm. I look at objections to the doctrine such as James’ Rachels’ Wicked Uncle Case and Jonathan Bennett’s argument that any acceptable analysis of the distinction leaves it implausible that the distinction is morally relevant. I consider putative defences of the Doctrine from Philippa Foot and Warren Quinn. I argue that neither Foot not Quinn provides a satisfactory justification of the Doctrine of Doing <b>and</b> <b>Allowing,</b> but that the idea of self-ownership discussed by Quinn can be developed to provide a justification of the doctrine...|$|R
50|$|The New York Rangers {{lost five}} of their six {{pre-season}} games, {{during which they}} scored nine goals <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> 22 goals against. They went 2-for-22 on the power play <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> five power play goals against {{in the last three}} games.|$|R
5|$|A wet bell, or open bell, {{is similar}} to a diving stage in concept, but has an air space, open to the water at the bottom in which the divers, or at least their heads, can shelter during ascent and descent. A wet bell {{provides}} more comfort and control than a stage <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> for longer time in the water. Wet bells are used for air and mixed gas, and divers can decompress using oxygen from a mask at 12m.|$|E
5|$|After Raju and {{his team}} {{retrieve}} the gold, they are detained by local police. Raju identifies himself as a RAW agent {{and his team}} as intelligence officers from various agencies of India. He discloses his real name as Rajeev Sathyamoorthy. The police release them so they can complete their investigation <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> them {{to go back to}} Mumbai. Near the end of the film, it is revealed that Raju and his team are the actual smugglers.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with items}} and money earned from battles, winning battles earns {{experience}} points which increases each party member's level <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> {{them to learn}} skills from their weapons. Performing well in battles, such as achieving quick victories or successful Session Attacks, increases party members' Stage Level, which unlock Performa for Radiant Skills and opens up new side stories. The game ends, sending the player back to the title screen, if all party members are knocked unconscious by running out of HP.|$|E

50|$|A {{hardening}} fluid of {{one part}} potassium silicate to two parts water is then brushed on <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> to dry for 24 hours, before a second layer is applied <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> to dry again. This surface may be painted immediately, or may sit unpainted for several years.|$|R
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the fourth series, Nikita is shown without a mate after the death of Hannibal. Nikita is {{impregnated}} by Seacrest, a Whiskers roving male, in the third episode of the fourth series. In the fourth, she accepts Whiskers rover Zorro as the groups dominant male, <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> his four brothers to join the group.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars undergo ecdysis {{and have}} a number of larval instars, usually five but varying between species. The new cuticle is soft <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> the {{increase}} in size and development of the caterpillar before becoming hard and inelastic. In the last ecdysis, the old cuticle splits and curls up into a small ball at the posterior end of the pupa and is known as the larval exuvia.|$|E
30|$|Eggs were {{synchronized}} <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> {{to develop}} at 20 °C until day two of adulthood. Ten synchronized hermaphrodites {{were transferred to}} a new plate <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> to lay eggs for 6 h, then eggs and young adult progeny were counted. All experiments were performed in three independent replicates.|$|R

5|$|Christian metal {{groups such}} as Barnabas and Extol have criticized bands within the {{industry}} {{for a lack of}} innovation and for isolating bands within the industry. Pastor Bob Beeman of Sanctuary International stated that this is a compliment to secular music, as it lets people to listen to the music they enjoyed without feeling like they are giving up on the style they love <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> bands to crossover into mainstream success.|$|E
5|$|Compressor diving is a {{rudimentary}} method of surface-supplied diving {{used in some}} tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> excess air to spill out between the lips.|$|E
5|$|Copper is used {{to create}} stills for distilling spirits, for example to make whisky. It's {{malleability}} {{makes it easy to}} bend into the various shapes required <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> considerable flexibility in the shaping of the still and associated pipework; the metal also reacts with undesirable sulfur-containing components in the vapor and distillate making for a cleaner product.|$|E
50|$|A few {{different}} types of traps include thermostatic, mechanical. Traps are designed to capture a desired substance <b>and</b> <b>allow</b> another substance to transfer into its desired location. During operation of a boiler, a trap {{would be used to}} capture condensate <b>and</b> <b>allow</b> steam to flow free of any unwanted condensate.|$|R

5|$|Crossbreeding {{increases}} {{production efficiency}} because of hybrid vigour, <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> complementary traits of {{parents to be}} combined to produce progeny better suited to different environments or markets. Crossbreeding {{through the use of}} Limousin terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds allows the complementary traits of higher marbling and fat cover provided by the British breed cows, and required or preferred by some markets, to be combined with the higher yield and feed conversion efficiency of Limousin sires.|$|E
5|$|EMA {{is used in}} {{linguistics}} and speech pathology to study articulation and in medicine to study oropharyngeal dysphagia. Unlike other methods of data collection, EMA does not expose subjects to ionizing radiation <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> for large amounts of data to be collected easily.|$|E

He created YMAX Communications Corporation in April 2006 as a communications and equipment service. YMAX's profits come from the production of the magicJack, a small device which can be plugged into a computer's USB port <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> for unlimited calling from regular telephones.|$|E
5|$|Lady Denman Drive, a roadway {{atop the}} dam wall, {{provides}} a third road crossing for the lake. It {{consists of a}} roadway and a bicycle path, <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> residents in western Canberra to cross the lake. This was possible because the dam gates are closed by pushing up from below, unlike most previous designs that wherein the gates were lifted from above.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} members of its genus, the red-throated loon is well adapted to its aquatic environment: its dense bones help it to submerge, its legs—in their {{set-back}} position—provide excellent propulsion, and its body is long and streamlined. Even its sharply pointed bill may help its underwater streamlining. Its feet are large, its front three toes are fully webbed, and its tarsus is flattened, which reduces drag <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> the leg to move easily through the water.|$|E
