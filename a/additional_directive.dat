50|$|The French Foreign Legion {{was created}} by a royal {{ordinance}} issued by King Louis Philippe, {{at the suggestion of}} Minister of War Nicolas Jean-de-Dieu Soult, on March 9, 1831. Nine days later on March 18, 1831, an <b>additional</b> <b>directive</b> was issued restricting membership in the newly formed Legion to foreigners. The latter directive reflected the initial purpose of the Foreign Legion as a mechanism to lessen the potential disruption to the provisional French government and the newly enthroned House of Orléans posed by the large influx of foreigners following the collapse of the Bourbon Restoration in the previous year's July Revolution. Some of these foreigners in France were the remnants of regiments formed during the campaigns of Napoleon of Germans, Swedes, Poles, Hungarians, and others. These foreign veterans had been left with little means and professional military training which proved to be of concern the French government. Many had flocked to France following the July Revolution or came to France following failures of the revolutionary or independence movements throughout Europe; in addition to an influx of idealistic revolutionaries and nationalist, France also became home to large numbers of immigrants who had removed from their countries of origin for economic or personal reasons. This influx of foreigners had become a significant burden for the newly established French government's administrative capabilities; for example during March 1831 a depot established in Langres, France to accommodate these recent immigrants had been inundated to point of overstretch. Furthermore, French military operations in Algeria, which had commenced under Charles X, had proven unpopular with portions of the French populace as the campaign, despite its initial success, had become bogged down in the occupation of that country. The formation of the Foreign Legion would help address the domestic threat of dissidents fomenting political instability while contributing to government's colonial endeavors in Algeria.|$|E

User programs are compiled, with a set of transformations including rewriting and stratification, and then translated into LOA programs, i. e. sequences of fixpoint systems of algebraic equations. The object oriented schema is mapped into a relational schema, and the database is actually managed by a relational DBMS, that provides the basic support for the permanent storage of data as well as for concurrency control and recovery. The object algebra expressions can then be mapped into relational algebra expressions, thus relying on the efficiency of the RDBMS for the access to mass storage structures and the efficient execution of set-oriented operations.

Two important properties of gravity waves which are difficult if not impossible to determine by the monostatic method are discussed. The first of these is the polarization of the gravity waves; that is, the complex ratio of the wave functions of vertical and horizontal motion. A second quantity of importance is the horizontal wavelength of gravity waves. Both of these problems could be overcome by use of a bistatic system.

40|$|Background. The goal {{of advance}} {{directives}} {{is to help}} patients retain their dignity and autonomy by making their own decisions regarding end-stage medical treatment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine preferences of advance directives among general population in Korea. Method. A descriptive cross-sectional survey was performed from October 2007 to June 2008 in Seoul, Korea. A total of 336 city-dwelling adults self-administered the questionnaire and returned it via mail. Data analyses were conducted using SPSS 17. 0. Results. Subjects reported the need for healthcare providers' detailed explanations and recommendations regarding end-of-life care. When there is no hope of recovery and death is imminent, most subjects did not want to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation nor an IV or tube feeding. However, most of the subjects wanted pain management care. Conclusions. The present study showed that many Korean people have an interest in advance directives.

To analyse and assess the impact of the Oder river basin on coastal water quality during the last 40 years, we apply a spatially integrated, large-scale model approach covering the entire river basin – river – coastal water – sea system. For this purpose the river basin model MONERIS is linked to the three-dimensional ecosystem model of the Baltic Sea (ERGOM).

Methods. By using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Nursing Home Component matched with county-level measures from the Area Resource File, we modeled the probability of having an advance directive as a function of nursing home resident, facility, and county characteristics for African American and White residents. Results. The probability of having an advance directive was 27. 0 % for African American residents and 63. 6 % for White residents.

40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{losses from}} {{agricultural}} soils have caused surface water quality impairment {{in many regions}} of the world, including The Netherlands. Due to the large amounts of P accumulated in Dutch soils, the generic fertilizer and manure policy will {{not be sufficient to}} reach in time the surface water quality standards of the European Water Framework <b>Directive.</b> <b>Additional</b> measures must be considered to further reduce P enrichment of surface waters. One option is to immobilize P in soils or manure or to trap P when it moves through the landscape by using reactive materials with a large capacity to retain P. We characterized and tested two byproducts of the process of purification of deep groundwater for drinking water that could be used as reactive materials: iron sludge and iron-coated sand. Both materials contain low amounts of inorganic contaminants, which also have a low (bio) availability, and bound a large amount of P. We could describe sorption of P to the iron sludge in batch experiments well with the kinetic Freundlich equation (Q = a × tm × Cn). Kinetics had a large influence on P sorption in batch and column experiments and should be taken into account when iron-containing materials are tested for their capability to immobilize or trap P. A negative aspect of the iron sludge is its low hydraulic conductivity; even when mixed with pure sand to a mixture containing 20 % sludge, the conductivity was very low, and only 10 % sludge may be needed before application is possible in filters or barriers for removing P from groundwater. Due to its much higher hydraulic conductivity, iron-coated sand has greater potential for use under field conditions.

40|$|Abstract Before any {{medicinal}} product is authorised {{for use in}} adults, it must undergo extensive pharmaceutical consistency and stability tests, toxicological tests and clinical trials {{to ensure that it}} is of high quality, safe and effective. The same approach may not always be applied to {{medicinal product}}s used to treat children. Studies showed that over 50 % of the medicinal products used in children may not have been tested for use in this age group. The absence of suitable authorised medicinal products to treat conditions in children results from the fact that pharmaceutical companies do not adapt medicinal products {{to the needs of the}} paediatric population. This leaves health care professionals with no alternative other than to use medicinal products "off-label" and to use unauthorised products with the associated risks of inefficacy and/or adverse reactions. The Regulation (EC) No 1901 / 2006 sets up a system of requirements, rewards and incentives, together with horizontal measures, to ensure that medicinal products are researched, developed and authorised to meet the therapeutic needs of children. The Regulation is addressed to: 1. The pharmaceutical industry by setting out the legal framework for receiving rewards and incentives by conducting clinical trials in the paediatric population. 2. The Member States to set out to support research into, and the development and availability of, medicinal products for paediatric use. 3. The Community as funds for research into medicinal products for the paediatric population shall be provided for in the Community budget in order to support studies relating to medicinal products or active substances not covered by a patent or a supplementary protection certificate. The legal framework for conducting clinical trials, including children/minors, is set up in Directive 2001 / 20 /EC, the Clinical Trials Directive (CTD), for the European Union (EU). The CTD establishes specific provisions regarding conduct of clinical trials, including multi-centre trials, on human subjects involving medicinal products and in particular relating to the implementation of good clinical practice. Compliance with this good practice provides assurance that the rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects are protected, and that the results of the clinical trials are credible. The CTD is addressed to all investigators conducting clinical trials including clinical trials in the paediatric population and had to be applied accordingly. In the framework of the authorisation of medicinal products regulated by the Regulation (EC) No 726 / 2004 and Directive 2001 / 83 /EC as amended and the CTD, and <b>additional</b> implementing <b>Directives</b> and guidelines, the new Regulation (EC) No 1901 / 2006 is an important new piece of legislation focusing on the requirements to improve the situation for the paediatric population.

40|$|In each country, {{the concept}} of housing exists in {{relationship}} between the ways people live, the local climate, {{the social and political}} factors that affect the evolution of architecture and the actual structure of the house. The economic developments of the countries and the political situations and regulations have all affected the rise of the residential market. In Greece, where the majority of the residential buildings were constructed between 1960 and 1990, residential buildings represent an important sector in the energy consumption and economic growth of the country. Global warming and changes in the climate system has an important impact in building stock. The European Union is concerned about the scale of the consequences and has encouraged energy efficiency in buildings by mandating the Energy Performance Building Directive for all European countries [1]. In my opinion, {{it is the responsibility of}} the architect to address the impact of existing residential buildings by retrofitting solutions with the aim of reducing the energy consumption and eventually improving the quality of life. Architects, in collaboration with energy experts, can work properly to provide effective solutions. With the guidance of the new directive, along with their personal knowledge and experience in energy efficiency they can help bring about increased energy building performance. In order to demonstrate how architects can implement such an energy retrofit plan, this thesis presents a short description of residential buildings constructed between 60 's - 80 'by presenting a typical building representing the current state of the Greek building stock, and by studying its energy consumption. An energy performance simulation of the building with different energy simulation software considers different scenarios and describes a way to reduce energy demand and increase comfort in these buildings. The primary software tools used in the study was TEE KENAK, developed by the Greek chamber in accordance with the European energy rating tools for the implementation of the Energy Performance Building <b>Directive.</b> <b>Additional</b> software tools, including ECOtect, and the "Energy Performance Calculator", developed by the department of High Performance Buildings at the Georgia Institute of Technology in order to verify the information provided by the actual energy bills and the TEE KENAK.

Eighteen of a total of 44 physicians listed as attending accounted for the 33 cases in which the record indicates that the advance directive was recognized. Twelve of these 135 patients were coded during their hospitalization. Three of the 12 were coded in the ER upon admission, the remaining 9 were coded {{in the course of their}} care in the acute care hospital. Regarding code status a three tiered (Cat I, II, III) classification system was in place. Initial classification of the 135 patients upon admission was: 64 "full code" (I), 56 were "all but CPR" (II), 15 were "No code" (III). Code classification at the time of death (or discharge) was: I = 45, II = 53, III = 36.

SETTING: General Hospital of 274 beds. PATIENTS: 602 death charts reviewed, 135 contained indications or the execution of an advance directive.

RESULTS: 24 % of patients who had advance directives in the chart or at the physicians office had their directives recognized during their final hospitalization. In 68 / 135 (50 %) of the cases the conditions to activate the advance directive were met. And in 33 / 68 (49 %) of those cases the advanced directive was invoked. There was some, but less than expected correlation between advanced directives and DNR orders. In a three tiered Code Category Classification system (Cat. I, full code, Cat. II Chemical Code, Cat. III, No Code.) the initial classifications in the 135 cases with evidence of advance directives were Cat. I 47 %, Cat. II 42 %, and Cat. III 11 %. Compared to 59 cases where there was no indication of an advance directive the classifications were Cat. I 67 %, Cat. II 26 % and Cat. III 7 %. However, the classifications in the two groups at the time of death of the patients were Cat. I 34 % & 31 %, Cat. II 39 % & 39 % and Cat. III 27 % & 30 %. There was a 20 % increased incidence of an initial classification of full code in the cases without indication of an advance directive. But once the patient care involved review of code status, the final classifications of patients were the same irrespective of the presence of an advance directive. CONCLUSIONS: In 50 % or 68 / 135 of the cases the patient met the conditions for invocation of the advance directive and in 33 or 49 % of those cases the advance directive was invoked. Another way to state the impact of advance directives in the population studied is that in 22 % of the 602 deaths there was indication of an advance directive and in 50 % of those cases the directive became relevant and in 49 % of those cases it had a bearing on the care (or in 5 % of the 602 death studied). More research is needed to determine why advance directives are not utilized more and why they to do not have greater effect on clinical care decisions in terminal patients. But problems with making them available to relevant parties, hospital record keeping, and physician recognition of their significance are evident...|$|R
40|$|The term ‘emerging contaminants’ is {{generally}} {{used to refer}} to compounds previously not considered or known to be significant to groundwater (in terms of distribution and/or concentration) which are now being more widely detected. As analytical techniques improve, previously undetected organic micropollutants are being observed in the aqueous environment. Many emerging contaminants remain unregulated, but the number of regulated contaminants will continue to grow slowly over the next several decades. There is a wide variety of sources and pathways for these compounds to enter the environment and these include agriculture and urban areas. Some of these contaminants can have human or ecological health effects and {{there is a need for}} better understanding of their fate in environmental systems. This report provides a short review of the types of organic micropollutants which can be found in the aqueous environment. These include nanomaterials, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, industrial additives and by-products, personal care products and fragrances, water treatment by-products, flame/fire retardants and surfactants, as well as caffeine and nicotine metabolites and hormones. Many of the compounds are relatively small polar molecules which are not effectively removed by conventional drinking water treatment using activated carbon. Pesticides and some industrial compounds are presently covered by the Water Framework Directive, the Groundwater Regulations and the Drinking Water <b>Directive.</b> <b>Additional</b> parameters, such as bisphenol A and nonyl-phenol are anticipated to be covered by revisions to the Drinking Water Directive. Others are currently unregulated. In order to assess the hazards presented by such compounds, information on usage, persistence, leachability and a robust sensitive analytical method is required. The UK metaldehyde problem was not originally discovered due to lack of an analytical method and was exacerbated by recalcitrance in water treatment. For many pesticides these requirements are fulfilled and an assessment of risk of leaching to groundwater can be made. However, for pesticide metabolites this information can be sparse and for compounds such as pharmaceuticals it can be lacking. A simple hazard assessment for currently approved pesticides was made from information on UK usage, persistence, sorption to soil carbon and published leaching indices. The following compounds were assessed as having the greatest potential for leaching to water: 2, 4 -D, amidosulfuron, bentazone, clopyralid, dicamba, florasulam, fosthiazate, imazaquin, iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, maleic hydrazide, MCPA, MCPP-P, metribuzin, metsulfuronmethyl, quinmerac, oxamyl, and triclopyr with a further 46 also having potential. Of these, 19 had an octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow) less than that of metaldehyde and therefore are likely to be incompletely removed by water treatment. A simple assessment for pesticide metabolites, based only on organic carbon/water partition coefficient (Koc) and persistence data, in this study gave results which agreed in principle with other studies. The different approaches indicate that the metabolites of chlorothalonil, cyanazine, diflufenican, flufenacet, iodosulfuron-methyl, metaldehyde, metazachlor and metsulfuron-methyl are likely to pose the greatest risk to drinking water. In many cases these metabolites are derived from parents which have a lesser risk. Other organic micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, cannot as yet be assessed in the same way due to a lack of persistence data since the majority of persistence studies have been directed at water treatment. A range of organic micropollutants from urban settings have been detected in ground and surface water. Commonly detected compounds include: bisphenol A, carbamazepine, galaxolide, ibuprofen, iopamidol, phthalates, phenyl ethoxylates, and sulfamethoxazole. Case studies show that a small number of contaminants may be used to characterise the contaminant loading and also be used to assess the migration pathways in urban areas. Data interpreted by BGS from the Environment Agency’s monitoring programme for organic pollutants indicates that the 30 most frequently detected compounds comprise both established and emerging compounds and include a number of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, petroleum compounds, triazine herbicides, chlorinated solvents, degradation products and THMs, caffeine, DEET and industrial compounds such as bisphenol A and tributyl phosphate. Specific determinands include a range of currently licensed and phased out pesticides with a few metabolites, pharmaceuticals including carbamazepine and triclosan, caffeine, nicotine and food additives and alkyl phosphates. These data exhibit hot spots which may indicate possible research areas. Future research should focus on a compound identified in the literature and detected by Environment Agency monitoring. Possible topics could be a study of migration through the unsaturated zone. In many cases the mechanism for migration of emerging contaminants from the surface to groundwater is very unclear...|$|R
