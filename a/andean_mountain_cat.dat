5|$|More {{than ten}} species of mammals have been {{observed}} in the park, several of them endangered, including the colocolo, the <b>Andean</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>cat,</b> the spectacled bear, the taruca deer, the vicuña, the white-tailed deer, the puma, the northern viscacha, the long-tailed weasel, the hog-nosed skunk and the Andean fox.|$|E
5|$|In the two-volume sequel Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode, Ichigo and Masaya move to England {{to study}} {{endangered}} species. The remaining Mew Mews continue {{to eliminate the}} Chimera Animas {{left behind by the}} aliens. They face a new threat {{in the form of the}} Saint Rose Crusaders: humans with special powers who desire to conquer the world and create a utopia while taking over the remaining Chimera Animas. Berry Shirayuki becomes the sixth Mew Mew and temporarily takes Ichigo's place as the leader. Berry is the first Mew Mew to be infused with the DNA of two endangered species, the <b>Andean</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>cat</b> and the Amami rabbit. As one of the strongest Mew Mews, Berry is targeted by two of the Crusaders, who attack her at school. Ichigo returns to provide assistance during this battle. For their final attack, two Crusaders hypnotize the citizens of Tokyo and set them against the Mew Mews. Berry and her childhood friend Tasuku Meguro use their new-found feelings of love to reverse the hypnosis and cause a change of heart in the Crusaders.|$|E
50|$|Camelids, such as llamas, alpacas, vicuñas, {{are found}} in this ecoregion. Other mammals include the cougar, <b>Andean</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>cat,</b> Andean fox, and the Andean hairy armadillo.|$|E

50|$|<b>Andean</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>cats</b> occur localized. Their {{habitat in}} the Andes is {{fragmented}} by deep valleys, and their preferred prey, mountain viscachas (Lagidium) occur in patchy colonies.Across this range, {{the level of}} genetic diversity is very low.|$|R
50|$|<b>Andean</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>cats</b> {{occur only}} at high {{elevations}} in the Andes. Records in Argentina {{indicate that they}} live at elevations from 1800 m in the southern Andes to over 4000 m in Chile, Bolivia and central Peru. This terrain is arid, sparsely vegetated, rocky and steep. The population in the Salar de Surire Natural Monument was estimated at five individuals {{in an area of}} 250 km2. Results of a survey in the Jujuy Province of northwestern Argentina indicates a density of seven to 12 individuals per 100 km2 at an elevation of about 4200 m.|$|R
5000|$|Some mammals {{native to}} the reserve are: the llama, the alpaca, the vicuña, the guanaco, the taruca, the vizcacha, the puma, the <b>Andean</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>cat,</b> the {{colocolo}} and the Andean fox.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>cat</b> has a black {{nose and}} lips, and rounded ears. On {{the back and}} on the tail, the hair is 40-45 mm long. Its rounded {{footprints}} are 4 cm long and 3.5 cm wide. Its pads are covered with hair.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{being the}} chief food {{source of the}} <b>Andean</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>cat,</b> the {{southern}} viscacha is often hunted for its meat and fur, {{but it is still}} a very common species. Its population is not thought to be declining at a rate to warrant significant concern.|$|E
50|$|The western {{mountains}} {{are home to}} animals including the llama, guanaco and vicuña which {{are among the most}} recognizable species of South America.

5000|$|Genetic studies {{indicate}} the genus Leopardus forms a distinct clade within the feline subfamily, and first evolved in South America around 10 to 12e {{million years ago}} (Mya). Within the genus, two distinct evolutionary lineages appear to exist; one leading to the ocelot, margay, and <b>Andean</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>cat,</b> and the other leading to the remaining species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>cat</b> and {{pampas cat}} look similar. This makes it {{difficult}} to identify which cat is observed and makes correct estimations of populations problematic. This can be especially difficult when attempting to gain correct information from the observations of individuals that have seen one of these cats but are not aware to look for specific features to distinguish between the two.|$|E

40|$|The central {{origin of}} the potato (Solanum tuberosum) is Lake Titicaca of the central Andean highlands. People living in the <b>Andean</b> <b>mountains</b> utilize potato for staple food from ancient times. According to the {{previous}} studies, {{the distribution of the}} wild species related with the cultivars is human- induced environment such as roadside, cultivated fields, Inca ruins and garbage dumps. However, the mankind marched to the <b>Andean</b> <b>mountains</b> before approximately 10 thousand years. Before mankind's arrivals, the wild species of potato grew in the <b>Andean</b> <b>mountains.</b> We focus on the dung piles of vicuña (Vicugna vicugna) of Camelidae animal for the gene cradles for Solanum species. One of the wild species, Solanum acaule, establishes the colonies at the dung piles of vicuña. They absorb the nitrogen from the abundant soil nutrients of the dung piles for both vegetative and seed reproduction. The tuber growth of the Solanum cultivar is related with the rich nutrition use of the wild species growing in the dung piles of Camelidae animals...|$|R

50|$|San Guillermo National Park (Parque Nacional San Guillermo) is a {{national}} park in Argentina, in the Iglesia Department of San Juan Province. It was established in 1999 and {{is part of the}} San Guillermo Biosphere Reserve. The highest point of the biosphere reserve is about 6000 m. It consists of grasslands, wetlands, and canyons. The animals there include vicuña, guanaco, culpeo fox, <b>Andean</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>cat,</b> cougar, and Andean condor.|$|E
50|$|It is preyed {{on by the}} <b>Andean</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>cat</b> (Leopardus jacobitus), the {{colocolo}} (Leopardus colocolo), and the culpeo (Lycalopex culpaeus) in high-altitude desert regions. The northern viscacha is {{more often}} found on larger, steeper portions of cliffs. This preference is probably driven by a need to avoid predators, as land-based carnivores are more easily evaded on a steep slope. It rarely ventures far from rocks, as these provide a means of escaping from both aerial and terrestrial predators.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1998, {{the only}} {{evidence}} of this cat's existence was two photographs. It was then that Jim Sanderson took up his quest to find the <b>Andean</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>cat.</b> Sanderson sighted and photographed one in Chile in 1998 near Chile's northern border with Peru. In 2004, he joined a Bolivian research team and helped radio-collar an Andean cat in Bolivia. In April 2005, this cat was found dead, perhaps after being caught in a poacher's trap.|$|E
