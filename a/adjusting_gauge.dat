40|$|It {{has been}} {{known for a long time}} that many cues {{contribute}} to the perception of 3 D shape from 2 D images, such as shape from shading, textures, occlusions or reflection of the surrounding environment. However, little is known about the influence of lighting conditions on the correct mental reconstruction of 3 D shapes. In order to investigate this, we have run a set of experiments asking participants to report differences in surface orientation of unknown, smooth surfaces, using different methods. The first experiment consisted of a 2 AFC in which subjects had to identify which of two test objects had the same shape as the target. The stimuli were computer generated irregularly-shaped smooth surfaces, illuminated by a single point light source. For both test stimuli, the position of the light sources could either be different from or the same as the target. Results show that, as the amount of shape difference became smaller, participants were more and more biased towards choosing the match shape lit by the same source as the target. In the second experiment, participants had to report the perceived orientation of the surfaces at various locations by <b>adjusting</b> <b>gauge</b> figures [...] The surfaces could either be the same or slightly different and the light source of each shape could either be the same or offset by 90 degrees horizontally. Participants’ matches revealed large differences in perceived surface orientations when the lighting was different, even when the shapes were the same, confirming the first results. Our findings show that lighting conditions can play a substantial role in the perception of 3 D structure of objects from their 2 D representation. We also discuss the implication of this in the domain of computer aided visualisation...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper reviews {{geosynthetic}} reinforcement strain {{measurement techniques}} {{that have been}} reported in a database of well-documented case studies and more recent full-scale laboratory test walls. Interpretation of strain measurements, accuracy of readings, and advantages and disadvantages of different techniques are discussed.

We examined to what extent these picture plane transformations gave rise to perceptual differences.

We externalised the percepts of the depicted objects by using a direct perceptual method: the gauge-figure method. Participants had to <b>adjust</b> a <b>gauge</b> figure so {{that it seemed to}} be painted {{on the surface of the}} depicted object. From an extensive set of settings collected this way, we computed for each picture the three-dimensional interpretation - or pictorial relief - of the depicted object. On the basis of this set of pictorial reliefs, we addressed the effects of mirror reflections and rotations of pictures on the shape percept of the depicted object. Mirror-reflecting a picture around the horizontal axis resulted in large differences in pictorial reliefs, whereas mirror-reflecting pictures around the vertical axis resulted in only small differences in pictorial reliefs. Clockwise 90 °, 180 °, and 270 ° rotation affected the pictorial relief significantly. In all cases, the differences between the pictorial reliefs could be resolved by affine transformations, and could thus be ascribed to different solutions of the depth ambiguities inherent in pictures. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A {{dramatic}} increase in the frequency and intensity of flood events in the city of Niamey, Niger, has been observed in the last decade. The Niger River exhibits a double outflow peak in Niamey. The first peak, is due to the rainfall occurring within about 500 km of Niamey. It has reached high values in recent years and caused four drastic flood events since 2000. This paper analyses the potential of satellite rainfall products combined with hydrological modelling to monitor these floods. The study focuses on the 125, 000 km(2) area in the vicinity of Niamey, where local runoff supplies the first flood. Six rainfall products are tested : a gauge only product the Climate Prediction Centre (CPC); two <b>gauge</b> <b>adjusted</b> satellite products the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Multi-Platform Analysis (TMPA 3 B 42 v 7) and the CPC regional product African Rainfall Estimate (RFE version 2); and three satellite only products, 3 B 42 RT, the CPC Morphing method (CMORPH) and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Network (PERSIANN). The products are first inter-compared over the region of interest. Differences in terms of rainfall amount, number of rainy days, spacial extension of the rainfall events and frequency distribution of the rain rates are highlighted. The satellite only products provide more rain than the <b>gauge</b> <b>adjusted</b> ones. The hydrological model ISBA-TRIP is forced with the six products and the simulated discharge is analysed and compared With the discharge observed in Niamey over the period 2000 to 2013. The simulations based on the satellite only rainfall produce an excess in the discharge. For flood prediction, the problem can be overcome by a prior adjustment of the products - as done here with probability matching - or by analysing the simulated discharge in terms of percentile or anomaly. All tested products exhibit some skills in detecting the relatively heavy rainfall that preceded the flood and in predicting that the 95 th percentile of the discharge (i. e., the flood alert level in Niamey) will be exceeded. These skills are however variable among products and the best overall results are obtained with the TMPA 3 B 42 products...|$|R

40|$|This book {{grew out}} of a set of lecture notes on {{gravitational}} Chern–Simons (CS) theories developed over the past decade for several schools and different audiences including graduate students and researchers. CS theories are gauge-invariant theories that can include gravity consistently. They are only defined in odd dimensions and represent a very special class of theories in the Lovelock family. Lovelock gravitation theories are the natural extensions of General Relativity for dimensions greater than four that yield second-order field equations for the metric. These theories also admit local supersymmetric extensions where supersymmetry is an off-shell symmetry of the action, as in a standard gauge theory. Apart from the arguments of mathematical elegance and beauty, the gravitational CS actions are exceptionally endowed with physical attributes that suggest the viability of a quantum interpretation. CS theories are gauge-invariant, scale-invariant and background independent; they have no dimensional coupling constants.

To address this goal, the study followed the following three research dimensions. First, we improved the characterization of rainfall retrieval uncertainty from instantaneous earth-orbiting platform passive microwave observations, which form the basis of the merged satellite products, by investigating the significance of conditioning an error model for NASA’s Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) rainfall algorithm (2 A 12) to near-surface soil moisture data derived from a land surface model. A two-dimensional satellite rainfall error model, SREM 2 D, was used to provide ensemble error representation of 2 A 12 rainfall using two different parameter calibration approaches: conditioning vs. not the SREM 2 D parameters to the surface soil wetness categories. The statistical analysis of model generated ensembles and associated error metrics showed better performance when surface wetness information is used in SREM 2 D.

Almost all of the variability resided in the slant; the relative spread in the slant was about 25 % (Weber fraction). The tilt was reproduced with a typical spread of about 10 †. The rank correlation of the slant settings of different observers was high, thus the slant settings of different subjects were monotonically related. The variability could be predicted from the scatter in repeated settings by the individual observers. Although repeated settings by a single observer agreed within 5 %, observers did not agree {{on the value of}} the slant, even on the average. Scaling factors of a doubling in the depth dimension were encountered between different subjects.

Results highlight the importance of barotropic dynamics on coastal sea level changes on interannual and decadal time scales; they also have implications for diagnosing the uncertainties in current ocean reanalyses, using tide gauge records to infer past changes in ocean circulation, and identifying the physical mechanisms responsible for projected future regional sea level rise.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{benefits}} of integrating coarse resolution satellite-derived precipitation estimates with quasi-point rain gauge data for generating a fine spatial resolution precipitation map product. To integrate the two precipitation data sources, a geostatistical downscaling and integration approach is presented that can account for the differences in spatial resolution between data from different supports and adjusts inherent errors in the coarse resolution precipitation estimates. First, coarse resolution precipitation estimates are downscaled at a fine spatial resolution via area-to-point kriging to allow direct comparison with rain gauge data. Second, the downscaled precipitation estimates are integrated with the rain gauge data by multivariate kriging. In particular, errors in the coarse resolution precipitation estimates are <b>adjusted</b> against rain <b>gauge</b> data during this second stage. In this study, simple kriging with local means (SKLM) and kriging with an external drift (KED) are used as multivariate kriging algorithms. For comparative purposes, conditional merging (CM), a frequently-applied method for integrating rain gauge data and radar precipitation, is also employed. From a case study with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3 B 43 monthly precipitation products acquired in South Korea from May–October in 2013, {{we found that the}} incorporation of TRMM data with rain gauge data did not improve prediction performance when the number of rain gauge data was relatively large. However, the benefit of integrating TRMM and rain gauge data was most striking, regardless of multivariate kriging algorithms, when a small number of rain gauge data was used. These results indicate that the coarse resolution satellite-derived precipitation product would be a useful source for mapping precipitation at a fine spatial resolution if the geostatistical integration approach is applied to areas with sparse rain gauges...|$|R

The national railway network of Spain, Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Españoles (RENFE), was using Iberian gauge for all of its main lines, while those of France and Switzerland use standard gauge. As a result of this break-of-gauge, train journeys between Geneva and Barcelona consisted of two separate parts, with travelers having to change from a French to a Spanish train or vice versa at the border—at Portbou (alternatively written as Port Bou) on southbound trains and at Cerbère on northbound trains. In 1968, this was resolved with the introduction of the Talgo III RD trainsets, which featured variable gauge wheelsets. At Portbou station, the wheel spacing of each passenger carriage was <b>adjusted</b> by a <b>gauge</b> changer for the difference in gauge, and passengers no longer had to change trains. After successful test runs, the Catalan was extended from Port Bou to Barcelona as a through train on 1 June 1969, becoming the Catalan Talgo and upgraded to a Trans Europ Express (TEE). Most other rail journeys through this border crossing continued to require a change of train at Cerbère station or at Port Bou, as most trains did not use Talgo III RD trainsets.|$|R
40|$|Precipitation is {{one major}} {{variable}} for many applications. Satellite retrieval systems, raingauge network and radar systems are complement {{to each other}} in terms of their coverage and capability of monitoring precipitation. Satellite rainfall estimates systems produce data with global coverage that can provide information in areas for which data from other sources are unavailable. Without referring to ground measurement, satellite-based estimates can be bias. Although some <b>gauged</b> <b>adjusted</b> satellite precipitation products are developed, an effective way of integrating multi-sources of precipitation information is still a challenge. In this study we select a specific area in Sicily (Italy) having high density rain gauges to evaluate of satellite precipitation products. Sicily has an area of 26, 000 sq. km and the gauge density of the network considered in this study is about 250 sq. km/gauge. It is an island in the Mediterranean sea with a particular climatology and morphology, which is considered as an interesting test site for satellite precipitation products on the European mid-latitude area. Three products (CMORPH, PERSIANN, TRMM_ 3 B 42) have been selected for the evaluation. Evaluation and comparisons between selected products is performed with reference to the data provided by the gauge network of Sicily and using statistical and visualization tools. Considerations about differences between the point estimation given by gauges and the gridded surface provided by satellites are discussed as well as the difference between an evaluation based on point estimation and an evaluation based on interpolated data. An analysis of typical interpolation methods used for hydrometerological purposes have been done to choose the most appropriate method considering size of grid satellite data and the density of gauge network. Finally natural neighbor interpolation procedure was adopted to obtain gridded surface data with the same resolution of satellite products. Hypothetical relationship between elevation and results is investigated as well as presence of particular patterns and goodness of extremes detection. Results show that bias is considerable for all satellite products and extremes are rarely well captured. Analysis is described referring to the developing of a local system to get precipitation information for scientific and modeling purpose. It is evaluated the opportunity to elaborate a corrected product applying a bias correction procedure that would improve the quality of final data...|$|R
