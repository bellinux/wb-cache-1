Den manages to persuade her to give their marriage another try, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in Walford with him. She is shocked to discover he has children, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) and Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Johnson), and {{that while he was}} in Spain with her, he was in exile after faking his own death. She starts work as a hairdresser in Kate Mitchell's (Jill Halfpenny) nail salon and helps stepdaughter Vicki with her plans to enter fashion school. However, Den's elusive behaviour raises her suspicions that he is having an affair. He almost convinces her that she is mistaken, but she eventually learns that her fears were correct and uncovers the affair between Den and Kate. Feigning friendship, she hacks off most of Kate's hair and smashes up the beauty salon in a rage. She leaves Walford distraught at Den's betrayal.|$|E
40|$|Mentoring is {{important}} in the career development of novice and experienced nurses. With the anticipated shortage in nursing, it {{is important}} to explore factors such as mentoring that may contribute <b>to</b> career satisfaction <b>and</b> intent <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in the profession. This study explored the effects of mentoring on career satisfaction <b>and</b> intent <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in nursing, <b>and</b> the relationship between career satisfaction <b>and</b> intent <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in nursing. It was conducted through a mailed survey of RNs 55 years or younger currently in practice, education, administration, or research. Career satisfaction was measured through the use of the newly developed Mariani Nursing Career Satisfaction Scale. Findings revealed no statistically significant effect of mentoring on career satisfaction <b>and</b> intent <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in nursing. There was a statistically significant relationship between career satisfaction <b>and</b> intent <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in nursing. The majority of nurses reported participating in a mentoring relationship. Although the findings related to mentoring, career satisfaction, <b>and</b> intent <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> were not statistically significant, there was a prevalence of mentoring in nursing, thus suggesting the need for future research to identify outcomes of mentoring. In addition, the study contributed a newly developed instrument to measure the concept of career satisfaction in nursing...|$|R

25|$|On {{the eve of}} the Revolution, 95 {{percent of}} the American {{population}} lived outside the cities—much to the frustration of the British, who were able to capture the cities with their Royal Navy, but lacked the manpower to occupy and subdue the countryside. In explaining the importance of the cities in shaping the American Revolution, Benjamin Carp compares the important role of waterfront workers, taverns, churches, kinship networks, and local politics. Historian Gary B. Nash emphasizes the role of the working class, and their distrust of their betters, in northern ports. He argues that working class artisans and skilled craftsmen made up a radical element in Philadelphia that took control of the city starting about 1770 and promoted a radical Democratic form of government during the revolution. They held power for a while, and used their control of the local militia disseminate their ideology to the working class <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in power until the businessmen staged a conservative counterrevolution.|$|E
25|$|Facing {{their second}} West Coast game {{in as many}} weeks, the Patriots elected to {{practice}} at San José State University <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in Santa Clara, California in advance of flying to San Diego to face the Chargers in a Sunday night game at Qualcomm Stadium. On the first play of the game, Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers completed a 48-yard pass to wide receiver Vincent Jackson that brought the Chargers to the Patriots' 32-yard line. Three incomplete passes by Rivers from the Patriots' 7-yard line set up a 25-yard Nate Kaeding field goal that gave the Chargers a 3–0 lead. On their first possession, the Patriots reached the Chargers' 31-yard line, where Gostkowski missed a 48-yard field goal, his first such miss of the season. Four plays later, Rivers hit wide receiver Malcom Floyd on a 49-yard touchdown catch that extended the Chargers' lead to 10–0. The Patriots punted on their ensuing possession; the Chargers' Darren Sproles returned the punt 28 yards to start the Chargers' next drive from the Patriots' 45-yard line. A failed third-down conversion by the Chargers set up a missed 44-yard field goal attempt by Kaeding.|$|E

Testing of the research model is conducted using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analytical techniques. The result of the testing using SEM shows that the model is fit while from the hypothesis testing results indicate that distributive justice proved to have a significant positive effect on job satisfaction <b>and</b> intention <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> career plateau proved to have no significant effect on job satisfaction <b>and</b> intention <b>to</b> stay; <b>and</b> job satisfaction proved to have a significant positive effect on the intention <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b> ...|$|R

In the Fort Wilson Riot of October 4, men attacked James Wilson, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was accused of being a Loyalist sympathizer.
