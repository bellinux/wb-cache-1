50|$|Generally, tumor viruses cause {{little or}} no disease after {{infection}} in their hosts, or cause non-neoplastic diseases such as acute hepatitis for hepatitis B virus or mononucleosis for Epstein-Barr virus. A minority of persons (or animals) {{will go on to}} develop cancers after infection. This has complicated efforts {{to determine whether or not}} a given virus causes cancer. The well-known Koch's postulates are 19th-century constructs developed by Robert Koch to establish the likelihood that Bacillus anthracis will cause anthrax disease and are not applicable to viral diseases. (Firstly, this is because viruses cannot truly be isolated in pure culture—even stringent isolation techniques cannot exclude undetected contaminating viruses with similar density characteristics, and viruses must be grown on cells. Secondly, <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>virus</b> infection and <b>carriage</b> is the norm for most tumor viruses, which violates Koch's third principle. Relman and Fredericks have described the difficulties in applying Koch's postulates to virus-induced cancers. Finally, the host restriction for human viruses makes it unethical to experimentally transmit a suspected cancer virus.) Other measures, such as A.B. Hill's criteria, are more relevant to cancer virology but also have some limitations in determining causality.|$|R
40|$|Background: Hemorrhagic fever with renal {{syndrome}} (HFRS) is {{an important}} infectious disease in Hebei province, China. The average annual incidence is 3. 10 / 100000. Although the incidence of HFRS is stable with a general decline in trend since 2004, {{an increase in the}} trend was observed in 2011. Few studies have been conducted to investigate the underlying risk factors for this disease. Methods: The epidemiological data of HFRS and the population data, meteorology, and remote sensing aspects of cities in Hebei province from 1999 to 2011 were collected. The epidemiological data included the population density in the region, seasonal data and rat density and rat’s <b>virus</b> <b>carriage</b> rate. The data were analyzed by descriptive study, correlation analysis and multivariate linear analysis. Results: There were 26837 cases of HFRS was reported from 1999 to 2011. The infection occurred mainly in males, aged 20, 49 years, who were farmers. Rattus norvegicus was the main host animal. The incidence of HFRS was related to NDVI value, rat density and rat’s <b>virus</b> <b>carriage</b> rate by multiple linear regression (F = 25. 936, P, 0. 01). The pseudo- R 2 value for the model was 0. 644. Conclusion: The incidence of HFRS was related to NDVI value, rat density and rat’s <b>virus</b> <b>carriage</b> rate. Control of these factors should be used to prevent HFRS in Hebei province...|$|R

40|$|Herpes simplex {{virus and}} varicella-zoster virus are common infections and are seen {{frequently}} in clinical practice. Infection with these viruses results in cutaneous lesions {{that may be}} diagnosed clinically, but widely available laboratory testing is useful for confirmation. <b>Asymptomatic</b> herpes simplex <b>virus</b> shedding, or "subclinical reactivation," likely occurs in all persons infected with herpes simplex virus and results in the transmission of virus {{despite the absence of}} signs or symptoms that suggest active infection. Oral and intravenous acyclovir are effective in treating initial and recurrent herpes simplex and varicella-zoster virus infections. The daily administration of oral acyclovir as suppressive therapy is effective in patients with frequently recurring genital infection with herpes simplex virus by reducing the number of symptomatic recurrences and the frequency of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>virus</b> shedding. Two new antiviral agents, famciclovir and valacyclovir hydrochloride, have been approved for the short-term treatment of recurrent genital herpes simplex virus and recurrent zoster in nonimmunocompromised hosts. Famciclovir and valacyclovir demonstrate superior pharmacokinetics compared with acyclovir and allow for less frequent daily dosing with higher achievable serum drug concentrations.

COBS rats were inoculated with the virus via the intranasal route and subsequently infected with S. ratti. The larvae and eggs found in the feces collected from these rats were allowed to develop in vitro. These second generation filariform larvae were then inoculated subcutaneously into COBS mice. At necropsy, 5 - 8 days postinoculation, swine influenza virus was isolated from 15 % of the mouse lungs. In control studies, swine influenza virus was not isolated from the feces of the COBS rats which served as a source of both unexposed and exposed S. ratti. Swine influenza virus was recovered in vitro from S. ratti homogenates. It is suggested that this laboratory model be used to study more closely the various aspects of the ecology of virus-helminth relationships in vertebrate hosts. 19867299 PMC 213844...|$|R

Of the 117 cases, 37 lived in, or had visited, the Sorell Municipal Area, east of Hobart.

40|$|AbstractThe VP 2 gene of {{infectious}} pancreatic necrosis virus, encoded in an expression plasmid and encapsulated in alginate microspheres, was used for oral DNA vaccination of fish {{to better understand the}} carrier state and the action of the vaccine. The efficacy of the vaccine was evaluated by measuring the prevention of virus persistence in the vaccinated fish that survived after waterborne virus challenge. A real-time RT-qPCR analysis revealed lower levels of IPNV-VP 4 transcripts in rainbow trout survivors among vaccinated and challenged fish compared with the control virus group at 45 days post-infection. The infective virus was recovered from <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>virus</b> control fish, but not from the vaccinated survivor fish, suggesting an active role of the vaccine in the control of IPNV infection. Moreover, the levels of IPNV and immune-related gene expression were quantified in fish showing clinical infection as well as in asymptomatic rainbow trout survivors. The vaccine mimicked the action of the virus, although stronger expression of immune-related genes, except for IFN- 1 and IL 12, was detected in survivors from the virus control (carrier) group than in those from the vaccinated group.

A systematic search for relevant literature was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. 31 studies were identified. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS) were never isolated in Hajj pilgrims. The viruses most commonly isolated from symptomatic patients during the Hajj by PCR were rhinovirus (5. 9 - 48. 8 % prevalence), followed by influenza virus (4. 5 - 13. 9 %) and non-MERS coronaviruses (2. 7 - 13. 2 %) with most infections due to coronavirus 229 E; other viruses were less frequently isolated. Several viruses including influenza A, rhinovirus, and non-MERS coronaviruses had low carriage rates among arriving pilgrims and a statistically significant increase in their carriage rate was observed, following participation in the Hajj.

40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{is found}} {{frequently}} in certain epithelial pathologies, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and oral hairy leukoplakia, {{indicating that the}} virus can infect epithelial cells in vivo. Recent studies of cell lines imply that epithelial cells may {{also play a role}} in persistent EBV infection in vivo. In this report, we show the establishment and characterization of an ex vivo culture model of tonsil epithelial cells, a likely site for EBV infection in vivo. Primary epithelial-cell cultures, generated from tonsil explants, contained a heterogeneous mixture of cells with an ongoing process of differentiation. Keratin expression profiles were consistent with the presence of cells from both surface and crypt epithelia. A small subset of cells could be latently infected by coculture with EBV-releasing cell lines, but not with cell-free virus. We also detected viral-DNA, -mRNA, and -protein expression in cultures from EBV-positive tonsil donors prior to in vitro infection. We conclude that these cells were either already infected at the time of explantation or soon after through cell-to-cell contact with B cells replicating EBV in the explant. Taken together, these findings suggest that the tonsil epithelium of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>virus</b> carriers is able to sustain EBV infection in vivo. This provides an explanation for the presence of EBV in naso- and oropharyngeal pathologies and is consistent with epithelial cells playing a role in the egress of EBV during persistent infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) to establish lifelong persistence and reactivate from latency {{is critical to}} its suc-cess as a pathogen. Here we describe a short-term in vitromodel representing the events surrounding HCMV latency and reacti-vation in circulating peripheral bloodmonocytes that was developed in order to study the immunological consequence of latent <b>virus</b> <b>carriage.</b> Infection of human CD 14 monocytes by HCMV resulted in the immediate establishment of latency, as evi-denced {{by the absence of}} particular lytic gene expression, the transcription of latency-associated mRNAs, and the maintenance of viral genomes. Latent HCMV induced cellular differentiation to a macrophage lineage, causing production of selective proin-flammatory cytokines andmyeloid-cell chemoattractants that most likely play a role in virus dissemination in the host. Analysis of global cellular gene expression revealed activation of innate immune responses and the modulation of protein and lipid syn-thesis to accommodate latent HCMV infection. Remarkably, monocytes harboring latent virus exhibited selective responses to secondary stimuli known to induce an antiviral state. Furthermore, when challenged with type I and II interferon, latently in-fected cells demonstrated a blockade of signaling at the level of STAT 1 phosphorylation. The data demonstrate that HCMV re-programs specific cellular pathways in monocytes, most notably innate immune responses, which {{may play a role in}} the estab-lishment of, maintenance of, and reactivation from latency.

We evaluated knowledge of <b>virus</b> <b>carriage</b> prevalence, needlestick injuries, venepuncture practices, and glove use among paediatricians in Wales and South West Regional Health Authorities. We also attempted to evaluate hepatitis B immunisation uptake in this group. Paediatricians have traditionally been considered a low risk group {{in the context of}} accidental occupational exposure to these viruses. We targeted a four point questionnaire at 221 paediatricians. Results suggested that despite recent increasing concern about these viruses, that is reflected in the amount of medical literature recently published, and the issuing of Department of Health guidelines on venepuncture, knowledge of prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B carriage rates, and hence assessment of risk magnitude, was surprisingly poor. Safe venepuncture practices were not widely used. In the 12 months before receiving the questionnaire 55 % had suffered a needlestick injury with only 10 % reporting the fact. Hepatitis B immunisation uptake was highest in the junior grades (but this does not necessarily mean those at greatest risk). There were many inconsistencies between the clinicians' perceptions of risk and their practices. As the virus attains a firm hold in the heterosexual population paediatricians by virtue of the nature of venepuncture in children will almost certainly see their risk of acquiring HIV/hepatis B viruses secondary to accidental occupational exposure increase over the next decade. Without an improvement in current knowledge of carriage prevalence in high risk areas and alteration in venepuncture practices/hepatitis B immunisation uptake some will unfortunately, though avoidably, contract these bloodborne viral infections...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of {{small amounts of}} viral pathogens in infected cells by classical PCR is hampered by a partial loss of virus nucleic acid due to extraction and by difficulties in discrimination between truly intracellular virus genome material and that possibly adhered to the cell surface. These impediments limit reliable identification of virus traces within infected cells, which are typically encountered in latent and persistent occult infections. In this study, hepadnavirus-specific in situ PCR combined with the enzymatic elimination of extracellular virus and flow cytometry permitted {{detection of}} viral genomes in lymphoid cells without nucleic acid isolation and allowed quantification of infected cells {{during the course of}} persistent infection with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV). The validity of the procedure was confirmed by hybridization analysis of the in situ-amplified viral sequences. The results showed that hepadnavirus can be directly detected within lymphoid cells not only in serologically accountable infection, but also years after recovery from viral hepatitis {{and in the course of}} primary occult <b>virus</b> <b>carriage.</b> Percentages of infected peripheral lymphoid cells in symptomatic WHV hepatitis fluctuate between 3. 4 and 20. 4 % (mean ± standard error of the mean, 9. 6 % ± 1. 7 %), whereas those in persistent, serologically mute WHV infection range from 1. 1 to 14. 6 % (mean ± standard error of the mean, 4. 8 % ± 0. 8 %) (P = 0. 005).
