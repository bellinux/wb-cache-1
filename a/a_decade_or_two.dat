25|$|The {{average age}} of onset of alcohol abuse was 29 years for the Core City men and 41 years for the College men. Full blown alcoholism, where it appeared, usually lasted <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> before sobriety was attained. The number of alcoholics {{increased}} steadily until age 40 {{and then began to}} decline at a rate of stable remission of 2 to 3% per year. Older alcoholics are relatively rare because of the rate of remission and a higher mortality rate.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the leads, {{which are}} small {{diameter}} wires, from the pacemaker to the implantation {{site in the}} heart muscle {{will need to be}} removed. The most common reason for lead removal is infection, however over time leads can degrade due to a number of reasons such as lead flexing. Changes to programming of the pacemaker may overcome lead degradation to some extent. However a patient who has several pacemaker replacements over <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> in which the leads were reused may require a lead replacement surgery.|$|E
25|$|The {{other end}} of a {{pacemaker}} lead is actually implanted into the heart muscle. In addition leads that have been implanted for <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> will usually have attachments to the patient's body at various places in the pathway from device to heart muscle since the human body tends to incorporate foreign devices into tissue. In some cases such as a device that has been inserted for {{a short amount of}} time, removal may involve simple traction to pull the lead from the body. Removal in other cases is typically done with a cutting device which threads over the lead and is moved down the lead to remove any organic attachments with tiny cutting lasers or similar device.|$|E

40|$|To us, as feminist professors, the {{structural}} inequality {{of women is}} obvious. To our nonfeminist students, however, this inequality is often invisible. They believe, optimistically, that all women 2 ̆ 7 s problems have been solved or will be {{by the time they}} complete their undergraduate education. They are firm believers that American society is egalitarian and radically different from the world of ten or twenty years ago. This book is oriented toward our students and our vision.

50|$|Taiwanese men who marry {{women from}} Southeast Asia are {{typically}} {{drawn from a}} less educated and disadvantaged population. While Taiwanese husbands {{tend to have more}} education than their Vietnamese brides, they still fall below the average levels of education in Taiwan. Many times a man can be more than <b>a</b> <b>decade,</b> <b>or</b> possibly <b>two</b> to three decades, older than his migrant bride. Seventy percent of Vietnamese brides are under 23 years of age, while over eighty percent of their Taiwanese grooms are aged over 30. All of these factors (lack of education, disadvantage, and advanced age) typically contribute to trouble in finding a bride locally and thus increase the desire to enter a migrant marriage. For many Taiwanese men, migrant marriages can seem like an easy solution to their household troubles, as a wife can act as a reproductive unit, a housekeeper, and a nurse to his parents. In one study, the percentage of women who reported “housework” as their primary occupation rose from 16.7% while located in Vietnam to 52.4% after being relocated to Taiwan. As can be seen in a woman’s primary motivation for marriage (“To help the family”), the Vietnamese have strong familial ties and practice high subservience to a patriarchal structure. This trait is highly prized by some Taiwanese men who feel that Taiwanese women are beginning to wrest away from the constraints of a patriarchal society.|$|R

500|$|Independence {{also did}} not result in stable {{political}} regimes, save in a few countries. First, the new nations did not have well-defined identities, but rather the process of creating identities was only beginning. This would be carried out through newspapers and the creation of national symbols, including new names for the countries ("Mexico", [...] "Colombia", [...] "Ecuador", [...] "Bolivia", [...] "Argentina"), that broke with the past. In addition, the borders were not firmly established, and the struggle between federalism and centralism, which began in independence, continued {{throughout the rest of the}} century. Two large states that emerged from the wars—Gran Colombia and the Federal Republic of Central America—collapsed after <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> and Argentina would not consolidate politically until the 1860s.|$|E
500|$|The reliquary exuberantly {{exploits}} the ronde bosse or [...] "encrusted" [...] enamelling technique, {{which involves}} creating small three-dimensional figures coated in enamel {{on a metal}} core, often just gold wire. [...] The technique was a recent innovation which the goldsmiths working for the Valois were pushing to its limits {{at the end of}} the 14th century. [...] The main colour of enamel used is a lead-based white, which had also only been developed <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> at most before the date of the reliquary, and was evidently very fashionable {{at the end of the}} century. [...] White dominates the few surviving large enamels in ronde bosse dated to the period beginning about 1380 and ending about 1410, used as here for both the clothes and flesh of the figures. [...] Gold is used for their hair, and other enamel colours are mostly used at the neck and cuffs to demarcate between white robes and white flesh; [...] "throughout, colour is used in a very considered way"; [...] "a controlled use of red includes the alternation of rubies and pearls", except where [...] "a single sapphire interrupts this rhythm" [...] above God the Father. [...] Blue, an important enamel colour in other works, is almost entirely absent here, perhaps so as not to overshadow the large sapphires.|$|E
30|$|Over {{more than}} one century {{beginning}} in the late 1800 ’s, Australia has exhibited a rich history of achievement in solar-terrestrial physics, ranging from simple geomagnetic measurements to sophisticated radars and satellite payloads. These endeavours have been supported by competent and continuing theoretical and modelling programs. Beginning {{at the time of the}} Second World War applied research was fostered by close collaboration between UK, Australian and New Zealand physicists which later included the USA. As a consequence, great progress was made in association with the World War II effort and this continued through until the 1960 ’s, and was a time when Australia was at the forefront of international STP research. An advantage over this period was, due the history evolving over the previous three decades that political implications were largely and conveniently absent from scientific planning and implementation. However, in the following three decades, until the end of the century, there was significant investment from the Australian Federal Government to expand research with applied research increasing, albeit supported with only modest private industry investment. In the new millennium, more emphasis has been placed on large projects. For example, the future multibillion dollar astronomical telescope, the Square Kilometre Array Project (SKA 2015) under development coupled with the need for detailed knowledge of ionospheric variability to interpret astronomical sky maps, suggests the possibility of <b>a</b> healthy <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> of STP research ahead.|$|R

[...] In addition, no other photograph with the same painted backdrop has been found. Several photographers passed through Fort Robinson and the Red Cloud Agency in 1877—including James H. Hamilton, Charles Howard, David Rodocker and possibly Daniel S. Mitchell—but none used the backdrop that appears in the tintype. After the death of Crazy Horse, Private Charles Howard produced at least two images of the famed war leader's alleged scaffold grave, located near Camp Sheridan, Nebraska.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1970s a few paleoclimatologists were {{concerned}} {{with the possibility of}} global cooling, and suggested that the next glacial period could be rapidly approaching. The previous interglacial periods seemed to have lasted about 10,000 years each; a report in 1972 assuming that the present interglacial period would be equally long concluded, [...] "it is likely that the present-day warm epoch will terminate relatively soon if man does not intervene". Since then, our understanding of the climate system has improved. It is known that not all interglacial periods are of the same length and that solar heating varies in a non-linear fashion forced by the Milankovitch orbital cycles (see Causes section above). At the same time, it is also known that greenhouse gases are increasing in concentration with each passing year. Based on the variations in solar heating and on the amount of [...] in the atmosphere, some calculations of future temperatures have been made. According to these estimates, the interglacial period Earth is in now may persist for another 50,000 years if [...] levels increase to 750 parts per million (ppm) while the recent atmospheric concentration of [...] is about 407 ppm by volume. If [...] drops instead to 210 ppm, then the next glacial period may only be 15,000 years away. Moreover, studies of seafloor sediments and ice cores from glaciers around the world, namely Greenland, indicate that climatic change is not smooth. Studies of isotopic composition of the ice cores indicate the change from warm to frigid temperatures can occur in <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> In addition, the ice cores show that an ice age is not uniformly cold, nor are interglacial periods uniformly warm (see also stadial). Analysis of ice cores of the entire thickness of the Greenland glacier shows that climate over the last 250,000 years has changed frequently and abruptly. The present interglacial period (the last 10,000 to 15,000 years) has been fairly stable and warm, but the previous one was interrupted by numerous frigid spells lasting hundreds of years. If the previous period was more typical than the present one, the period of stable climate in which humans flourished—inventing agriculture and thus civilization—may have been possible only because of a highly unusual period of stable temperature.|$|E
