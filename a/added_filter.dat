40|$|The authors {{report on}} the imaging {{capabilities}} of a mammographic system demonstrator based on GaAs pixel detectors operating in single photon counting (SPC) mode. The system imaging performances have been assessed {{by means of the}} transfer functions: The modulation transfer function (MTF), the normalized noise power spectrum, and the detective quantum efficiency (DQE) have been measured following the guidelines of the IEC 62220 - 1 - 2 protocol. The transfer function analysis has shown the high spatial resolution capabilities of the GaAs detectors. The MTF calculated at the Nyquist frequency (2. 94 cycles/mm) is indeed 60 %. The DQE, measured with a standard mammographic beam setup (Mo/Mo, 28 kVp, with 4 mm Al <b>added</b> <b>filter)</b> and calculated at zero frequency, is 46 %. Aiming to further improve the system's image quality, the authors investigate the DQE limiting factors and show that they are mainly related to system engineering. For example, the authors show that optimization of the image equalization procedure increases the DQE(0) up to 74 %, which is better than the DQE(0) of most clinical mammographic systems. The authors show how the high detection efficiency of GaAs detectors and the noise discrimination associated with the SPC technology allow optimizing the image quality in mammography. In conclusion, the authors propose technological solutions to exploit to the utmost the potentiality of GaAs detectors coupled to SPC electronics...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} linear minimum mean square error-based (LMMSE) channel {{estimation}} method, which allows avoiding the necessary {{knowledge of the}} channel covariance matrix or its estimation. To do so, a perfectly tunable filter acting like an artificial channel is added at the receiver side. We show that an LMMSE estimation of the sum of this artificial channel and the physical channel only needs the covariance matrix of the artificial channel, and the channel estimation is finally obtained by subtracting the frequency coefficients of the <b>added</b> <b>filter.</b> We call this method artificial channel aided-LMMSE (ACA-LMMSE). Theoretical developments and simulations prove that its performance is close to theoretical LMMSE, and we show that this method reduces the computational complexity, compared to usual LMMSE, due to the covariance matrix used for ACA-LMMSE is computed only once throughout the transmission duration. We put the conditions on the artificial channel parameters to get the expected mask effect. Simulations display {{the performance of the}} proposed method, in terms of MMSE and bit error rate (BER).

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} pediatric {{image quality}} and radiation dose considerations in state-of-the-art fluoroscopic imaging equipment. Although most fluoroscopes {{are capable of}} automatically providing good image quality on infants, toddlers, and small children, excessive radiation dose levels can result from design deficiencies of the imaging device or inappropriate configuration of the equipment’s capabilities when imaging small body parts. Important design features and setup choices at installation and during the clinical use of the imaging device can improve image quality and reduce radiation exposure levels in pediatric patients. Pediatric radiologists and cardiologists, {{with the help of}} medical physicists, need to understand the issues involved in creating good image quality at reasonable pediatric patient doses. The control of radiographic technique factors by the generator of the imaging device must provide a large dynamic range of mAs values per exposure pulse during both fluoroscopy and image recording as a function of patient girth, which is the thickness of the patient in the posterior–anterior projection at the umbilicus (less than 10 cm to greater than 30 cm). The range of pulse widths must be limited to less than 10 ms in children to properly freeze patient motion. Variable rate pulsed fluoroscopy can be leveraged to reduce radiation dose to the patient and improve image quality. Three focal spots with nominal sizes of 0. 3 mm to 1 mm are necessary on the pediatric unit. A second, lateral imaging plane might be necessary because of the child’s limited tolerance of contrast medium. Spectral and spatial beam shaping can improve image quality while reducing the radiation dose. Finally, the level of entrance exposure to the image receptor of the fluoroscope as a function of operator choices, of <b>added</b> <b>filter</b> thickness, of selected pulse rate, of the selected field-of-view and of the patient girth all must be addressed at installation...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>added</b> <b>filters</b> including conventional and rare earth materials for dental radiography tasks was investigated using a simulation approach. Current study {{focuses on the}} combination of a range of various filters to investigate the reduction of radiation absorbed dose and improving the quality of a radiography image. To simulate the X-ray beam spectrum, a MCNP 5 code was applied. Relative intensity, beam quality, and mean energy were investigated for a typical dental radiography machine. The impact of different rare-earth materials with different thicknesses and tube voltages on the X-ray spectrum was investigated. For Aluminum as a conventional filter, the modeled X-ray spectra and HVL values were in a good agreement with those reported by IPEM. The results showed that for a 70 kVp voltage, with an increase of the thickness and atomic number of a given <b>added</b> <b>filters,</b> an increase of HVL values were observed. However, with the increase of the attenuator thickness, X-ray beam intensity decreases. For mean energy, different results were observed. It was also found that rare earth made filters reduce high energy X-ray radiation due to k-edge absorption. This leads to an ideal beam for intra-oral radiography tasks. However, as a disadvantage of rare earth <b>added</b> <b>filters,</b> the reduction of the tube output levels should also be considered.

40|$|Five {{laboratory}} incubation {{experiments were}} carried out to assess the salinity-induced changes in the microbial use of sugarcane filter cake added to soil. The first laboratory experiment was carried out to prove {{the hypothesis that the}} lower content of fungal biomass in a saline soil reduces the decomposition of a complex organic substrate in comparison to a non-saline soil under acidic conditions. Three different rates (0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 %) of sugarcane filter cake were added to both soils and incubated for 63 days at 30 °C. In the saline control soil without amendment, cumulative CO 2 production was 70 % greater than in the corresponding non-saline control soil, but the formation of inorganic N did not differ between these two soils. However, nitrification was inhibited in the saline soil. The increase in cumulative CO 2 production by adding filter cake was similar in both soils, corresponding to 29 % of the filter cake C at all three addition rates. Also the increases in microbial biomass C and biomass N were linearly related to the amount of filter cake added, but this increase was slightly higher for both properties in the saline soil. In contrast to microbial biomass, the absolute increase in ergosterol content in the saline soil was on average only half that in the non-saline soil and it showed also strong temporal changes during the incubation: A strong initial increase after adding the filter cake was followed by a rapid decline. The addition of filter cake led to immobilisation of inorganic N in both soils. This immobilisation was not expected, because the total C-to-total N ratio of the filter cake was below 13 and the organic C-to-organic N ratio in the 0. 5 M K 2 SO 4 extract of this material was even lower at 9. 2. The immobilisation was considerably higher in the saline soil than in the non-saline soil. The N immobilisation capacity of sugarcane filter cake should be considered when this material is applied to arable sites at high rations. The second incubation experiment was carried out to examine the N immobilizing effect of sugarcane filter cake (C/N ratio of 12. 4) and to investigate whether mixing it with compost (C/N ratio of 10. 5) has any synergistic effects on C and N mineralization after incorporation into the soil. Approximately 19 % of the compost C added and 37 % of the filter cake C were evolved as CO 2, assuming that the amendments had no effects on the decomposition of soil organic C. However, only 28 % of the <b>added</b> <b>filter</b> cake was lost according to the total C and d 13 C values. Filter cake and compost contained initially significant concentrations of inorganic N, which was nearly completely immobilized between day 7 and 14 of the incubation in most cases. After day 14, N re-mineralization occurred at an average rate of 0. 73 µg N g- 1 soil d- 1 in most amendment treatments, paralleling the N mineralization rate of the non-amended control without significant difference. No significant net N mineralization from the amendment N occurred in any of the amendment treatments in comparison to the control. The addition of compost and filter cake resulted in a linear increase in microbial biomass C with increasing amounts of C added. This increase was not affected by differences in substrate quality, especially the three times larger content of K 2 SO 4 extractable organic C in the sugarcane filter cake. In most amendment treatments, microbial biomass C and biomass N increased {{until the end of the}} incubation. No synergistic effects could be observed in the mixture treatments of compost and sugarcane filter cake. The third 42 -day incubation experiment was conducted to answer the questions whether the decomposition of sugarcane filter cake also result in immobilization of nitrogen in a saline alkaline soil and whether the mixing of sugarcane filter cake with glucose (adjusted to a C/N ratio of 12. 5 with (NH 4) 2 SO 4) change its decomposition. The relative percentage CO 2 evolved increased from 35 % of the added C in the pure 0. 5 % filter cake treatment to 41 % in the 0. 5 % filter cake + 0. 25 % glucose treatment to 48 % in the 0. 5 % filter cake + 0. 5 % glucose treatment. The three different amendment treatments led to immediate increases in microbial biomass C and biomass N within 6 h that persisted only in the pure filter cake treatment until the end of the incubation. The fungal cell-membrane component ergosterol showed initially an over-proportionate increase in relation to microbial biomass C that fully disappeared at the end of the incubation. The cellulase activity showed a 5 -fold increase after filter cake addition, which was not further increased by the additional glucose amendment. The cellulase activity showed an exponential decline to values around 4 % of the initial value in all treatments. The amount of inorganic N immobilized from day 0 to day 14 increased with increasing amount of C added in comparison to the control treatment. Since day 14, the immobilized N was re-mineralized at rates between 1. 31 and 1. 51 µg N g- 1 soil d- 1 in the amendment treatments and was thus more than doubled in comparison with the control treatment. This means that the re-mineralization rate is independent from the actual size of the microbial residues pool and also independent from the size of the soil microbial biomass. Other unknown soil properties seem to form a soil-specific gate for the release of inorganic N. The fourth incubation experiment was carried out with the objective of assessing the effects of salt additions containing different anions (Cl-, SO 42 -, HCO 3 -) on the microbial use of sugarcane filter cake and dhancha leaves amended to inoculated sterile quartz sand. In the subsequent fifth experiment, the objective was to assess the effects of inoculum and temperature on the decomposition of sugar cane filter cake. In the fourth experiment, sugarcane filter cake led to significantly lower respiration rates, lower contents of extractable C and N, and lower contents of microbial biomass C and N than dhancha leaves, but to a higher respiratory quotient RQ and to a higher content of the fungal biomarker ergosterol. The RQ was significantly increased after salt addition, when comparing the average of all salinity treatments with the control. Differences in anion composition had no clear effects on the RQ values. In experiment 2, the rise in temperature from 20 to 40 °C increased the CO 2 production rate by a factor of 1. 6, the O 2 consumption rate by a factor of 1. 9 and the ergosterol content by 60 %. In contrast, the contents of microbial biomass N decreased by 60 % and the RQ by 13 %. The effects of the inoculation with a saline soil were in most cases negative and did not indicate a better adaptation of these organisms to salinity. The general effects of anion composition on microbial biomass and activity indices were small and inconsistent. Only the fraction of 0. 5 M K 2 SO 4 extractable C and N in non-fumigated soil was consistently increased in the 1. 2 M NaHCO 3 treatment of both experiments. In contrast to the small salinity effects, the quality of the substrate has overwhelming effects on microbial biomass and activity indices, especially on the fungal part of the microbial community. Fünf Inkubationsexperimente wurden im Labor durchgeführt, um die versalzungs-induzierten Veränderungen in der mikrobiellen Nutzung von Zuckerrohr-Filterkuchen im Boden abzuschätzen. Das erste Laborexperiment wurde durchgeführte, um die Hypothese zu prüfen, dass der niedrigere Gehalt an Pilzbiomasse in einem salzhaltigen Boden die Zersetzung einer komplexen organischen Substanz reduziert im Vergleich zu einem nicht-salzhaltigen Boden unter sauren Bedingungen. Drei verschiedene Anteile (0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 %) des Zuckerrohr-Filterkuchens wurden zu beiden Böden gegeben und für 63 Tage bei 30 °C inkubiert. In dem salzhaltigen Kontrollboden ohne Zugabe war die kumulative CO 2 -Produktion um 70 % höher als in dem entsprechenden nicht-salzhaltigen Kontrollboden, aber die Bildung von anorganischem N unterschied sich zwischen den beiden Böden nicht. Jedoch war die Nitrifikation in dem salzhaltigen Boden gehemmt. Die Zunahme der kumulativen CO 2 -Produktion durch die Zugabe des Filterkuchens war in beiden Böden ähnlich und entsprach 29 % des Filterkuchen-Kohlenstoffs bei allen drei Zugabemengen. Auch die Zunahmen an C und N in mikrobieller Biomasse waren linear mit der Menge des zugegebenen Filterkuchens korreliert, aber diese Zunahme war für beide Eigenschaften etwas höher im salzhaltigen Boden. Im Gegensatz zur mikrobiellen Biomasse war die absolute Zunahme des Ergosterolgehalts im salzhaltigen Boden nur halb so hoch wie im nicht-salzhaltigen Boden und zeigte große zeitliche Veränderungen während der Inkubation. Einer starken anfänglichen Zunahme nach der Zugabe des Filterkuchens folgte eine rasche Abnahme. Die Zugabe von Filterkuchen führte zu einer Immobilisation von anorganischem N in beiden Böden. Diese Immobilisation war nicht erwartet worden, da das Ct/Nt-Verhältnis des Filterkuchens unter 13 lag und das Corg/Norg-Verhältnis im 0. 5 M K 2 SO 4 -Extrakt dieses Materials war mit 9. 2 sogar noch niedriger. Die N-Immobilisationskapazität von Zuckerrohr-Filterkuchen sollte berücksichtigt werden, wenn dieses Material in großen Mengen auf ackerbaulich genutzten Flächen ausgebracht wird. Der zweite Inkubationsversuch wurde durchgeführt, um den N-Immobilisationseffekt von Zuckerrohr-Filterkuchen (C/N-Verhältnis von 12. 4) zu prüfen und um zu untersuchen, ob das Beimischen mit Kompost (C/N-Verhältnis von 10. 5) synergistische Effekte auf die C- und N-Mineralisation nach der Inkorporation in den Boden hat. Ungefähr 19 % des zugeführten Kompost-Kohlenstoffs und 37 % des Filterkuchen-Kohlenstoffs wurden als CO 2 abgegeben. Dabei wurde angenommen, dass die Zugabe keinen Einfluss auf den Abbau des organischen Kohlenstoffs im Boden hat. Allerdings wurden nur 28 % des zugegebenen Filterkuchens auf der Basis der Ct- und d 13 C-Werte abgebaut. Filterkuchen und Kompost enthielten anfänglich signifikante Konzentrationen an anorganischem N, die zwischen dem 7. und 14. Tag der Inkubation in den meisten Fällen nahezu vollständig immobilisiert wurden. Nach 14 Tagen setzte in den meisten Zugabevarianten die N-Remineralisation mit einer durchschnittlichen Rate von 0. 73 µg N g- 1 Boden d- 1 ein. Damit entsprach diese ohne signifikanten Unterschied der N-Mineralisationsrate in der zugabelosen Kontrolle. Eine signifikante Netto-N-Mineralisation von organischem N erfolgte in keiner der Zugabevarianten im Vergleich mit der Kontrolle. Die Zugabe von Kompost und Filterkuchen resultierte in einem linearen Anstieg von C in mikrobieller Biomasse mit steigender Menge an zugeführtem C. Diese Zunahme wurde nicht durch die unterschiedliche Substratqualität beeinflusst, z. B. dem dreifach höheren Gehalt an K 2 SO 4 -extrahierbarem organischen C des Zuckerrohr-Filterkuchens. In den meisten Zugabevarianten nahmen C und N in der mikrobiellen Biomasse bis ans Ende der Inkubation zu. Keine Synergieeffekte konnten in den Mischungsvarianten von Kompost und Zuckerrohr-Filterkuchen beobachtet werden. Der dritte, 42 -tägige Inkubationsversuch wurde durchgeführt, um die Fragen zu beantworten, ob die Zersetzung von Zuckerrohr-Filterkuchen ebenfalls in einem salzhaltigen und alkalischen Boden zu einer Immobilisation von N führt und ob das Mischen von Zuckerrohr-Filterkuchen mit Glucose (eingestellt auf ein C/N-Verhältnis von 12. 5 mit (NH 4) 2 SO 4) die Zersetzung beeinflusst. Der relative Anteil der CO 2 -Produktion nahm von 35 % der zugegebenen C-Menge in der reinen 0. 5 % Filterkuchen-Variante über 41 % in der 0. 5 % Filterkuchen + 0. 25 % Glucose-Variante auf 48 % in der 0. 5 % Filterkuchen + 0. 5 % Glucose-Variante zu. In den drei Zugabevarianten kam es zu einer unmittelbaren Zunahme von C und N in mikrobieller Biomasse innerhalb von 6 h, die nur in der reinen Filterkuchen-Variante bis ans Ende der Inkubation anhielt. Die pilzliche Zellmembran-Komponente Ergosterol zeigte anfänglich einen überproportionalen Anstieg in Relation zum C in mikrobieller Biomasse, der vollständig bis zum Ende der Inkubation verschwand. Die Cellulase-Aktivität zeigte eine fünffache Zunahme nach Filterkuchen-Zugabe, die nicht durch eine weitere Glucosezugabe erhöht wurde. Die Cellulase-Aktivität zeigte eine exponentielle Abnahme auf ein Niveau um 4 % des Ausgangswerts in allen Varianten. Die Menge an anorganischem N, die von Tag 0 bis Tag 14 immobilisiert wurde, nahm mit zunehmender Menge an C im Vergleich mit der Kontrollvariante zu. Ab dem Tag 14 wurde das immobilisierte N mit Raten zwischen 1. 31 und 1. 51 µg N g- 1 Boden d- 1 in den Zugabevarianten remineralisiert und war damit mehr als doppelt so hoch wie in der Kontrollvariante. Das bedeutet, dass die Remineralisationsrate unabhängig von der aktuellen Größe des Pools an mikrobiellen Residuen ist und damit ebenso unabhängig von der Größe der mikrobiellen Biomasse. Andere unbekannte Bodeneigenschaften scheinen einen boden-spezifischen Regulator für die Freigabe von anorganischem N zu bilden. Der vierte Inkubationsversuch wurde mit Absicht durchgeführt, die Auswirkungen von Salzzugaben mit unterschiedlicher Anionenzusammensetzung (Cl-, SO 42 -, HCO 3 -) auf die mikrobielle Nutzung von Zuckerrohr-Filterkuchen und Dhancha-Blättern, die zu inokuliertem sterilen Quarzsand zugegeben wurden, zu untersuchen. In dem fünften Versuch war die Absicht, die Auswirkungen von Inokulum und Temperatur auf die Zersetzung von Zuckerrohr-Filterkuchen abzuschätzen. In dem vierten Experiment führte der Zuckerrohr-Filterkuchen zu signifikant niedrigeren Respirationsraten, niedrigeren Gehalten an extrahierbarem C und N, und niedrigeren Gehalten an C und N in mikrobieller Biomasse als die Dhancha-Blätter, aber zu höheren respiratorischen Quotienten RQ und zu höheren Gehalten des pilzlichen Biomarkers Ergosterol. Der RQ war signifikant größer nach Salzzugabe, wenn der Mittelwert aller Salzzugabe-Varianten mit der Kontrolle verglichen wurde. Unterschiede in der Anionenzusammensetzung hatten keine klaren Auswirkungen auf die RQ-Werte. Im fünften Experiment, erhöhte die Zunahme der Temperatur von 20 auf 40 °C die CO 2 -Produktionsrate mit einem Faktor von 1. 6, O 2 -Verbrauchs mit einem Faktor von 1. 9 und den Ergosterolgehalt um 60 %. Im Gegensatz dazu nahm der Gehalt an N in mikrobieller Biomasse um 60 % und der RQ um 13 % ab. Das Inokulum mit salzhaltigem Boden hatten in den meisten Fällen negative Auswirkungen und zeigte keine bessere Anpassung dieser Organismen an Salinität. Die generellen Auswirkungen der Anionenzusammensetzung auf die Indizes für mikrobielle Biomasse und Aktivität waren gering und inkonsistent. Nur die Fraktion des 0, 5 M K 2 SO 4 -extrahierbaren Kohlenstoffs und Stickstoffs in nicht-fumigierten Böden war beständig erhöht in der 1, 2 M NaHCO 3 -Variante von beiden Experimenten. Im Gegensatz zu den geringen Salinitäts-Effekten hatte die Substratqualität überwältigenden Auswirkungen auf die Indizes für mikrobielle Biomasse und Aktivität, insbesondere auf den pilzlichen Anteil der mikrobiellen Gemeinschaft...|$|E

Tube sights offer the option of fitted dust covers {{and the ability to}} <b>add</b> <b>filters,</b> such as polarizing or haze filters, and glare reducing sunshades. Since a reflector sight only really needs a single optical surface, the [...] "reflector", the tube is not needed. This allows for non-tubed [...] "open sights" [...] that consist of a flat base, with a single loop of material to support the reflective optics.|$|R

The app allows the user to create a new clip by tapping on a red record button, or use photos or videos in the device's photo library. Then, after a clip is recorded, it can be added to a project {{timeline}} which is {{at the bottom of the}} screen. The user can share their project on social media platforms.
