In the 1980s, the importance of class itself, as an historical social relationship and explanatory concept, began to be widely challenged. Some notable labor historians turned from Marxism to embrace a postmodernist approach, emphasizing the importance of language and questioning whether classes could be so considered if they did not use a [...] "language of class". Other historians emphasized the weaknesses and moderation of the historic labor movement, arguing that social development had been characterized more by <b>accommodation,</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the social order and cross-class collaboration than by conflict and dramatic change.|$|E

At this stage, the individual accepts the group’s norms, values, and perspectives (assimilation), and the group adapts to fit the new member’s needs (<b>accommodation).</b> The <b>acceptance</b> transition point is then reached and the individual becomes a full member. However, this transition can be delayed if the individual or the group reacts negatively. For example, the individual may react cautiously or misinterpret other members’ reactions if {{they believe that they}} will be treated differently as a new comer.|$|R

In support of this viewpoint, I offer ethnographic accounts of my time conducting research on music and Williams Syndrome and working alongside music therapists at the Whispering Trails summer camp for children with Williams Syndrome (WS) in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Ultimately, I argue that synergistic collaboration between the fields of medical ethnomusicology and music therapy will not only augment scholarship in these areas, but will also allow ethnomusicologists and music therapists to address issues of social justice and to promote <b>accommodation</b> and <b>acceptance</b> for disability within society...|$|R
40|$|Personal forgiveness, in a worldly setting, {{is an act}} {{performed}} by a human person to overcome resentment, among others, in order for that person {{to open up to}} possibilities of <b>accommodation</b> of, <b>acceptance</b> of, and reconciliation or communion with the Other. I want to argue that such an act is spiritual in nature or has an element of divinity in it. To forgive is to be lovingly compassionate, and the act of being lovingly compassionate in the midst of being wronged or downtrodden, or exploited and so on—real or imagined—is an act that goes beyond being human: it appears knowingly or unknowingly—even for a non-believer—to have the guidance of a spiritual support. One overriding reason, among many, on why we must forgive is to have peace of mind, that is, to overcome the inherent spiritual distress or emotional burden, or both. In this regard, personal forgiveness may be considered as a form of an enlightened self-interest...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} provide an {{overview}} of how requirements and unmet needs for disability-related aids, devices and human supports changed between 2001 and 2006 using results from Statistics Canada’s Participation and Activity Limitations Surveys. It will illustrate the usefulness of applying a social/cultural model of disability in developing our understanding as to why these changes have taken place. In particular it will show strong relationships between: · Advances in the inclusion of people with disabilities and related changes in both requirements and unmet need. For example, the period saw tightening of the labour market and a commensurate shift of a significant number of non-senior adults with disabilities into employment. Paralleling this shift were increases in both the needs and unmet requirements for work-related <b>accommodations.</b> · <b>Acceptance</b> of innovations in design and technology and changes in perceptions of both requirements and unmet needs. For example, there had been marked increases in both the use and unmet need for computer-based supports for people with learning/developmental impairments. The paper will also illustrate the mitigating effects of socio-demographic changes in the population of people with disabilities on requirements and unmet needs. Thus evidence from PALS indicates that increasing access to educational opportunities has translated into significant increases in levels of educational attainment and employment levels among younger people with disabilities, which in turn have affected accommodation requirements. At the same time, there is evidence that considerable increases in age-related impairments commensurate with our graying population have resulted in significant increases in the need for <b>accommodation</b> and <b>acceptance</b> of those adapting to their impairments through their use.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the psychological impact of receiving {{a diagnosis of}} ADHD in adulthood and treatment with medica-tion and to examine how diagnosis and treatment with medication changes an individual’s self-perception and view of the future. Method: Participants were eight individuals diagnosed with ADHD at a tertiary service. Semistructured interviews were conducted and the data were analyzed according {{to the principles of}} Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results: Three master themes emerge from the analysis: Participants engage in a (a) review of the past, particularly how they feel dif-ferent from others, (b) the emotional impact of the diagnosis, and (c) consideration of the future. These themes suggest a six-stage model of psychological acceptance of a diagnosis of ADHD: (a) relief and elation, (b) confusion and emotional turmoil, (c) anger, (d) sadness and grief, (e) anxiety, and (f) <b>accommodation</b> and <b>acceptance.</b> Conclusion: The model indicates an important role for psychological treatment, which should begin at the point of diagnosis. Cognitive behavioral techniques will help clients diagnosed with ADHD in adulthood cope with the adjustment process. Adults should be taught skills to anticipate future hurdles and challenges and apply appropriate coping strategies. (J. of Att. Dis. 2008; 11 (4) 493 - 503...|$|R

60|$|He lost {{himself on}} these {{occasions}} both by a natural ease {{and by his}} early adoption and application {{of the principle of}} the imperturbable, which promised even from those days to govern his conduct well-nigh to the exclusion of every other. We were to know surely as time went on no comparable case of consistency of attitude--no other such prompt grasp by a nature essentially entire, a settled sovereign self, of the truth of what would work for it most favourably should it but succeed in never yielding the first inch of any ground. Immense every ground thus became by its covering itself from edge to edge with the defence of his serenity, which, whatever his fathomless private dealings with it, was never consentingly, I mean publicly, to suffer a grain of abatement. The artist's serenity, by this conception, was an intellectual and spiritual capital that must never brook defeat--which it so easily might incur by a single act of abdication. That was at any rate the case for the particular artist and the particular nature he felt himself, armour-proof as they became against the appeal of sacrifice. Sacrifice was fallibility, and one could only of course be consistent if one inveterately had hold of the truth. There was no safety or, otherwise, no inward serenity or even outward--though the outward came secondly--unless there was no deflection; none into the question, that is, of what might make for the serenity of others, which was their own affair and which above all seemed not urgent in comparison with the supreme artistic. It wasn't that the artist hadn't to pay, to pay for the general stupidity, perversity and perfidy, from the moment he might have to deal with these things; that was the inevitable suffering, and it was always there; but it could be more or less borne if one was systematically, or rather if one was naturally, or even, better still, preternaturally, in the right; since this meant the larger, the largest serenity. That account of so fine a case of inward confidence would indeed during those very first years have sinned somewhat by anticipation; yet something of the beauty--that is of the unmatched virtuosity--of the attitude finally achieved did even at the early time colour the air of intercourse with him for those who had either few enough or many enough of their own reserves. The second of these conditions sprang from a due anxiety for one's own interests, more or less defined in advance and therefore, as might be, more or less menaced; the other proviso easily went with vagueness--vagueness as to what things were one's interests, seeing that the exhibited working of an esthetic and a moral confidence conjoined on that scale and at play together unhampered would perhaps prove for the time an attraction beyond any other. This reflection must verily, in our relation, have brought about my own quietus--so far as that mild ecstasy could be divorced from agitation. I recall at all events less of the agitation than of the ecstasy; the primary months, certain aspects even of the few following years, look out at me as from fine <b>accommodations,</b> <b>acceptances,</b> submissions, emotions, all melted together, that one must have taken for joys of the mind and gains of the imagination so clear as to cost one practically nothing. They are what I see, and are all I want to see, as I look back; there hangs about them a charm of thrilled good faith, the flush and throb of crowding apprehensions, that has scarce faded and of which I can only wish to give the whole picture the benefit. I bottle this imponderable extract of the loitering summers of youth, when every occasion really seemed to stay to be gathered and tasted, {{just for the sake of}} its faint sweetness.|$|R
40|$|When {{faced with}} the problem of pain one can attempt a {{solution}} aimed at relief (assimilation) or a solution aimed at <b>acceptance</b> (<b>accommodation).</b> Using this dual process model of adaptation to pain, this study compares acute and chronic pain patients on their approach to problem solving. Three hundred and sixty-four patients were recruited from clinical settings, 303 with chronic pain and 61 with acute pain, and completed a range of measures of both affect and pain-related behavior, including the Pain Solutions Questionnaire. The effects of overall duration of pain were also investigated. Chronic pain patients reported greater disability and catastrophic thinking about pain than acute pain patients, and assimilative coping was associated with greater disability, greater attention to pain, and more catastrophic thinking about pain, beyond the effects of demographic variables and pain severity. Pain duration did not moderate these associations. Only in the case of catastrophic thinking about pain was it found that the effects of assimilative coping were moderated by pain duration. For chronic pain patients, catastrophic thinking about pain was greater when assimilative coping was higher. These results are discussed {{within the context of a}} goal directed motivational model of adaptation to chronic pain...|$|R

With {{the emergence of the}} neologism ‘intangible cultural heritage’ in 2003 and the adoption of the Intangible Cultural Heritage Law of the People’sRepublic of China in 2011 various popular religious practices in China which used to be considered as feudal superstitions started to be recognized as examples of cultural heritage worthy of protection. If we examine the concept of religious diversity at a local level in contemporary China, the process of a ‘patrimonialization’ of popular religious practices that reflect the dynamic relationships which can be detected across diverse discourses, multiple stakeholders and cultural policies in different arenas could offer us a new perspective on religious practices to explore. In this article I offer an analysis, based on fieldwork conducted between 2013 and 2016 on the Leizhou Peninsula in southern China’s Guangdong Province, of the varying degrees of <b>acceptance,</b> <b>accommodation</b> and resistance prompted by the actualization of popular religious practices in this era of patrimonialization...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an illustration of}} the access barriers to health care as experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Mount Isa, Queensland, Australia. This examination is conducted via fieldwork observations and the narratives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Mount Isa, {{as well as the}} stories of the health professionals that care for them. In particular, this thesis attempts to unpack the term 'cultural barriers' as used in health and medical literature in discussions of access. Stories are placed within the context of Australian rural health issues and considerations of global issues affecting rural, minority and Indigenous populations. The research represents a distinct blend of anthropology and health services research principles and practices. This perspective is developed utilising principles from the 'Mindful Bodies' approach within Critical Medical Anthropology, which seeks an understanding of human health issues via examination at three levels (or bodies) : the individual body, the social body and the body politic (Scheper-Hughes and Lock 1987). Critical issues of concern with regards to health service provision in Mount Isa are examined using Penchansky and Thomas's (1981) taxonomy, the 5 As of Access. This taxonomy allows for a nuanced discussion of access by unpacking the term and identifying the various aspects that create access: Availability, Accessibility, Affordability, <b>Accommodation</b> and <b>Acceptance.</b> Dedicated ethnographic fieldwork was undertaken in Mount Isa from October 2007 to August 2009. An examination of the ways that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Mount Isa express their understandings of the barriers to health care has two advantages. First, such discussions at a local level align with and illuminate the barriers that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations nationally. Second, the significance assigned to such barriers, and examination of what may constitute a cultural barrier (as discussed in health literature) highlights the ways in which cultural difference becomes constructed as problematic in health system encounters. Culture should not be seen as a barrier to health care, but should be seen as an opportunity for increased awareness, understanding and improved personal care for patients in the health system...|$|R
40|$|Student-university fit {{leads to}} {{increased}} satisfaction with a student’s postsecondary institution {{and has a}} positive effect on college completion (Braxton, Vesper, 2 ̆ 6 Hossler, 1995). As increasing numbers of deaf and hard-of-hearing students elect to attend college (Newman, Wagner, Cameto, Knokey, 2 ̆ 6 Shaver, 2010), the relationship between college choice and completion points to a need to better understand how students make their college decisions. Using a qualitative phenomenological design, the present study examined factors that influence deaf and hard-of-hearing students’ college choice and explored how deaf identity influences selection of a deaf-serving institution (DSI). The theoretical framework for the study was deaf identity development theory, which postulates that people who are deaf or hard of hearing have varying degrees of awareness of and identification with Deaf culture and the Deaf community (Glickman, 1993). Study participants were deaf and hard-of-hearing freshman baccalaureate students at a DSI in the United States. Data was gathered using individual interviews and a document reflection activity. Analysis of the data revealed four themes that describe the study participants’ college choice process: Secondary School Influences, Preparation for Career and Life, <b>Accommodation</b> for and <b>Acceptance</b> of Individuals who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing, and Searching for Kindred. The findings point to the importance of educational environments that can appropriately serve the needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing students. The results also point to a fundamental role in higher education for DSIs, which serve both the educational and sociocultural identity needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing students...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the ways in}} which state policies recognize, accommodate and legitimize immigrant cultures, and analyzes the extent to which state <b>accommodation</b> leads to <b>acceptance</b> and tolerance toward immigrants. The study brings together social psychological and institutionalist perspectives, and argues that state recognition and accommodation of immigrant cultures normalize new practices and traditions by making them a part of the country 2 ̆ 7 s cultural landscape. This state-led process blurs group lines, and reduces the likelihood of prejudice against immigrants. In contrast, when a state ignores or actively excludes an immigrant culture, it frames those associated with it as outsiders or lesser-citizens, and makes tolerance toward them less likely. To test that hypothesis, the study focuses on the Muslim immigrants in Western Europe, since their case involves a salient (real or perceived) cultural distance to the host societies. The study employs a mixed-methods research. It first examines the Belgian, British and German cases, and traces the process from state accommodation to tolerance with a special focus on the legitimization of cultural elements by state recognition. Then, it conducts a systematic analysis that covers nineteen countries in Western Europe. Individual-level data for the analysis come from the fourth wave of the European Values Study. On the country-level, the study builds what it calls the Accommodation of Islam (AOI) index to measure the extent to which Western European countries accommodate Islam in a variety of realms. Then, it specifies a multilevel regression model that controls for all major alternative explanations. On the individual level, the findings reveal multiple dimensions of religiosity that have divergent influences on anti-Muslim prejudice. On the country level, they indicate that the individuals in countries that do not accommodate Islam {{are more likely to be}} prejudiced against Muslims...|$|R
40|$|In {{the study}} of the {{scientific}} exchanges in India, Nityānanda’s works have been largely unknown and unexamined by modern scholars. As an astronomer at the Mughal court of Emperor Shāh Jahān through the early parts of the seventeenth century, Nityānanda was commissioned by his patron, Shāh Jahān’s minister Āsaf Khān, to translate an Indo-Persian zīj, a set of astronomical, geographical and mathematical tables into Sanskrit. In the early 1630 s, he presented the enormous translated compilation of these tables called Siddhāntasindhu; however, the use of Islamic parameters in the computation of these tables appears not to have been favourably received within the traditional Sanskrit scholarly community. In the years that followed, Nityānanda restructured Islamic concepts of astronomy into the more canonical format of a Sanskrit siddhānta ‘treatise in astronomy’ complete with separate chapters on computations, spheres, and instruments. He presented his work, The Sarvasiddhāntarāja ‘King of all Siddhāntas’, in 1639 CE. It is amongst the earliest known siddhāntic texts to explicitly include elements of Græco-Islamic astronomy within traditional jyotiṣa astronomy. This thesis includes a critical edition of the ‘chapter on spheres’ (golādhyāya) of Nityānanda’s Sarvasiddhāntarāja, along with an English translation and commentary of the hundred and thirty-five verses that comprise the chapter. A technical and detailed analysis of these verses is attempted here in an effort to understand and comment on their contents. The introductory and concluding discussions of this thesis are included to provide the context to Nityānanda’s work in {{the study of}} the history of Indian astronomy. The study of the history of scientific exchanges between cultures is a dynamic enterprise due to the vibrancy and the mystery of the ‘intellectual commerce’ that occurred between them. The <b>acceptance,</b> <b>accommodation,</b> adaptation, innovation, or even rejection of ideas seen in the scholarly works of a period help us constantly reform our own understanding of the conceptual transactions within those cultures of scientific enquiry. In an attempt to address these themes in the context of Islamic and siddhāntic astronomy of seventeenth century India, I look at Nityānanda’s golādhyāya containing the geometrical discussions on the different spheres conceptualised in the study of astronomy...|$|R
40|$|In the United States {{during the}} 1920 s and 1930 s a loose-knit group of activists {{promoting}} {{what they called}} good music encountered the rise of commercial radio. Recognizing a tremendous resource, they sought to enlist radio in their cause, {{and in many ways}} were successful. However, commercial radio also transformed the activists, subverting an important part of their vision of a musical America: widespread preference for good music in the public at large. Instead, good music became the premium product line of commercial radio and the activists became more nearly realistic about their role in society. Charles Seeger offered a scholarly history of this effort in his 1957 paper, "Music and Class Structure in the United States. " This dissertation uses the model of cultural formation from Seeger's essay as a guide to the transformation of those he calls "'make-America-musical' missionaries," between 1918 and 1935. In addition this study uses theories on community presented by Thomas Bender in Community and Social Change in America, and theories on democracy presented by Robert H. Wiebe in Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy, to further illuminate Seeger's model. Views expressed by representatives of the National Federation of Music Clubs, described by Karen J. Blair as "the largest and most influential organization uniting women's musical societies," and by conductor Walter Damrosch, who served on the NBC Advisory Panel, occupy central places in this study, as does the publication Musical America, an omnibus music periodical founded in 1898 by British émigré John C. Freund for the stated purpose of "development of music in America. " Reports in Musical America, together with proceedings of the federation and of Music Teachers National Conference, and a series of books published {{under the auspices of the}} federation from 1924 - 29 to train music club members, function as core sources. These reveal the transformation of these activists from their expansive speculation in the years following the Great War, through a period of resistance to trends in the larger culture that peaks in the middle of the 1920 s, to their <b>accommodation</b> and enthusiastic <b>acceptance</b> of commercial radio as a home for good music...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This work investigates {{practical}} {{realities of}} international socio-cultural inclusivity from a linguistic {{point of view}} in a context of International Higher Education. It speculates that linguistic inclusivity in International Higher Education appears to be merely rhetoric {{when it comes to the}} adaptation to and accommodation of Non-Native varieties of the English language on the basis of intelligibility. The need to consider this rhetoric as against what obtains in reality was strengthened by a conflicting tension observable in the literature and by certain Higher Education practices in countries categorised as Native Speaking (NS). The tension has to do with the conflict in global English discourse between the Standard English (SE) camp and the World English (WE) one. While scholars of the former advocate for sustaining the Native Speaking (NS) varieties as the ‘standard’ in the international use of the English language, scholars of the latter state that Non-Native (NNS) varieties could also be standardised in their own rights. International Higher Education appears to be favouring the SE side of the divide over WE, as can be seen for example on the dependence on NS-based testing systems through IELTS and TOEFL or their equivalents for recruitment and selection of both international students and international staff. This work starts from the premise that true ‘internationalisation’, socio-cultural inclusivity and integration is meant to be void of any superiority views or practices that favour one socio-cultural group over another, even linguistically. With this in mind, the project set out to investigate perceptions on linguistic inclusivity in International Higher Education, albeit with recognisable limitations on generalisabilty of the results of the findings, because this study is considered as the beginning of a more wide-reaching research gap area. In order to achieve the stated purpose above, data was gathered from students-as-stakeholders and managers-as-stakeholders on their orientation towards international NNS scholars and academics who possess country-specific varieties of English which are clearly different from those of the NS. A two-sided innovative approach aimed at testing for intelligibility, as well as gathering perception on and seeking orientations of NNS/WE speakers was employed. It involved the use of an IELTS listening test, where the recorded speakers were NNS/WE users, and a post-test perceptions questionnaire, administered to the student participants. There was also the use of focus group discussions aimed at spurring more in-depth and insightful orientations towards NNS varieties from the students. The orientation of the management participants, which had more to do with how NNS/WE varieties of English influence their recruitment and selection decisions, were collated through interviews. The findings showed that although both stakeholder groups identify with the need for, and importance of socio-cultural integration, their linguistic orientations towards NNS/WE varieties of English, were negative and influenced by subjective judgements that favour the upholding of SE or NS based standards and competences over WE or NNS ones. The findings also particularly showed that even when NNS/WE speakers are intelligible, the varieties of English they possess is not considered worthy of acceptance for academic, scholarly or teaching roles in the supposedly ‘international’ or ‘internationalising’ Higher Education environments. It was therefore concluded that there appears to be contradictions in the equal opportunities and diversity claims within the two International Higher Education institutions surveyed when it comes to linguistic communicative realities involving the use of the English language as a lingua franca. This is because, while the rhetoric projects the propagation of inclusivity and integration, the reality with major stakeholders appears to still be in sharp contrast with the overall meaning of international <b>accommodation,</b> adaptation and <b>acceptance,</b> particularly as it concerns linguistic differences that are peculiar to Non-Native users of the English Language. ...|$|R
