5|$|Despite its {{relative}} brightness (it is <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> {{as bright as}} Pluto), Makemake was not discovered until after many much fainter Kuiper belt objects. Most searches for minor planets are conducted relatively close to the ecliptic (the region of the sky that the Sun, Moon and planets appear to lie in, as seen from Earth), due to the greater likelihood of finding objects there. It probably escaped detection during the earlier surveys due to {{its relative}}ly high orbital inclination, {{and the fact that}} it was at its farthest distance from the ecliptic at the time of its discovery, in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices.|$|E

5|$|Overall, Europeans formed {{only about}} {{a tenth of the}} royalist armies in Spanish America, and only about half of the expeditionary units, once they were {{deployed}} in the Americas. Since each European soldier casualty was replaced by a Spanish American soldier, over time, there were more and more Spanish American soldiers in the expeditionary units. For example, Pablo Morillo, {{commander in chief of the}} expeditionary force sent to South America, reported that he had only 2,000 European soldiers under his command in 1820; in other words, only half the soldiers of his expeditionary force were European. It is estimated that in the Battle of Maipú only a quarter of the royalist forces were European soldiers, in the Battle of Carabobo <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>fifth,</b> and in the Battle of Ayacucho less than 1% was European.|$|E
5|$|The two dorsal fins are {{of nearly}} equal size and placed far {{back on the}} body, with the first {{originating}} over the latter third of the pelvic fin bases and the second over {{the latter half of}} the anal fin base. The pectoral and pelvic fins are broad and rounded; the males have stout claspers. The pelvic and anal fins are about as large as the dorsal fins. The broad caudal fin comprises <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> of the total body length and has a strong notch near the tip of the upper lobe and an indistinct lower lobe. The skin is thick and covered by well-calcified arrowhead-shaped dermal denticles. The coloration of the dark shyshark is highly variable, and particular individuals can resemble any of the other shyshark species. The background color ranges from light brown to reddish to grayish to almost black above, transitioning abruptly to white or cream below, sometimes with dark blotches beneath the paired fins. There may be 68 orange, brown, or blackish variably shaped saddles along the back and tail, edged more or less obviously in black. There may also be white spots within or within and between the saddles.|$|E

5|$|Livermorium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Lv and atomic number 116. It {{is an extremely}} radioactive element that has only been created in the laboratory {{and has not been}} observed in nature. The element is named after the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States, which collaborated with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia to discover livermorium during experiments made between 2000 and 2006. The name of the laboratory refers to the city of Livermore, California where it is located, which in turn was named after the rancher and landowner Robert Livermore. The name was adopted by IUPAC on May 30, 2012. Four isotopes of livermorium are known, with mass numbers between 290 and 293 inclusive; the longest-lived among them is livermorium-293 with <b>a</b> half-life of <b>about</b> 60milliseconds. <b>A</b> <b>fifth</b> isotope with mass number 294 has been reported but not yet confirmed.|$|R

In reality, even though the harpedonaptae (“rope stretchers”) who were the surveyor’s assistants were not individually known, the master surveyors were not only well known but each even had his own tomb adorned with wall paintings and hieroglyphics of a biographical nature attesting to their achievements and status during their lives {{in the service of the}} King. Ironically, the five well testified Royal Surveyors, or Scribes of the Fields, as they were officially titled, are all from the Eighteenth Dynasty of the New Kingdom (around 1400 B. C.).

40|$|The nearby dwarf {{irregular}} galaxies the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds have metallicities of <b>about</b> {{half and}} <b>a</b> <b>fifth</b> solar, respectively, which offers the {{unique opportunity to}} study astrophysical processes {{as a function of}} metallicity.

I will review past surveys for circumstellar OH, water, and SiO masers in the Magellanic Clouds (and provide a literature review of interstellar masers).
