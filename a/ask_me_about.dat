25|$|I {{know that}} some people are getting very {{defensive}} about Black Swan and my role in it, but back-stabbing is not my purpose when people <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the legitimacy of the dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. The truth is that no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.|$|E

[...] In a 7 November 2014 interview with SiriusXM's Town Hall series, Page confirmed again that he did not play on the song, saying [...] "Oh, Crikey! I wasn't on 'You Really Got Me,' but I did play on the Kinks' records. That's all I'm going to say about it. But every time I do an interview, people <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> 'You Really Got Me.' So maybe somebody can correct Wikipedia so people won't keep asking me." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} sportscasters, writers and journalists point to Tunis' books as {{inspiration}} for their careers. Tunis is mentioned by author Daniel Okrent in the dedication for The Ultimate Baseball Book {{as one of}} [...] "those responsible for the earliest roots of this project". Writer and editor Tad Richards says, [...] "I remember telling my mother... 'When I {{grow up to be}} a writer, and people <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the greatest influence on my writing career, I'm going to say John R. Tunis. Among Tunis' many childhood fans are sports writer and children's author Thomas J. Dygard, Pulitzer Prize finalist Lee Martin, journalist Charles Kuralt [...] and football legend Johnny Unitas. New York Post columnist and editor Pete Hamill picked The Kid From Tomkinsville as one of his five favorite sports novels, writing that [...] "virtually every sportswriter I know remembers reading it as a boy." [...] In Partial Payment: Essays on Writers and Their Lives, literary critic Joseph Epstein devotes one chapter, [...] "A Boy's Own Author", to Tunis. Epstein admits that re-reading many childhood favorites can be disappointing, but found upon revisiting Tunis that his books are [...] "pretty serious, and I was utterly absorbed in them".|$|E

500|$|... "Cop Killer" [...] was {{replaced}} by a new version of [...] "Freedom of Speech," [...] a song from Ice-T's 1989 solo album The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say. The song was re-edited and remixed to give it a more rock-oriented sound, using a looped sample from the Jimi Hendrix song [...] "Foxy Lady." [...] Alongside the album's reissue, Warner Bros. issued [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as a single. Ice-T left Warner Bros. Records the following year because of disputes over his solo album Home Invasion, taking Body Count with him. The studio version of [...] "Cop Killer" [...] has not been re-released, although a live version of the song appears on Body Count's 2005 release Live in L.A. According to Ernie C, the controversy over the song [...] "still lingers for us, even now. I'll try to book clubs and the guy I'm talking to will mention it and I'll think to myself 'Man, that was 17 years ago.' But I meet a lot of bands who <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it, too, and I'm real respected by other artists for it. But it's a love/hate thing.

2500|$|On {{his days}} in big band/swing music: [...] "It's really so long ago, one {{ought to be able}} to invoke a statute of limitations. I played with Benny Goodman for two years, and I've been {{composing}} for 40. At the time, swing music, big-band music and Benny Goodman in particular were so boundlessly popular that people who made room for it in their lives have never forgotten it. So I get calls from people who are in a kind of time warp, who <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> this period of my life as though it were the present. But I've moved on to other things." ...|$|E

2500|$|Both Johnny Marr and Morrissey have {{repeatedly}} {{said that they}} will not reunite the band. In 2006, Morrissey declared, [...] "I would rather eat my own testicles than reform the Smiths, and that's saying something for a vegetarian." [...] When asked why in another interview the same year, he responded, [...] "I feel as if I've worked very hard since the demise of the Smiths and the others haven't, so why hand them attention that they haven't earned? We are not friends, we don't see each other. Why on earth would we be on a stage together?" [...] In a February 2009 interview on BBC Radio 2, he said, [...] "People always <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> reunions and I can't imagine why... the past seems like a distant place, and I'm pleased with that." ...|$|E

You win a Super Bowl, you have a big achievement, and you write a book. And I didn't want {{to be one of those}} guys, but a lot of people thought that it was the right time -- and it did turn out to be that. I think people were looking for something positive to read, and we had a lot of negative in the sports world. I think it just came out at the right time. Maybe the Lord's timing was good." ...|$|E

The conversation got a little heated and I explained they couldn't do it under the name SABBAT as both he and (bassist) Frazer quit, leaving me and (drummer) Simon (Negus) with a lot of debts and financial problems to clear up. This was the reason we carried on as SABBAT and did a third album. Obviously we wanted the new line up to work out but it didn't … simple as that. What it came down to though was Simon Negus and myself, in theory, own the business and name as they left. If you left your employee, you couldn't go and start that business somewhere else under the same name." ...|$|E

2500|$|Piper starred as Hannah Baxter in Secret Diary of a Call Girl, an ITV2 {{adaptation}} of Brooke Magnanti's The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl, a memoir detailing {{the life of}} a high-class prostitute who adopted [...] "Belle de Jour" [...] as her pseudonym, which aired from September 2007. As part of her preparation for the role, Piper met the memoir's author two years before her identity as a research scientist was revealed in a Sunday newspaper: [...] "I absolutely had to meet the person behind the words {{to be able to take}} the part... people did <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> her and I just had to smile, to avoid giving anything away." [...] A second season, with Piper again in the starring role, started filming in May 2008, during which two body doubles were hired to hide Piper's pregnancy during the sex scenes. The third season began airing in January 2010. For the third and fourth series Piper was credited as executive producer.|$|E
2500|$|Narrated Anas ibn Malik: [...] "I know (about) the Hijab (the {{order of}} veiling of women) {{more than anybody}} else. Ubay ibn Ka'b used to <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it.

Allah's Apostle {{remained}} sitting and some people remained sitting with him after the other guests had left. Then Allah's Apostle {{got up and went}} away, and I too, followed him till he reached the door of 'Aisha's room. Then he thought that the people must have left the place by then, so he returned and I also returned with him. Behold, the people were still sitting at their places. So he went back again for the second time, and I went along with him too. When we reached the door of 'Aisha's room, he returned and I also returned with him to see that the people had left. Thereupon the Prophet hung a curtain between me and him and the Verse regarding the order for (veiling of women) Hijab was revealed." [...] , ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell's {{opposition to the}} nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, [...] "Every good Christian should be concerned", Goldwater retorted: [...] "Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass." [...] (According to John Dean, Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the [...] "nuts", but the news media [...] "changed the anatomical reference.") Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the Iran–Contra Affair became public in 1986. Journalist Robert MacNeil, a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward. [...] "He {{was sitting in his}} office with his hands on his cane... and he said to me, 'Well, aren't you going to <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the Iran arms sales?' It had just been announced that the Reagan administration had sold arms to Iran. And I said, 'Well, if I asked you, what would you say?' He said, 'I'd say it's the god-damned stupidest foreign policy blunder this country's ever made!'", though aside from the Iran–Contra scandal, Goldwater thought nonetheless that Reagan was a good president. In 1988 during that year's [...] presidential campaign, he pointedly told vice-presidential nominee Dan Quayle at a campaign event in Arizona [...] "I want you to go back and tell George Bush to start talking about the issues." ...|$|E
