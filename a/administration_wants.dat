He then meets with Senator Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson) and suggests that she ought to consider seeking the nomination for Secretary of State. He also privately confronts Congressman Russo about his arrest and checkered history of substance abuse and soliciting prostitutes, and demands Russo’s loyalty in exchange for making the incident disappear.|$|E

2500|$|On January 31, 2006, Kaine {{gave the}} Democratic {{response}} to President George W. Bush's 2006 State of the Union address. In it, Kaine criticized the Bush administration's No Child Left Behind Act for [...] "wreaking havoc on local school districts"; criticized congressional Republicans for cutting student loan programs; and condemned as [...] "reckless" [...] Bush's spending increases and tax cuts. Kaine praised bipartisan initiatives in Virginia [...] "to make record investments in education" [...] {{and to improve}} veterans' access to veterans' benefits. Kaine criticized the Bush administration's conduct of the Iraq War and treatment of U.S. soldiers; saying that [...] "the American people were given inaccurate information about reasons for invading Iraq"; [...] "our troops in Iraq were not given the best body armor or the best intelligence"; and [...] "the <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> to further reduce military and veterans' benefits." ...|$|E
50|$|When the {{lighthouse}} was being {{planned for the}} area, there were conflicting views on its location. Gustaf Brodd, then head of the Finnish pilot and lighthouse <b>administration,</b> <b>wanted</b> {{the lighthouse}} to be built on Glosholm, but {{the head of the}} Russian Lighthouse <b>Administration</b> <b>wanted</b> a more southerly location on Söderskär. In 1826, Tsar Nicholas I ordered the lighthouse to be built on Glosholm.|$|R

2500|$|Kennedy {{has been}} active off the bench as well, calling for reform of overcrowded American prisons in a speech before the American Bar Association. He spends his summers in Salzburg, Austria, where he teaches {{international}} and American law at the University of Salzburg for the McGeorge School of Law international program and often attends the large yearly international judges conference held there. Defending his use of international law, in 2005 Kennedy told The New Yorker staff writer Jeffrey Toobin, [...] "Why should world opinion care that the American <b>Administration</b> <b>wants</b> to bring freedom to oppressed peoples? Is that not because there's some underlying common mutual interest, some underlying common shared idea, some underlying common shared aspiration, underlying unified concept of what human dignity means? I think that's what we're trying to tell {{the rest of the}} world, anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{size of the}} American {{military}} presence after 2014 will help determine {{the size of the}} American civilian footprint. As of December 2012 the United States are reducing its plans for large civilian force in post-2014 Afghanistan, because the U.S. military is certain to curtail or stop the security and other services it provides U.S. government civilians in Afghanistan. Firm decisions on civilian numbers and locations cannot be made [...] "until we resolve exactly what the military follow-on numbers are going to be," [...] one unnamed U.S. official said. [...] "That will determine [...] . . where we locate, what kind of security, medical and other support {{we might be able to}} get." [...] According to the New York Times the U.S. military wants to retain 9,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, while the Obama <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> a force of 3,000 to 9,000 troops in Afghanistan after 2014.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 June 2014, Robert Blackwill, {{the former}} Coordinator for Strategic Planning and Deputy US National Security Advisor during the {{presidency}} of George W. Bush, spoke at length about India-US relations and said : [...] "Mr Modi is a determined leader. He is candid and frank. I also worked with him during the Gujarat earthquake when I was posted as (the US) ambassador to India. (...) It was mistake by the current Obama administration to delay engagement with Mr Modi. I {{do not know why}} they did so but definitely, this did not help in building relationship. (...) The old formula and stereotypes will not work if the US <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> to engage with Mr Modi. The Indian prime minister is candid, direct and smart. He speaks his mind. The US administration also has to engage in candid conversation when Mr Modi meets President Obama later this year. They have to do something innovative to engage with him." ...|$|E
25|$|Although in theory, Frondizi's <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to avoid}} state intervention, and {{encourage}} a progressive social policy, {{it failed to}} democratize trade unions, most of whose leadership and systems were inherited from Perón's system.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the chaos}} {{following}} the Bruno hit, DelGiorno sided with Philip Testa (aka [...] "The Chicken Man"), his consigliere Nicodemo Scarfo, and underboss Peter Casella.

60|$|And here it may {{be worth}} inquiring what are the true {{characteristics}} of a faction, or how {{it is to be}} distinguished from that great body {{of the people who are}} friends to the constitution? The heads of a faction, are usually a set of upstarts, or men ruined in their fortunes, whom some great change in a government, did at first, out of their obscurity produce upon the stage. They associate themselves with those who dislike the old establishment, religious and civil. They are full of new schemes in politics and divinity; they have an incurable hatred against the old nobility, and strengthen their party by dependants raised from the lowest of the people; they have several ways of working themselves into power; but they are sure to be called when a corrupt <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> to be supported, against those who are endeavouring at a reformation; and they firmly observe that celebrated maxim of preserving power by the same arts it is attained. They act with the spirit of those who believe their time is but short; and their first care is to heap up immense riches at the public expense; in which they have two ends, beside that common one of insatiable avarice; which are, to make themselves necessary, and to keep the Commonwealth in dependence: Thus they hope to compass their design, which is, instead of fitting their principles to the constitution, to alter and adjust the constitution to their own pernicious principles.|$|E

He nevertheless remained and managed to complete his theological studies.|$|R
50|$|The {{model was}} named after {{the conduct of the}} America's {{continuing}} conflict in Yemen. America needed to minimize the ability of the powerful Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group to attack the American homeland, while at the same time, the Obama <b>Administration</b> <b>wanted</b> to commit as few resources to the fight as possible.|$|R
50|$|Building {{from the}} 1988 cease fire agreement, the Bush <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> to {{complete}} a negotiated settlement to end the fighting between Contras and Sandinistas.

5000|$|Bush's {{policy is}} {{comparable}} {{with that of}} the Third Reich.

50|$|When the British {{returned}} {{after the end}} of World War II, they declined to recognise Sultan Ali Shah.

50|$|However, {{the same}} {{scenario}} occurred in 2012. The Al-Arabi <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> to naturalize him {{so they could}} have an extra foreign player in their squad {{to participate in the}} AFC Champions League. Despite reports of Pisculichi's ineligibility being readily available, they continued with the naturalization process. He did not gain Qatari citizenship and the club's management were criticized by local media.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{dismissal}} of each individual U.S. Attorney were unclear. Two suggested motivations were that the <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to make room for}} U.S. Attorneys who would be more sympathetic to the administration's political agenda, and the <b>administration</b> <b>wanted</b> to advance the careers of promising conservatives.Critics said that the attorneys were fired for failing to prosecute Democratic politicians, for failing to prosecute claims of election fraud that would hamper Democratic voter registration, as retribution for prosecuting Republican politicians, or for failing to pursue adult obscenity prosecutions.The administration and its supporters said that the attorneys were dismissed for job-performance reasons [...] "related to policy, priorities and management", and that U.S. Attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President. However, at least six attorneys had recently received positive evaluations of their performance from the Department of Justice. In September 2008, the Department of Justice Inspector General's investigation concluded that the dismissals were politically motivated and improper.|$|R

5000|$|In early 2012, as the Obama {{administration}} {{prepared to}} try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed at Guantanamo Bay detention camp, Waxman said on NPR it would [...] "be a big year for military commissions. ...

5000|$|That is the {{consistent}} theme of reports in The New York Times {{in a piece}} by Seymour Hersh, and in a series by Murray Waas and Douglas Frantz in The Los Angeles Times ....

5000|$|Perry {{criticized the}} Obama administration's {{announcement}} on December 6, 2011, that the United States would initiate {{the use of}} foreign aid for promoting homosexual rights across the world. Perry spoke out against the measure, saying, [...] "Just when you thought Barack Obama couldn't get any more {{out of touch with}} America’s values, AP reports his <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> to make foreign aid decisions based on gay rights.

5000|$|On July 9, 2006 The Jurist {{reported}} that DOD spokesmen {{have claimed that}} the dead men received assistance from others.

[...] However, another official stated that ending the program was not a major concession due to Assad's recent victories in the Syrian Civil War, but rather [...] "a signal to Putin that the <b>administration</b> <b>wants</b> to improve ties to Russia." [...] Some members of the Obama administration reportedly had wished to scrap the program because some rebels armed and trained by the program had joined ISIL and related groups.|$|E
50|$|After the war, the RLEA {{played a}} role in {{implementation}} of the Marshall Plan.
