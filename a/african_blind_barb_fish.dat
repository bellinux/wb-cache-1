50|$|Caecobarbus geertsi, the <b>African</b> <b>blind</b> <b>barb</b> or Congo <b>blind</b> <b>barb</b> (known as Nzonzi a mpofo in {{the local}} Kikongo language, meaning <b>blind</b> <b>barb),</b> is a ray-finned fish species in the family Cyprinidae. This {{threatened}} cavefish is only known from Democratic Republic of the Congo, {{and it is the}} only member of the monotypic genus Caecobarbus. It was George Albert Boulenger who described this fish in 1921 and it completely lacks close relatives in the Congo region.|$|R
50|$|Formerly {{known as}} a resort town, {{it is home to}} the Thysville Caves, which {{encompass}} the entire range of the colourless <b>African</b> <b>blind</b> <b>barb.</b> It is home to a major FARDC garrison: the 1st Armoured Brigade was based here during the early '90s period. The 1st Armoured Brigade was first listed in the IISS Military Balance in 1982-83 edition, implying that the brigade may have been created during that period. The city's other main industry is railway engineering.|$|R
50|$|His main {{discovery}} in 1921 {{was a strange}} fish from the Congo. It was eyeless and lacked pigmentation. He recognized it as new and unrelated to any extant epigean (eyed, surface) species of Africa. He wrote a brief paper describing this new species of cave fish, the first ever described from Africa. He called it Caecobarbus geertsii, from caeco = <b>blind,</b> barbus = <b>barb,</b> and geertsii, honoring a mysterious person, M. Geerts, who provided him with the specimen. Today, it {{is known as the}} Congo or <b>African</b> <b>blind</b> <b>barb.</b>|$|R

40|$|Electric shock {{treatment}} of Java <b>Barb</b> <b>Fish</b> (Puntius javanicus) sperm using electroporation method on sperm as transfer gen (Sperm Mediated Gen Transfer) {{has not been}} implemented in Indonesia. This {{study was conducted to}} know the effect of electric shock using gene pulser at different voltage level toward motility and viability of Java <b>barb</b> <b>fish</b> sperm. This research was conducted at Fish Breeding Laboratory, Faculty of Marine and Fisheries and LSIH of Brawijaya University-Malang in May 2017. The trial design used Complete Randomized Design with 3 different treatments and 1 control which each treatment repeated 3 times. The treatments used the Gene pulser with 3 different voltages: A (20 V), B (30 V), C (40 V). The result showed that the electric {{shock treatment}} with different voltages level affected motility and viability of Java <b>barb</b> <b>fish</b> sperm. Based on the data analysis used polynomial orthogonal, a linear-form of the relationship among the treatments in the form of equation was found (Puntius javanicus) with R 2 = 0. 9815 and equation y = - 40. 5 x + 130. 83 with R 2 = 0. 8626.

50|$|The Congo <b>blind</b> <b>barb</b> mainly {{relies on}} food items that {{flow into the}} cave during the rainy (flood) season, {{but it may also}} feed on small crustaceans. The {{longevity}} is estimated to be 9-14 years, but it may be able to live longer. It is slow-growing and likely has a slow reproduction rate. The adhesive eggs are spawned freely, ending up in crevices and pores in the bottom, which protects them from predation.|$|R

50|$|Typhlogarra widdowsoni, the Iraq <b>blind</b> <b>barb</b> or Haditha cave garra, is {{a species}} of cyprinid fish endemic to {{underground}} water systems near Haditha in Iraq. It is the only species in its genus. This cavefish is considered critically endangered because of water extraction, which has lowered the groundwater level. Once abundant, a survey in 2012 found that it now was very rare. Another species from the same place, Caecocypris basimi, may already be extinct. The only other known cavefish in Iraq is Eidinemacheilus proudlovei.|$|R
25|$|The Late Period, {{dated to}} about 2500 BC, the pithouse (quiggly hole) came into existence, {{such as those}} at the Keatley Creek Archaeological Site. Other markers of this period include the {{increasing}} number of pithouses and settlements. Fishing continued to increase, and technology advanced, introducing more specialized <b>barb</b> <b>fish</b> spears and composite toggling harpoons. Other technology was used as well, including nets and weirs. Trade networks also flourished during this time, using sea shells, turquoise, fish grease and others.|$|R
50|$|Like other cavefish, the Congo <b>blind</b> <b>barb</b> {{has reduced}} {{pigmentation}} and no externally visible eyes. Because {{of the lack}} of pigment, it appears pale whitish-pink overall. The operculum and lateral line region are purplish-red due to the gills and lateral line veins, respectively. The eye completely lacks a lens, and the retina and optical nerve are rudimentary and located deep inside the head. Despite this it is photophobic, actively avoiding light. Its maximum length is 12 cm. Minor differences have been described between the differrent cave populations; some have a spot on the opercular and one has a serrated dorsal fin spine.|$|R
50|$|The Congo <b>blind</b> <b>barb</b> {{is found}} only in the Thysville Cave system, {{a part of the}} lower Congo River basin (notably Kwilu and Inkisi tributaries) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The area where found covers about 120 km2, and is located at an {{altitude}} of about 700-850 m above sea level. It was initially known from seven caves in the Thysville system and an additional seven were discovered in the 2000s (decade). The caves where found have high levels of calcium bicarbonate in the water and high variations in flood levels, meaning that animals such as terrestrial cave insects are absent.|$|R

40|$|Aim: The main {{objective}} of this work {{is to increase the}} utilization of by-products like mucus and skin from Tinfoil <b>barb</b> <b>fish</b> in order to isolate antibacterial protein against gram positive and gram negative microorganism. Materials and Methods: The fish epidermis and epidermal mucus samples were extracted with crude, ethanol and dichloromethane to identify potential antimicrobial agents including the ethanol and dichloromethane soluble compounds. Preliminary screening for antimicrobial activity of the extracts were tested against two Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus (MTCC 1306) and Staphylococcus aureus(MTCC 3160) and two Gram-negative bacteria Shigellaboydii and E. coli(MTCC 1303) using standardized disc susceptibility test method recommended by the British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy(BSAC). The activity was measured in terms of zone of inhibition in mm. Also Mouse fibroblast 3 T 3 L 1 cell lines were used to measure cytotoxic activity. Minimum cell viability was shown by sample of 10 mg/ml concentration of the epidermal mucus. Result: The ethanol extract exhibited a bactericidal activity and inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigellaboydii and E. coli. The dichloromethane exhibited activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and no activity against Shigellaboydii. The aqueous showed no bactericidal activity for any of the human pathogen tested. These results show the presence of antimicrobial agent and the role of fish byproducts like mucus and epidermis in antimicrobial protection.

50|$|In {{the seven}} caves where first discovered, the total {{population}} has been estimated at perhaps 7,000 individuals in the 1950s; there are no estimates for the seven more recently discovered populations. Among the first seven, one has disappeared entirely following quarrying of limestone {{that began in the}} 1930s. The caves where it lives are considered sacred by the locals and this restricts access to most of them. A local law passed in 1937 limits fishing and the species has been listed on CITES since 1981, which limits international trade. Before its listing on CITES Appendix II, the species was often caught and exported for the freshwater aquarium trade, but few exports have happened after. Currently the main threat is habitat loss: The human population in its range is increasing and farming near the caves can result in sedimentation and pollution. The region was formerly covered in rainforest and grassland, which limited erosion. Other potentially serious threats are changes to the hydrology (for example, large-scale water extraction) of the small rivers that feed the caves and predation by Clarias catfish that are found in at least some places inhabited by the Congo <b>blind</b> <b>barb.</b>|$|R

40|$|The 16 African large <b>barb</b> <b>fish</b> {{species of}} Lake Tana inhabit {{different}} ecological niches, exploit different food webs and have different {{temporal and spatial}} spawning patterns within the lake. This unique fish species flock {{is thought to be}} the result of adaptive radiation within the past 5 million years. Previous analyses of major histocompatibility class II B exon 2 sequences in four Lake Tana African large barb species revealed that these sequences are indeed under selection. No sharing of class II B alleles was observed among the four Lake Tana African large barb species. In this study we analysed the class II B exon 2 sequences of seven additional Lake Tana African large barb species and African large barbs from the Blue Nile and its tributaries. In addition, the presence and variability of major histocompatibility complex class I UA exon 3 sequences in six Lake Tana and Blue Nile African large barb species was analysed. Phylogenetic lineages are maintained by purifying or neutral selection on non-peptide binding regions. Class II B intron 1 and exon 2 sequences were not shared among the different Lake Tana African large barb species or with the riverine barb species. In contrast, identical class I UA exon 3 sequences were found both in the lacustrine and riverine barb species. Our analyses demonstrate complete partitioning of class II B alleles among Lake Tana African large barb species. In contrast, class I alleles remain for the large part shared among species. These different modes of evolution probably reflect the unlinked nature of major histocompatibility genes in teleost fishes...|$|R

2500|$|Many {{aboveground}} fish {{may enter}} caves on occasion, but obligate cavefish (fish that require underground habitats) are extremophiles {{with a number}} of unusual adaptations known as troglomorphism. In some species, notably the Mexican tetra, shortfin molly, Oman garra, Indoreonectes evezardi and a few catfish, both [...] "normal" [...] aboveground and cavefish forms exist. Many adaptions seen in cavefish are aimed at surviving in a habitat with little food. Living in darkness, pigmentation and eyes are useless, or an actual disadvantage because of their energy requirements, and therefore typically reduced in cavefish. Other examples of adaptations are larger fins for more energy-efficient swimming, and a loss of scales and swim bladder. The loss can be complete or only partial, for example resulting in small or incomplete (but still existing) eyes, and eyes can be present in the earliest life stages but degenerated by the adult stage. In some cases, [...] "blind" [...] cavefish may still be able to see: Juvenile Mexican tetras of the cave form are able to sense light via certain cells in the pineal gland (pineal eye), and Congo <b>blind</b> <b>barbs</b> are photophobic, despite only having retinas and optical nerves that are rudimentary and located deep inside the head, and completely lacking a lens. In the most extreme cases, the lack of light has changed the circadian rhythm (24-hour internal body clock) of the cavefish. In the Mexican tetra of the cave form and in Phreatichthys andruzzii the circadian rhythm lasts 30 hours and 47 hours, respectively. This may help them to save energy. Without sight, other senses are used and these may be enhanced. Examples include the lateral line for sensing vibrations, mouth suction to sense nearby obstacles (comparable to echolocation), and chemoreception (via smell and taste buds). Although there are cavefish in groups known to have electroreception (catfish and South American knifefish), there is no published evidence that this is enhanced in the cave-dwellers. The level of specialized adaptations in a cavefish is generally considered to be directly correlated to the amount of time it has been restricted to the underground habitat, with species that recently arrived showing few adaptations and species with the largest number of adaptations likely being the ones restricted to the habitat for the longest time.|$|R
