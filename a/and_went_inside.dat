500|$|According to Nicholson, [...] "we {{never did}} shoot {{the end of}} the scene. This movie was pre-lit. You'd go in, plug in the lights, roll the camera, and shoot. We did the take outside the office <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> the office, plugged in, lit and rolled. Jonathan Haze was up on my chest pulling my teeth out. And in the take, he leaned back and hit the rented dental {{machinery}} {{with the back of his}} leg and it started to tip over. Roger didn't even call cut. He leapt onto the set, grabbed the tilting machine, and said 'Next set, that's a wrap.'" [...] By 9am of the first day, Corman was informed by the production manager that he was behind schedule.|$|E
2500|$|Two police officers, PC Nigel Dawson and PC Neil Blakey, who {{had arrived}} shortly after the {{ambulance}} in a marked patrol car, {{made no attempt to}} speak to Alder. They consulted with the club's manager, who took them inside to review the club's CCTV footage of the incident. A message they sent to their control room at this time indicates that they had already assumed Alder was very drunk, despite not having spoken to him or having been told this by any of the witnesses they spoke with. A third police officer, Acting Police Sergeant (A/PS) Mark Ellerington, arrived at about 2.50am, after the ambulance left, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> to speak with the club manager and the officers already present. He was told by Dawson and Blakey that Alder was drunk. The IPCC report later criticised the stance the police took, saying: [...] "This judgement, based upon very little evidence, tends to suggest that the two officers were making assumptions about Mr. Alder's behaviour, and choosing to attribute it to alcohol taken rather than the injury sustained, from an early stage in their dealings with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the French press, it {{was only}} after this {{official}} business had been completed that serious trouble began. [...] The Mayor of Tunis, Sadok Ghileb, arrived at the cemetery, and crowds pressed around him, demanding that he have the gates of the cemetery opened. [...] To reassure them, he did so <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> with a number of them. The crowd was not calmed however, and began demanding the release of those who had been arrested earlier in the morning. Ghileb then sent for Espiau, who returned to the cemetery and gave the crowd assurances about the release of those being detained. The crowd however continued to grow larger and angrier, and Espiau decided to go and bring police reinforcements. [...] He made his way with difficulty through the mass of people, and as he headed off he was struck from behind by a number of stones. A scuffle began, with the police trying to get Espiau and Ghileb safely away from the cemetery, striking protesters with their batons while the crowd threw pieces of rubble at them. Brigadier François Franchi was killed, while two police inspectors and four or five other officers were injured. The French press reported that the police fired on the crowd, but did not report numbers of dead and injured among the protesters at the cemetery. [...] Police were mustered from stations {{in other parts of the}} city but they were unable to gain control of the situation.|$|E

60|$|Both of {{the young}} hunters crawled around to the milk-house door <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>inside.</b> The board was quickly raised and they helped Mrs. Risley from the watery hole {{in which she had}} been {{squatting}} with her chin resting on her knees.

60|$|The {{president}} took his key from his pocket, opened the vault <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>inside,</b> nearly {{closing the door}} behind him. Uncle Bushrod saw, through the narrow aperture, the flicker of a candle. In a minute or two--it seemed an hour to the watcher--Mr. Robert came out, bringing with him a large hand-satchel, handling it in a careful but hurried manner, as if fearful that he might be observed. With one hand he closed and locked the vault door.|$|E

60|$|Scarcely {{daring to}} breathe, {{now that they}} knew the strange men were so close, the three Rover boys walked to the open doorway of the old mill <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>inside.</b> Dick led the way and crossed to where an {{enclosed}} stairs ran to the floor below. On tiptoes he went down, not trusting a step until {{he was sure of}} his footing. It was well he did this, for two of the steps were entirely rotted away, and he had to warn his brothers, otherwise one or another might have had a fall.|$|E
60|$|When {{he was out}} {{of sight}} of the house and the black dog, he went into the woods on the other side of the way and emerged after an {{interval}} trimming a very tolerable cudgel with his pocket-knife. Presently he saw an attractive-looking rock by the track and picked it up and put it in his pocket. Then he came to three or four houses, wooden like the last, each with an ill-painted white verandah (that was his name for it) and all standing in the same casual way upon the ground. Behind, through the woods, he saw pig-stys and a rooting black sow leading a brisk, adventurous family. A wild-looking woman with sloe-black eyes and dishevelled black hair sat upon the steps of one of the houses nursing a baby, but at the sight of Bert she got up <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>inside,</b> and he heard her bolting the door. Then a boy appeared among the pig-stys, but he would not understand Bert's hail.|$|E
60|$|But Harvey, as I {{wrote his}} {{mistress}} {{from time to}} time, throve, and when he grew better, would play by himself grisly games of spying, walking up, hailing, and chasing another dog. From these he would break off of a sudden and return to his normal stiff gait, with the air of one who had forgotten some {{matter of life and}} death, which could be reached only by staring at me. I left him one evening posturing with the unseen on the lawn, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> to finish some letters for the post. I must have been at work nearly an hour, for I was going to turn on the lights, when I felt there was somebody in the room whom, the short hairs {{at the back of my}} neck warned me, I was not in the least anxious to face. There was a mirror on the wall. As I lifted my eyes to it I saw the dog Harvey reflected near the shadow by the closed door. He had reared himself full-length on his hind legs, his head a little one side to clear a sofa between us, and he was looking at me. The face, with its knitted brows and drawn lips, was the face of a dog, but the look, for the fraction of time that I caught it, was human--wholly and horribly human. When the blood in my body went forward again he had dropped to the floor, and was merely studying me in his usual one-eyed fashion. Next day I returned him to Miss Sichliffe. I would not have kept him another day for the wealth of Asia, or even Ella Godfrey's approval.|$|E

6000|$|Thursday was {{the early}} closing day at Lammam, {{and next to}} Sunday the busiest part of the week at the Potwell Inn. Sometimes {{as many as six}} boats all at once would be moored against the ferry punt and hiring rowboats. People could either have a {{complete}} tea, a complete tea with jam, cake and eggs, a kettle of boiling water and find the rest, or refreshments á la carte, as they chose. They sat about, but usually the boiling water-ers had a delicacy about using the tables and grouped themselves humbly on the ground. The complete tea-ers with jam and eggs got the best tablecloth on the table nearest the steps that led up to the glass-panelled door. The groups about the lawn were very satisfying to Mr. Polly's sense of amenity. To the right were the complete tea-ers with everything heart could desire, then a small group of three young men in remarkable green and violet and pale-blue shirts, and two girls in mauve and yellow blouses with common teas and gooseberry jam at the green clothless table, then on the grass down by the pollard willow a small family of hot water-ers with a hamper, a little troubled by wasps in their jam from the nest in the tree and all in mourning, but happy otherwise, and on the lawn to the right a ginger beer lot of 'prentices without their collars and very jocular and happy. The young people in the rainbow shirts and blouses formed the centre of interest; they were under the leadership of a gold-spectacled senior with a fluting voice and an air of mystery; he ordered everything, and showed a peculiar knowledge of the qualities of the Potwell jams, preferring gooseberry with much insistence. Mr. Polly watched him, christened him the [...] "benifluous influence," [...] glanced at the 'prentices <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> and down into the cellar in order to replenish the stock of stone ginger beer which the plump woman had allowed to run low during the preoccupations of the campaign. It was in the cellar that he first became aware of the return of Uncle Jim. He became aware of him as a voice, a voice not only hoarse, but thick, as voices thicken under the influence of alcohol.|$|E
