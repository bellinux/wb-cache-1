5000|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>brakes</b> on {{the other}} hand use the air or vacuum {{pressure}} to hold the brakes off against a reservoir carried on each vehicle, which applies the brakes if pressure/vacuum is lost in the train pipe. <b>Automatic</b> <b>brakes</b> are thus largely [...] "fail safe", though faulty closure of hose taps can lead to accidents such as the Gare de Lyon accident.|$|R

25|$|Łukasz Urban {{was found}} dead in the {{passenger}} seat of the truck cab; he had been stabbed and shot once {{in the head with a}} small-caliber firearm. Investigators initially believed that Urban might still have been alive when the truck reached Breitscheidplatz and might have been stabbed because he tried to stop the attack. Early media reports indicated that he grabbed the steering wheel, forcing the truck to veer left and crash to a stop, and was then shot at the scene of the crash. If this had been true, this act might have had saved many lives. However, later media reports have indicated that the truck was brought to a stop by its <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> system and Urban was stabbed and shot hours before the attack. No weapons were found at the scene.|$|E

2500|$|One new feature, commercially {{available}} in saws since 2005, is an <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> system. [...] The feature's inventor, {{after trying to}} license it to manufacturers without success, started SawStop, based in Tualatin, Oregon. [...] SawStop's saws apply {{a small amount of}} electric current to the blade of the saw. [...] This current is continuously monitored. If the saw detects a change in this current (as would occur if a hand or other body part came into contact with the blade) an <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> system is activated, forcing an aluminum brake block into the blade. [...] The saw stops within five milliseconds, and angular momentum retracts the blade into the table. [...] The operator suffers a small nick instead of an amputation or other more serious injury.|$|E
50|$|The Richmond and Petersburg had 10 locomotives, 7 {{passenger}} cars, 3 baggage cars, 71 {{freight cars}} and 6 other cars, including cabooses in 1893.

25|$|The <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> {{works by}} {{monitoring}} the speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a brake valve, and the <b>brakes</b> operate. The <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> can only be released after the train has come to a stop, and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{frequently}} ignored {{safety regulation}} {{mentioned in the}} report was the [...] "deadman's pedal", which a locomotive engineer had to keep depressed for the train to remain underway. [...] Were he to fall asleep or pass out, his foot would slip from the pedal, triggering an alarm and engaging the train's brakes automatically a few seconds later. [...] However, many engineers found this tiresome and bypassed the pedal by placing a heavy weight (often a worn out brake shoe) on it. [...] It was uncertain whether the pedal had been bypassed {{in this case because}} the lead locomotive of the train had been destroyed. [...] A more advanced safety device was available, the reset safety control (RSC), which required crew members to take an action such as pushing a button at regular intervals, or else <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> would occur, but neither lead locomotive was equipped with this safety feature. [...] While the second locomotive in the freight train was equipped with RSC, it was not assigned as the lead locomotive because it lacked a [...] "comfort cab". [...] Management and union practice was to place more comfortable locomotives at the front of trains, even at the expense of safety.|$|E

25|$|For {{increased}} safety, each {{vehicle is}} also fitted with an <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> that is triggered if the vehicle exceeds a specific speed, {{such as a}} carriage running away or a locomotive engine failure. This system slows the train down using the same brake blocks and drums as the hand brake. The running speed at which the <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> comes on is lower for the carriages than the locomotive, to prevent a carriage running into a stationary locomotive further down the track.|$|R
50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>Braking</b> Type: The <b>automatic</b> <b>braking</b> type {{use either}} a single or {{combination}} of sensors (radar, lidar,and camera) {{to allow the}} vehicle {{to keep pace with}} the car it is following, slow when closing in on the vehicle in front and accelerating again to the preset speed when traffic allows.
