5|$|Carpet weaving {{represents}} a traditional art, {{dating back to}} pre-Islamic times. During its long history, the art and craft of the woven carpet has integrated different cultural traditions.

The arrival of Islam {{and the development of}} the Islamic art also influenced Turkish carpet design.

5|$|Deep ecology is a {{movement}} founded by Arne Naess that establishes principles {{for the well-being of}} all life on Earth and the richness <b>and</b> <b>diversity</b> of life forms. The movement advocates, among other things, a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will {{improve the quality of life}} rather than the standard of living. Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen. The concept of a billion-year Sustainocene has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species (for example through artificial photosynthesis) allowing Rights of Nature.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} and pollution are major threats to their conservation; river otters are highly sensitive to pollution and readily accumulate {{high levels of}} mercury, organochloride compounds, and other chemical elements. The species is often used as a bioindicator because of its position {{at the top of}} the food chain in aquatic ecosystems. Environmental disasters, such as oil spills, may increase levels of blood haptoglobin and interleukin-6 immunoreactive protein, but decrease body mass. Home ranges of river otters increase in size on oiled areas compared to unoiled areas, and individual otters also modify their habitat use. Declines in the richness <b>and</b> <b>diversity</b> of prey species may explain these changes.|$|E
5|$|Historical records {{indicate}} river otters were once populous throughout most major drainages {{in the continental}} United States and Canada prior to European settlement.

In addition, riverine habitats in interior regions supported smaller, but practical, otter populations. The otter existed on {{all parts of the}} Pacific Coast, including the seashore and inland streams and lakes. However, large populations never occurred in areas of Southern California such as the chaparral and oak woodlands and Mojave Desert seasonal waterway regions, or in the xeric shrubland regions in New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, and Colorado. In Mexico, the otters lived in the Rio Grande and Colorado River Deltas.|$|E

But these debates seem meaningless because {{most of them were}} based on different definitions. In this paper, diversity has two components: richness based on the total number and evenness based on the relative abundance. Species diversity is distinguished into individual-counting <b>diversity</b> <b>and</b> biomass-based <b>diversity.</b> Ecotope diversity is divided into individual ecotope-counting <b>diversity</b> <b>and</b> ecotope-area based <b>diversity.</b> Under this definition, we make a comprehensive investigation into Dongzhi tableland of Loess Plateau by cooperating with local technicians. We find that individual-counting diversity is significantly correlated with biomass-based diversity in grassland ecosystems; individual ecotope-counting <b>diversity</b> <b>and</b> ecotope-area based <b>diversity</b> have a significant correlation. Therefore, it is unnecessary to divide species diversity into individual-counting <b>diversity</b> <b>and</b> biomass-based <b>diversity</b> in grassland ecosystems and to distinguish ecotope diversity into individual ecotope-counting <b>and</b> ecotope-area based <b>diversity</b> for the issues that have no special requirement for accuracy. But the analyses of the investigation data demonstrate that species diversity has no significant correlation with ecotope diversity...|$|R

A few lensmakers and natural philosophers had been creating crude microscopes since the late 16th century, and Robert Hooke published the seminal Micrographia based on observations with his own compound microscope in 1665. But it was not until Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's dramatic improvements in lensmaking beginning in the 1670s—ultimately producing up to 200-fold magnification with a single lens—that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the sheer strangeness <b>and</b> <b>diversity</b> of microscopic life. Similar investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and built the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.|$|E

A sampling program showed declines at all sampling sites. A correlation has been posited between the observed decline in coral reef coverage throughout the Florida Reef tract {{and the decline}} in fish species. Declines in populations were noted in both gamefish and in fish species not exposed to fishing pressure. Algal cover has increased as coral has declined, so that coral-dwelling species have decreased while herbivorous fish have increased. Increased overall salinity and changing salinity gradients in Biscayne Bay may also play a role, while polychlorinated biphenyl and mercury contamination have been noted in fish samples.|$|E

40|$|QuestionHow do pollen-based {{functional}} <b>and</b> phylogenetic <b>diversity</b> help {{to explain}} post-glacial vegetation change in relation to climate and human influence? LocationEstonia and Latvia, NE Europe. MethodsWe used a data set of 1062 pollen samples from 20 sites covering the last 14500 yrs to estimate plant richness, evenness, functional <b>and</b> phylogenetic <b>diversity</b> (community-weighted mean <b>and</b> mean pair-wise distance). We adjusted existing functional <b>and</b> phylogenetic <b>diversity</b> measures for the pollen data and tested the methods with a simulation study. The simulations showed that species-based <b>and</b> pollen-based <b>diversity</b> estimates were all significantly positively correlated. ResultsThe Late Glacial (14500 - 11650 cal. yr BP) and the mid-Holocene (8000 - 4000 cal. yr BP) periods showed contrasting values {{for most of the}} <b>diversity</b> components, <b>and</b> several <b>diversity</b> estimates were strongly associated with climate. The cold climate during the Late Glacial led to high phylogenetic <b>diversity,</b> <b>and</b> relatively low functional diversity. Climate warming during the transition from the Late Glacial to the Holocene was followed by a decrease in phylogenetic diversity but an increase in functional diversity based on plant height and seed weight. Increasing human impact in the late Holocene was associated with an increase in plant richness and decreases in functional diversity based on plant height and seed weight <b>and</b> in phylogenetic <b>diversity</b> of herbs. ConclusionsPollen-based functional <b>and</b> phylogenetic <b>diversity</b> provide novel insights into post-glacial vegetation change and its drivers. Both functional <b>and</b> phylogenetic <b>diversity</b> were closely related to climatic conditions, suggesting that trait differences {{play an important role in}} long-term community response to climate change. Our results indicate that human impact during the last two millennia has influenced functional <b>and</b> phylogenetic <b>diversity</b> negatively by suppressing plants with certain traits (functional convergence) and giving advantage to plants from certain phylogenetic lineages. We see great potential in the further development of functional <b>and</b> phylogenetic <b>diversity</b> methods for pollen data...|$|R
