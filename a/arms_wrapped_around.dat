25|$|Kelvin's clothed {{body was}} found by a {{geologist}} on 24 July 1983. Little effort was put into concealing the body; Kelvin was found wearing the same Channel 9 shirt, blue jeans and white sneakers which he wore {{on the day of}} his abduction, together with the dog collar fitted around his neck. The {{body was found}} placed in the fetal position, with his legs bent towards his chest and his head forwards and his <b>arms</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> his legs. This made police suspect that Kelvin had been dumped by a single person, most likely after nightfall in order to avoid detection.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} water around weirs can often appear {{relatively}} calm, {{they can be}} extremely dangerous places to boat, swim, or wade, as the circulation patterns on the downstream side—typically called a hydraulic jump— can submerge a person indefinitely. This phenomenon is so well known to canoeists, kayakers, and others who spend time on rivers that they even have a rueful name for weirs: [...] "drowning machines". [...] If caught in this situation, the Ohio DNR recommends that a victim should [...] "tuck the chin down, draw the knees up to the chest with <b>arms</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> them. Hopefully, conditions will be such that the current will push the victim along {{the bed of the}} river until swept beyond the boil line and released by the hydraulic." [...] The Pennsylvania State Police also recommends to [...] "curl up, dive to the bottom, and swim or crawl downstream". [...] As the hydraulic entrains air, the buoyancy of the water between the dam and boil line will be reduced by upwards of 30%, and if a victim is unable to float, escape {{at the base of the}} dam may be the only option for survival.|$|E
2500|$|There is also, however, a {{cultural}} dimension to anti-Americanism among religious and conservative {{groups in the}} Middle East. It may have its origins with Sayyid Qutb. Qutb, an Egyptian who was the leading intellectual of the Muslim Brotherhood, studied in Greeley, Colorado from 1948 to 1950, and wrote a book, The America I Have Seen (1951) based on his impressions. In it he decried everything in America from individual freedom and taste in music to Church socials and haircuts. Wrote Qutb, [...] "They danced to the tunes of the gramophone, and the dance floor was replete with tapping feet, enticing legs, <b>arms</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> waists, lips pressed to lips, and chests pressed to chests. The atmosphere was full of desire..." [...] He offered a distorted chronology of American history and was disturbed by its sexually liberated women: [...] "The American girl is well acquainted with her body's seductive capacity. She knows it lies in the face, and in expressive eyes, and thirsty lips. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs – and she shows all this and does not hide it". He was particularly disturbed by jazz, which he called the American's preferred music, and which [...] "was created by Negroes to satisfy their love of noise and to whet their sexual desires ..." [...] Qutb's writings influenced generations of militants and radicals in the Middle East who viewed America as {{a cultural}} temptress bent on overturning traditional customs and morals, especially {{with respect to the}} relations between the sexes.|$|E

The song's first line ("Rollin' down a backwoods, Tennessee byway; one arm on the wheel") soon led into an image of the main character's other <b>arm</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> his girlfriend and - with a long, hard work week at an end - envisioning a weekend of fun and relaxation with her.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} a {{backdrop}} driver, the attacking wrestler stands behind his opponent and puts his head under {{the arm of the}} opponent.

50|$|The wrestler {{bends over}} with the {{opponent}} standing {{to the side of}} the wrestler. The wrestler then pulls the opponent's arm over their far shoulder and distributes the wrestler's body over their shoulders while having the other hand between and holding onto one of the opponent's legs and stands up. The opponent is draped face-down across the wrestler's shoulders, with the wrestler's <b>arms</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> from behind. It is a key component of several throws, drops and slams.|$|E
50|$|The attackers {{stand behind}} the {{opponent}} {{on either side of}} him and put their heads under his arms. They then lift the opponent up using their <b>arms</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> his torso, falling backwards and dropping the opponent flat on the mat in elevating the opponent so that he/she is lifted and held upside-down before the attackers fall to their backs driving the opponent down to the mat front-first, behind the attackers, as in a belly-to-back suplex. A slingshot variation is also possible.|$|E
50|$|A Star Promenade is {{an entirely}} {{different}} call but nevertheless part of the family.

40|$|AbstractThe {{structure}} of γδ resolvase complexed with a 34 bp substrate DNA {{has been determined}} at 3. 0 Å resolution. The DNA is sharply bent by 60 ° toward the major groove {{and away from the}} resolvase catalytic domains at the recombination crossover point. The C-terminal on third of resolvase, which was disordered in the absence of DNA, forms an arm and a 3 -helix DNA-binding domain {{on the opposite side of}} the DNA from the N-terminal domain. The <b>arms</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>around</b> the minor groove of the central 16 bp, and the DNA-binding domains interact with the major grooves near the outer boundaries of the binding site. The resolvase dimer is asymmetric, particularly in the arm region, implying a conformational adaptability that may be important for resolvase binding to different DNA sites in the synaptosome. It also raises the possibility of a sequential single-strand cleavage mechanism...|$|R

50|$|Nude (Charis, Santa Monica) is a {{photograph}} taken by Edward Weston in 1936. It shows an apparently nude woman with her <b>arms</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> her legs while she sits on a blanket in bright sunlight against a darkened doorway. The dynamic balance of the light and dark accentuate the curves and angles of the woman's body; {{at the same time}} her face and all but the slightest hint of her pubic area are hidden from view, requiring the viewer to concentrate on her arms, legs, feet and hands. It is an image of a nude that concentrates solely on the forms of the body rather than the sexuality. The model was his muse and assistant, Charis Wilson, whom he married a year later.|$|E
5000|$|After {{he tells}} them this story, Diane begins labour, and is taken to the hospital, where she {{delivers}} a baby girl. Mark, Elena, and Joaquin visit Diane in the hospital. Unable to tell Diane the [...] "end of the story," [...] Mark {{walks up to the}} roof and considers jumping. Joaquin and Elena follow him and {{he tells them}} that he had jumped in a river with David's <b>arms</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> his neck and that once in the water, he could no longer breathe. He released David from his grip and let him go. He tearfully admits that he felt guilty about not bringing him home. Elena embraces him and the film ends with Plato's quote: [...] "Only the dead see the end of the war." ...|$|E
5000|$|The pound hug (also {{referred}} to as a pound shake, hip-hop hug, one-armed hug, dude hug, cootie hug, homie hug, shug, hetero hug, bro-grab, bro hug, brah hug, thug hug, man-hug, or a daps) is a stylized greeting, exclusively performed between two people, that consists of a combination of a handshake and one-armed hug. Unlike the traditional hug, which symbolically and effectively removes interpersonal barriers and unites the two persons embracing, the pound hug—performed by keeping the right hand locked in handshake while the left <b>arm</b> <b>wraps</b> <b>around</b> the other's shoulder—interposes the obstacle of the two right arms to the joining of the two bodies. This type of hug has been frequently used in urban cities and hip hop culture since the late 80s. An example of the pound hug aka bro hug {{can be seen in the}} Tupac Video [...] "I get around" [...] in 1993.|$|R
50|$|The wrestler {{lifts the}} {{opponent}} {{up on his}} right shoulder, as in a front powerslam. Then, the left <b>arm</b> is <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> the opponent's neck and the right arm around the opponent's torso. The wrestler then sits down while dropping the opponent vertically to the right side, driving the opponent neck- and shoulder- first into the mat. The move was innovated by Mitsuharu Misawa and is technically known as a sitout side powerslam.|$|R
2500|$|Utamaro {{achieves}} a strong compositional balance despite the painting's complexity. [...] He distributes 27 figures throughout it amongst several buildings, {{such as a}} teahouse duplexes and a second-storey restaurant-teahouse at the left. [...] The main building {{appears to be a}} two-story restaurant-teahouse; the picture focuses on an atrium with a garden court in the middle surrounded by railings, revealing the snowy outdoors. [...] With the exception of the young boy who reaches out at a cat in the lower left, all the figures are women, though in real life the guests of a pleasure house would be men. [...] Several of the figures pose {{in a manner similar to}} those in the book Seirō Ehon Nenjū Gyōji (1804) that Utamaro illustrated around the time he completed this painting, such as the woman looking behind her in the hallway in the centre, the woman with her <b>arm</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> a pillar in the centre, and the woman crouched down near her with her hand on the railing, looking to the right behind her.|$|R
5000|$|The {{painting}} gained attention among contemporary French art critics, {{and remains}} one of Flandrin's best-known works, despite being produced relatively early in his career. The subject is an unidentified youth, an [...] "ephebe", who sits nude on a rock with his <b>arms</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> his legs and his head resting on his knees, eyes closed. There is a sea in the background, and no distinguishable landmarks locate the figure. The enigmatic scene provides no explanation for the figure's pose: Théophile Gautier (1811-1872) commented {{that the young man}} could be shipwrecked on a deserted island, or be a shepherd who has lost his flock. Ultimately, any explanation for this scene is left to the imagination, leading to comparisons with Surrealist art in the twentieth century.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the second}} day of trial, [...] "Victim 1", the {{youngest}} of Sandusky's alleged victims, testified to over 20 incidents of abuse, including unwanted and forced oral sex, by Sandusky during 2007 and 2008 while the boy was a participant in Sandusky's Second Mile program. The boy was 11 or 12 years old when the sexual abuse started. Mike McQueary, former Penn State graduate assistant football coach, testified that in 2001 in a Penn State locker room, he heard [...] "skin on skin" [...] slapping sounds coming from the showers. McQueary testified that he then saw Sandusky naked behind a 10- to 12-year-old boy propped against a shower wall, with [...] "Sandusky's <b>arms</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> the boy's midsection in the closest proximity that I think you could be in." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cuddling is {{a related}} form of {{physical}} intimacy {{in which two}} people hold one another with each person's <b>arms</b> <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> the other's body. Cuddling can be with family members, friends or lovers. In 2014, British sociologists Eric Anderson and Mark McCormack published a study which shows that 93% of British heterosexuals student-athletes had spooned or cuddled with a male friend, {{as a sign of}} friendship. [...] Similar to hugging, cuddling is a more affectionate and intimate embrace, normally done {{for a longer period of}} time (usually lasting from a few minutes to several hours). In contrast to hugging, which can often be a nonverbal greeting or parting tradition, cuddling is usually shared between two people who are lying down together or sitting somewhere in an intimate manner. Like hugging, cuddling makes the body release oxytocin, which has a variety of effects.|$|E
50|$|In wrestling, a bear hug, {{also known}} as a bodylock, is a {{grappling}} clinch hold and stand-up grappling position where the <b>arms</b> are <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> the opponent, either around the opponent's chest, midsection, or thighs, sometimes with {{one or both of the}} opponent's arms pinned to the opponent's body. The hands are locked around the opponent and the opponent is held tightly to the chest. The bear hug is a dominant position, with great control over the opponent, and also allows an easy takedown to the back mount position.|$|R
50|$|Mission 3 {{took place}} on November 14, 2009 on the Black Sea. Romanian Naval Forces participated at the mission with one {{logistical}} ship, one divers ship and another fast craft. For this mission ARCA constructed the largest stratospheric helium balloon to date. An error in construction caused the balloon's inflation <b>arms</b> to <b>wrap</b> <b>around</b> {{the base of the}} balloon when it was inflated. The team managed to unwrap the arms and to resume inflation but sunset was approaching and the solar balloon could no longer be used. The mission was cancelled.|$|R
5000|$|The wrestler {{grabs hold of}} one of his opponent's <b>arms,</b> <b>wraps</b> {{his legs}} <b>around</b> the opponent's throat and arm in a figure four and squeezes. Different {{promotions}} have different rules regarding the legality of this maneuver. The justification for its legality is that, like a head scissors, it uses the legs rather than the hands to perform the [...] "choke".|$|R
