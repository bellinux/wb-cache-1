5|$|Bruce was {{followed}} by Lawrence N. Maxwell, counsel for Beckham. Maxwell reiterated that the General Assembly had acted within its enumerated powers under the state constitution in deciding {{the outcome of the}} disputed election. He claimed that the decision of the state court of appeals made it clear that Taylor had not been legally elected governor, and therefore never possessed the property he was now claiming had been taken from him without due process. Maxwell further asserted that this disposed of any federal questions with regard to the case, and that the Supreme Court could claim no jurisdiction. The decision of the state court of appeals should be allowed to stand, he concluded. Lewis McQuown further argued on behalf of Beckham that, even if Taylor's claim to the governorship were legitimate, the investigation and decision by the General Assembly's contest committee represented sufficient due process. He acknowledged that the Goebel Election Law's provision that the legislature be the <b>arbiter</b> <b>of</b> any contested gubernatorial election differed little if at all from provisions in as many as twenty other states. If the Goebel Election Law was constitutional, as it had before been declared, then the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction regarding how it had been administered.|$|E

The editors of Us Weekly and People wield {{significant}} influence over public recognition of celebrities. Since the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (“FTDA”) amended the Lanham Act in 1995, federal courts have adopted similar roles as <b>arbiters</b> <b>of</b> fame, determining which trademarks are sufficiently famous to receive federal protection against dilution. Recent {{changes to the}} Lanham Act, however, reserve the availability of dilution actions to “A-list” marks.

5000|$|As {{so often}} happens in America, the {{so-called}} <b>arbiters</b> <b>of</b> good taste {{looked across the}} Atlantic for their models and scorned that which was home-grown. And such was their influence, then as now, that an uncertain population, striving for cultural respectability, embraced the common practice of European art music. Those who studied in Europe or in the European model cultivated a social superiority. ... These <b>arbiters</b> <b>of</b> taste did not represent {{the mean of the}} population. Their influence left the many congregations without a music to which they could identify. An interest in church singing waned, giving way to the quartet choir.
