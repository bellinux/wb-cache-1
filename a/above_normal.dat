5|$|Some {{residents}} on Dauphin Island voluntarily evacuated, {{spurred by}} memories of 1979's Hurricane Frederic and Jeanne's northward motion. 3,000 workers evacuated their oil rigs because of Jeanne's high waves. The National Hurricane Center advised small watercraft {{to remain in}} ports from Brownsville to Tarpon Springs. Forecasters expected tides of 2feet <b>above</b> <b>normal</b> in Louisiana, which increased to 4feet <b>above</b> <b>normal</b> along coastal Texas. In Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes, schools were closed because of uncertainties regarding Jeanne's path. The hurricane center also expected Jeanne to make landfall in southwestern Louisiana, although the hurricane eventually stayed offshore; thousands of residents moved inland, while Civil Defense officials remained alert. Forecasters expected locally heavy rainfall, although they suggested it would remain below 8inches (203mm).|$|E
