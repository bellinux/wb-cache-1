60|$|In {{the middle}} of the clearing, {{surrounded}} by a wooden stockade, stood the village, a group of rude detached huts. The marksmen each possessed a separate little homestead, consisting usually of a small wooden house or shanty, a courtyard, and a cattle-fold. So far, private property in land had already begun. But the forest and the pasture land were not appropriated: each man had a right from year to year to let loose his kine or horses on a certain equal or proportionate space of land assigned to him by the village in council. The wealth of the people consisted mainly in cattle which fed on the pasture, and pigs turned out to fatten on the acorns of the forest: but {{a small portion of the}} soil was ploughed and sown; and this portion also was distributed to the villagers for tillage by <b>annual</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The hall of the chief rose in the midst of the lesser houses, open to all comers. The village moot, or assembly of freemen, met in the open air, under some sacred tree, or beside some old monumental stone, often a relic of the older aboriginal race, marking the tomb of a dead chieftain, but worshipped as a god by the English immigrants. At these informal meetings, every head of a family had a right to appear and deliberate. The primitive English constitution was a pure republican aristocracy or oligarchy of householders, like that which still survives in the Swiss forest cantons.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- A {{microwave}} Focused Beam transmission measurement {{is identified}} as {{a good candidate for}} fast, accurate and affordable industrial wood testing. In this paper, the transmission measurement setup, in its various forms, is applied to the measurement of wood properties, considering wood as an anisotropic, heterogeneous, multiphase dielectric. The depolarization of a linearly polarized plane wave in an anisotropic media is considered first. It is used for grain angle detection for arbitrary grain inclination in three-dimensional space. A good correlation with visually inspected grain angle values is obtained. A scattering experiment is performed, measuring the transmission through the wood when the transmitting and the receiving antenna axes are at the right angle. The results indicate that the <b>annual</b> ring <b>arrangement</b> strongly influences the scattering in the sideways direction, while other investigated parameters (defects, gradual density variation, bulk density) show poor correlation with measured scattering coefficient...|$|R

40|$|As water extractions {{from the}} world's rivers have grown, flows {{available}} for the environment have dwindled. In {{many parts of the}} world governments are now considering strategies to restore environmental flows. One strategy is for a government to buyback water from irrigators for the environment with <b>annual</b> lease <b>arrangements.</b> In this paper we have studied the role of market competition (in terms of environmental water demand and number of sellers) in determining the performance of multi-round environmental water buyback auctions using a stylized agent based simulation model. The results suggest that rent extraction lowers as the number of bidders increase and water demand decreases. However, we find significant differences in the way changes in demand and supply influence rent extraction. Reduction in water demand has much greater impact on rent extraction than increasing the number of bidders in the market. Further, in wet years (when supply is abundant relative to demand) bidders engage in more competitive bidding compared to cases in dry years. Results from the analysis indicate that government agencies benefit more from arranging buyback tenders (1) with a small target relative to tenders with a large bidder population and (2) with greater opportunities for the bidders to learn from the market in wet years compared to dry years.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. In 2000, the Government launched the Work-Life Balance Campaign, targeting employers to promote the benefits of flexible working for all employees. Although this campaign was not specifically aimed at parents or carers, the legislation restricted rights to apply {{for changes in the}} hours, timing or place of work to those employees with caring responsibilities. The then Department for Education and Employment (later the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) and now the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS)) carried out the first Work-Life Balance Survey (WLB 1) in 2000 (held at the UK Data Archive under SN 4465). It was used to assess how far employers operated work-life balance practices and whether employees felt that existing practices met their needs. The first survey was followed up in 2003 by a second survey, a two-part survey of employees and employers (WLB 2) (held under SNs 5079 and 5080) and by a third wave in 2006 and 2007 (WLB 3) (held under SNs 7028 and 5787). The fourth employee survey was carried out in 2011 (held under SN 7112) and the fourth employers survey was completed in 2013 (held under SN 7775). The aims of the second Work-Life Balance Study were two-fold: firstly, to monitor change since the 2000 Work-Life Balance baseline study (held under SN 4465) by collecting data on (a) employer provision of work-life balance practices and policies, (b) employee take-up of, and demand for, these initiatives, and (c) the impact of employers' provisions (including costs and benefits); secondly, to establish a robust baseline for future evaluation of the provisions brought in under the Employment Act 2002. The findings of the research will be used to track changes since the first study and assess the impact of new legislation governing leave entitlements and employers' flexible working practices on different cross-sections of the population. The employees' survey objectives included: assessing employees' awareness of the current statutory leave entitlements, including maternity leave, parental leave, and time off for dependents, as well as forthcoming new rights; assessing take-up of work-life balance practices including reasons for non take-up (e. g. impact on job security and promotion); ascertaining the demand for work-life balance practices; establishing the extent to which work-life balance practices meet employee needs, including views on the feasibility of employers extending these arrangements; and ascertaining employees' views on the impact of work-life balance practices. The Employers' Survey is held under SN 5080.

30|$|The virtual {{power plant}} can be {{regarded}} as a flexible entity in the whole sale electricity market, and the object of DR program is to reduce the peak hour consumption and the shift demand to offpeak hours [28]. For long-term economic benefits of DR program, it is currently used to avoid peak load capacity cost, but the method has the following three defects: 1) Peak load capacity investment is related with <b>annual</b> peak demand <b>arrangements,</b> but the peak price is not always synchronized with the peak load. During annual peak load period, it is unnecessary to involve demand response. However, during the off-peak period, the price will be influenced by the power supply or system peak emergency event. 2) There is not a certain relation for fluctuation between the load behavior and the price, the daily demand of all connected consumers and power scheduling approach is commonly regarded as a game with probability distribution. 3) It is controversial about the accuracy of the peak load capacity measurement, as its benchmark value is the load that probably happens but does not happen, so {{it is difficult to determine}} the baseline for further user compensation.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} comprehensive {{empirical evidence}} {{that supports the}} predictions of Sargent and Wallace''s (1981) "unpleasant monetarist arithmetic" that an increase in public debt is typically inflationary in countries with large public debt. Drawing on an extensive panel dataset, {{we find that the}} relationship holds strongly in indebted developing countries, weakly in other developing countries, but generally not in developed economies. These results are robust to the inclusion of other variables, corrections for endogeneity biases, and relaxation of common-slope restrictions and are invariant over sub-sample periods. We estimate a VAR to trace out the transmission channel and find the impulse responses consistent with the predictions of a forward-looking model of inflation. Wealth effects of public debt could also affect inflation, as posited by the fiscal theory of the price level, but we do not find supportive evidence. The results suggest that the risk of a debt-inflation trap is significant in highly indebted countries, and pure money-based stabilization is unlikely to be effective over the medium term. Our findings stress the importance of institutional and structural factors in the link between fiscal policy and inflation.

40|$|Microwave {{non-destructive}} testing of wood {{is an active}} research field, but, despite remarkable advances {{reported in the literature}} to date, the wood testing devices are not widely implemented in industry. This thesis aims to progress the knowledge on wood testing by investigating two of the key issues: microwave propagation through dried wood and sensor design. Two microwave antennas with focused beam are designed and implemented. First antenna is a commonly used horn with a dielectric lens, offering a broadband solution, operating over the 8 to 12. 4 GHz frequency band. The second solution is a novel metal plate lens antenna with beam forming in the near field zone. A successful beam forming and focusing is achieved, but a narrowband characteristic prevented application of this sensor for microwave wood testing considered in this thesis. A microwave system for a free-space measurement of wood properties is, in its various forms, applied to measurement of wood properties, considering wood as an anisotropic, heterogeneous and multiphase dielectric. Microwave free-space transmission measurement methods are considered, analysing error sources and available mitigation techniques. A focused-beam transmission measurement setup with free-space calibration has been identified as an optimum solution for microwave wood testing. The properties of this measurement system are analysed, having in mind its application for wood measurement in industrial environment. The samples for the study are carefully chosen to cover a range of features frequently met in practice. The ‘actual’ sample properties, against which the performance microwave measurements are judged, are determined using visual inspection and CT scan. The theoretical background on electromagnetic wave propagation through anisotropic media is considered. Of particular interest is depolarisation of a linear plane wave in anisotropic media, which is also demonstrated experimentally. A simple case of grain inclination in a plane is considered first, demonstrating experimentally that grain inclination directly relates to the level of depolarisation. This is then applied to a general case, in which the grain is inclined in three-dimensional space. It is shown that the technique has a good correlation with visually inspected grain angle values, but additional sensor calibration is recommended. Heterogeneity of the sample is analysed using the same set of sensors, but in different arrangement. The aim was to detect variations in wood structure and investigate a method for automated categorisation of wood samples, based on the type of defect. The categorisation of samples is considered as a way to combat a great variability in sample properties and allow easier and more accurate empirical modelling. The microwave transmission measurement data are compared with CT scans and visual inspection of samples. Good results are achieved, not only for samples with distinctive defects such as knots, but for samples with needle flecks, resin pockets and change in <b>annual</b> ring <b>arrangement</b> along the axial direction. Heterogeneity study is then extended to include an analysis of effects which gradual variations in wood structure have on the measured microwave signal. The obtained results show that phase of the microwave transmission coefficient {{can be used as a}} good indicator of slow variation in sample density. The study also includes an analysis of free space calibration and broadband transmission measurement, investigating its positive sides such as improved accuracy, as well as its negative sides such as complexity which these procedures introduce in an industrial process. Techniques for combating residual error are investigated, offering the frequency averaging as an easily implemented option. The importance of working over a frequency bandwidth is demonstrated, for dealing with phase periodicity as well as combating measurement uncertainty. Response calibration is considered as an affordable option which can remove some of the systematic errors, yet is less disruptive for the industrial process. Furthermore, both moisture content and density distribution are considered, as well as bulk properties, averaged over the whole sample volume. It has been demonstrated that both moisture and density of wood contribute to the changes in microwave transmission coefficient. Measured data reveal a polarisation dependence of the moisture related transmission magnitude, which may be used as additional information in attempt to distinguish between the contributors. This was further investigated on the set of samples observed at several moisture content values. The correlation between bulk density and microwave measured density improves when samples with knots are omitted, demonstrating advantage of sample categorisation. In the final section of the thesis, the scattering experiment is performed, measuring the transmission through the wood when transmitting and the receiving antenna axes are at the right angle. This experiment shows that maximum transmission in this direction correlates best with the <b>arrangement</b> of <b>annual</b> rings in the sample, indicating possible existence of guided modes in the layered media. This finding is significant as it demonstrates the complexity of microwave propagation model for the sample with such complex structure...|$|R
40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Australian Taxation Office’s administration of <b>annual</b> compliance <b>arrangements</b> with large corporate taxpayers. Audit objective and criteria To form a conclusion against this objective, the ANAO adopted the following high-level criteria: 	the governance arrangements for ACAs are well planned and effective; 	there are sound processes for identifying entities to enter into an ACA; 	results achieved to date reflect initial expectations of ACAs; and 	individual ACAs are effectively administered, in accordance with internal policies and procedures, to achieve intended benefits. Overall conclusion ACAs were introduced in 2008 in response to feedback from large corporate taxpayers that {{they were looking for a}} ‘no surprises’ approach in relation to their tax positions. Built on the premise that taxpayers would have sound tax governance arrangements and provide full and true disclosure, ACAs aim to provide taxpayers with greater practical certainty of their tax positions. The ATO sees ACAs as the premium cooperative compliance arrangement for large corporate taxpayers. As such, they are closely aligned with the ATO’s 2020 vision, which embraces real-time engagement and disclosure as well as a lighter touch for compliant taxpayers. The effective administration of ACAs relies on judgements by the ATO as to the soundness of the governance arrangements put in place by large corporate taxpayers, the reliability of the information they disclose on significant matters affecting their taxation liability, and the review of this information by the ATO on an annual basis. While not without risks to both parties, this approach is consistent with contemporary international practice of building cooperative relationships with those larger corporate taxpayers considered willing to meet their tax obligations and unlikely to be involved in aggressive tax planning practices. ACAs have also delivered benefits to participating taxpayers. These taxpayers advised the ANAO that the arrangements have provided greater certainty for more straightforward taxation matters and improved the ATO’s responsiveness to their concerns. Notwithstanding the positive experiences of participating taxpayers, take-up of ACAs has been low. In 2013 – 14 only 24 of the 158 potentially suitable key taxpayers (15  per cent) had an ACA, and six of these taxpayers would not be categorised as ‘key’ under the current risk assessment arrangements. As such, ACAs have not been the centrepiece of cooperative collaboration with large corporate taxpayers as envisaged when introduced, but do provide an alternative approach for large corporate taxpayers to engage with the ATO on potentially contentious tax matters. Most large corporate taxpayers are aware of ACAs as a result of the ATO’s promotional efforts but prefer to be subject to alternate compliance activities, such as pre-lodgment compliance reviews, instead of voluntarily entering into an ACA. Taxpayers have advised the ANAO and the ATO that the main reason for not entering into an ACA was the relatively high cost of meeting the requirements of the ACA, particularly at the entry phase. They perceived other compliance activities to have similar benefits but lower administrative demands. Although the ATO has not quantified the cost of participating in or administering an ACA, it recognises these concerns, and is looking to better tailor the intensity of its compliance activity to the assessed risk, as envisaged in its 2020 vision. ACAs currently provide a differentiated means by which the ATO can engage with large corporate taxpayers. If ACAs are to be positioned to maximise the participation of suitable large corporate taxpayers, it will be important for the ATO to reassess the extent of differentiation, taking into account the costs and benefits to taxpayers and itself. In this regard, the ATO will also have to decide whether ACAs are to be positioned more as part of the spectrum of compliance approaches going forward rather than as the centrepiece of cooperative collaboration as initially envisaged. In administering existing ACAs, shortcomings in recordkeeping and oversight have meant that the ATO could not readily demonstrate: the extent and outcomes of its efforts to gain assurance over taxpayers’ governance arrangements; the number, nature and treatment of disclosures; or success in encouraging higher levels of compliance on the part of those large corporate taxpayers with an ACA. Accordingly, the ATO has not administered ACAs as effectively as it could have, particularly when these arrangements were viewed as a flagship measure that provided a new and innovative way of engaging with large corporate taxpayers. Issues surrounding the design and administration of ACAs have been raised in recent internal and external reviews, in line with the findings of this audit. It is apparent the ATO needs to act on these findings to improve the effectiveness of ACAs if they are to achieve the benefits envisaged when the arrangements were introduced in 2008. Further, the ANAO has made two recommendations aimed at improving the design of ACAs, and the ATO’s recording of taxpayers’ disclosures of contentious tax positions and how they were dealt with through ACA processes...|$|R
