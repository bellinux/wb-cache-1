5|$|In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} it looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> succeed, by 1790, with the fears of revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, {{one of the most}} effective and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, William Pitt and Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E
25|$|Athy {{had to wait}} 24 {{years before}} {{reaching}} the summit of Kildare Senior Football once again. On 9 October 2011 in St Conleths Park Newbridge Michael Foley captained a young Athy side to victory against Carbury with a final score of 2.11 to 2.07. Athy scored 2–5 in the opening 15 minutes and two points in the closing four minutes but managed just four points in between, a period during which Carbury accumulated 2–4. Indeed, when Daryl O'Brien rasped home Carbury's second goal in the 57th minute {{to cut the deficit}} to two points, it looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have timed their run to perfection. The next score was crucial and it went Athy's way as Man of the Match Cian Reynolds held his nerve and calmly pointed a free.|$|E
25|$|In 1787, 1789 and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} it looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> succeed, by 1790, with the fears of the French revolution looming {{in the minds of}} many members of Parliament, few were swayed by Charles James Fox's arguments for equal rights. Political cartoons, one of the most effective and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley specifically. In the midst of these trying times, it was the betrayal of William Pitt and Edmund Burke that most angered Priestley and his friends; they had expected the two men's support and instead both argued vociferously against the repeal. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but to no avail. These publications unfortunately also inflamed the populace against him.|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps {{the men who}} {{ran away}} with the brig {{belong to the same}} gang who hid the paper," [...] Walter {{suggested}} in a tremulous tone, glancing behind him every few moments, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> fancying <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be pursued.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why am I {{to go off}} duty?" [...] Susan asked. [...] "Surely it can do us no harm {{to stand}} guard, {{and even though the}} savages do not make any move, we should act <b>as</b> <b>if</b> believing <b>they</b> <b>might</b> do so at any moment." ...|$|R
2500|$|Southern vowel {{breaking}} ("Southern drawl"): All {{three stages}} of the Southern Shift often result in the short front pure vowels being [...] "broken" [...] into gliding vowels, making one-syllable words like pet and pit sound <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have two syllables (as something like pay-it and pee-it respectively). This short front vowel gliding phenomenon is popularly recognized as the [...] "Southern drawl". The [...] "short a", [...] "short e", and [...] "short i" [...] vowels are all affected, developing a glide up from their original starting position to , and then often back down to a schwa vowel: and , respectively. This phenomenon is on the decline, being most typical of Southern speakers born before 1960, though mostly after the mid-1800s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new type}} was {{intended}} {{from the beginning}} to replace the B.E.2, which was already attracting widespread criticism, and an attempt was made to address each of the earlier type's failings. [...] The more powerful motor was intended to improve the feeble speed and climb of the B.E.2 and to allow a better payload. This permitted the type to operate as a true two-seater, since the observer no longer had to be left at home when bombs or a full fuel load were carried, {{there was no need for}} his seat to be at the centre of gravity – as a result he could now be seated behind the pilot, in the proper position to operate a defensive machine gun. It was also possible to allow for a pilot's gun. The new wings had already proved themselves on the B.E.2e, maintaining the stability of the B.E.2c while providing rather better manoeuvrability, although the long extensions on the upper wing looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> collapse if the aircraft was dived too sharply, which did not improve the trust in which they were held by some pilots. The new tail, as originally fitted, had a much smaller fin, which it was hoped would improve rudder control and allow the new type to turn more easily without seriously affecting stability.|$|E
60|$|The {{tools were}} very antique and venerable in their form, and looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have been hanging {{where they were}} {{untouched}} for centuries.|$|E
60|$|THE {{two boys}} flew on and on, toward the village, {{speechless}} with horror. They glanced backward {{over their shoulders}} from time to time, apprehensively, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> feared <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be followed. Every stump that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them catch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay near the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give wings to their feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, thank you! Aren't {{they just}} elegant? I never see such beauties," [...] stammered the poor boy, {{grasping}} his treasures <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he feared <b>they</b> <b>might</b> vanish away.|$|R
60|$|Joe {{went into}} every {{portion of the}} boat in which {{passengers}} are allowed; but without seeing either Ned's captor or his companion. Had he been on deck when the steamer arrived at Newport, he {{would have seen the}} two men land there, after searching vainly for the boy they had stolen, much <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> feared <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be called to an account for what they had done. Of this, of course, Joe knew nothing; and when he failed to see either of the men, he naturally feared they were waiting on shore in the hope of catching Ned as he landed.|$|R
60|$|Neither had he met any of {{the party}} whom he saw on his {{introduction}} to the city, and it seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> not give him any further trouble.|$|E
60|$|The boy was stowing the {{remainder}} of the cheese and crackers into his pockets when the shopkeeper, accompanied by two men, who looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have been hunters or miners, entered.|$|E
6000|$|... "They've {{got some}} sort of a deal on for {{handling}} horses and cattle. We couldn't make out exactly what it was," [...] answered Randy. [...] "But they certainly are a tough bunch. It looks to me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have been drinking." ...|$|E
60|$|Tim did not {{propose to}} {{start for the}} Run until his companions had {{concluded}} their business; his goods were packed ready for removal, {{and there was nothing}} better for him to do than accompany them to the court-room where it seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all <b>they</b> <b>might</b> say would result only in a long term of imprisonment for Hazelton before he could be tried on the baseless charge brought against him, simply because of the disreputable business in which he was engaged.|$|R
60|$|Reflections {{something}} like these {{passed through the}} mind of Eve Effingham, as she examined the mixed crowd, in which some were busy in receiving stores from boats; others in holding party conferences with friends, in which a few were weeping; {{here and there a}} group was drowning reflection in the parting cup; while wondering children looked up with anxiety into the well-known faces, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> fearful <b>they</b> <b>might</b> lose the countenances they loved, and the charities on which they habitually relied, in such a mêlée.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps our {{suspicions of}} the lad {{prompted}} {{us to see}} more than really was presented; but certain it is I fancied that the officer, who was mounted, plied Horry with questions, to which the lad replied <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it gave him pleasure to impart information. I also suspected they were saying somewhat concerning our plantation, for now and again Horry pointed {{in the direction of}} my home, and the foot soldiers looked back <b>as</b> <b>if</b> fancying <b>they</b> <b>might</b> see the buildings in the distance, all of which was the more real to me because betwixt where we stood and the Hamilton plantation there was no other dwelling.|$|R
60|$|On the {{way down}} the stream the Kansas {{soldiers}} demolished several huts, selecting the best of the timber with which to build their rafts. The moon was under a cloud, and it looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> get across the river without serious trouble.|$|E
6000|$|PURDIE. Rather not. We were--hoping {{it would}} be you. We want to start on the walk. I can't think what has become of the others. We {{have been looking for}} them everywhere. (He glances vaguely round the room, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> so far have escaped detection.) ...|$|E
60|$|Both of the {{travelers}} were very humbly clad, and looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> not have money enough {{in their pockets}} {{to pay for a}} night's lodging. And this, I am afraid, was the reason why the villagers had allowed their children and dogs to treat them so rudely.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not that}} he told me more than {{elsewhere}} I could have learnt; it was the cynical manner in which he conveyed his information. He {{had a way of}} telling me of monstrous things <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were purely normal and natural to a properly focussed eye, and <b>as</b> <b>if</b> any monstrousness <b>they</b> <b>might</b> present to me were due to some distortion imparted to them solely by the imperfection of my intellectual vision.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{little that}} they think of that. The sloop-of-war no sooner begun to fire than down went Mrs. Budd on the canvas floor of the tent, and set up just such a {{screaming}} as you may remember she tried her hand at the night the revenue craft fired into us. Biddy lay down alongside of her mistress, and at every gun, they just scream as loud <b>as</b> <b>they</b> can, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> fancied <b>they</b> <b>might</b> frighten off Uncle Sam's men from their duty." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{might well}} fill the breasts of the rescuers with anxiety. Their boat, when packed full, could only carry about thirty. However, a cheering reply was returned, and, seizing a {{favourable}} opportunity, {{two of the}} boatmen sprang on the wreck, clambered over the side, and leaped among the excited emigrants. Some seized them by the hands and hailed them as deliverers; others, half dead with terror, clung to them <b>as</b> <b>if</b> afraid <b>they</b> <b>might</b> forsake them. There was no time, however, to humour feelings. Shaking them all off--kindly but forcibly--the men went {{to work with a}} will, briefly explained that there was a steamer not far off, and began to get the women first into the boat.|$|R
60|$|It surely seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> better their {{condition}} very materially by making this change, and, {{in view of}} all things, it was the proper manoeuvre since by remaining {{there was no doubt}} the party would be discovered, when a regular siege must necessarily be the result.|$|E
6000|$|... "Steady, Phelps, steady," [...] {{warned the}} Brill captain. But {{it was of}} no avail, {{and the only way}} Brill could bring that inning to a finish was by the clever work of two of the fielders in {{capturing}} two flies which looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be home runs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello!" [...] {{said the}} voice of Farmer Brown's boy. [...] "These are queer tracks! That Skunk {{must have had a}} queer tail, for here are the marks of it in the snow, and they look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have been made by the tail of a very big rat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well! well! well! And is this true?' murmured the bewildered old nobleman, staring from James to Laura, {{and from}} Laura to James, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he fancied <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be figments of the imagination. 'Is this, then, James, {{the secret of}} your {{kindness}} to your old uncle in helping him to find his daughter? Good Heavens! What further depths of duplicity are there left {{for a man to}} learn!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I asked several natives about Maloka to-day," [...] Frank replied quietly; [...] "but {{though they}} all knew the name, they only laughed, and refused to answer. They seemed to think it an {{excellent}} joke. One of them said he didn't trouble himself at all about people like Maloka. And then they all looked very serious, and glanced around <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> thought he <b>might</b> possibly hear them. But when I asked if Maloka lived near by, behind the peaks, they burst into roars of laughter again, and advised me {{not to be too}} inquisitive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Transact in such manner, with secular persons, {{with whom}} you have {{familiarity}} or friendship, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you thought <b>they</b> <b>might</b> one day become your enemies: by this management of yourself, you will neither do nor say any thing of which you may have reason to repent you, and with which they may upbraid you in their passion. We are obliged to these precautions, by the sons of a corrupt generation, who are continually looking on the children of light with mistrustful and malignant eyes.|$|R
60|$|There was an {{embarrassing}} silence. The men {{looked at each}} other, and at the fire. Even with the appetizing banquet before them, it seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> again fall into the despondency of Thompson's grocery, when {{the voice of the}} Old Man, incautiously lifted, came deprecatingly from the kitchen.|$|E
60|$|A youth less stout {{of heart}} than Dave might have {{sat down and}} given up the case as hopeless. But our hero was not made of such stuff. He moved on slowly, in one {{direction}} and then another, trying out what looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be passages to the outer air.|$|E
6000|$|... "No? I am at fault, then. Yet {{they look}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be bumbailiffs. 'Tis the kind ye herd with, is't not? Give you good-even, Mr. Green." [...] And he went on, cool and unconcerned, {{and turned in}} through the narrow doorway by the glover's shop to mount the stairs to Sir Richard's lodging.|$|E
60|$|She fell {{to looking}} over her manuscripts. They were on lined paper, {{stitched}} together at the top. They were imitative, of course, and leaned toward the Elizabethan drama, and toward Tennyson and Mrs. Browning, so far as verse-form went. There were also essays which she had written at college, which inquired mournfully, who will {{take the place of}} the fallen giants, Bryant, Longfellow, Emerson? She had eloquent studies of Hugo and valiant defences of Dickens. She reflected in her writing (naturally) all the conventional positions in literature. She stood upon the graves of the dead <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she feared <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be desecrated.|$|R
6000|$|When {{they were}} {{directly}} {{in line with}} the windmill, as near to the shore as to the ship, and nearer the shore than we had ever allowed them before, they grew suspicious. We followed them through the glasses, and saw them standing up in the skiff and {{trying to find out what}} we were doing. The spy fisherman, sitting beside us on the stringer-piece was likewise puzzled. He could not understand our inactivity. The men in the skiff rowed nearer the shore, but stood up again and scanned it, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> thought we <b>might</b> be in hiding there. But a man came out on the beach and waved a handkerchief to indicate that the coast was clear. That settled them. They bent to the oars to make a dash for it. Still Charley waited. Not until they had covered three-quarters of the distance from the Lancashire Queen, which left them hardly more than a quarter of a mile to gain the shore, did Charley slap me on the shoulder and cry: ...|$|R
60|$|The mode of burial practised {{among the}} tribes {{on the coast}} is very peculiar. The corpse is placed {{sometimes}} in a canoe raised {{a few feet from}} the ground, with arms and other necessaries beside it. These are not unfrequently spoiled beforehand, to prevent their being stolen, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> thought <b>they</b> <b>might,</b> like their owner, be restored to their former state in the new world. Sometimes they are put in upright boxes like sentry-boxes--sometimes in small enclosures--but usually kept neat, and those of the chiefs frequently painted. Mount Coffin, at the mouth of the Cowelitz, seems to have been appropriated to the burial of persons of importance; it is about seven hundred feet high, and quite isolated: on it were to be seen the canoe-coffins of the natives in every stage of decay; they were hung between the trees about five feet from the ground. This cemetery of the Columbia is, however, destroyed, for the American sailors under Wilkes, neglecting to put out their cooking-fire, it spread over the whole mountain, and continued to rage through the night, till all was burnt. A few small presents appeased the Indians, who but a few years before could only have drowned the remembrance of such a national disgrace in the blood of those who caused it.|$|R
