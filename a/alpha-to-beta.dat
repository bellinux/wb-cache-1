40|$|Changes of {{molecular}} dynamics in the <b>alpha-to-beta</b> transition associated with amyloid fibril formation were explored on apomyoglobin (ApoMb) {{as a model}} system. Circular dichroism, neutron and X-ray scattering experiments were performed {{as a function of}} temperature on the protein, at different solvent conditions. A significant change in molecular dynamics was observed at the <b>alpha-to-beta</b> transition at about 55 degrees C, indicating a more resilient high temperature beta structure phase. A similar effect at approximately the same temperature was observed in holo-myoglobin, associated with partial unfolding and protein aggregation. A study in a wide temperature range between 20 and 360 K revealed that a dynamical transition at about 200 K for motions in the 50 ps time scale exists also for a hydrated powder of heat-denatured aggregated ApoMb...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIRfaH is a {{virulence}} factor from Escherichia coli whose C-terminal domain (CTD) {{undergoes a}} dramatic <b>alpha-to-beta</b> conformational transformation. The CTD in its alpha-helical fold is stabilized by {{interactions with the}} N-terminal domain (NTD), masking an RNA polymerase binding site until a specific recruitment site is encountered. Domain dissociation is triggered upon binding to DNA, allowing the NTD to interact with RNA polymerase to facilitate transcription while the CTD refolds into the alpha-barrel conformation that interacts with the ribosome to activate translation. However, structural details of this transformation process {{in the context of}} the full protein remain to be elucidated. Here, we explore the mechanism of the <b>alpha-to-beta</b> conformational transition of RfaH in the full-length protein using a dual-basin structure-based model. Our simulations capture several features described experimentally, such as the requirement of disruption of interdomain contacts to trigger the <b>alpha-to-beta</b> transformation, confirms the roles of previously indicated residues E 48 and R 138, and suggests a new important role for F 130, in the stability of the interdomain interaction. These native basins are connected through an intermediate state that builds up upon binding to the NTD and shares features from both folds, in agreement with previous in silico studies of the isolated CTD. We also examine the effect of RNA polymerase binding on the stabilization of the beta fold. Our study shows that native-biased models are appropriate for interrogating the detailed mechanisms of structural rearrangements during the dramatic transformation process of RfaH.

40|$|The interconversion of cell {{lineages}} via transdifferentiation is {{an adaptive}} mode of tissue regeneration and an appealing therapeutic target. However, its clinical exploitation is contingent upon {{the discovery of}} contextual regulators of cell fate acquisition and maintenance. In murine models of diabetes, glucagon-secreting alpha cells transdifferentiate into insulin-secreting beta cells following targeted beta cell depletion, regenerating the form and function of the pancreatic islet. However, the molecular triggers of this mode of regeneration are unknown. Here, using lineage-tracing assays in a transgenic zebrafish model of beta cell ablation, we demonstrate conserved plasticity of alpha cells during islet regeneration. In addition, we show that glucagon expression is upregulated after injury. Through gene knockdown and rescue approaches, we also find that peptides derived from the glucagon gene are necessary for <b>alpha-to-beta</b> cell fate switching. Importantly, whereas beta cell neogenesis was stimulated by glucose, <b>alpha-to-beta</b> cell conversion was not, suggesting that transdifferentiation is not mediated by glucagon/GLP- 1 control of hepatic glucose production. Overall, this study supports the hypothesis that alpha cells are an endogenous reservoir of potential new beta cells. It further reveals that glucagon {{plays an important role}} in maintaining endocrine cell homeostasis through feedback mechanisms that govern cell fate stability...|$|E
40|$|The overall solid-to-solid phase {{transformation}} kinetics under non-isothermal conditions has been modeled {{by means of}} a differential equation method. The method requires provisions for expressions of the fraction of the transformed phase in equilibrium condition and the relaxation time for transition as functions of temperature. The thermal history is an input to the model. We have used the method to calculate the time/temperature variation of the volume fraction of the favored phase in the <b>alpha-to-beta</b> transition in a zirconium alloy under heating and cooling, in agreement with experimental results. We also present a formulation that accounts for both additive and non-additive {{phase transformation}} processes. Moreover, a method based on the concept of path integral, which considers all the possible paths in thermal histories to reach the final state, is suggested. Comment: 16 pages, 7 figures.

40|$|Zirconium alloys {{are widely}} used by the nuclear {{industry}} as fuel cladding and structural materials. Many physical and metallurgical properties of zirconium alloys, that are important for their performance in nuclear reactors, are affected by crystallographic texture due to the strong anisotropy of individual crystals. Irradiation assisted growth is one example. Zirconium crystals deform anisotropically under irradiation, which {{in the presence of}} strong textures (like the ones observed in cold-rolled sheet) causes undesirable deformation of components during service. For this reason, the nuclear industry is interested in developing thermomechanical processes that produce random textures, taking advantage of the allotropic phase transformation undergone by zirconium, from the low temperature hcp alpha-phase to the high temperature bcc beta-phase. One of these processes is beta-quenching, which has showed certain success in weakening strong rolling textures. However, there is no consensus about the fundamental mechanisms involved. The aim of this work is to study the evolution of the texture of the zirconium alloy Zircaloy- 2 during beta-quenching, in order to gain understanding on the mechanisms involved on texture development and evolution during the <b>alpha-to-beta</b> and beta-to-alpha phase transformations. Firstly industrially beta-quenched samples were characterised using well known techniques such as laboratory X-ray diffraction (LXRD) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), which revealed a relationship between peak temperature and the inherited alpha texture. An in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) experiment provided, for the first time, information of texture evolution of zirconium during rapid changes and at non-ambient conditions. Different peak temperatures and stress/strain conditions were tested. Detailed post mortem EBSD characterisation of samples studied in situ provided insight on the relationship between the microstructure and the texture. Finally, laboratory furnaces were used to beta-quench samples at very high temperature. It was found that there is selection of orientation variants during beta-quenching of zirconium, but while the selection during the <b>alpha-to-beta</b> transformation is almost negligible, depending on the texture evolution of the beta-phase (affected by grain growth and/or plastic deformation), diverse mechanisms of variant selection act during the beta-to-alpha phase transformation. The inherited textures observed result from the combination of these mechanisms. Some of the results of this work can be transferred to other systems such as titanium and the alpha-gamma-alpha phase transformation in steel.

40|$|When poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) {{is to be}} used as a {{piezoelectric}} material, {{the processing}} must include the formation of polar beta-phase crystallites, as well as the application of electrically conducting charge collectors, that is, electrodes. In this article, results from the melt spinning of PVDF yarns and a novel bicomponent PVDF-yarn with a conductive carbon black/polypropylene (CB/PP) core are presented. Melt spinning has been done under conditions typical for industrial large-scale fiber production. The effects on the resulting crystalline structure of varying the spinning velocity, draw rate, and draw temperature are discussed. The results show that, for maximum <b>alpha-to-beta</b> phase transformation, cold drawing should take place at a temperature between 70 and 90 degrees C, and both the draw ratio and the draw rate should be as high as possible. It was observed that the cold drawing necessary to form beta-phase crystallinity simultaneously leads to a decrease in the core conductivity of the bicomponent yarns. In this work, the melt spinning of bicomponent fibers with high-beta-phase PVDF in the sheath and a CB/PP core was successfully accomplished. The core material remained electrically conductive, paving the way for the use of a CB-polymer compound as inner electrode in the melt spinning of piezoelectric bicomponent fibers...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: The lack of {{available}} beta cells greatly limits {{the use of}} beta cell transplantation as a therapy for diabetes. Thus, generation of beta cells from other sources is substantially required. Pax 4 {{has been shown to}} induce reprograming of alpha cells into beta cells during embryogenesis. Nevertheless, whether expression of Pax 4 in adult alpha cells could trigger this <b>alpha-to-beta</b> cell reprogramming is unknown. Methods: Here we generated an adeno-associated virus carrying Pax 4 and GFP under a CMV promoter (AAV-Pax 4). We used AAV-Pax 4 to transduce a mouse alpha cell line in vitro, and to transduce primary alpha cells in diabetic mice. Reprogramming was examined by double immunostaining and by changes in beta cell number. The effects on blood glucose were evaluated by fasting blood glucose and glucose response. Results: In vitro, Pax 4 overexpression neither induced insulin expression, nor suppressed glucagon expression in alpha cells. In vivo, Pax 4 overexpression failed to increase beta cell number, and did not alter hyperglycemia and glucose response in diabetic mice. Conclusion: Pax 4 expression is not sufficient to transduce pancreatic alpha cells into beta cells. Overexpression of Pax 4 in alpha cells may not increase functional beta cell number in diabetic patients...|$|E
40|$|A constrained, {{iterative}} Fourier deconvolution {{method is}} employed {{to enhance the}} resolution of Raman spectra of biological molecules for quantitative assessment of macromolecular secondary structures and hydrogen isotope exchange kinetics. In an application to the Pf 1 filamentous bacterial virus, it is shown that the Raman amide I band contains no component other than that due to alpha-helix, indicating the virtual 100 % helicity of coat proteins in the native virion. Comparative analysis of the amide I band of six filamentous phages (fd, If 1, IKe, Pf 1, Xf, and Pf 3), {{all at the same}} experimental conditions, indicates that the subunit helix-percentage ranges from a high of 100 % in Pf 1 to a low of 71 % in Xf. Deconvolution of amide I of Pf 3 at elevated temperatures, for which an <b>alpha-to-beta</b> transition was previously reported (Thomas, G. J., Jr., and L. A. Day, 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 78 : 2962 - 2966), allows quantitative evaluation of the contributions of both alpha-helix and beta-strand conformations to the structure of the thermally perturbed viral coat protein. Weak Raman lines of viral DNA bases and coat protein side chains, which are poorly resolved instrumentally, are also distinguished for all viruses by the deconvolution procedure. Application to the carbon- 8 hydrogen isotope exchange reaction of a purine constituent of transfer RNA permits accurate determination of the exchange rate constant, which is in agreement with calculations based upon curve-fitting methods...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{formation}} of insulin amyloidal aggregates on material surfaces {{is a well-known}} phenomenon with important pharmaceutical and medical implications. Using surface plasmon resonance imaging, we monitor insulin adsorption on model hydrophobic surfaces in real time. Insulin adsorbs in two phases: first, a very fast phase (less than 1 min), where a protein monolayer forms, followed by a slower one that can last for at least I h, where multilayered protein aggregates are present. The dissociation kinetics reveals the presence of two insulin populations that slowly interconvert: a rapidly dissociating pool and a pool of strongly bound insulin aggregates. After I h of contact between the protein solution and the surface, the adsorbed insulin has practically stopped dissociating from the surface. The con{{formation of}} adsorbed insulin is probed by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Characteristic shifts in the amide A and amide II' bands are associated with insulin adsorption. The amide I band is also distinct from that of soluble or aggregated insulin, and it slowly evolves in time. A 1708 cm(- 1) peak is observed, which characterizes insulin adsorbed for times longer than 30 min. Finally, Thioflavin T, a marker of extended beta-sheet structures present in amyloid fibers, binds to adsorbed insulin after 30 - 40 min. Altogether, these results reveal that the conformational change induced in insulin upon binding to hydrophobic surfaces allows further insulin binding from the solution. Adsorbed insulin is thus an intermediate along the <b>alpha-to-beta</b> structural transition that results {{in the formation of}} amyloidal fibers on these material surfaces.

40|$|One week of {{treatment}} with EGF and gastrin (EGF/G) {{was shown to}} restore normoglycemia and to induce islet regeneration in mice treated with the diabetogenic agent alloxan. The mechanisms underlying this regeneration are not fully understood. We performed genetic lineage tracing experiments to evaluate the contribution of beta cell neogenesis in this model. One day after alloxan administration, mice received EGF/G treatment for one week. The treatment could not prevent the initial alloxan-induced beta cell mass destruction, however it did reverse glycemia to control levels within one day, suggesting improved peripheral glucose uptake. In vitro experiments with C 2 C 12 cell line showed that EGF could stimulate glucose uptake with an efficacy {{comparable to that of}} insulin. Subsequently, EGF/G treatment stimulated a 3 -fold increase in beta cell mass, which was partially driven by neogenesis and beta cell proliferation as assessed by beta cell lineage tracing and BrdU-labeling experiments, respectively. Acinar cell lineage tracing failed to show an important contribution of acinar cells to the newly formed beta cells. No appearance of transitional cells co-expressing insulin and glucagon, a hallmark for <b>alpha-to-beta</b> cell conversion, was found, suggesting that alpha cells did not significantly contribute to the regeneration. An important fraction of the beta cells significantly lost insulin positivity after alloxan administration, which was restored to normal after one week of EGF/G treatment. Alloxan-only mice showed more pronounced beta cell neogenesis and proliferation, even though beta cell mass remained significantly depleted, suggesting ongoing beta cell death in that group. After one week, macrophage infiltration was significantly reduced in EGF/G-treated group compared to the alloxan-only group. Our results suggest that EGF/G-induced beta cell regeneration in alloxan-diabetic mice is driven by beta cell neogenesis, proliferation and recovery of insulin. The glucose-lowering effect of the treatment might {{play an important role in}} the regeneration process...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} the thesis concerns phase transformations and fatigue properties in the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. The need to weld the alloy for certain engine components can expose the alloy locally to non-optimum thermal cycles and it is therefore of importance to {{gain an understanding of}} the kinetics involved in the phase transformations during heating and cooling. Moreover, for the purpose of modelling and computer simulations of heat treatments and welding processes, quantitative descriptions of the transformation are necessary. One focus in this work has been to examine the feasibility of using high temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) to study the phase transformation kinetics. In addition, two components of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V produced by ring-rolling and closed die forging, respectively, showed unexpected differences in low cycle fatigue (LCF) under certain loading conditions. Quantitative metallographic studies and texture examinations were conducted in order to find possibly reasons for the observed difference in fatigue properties. The HT-XRD technique was successfully used to monitor the <b>alpha-to-beta</b> transition during heating and the beta-to-alpha transition during cooling and including the transformation kinetics during isothermal hold. From the recorded spectra the thermal expansion properties for the alpha and beta phases could be extracted up to a temperature of 1050 °C, enabling the determination of the overall thermal expansion for the alloy by using rule of mixture (ROM) calculations. Quantitative metallographic studies revealed that the closed die forged material exhibited a finer primary alpha grain size and a finer Widmanstätten platelet colony size which would be expected to provide a superior resistance to fatigue crack initiation. Observed differences in the texture of the two materials as determined by electron back-scattered diffraction might also have contributed to the difference in fatigue properties.

40|$|A {{solid-state}} bonding technique {{involving the}} use of gas pressure at elevated temperatures was investigated for the preparation of compartmented Zircaloy-clad flat-plate uranium dioxide fuel elements. These investigations involved development of methods for the surface preparation and assembly of fuel- element components for bonding, determination of optimum bonding parameters, development of barrier coatings for uranium dioxide to prevent reaction with Zircaloy, and extensive testing and evaluation of the bonded fuel elements. During {{the course of this}} work, the process was continually modified and refined in an effort {{to improve the quality of}} the bonded element and decrease the cost of fabrication. The surface-preparation studies indicated that satisfactory bonding could be obtained consistently with both machined and belt-abraded components. Belt abrasion is more economical and was used as the standard technique in the development phases of the program. Initially the elements were assembled into a stainless steel or Ti-Namel envelope which was evacuated and sealed prior to bonding. Later studies showed that the quality of bonded elements could be improved and process costs decreased by edge welding the Zircaloy components to form a gastight assembly that was then bonded without use of a protective envelope. Further cost reductions were incorporated into the process by {{the use of}} piece Zircaloy components to form the picture frame. Optimum bending with a minimum core-to-cladding reaction was achieved by pressure bonding at 1500 to 1550 deg F for 4 hr using a helium gas pressure of 10, 000 psi. A postbonding heat treatment for 5 min at 1850 deg F in a salt bath promoted additional grain growth at the bond interface during the <b>alpha-to-beta</b> transformation. Barrier layers of graphite. chronaium, iron. molybdenum, nickel, niobium, palladium, and various oxides were investigated to prevent reaction between the UO/sub 2 / core and Zircaloy cladding. Graphite, in the form of a sprayed and buffed coating, and chromium were found to be relatively effective barriers. The graphite coating was easy to apply and less expensive than a chromium electroplate. (auth...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the nature of determinants of equity returns {{as suggested by the}} CAPM model, in particular, alphas, betas and equity premium and to outline implications for investment managers that statistical and structural analysis of the aforementioned variables may suggest. The thesis contributes to the existing literature in the following areas. First, it addresses the question of predictive power of historical risk-adjusted portfolio performance measures on determining future equity returns in short and long term hoirsons. Second, it investigates the stability of beta coefficients and its impact on portfolio risk and seasonality in equity returns. Third, it assesses the question of dividend yield as determinant of portfolio alphas. Finally, it addresses the question of a common factor that may be influencing movements of equity premiums across European markets. All the aforementioned empirical work is the first of this kind, at least to our knowledge, in the UK. In Chapter One we provide an indirect test of alpha stability. We test if past alphas, information ratio and <b>alpha-to-beta</b> ratio of positive and negative alpha portfolios can be used to determine future portfolio returns. We find that chosen portfolio performance measures do not have any predictive power in the short term investment horisons. However, in the longer term horisons of 24 to 36 months, we document the mean reversion in our portfolio returns and conclude that one can use historical measures of performance to predict returns in the longer run. In Chapter Two we proceed to investigate if stocks with higher beta (systematic risk) also exhibit higher instability in betas as well, thus causing even greater risk for investors. We also examine the seasonality effect in the UK size-based portfolios and try to relate it to seasonality in betas. Our findings suggest that higher beta stocks do have more time-variant betas. Additionally, we find that equity returns are much higher in December-April than in May-November period but we find no robust evidence that such seasonality in returns is due to seasonality in betas but rather due to investors' psychology. In Chapter Three, we assess the relationship between excess returns and dividend yields in the UK market. The econometric analysis reveals U-shaped yield-return relationship in the 1980 s and quadratic, bell-shaped, relationship in the 1990 s. It seems that such a change in the relationship is driven by the change in the returns pattern of small size stocks in the 1990 s. We find no evidence of the tax effect as the explanation of yield-return relationship that we observe. In Chapter Four we try to identify what may be the common determinant of equity risk premium across European markets. We test for the serial correlation in the stock market returns and the results suggest that serial correlation is not in the level of returns but in the volatility of returns. Hence, if shocks to returns and in turn equity premium are persistent, there can be a scenario of a world-wide shock, which may influence the equity premium across countries in the similar manner driving them in the same direction. The overall findings of the thesis are indicating instability of CAPM determinants of UK equity returns. If investors are aware of these instabilities, they can adjust theirinvestment strategies accordingly and generate excess returns on their investmen...|$|E
