5|$|According to the Gallup Organization, Obama {{began his}} {{presidency}} with a 68% <b>approval</b> rating before gradually declining {{for the rest}} of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in August 2010, a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office. He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his <b>approval</b> numbers dropped back to where they were previously. His <b>approval</b> ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job <b>approval</b> of 52% shortly after his second inauguration. Despite <b>approval</b> ratings dropping to 39% in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50% in January 2015 according to Gallup.|$|E

Truman, the other presidents whose final Gallup ratings measured in the low 30s (Richard Nixon's final Gallup <b>approval</b> rating was even lower, at 24percent). According to a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted January 11–15, 2009, Bush's final <b>approval</b> rating in office was 22percent, the lowest in American history.|$|E

5|$|Before {{his death}} in 1107, Richard the abbot of Ely had {{attempted}} to secure from the papacy the elevation of his abbey into a bishopric. After Richard's death, Hervey was appointed to oversee the abbey during the vacancy. He convinced the monks of Ely to support Richard's project, which received the conditional <b>approval</b> of Archbishop Anselm, contingent on papal <b>approval.</b> Paschal signalled his <b>approval,</b> and in 1109 the monastery became a bishopric. Ely still remained a monastic house, as the abbey itself became the cathedral and the monks of the abbey became the monks of the cathedral chapter. Also in 1109, the pope approved Hervey's translation to a new see, and he was made Bishop of Ely. He was enthroned at Ely in October 1109.|$|E

5|$|However, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board {{withheld}} its permit <b>approval</b> in December 2000, over {{concerns that}} the Sweetwater Reservoir could be polluted in the process. Such an <b>approval</b> was necessary under the Clean Water Act {{in order to get}} the necessary <b>approval</b> from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The suit by Preserve South Bay was dismissed in March 2001, on the grounds that the legislature did not need to review the annexation of state parkland for the highway because it was done under eminent domain. In April, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board approved the project on several conditions, including monitoring the water quality to ensure that the Sweetwater Reservoir would remain a clean water source for local residents. An appeal to the state Water Resources Control Board to overturn the <b>approval</b> was unsuccessful. In July, the USACE approved the wetlands permit for the southern portion of SR 125.|$|E
