6000|$|It is {{a matter}} worthy of {{consideration}} that the accounts of similar phenomena of culture, recurring {{in different parts of}} the world, actually supply incidental proof of their own authenticity. Some years since a question which brings out this point was put to me by a great historian, [...] "How can a statement as to customs, myths, beliefs, etc., of a savage tribe be treated as evidence where it depends on the testimony of some traveller or missionary who may be a superficial observer, more or less ignorant of the native language, a careless retailer of unsifted talk, a man prejudiced, or even wilfully deceitful?" [...] This question is, indeed, one which every ethnographer ought to keep clearly and constantly before his mind. Of course he is bound to use his best judgment as to the trustworthiness of all authors he quotes, and if possible to obtain several accounts to certify each point in each locality. But it is over and above these measures of precaution that the test of recurrence comes in. If two independent visitors to different countries, say a mediaeval Mohammedan in Tartary and a modern Englishman in Dahomey, or a Jesuit missionary in Brazil and a Wesleyan in the Fiji Islands, agree in describing some <b>analogous</b> <b>art,</b> or rite, or myth among the people they have visited, it becomes difficult or impossible to set down such correspondence to accident or wilful fraud. A story by a bushranger in Australia may perhaps be objected to as a mistake or an invention; but did a Methodist minister in Guinea conspire with him to cheat the public by telling the same story there? The possibility of intentional or unintentional mystification is often barred by such a state of things as that a similar statement is made in two remote lands by two witnesses, of whom A lived a century before B, and B appears never to have heard of A. How distant are the countries, how wide apart the dates, how different the creeds and characters of the observers in the catalogue of facts of civilisation, needs no farther showing to any one who will even glance at the footnotes of the present work. And the more odd the statement, the less likely that several people in several places should have made it wrongly. This being so, it seems reasonable to judge that the statements are in the main truly given, and that their close and regular coincidence is due to the cropping up of similar facts in various districts of culture. Now the most important facts of ethnography are vouched for in this way. Experience leads the student after a while to expect and find that the phenomena of culture, as resulting from widely-acting similar causes, should recur again and again in the world. He even mistrusts isolated statements to which he knows of no parallel elsewhere, and waits for their genuineness to be shown by corresponding accounts from the other side of the earth or the other end of history. So strong indeed is the means of authentication, that the ethnographer in his library may sometimes presume to decide not only whether a particular explorer is a shrewd and honest observer, but also whether what he reports is conformable to the general rules of civilisation.

The project produced a final report, collage assessment instrument, and a user's guide.

40|$|This Article {{contends that}} part of the problem of Internet {{business}} model patents is the narrow view of <b>analogous</b> <b>art</b> employed by judges and USPTO examiners which largely excludes relevant 2 ̆ 2 real-world 2 ̆ 2 prior art in the determination of non-obviousness under § 103 of the Patent Act. Consequently, part of the solution lies in helping courts and the USPTO properly to define <b>analogous</b> <b>art</b> for a particular invention. To do so, judges and examiners must recognize the interchangeability of computer programming (i. e. 2 ̆ 2 e-world 2 ̆ 2 activities) to perform a function, with human or mechanical performance of the same function (i. e. 2 ̆ 2 real world 2 ̆ 2 activities). Such recognition is consistent with binding United States Supreme Court precedent and requires a reversal of the trend towards narrow <b>analogous</b> <b>art</b> definitions in the obviousness inquiry. This Article also identifies an increased potential for abuse of the doctrine of equivalents in the Internet business model context due to a combination of factors that impact the usefulness of traditional controls on the application of the doctrine of equivalents. Such factors include a dearth of properly trained business method USPTO examiners, and a lack of business method and software prior art readily available to examiners to consult in assessing the patentability of such methods. To the extent such factors result in Internet business model patents with the scope, by default, of 2 ̆ 2 pioneer 2 ̆ 2 patents, limitations on application of the doctrine of equivalents are necessary. To lay the groundwork for this dual analysis, Part I of this Article provides a look at Internet business model patents in light of key patentability requirements mandated by the Patent Act. Part II traces the evolution of the <b>analogous</b> <b>art</b> component of the non-obviousness determination and illustrates how the malleability of the doctrine, as exemplified in several Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decisions, has particular relevance to prior art definitions for Internet business model patents. Part III of this Article then examines the doctrine of equivalents and explores how the likelihood of improper application of this doctrine in the Internet business model context is increased. Recognizing that feasible solutions are not limited to doctrinal remedies, this Article also mentions other, more drastic ways of addressing the Internet business model conundrum. It concludes, however, that rational exercise of the elasticity present in both the doctrine of <b>analogous</b> <b>art</b> and the doctrine of equivalents provides a better approach to defining proper Internet business model claim scope...|$|E
40|$|Since 1952, {{the patent}} statute has {{forbidden}} courts from discriminating against, or “negativing,” inventions {{according to how}} they were made, be it “long toil and experimentation” or a “flash of genius. ” Now, in addressing whether an invention is “obvious,” courts must only examine whether the invention was obvious according to the arts pertinent to that invention — the “analogous” rather than “nonanalogous” arts. This article shows that this dichotomy has actually promoted method-of-invention discrimination in patent law because the subjectivity of the <b>analogous</b> <b>art</b> inquiry has increasingly “analogized” wide fields of prior art as technology has progressed. This, in turn, {{has the effect of}} “negativing” inventions made by “long toil and experimentation” relative to “flash of genius” inventions because the latter are more capable of drawing upon disparate arts less susceptible to analogizing. This article further examines the consequences of this effect as “negativing” the underlying policy justifications for the patent monopoly and concludes by calling for a more cabined approach to the <b>analogous</b> <b>art</b> inquiry...|$|E

5000|$|The {{question}} of how to understand Aristotle's conception of nature having a purpose and direction something like human activity is controversial in the details. Martha Nussbaum for example has argued that in his biology this approach was practical and meant to show nature only being <b>analogous</b> to human <b>art,</b> explanations of an organ being greatly informed by knowledge of its essential function. Nevertheless, Nussbaum's position is not universally accepted. In any case, Aristotle was not understood this way by his followers in the Middle Ages, who saw him as consistent with monotheistic religion and a teleological understanding of all nature. Consistent with the medieval interpretation, in his Metaphysics and other works Aristotle clearly argued a case for their being one highest god or [...] "prime mover" [...] which was the ultimate cause, though specifically not the material cause, of the eternal forms or natures which cause the natural order, including all living things. And he clearly refers to this entity having an intellect that humans somehow share in, which helps humans see the true natures or forms of things without relying purely on sense perception of physical things, including living species. This understanding of nature, and Aristotle's arguments against materialist understandings of nature, were very influential in the Middle Ages in Europe. The idea of fixed species remained dominant in biology until Darwin, and a focus upon biology is still common today in teleological criticisms of modern science.|$|R
40|$|The author {{examines}} {{whether and}} by {{which means the}} decisions handed down by the State judge giving his support to the arbitral proceeding (juge d'appui) may be appealed. Every relevant Article in the PILA (Private International Law Act) is addressed and analyzed in this regard (Art. 179 (2) and (3), Art. 180 (3), Art. 183 (2), Art. 184 (3) and Art. 185) by reference to the present legal doctrine and case law. Concerning the stages of appeal, the view is held that by direct or <b>analogous</b> application of <b>Art.</b> 356 (2) CPC (Civil Procedure Code) the juge d'appui has jurisdiction as the sole instance of the Canton to render decisions {{in support of the}} arbitral tribunal. On the federal level however, the parties shall have the right to appeal against these decisions by filing a civil law appeal before the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, with the exception of most decisions given by juge d'appui within the meaning of Art. 180 (3) PILA. As to this federal appeal, it is established that the case law of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court under the FTA (Act on the Federal Tribunal) indicates the Court's inclination to qualify both negative and positive decisions issued by the juge d'appui as final decisions in terms of Art. 90 FTA. In reference to the upcoming revision of the PILA's 12 th Chapter the author concludes that the legislator might implement some clarifications in the current legal framework.

40|$|The Polish Act on Private International Law {{does not}} contain {{provisions}} on proper law for contracts for the transfer of technology. In the legal writings three proposals to eliminate the existing axiological lacuna have been set forth. According to the first view, if the parties did not choose the proper law, patent licences should be governed by the law proper for {{the seat of the}} exporter of technology at the moment of concluding the contract (Art. 27 § 1 sec. 1 of the Act of 1975 on Private International Law). The above solution is based on „analogiae legis" and assumes the similarity between patent licences and the contract of sale. According to the second view, {{in the absence of the}} detailed statutory regulation of the issue in question, Art. 29 of the Act, providing for the subsidiary connecting factor of the place of contract (lex loci actus), should be applied. The third view is based on the assumption that patent licences should be governed by <b>analogous</b> application of <b>Art.</b> 27 § 1 sec. 4 of the Act stipulating that for contracts for acquisition of copyrights the proper law is the law of the importer. The author declares for the latter solution. His reasoning is based on the analysis of the socio-economic function of licence contracts. Both in copyright lawas well as in patent law, the establishment of the right to exploit an invention (the author's work) is ussually based on long-term contracts, the performance of the acquirer (licensee) is of continuous character and must be fulfilled on the licence territory. Moreover, the interest of the country which is the recipient of technology prevails over the interest of the country which exports it. While the latter is interested in obtaining proceeds from the licence fees, the former sets on the licence its hopes of developing its own economy. Besides, the recipient takes much greater risk of the transaction. The importation of technology is connected with concurrent investments, the ecological risk, etc. Moreover, subjecting the licence contract to the law in force on the licence territory is the only way to prevent the conflict between „lex loci protections" and the law proper for the contractual status. In case the licence encompasses several countries, the author suggests the competence of the law of domicile of the licensee, provided that his domicile is on the territory of the country being the center of the economical exploitation of an invention. The second part of the article is concerned with an attempt to distinguish between the contractual status of the licence contract and the patent status (lex loci protectionis). The author defends the opinion that the admissibility of granting a licence and the dispositional consequences of a legal transaction come under lex loci protectionis.

40|$|Although the GATT is emblematic among {{multilateral}} agreements in pursuing {{the removal of}} trade restrictions, it includes {{a considerable number of}} exceptions that allow the WTO Members to impose new ones. Art. XXVIII permits the WTO Members, upon negotiations with specified categories of other Members, to withdraw or increase the binding tariff rates on certain products listed in their Schedules of concessions. As these new arrangements are conducted outside a Round of multilateral negotiations, which is the traditional context for reciprocation of tariff concessions, they are called “renegotiations”. Art. XXVIII is thus prominent among the GATT exceptions, since it is designed to counteract what is considered as the core of the GATT obligations, notably the commitment under Art. II not to increase tariffs listed in the Schedules of concessions. GATS <b>Art.</b> XXI is <b>analogous</b> to <b>Art.</b> XXVIII, though it differs from the GATT provision in some procedural respects. Clearly enough, the rationale underlying Art. XXVIII is to provide the WTO Members with some flexibility in their liberalisation commitments. Tariff concessions made in the course of multilateral Rounds might become unexpectedly burdensome after consolidation. Some mechanisms for the adjustment of tariff commitments were thus introduced in the GATT to relieve the WTO Members from import surpluses. The renegotiation procedure envisaged in Art. XXVIII is perhaps the principal of these mechanisms but not the exclusive one. The “emergency action on imports of particular products” provided for in Art. XIX and the additional tariff flexibilities to be granted to developing countries in order to protect infant industries according to Art. XVIII are other relevant examples of adjustments of tariff commitments in the interval between two Rounds of multilateral negotiations. Unlike Articles XVIII and XIX, Art. XXVIII does not require the WTO Member willing to withdraw or increase its tariff rates to produce evidence of the negative effects of the existent rates on its domestic market. Art. XXVIII was conceived as a tool to be used by the WTO Members in the ordinary run of multilateral trade and not under the pressure of special or emergency domestic circumstances, such as a crisis of production or the establishment of an infant industry. In order to discourage WTO Members from recurring to renegotiations routinely – an occurrence which would seriously undermine the GATT predictability –, the drafters of Art. XXVIII assigned to the major trading partners of the Member seeking modification or withdrawal with respect to the product concerned a right to compensation or, as a last resort, a right to counter-retaliate. Most of Art. XXVIII provisions are procedural. According to Art. XXIV: 6, these same procedures are to be followed by those WTO Members which raise their binding tariffs {{as a result of their}} entrance into, or implementation of, a regional trade agreement creating a customs union. The establishment of a common external tariff on certain products, which is intrinsic to the economic pattern of a customs union, is indeed likely to lead one or more of the separate customs territories forming a customs union to raise their tariffs with a view to make them uniform to the common external tariff. Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) usually do not have a provision similar to GATT Art. XXVIII, while, for example, all of them contain a safeguard clause such as the one provided in GATT Art. XIX. In general, instances of recourse to Art. XXVIII have considerably decreased in number over the years. As from 1958, renegotiations started to be predominantly conducted under Art. XXVIII: 5. The gradual shift to this modality of renegotiations is easy to understand: under this provision, the WTO Members can act with a relative freedom, since they have neither to respect the time-limit of Art. XXVIII: 1 neither to obtain the authorization prescribed by Art. XXVIII: 4. As in practice the right of retaliation has been exercised very rarely, it is to be presumed that the negotiations on compensation have been successful on average. However, there could have been other reasons which might have deterred the WTO Members from resorting to retaliations. Principally, they might have feared that third WTO Members, i. e. Members other than the Member having originally withdrawn or modified its concessions, could at their turn counter-counter-retaliate, withdrawing or modifying concessions of exporting interest for the Members having taken retaliatory actions first. Since, as illustrated above, a concession must be withdrawn or modified on a MFN basis, there is, as a result, an inherent difficulty in effectively implementing the retaliation provision of Art. XXVIII: 3...|$|R
