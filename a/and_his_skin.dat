5|$|Despite {{wanting to}} contact {{his parents in}} the United States, Owumi {{was not able to}} access the Internet or use his phone for {{international}} calls. He was also without electricity and had little food or water. Al-Nasr team president Ahmed Elturki also told Owumi that the airport in Libya had been burned down by protesters and advised him to remain in his apartment. Trapped in Mutassim's apartment during conflict, Owumi was eventually forced to drink toilet water with tea bags, urinate in the bathtub, and defecate into plastic bags. He also ate cockroaches and worms he found in the flower pots. His poor living conditions caused his teeth to rot <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> to discolor.|$|E
5|$|His {{eyes are}} open, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> is unblemished. The cross is painted with deep blue paint, perhaps evoking an eternal or {{timeless}} sky. This evocation, {{not present in}} the main crucified figure, {{was known as the}} Christus triumphans ("Triumphant Christ"), and for contemporary– especially Franciscan– taste lacked verisimilitude, as it bore little relation to the actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion, and overly distanced the divine from the human aspect of Christ. From about 1240, painters favoured the Christus patiens ("Suffering Christ") style: a saviour who shared the burden and pain of humanity. The Santa Croce Crucifix is one of the earliest and best known examples of the type.|$|E

25|$|President {{and co-founder}} of Oop!. Primarily business-minded, {{he has been a}} millionaire three times over with various (eventually failed) projects. He devotes his time to seeking venture capital for the startup company. Ethan's {{personality}} is diametrically opposed to the other characters, in part because of his relative lack of technical knowledge. He suffers from bad dandruff <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> is pocked by scars from procedures to remove cancerous growths.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 Legend Films {{released}} a colorized version of Plan 9 from Outer Space on DVD. Though the colorization process was largely done straight, unlike the campy bright colors {{used in the}} studio's release of Reefer Madness, {{there were a few}} alterations. Legend had auctioned off the opportunity to insert new material into the film through two auctions on eBay. The first allowed the auction winner to provide a photograph that is digitally inserted into part of the scene between the Ghoul Man and Paula Trent. The second allowed the winner to have his or her name placed on a gravestone during a scene with Wood regular Tor Johnson. The third alteration is at a point where Eros gets punched <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> briefly turns green.|$|E
25|$|In {{another version}} of the story, Pallas was a Gigante; Athena slew him during the Gigantomachy <b>and</b> flayed off <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> to make her cloak, which she wore as a victory trophy. In an {{alternate}} variation of the same myth, Pallas was instead Athena's father, who attempted to assault his own daughter, causing Athena to kill him <b>and</b> take <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> as a trophy.|$|R

25|$|On 22 January 2007, Šebrle {{was hurt}} by a javelin thrown by a South African female javelin thrower, Sunette Viljoen, from a {{distance}} of 55metres while training in South Africa. The javelin pierced the edge of his right shoulder from the front, 12cm deep. Shocked, Šebrle ripped the javelin out immediately, which could have caused even more damage. It did not cause any serious injury however, because it slipped between a muscle <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin.</b> He was taken to a hospital, but left soon with just eleven stitches. However, he was limited in training for some time, especially in the pole vault. Later he stated that he was only 20cm away from being killed and 1cm from an injury that would have ended his career.|$|E
500|$|The {{body was}} buried in a coffin and later {{translated}} to Beodericsworth, but Abbo failed to date either events, although from the text {{it can be seen}} that he believed that the relics had been taken to Beodericsworth by the time that Theodred became Bishop of London in around 926. Upon exhumation of the body, a miracle was discovered. All the arrow wounds upon Edmund's corpse had healed and his head was reattached. The only evidence of decapitation was a line around his neck <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> was still soft and fresh, as if he had been sleeping. [...] The last recorded inspection of the body whilst at Bury St Edmunds was in 1198.|$|E
500|$|The prison {{commander}} {{brought his}} unusual captive {{to the attention}} of The Commissioners for taking Care of Sick and Wounded Seamen and for the Care and Treatment of Prisoners of War, the body then responsible for all medical services in the Royal Navy and for overseeing the welfare of prisoners of war. , a member of the Commission, and Dr Cochrane, Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, performed an experiment to test Domery's eating capacity and tolerance for unusual foods. At 4:00am, Domery was awakened and fed 4lbs (1.8kg) of raw cow's udder, which was eaten without hesitation. At 9:30am he was given a meal of 5lbs (2.3kg) of raw beef, twelve large tallow candles totalling onepound (453g), and a bottle of porter, all of which were consumed. At 1:00pm Domery was given another meal of a further 5lbs of beef, a pound (453g) of candles, and three large bottles of porter, all of which were also eaten and drunk. During the course of the experiment he did not defecate, urinate or vomit at any point, his pulse remained regular <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> did not change temperature. Upon Domery's return to his quarters at 6:15pm following the conclusion of the experiment, he was recorded as being of [...] "particularly good cheer", and danced, smoked his pipe and drank a further bottle of porter.|$|E

500|$|Dale Keown's {{comic book}} artwork of the Hulk was an {{inspiration}} for his design. Leterrier felt the first Hulk had [...] "too much fat [...] the proportions were a little off". He explained, [...] "The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank." [...] Visual effects supervisor Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a linebacker rather than a bodybuilder. A height of nine feet was chosen for the character as {{they did not want}} him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited flushing as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions. The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an olive or even gray slate. His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for The Avengers film. The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on Mike Deodato's art. He originally had a crew cut, but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character. Leterrier cited An American Werewolf in London as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change. As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms. Leterrier changed the Abomination's design from the comics because he felt the audience would question why he resembled a fish or a reptile, instead of [...] "an über-human" [...] like the Hulk. Rather, his hideousness is derived from being injected multiple times into his skin, muscles and bones; creating a creature with a protruding spine and sharp bones that he can use to stab. His green skin is pale, and reflects light, so it appears orange because of surrounding fire during the climactic battle. The motion capture performers, including Roth, tried to make the character behave less gracefully than the Hulk. They modeled his posture and the way he turns his head on a shark. The character also shares Roth's tattoos. A height of eleven feet was chosen for the character. Leterrier tried to work in the character's pointed ears, but realized the Hulk would bite them off (using the example of Mike Tyson when he fought Evander Holyfield), and felt ignoring that would make the Hulk come across as stupid.|$|E
60|$|The Chief Inspector {{felt as if}} the {{air between}} his {{clothing}} <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> had become unpleasantly hot. It was the sensation of an unprecedented and incredible experience.|$|E
