5|$|He {{began playing}} {{football}} at Centre in 1917, making <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> {{as a freshman}} when his 17-yard drop kick defeated the rival Kentucky Wildcats 3–0 (his only field goal).

5|$|In 1980, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} consisting of Nobel Prize–winning physicist Luis Alvarez, his son geologist Walter Alvarez, and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Michel discovered that sedimentary layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary contain a concentration of iridium many times greater than normal (30, 160, and 20 times in three sections originally studied). Iridium is extremely rare in Earth's crust because it is a siderophile element, and therefore, most of it traveled with the iron as it sank into Earth's core during planetary differentiation. As iridium remains abundant in most asteroids and comets, the Alvarez team suggested that an asteroid struck the Earth {{at the time of the}} K–Pg boundary. There were earlier speculations on the possibility of <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> event, but this was the first hard evidence of <b>an</b> <b>impact.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{occurrence}} of multiple supernumerary teeth in individuals without any associated syndrome is rare. In this report, a rare {{case of a}} 48 -year-old woman who had <b>an</b> <b>impacted</b> supernumerary fourth molar in the bilateral mandibular ramus is described. She presented with a swelling in the left cheek region. Radiographic examination revealed <b>an</b> <b>impacted</b> supernumerary tooth in the left mandibular ramus with pericoronal resorption of the bone, suggesting peripheral inflammation. She also had <b>an</b> <b>impacted</b> supernumerary tooth on the right side. After administering an antibiotic and antiinflammatory drug, tooth extraction was performed under general anesthesia...|$|R

5|$|A 1997 {{survey of}} early astronomical records and {{drawings}} {{suggested that a}} certain dark surface feature discovered by astronomer Giovanni Cassini in 1690 may have been <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> scar.

5|$|A {{few days}} after the murders, the Ministry of Interior {{announced}} its deliberation about making the gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists in order to give them the ability to report to police possible changes of mental state of their patients having <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> on their eligibility to possess firearms. This was, however, rejected by psychiatric associations. They argued that psychiatrists' main goal is to cure patients, and that potential patients {{may be more likely to}} avoid psychiatric treatment for fear of losing their gun license.|$|E
5|$|A gull colony {{has been}} present since 1984, {{although}} gulls were seen briefly {{on the shores}} of the new island only weeks after it first appeared. The gull colony has been particularly important in developing the plant life on Surtsey, and the gulls have had much more of <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> on plant colonisation than other breeding species due to their abundance.

5|$|A third {{possibility}} is {{the involvement of}} a third body or a type of impact disruption. More-recent lines of evidence for Phobos having a highly porous interior, and suggesting a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates and other minerals known from Mars, point toward an origin of Phobos from material ejected by <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit, similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon. Although the VNIR spectra of the moons of Mars resemble those of outer-belt asteroids, the thermal infrared spectra of Phobos are reported to be inconsistent with chondrites of any class.|$|E
5|$|About 20 large (40–150m across) ejecta blocks {{have been}} identified, {{embedded}} in Ida's regolith. Ejecta blocks constitute the largest {{pieces of the}} regolith. Because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events, those present on the surface must have been either formed recently or uncovered by <b>an</b> <b>impact</b> event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, {{but they may not}} have been produced there. This area attracts debris due to Ida's irregular gravitational field. Some blocks may have been ejected from the young crater Azzurra {{on the opposite side of}} the asteroid.|$|E
