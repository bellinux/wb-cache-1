40|$|Stimulated by {{the report}} of high-yield, {{low-temperature}} catalytic conversion of methane to methyl bisulfate (Periana et al., Science 1998, 280, 560), we studied the relative stability and reaction mechanism of the Pt(NH_ 3) _ 2 Cl_ 2 and Pt(bpym) Cl_ 2 complexes in concentrated sulfuric acid. We find that the mechanism involves {{a series of steps}} beginning with C−H activation to form an intermediate ion-pair Pt(II) −CH_ 4 methane complex prior to forming a Pt(II) −CH_ 3 complex. Our calculated relative activation barriers for C−H activation are in good agreement with experimentally observed H/D ratios. Subsequent oxidation to a Pt(IV) complex can occur with reduction of SO_ 3. Release of methyl bisulfate regenerates the Pt(II) catalyst. Our calculations indicate that for the bipyrimidine system C−H activation prefers electrophilic substitution, whereas for the ammine system oxidation addition is more favorable. We find that the oxidation step (the rate-determining step) is more favorable for the ammine catalyst, suggesting higher activity than the bipyrimidine catalyst. However, we find that in sulfuric acid the <b>ammine</b> <b>complex</b> is unstable, while the bipyrimidine catalyst is stable. Bipyrimidine acts as a “proton sink”, allowing the protonated form of the ligand to remain bound to Pt in concentrated sulfuric acid.
