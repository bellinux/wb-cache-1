Internationals are appointed with launch VE Calais V alloy wheels, front foglamps, a six-disc CD changer, leather upholstered trim <b>and</b> <b>steering</b> wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist. Holden reintroduced the International in October 2009. Offered in sedan and Sportwagon body styles, the second iteration was fitted with the 3.0-litre SIDI V6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission; a 3.6-litre LPG Alloytec V6 engine with four-speed automatic transmission option {{was available for}} the sedan only. Extra features include 18-inch alloy wheels, Berlina front grille, leather seat trim <b>and</b> <b>steering</b> wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist for the sedan (already standard on Sportwagons).|$|E

5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning <b>and</b> <b>steering,</b> the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E
5|$|An area of squally {{weather was}} first noted {{a few hundred}} miles east of the Lesser Antilles on September 18. The {{convective}} area organized into a tropical depression near the north coast of Hispaniola on September 20. After moving west-northwestward for a day, it turned northeastward, where upper level winds were very favorable <b>and</b> <b>steering</b> currents were very weak. On September 22 Gracie was named as a tropical depression before it developed into Tropical Storm Gracie, followed by reaching hurricane strength later that night. It turned to the east on September 25, and turned back west to west-northwest on September 27 as a stable anticyclone built in to its north.|$|E
5|$|An {{introduction}} to the series is the Pilot Assist feature. Intended for players new to the series, it is a passive auto-piloting feature that assists players by nudging {{them away from the}} edges of the track or from walls, though its effects at higher speed settings are less desirable. Wipeout HD allows players to control their craft by using the motion-sensitive features of the PlayStation's Sixaxis controller. Motion control comes in two variants: pitch <b>and</b> <b>steering,</b> or pitch only. The former allows the craft to be totally controlled by moving the controller, while the latter only allows the nose of the craft to be raised or lowered by motion control, with the steering either controlled by analogue stick or D-pad.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} trail a {{particular}} bike has may vary with time for several reasons. On bikes with front suspension, especially telescopic forks, compressing the front suspension, due to heavy braking for example, can steepen the steering axis angle and reduce trail. Trail also varies with lean angle, <b>and</b> <b>steering</b> angle, usually decreasing from a maximum when the bike is straight upright and steered straight ahead. Trail can decrease to zero with sufficiently large lean and steer angles, which can alter how stable a bike feels. Finally, even {{the profile of}} the front tire can influence how trail varies as the bike is leaned and steered.|$|E
5|$|Upon U-1s completion, the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{conducted}} {{trials of}} the submarine throughout most of 1910. On 5 April both of U-1s electric motors were damaged in a flooding incident during her trials. U-1s gasoline engines {{were never able to}} meet the speed called for in the contract during the Navy evaluations, and were considered not suitable for wartime use. As a result, the Navy only paid for U-1s hull and armament, and arranged a lease of the gasoline engines while replacement diesel engines were ordered from the Austrian firm Maschinenfabrik Leobersdorf.

5|$|Admiral Scheer sailed in October 1940 on {{her first}} combat sortie. On the night of 31 October she slipped through the Denmark Strait and broke into the open Atlantic. Her B-Dienst radio {{intercept}} equipment identified the convoy HX-84, sailing from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Admiral Scheers Arado seaplanes located the convoy on 5 November 1940, The armed merchant cruiser , the sole escort for the convoy, issued {{a report of the}} German raider and attempted to prevent her from attacking the convoy. The convoy was ordered to scatter under cover of a smoke screen. Admiral Scheers first salvo scored hits on Jervis Bay, disabling her wireless equipment <b>and</b> <b>steering</b> gear. Shells from her second salvo struck the bridge and killed her commander, Edward Fegen VC. Admiral Scheer quickly sank Jervis Bay, but the delay allowed the majority of the convoy to escape. The Admiral Scheer sank only five of the convoy's 37 ships, though a sixth was sunk by the Luftwaffe following the convoy's dispersal.|$|E
5|$|During the VB's development, Holden {{realised}} {{that when}} driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall. This forced Holden {{to rework the}} entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent commonality with the Opel. The Rekord's MacPherson strut front suspension was accordingly modified, and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a rack and pinion type. These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported â€”a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure <b>and</b> <b>steering</b> rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year. In face of these issues, VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication, especially in regards to the steering, ride quality, handling and brakes, thus securing the Wheels Car of the Year award for 1978.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{introduce}} {{a new type of}} electric power steering system, the structure and working principle of the system were introduced, and the models of the car, the tire <b>and</b> the <b>steering</b> system were established. The assist characteristic of the power <b>steering</b> <b>and</b> the ideal <b>steering</b> ratio were also designed and optimized. At last, the simulation tests were carried out. The double planetary wheel mechanism is the most important component of the system. With this mechanism, the system synthesizes the force or motion from the <b>steering</b> wheel <b>and</b> the motor. So the power <b>steering</b> <b>and</b> a small <b>steering</b> ratio can be provided at a low speed, <b>and</b> the <b>steering</b> ratio can be changed initiatively at a medium or high speed. Whatâ€™s more, the steering ability still exists when there is a fault in the system. The simulation results show this steering system can effectively improve the steering portability, low-speed sensitivity, and the vehicle handling stability...|$|R
