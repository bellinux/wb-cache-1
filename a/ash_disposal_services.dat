40|$|A phytosociological {{study was}} {{conducted}} as an initial assessment of the vegetation on <b>ash</b> <b>disposal</b> sites {{to determine the community}} structure of vegetation and how the communities were related based on their species composition and habitat characteristics. The Braun-Blanquet survey and data analysis method was used to identify and classify plant communities on <b>ash</b> <b>disposal</b> sites and an adjacent natural grassland. Relevés were compiled in 113 survey plots. The TWINSPAN classification algorithm was used as first approximation and results were subsequently refined using Braun-Blanquet procedures. The DCA ordination technique was also used to determine the relationship between communities and whether gradients exist in the study area, α-diversity between communities are statistically compared using the Shannon diversity indices and species richness. The natural grassland sites, rehabilitated <b>ash</b> <b>disposal</b> sites and unrehabilitated <b>ash</b> <b>disposal</b> sites formed three separate communities. The two sub-communities that are described on rehabilitated <b>ash</b> <b>disposal</b> sites are distinguished mainly with respect to age of rehabilitation and level of disturbance. Community structure, on a variant level, is largely determined by different treatments (seed mixtures and soil preparations) that were used in the rehabilitation of the <b>ash</b> <b>disposal</b> sites. Plant communities on recently rehabilitated sites are similar to plant communities on dumps of domestic refuse on some of the disposal sites. Based on the variants described, three homogenous areas on the old rehabilitated sites, which were rehabilitated more than three years ago, can be identified. Vegetation is relatively homogenous and variants are closely related. Differences in rehabilitation treatment, age of rehabilitation and man-made disturbances were some of the important factors determining the establishment of different communities on <b>ash</b> <b>disposal</b> sites. Statistically significant differences are found in the diversity of vegetation studied on a community and variant level. Associations on the <b>ash</b> <b>disposal</b> areas are strongly based on the dominance of particular species rather than specific indicator species...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} component of any ecosystem is the species it contains. Species also serves as good indicators of the ecological condition of a system. A list of all species collected during the three-year period was therefore compiled together with their life form spectra. The floristic composition of the <b>ash</b> <b>disposal</b> area at Hendrina Power Station was also compared with the floristic composition of an adjacent natural grassland. A total of 278 species were identified of which 151 occurred on the <b>ash</b> <b>disposal</b> sites and 163 in the natural grassland. Of all the species, 35 occurred in both areas of which most were annual pioneer species. The species composition and life form spectra of the two areas were considerably different. Therophytes were, for example, more abundant on the <b>ash</b> <b>disposal</b> areas. The reconstruction of an ecosystem on <b>ash</b> <b>disposal</b> sites with a species composition {{similar to that of}} the natural grassland will require far more financial inputs and habitat amelioration than is presently the situation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this paper, we empirically {{examine the}} {{effectiveness}} of existed several economic instruments in 31 provinces in China and develop the ways that could control the industrial pollution effectively. Although the current pollution norms and the informal pressure {{have a positive effect}} on controlling the water pollution in China, there are still some tasks we are supposed to do to improve the water quality. In this paper, the author suggests testing the monitoring and enforcement efforts of city wastewater pollution control authorities, which are affected by local community characteristics that act as proxies for political power. We utilize the dataset of plant-level annual emission data from 31 provinces in China to serve the model environmental pollution equilibrium. Use demand for residual <b>disposal</b> <b>service</b> and supply of residual <b>disposal</b> <b>service</b> to test the efficiency of the community on government monitoring enforcement. And also it indicates the regulations; formal and informal have positive effects on pollution abatement. Develop the integrated ways that puts more emphasis on the combination of control and command approaches, market-based approaches and the informal regulation with the cooperation of government, communities and the polluters.

5000|$|Slurry {{transport}} uses several methods: hydraulic conveying; conventional lean slurry conveying; {{and high}} concentration slurry disposal (HCSD). The latter, HCSD, {{is a relatively}} modern approach, {{which is used to}} transfer high throughputs of fine fly ash over long distances (>10 km) using high pressure diaphragm pumps with velocities of around 2 m/s. <b>Ash</b> <b>disposal</b> is simple as the ash solidifies easily and the system does not produce the waste water or leachate problems which can often be associated with ash lagoons.|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{resources}} supply waste <b>disposal</b> <b>services</b> {{that are}} {{demanded by the}} industry. If the property right for the environmental resources is with the public or with the government, the supply of waste <b>disposal</b> <b>services</b> depends upon the assimilative capacity of environmental media and the damages the public receives from the pollution. If the industry has {{to comply with the}} environmental regulation, the demand for the waste <b>disposal</b> <b>services</b> by the industry depends upon the cost of pollution abatement. Marginal damages to the public from pollution and the marginal cost of pollution abatement to the industry could be regarded as the supply and demand prices for the environmental services. Pollution tax is nothing but the price of waste <b>disposal</b> <b>services</b> with respect to which supply is equal to demand. If the environmental standards are fixed depending upon the assimilative capacity of environmental media, the supply of environmental services is fixed and the tax or price then entirely depends on the demand. Since the standards are normally given for a vector of pollutants as it is the case of MINAS standards in India, there will be pollutant specific taxes. A method of estimating polluting specific taxes is described in this paper. The estimates of pollutant specific taxes for controlling water pollution from industries in India are obtained for BOD, COD and SS. ...|$|R

The choice of container size is not affected by the price of waste <b>disposal</b> <b>services,</b> but within a given container size, households respond to a price increase by increasing recycling to avoid charges for waste generation above contracted volumes. ...|$|R
40|$|Use of coal ash as {{structural}} fill {{to support}} footings in low-lying areas {{can be a}} cost-effective solution to <b>ash</b> <b>disposal</b> problems. In some applications, especially when footings are constructed near {{the crest of the}} ash fill slope, this <b>ash</b> <b>disposal</b> solution may not meet the foundation requirements due to poor load-bearing capacity. Inclusion of horizontal geosynthetic reinforcements within the fill {{may be one of the}} most viable solutions in improving the loadbearing capacity of coal ash slope. Most information available in the literature for reinforced soil slope is based on small-scale laboratory model tests but field tests on prototype foundations give more realistic results. In view of the difficulties in accurately modeling full-scale behavior with small-scale laboratory models, practitioner generally does not adopt this result in the field. Therefore in the present investigation, large-scale model footing tests on reinforced coal ash slope were conducted in the laboratory. Prototype geogrid was used as reinforcement. The variables were number of reinforcement and edge distance of footing from the slope crest. The aim of this investigation was to find out the efficacy of multi-layer reinforcements in improving the load-bearing capacity of coal ash slope. The results were found to be encouraging and may have practical applications...|$|R
