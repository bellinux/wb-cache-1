40|$|The 119 -amino acid residue prolyl cis/trans {{isomerase}} from Arabidopsis thaliana (PIN 1 At) {{is similar}} to the catalytic domain of the human hPIN 1. However, PIN 1 At lacks the N-terminal WW domain that appears to be essential for the hPIN 1 function. Here, the solution structure of PIN 1 At was determined by three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The PIN 1 At fold could be superimposed on that of the catalytic domain of hPIN 1 and had a 19 residue flexible loop located between strand beta 1 and helix alpha 1. The dynamical features of this beta 1 /alpha 1 -loop, which are characteristic for a region involved in protein-protein interactions, led to exchange broadening in the NMR spectra. When sodium sulfate salt was added to the protein sample, the beta 1 /alpha 1 loop was stabilized and, hence, a complete backbone resonance assignment was obtained. Previously, with a phospho-Cdc 25 peptide as substrate, PIN 1 At had been shown to catalyze the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine prolyl cis/trans isomerization specifically. To map the catalytic site of PIN 1 At, the phospho-Cdc 25 peptide or sodium sulfate salt was added in excess to the protein and chemical shift changes in the backbone amide protons were monitored in the (1) H(N) -(15) N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectrum. The peptide caused perturbations in the loops between helix alpha 4 and strand beta 3, between strands beta 3 and beta 4, in the alpha 3 helix, and in the beta 1 /alpha 1 loop. The amide groups of the residues Arg 21 and Arg 22 showed large chemical shift perturbations upon phospho-Cdc 25 peptide or sulfate addition. We conclude that this basic cluster formed by Arg 21 and Arg 22, both located in the beta 1 /alpha 1 loop, is homologous to that found in the hPIN 1 crystal structure (Arg 68 and Arg 69), which also is involved in sulfate ion binding. We showed that the sulfate group competed for the interaction between PIN 1 At and the phospho-Cdc 25 peptide. In the absence of the WW domain, three hydrophobic residues (Ile 33, Ile 34, and Leu 35) located in the long flexible loop and specific for the plant PIN-type peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases) could be an additional interaction site in PIN 1 At. However, phospho-peptide addition did not affect the resonances of these residues significantly. Electrostatic potential calculations revealed a negatively charged <b>area</b> <b>not</b> <b>found</b> in hPIN 1 on the PIN 1 At molecular surface, which corresponds to the surface shielded by the WW domain in hPIN 1. Based on our experimental results and the molecular specificities of the PIN 1 At enzyme, functional implications of the lack of WW domains in this plant PIN-type PPIase will be discussed.
