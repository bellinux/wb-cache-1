40|$|Surface topography, surface {{residual}} stress and bending strength of RBSiC ground using diamond wheel were studied. Grinding RBSiC is removed mainly by brittle fracture and lightly by ductile cutting. With {{the increase of}} <b>down</b> <b>feed,</b> surface roughness Ra increases. Burnishing with no <b>down</b> <b>feed</b> can improve the Ra in some way. With increasing <b>down</b> <b>feed,</b> the compressive {{residual stress}} decreases because of an inadequately cooling effect. Compare with the specimens grounded using 0. 9 μm/s, those using <b>down</b> <b>feed</b> of 1. 35 μm/s have worse surface quality. Considering both the processing efficiency and the surface quality, the optimum parameters are as follow: 0. 9 μm/s <b>down</b> <b>feed,</b> 2. 1 r/min work table rotational speed and 1 min burnishing...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{observations}} for {{the performance}} of a jet pump are presented with two different suction configurations and designs. The experimental rig was constructed in such a way it can be used with up feed (negative suction head) or <b>down</b> <b>feed</b> (positive suction head). During experimental programme water is used in both motive and pumped sides. The effect of nozzle-to-throat spacing to nozzle diameter ratio “X”, on the jet pump performance was also tested, with different flow rates and motive pressures, in both cases (up <b>feed</b> and <b>down</b> <b>feed).</b> It was found that the best efficiency for the jet pump is attained with the up feeding configuration.

50|$|In the NFL and the Canadian Football League {{the penalty}} for {{defensive}} pass interference is an <b>automatic</b> first <b>down</b> at the spot of the foul. If the foul occurs in the end zone, the ball will be placed at the one-yard line (or half {{the distance to the}} goal if the line of scrimmage was already inside the 1 yard line). In U.S. college football and amateur Canadian football, the penalty is to the spot of the foul, up to a maximum of 15 yards from the previous spot, and an <b>automatic</b> first <b>down.</b> In U.S. high school rules the penalty is 15 yards from the previous spot with the down replayed for both offensive and defensive pass interference. Prior to 2013, {{the penalty for}} defensive pass interference also included an <b>automatic</b> first <b>down</b> while the penalty for offensive pass interference included a loss of down.
