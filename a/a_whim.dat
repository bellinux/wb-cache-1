5|$|Butler (Sarah-Jane Redmond) is {{introduced}} as the hybristophilic {{wife of a}} serial killer pursued by Black; when the killer is murdered, Black realizes that Butler has been hiding her own murderous past. His attempts to track her lead to Bob Bletcher's death and Butler's escape. Butler is revealed as a demon, capable of changing form on <b>a</b> <b>whim.</b> She later reappears as a succubus, sexually assaulting Black in his sleep to frame him for rape and (as a large snake) trying to kill Emma Hollis. Although both ploys are foiled, Butler escapes.|$|E
5|$|Philo of Alexandria and Seneca the Younger {{describe}} Caligula as {{an insane}} emperor who was self-absorbed, angry, killed on <b>a</b> <b>whim,</b> and indulged {{in too much}} spending and sex. He is accused of sleeping with other men's wives and bragging about it, killing for mere amusement, deliberately wasting money on his bridge, causing starvation, and wanting a statue of himself erected in the Temple of Jerusalem for his worship. Once, at some games at which he was presiding, he ordered his guards to throw an entire section of the audience into the arena during the intermission to be eaten by the wild beasts {{because there were no}} prisoners to be used and he was bored.|$|E
5|$|On 19November 1932, Lerew enlisted as an air cadet in the RAAF active reserve, {{known as}} the Citizen Air Force (CAF). He had marched into Victoria Barracks on <b>a</b> <b>whim</b> and asked to see the person in charge of Air Force recruiting. He was shown {{to the office of}} Squadron Leader Raymond Brownell, also a former Scotch College boy, who {{admitted}} him. Lerew undertook flying instruction on the 1933 'B'course conducted by No.1 Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton, and was commissioned a pilot officer on 1April. He transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force on 20May 1935, following graduation from university, and was promoted flying officer on 1July. Posted to No.1 Aircraft Depot, he was raised to probationary flight lieutenant in 1936. The rank became substantive the following year, when he was appointed Staff Officer Directorate of Works and Buildings at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, responsible for selection and improvement of airfield sites.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>WHIM</b> {{syndrome}} is <b>a</b> molecular disease arising from gain-of-function mutations in CXCR4, preclinical studies identified plerixafor, a specific CXCR4 antagonist, {{as a potential}} mechanism-based therapeutic for the disease. Two subsequent clinical trials involving a handful of patients with WHIM syndrome demonstrated that plerixafor could increase {{white blood cell counts}} and continues to be a promising targeted therapy.|$|R

5|$|On <b>a</b> <b>whim,</b> Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), a young {{reporter}} for the Washington Herald who is stuck covering trivial “human interest” stories, pays a late-night visit to Frank at his home. She offers to be Frank’s undercover mouthpiece in the press {{in exchange for the}} elevated profile that she would gain from breaking substantive stories. Meanwhile, Peter Russo (Corey Stoll), a young, inexperienced congressman from Philadelphia, is arrested for drunk driving. Stamper finds out about the arrest and immediately contacts the D.C. police commissioner, offering Underwood’s support for his mayoral campaign in exchange for releasing Russo and completely covering up the incident. Russo is picked up from jail by his secretary and romantic partner, Christina Gallagher (Kristen Connolly). He lies to her, telling her that he was alone when he was arrested when, in fact, there was a prostitute (Rachel Brosnahan) in the car.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{tendency}} to kill subordinates on <b>a</b> <b>whim,</b> the Joker has no difficulty attracting henchmen with a seemingly infinite cash supply and intimidation: {{they are too}} afraid of their employer to refuse his demands that they wear red clown noses or laugh at macabre jokes. Even with his unpredictability and lack of superhuman powers, the 2007 limited series Salvation Run sees hundreds of villains fall under his spell {{because they are more}} afraid of him than the alternative: Luthor. Batman #186 (1966) introduced the Joker's first sidekick: the one-shot character, Gaggy Gagsworth, who is short, and dressed like a clown; the character was later resurrected as an enemy of his replacement, Harley Quinn. Introduced in the 1992 animated series, Quinn is the Joker's former Arkham psychiatrist who develops an obsessive infatuation with him and dons a red-and-black harlequin costume to join him in the 1999 graphic novel Batman: Harley Quinn. Although Quinn loves the Joker, he is obsessed with Batman and uses her to achieve his goals at her expense. Despite violent abuse, she returns to him. The Joker is sometimes shown to keep hyenas as pets; this trait was introduced in the 1977 animated series The New Adventures of Batman. A 1976 issue of Batman Family introduced Duela Dent as the Joker's daughter, though her parentage claim was later proven to be false.|$|E

25|$|Beam engines {{were found}} to be less {{suitable}} than rotary steam engines, because of the jerk experienced when the piston changed direction, and in Cornwall only the Wheal Reeth man engine, Godolphin, (where a pumping engine was converted to this new use) was powered by a piston acting directly on the rods. When not in use for the man engine, it was an advantage that a rotary engine could also be used to power <b>a</b> <b>whim.</b>|$|E
25|$|UP 4018 – A Union Pacific Big Boy 4-8-8-4 {{articulated}} steam locomotive, originally {{on display}} at Texas State Fair Grounds, Dallas, Texas. Number 4018, currently residing at the Museum of the American Railroad in Frisco, TX, almost saw a return to operation in 1998 when a film director proposed restoring the locomotive {{for use in a}} movie. However, it has been 9 years since anything has been heard of this proposal, and it is considered to have been only <b>a</b> <b>whim.</b>|$|E

25|$|Nivek Ogre as Pavi Largo, Rotti's middle child. Womanizing, narcissistic, vacuous, and effeminate, {{he wears}} the skinned {{face of a}} woman as a mask over his own, which is heavily scarred. Due to the way his face is attached, {{he is able to}} change faces on <b>a</b> <b>whim.</b> He has an Italian accent (to conceal his speech impediment, {{according}} to Zdunich) and is almost always surrounded by women, usually Genterns, the employees of GeneCo, who usually give Pavi his face surgeries.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Roark {{is unable}} to find a client willing to build {{according}} to his vision. He walks away from opportunities that involve any compromise of his standards. Broke, he takes a job as a laborer in a quarry. The quarry belongs to Francon's father and is near their summer home. The vacationing Francon visits the quarry on <b>a</b> <b>whim.</b> As Roark drills into the stone, Francon spots him and watches him work. When he sees her they openly and repeatedly stare at each other.|$|E

25|$|One {{highlight}} of the estate is the outdoor Neptune Pool, located {{near the edge of}} the hilltop, which offers an expansive vista of the mountains, ocean and the main house. Due to drought conditions and leaks in the pool, it is now drained. The Neptune Pool patio features an ancient Roman temple front, transported wholesale from Europe and reconstructed at the site. Hearst was an inveterate tinkerer, and would tear down structures and rebuild them on <b>a</b> <b>whim.</b> For example, the Neptune Pool was rebuilt three times before Hearst was satisfied. As a consequence of Hearst's persistent design changes, the estate was never completed in his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Upon his {{discharge}} in 1946, Altman {{moved to}} California. He worked in publicity {{for a company}} that had invented a tattooing machine to identify dogs. He entered filmmaking on <b>a</b> <b>whim,</b> selling a script to RKO for the 1948 picture Bodyguard, which he co-wrote with George W. George. Altman's immediate success encouraged him to move to New York City, where he attempted to forge a career as a writer. Having enjoyed little success, in 1949 he returned to Kansas City, where he accepted a job as a director and writer of industrial films for the Calvin Company. In February 2012, an early Calvin film directed by Altman, Modern Football (1951), was found by filmmaker Gary Huggins.|$|E

25|$|The {{characters}} must {{fit their}} context. All reputable calligraphers in China were well educated and well read. In addition to calligraphy, they were skilled in other areas, most likely painting, poetry, music, opera, martial arts, and Go. Therefore, their abundant education {{contributed to their}} calligraphy. A calligrapher practicing another calligrapher's characters would always know what the text means, when it was created, and in what circumstances. When they write, their characters' shape and weight agrees with {{the rhythm of the}} phrases, especially in less constrained styles such as semi-cursive and cursive. One who does not know the meaning of the characters they write, but varies their shape and weight on <b>a</b> <b>whim,</b> does not produce good calligraphy.|$|E

She acknowledges her romantic feelings for Bianca, but {{wants to take the}} build-up to romance with Bianca slowly. Maggie joins Bianca and Miranda and moves to Paris, as friends, where she begins to take medical classes. While in Paris, Maggie and Bianca become lovers, as revealed by Bianca in her Christmas 2005 visit to Pine Valley.|$|E
25|$|Author Hristo Stoyanov {{has been}} {{critical}} of the tendency to impute false intellectualism to some of those engaging in legal transgressions as a way of protest, seeing the methods employed by the protesters between 23 and 24 July 2013 {{as a threat to the}} fundamentals of Bulgarian democracy. Analyst Petar Klisarov has voiced his disapproval of the demonstrators (especially the emigrant students who participated in protests on 26 December 2013 and 3 January 2014) for flaunting Bulgarian legal regulations, for example by behaving disrespectfully towards police officers and blocking the city traffic on <b>a</b> <b>whim,</b> suggesting that they would have been much more disciplined and law-abiding if the activities were taking place abroad. Sofia mayor Yordanka Fandakova is also claimed to have been overly permissive of the demonstrators at the expense of the other members of society.|$|E

On the other hand, however, the journey daunted him. He was not a man to sacrifice his creature comforts, and to be asked to sacrifice them to <b>a</b> mere <b>whim,</b> <b>a</b> shadow, added weight to his inclination to refuse the undertaking.|$|R
