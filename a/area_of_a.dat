5|$|Concepts {{related to}} force include: thrust, which {{increases}} the velocity of an object; drag, which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque, which produces changes in rotational speed of an object. In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress. Such internal mechanical stresses cause no accelation of that body as the forces balance one another. Pressure, the distribution of many small forces applied over an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> body, is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate. Stress usually causes deformation of solid materials, or flow in fluids.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, the Chinese {{had simply}} {{approximated}} {{the value of}} pi as 3, until Liu Xin approximated it at 3.154 sometime between 1–5 CE, although the method he used to reach this value is unknown to historians. Standard measuring vessels dating to the reign of Wang Mang (9–23 CE) also showed approximations for pi at 3.1590, 3.1497, and 3.167. Zhang Heng is the next known Han mathematician to have made an approximation for pi. Han mathematicians understood that the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> square versus the area of its inscribed circle had an approximate ratio of 4:3, and also understood that the volume of a cube and the volume of its inscribed sphere would be 42:32. With D as diameter and V as volume, D3:V = 16:9 or V=9⁄16D3, a formula Zhang found fault with since he realized the value for diameter was inaccurate, the discrepancy being the value taken for the ratio. To fix this, Zhang added 1⁄16D3 to the formula, thus V = 9⁄16D3 + 1⁄16D3 = 5⁄8D3. Since he found {{the ratio of the}} volume of the cube to the inscribed sphere at 8:5, the ratio of the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> square to the inscribed circle is √8:√5. With this formula, Zhang was able to approximate pi as the square root of 10, or 3.162. After the Han, Liu Hui approximated pi as 3.14159, while the mathematician Zu Chongzhi (429–500 CE) approximated pi at 3.141592 (or 355⁄113), the most accurate approximation the ancient Chinese would achieve.|$|E

5|$|Archimedes {{was able}} to use infinitesimals {{in a way that is}} similar to modern {{integral}} calculus. Through proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the value of π. In Measurement of a Circle he did this by drawing a larger regular hexagon outside a circle and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he {{was able to}} determine that the value of π lay between 3 (approximately 3.1429) and 3 (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416. He also proved that the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> circle was equal to π multiplied by the square of the radius of the circle (πr2). In On the Sphere and Cylinder, Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. This is the Archimedean property of real numbers.|$|E

5|$|For {{stationary}} shots where Superman is seen flying toward or {{away from}} the camera, blue screen matte techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be 'inserted' into a matted <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would {{give the appearance of}} flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. The disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the matted image—in this case, Superman—do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{possible}} to rule out many explanations of the observed divergences in the masses of the world's prototypes proposed by scientists and the general public. The BIPM's FAQ explains, for example, that the divergence {{is dependent on the}} amount of time elapsed between measurements and not dependent on the number of times the artifacts have been cleaned or possible changes in gravity or environment. Reports published in 2013 by Peter Cumpson of Newcastle University based on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of samples that were stored alongside various prototype kilograms suggested that one source of the divergence between the various prototypes could be traced to mercury that had been absorbed by the prototypes being in the proximity of mercury-based instruments. The IPK has been stored within centimetres of a mercury thermometer since at least {{as far back as the}} late 1980s. In this Newcastle University work six platinum weights made in the nineteenth century were all found to have mercury at the surface, the most contaminated of which had the equivalent of 250µg of mercury when scaled to the surface <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> kilogram prototype.|$|E

The system also includes special routes of the U.S. and state routes, such as alternate, business, and truck routes. These routes consist of a banner denoting the type of special route above the route marker. Alternate routes provide a second alignment of a route between two points. DE 10 Alternate provides an alternate routing to DE 10 between Willow Grove and Rising Sun by passing through Woodside while DE 10 passes through Camden. Business routes pass through the business <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> city while the main route bypasses it. DE 1 Business passes through the central portion of Milford while DE 1 bypasses {{the city to the}} east. Truck routes provide an alternate route for trucks around a certain portion of a route. DE 14 Truck provides a route for truck traffic that bypasses the section of DE 14 that passes through Harrington. Suffixed routes also exist for short alignments that branch off their parent routes, in which a letter suffix is added after the route number. DE 1 has three suffixed routes in the Rehoboth Beach area while DE 9A provides access to the Port of Wilmington from DE 9. In addition to these systems are other state roads designated with a maintenance road number.|$|E
