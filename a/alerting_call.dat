40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} capacity <b>alert</b> <b>calls</b> in reducing acute hospital overcrowding through addressing rising occupancy, high patient throughput and increased access block. Methods. Retrospective analysis of 24 months of in-patient, emergency department, and capacity <b>alert</b> <b>call</b> log data from a largemetropolitan public hospital inAustralia. The analysis explored statistical differences in patientflowparameters between capacity <b>alert</b> <b>call</b> days and other days including a control case set of days with statistically similar levels of occupancy. Results. The study identified a significant (P < 0. 05) reduction in occupancy, patient throughput and access block on capacity <b>alert</b> <b>call</b> days. Capacity <b>alert</b> <b>call</b> days reversed rising occupancy trends, with 6 out of 7 flow parameters reporting significant improvement (P < 0. 05) over the 48 h following the call. Only 3 of these 7 flow parameters were significantly improved 48 h after control case days, confirming value in the alertmechanism and that the results are not a regression toward the mean phenomenon. Conclusions. Escalation processes that alert and engage the whole hospital in tackling overcrowding can successfully deliver sustained improvements in occupancy, patient throughput and access block. Thefindings support and validate the use of capacity <b>alert</b> escalation <b>calls</b> to manage overcrowding, but suggest {{the need to improve}} the consistency of trigge...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Safety {{applications}} {{designed for}} Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) can be compromised by participating vehicles transmitting false or inaccurate information. Mechanisms that detect and report such misbehaving nodes leading to node eviction or termination of such messages {{is an important}} problem in VANETs. In this paper, we investigate {{the possibility of using}} correlated information or <b>alerts,</b> <b>called</b> “secondary alerts”, generated in response to another <b>alert,</b> <b>called</b> as the “primary alert ” to verify the truth or falsity of the primary alert received by a vehicle. We first propose a framework to model how such correlated secondary information observed from more than one source can be integrated to generate a “degree of belief ” for the primary alert. We then show an instantiation of the model proposed for the specific case of Post-Crash Notification as the primary alert received and Slow/Stopped Vehicle Advisory as the secondary alerts possibly generated in response to the primary alert. Finally, we present the design and evaluation of a misbehavior detection scheme (MDS) for PCN application using such correlated information to illustrate that such information can be used efficiently for MDS design...|$|R

50|$|The call heard {{most often}} {{by people in}} or near Jozani Forest is the 'alerting signal'. This is an attention-getting call that {{is derived from the}} {{progression}} call. Chirps and grunts are made when there are changes in the surrounding environment such as changes in weather or animal movement in proximity to the group. With most arboreal animals, there are two different <b>alerting</b> <b>calls,</b> one for when a predator is on land, and another when there is an aerial predator. However, {{because of the lack of}} larger birds of prey in Zanzibar, such calls are not often witnessed. The young, on the other hand, because of their smaller size and vulnerability, do at times make such calls when they see shadows.|$|R

40|$|International audienceHuman {{language}} has evolved on a biological substrate with phylogenetic roots {{deep in the}} primate lineage. Here, we describe a functional analogy to a common morphological process in human speech, affixation, in the alarm calls of free-ranging adult Campbell's monkeys (Cercopithecus campbelli campbelli). We found that male alarm calls are composed of an acoustically variable stem, which can be followed by an acoustically invariable suffix. Using long-term observations and predator simulation experiments, we show that suffixation in this species functions to broaden the calls' meaning by transforming a highly specific eagle alarm to a general arboreal disturbance call or by transforming a highly specific leopard alarm call to a general <b>alert</b> <b>call.</b> We concluded that, when referring to specific external events, non-human primates can generate meaningful acoustic variation during call production that is functionally equivalent to suffixation in human languag...|$|R
