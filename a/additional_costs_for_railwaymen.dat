40|$|AbstractWhen semiexplicit differential-algebraic {{equations}} are solved with implicit Runge-Kutta methods (RK), the computational {{effort is}} dominated by the cost of solving the nonlinear systems, and therefore {{it is important to have}} good starting values to begin the iterations. For semiexplicit index- 2 DAEs, starting algorithms without <b>additional</b> <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> RK methods with regular matrix coefficient were studied in a previous paper. However, the regularity condition on the matrix coefficient excludes some interesting methods like Lobatto IIIa and ESDIRK methods. In this paper, we study starting algorithms, without <b>additional</b> computational <b>cost,</b> <b>for</b> a class of Runge-Kutta methods in the case of index- 2 DAEs...|$|R
