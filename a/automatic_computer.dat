5|$|Konrad Zuse's Z3 was the world's first working programmable, fully <b>automatic</b> <b>computer,</b> with binary digital {{arithmetic}} logic, but {{it lacked}} the conditional branching of a Turing machine. On 12 May 1941, it was successfully presented {{to an audience}} of scientists of the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt ("German Laboratory for Aviation") in Berlin. The Z3 stored its program on an external tape, but it was electromechanical rather than electronic. The Colossus of 1943 was the first electronic computing device, {{but it was not a}} general-purpose machine.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the history}} of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory it has been the site of various super{{computer}}s, home to the fastest on several occasions. In 1953, ORNL partnered with the Argonne National Laboratory to build ORACLE (Oak Ridge <b>Automatic</b> <b>Computer</b> and Logical Engine), a computer to research nuclear physics, chemistry, biology and engineering. ORACLE had 2048words (80Kibit) of memory and took approximately 590microseconds to perform addition or multiplications of integers. In the 1960s ORNL was also equipped with an IBM 360/91 and an IBM 360/65. In 1995 ORNL bought an Intel Paragon based computer called the Intel Paragon XP/S 150 that performed at 154gigaFLOPS and ranked third on the TOP500 list of supercomputers. In 2005 Jaguar was built, a Cray XT3 based system that performed at 25teraFLOPS and received incremental upgrades up to the XT5 platform that performed at 2.3petaFLOPS in 2009. It was recognised as the world's fastest from November 2009 until November 2010.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{following}} months, Eckert and Mauchly {{started up the}} Electronic Control Company which built the Binary <b>Automatic</b> <b>Computer</b> (BINAC). One of the major advances of this machine, which was used from August 1950, was that data was stored on magnetic tape. The Electronic Control Company soon became the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation and it received an order from the National Bureau of Standards to build the Universal <b>Automatic</b> <b>Computer</b> (UNIVAC). He was awarded the Howard N. Potts Medal in 1949. [...] In 1950, Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation ran into financial troubles and was acquired by Remington Rand Corporation. [...] The UNIVAC I was finished on December 21, 1950.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1951, the UNIVAC I (Universal <b>Automatic</b> <b>Computer)</b> was {{delivered}} to the U.S. Census Bureau. Remington Rand eventually sold 46 machines at more than US$1 million each ($ as of [...] ). UNIVAC was the first [...] "mass produced" [...] computer. It used 5,200 vacuum tubes and consumed 125kW of power. Its primary storage was serial-access mercury delay lines capable of storing 1,000 words of 11 decimal digits plus sign (72-bit words).|$|E
2500|$|To prevail on a {{claim of}} direct infringement, a {{plaintiff}} must prove that the defendant engaged in [...] "volitional conduct" [...] that caused the infringement. Here, {{the court held that}} [...] "there is no evidence of volitional conduct, thereby preventing Wolk from establishing direct liability." [...] Kodak fulfilled orders from Photobucket through an <b>automatic</b> <b>computer</b> system without any human intervention. Since the process was entirely automated, Kodak lacked the volition necessary to hold it liable for direct infringement.|$|E
2500|$|By 1943, {{the term}} acronym {{had been used}} in English to {{recognize}} abbreviations (and contractions of phrases) that were pronounced as words. (It was formed from the Greek words , , [...] "topmost, extreme" [...] and , , [...] "name.") For example, the army offense of being absent without official leave was abbreviated to [...] "A.W.O.L." [...] in reports, but when pronounced as a word (awol), it became an acronym. While initial letters are commonly used to form an acronym, the original definition was [...] "a word made from the initial letters or syllables of other words", for example UNIVAC from UNIVersal <b>Automatic</b> <b>Computer.</b>|$|E

2500|$|For live programs, spoken words {{comprising}} the television program's soundtrack are transcribed by a human operator (a speech-to-text reporter) using stenotype or stenomask type of machines, whose phonetic output is instantly translated into text {{by a computer}} and displayed on the screen. This technique {{was developed in the}} 1970s as an initiative of the BBC's Ceefax teletext service. In collaboration with the BBC, a university student took on the research project of writing the first phonetics-to-text conversion program for this purpose. Sometimes, the captions of live broadcasts, like news bulletins, sports events, live entertainment shows, and other live shows, fall behind by a few seconds. This delay is because the machine does not know what the person is going to say next, so after the person on the show says the sentence, the captions appear. <b>Automatic</b> <b>computer</b> speech recognition now works well when trained to recognize a single voice, and so since 2003, the BBC does live subtitling by having someone re-speak what is being broadcast. Live captioning is also a form of real-time text. Meanwhile, sport events on channels like ESPN are using court reporters, using a special (steno) keyboard and individually constructed [...] "dictionaries." ...|$|E
