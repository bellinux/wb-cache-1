In addition to enclosures for cottontop tamarin, toco toucan and Aldabra giant tortoises, it also has many free-ranging birds, including Cape thick-knee, lilac-breasted roller, <b>African</b> <b>jacana,</b> sunbittern and brown-hooded kingfisher.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>jacana</b> (Actophilornis africanus) is a wader in {{the family}} Jacanidae, {{identifiable}} by long toes and long claws {{that enable them to}} walk on floating vegetation in shallow lakes, their preferred habitat. Jacanas are found worldwide within the tropical zone, and this species is found in sub-saharan Africa. For the origin and pronunciation of the name, see jacana.|$|E
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>jacanas</b> feed on {{insects and}} other {{invertebrates}} picked from the floating vegetation or {{the surface of}} the water.|$|R
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>jacanas</b> breed {{throughout}} sub-Saharan Africa. It is sedentary {{apart from}} seasonal dispersion. It lays four black-marked brown {{eggs in a}} floating nest.|$|R
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>jacanas</b> are {{conspicuous}} and unmistakable birds. They {{are about}} 30 cm long, but females {{are larger than}} males. They have chestnut upperparts with black wingtips, rear neck, and eyestripe. The underparts are also chestnut in the adults, only in juveniles they are white with a chestnut belly patch. The blue bill extends up as a coot-like head shield, and the legs and long toes are grey.|$|R
50|$|The parent {{that forms}} {{part of the}} harem is almost always the one that ends up caring for the offspring; in this case, each male jacana incubates and rears a nest of chicks. The male <b>African</b> <b>jacana</b> has {{therefore}} evolved some remarkable adaptations for parental care, {{such as the ability}} to pick up and carry chicks underneath its wings.|$|E

50|$|Its shores and {{waters are}} favored by birds, such as cranes, herons, pelicans, <b>African</b> <b>jacanas,</b> egrets and waders, which find {{excellent}} feeding over the large spaces near the extremities and shore line of bays. These {{are covered with}} close-packed growths of Pistia stratiotes rigl plants. Kobus ellipsiprymnus and Hippopotamus amphibius frequent the area. There are armies of black mosquitoes. Lake fish were infested with guinea worm {{at the time of}} Stanley's expedition.|$|R
50|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the species often reacts aggressively to other lapwings or <b>African</b> <b>jacanas</b> that may enter its wetland habitat. Nests are shallow depressions on bare ground or short grass, close to water, {{and tend to}} be spaced at least 400 m apart. The blacksmith lapwing breeds in spring, but its choice of nesting site and timing may be opportunistic. The young separate gradually from their parents and do not return to natal areas afterwards. This lapwing feeds on aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates.|$|R
5000|$|Sitatunga {{can feed}} or rest close to {{southern}} lechwe herds, {{but do not}} interact with them. They often attract yellow-billed oxpeckers, <b>African</b> <b>jacanas</b> and great egrets. Sitatunga are good swimmers, but limit themselves to water with profuse vegetation in order to escape crocodiles. In some cases, for instance when troubled by flies or pursued by predators, the sitatunga might fully submerge themselves in the water except for the nose and the eyes, which they keep slightly above the water surface. Due to its close association with water, the sitatunga are often described as [...] "aquatic antelopes", like the waterbuck. They often dry themselves under the sun after feeding in water. Predators of the sitatunga include lions, wild dogs, crocodiles and leopards.|$|R
40|$|Bird counts {{were carried}} out at thirty-four study sites within a {{perimeter}} of 10 km from the shorelines of the two lakes, while all bird captures were conducted on a few sites along the shorelines of the two lakes. Both counting (22 missions) and capturing (15 missions) produced records of 297 bird species. A total of 2135 birds of 110 species were ringed, with total numbers of ringed birds per mission ranging from 34 (lowest in November 2010) to 294 (November 2008). The most commonly ringed bird species were Redbilled Teal (636), <b>African</b> <b>Jacana</b> (408), White-faced Duck (218), Blacksmith Lapwing (113), Kittlitz's Plover (84), Wood Sandpiper (53), African Snipe (35), Redbilled Quelea (32), Barn Swallow (31) and Hottentot Teal (29). Most of the waterbird species were captured during the cold/dry to hot/dry seasons (July to November) when water levels on both lakes were low. Ten species of duck, goose and teal captured accounted for 43. 3 % of all the birds ringed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

5000|$|Operation Jacana is the codename for {{a series}} of {{operations}} carried out by coalition forces in Afghanistan. The operations were carried out most notably by 45 Commando Royal Marines. U.S. forces, Australian SAS and Norwegian FSK also participated. The operation was a follow-up operation of Operation Anaconda and was meant to kill or capture the remaining Al-Qaida and Taliban rebels. The operation has been called a [...] "mopping up" [...] operation after Operation Anaconda. The operation is named after an <b>African</b> bird type, <b>jacana,</b> described in one manual as [...] "shy, retiring, easily overlooked".|$|R
