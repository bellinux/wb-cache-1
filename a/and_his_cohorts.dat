All but Kint and a Hungarian are {{killed in the}} attack. Baer believes there were no drugs and the true purpose of the attack was to eliminate a passenger who could identify Söze. Kujan confronts Kint with the theory that Söze {{is one of the}} four other criminals with whom Verbal had worked: a corrupt former police officer and professional thief named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne). Kujan's investigation of Keaton is what involved him in the case.|$|E
5|$|On 8 November 1923 Hitler and the SA stormed {{a public}} meeting of 3,000 people {{organised}} by Kahr in the Bürgerbräukeller, a beer hall in Munich. Interrupting Kahr's speech, {{he announced that}} the national revolution had begun and declared {{the formation of a}} new government with Ludendorff. Retiring to a back room, Hitler, with handgun drawn, demanded and got the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow. Hitler's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cohorts</b> quickly withdrew their support. Neither the army, nor the state police, joined forces with Hitler. The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them. Sixteen NSDAP members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.|$|E
5|$|As a student, {{he joined}} the Croatian Party of Rights but, viewed as a {{dissident}} in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, he fled the country to avoid arrest and eventually settled in Germany where he obtained a doctorate in law at the University of Berlin. In 1934, {{he joined the}} Ustaše and became a close associate of Ante Pavelić. Although he was initially commander of all Ustaše in Germany, where he sought support in creating and protecting a Croatian state, he later became leader of all Ustaše outside Italy. Soon after {{the establishment of the}} NDH, he was appointed as Foreign Minister and strongly opposed Italian influence on the state. After his cabinet chief, Ivo Kolak, was executed in 1943 for smuggling gold, Lorković was removed from office but later named Minister of Interior. As Minister of Interior, he negotiated with the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) in the hopes of establishing a coalition government. He also held secret negotiations with HSS representatives to propose having the NDH join the Allies against Germany. Although he apparently had the support of Pavelić, he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cohorts</b> were soon arrested as conspirators against the state and after a period in detention was executed at the end of April 1945 alongside Ante Vokić.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the course}} of the play, the protagonist Palaestrio <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cohort</b> behave as good Greek (or, rather, Roman) citizens, exhibiting such virtues as {{hospitality}} and generosity (Periplectomenus), loyalty (Palaestrio to Pleusicles), and virtue (Philocomasium). Conversely, Pyrgopolynices <b>and</b> <b>his</b> household engage in vice, including womanizing and boastfulness (Pyrgopolynices) and sloth and excessive drinking (Lurcio and Sceledrus). Palaestrio <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cohort</b> show the value of cooperation when they work together to convince Sceledrus (idiocy) that he did not see what he actually did. Later, by succeeding in tricking Pyrgopolynices (vanity and ego) and reuniting the lovers, Palaestrio <b>and</b> <b>his</b> allies show the superiority of virtue over vice. This is reinforced in the end as Pyrgopolynices, recognizing his defeat, remarks to the audience that they should ‘serve all lechers so, and lechery will grow less rife’. His concession is a clear denunciation by the playwright of the soldier’s corrupt ways.|$|R
