5|$|According to Bieber, {{he wanted}} to release the album for the naysayers who critiqued his actual singing ability. The singer said that {{he wanted to}} have an <b>acoustic</b> album, to reflect the effect of {{production}} on his vocals. Although labeled as an <b>acoustic</b> album, the songs still include subtle usages of electronic sounds such as synthesizers. The album received generally favorable reviews from critics, however most critics were not satisfied that the album was not genuinely <b>acoustic.</b> In Canada, the song debuted at number five, and later peaked at number four on the Canadian Albums Chart and certified Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. My Worlds <b>Acoustic</b> debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200, selling 115,000 copies in its first week, becoming Bieber's third consecutive top ten album.|$|E

40|$|<b>Acoustics,</b> {{the science}} of sound, has {{developed}} into a broad interdisciplinary field encompassing the academic disciplines of physics, engineering, psychology, speech, audiology, music, architecture, physiology, neuroscience, and others. The Springer Handbook of <b>Acoustics</b> is an unparalleled modern handbook reflecting this richly interdisciplinary nature edited {{by one of the}} acknowledged masters in the field, Thomas Rossing. Researchers and students benefit from the comprehensive contents spanning: animal <b>acoustics</b> including infrasound and ultrasound, environmental noise control, music and human speech and singing, physiological and psychological <b>acoustics,</b> architectural <b>acoustics,</b> physical and engineering <b>acoustics,</b> signal processing, medical <b>acoustics,</b> and ocean <b>acoustics.</b> This handbook reviews the most important areas of <b>acoustics,</b> with emphasis on current research. The authors of the various chapters are all experts in their fields. Each chapter is richly illustrated with figures and tables. The latest research and applications are incorporated throughout, e. g. computer recognition and synthesis of speech, physiological <b>acoustics,</b> psychological <b>acoustics,</b> thermoacoustics, diagnostic imaging and therapeutic applications and acoustical oceanography.

25|$|<b>Acoustic</b> phonons are {{coherent}} {{movements of}} atoms of the lattice {{out of their}} equilibrium positions. If the displacement is {{in the direction of}} propagation, then in some areas the atoms will be closer, in others farther apart, as in a sound wave in air (hence the name <b>acoustic).</b> Displacement perpendicular to the propagation direction is comparable to waves in water. If the wavelength of <b>acoustic</b> phonons goes to infinity, this corresponds to a simple displacement of the whole crystal, and this costs zero energy. <b>Acoustic</b> phonons exhibit a linear relationship between frequency and phonon wavevector for long wavelengths. The frequencies of <b>acoustic</b> phonons tend to zero with longer wavelength. Longitudinal and transverse <b>acoustic</b> phonons are often abbreviated as LA and TA phonons, respectively.|$|E
