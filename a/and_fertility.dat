5|$|Birth control, {{also known}} as {{contraception}} <b>and</b> <b>fertility</b> control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century. Planning, making available, and using birth control is called family planning. Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.|$|E
5|$|In Thailand, the phallus is also {{considered}} to be a symbol of good luck and representative of fertility. There are numerous shrines in the country featuring phallic architecture.

Vivacity of composition <b>and</b> <b>fertility</b> were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended {{over a long period of}} time under the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E
5|$|Obesity is {{a leading}} {{preventable}} cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2015, 600 million adults (12%) and 100 million children were obese. Obesity {{is more common in}} women than men. Authorities view it {{as one of the most}} serious public health problems of the 21stcentury. Obesity is stigmatized in much of the modern world (particularly in the Western world), though it was seen as a symbol of wealth <b>and</b> <b>fertility</b> at other times in history and still is in some parts of the world. In 2013, the American Medical Association classified obesity as a disease.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Inca dominance, {{specialized}} {{long distance}} merchants provided the highlanders with goods such as gold nuggets, copper hatchets, cocoa, salt etc. for redistribution among the locals, and were {{key players in}} the politics of the region. Hatchet shaped copper currency was produced by the Peruvian people, in order to obtain valuables from pre Columbian Ecuador. A maritime exchange system stretched from the west coast of Mexico to southernmost Peru, trading mostly in Spondylus, which represented rain <b>and</b> <b>fertility</b> and was considered the principal food of the gods by the people of the Inca empire. Spondylus was used in elite rituals, and the effective redistribution of it had political effect in the Andes during the pre-Hispanic times.|$|E

5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{depicts the}} Roman goddess of love, beauty <b>and</b> <b>fertility</b> {{reclining}} languidly on her bed, {{her back to}} the viewer—in Antiquity, portrayal of Venus from a back view was a common visual and literary erotic motif—and her knees tucked. She is shown without the mythological paraphernalia normally included in depictions of the scene; jewellery, roses, and myrtle are all absent. Unlike most earlier portrayals of the goddess, which show her with blond hair, Velázquez's Venus is a brunette. The female figure can be identified as Venus {{because of the presence of}} her son, Cupid.|$|E
5|$|Candi Sukuh {{temple of}} Ngancar, East Java, {{was built in}} the 10th century and is {{dedicated}} to Shiva and is evidence of Tantric ritual in Hinduism and the fertility cult practiced at the time and preoccupation with the lingga. The temple has numerous reliefs graphically depicting sexuality <b>and</b> <b>fertility</b> including several stone depictions of a copulating penis and vagina. It consists of a pyramid with reliefs and statues at the front. Among them is a male statue clutching his penis, with three tortoises with flattened shells. The temple once had a striking 1.82 metre (5'11.5ft) representation of lingga with four testicles; this is now housed in the National Museum of Indonesia. Phallic references were also made in Khmer architecture in Cambodia, and several Khmer temples depict the phallus in reliefs.|$|E
5|$|In {{veterinary}} practice, {{dogs are}} the species most commonly affected by hypothyroidism. The {{majority of cases}} occur {{as a result of}} primary hypothyroidism, of which two types are recognized: lymphocytic thyroiditis, which is probably immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by fatty tissue. There is often lethargy, cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, and weight gain. Furthermore, skin changes <b>and</b> <b>fertility</b> problems are seen in dogs with hypothyroidism, {{as well as a number}} of other symptoms. The signs of myxedema can be seen in dogs, with prominence of skin folds on the forehead, and cases of myxedema coma are encountered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is associated with detectable antibodies against thyroglobulin, although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease. Treatment is with thyroid hormone replacement.|$|E

This paper contributes to our knowledge of fertility differentials by investigating if there is a relationship between family structure <b>and</b> completed <b>fertility,</b> <b>and</b> whether this relationship is modified by first birth experience. Our results show that coming from an intact family significantly lowers competed fertility.

5|$|The most {{effective}} methods {{of birth control}} are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable birth control. This {{is followed by a}} number of hormone-based methods including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections. Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and birth control sponges <b>and</b> <b>fertility</b> awareness methods. The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation. Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them. Safe sex practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections. Other methods of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex. Some argue not having sex as a form of birth control, but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without birth control education, due to non-compliance.|$|E

3000|$|... 8 Other {{strand of}} the {{literature}} looks at how labour market institutions affects fertility. Adsera (2004, 2005) finds that on a country level the <b>fertility</b> <b>and</b> fraction of self-employed are negatively correlated while <b>fertility</b> <b>and</b> the duration of maternity leave are positively correlated. This indicates that institutions are likely to affect both the choice of occupation <b>and</b> the <b>fertility</b> decision.
