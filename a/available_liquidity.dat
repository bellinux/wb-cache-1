Monetary policy implementation then matters for the pass-through of policy rate changes and rationalizes liquidity premia on treasuries.

5000|$|The absurd {{result of}} {{valuable}} stocks being executed for a penny likely was {{attributable to the}} use of a practice called [...] "stub quoting." [...] When a market order is submitted for a stock, if <b>available</b> <b>liquidity</b> has already been taken out, the market order will seek the next <b>available</b> <b>liquidity,</b> regardless of price. When a market maker’s liquidity has been exhausted, or if it is unwilling to provide liquidity, it may at that time submit what is called a stub quote—for example, an offer to buy a given stock at a penny. A stub quote is essentially a place holder quote because that quote would never—it is thought—be reached. When a market order is seeking liquidity and the only liquidity available is a penny-priced stub quote, the market order, by its terms, will execute against the stub quote. In this respect, automated trading systems will follow their coded logic regardless of outcome, while human involvement likely would have prevented these orders from executing at absurd prices. As noted below, we are reviewing the practice of displaying stub quotes that are never intended to be executed.|$|E

The resulting aggregate failure to extend and retain capital in the economy suggests that agency costs that force banks to rely on sticky balance-sheet-based credit limits prevent emerging economies from effectively intermediating capital.

Anecdotal evidence indicates that nobody would show a bid anywhere close to that consensus level.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} liquidity {{and credit}} risks {{in the context}} of interdependent interbank payment systems. A simple model is developed to investigate the operation of two real time gross settlement systems interlinked through FX transactions conducted by a set of global banks that participate in both systems. In addition, further interdependence is created by imposing a Payment versus Payment (PvP) constraint. The model illustrates under which conditions settlement of payments in the two systems becomes correlated and how credit exposures are created as the result of liquidity pressures in one of the two systems. PvP can eliminate this credit risk but will make the settlement process of each system dependent on the level of <b>liquidity</b> <b>available</b> in the other system. The consequences of an operational disruption affecting a bank participating in only one system are investigated. The crisis is shown to spread to the other system with different consequences depending on the level of <b>liquidity</b> <b>available</b> and the settlement mechanism used for FX transactions. Different channels of cross-currency channels of crisis propagation are identified...|$|R

Consequently, finance is characterized by strong empirical traditions. Lots of analysis is done on data from stock exchanges including bids, asks, transaction prices, volume, etc. There is also data available from information services on actions and events that may influence markets. Data from these sources is not able to report on expectations, on which theory of financial markets is built. In experimental markets the researcher is able to know expectations, and control fundamental values, trading institutions, and market parameters such as <b>available</b> <b>liquidity</b> and the total stock of the asset. This gives the researcher the ability to know the price and other predictions of alternative theories. This creates the opportunity to do powerful tests on the robustness of theories which were not possible from field data, since there is little knowledge on the parameters and expectations from field data.|$|E

The Granger causality tests show that while there is almost no evidence of causality (in both directions) before each crisis, during each crisis, approximately half of the pairwise tests were significant.

Therefore, it is concluded that the more crucial phenomenon during these crises is the “reverse feedback effects” rather than the liquidity contagion itself...|$|R

We discuss the implications for the debate on mark-to-market versus historic cost accounting...|$|R
40|$|Most conceptual, {{exploratory}} and explanatory {{investigations into}} the motivations to enter franchising arrangements have taken only the situation of a traditional single unit owner-operator into account. Presumably, franchisees are attracted to these contractual vertical marketing networks as they {{become part of a}} larger, established system with a proven brand and consumer following, while retaining some independence and receiving financial support, and initial and ongoing operational assistance. However, multiple unit franchisees may differ from their single unit counterparts in terms of their experience, philosophical orientations and expectancies. Therefore, a single theoretical model of franchisee motivations that postulates symmetry of motives would be unrealistic and untenable. Instead this research aims to build theory through the presentation of a set of propositions that explains multiple unit franchising as a function of an individual's need for empowerment, anticipation of future scale economies, <b>available</b> financial <b>liquidity,</b> entrepreneurial orientation and desire to minimise future intra-system conflict. Overall, the qualitative findings clarified and confirmed the validity of the general propositions in preparation for future empirical testing.

We find support for the “political ” view that greater corruption and government involvement lead to larger information asymmetries between investors and issuers which, in turn, reduces liquidity and foreign equity investment, and increases execution risk. The orthogonalized adverse effects of corruption and government involvement remain significant for execution risk and foreign portfolio investment even after controlling for the country‟s efficiency of judicial system, the country‟s legal origin, and several other macro-level institutional variables...|$|R

With data from the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances we identify key predictors of new credit card charges for households. The data suggest credit card spending appears motivated by low-cost access to credit card liquidity. This {{is consistent with previous}} research arguing credit card use is rational, but is contrary to research that emphasizes liquidity constraints in explaining credit card behavior. New credit card charges are primarily predicted by the amount of <b>available</b> <b>liquidity</b> on the card (the limit minus the balance) for all households, controlling for income and other factors. The data also show that credit card spending is primarily done by the more educated and wealthier households, at all income quintiles, and that liquidity constraints {{have little to do with}} credit card use...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of returns in financial time series exhibits heavy tails. In empirical studies, {{it has been}} found that gaps between the orders in the order book lead to large price shifts and thereby to these heavy tails. We set up an agent based model to study this issue and, in particular, how the gaps in the order book emerge. The trading mechanism in our model is based on a double-auction order book, which is used on nearly all stock exchanges. In situations where the order book is densely occupied with limit orders we do not observe fat-tailed distributions. As soon as less liquidity is available, a gap structure forms which leads to return distributions with heavy tails. We show that return distributions with heavy tails are an order-book effect if the <b>available</b> <b>liquidity</b> is constrained. This is largely independent of the specific trading strategies...|$|E
