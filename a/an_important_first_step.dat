5|$|The {{distance}} to the Pleiades {{can be used as}} <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of the {{distance to}} the Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the {{distance to the}} Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E

In South Africa, foraging effort of breeding African penguins decreased by 30 per cent within three months of closing a 20 km zone to the competing purse-seine fisheries around their largest colony. After the fishing ban, most of the penguins from this island had shifted their feeding effort inside the closed area. Birds breeding at another colony situated 50 km away, whose fishing grounds remained open to fishing, increased their foraging effort during the same period.

The results were confined to information available in the electronic medical record and were subject to variability in provider documentation (e.g., various exam documentation styles, grading scales, codes), which can introduce bias.

Certain parameters such as patient symptomatology and compliance with treatment regimen could not be evaluated unless they were deliberately reported in the charts.
