National HIV Testing Day {{was developed by the}} National Association of People With AIDS (NAPWA) in 1995 to provide a focal point for testing promotion activities nationally. NAPWA created the campaign in response to a growing number of new HIV infections among specific populations in the United States and a widespread ambivalence among many Americans about the value of knowing their HIV sero-status. The campaign sends a signal from people living with HIV and AIDS that there are strong reasons for people at risk for HIV infection to learn their sero-status early and take charge of their health and future.

40|$|IN THE FLURRY {{of concern}} over the {{appointments}} of vocal right-wingers to the ABC board - Ron Brunton, Janet Albrechtsen and now Keith Windschuttle - the broadcaster 2 ̆ 7 s supporters {{are in danger of}} losing focus. Demonising individuals doesn 2 ̆ 7 t help. The real dangers are in commercialisation, which the broadcasters 2 ̆ 7 supporters should do all they can to resist; and beyond that, in the new board members 2 ̆ 7 guiding concepts on nationality and history. With all its acknowledged value in nation-building, the ABC has survived 74 years in the teeth of recurrent political hostility, no matter which party was in power. Windschuttle?s anxieties about alleged Marxists and radicals come in a longer tradition than he may realise. It 2 ̆ 7 s more than 40 years since the RSL began alleging Communist influence inside the broadcaster - that was after Allan Ashbolt 2 ̆ 7 s legendary Four Corners, in August 1962, on the RSL 2 ̆ 7 s political strength. In late 1978, the outgoing commissioner Richard Harding told a press conference that the Fraser government had reduced the ABC to 2 ̆ 7 a timid, dispirited and punch-drunk organisation. 2 ̆ 7 In protest against funding cuts and the abolition of the position of staff-elected commissioner, held at that time by Marius Webb, the staff engaged in rolling strikes. ?Save the ABC? rallies were held in several cities; Friends of the ABC circulated a wonderful poster showing Aunty on the rampage in flying petticoats, stilt heels, brolly and handbag. The Commission survived further strictures and punishments through the prolonged period of the Dix Committee of Review, became a Corporation, endured the enmity of Labor governments ? the moment when presenter Jane Singleton pulled the plug on Bob Hawke remains an agreeable comic memory ? and lived to fight another day. Remember the Mansfield report? This is not to say plus ?a change, plus c?est la m?me chose. The broadcaster?s survival {{has a lot to do}} with the resilience of good liberal journalism and an unsinkable public demand for it. But while no government likes independent critical enquiry, our present masters like it even less than most. These appointments do constitute the threat of destruction from within, but not because Windschuttle and company amuse themselves with oldstyle Cold War games. (Reds under the Kath and Kim sofas, or Peter Cundall?s garden-beds? It?s a charade.) What matters is that they?re likely to promote advertising in or between programs. Opposition to ads on the ABC is generally read as nothing more than cultural snobbery, middle-class aversion to crassness. But for the ABC, commercials ? however limited and regulated, in however much bland good taste ? would be the thin end of a malignant wedge: increased dependence on chancy commercial revenue, further decreases in public funding, and the inevitable inhibition of critical content in line with advertisers? pressures and competition with other channels. With those threats looming, public broadcasting needs all the friends it can get. The kinds of supportive action taken 30 years ago mightn?t work now; a strike of program-makers would probably be ammunition for the enemy. Better to email the minister, her colleagues <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>local</b> members ? particularly to those on the Coalition side, to independents, and to those representing regional and remote Australia. Justice should be seen to be done. Ideally, nobody should be considered for board membership without a clear commitment to the principles in the ABC?s Charter, particularly those on independence for the purposes of ?adequate and comprehensive? programming. Neither Senator Coonan nor those she has appointed show any such allegiance. Challenged by Mark Colvin on PM about political balance, she evaded the issue, appealing to ?a mix of skills? and invoking Windschuttle?s past concerns with media and journalism. But it?s rather as though a Labor government had appointed John Pilger ? instead of, say, some more discriminating left-liberal like Stuart Macintyre or Judith Brett. It?s all further evidence on the government?s disquieting insulation from informed opinion at large. Coonan seems amazingly unaware of how far middle-class Australia is, and wishes to be, anti-racist; and their special take on race relations, along with intransigent hostility to liberal critique per se, is what links together her choices from the Quadrant lineup. Both Brunton and Windschuttle have campaigned strenuously against pro-Aboriginal treatments of history; Brunton most visibly through the Hindmarsh Island case, Windschuttle ? with support from Albrechtsen ? in the output of his Macleay Press. It?s on this score that Senator Coonan should have brought in at least one real opponent, and there?s no shortage. Here again, the senator is marvellously deaf; Windschuttle?s version in particular has been systematically discredited from positions right across the range, from Martin Krygier?s gentle conservativism to the Green Left Weekly. Among much else, James Boyce?s long essay ?Fantasy Island? in Robert Manne?s collection Whitewash (Black Inc., 2003) surveys the great spread of evidence ignored by Windschuttle on the Aboriginal Tasmanians; he finds ?a view of the past disconnected from the lives of real people who lived in Van Diemen?s Land. ? Elsewhere in the same volume, the indigenous scholar Greg Lehman, speaking for his Tasmanian kind, offers the clearest brief indictment I?ve seen of the Windschuttle project: ?We aspire to ? a future for ourselves where conflict, racism and separatism might become just steps along the way to something much better. This future is not to be found in the pages of The Fabrication of Aboriginal History. All Windschuttle offers us is an ignoble death in the past. He is consumed by the absurd task of telling the dead how to die. ? As that book and others demonstrate, we do owe Windschuttle a debt. He has incited a whole expansion of necessary analysis, and compelled anti-racist intellectuals in all corners of the field to know better what we?re about. That, however, is no qualification for a share in governing the ABC. By ironic default, these appointments suggest that Aboriginal issues, especially questions of historical understanding, are not merely contentious; they are central to the imagined community, the nation. In the absence of clear and full acknowledgement, Aboriginal history threatens the over-cherished positions of Gallipoli, Anzac, masculine mateship and the rest of John Howard?s private gallery (never say the man lacks imagination). There is a fear of deep human difference, and an attendant fear of serious national responsibility. Those fears underlie much of the government?s broad self-protective agenda, its program for the ABC included. Here once more, the denial of Aboriginal claims works rather like a boomerang. Sent off repeatedly, they keep on coming back. ? Sylvia Lawson has published widely on culture and politics.
