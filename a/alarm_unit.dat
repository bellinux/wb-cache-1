50|$|A {{wireless}} bedwetting alarm is one {{in which}} the sensor and the <b>alarm</b> <b>unit</b> communicate by a means other than a wire. The transmitter, which senses the moisture, is directly attached to the child's underwear. The signal is transmitted wirelessly to a unit that is across the room from the child or an <b>alarm</b> <b>unit</b> in the child's room. Once the <b>alarm</b> <b>unit</b> is activated, it is necessary {{to get out of bed}} to turn it off. New wireless alarms add the convenience of also sounding an alarm in the caregiver's room, allowing both patient and caregiver to sleep in the comfort and privacy of their own beds and rooms. Multiple alarms in the house can further increase convenience. Remote controls can facilitate using the wireless bedwetting alarm system, and be especially convenient for the parent or caregiver.|$|E

40|$|The {{function}} of the Automatic Telephone Dialling System is to detect any sort of alarm such as fire, equipment failure, burglary. It then has to transmit the alarm information over the switched telephone network to a Control Station, where the alarm information is displayed. The attending personnel can then take the appropriate action. The Dialling system designed and constructed in this thesis consists of two parts: the <b>Alarm</b> <b>Unit</b> and the Control Station. As soon as an alarm occurs, the <b>Alarm</b> <b>Unit</b> selects the first available telephone number of the Control Station and dials the number. Using Frequency Shift Keying method, the <b>Alarm</b> <b>Unit</b> transmits the information identifying itself and the alarm to the Control Station. Initiate and Acknowledge Signalling as well as error checking ensure correct data transmission. Data re-transmissions and rediallings take place until successful transmission is acknowledged. A micro-program rather than a hardwired control logic is used in each the <b>Alarm</b> <b>Unit</b> and the Control Station for controlling their operations. The Central Processing Unit has been designed using MSI components. A microprocessor was not used because, {{at the time of}} the commencement of the project, its cost was high. Nevertheless the design was microprocessor - oriented, so that a microprocessor can be adopted in the future. A prototype was implemented using CMOS technology. This offers the advantages of lower power dissipation and higher noise immunity when compared with existing technologies such as TTL. Automatic gain control amplifiers and filters are used in the system to compensate for transmission line losses and reduce noise influence on information reception. Provision has been made so that, if a number of alarms occur at the same time at the <b>Alarm</b> <b>Unit,</b> they will be transmitted sequentially. At the Control Station, apart from displaying current alarm, memory space is provided for queueing the received alarms. System testing can be carried out at the push of a button from either the <b>Alarm</b> <b>Unit</b> or the Control Station. The test routine involves the same sequence of operations as in the case of an alarm, thus enhancing the thoroughness of the test. The system is expandable to any desired number of Alarm Units and Control Stations. With a system of this type, if one Control Station is busy, an a <b>Alarm</b> <b>Unit</b> can be programmed to attempt communicating with another Control Station...|$|E

40|$|Much {{work has}} been carried out into the {{operation}} of loudspeakers for use in audio applications. This thesis examines loudspeaker operation from an alternative point of view. For use in fire alarms, the loudspeaker is required to produce as much sound power as possible at a particular frequency whilst being as efficient as possible. The moving coil loudspeaker is used as a starting point due to its widespread use. Many papers describing its operation are available and as such is a good loudspeaker with which to examine modelling techniques. An impedance model of the moving coil loudspeaker is developed and shown to be a good simulation of its operation. The loudspeaker currently used in fire <b>alarm</b> <b>units</b> is the balanced armature loudspeaker. A lumped parameter model of this loudspeaker is developed using SIMULINK. Results from this simulation are compared with experimental measurements to verify the accuracy of the model. A new design of loudspeaker is then described. The modelling technique developed for the balanced armature loudspeaker is then applied to this design. The results again compare well to experimental measurements. The effect of varying the acoustic loading on each loudspeaker is considered along with an overview of the piezoelectric sounder. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the use of each loudspeaker in fire <b>alarm</b> <b>units</b> along with suggestions for possible design improvements implied by the models...|$|R

40|$|The human {{musculoskeletal}} system {{consists of the}} skeletal framework made up of bones. The muscles, tendons and ligaments bind and hold the bones in position {{and allow them to}} move. The joints of the human body possess limitations associated with their degrees of freedom. Once the appendages try to move outside these limits, they give way to various musculoskeletal problems, such as shoulder pain, pain in the elbow, back, limbs, waist and so on. Such problems appear gradually if the person assumes incorrect postures for a prolonged duration. To tackle problems associated with incorrect postures, certain training devices, braces and alarm systems are used to remind and prompt the person, to correct his posture. Most of the posture alert systems are associated with improper spinal column orientation. This project involves developing a Posture Training Device for the upper limbs of a human for minimizing the risks of musculoskeletal problems associated with the elbow joint. The device consists of two major modules viz. an angular calibration unit and an auditory <b>alarm</b> <b>unit.</b> The angular calibration unit is designed with focus on simplicity of its construction and ease of use by the subject.

30|$|State {{estimator}} {{is one of}} the key {{applications in}} energy management system (EMS). It serves as a vital module that validates the raw measurements from the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system and provides current system states for downstream applications in EMS [1, 2, 3]. Applications such as contingency analysis, voltage stability analysis, transient stability analysis, system <b>alarming,</b> <b>unit</b> commitment, are critical to provide power system operators situational awareness and useful control applications to manage the grid reliability. During a system event, operators need to monitor system vulnerability, diagnose the cause of event and take corrective actions based on such tools. Typically, iterative methods are used in a conventional state estimator, which uses the previous operating condition as the initial point for the next solution. However, a state estimator may not converge, especially during the stressed condition or system experiencing contingencies when the state estimator results are needed the most. Moreover, incorrect or biased estimates are more likely to occur when the system is overloading. As a result, even when the state estimator converges, erroneous assessment of the system state may be obtained [4].|$|R
40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. A sudden {{unexpected}} death during epilepsy (SUDEP) {{can occur}} to an unattended epilepsy sufferer. The cessation {{of heart and}} breathing activity is associated with SUDEP. Therefore, developing a heart and breathing monitoring system that could alarm when an epilepsy patient experiences cessation of heart or breathing activity is necessary. This system will assist healthcare providers {{to respond to the}} emergency and prevent sudden death. This collaborative project is to investigate the feasibility of developing a miniature, unobtrusive, and self-contained module that an epilepsy patient could wear in bed and a small bedside <b>alarm</b> <b>unit</b> intended to alert healthcare providers to prevent SUDEP. The wearable unit communicates wirelessly occurrences of breaths and heartbeats to the bedside unit. The bedside unit alerts upon cessation of heart or breathing activity. This project assumed that the monitor receives an input voltage from a small strip of piezoelectric film made of polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) attached to the patient???s chest. The PVDF sensor voltage changes in response both to the chest expansion and contraction of breathing and to the chest vibrations caused by heartbeats. In the first stage of this project, human subject recordings of PVDF, strain-gauge plethysmography (SPG),and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals were analyzed to determine how to design the signal processing needed to separate out individual breathing and heartbeat signals. Then, low-power analog, microcontroller, and wireless technologies were used to build a prototype of the wearable module to separate out the breathing and heartbeat signals, detect individual breaths and heartbeats, and telemeter the detected breaths and heartbeats to the bedside unit. A prototype of the bedside unit was built using similar technologies to receive the occurrences of heartbeats and breaths from the wearable module. This unit also calculates heart and breathing rates and determines whether or not to alarm if breaths or heartbeats cease or the wireless link fails to function. For convenience, the wearable module and bedside unit were prototyped using bread-boarded circuitry and commercial development boards containing the miniature electronic components. Once feasibility is shown, the wearable module and bedside unit can be compacted by incorporating the miniature electronic components directly into custom integrated circuits. The performance of the signal processing algorithm to separate out breathing and heartbeat signals and to detect individual breaths and heartbeats was tested by using the algorithm to process PVDF recordings from human subjects and comparing the results with SPG recordings of breaths and PPG recordings of heartbeats from the same human subjects. Miss Swetha Seshu Ayyagari designed the hardware for the signal conditioning circuit and the software for digital signal processing to separate out the breathing and heartbeat signals from the PVDF signal. Mr. Pritam Rajendra Chopda designed the software to detect individual breaths and heartbeats, transmit detected breaths and heartbeats to the bedside unit, calculate heart and breathing rate, and alert upon cessation of heartbeats or breathing or wireless link failure. Prototypes were successfully built of the wearable module and bedside unit. The prototype wearable module was capable of processing an incoming PVDF signal, separating out breathing and heartbeat signals, detecting individual breaths and heartbeats, and wirelessly transmitting them to the bedside unit. The prototype bedside unit was capable of alarming if breaths or heartbeats stopped or if the wireless link failed. On six 22 -s PVDF recordings, percentage of peaks correctly detected as breaths (true positive) is 64...|$|E
