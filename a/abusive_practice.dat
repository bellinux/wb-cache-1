5000|$|Another <b>abusive</b> <b>practice</b> that is penalized if {{discovered}} is {{the process}} of [...] "nerving" [...] the horse's tail. If a horse is bored and irritable, it will express its displeasure by swishing its tail vigorously. Horses who are shown too long and schooled too repetitively can become [...] "ring sour," [...] a term used to describe a horse with a bored, unhappy and irritable manner, and often a ring sour horse will flatten its ears and swish its tail every time it is given a command. Because tail swishing is penalized, some competitors resorted to cutting the nerves in a ring sour horse's tail to prevent the tail from moving. Because this also keeps the horse from brushing away flies, leaving it helpless against biting insects, the practice was quickly banned, and horses with nerved tails are no longer allowed in the show ring. However, some competitors still resort to temporarily numbing the tail with drugs, alcohol injections , or by mechanical means, also illegal if discovered but, as no scars remain, can be difficult to spot. The practice of nerving the tail was less of a problem in breeds where a high-carried tail is a breed trait, though temporarily numbing the tail is not completely unknown even in these breeds.|$|E

5000|$|... (I) [...] "Those {{who either}} {{publicly}} or privately teach or defend propositions condemned by the Holy See under pain of excommunication latae sententiae; likewise those who teach or maintain as lawful {{the practice of}} asking the penitent {{the name of his}} or her accomplice, a practice condemned by Benedict XIV in his Constitutions ‚ 'In Suprema Catholicæ' (July 7, 1745), `Ubi primum' (July 2, 1746), and `Ad eradicandam' (September 28, 1746)." [...] This article contains two distinct parts. In the first it is not question of all propositions condemned by popes or councils in terms less condemnatory (e.g. rash, offensive, etc.) than the specific stigma heretical (to defend heretical propositions being heresy itself and already declared a chief cause of excommunication, see above), but only those which the popes have specifically forbidden to be maintained under pain of excommunication latae sententiae. These propositions are: (a) the forty-one errors of Luther condemned by Leo X, May 16, 1520; (b) the seventy-nine theses of Michael Baius condemned October 1, 1567, January 29, 1579, and March 16, 1641; (c) the thesis on confession and absolution by letter or messenger, condemned by Clement VIII, June 20, 1602; (d) the twenty-eight propositions condemned by Alexander VII, September 24, 1665; (e) the seventeen propositions condemned by the same pope, March 18, 1666; (f) the sixty-five propositions condemned by Innocent XI, March 4, 1679; (g) the sixty-eight propositions of Miguel de Molinos condemned by the same pope, November 20, 1687; (h) the second of two propositions condemned by Alexander VIII, August 24, 1690; (i) the thirty-one propositions condemned by the same pope, December 7, 1690; (k) the five propositions on duelling condemned by Benedict XIV, November 10, 1752; (I) and finally the sixty-five Modernistic propositions condemned by decree of the Holy Office, July 3, 1907, according to the Motu Proprio of Pius X, November 19, 1907. The text of all these propositions will be found in Denzinger's [...] "Enchiridion Symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum", etc. (10th ed., Freiburg, 1908), also, the last series excepted, in Pennachi's [...] "Comment in Const. Apost. Sedis", I, 168. The second part of the article aims at the <b>abusive</b> <b>practice</b> of requiring the penitent, under pain of being refused absolution, to divulge the name of his or her accomplice in any crime, a dangerous practice and opposed to the conditions of secrecy under which sacramental confession is made. Benedict XIV denounced it, notably in Portugal, by the aforementioned Constitutions. It is to be noted, however, that this excommunication is not incurred by the confessor who asks a penitent the name of his or her accomplice, but only by him who teaches or maintains that this practice is permitted. Moreover, the expression [...] "to teach or maintain" [...] implies more than merely to affirm or share the condemned opinions.|$|E

The study aimed to determine whether staff working in residential care for the elderly could identify insidiously abusive care practice, and whether this could be predicted by staff attitudes towards older people or work locus of control.

Results indicated that staff had more positive attitudes towards older people than negative attitudes, and that negative attitudes alone were the greatest significant predictor of staff identification of abuse, i. e. greater negative attitudes were {{associated with}} poorer recognition of abuse. 65 % of participants were able to identify insidiously abusive care practice, suggesting that a significant proportion (35 %) of participants were not. It was hypothesised that negative attitudes reflected a paternalistic approach to care rather than intentionally <b>abusive</b> <b>practice.</b> There was some indication that abuse-related training may moderate the relationship between negative attitude and recognition of abuse, but that training alone does not improve recognition of abuse. These hypotheses require further testing...|$|E

40|$|Despite concerted {{efforts to}} combat human trafficking, {{the trade in}} persons {{persists}} and, in fact, continues to grow. This article suggests that a central reason for the limited success in preventing human trafficking is the dominant conception of the problem, which forms the basis for law developed to combat human trafficking. Specifically, the author argues that 2 ̆ 2 otherness 2 ̆ 2 is a root cause of both inaction and the selective nature of responses to the <b>abusive</b> <b>practice</b> of human trafficking. Othering operates across multiple dimensions, including race, gender, ethnicity, class, caste, culture, and geography, to reinforce a conception of a virtuous 2 ̆ 2 Self 2 ̆ 2 and a devalued 2 ̆ 2 Other. 2 ̆ 2 This article exposes how this Self/Other dichotomy shapes the phenomenon of human trafficking, driving demand for trafficked persons, influencing perceptions of the problem, and constraining legal initiatives to end the abuse. By examining human trafficking through an otherness-aware framework, this article aims to elucidate {{a deeper understanding of}} human trafficking and offer a prescription for reducing the adverse effects of otherness on both efforts to combat human trafficking and the individuals that now suffer such abuses...|$|E
40|$|The {{branding}} {{of children}} as ‘witches’, capable of harming others {{is a widespread}} practice in some countries in Africa and across the world. There is evidence of this within specific communities and faith groups; however, {{the extent to which}} this phenomenon occurs in England is unclear as is the response by childcare professionals, statutory agencies and Voluntary Organisations. Between 2000 and 2010, at least six children lost their lives {{in different parts of the}} UK following periods of abuse, neglect and trauma linked to what is now known as abuse arising from being labelled ‘witches’. Each of these children, died because their parent or carer believed that they were responsible for ill luck, ill fortune and/or ill health that had befallen them and/or members of their families. Drawing upon a children's rights framework, this paper aims to provide a critical examination of child abuse that is caused by a belief that children can and are ‘witches’ or possess some evil spirits, making them capable of causing harm and discord within a family. Existing literature will be interrogated to provide some background and a historical context to this alarming and <b>abusive</b> <b>practice...</b>|$|E
40|$|Emergency {{ordinances}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} controversial issues in our political and constitutional system as the current constitutional stipulations are not able to stop the Governments’ <b>abusive</b> <b>practice</b> of passing this type of ordinances. During the 25 years of existence of the present Constitution, 2, 850 emergency ordinances have been issued, an average of one emergency ordinance every three days. The exaggerated number of emergency ordinances affects the quality, the stability and the predictability of the legislative process, as well as the relation between the legislative power and the executive power. When revising the Constitution in 2003, new stipulations regarding the use of emergency ordinances have been introduced in order to limit the Governments’ discretionary practice, but they proved to be insufficient. Since the real emergency situations already have legislative solutions, on the occasion of a new revision of the Constitution, the emergency ordinances should either be removed from the Constitution (in correlation with the extension of the legal legislative delegation during the parliamentary sessions and the revision of the organic laws regime) or they should be maintained, subject to repeal if they are not converted into law within 60 days from their adoption (as in the Italian model). We support, with arguments, the first option of constitutional reform. </p...|$|E
