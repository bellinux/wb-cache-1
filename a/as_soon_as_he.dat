5|$|Brezhnev's {{stabilisation}} policy included ending the liberalising reforms of Khrushchev, and clamping down on cultural freedom. During the Khrushchev years, Brezhnev had supported the leader's denunciations of Stalin's arbitrary rule, {{the rehabilitation of}} many of the victims of Stalin's purges, and the cautious liberalisation of Soviet intellectual and cultural policy. But <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> became leader, Brezhnev began to reverse this process, and developed an increasingly conservative and regressive attitude.|$|E

He decided to return to a theme for which he had created a sketch in 1820, that of the story of Pandora and in particular the passage in Hesiod in which the seasons crown her with a wreath. He had exhibited a sketch in 1820 on the same theme, and had already decided on the arrangement of the figures. His first attempt in 1824 was abandoned half-finished, and he began again on a smaller canvas with different positioning of the key figures of Pandora, Vulcan and Venus.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> took office, Meyszner {{embarked}} on a thorough re-organisation of all police operations in the occupied territory.

He took under his command {{the forces of the}} Serbian puppet government, known as the Serbian State Guard, and also established a number of auxiliary and volunteer police units across the whole territory. One of the units controlled by Meyszner was the Auxiliary Police Troop, recruited from Russian Volksdeutsche from the occupied territory but also from Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania and trained by the Orpo. It was planned to reach a strength of 400 men but little is known about its activities.|$|E
5|$|At {{that first}} meeting on 28 January 1981, which lasted over seven hours, Heidemann offered Kujau a deposit of only 100,000DMs to agree the deal, which Kujau did not accept.

Kujau tentatively agreed to provide the diaries and told Heidemann that he would call him <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could arrange to receive them from East Germany. As a sign of good faith Heidemann lent the uniform to the forger, to show alongside his collection of other uniforms from the top Nazis; for his part, Kujau gave the journalist a painting purportedly by Hitler. Both the painting and uniform were fakes.|$|E

5|$|Bayona {{cut parts}} of the script, {{including}} {{the outcome of the}} other orphanage children, because he wanted to focus on the character of Laura and what happens to her. To create the film as he wanted, Bayona had to double both the film's budget and the amount of filming time. To accomplish this, Bayona received help from fellow film director Guillermo del Toro, whom he had met at Festival de Cine de Sitges when del Toro was presenting his film Cronos (1993). Del Toro offered to co-produce the film <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> learned about it.

Ultimately Pope Innocent III on 28April 1199 ordered that Geoffrey was to be restored to his lands <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had paid his debts to the king.

Although the barristers on both sides were noted for their skill the case went almost entirely one way, with the jury taking only ten minutes to find Booth guilty. This was one of the first noted cases of Patrick Hastings, and his victory in it led to him applying to become a King's Counsel.|$|E
