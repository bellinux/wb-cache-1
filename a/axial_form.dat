A similar idea was the swashplate engine, an <b>axial</b> <b>form</b> of cam engine.

40|$|The <b>axial</b> <b>forming</b> {{process is}} a method of cold metal forming, which {{is used for the}} {{production}} of axially symmetric profiles and retractions at full and hollow components. Furthermore, the method-sided retractions, material accumulations together with external and internal profiles are produced by incremental forming technology. As an example for external teeth, a strip wounded forming cavity (die) with an alternating kinematic is driven through the work piece and thereby generating the teeth. This specific feature of <b>axial</b> <b>forming</b> is realized by an oscillating tool feed movement. There is no material loss, e. g. gearings can be generated in net-shape-quality by forming operations. In consequence of parallel force reduction, it is also possible to handle thin or slim structures and for instance to equip with an internal or external teeth without causing bending or buckling. A special challenge of the simulative illustration of the process is the connection of the recursive tool kinematic with the friction model.

40|$|The {{strange quark}} {{contribution}} to the vector and <b>axial</b> <b>form</b> factors of the nucleon has been determined for momentum transfers in the range 0. 45 < Q 2 < 1. 0 GeV 2. The results are obtained via a combined analysis of forward-scattering, parity-violating elastic ep asymmetry data from the G 0 and HAPPEx experiments at Jefferson Lab, and elastic νp and ¯νp scattering data from Experiment 734 at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The parity-violating asymmetries measured in elastic ep scattering at forward angles establish {{a relationship between the}} strange vector form factors Gs E and GsM, with little sensitivity to the strange <b>axial</b> <b>form</b> factor GsA. On the other hand, elastic neutrino scattering at low Q 2 is dominated by the <b>axial</b> <b>form</b> factor, with some significant sensitivity to the vector form factors as well.

40|$|We {{study the}} weak {{interaction}} <b>axial</b> <b>form</b> factors of the octet baryons, within the covariant spectator quark model, {{focusing on the}} dependence of four-momentum transfer squared, Q^ 2. In our model the <b>axial</b> <b>form</b> factors G_A(Q^ 2) (axial-vector form factor) and G_P(Q^ 2) (induced pseudoscalar form factor), are calculated based on the constituent quark <b>axial</b> <b>form</b> factors and the octet baryon wave functions. The quark axial current is parametrized by the two constituent quark form factors, the axial-vector form factor g_A^q(Q^ 2), and the induced pseudoscalar form factor g_P^q(Q^ 2). The baryon wave functions are composed of a dominant S-state and a P-state mixture for the relative angular momentum of the quarks. First, we study in detail the nucleon case. We assume that the quark axial-vector form factor g_A^q(Q^ 2) has the same function form {{as that of the}} quark electromagnetic isovector form factor. The remaining parameters of the model, the P-state mixture and the Q^ 2 -dependence of g_P^q(Q^ 2), are determined by a fit to the nucleon <b>axial</b> <b>form</b> factor data obtained by lattice QCD simulations with large pion masses. In this lattice QCD regime the meson cloud effects are small, and the physics associated with the valence quarks can be better calibrated. Once the valence quark model is calibrated, we extend the model to the physical regime, and use the low Q^ 2 experimental data to estimate the meson cloud contributions for G_A(Q^ 2) and G_P(Q^ 2). Using the calibrated quark <b>axial</b> <b>form</b> factors, and the generalization of the nucleon wave function for the other octet baryon members, we make predictions for all the possible weak interaction <b>axial</b> <b>form</b> factors G_A(Q^ 2) and G_P(Q^ 2) of the octet baryons. The results are compared with the corresponding experimental data for G_A(0), and with the estimates of baryon-meson models based on SU(6) symmetry.
