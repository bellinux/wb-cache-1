2500|$|... 27 February 1976: Harold Blair (aged 51), a Protestant {{employee}} of the Northern Ireland Electricity Company was wounded when he triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb in a derelict house on Landseer Street, Belfast. An electricity meter-reader, Blair accidentally triggered the <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device</b> on a bomb hidden in the meter box. It is believed a British foot-patrol was the intended target. Blair died the following day, 28 February.|$|E

50|$|The {{problem of}} UXBs was further {{complicated}} when Royal Engineer bomb disposal personnel began to encounter munitions fitted with <b>anti-handling</b> <b>devices</b> e.g. the Luftwaffe's ZUS40 anti-removal bomb fuze of 1940. Bomb fuzes incorporating <b>anti-handling</b> <b>devices</b> were {{specifically designed to}} kill bomb disposal personnel. Scientists and technical staff responded by devising methods and equipment to render them safe, including the work of Eric Moxey.|$|R
5000|$|FFV 028 SD - Version {{fitted with}} a {{ball-bearing}} based <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device.</b> The mine self-destructs after between 30 and 180 days ...|$|E
5000|$|Of the {{two types}} of pressure-fuze {{available}} for Teller mines, the T.Mi.Z.43 fuze was notable for featuring an integral <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device</b> as standard: when the T.Mi.Z.43 fuze is inserted and the pressure plate (or screw cap) is screwed down into place, it shears a weak arming pin inside the fuze with an audible [...] "snap". This action arms the <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device.</b> Thereafter, any attempt to disarm the mine by unscrewing the pressure plate (or screw cap) to remove the fuze will automatically release the spring-loaded firing pin inside it, triggering detonation.|$|E
50|$|The bomb {{contained}} a new, unrecognised type of fuse, which contained both an <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device</b> and booby trap. No exiting disarming techniques or equipment {{could deal with}} the fuse mechanism.|$|E
50|$|The mine {{could be}} {{fitted with a}} number of improvised <b>anti-handling</b> <b>devices</b> {{utilizing}} the MUV pull fuze.|$|R
50|$|The {{mine was}} {{normally}} employed in minefields mixed with metal-cased anti-tank mines. The mines were also easy to fit with <b>anti-handling</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|Caps {{are used}} in cartridges, grenades, rocket-propelled grenades, and rescue flares. Percussion caps are also used in land mine fuzes, boobytrap firing <b>devices</b> and <b>anti-handling</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|A self {{neutralizing}} {{period of}} between 1 and 128 days can be selected. The mine's status {{can also be}} checked remotely. It has provision for the fitting of an <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The T.Mi.Z.43 {{pressure}} fuze can {{be fitted}} to Tellermine 42s. The T.Mi.Z.43 fuze is notable for featuring an integral <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device</b> as standard: when the fuze is inserted {{and the pressure}} plate screwed down into place, it shears a weak arming pin in the fuze with an audible [...] "snap". This action arms the <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device.</b> Thereafter, any attempt to disarm the mine by unscrewing the pressure plate (to remove the fuze) will automatically trigger detonation. Since {{it is impossible to}} determine which fuze type has been installed, no pressure plate should ever be removed from a Tellermine ...|$|E
50|$|The mine {{is found}} in the Falkland Islands and the Western Sahara. An {{electronically}} fuzed version of this mine (the SB-81/AR-AN) was also produced which featured an integral <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device</b> plus self-destruct capability.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: M4 anti tank mine, showing main fuze in the centre, plus 2 {{additional}} fuze pockets (both empty) {{which provide}} {{the option to}} fit <b>anti-handling</b> <b>devices</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{different}} classes of <b>anti-handling</b> <b>devices</b> are normally created {{using a variety}} of fuzes. This is a list of the types of fuzes used as anti-handling devices: ...|$|R
5000|$|The treaty covers only anti-personnel mines; it {{does not}} address mixed mines, {{anti-tank}} mines, remote-controlled claymore mines, <b>anti-handling</b> <b>devices</b> (booby traps), and other [...] "static" [...] explosive devices.|$|R
50|$|The mine is {{sensitive}} to disturbance, and possibly to the signals generated by mine detectors, recent modifications to the mine have reported desensitised it. However it still features a motion sensitive <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Section of an {{anti-tank}} mine. Note {{the yellow}} main charge {{wrapped around a}} red booster charge, and the secondary fuze well {{on the side of}} the mine designed for an <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The mine arms itself {{after an}} initial delay of ten minutes and self-neutralizes after 30 days. It also {{incorporates}} an <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device,</b> which is sensitive to motion and the signals produced by mine detectors.|$|E
50|$|To hinder demining, all Teller mines {{featured}} {{two additional}} fuze wells (located {{on the side}} and underneath) to enable <b>anti-handling</b> <b>devices</b> to be attached, typically some form of pull-fuze.|$|R
50|$|The mine can be {{used with}} several <b>anti-handling</b> <b>devices</b> {{including}} an anti-lifting plate underneath the mine, and a device that connects the opening of the top of the mine to the fuze.|$|R
50|$|A {{tilt switch}} can trigger a bomb. Mercury tilt {{switches}} {{can be found}} in some bomb and landmine fuzes, typically in the form of <b>anti-handling</b> <b>devices,</b> for example, a variant of the VS-50 mine.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{version of}} the SB-33 called the SB-33AR (AR {{standing}} for Anti-Rimozione, [...] "Counter-Removal") exists. It looks identical to the standard SB-33 mine. However, the SB-33AR has an integral <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device</b> specifically designed to injure deminers. The <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device</b> in an SB-33AR consists of a mercury tilt switch and battery connected to the detonator. When an SB-33AR is moved a few degrees from the horizontal (i.e. when a deminer lifts it), it detonates, blowing the victim's hand off. Generally, {{a small number of}} SB-33AR landmines would be sown inside a minefield containing standard SB-33 mines in order to hinder and deter any attempt to conduct demining operations.|$|E
5000|$|... 70 fuze - <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device</b> (i.e. boobytrap) will trigger {{detonation}} if {{the bomb}} is moved after impact with the ground. The fuze is armed if 3 screw threads {{at the base}} of the arming spindle are visible.|$|E
50|$|The mine has {{a central}} tube in the bottom, which can either accept an {{electric}} command detonator or a wire, which {{is attached to}} the pressure plunger. The wire can anchored, allowing it to act as an <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
50|$|Generally, the render safe {{procedure}} for VS-50 mines with <b>anti-handling</b> <b>devices</b> fitted is to detonate them in situ via a donor charge, or burn through the plastic casing using {{some form of}} special incendiary device.|$|R
50|$|<b>Anti-handling</b> <b>devices</b> {{prevent the}} capture and reuse of the munition by enemy forces. They also hinder bomb {{disposal}} or demining operations, both directly and by deterrence, thereby creating {{a much more}} effective hazard or barrier.|$|R
50|$|Building {{obstacles}} {{to prevent the}} enemy from moving around the battlefield. Destroying bridges, blocking roads, creating airstrips, digging trenches, etc. Can also include planting land mines and <b>anti-handling</b> <b>devices</b> when authorized and directed to do so.|$|R
50|$|Three {{variants}} {{of the mine}} exist: one with a magnetic fuse which detonates upon magnetic influence, one with a self-extending tilt rod fuse, and another with a contact baffle. In addition, the magnetic fuse mine has an <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The mine is {{triggered}} by {{pressure on the}} lid forcing the retaining pin out of the striker which then hits the detonator. It {{can be used with}} a tripwire connected to the fuze acting as a crude <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
50|$|Once {{deployed}} {{the mine}} arms itself after sixty seconds. The mine uses a magnetic influence fuze that detonates the mine when a vehicle passes over it. It is also {{reported to have}} an <b>anti-handling</b> <b>device</b> which is sensitive to movement.|$|E
50|$|Note: some fuzes, e.g. {{those used}} in air-dropped bombs and landmines may contain <b>anti-handling</b> <b>devices</b> {{specifically}} designed to kill bomb disposal personnel. The technology to incorporate booby-trap mechanisms in fuzes has existed since at least 1940 e.g. the German ZUS40 anti-removal bomb fuze.|$|R
5000|$|The mine is also {{fitted with}} two {{secondary}} fuze wells which allow <b>anti-handling</b> <b>devices</b> to be fitted e.g. the M1 pull fuze or M5 [...] "mouse-trap" [...] anti-lift fuze. Either {{or both of}} the secondary fuze wells on an M19 mine may be fitted with an antihandling device.|$|R
50|$|Downward {{pressure}} on the spider presses down {{on the head of}} the fuze, breaks a shear pin, and inverts a belleville spring, flipping the striker downwards into a stab sensitive detonator, triggering the mine. The M4 version of the mine has two secondary fuze wells so that <b>anti-handling</b> <b>devices</b> can be fitted.|$|R
