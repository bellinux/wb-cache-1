40|$|M. Tech. (Civil Engineering) Recoverable <b>anchor</b> <b>screws</b> {{are widely}} used in the {{construction}} of massive concrete structures such as dams, channels, tunnels and multi-story buildings to fix temporary cantilever forms. Attempts have been made before to quantify the failure capacities of recoverable <b>anchor</b> <b>screws.</b> However, such tests were conducted and reported on more than 25 years ago and were limited to a small number of tests on concrete strengths not exceeding 20 MPa, whereas most concrete constructions now exceed such strengths. The aim of this dissertation was to review the existing theories on the use of concrete anchors in practice and to apply the appropriate theories to recoverable <b>anchor</b> <b>screws.</b> In doing so, the overall shear strength of these screws was determined by considering existing theoretical standards and norms, and by testing the tensile capacity in the laboratory. The failure behaviour of recoverable <b>anchor</b> <b>screws</b> in various concrete strengths and construction applications is reviewed and is discussed based on both theory and the laboratory results obtained.

Between the 1850s through 1890s, more than 100 screw-pile lighthouses were erected on the east coast of the United States using screw piles. Made originally from cast or wrought iron, they had limited bearing and tension capacities. Modern screw pile load capacities are in excess of 2000 kN. Large load capacity screw piles may have various components such as flat half helices, Bisalloy cutting tips and helices, cap plates or re-bar interfaces for connection to various concrete or steel structures.|$|R

The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation drop test specifies that when multi-pitch lead climbing and the leader has only placed one screw (typically merely clipping one of the <b>anchor</b> <b>screws)</b> before climbing up a couple of meters and falling (a fall factor of 2), the screw must hold.

Patients and methodsTwenty three patients were operated on by the same surgeon between January 1999 and December 2006 and prospectively followed up to a mean 4 ½ years (range, 2 – 10 yrs). A Collégia™ cup (Wright Medical France, Créteil, France) was impacted in 23 total hip arthroplasty acetabular component revisions, including 17 cases of SOFCOT grade- 1 bone-stock loss and six of grade 2. ResultsThere were six clinically poor results on the Merle D’Aubigné scale. One case of early migration occurred, in a multioperated acetabulum. There was one isolated dislocation and one recurrent dislocation associated with loose greater trochanter nonunion, but tolerated as it was infrequent. DiscussionThis option simplifies revision surgery and limits the risk of dislocation if the abductor muscles unit is continuous. It is indicated when local bone-site compromise encompass a wall-contained cavitary defect at most.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background. Orthognathic surgery means {{surgical}} {{correction of}} dentofacial and congenital deformities, which includes unsatisfactory facial aesthetics, malpositioned teeth, jaw malformations and masticatory dysfunction. Correction {{of these conditions}} requires a multidisciplinary approach {{with a combination of}} orthodontics and surgery. Successful outcome of orthognathic treatment requires pre-, intra- and postoperative considerations with a multimodal approach in order to minimize morbidity and enhance recovery after surgery. Developments within the orthognathic field should focus on multimodal approaches with combined effects of modern anaesthetic protocols, minimal invasive surgery and pharmacological modification of inflammatory responses. However, surgical morbidity after orthognathic surgery is still associated with undesirable sequelae such as damage to teeth, facial oedema, pain, neurosensory disturbances, prolonged recovery time and removal of titanium plates. Intraoperative anchorage of the occlusion is a major keystone in the implementation of the orthognathic planning during surgery. Bone <b>anchor</b> <b>screws</b> are therefore occasionally required in transalveolar positions as reinforced rigid emergency anchor for proper intermaxillary fixation in cases when orthodontic appliances loosen or when preoperative orthodontic treatment isn´t indicated. Furthermore, steroids are recommended to reduce swelling, pain, nausea and vomiting (PONV) and may promote nerve healing after surgery. The multimodal effects of steroids needs further investigation, thus the optimal dosages and the timing of administration is of great interest. Moreover, removal of inserted titanium fixation plates after surgery occur due to plate related complications. The reason for plate removal needs further investigation. Finally, different general anaesthetic protocols influence haemodynamics and subsequently postoperative pain, recovery and hospitalization. It is needed to understand the recovery process and to promote mobilization of the patient after surgery. Objectives. The aim of the first study was to evaluate two types of surgical techniques for insertion of bone <b>anchor</b> <b>screws</b> for intermaxillary fixation, regarding frequency of iatrogenic dental root injuries. The second trial investigated the efficacy of single versus repeated betamethasone doses on facial oedema, pain and neurosensory disturbances after bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO). The main objective of the third study was to investigate the incidence and reasons for removal of titanium fixation plates following orthognathic surgery, identify risk factors predisposing removal and to explore if the patients discomfort was reduced after removal. The primary objective of the fourth study was to evaluate haemodynamics and recovery parameters in relation to two general anaesthetic protocols; remifentanil-propofol based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) versus fentanyl-sevoflurane based balanced inhalation anaesthesia (BA) in orthognathic surgery. The second objective was to evaluate long duration local anaesthesia on recovery parameters and hospitalization. Material & Methods. Study I: Two surgical techniques were compared retrospectively (n= 123). Study II: Two study groups and a control group were compared with a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Repeated dose (4 + 8 + 4 mg betamethasone, n= 14), single dose (16 mg betamethasone, n= 11) and controls (n= 12). Study III: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed (n= 404) and additionally a questionnaire was used. Totally 323 (80 %) patients responded the questionnaire and were subsequently included in the study. Study IV: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed (n= 269). Ninety-four patients were audited due to strict inclusion criteria. Results. The first study revealed that the twist drill was hazardous in transalveolar positions since it could cause iatrogenic dental root injuries (p< 0. 001). The second study showed that steroids inhibited progression of facial oedema the first day after surgery (p= 0. 017). However, steroids did not reduce neurosensory disturbances over time. Reduced bleeding was associated with improved pain recovery over time (p= 0. 043). Patients requiring higher dosages of analgesics due to pain had significantly delayed recovery regarding neurosensory disturbances (p< 0. 001). The third study revealed that smoking, osteotomies performed in the mandible and additional number of inserted fixation plates resulted in more plate removal. A majority of the patients were relieved from plate related complications after plate removal. In the fourth study {{no significant differences between the}} two anaesthetic protocols were found regarding: blood loss, operating time, recovery time, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and hospitalization. Remifentanil-propofol based TIVA facilitated haemodynamic stability. Long duration local anaesthetics (ropivacaine 7. 5 mg/ml) administered at the end of surgery appeared to improve mobilization of the patient and reduce hospitalization. Conclusions. Morbidity was reduced when the twist drill was avoided prior the insertion of bone <b>anchor</b> <b>screws</b> in transalveolar positions. Steroids reduced facial oedema. The need for fixation plate removal was reduced when the numbers of inserted plates were minimized and smoking arrest was emphasized. Recovery from pain was enhanced when blood loss was minimized.

40|$|SummaryContextRotator cuff {{tears are}} very common. In 2005, about 45   000 {{patients}} in France underwent surgery. Surgical techniques and indications have evolved over recent {{years with the}} development of arthroscopic procedures. The lack of visibility on current practice and a request by the French Ministry of Health to assess the fixation devices used in arthroscopic surgery prompted the drafting of these guidelines. ObjectivesTo produce guidelines on the indications and limitations of open surgery and arthroscopic surgery. MethodsA systematic review of the literature (2000 – 2007) was performed. It was submitted to a multidisciplinary working group of experts in the field (n= 12) who drafted an evidence report and clinical practice guidelines, which were amended in the light of comments from 36  peer reviewers. Main recommendations(i) Medical treatment (oral medication, injections, physiotherapy) is always the first option in the management of degenerative tears of rotator cuff tendons. Surgery is a later option that depends on clinical and morphological factors, and patient characteristics. (ii) Surgery can be considered for the purpose of functional recovery in cases of a painful, weak or disabling shoulder refractory to medical treatment. (iii) Arthroscopy is indicated for non-reconstructive surgery or debridement, and for partial tear debridement or repair. (iv) Open surgery, mini-open surgery or arthroscopy can be used for a full-thickness tear accessible to direct repair by suture. (v) A humeral prosthesis or total reversed prosthesis is indicated for cuff tear arthropathy. (vi) The fixation devices used for bone reinsertion (<b>anchors,</b> <b>screws,</b> staples, and buttons) are indispensable for fully arthroscopic repair.

PMMA-injectable screws (Fig.  6) provided with multiple holes at the distal {{part of the body}} are indicated whenever {{there is a need to}} increase the <b>screw</b> <b>anchoring</b> within the distal bone such as in severely osteoporotic patients.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Internal {{fixation}} {{has been}} shown to successfully prevent recurrent dislocations after fractures of the glenoid rim. With regards to fixation either suture <b>anchors</b> or <b>screws</b> can be used, depending on the fragment size. Complications regarding suture anchors and their management have been described previously but not the arthroscopic management of screw impingement. Case Report: We present a case of a 70 year old women who suffered from limited range of motion after fixation of a Ideberg III fracture using cannulated screws. X-rays showed one of the screws to be proud. The proud screw could be successfully removed arthroscopically resulting in an improved range of motion, function and decreased pain. Conclusion: Our report describes a possible technique for performing a procedure arthroscopically that used to be done as an open procedure before and highlights it’s limitations...|$|R
50|$|New Zealand greenshell mussel {{cultivation}} {{began in}} the 1970s and has since undergone massive expansion, with production growth of 708% from 1988 to 2000 (an average annual growth of 18%). Initial farms {{were based on the}} 700-year-old European floating raft method of mussel cultivation which was suitable at small scales; however, methods to support larger scale production were soon needed. An adaption of the Japanese longline shellfish aquaculture system led to the methods used today for commercial greenshell aquaculture and facilitated the transition to large-scale production by incorporating mechanized harvesting. This adaptation of the Japanese longline method consists of a series of large plastic buoys connected by two ropes forming a backbone which is held in place by concrete anchor blocks or steel <b>anchors</b> <b>screwed</b> into the seabed. Once the spat have been transported from the beach to mussel farms around the country, they are transferred into a stocking that holds the spat-covered seaweed material around a “dropper rope” which is suspended in the water column hanging at regular intervals off the backbone ropes. Soon after, the stocking and seaweed rots away, leaving only the rope for the mussels to attach. Subsequent loss of spat from the dropper ropes is typically high, generally over 50% and as high as 95%. This loss is partly due to the secondary settlement behaviour of mussels, whereby the spat can release their point of attachment to the growing rope and exude a mucous “parachute” to help move to an alternative settlement site using water currents. This loss of spat from mussel farms is a significant problem for the industry. A 2007 study identified two stressors that reduce the retention of mussels on the rope; desiccation and starvation (both of which are experienced on the journey from where the spat are harvested to where they are farmed). Steps to reduce these stressors on the spat during transport could potentially improve retention rates.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the best manufacturing technology for fasteners {{was the subject of}} this work. Physical and numerical simulations were used to evaluate various technological variants. Possibility of application of new generation bainitic steels was considered, as well. Improvement of exploitation properties was the objective of the optimization having in mind tool wear and manufacturing costs as constraints. Several fasteners were investigated but results for three parts, including Allen <b>screw,</b> <b>screw</b> <b>anchors</b> used to carry concrete plates are presented as a case study. Industrial trials were performed and confirmed correctness of the designed manufacturing technology...|$|R
