5|$|The {{house was}} never to be a private {{residence}} <b>again.</b> <b>It</b> was offered for sale in 1929, {{and at a time}} when many country houses were being demolished was given a scrap value of £5,882.

5|$|The later Ming Dynasty/Qing Dynasty scholar Qian Zeng (1629–1699) held an old {{volume of}} Su's work, which he {{faithfully}} reproduced in a newly printed edition.

5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them <b>again.</b> <b>It</b> is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E

5|$|Against Surrey on August 6, King was overpowering <b>again.</b> <b>It</b> {{was in this}} {{match that}} King gave what Barker called his finest {{first-class}} performance ever. Batting first, he scored 98 runs in the Philadelphian's first innings before being run out, and he then took 3 for 89 in Surrey's reply. In the second innings, he made 113 not out and then took 3 for 98. Surrey lost the match by 110 runs. Apparently, King was so exhausted after his performance that he fell asleep during a speech by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Alverstone at a banquet after the match.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly <b>again.</b> <b>It</b> also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Maria {{moved to}} the {{northeast}} the official forecasts called for the storm to continue to weaken slowly but an interaction with an upper-level trough caused Maria to strengthen <b>again.</b> <b>It</b> was also predicted that the storm would rapidly become extratropical, but Maria retained tropical characteristics for 48hours longer than some forecasts indicated. Maria weakened into a tropical storm on September 9 before finally becoming extratropical about midway between the Azores and Newfoundland early on September 10.|$|E

5|$|On Beecham's {{return to}} England in 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert {{together}} that drew superlatives from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, {{declined to give}} him the unfettered control that he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor <b>again</b> <b>it</b> would be as a paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham, unwilling to be answerable to anybody, left the LPO and in 1946 founded a rival orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic (RPO).|$|E
5|$|The 1910Cuba hurricane, {{popularly known}} as the Cyclone of the Five Days, was an unusual and {{destructive}} tropical cyclone that struck Cuba and the United States in October1910. It formed in the southern Caribbean on October9 and strengthened as it moved northwestward, becoming a hurricane on October 12. After crossing the western tip of Cuba, it peaked in intensity on October16, corresponding to Category4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. That same day, the hurricane moved in a counterclockwise loop and hit Cuba <b>again.</b> <b>It</b> then tracked toward Florida, landing near Cape Romano. After moving through the state, it hugged {{the coast of the}} Southeastern United States on its way out to sea.|$|E

5|$|The Smithsonian {{recognized}} the locomotive's age in 1931, but, since the museum didn't have {{the funds to}} refurbish the locomotive for full operation <b>again,</b> <b>it</b> was decided to run the locomotive in place (with the driving wheels lifted off the rails using jacks) with compressed air. The museum borrowed an 1836 coach from the Pennsylvania Railroad to display on the track behind the newly rebuilt tender, and the locomotive's 100th birthday was officially celebrated on November 12, 1931. The locomotive's semi-operation was broadcast over the CBS radio network with Stanley Bell narrating the ceremonies for the radio audience.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opened in}} the United Kingdom at Rialto Theater in London 14 August 1975 and in the United States on 26 September at the UA Westwood in Los Angeles, California.
