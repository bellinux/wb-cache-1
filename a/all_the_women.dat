5|$|A second {{emigrant}} ship—the Kennersley Castle, a merchantman docked at Leith, near Edinburgh—was {{hired by}} MacGregor in October 1822, and left Leith on 22 January 1823 with almost 200 emigrants aboard. MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard {{to see that}} they were well quartered; to their delight, he announced that since this was the maiden emigrant voyage from Scotland to Poyais, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> and children would sail free of charge. The Cazique was rowed back to shore to rousing cheers from his colonists. The ship's captain Henry Crouch fired a six-gun broadside salute, hoisted the supposed flag of Poyais, then steered the ship out of port.|$|E
5|$|About 60 Gilbertese {{civilians were}} {{relocated}} to Fanning island in January 1957 on the copra ship Tungaru, and another 40 on the Tulgai the following month. By mid-March 44 Gilbertese men, 29 women and 56 children remained. By {{the end of}} April, 31 of the men, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> and children hadd been taken to Fanning Island by RAF Hastings. The civilians would remain there {{for the next three}} months, before returning to Christmas Island. During the later test series, the Gilbertese civilians remained on the island, marshalled in areas like the military personnel.|$|E
5|$|Durran's costumes {{also helped}} emphasise social {{rank among the}} {{different}} characters; Caroline Bingley for instance is introduced in an empire silhouetted dress, clothing that would have then been {{at the height of}} fashion. During her interview, Durran opined that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> wear white at the Netherfield Ball due to its contemporary popularity, an idea that Wright credits as his reason for hiring her. All of the costumes were handmade, as clothing was at the time. However, costumes and hairstyles were adjusted to appeal to contemporary audiences, sacrificing historical accuracy.|$|E

5|$|At the mall, Michael {{opens to}} the women about his {{discomfort}} with Jan. Among other things, he tells them Jan has been videotaping them having sex and watching it with him afterwards. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> assure Michael that Jan's behavior is not normal and urge {{him to get out}} of the relationship. He remains conflicted about what he should do about Jan, but at Phyllis's prompting he finally admits to himself that he wants to break up with her. Michael thanks them for their help by treating them to one item each at Victoria's Secret. On the drive back, Pam takes a step toward asserting herself by changing a flat tire on Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) car. At the office, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) sneaks in{{to the women}}'s bathroom and discovers a plush waiting room. The other men soon join him.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Big Butte Creek area for at least 8,000 years. The Klamath, Upper Umpqua, Takelma, and Latgawa tribes of Native Americans {{inhabited}} the watershed until they were driven out in the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s. On Christmas Eve, December 24, 1855, Captain E. A. Rice along with 34 other men attacked a Native American encampment near the creek's mouth. Eighteen Native American men were killed, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> and children were captured, and the camp was burned to the ground. Most were relocated to Indian reservations. Non-indigenous settlers first arrived in the early 1860s, and agriculture, ranching, and logging industries quickly developed. Big Butte Creek was named by early settlers for its close proximity to Mount McLoughlin (also known as Snowy Butte), as was nearby Little Butte Creek.|$|E
5|$|In April, Turner {{wrote in}} a self-congratulatory tone to Himmler's {{personal}} staff officer, SS-Obergruppenführer Karl Wolff, stating that he had already had all the available Jewish men killed and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> and children placed in the Sajmište concentration camp. He went on to claim that he had arranged, {{with the help of}} the SD, a gas van to clear the camp in a period of a fortnight to four weeks. Holocaust historian Christopher Browning considers this claim suspect, stating that Turner's reports about Jewish affairs were often inaccurate and self-serving in an attempt to ingratiate himself with Hitler and shore up his position. Browning's view is that a van was dispatched after regular requests from Belgrade for the remaining Jews to be deported directly, so that the local authorities could resolve the matter themselves. When the van arrived in Belgrade, Meyszner was kept informed, and Schäfer asked him for directions.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptians then {{proceeded}} towards {{the town of}} Polytsaravos and reached it on August 28. Awaiting them there were 2,000 Maniots behind their fortifications. The Maniots had chosen Polytsaravos as their position of defence as it was on high ground and was surrounded by rocky slopes. This would have meant that the Egyptians could have been stopped before {{they arrived at the}} town. As part of their defence plan the villages sent <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> and children to the mountains before improving the fortifications. As the Egyptians arrived at the walls, the Maniots sallied out and caught the Egyptians by surprise. The Egyptians, suffering losses, withdrew from Mani and back into the Laconian plain. The Egyptians had lost 400 men during the battle and the Maniots only lost 9. This was the last invasion launched against Mani.|$|E
5|$|The {{costs of}} keeping the women imprisoned in the tolbooth at Pittenweem were {{becoming}} prohibitive; on 12 August, after payment of five hundred marks, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> except Cornfoot were released on bail. In September Morton was summoned to give evidence to the Privy Council but he had fully regained his health and displayed no symptoms of being possessed. Adam was questioned by the Privy Council in October and freed. In November, Laing, Lawson, Horsefoot and Wallace were released after paying a fine of £8 each; but {{the last of the}} accused, Cornfoot, was kept in solitary confinement in the tolbooth by Cowper. One of the prison guards, who perhaps felt sorry for her, put her in a cell with a window low enough for her to escape so she also gained her freedom.|$|E
25|$|Callirrhoe was a Calydonian {{woman who}} scorned Coresus, a priest of Dionysus, who {{threatened}} to afflict <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> of Calydon with insanity (see Maenad). The priest {{was ordered to}} sacrifice Callirhoe but he killed himself instead. Callirhoe threw herself into a well which was later named after her.|$|E

25|$|Some episodes are {{especially}} interesting and display these social changes. An example is when <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> {{go on strike}} in a company {{because they are not}} happy with the rights they get within their union while the male director of the company frantically tries to solve the situation and realises he can do nothing without these women.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the protest}} in September, 28 people protested {{in the town}} of Buraida, holding {{placards}} asking about their relatives in prison and how long their sentences would be. Quickly, all of these people were arrested and eventually eleven were detained for committing forbidden acts. By 21 January, according to a report on CNN, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> arrested had been released.|$|E

25|$|Unwilling to {{surrender}} themselves to military authority {{most of the}} tribal warriors refused the offer of protection, leaving only about 75 men, plus <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> {{and children in the}} village. The men who remained were mostly too old or too young to hunt. Black Kettle flew an American flag, with a white flag tied beneath it, over his lodge, as the Fort Lyon commander had advised him. This was to show he was friendly and forestall any attack by the Colorado soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Although {{she never}} flew in space, Cobb, along with twenty-four other women, {{underwent}} physical tests {{similar to those}} taken by the Mercury astronauts {{with the belief that}} she might become an astronaut trainee. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> who participated in the program, known as First Lady Astronaut Trainees, were skilled pilots. Dr. Randy Lovelace, a NASA scientist who had conducted the official Mercury program physicals, administered the tests at his private clinic without official NASA sanction. Cobb passed all the training exercises, ranking in the top 2% of all astronaut candidates of both genders.|$|E
25|$|The {{conscience}} {{of time is}} specified as years and months well divided, with during the first ten days of the months a habit of eating coca (hayo). The next ten days are for working the farmfields and houses. The last ten days are described as time when people rest and the women live separately from the men; <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> together in one bohío and every man in his own. It is reported that {{in other parts of}} the New Kingdom of Granada, the division of time is different; the described ten day periods are longer and two months of the year are reserved for fasting (quaresma).|$|E
60|$|As {{she spoke}} those words, {{the traces of}} {{sickness}} seemed, for the moment, to disappear from her face; her eyes shone with a steady inner light; <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> warmed and brightened in the radiance of her own triumph--the triumph, trebly won, of carrying her point, of vindicating her integrity, and of matching Magdalen's incorruptible self-denial on Magdalen's own ground.|$|R

Such {{was the case}} of Technician Fourth Grade Carmen Contreras-Bozak who belonged to the 149th Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. The 149th Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) Post Headquarters Company was the first WAAC Company to go overseas, setting sail from New York Harbor for Europe on January 1943. The unit arrived in Northern Africa on January 27, 1943 and rendered overseas duties in Algiers within General Dwight D. Eisenhower's theater headquarters, T/4. Carmen Contreras-Bozak, a member of this unit, was the first Hispanic to serve in the U.S. Women's Army Corps as an interpreter and in numerous administrative positions.|$|E
25|$|When Rome {{suffered}} severe defeats in 396 BC, {{the tenth}} year of this war, the Romans resorted again to Camillus, {{who was named}} dictator for the first time. After defeating both Falerii and Capena at Nepete, Camillus commanded the final strike against Veii. He dug the soft ground below {{the walls and the}} Romans infiltrated through the city's sewage system effectively, defeating the enemy. Not interested in capitulation terms, but in Veii's complete destruction, the Romans slaughtered the entire adult male population and made slaves of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> and children. The plunder was large. For the battle, Camillus had invoked the protection of Mater Matuta extensively, and he looted the statue of Juno for Rome. Back in Rome, Camillus paraded on a quadriga, a four-horse chariot, and the popular celebrations lasted four days.|$|E
25|$|From the 1960s, but {{especially}} in the 1970s and 1980s, Anzac Day became increasingly controversial in both Australia and New Zealand. Protests against the Vietnam War were common Anzac Day occurrences during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1967, {{two members of the}} left-wing Progressive Youth Movement in Christchurch staged a minor protest at the Anzac Day ceremony, laying a wreath protesting against the Vietnam War. They were subsequently convicted of disorderly conduct. In 1978, a women's group laid a wreath dedicated to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> raped and killed during war, and movements for feminism, gay rights, and peace used the occasion to draw attention to their respective causes at various times during the 1980s. In the 1980s, Australian feminists used the annual Anzac Day march to protest against rape and violence in war and were banned from marching.|$|E
