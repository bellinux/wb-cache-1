Doctors were given a huge responsibility by making compulsory admission a medical procedure. The position of the so-called <b>aliéné</b> was ultimately the result of negotiations between the madman himself, his family, doctors and the government. To understand how coercion was inscribed in a reformatory movement that claimed a more humane and scientific approach to insanity I researched the various influences that were at play. Sources from the établissement des aliénés de Frères Alexiens de Louvain were used to study the position of the <b>aliéné</b> {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century. The compulsory admission forms and the data on the use of coercive tactics shed light on the hopeful reformation and its decline caused by low cure rates and a growing overpopulation of asylums. The relation between the government and the alienists was characterized by a complex balance between freedom and control. Families and doctors also had a relationship that was complicated because of mutual distrust. The position of the <b>aliéné</b> grows more complicated when we look at these influences. Most of the time, the mental patient was doomed to undergo the decisions made for him by his family, his doctor or the government. However, as specialized treatment, scientific study and government policy grew, the mental patient also became someone who would no longer be ignored. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{sources of}} fiscal {{history in the}} 17 th century France James Collins Contrary to the picture {{presented}} by J. R. Mallet (one accepted by most historians), direct taxation in Champagne (and France) doubled between 1625 and 1634. The Central Treasury budgets do not reflect this increase because {{almost all of it}} was paid to the officers. By 1634, the proposed levy for the liens of the officers (droits <b>aliénés)</b> represented a surtax of 88 % (14 million l.) on the regular direct taxes. In that year, the king abolished the droits and introduced intendants as regional overseers, thus transforming the manner in which France was governed. This dismantling of the fiscal system helped to create socio-economic situation in which a general revolt was possible because it alienated large segments of the royal administration The fiscal crisis of 1643 - 1648 merely brought things to a head and made evident the urgency of a solution to the problems created by the fiscal and administrative policy followed between 1616 and 1642. The king's reliance on the army and the intendants to govern and administer France meant that reform could only come from the center, so {{it is not surprising that}} the solution chosen in 1661 was a cameralist "police" state.

40|$|Different human {{activities}} {{have been observed}} and predicted to threat present-day and future patterns of biodiversity, with impacts ranging from global to local spatial scales. Anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity can be subdivided into two categories: impacts directly deriving from {{human activities}} and those mediated by other taxa, whose detrimental effect is however triggered and enhanced by human action. In particular, three major threats widely recognized {{as the most important}} factors affecting biological diversity were analyzed through different modelling approaches: climate change, habitat loss and degradation and invasive alien species. A first case study evaluated the effect of climate change on Mediterranean bird communities through the application of the SESAM framework to model species assemblages. The results highlighted how the effect of climate change on the studied communities may consist in a relevant alteration of their properties, although different modelling implementation leaded to different predicted pathways for these effects to be exerted. While predictions driven by abiotic factors alone suggested a prevalent increase of most of the constituent species distribution, the inclusion of macroecological constraints and assembly rules into the projections leaded to successfully capture dynamics related to interspecific interactions, and provided consistent outcomes with the current knowledge on the studied species. Such discrepancy highlighted the importance of comparing the outcomes of multiple modelling techniques to assess the conservation implications of climate change for species assemblages. The subsequent two case studies assessed the role of traditional forest management and wind farms industries in provoking habitat loss and degradation on vertebrate species in Central Italy. First, I tested the hypothesis that sustainable forest management mimics the dynamics of a natural forest succession more closely than does traditional forestry, causing a less severe long – term impact on the distribution of forest vertebrates. I proposed the first integration of the forest dynamic model “LANDIS – II” with species distribution models in a hybrid modeling framework. The framework was applied on four forest – specialist vertebrates (tiny salamander, slow worm, eurasian nuthatch, and Leisler’s bat) and included three components: Forest Dynamic Model (FDM), Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and Spatial Pattern Analysis (SPA). FDM was used to simulate spatially explicit patterns of forest succession for the current time and for 2050, imposing three alternative forestry scenarios. The simulated forest succession patterns were analyzed through SPA to calculate spatialized landscape metrics that were adopted as environmental predictors for SDMs. Landscape trajectories were calculated on current and future species distributions predicted with SDMs to evaluate the effect of alternative forestry practices on their extension and fragmentation. The results showed how forest management mainly affected the spatial configuration rather than the extension of the predicted species distributions. Sustainable forest management was more favorable than traditional forestry in increasing the extension and reducing the fragmentation of the studied species’ distributions. My results supported the conclusion that conservation – oriented forest management mimicked the dynamics of a natural forest succession more closely than did traditional practices, favoring elements, such as forest unevenness, species richness, aggregation of patches and variability in their distances, which emerged as fundamental characteristics for preserving the long – term persistence of forest vertebrates. To evaluate the potential detrimental effect of wind turbines on bats, a regional-scale model was developed to assess the wind farm impact on bat migration and commuting routes. The model was implemented for the bat Nyctalus leisleri in a region of Central Italy currently undergoing considerable wind farm development. A Species Distribution Model for N. leisleri was generated using the MAXENT algorithm based on 47 presence records (reduced to 19 after the autocorrelation procedure) and 10 environmental variables derived from topographic and land cover maps. The SDM was used to create a map of connectivity using the software UNICOR to identify potential commuting corridors (PCCs). The incidence of each wind farm on bat flight corridors was assessed by overlaying the existing (380) and planned (195) turbine locations onto the PCCs. The results reported that most of the corridors were concentrated {{in the western part of}} the region, which hosts the largest suitable areas for the species; most of the existing (54 %) and planned (72 %) wind farms interfered with important corridors connecting the western and the eastern parts of the region. The last two case studies analysed the impacts related to Invasive Alien Species (IAS) on different vertebrate species at different geographical scales, both emphasizing the relevant role of an appropriate level of knowledge to cope with this critical threat to biodiversity. The realized climatic niche of an invasive species can be used to predict its potential distribution in new areas, providing a basis for screening procedures in the compilation of black and white lists to prevent new introductions. I tested this assertion by modelling the realized climatic niche of the Eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). MAXENT was used to develop three models: one considering only records from the native range (NRM), a second including records from native and invasive range (NIRM), a third calibrated with invasive occurrences and projected in the native range (RCM). Niche conservatism was tested considering both a niche equivalency and a niche similarity test. The results showed that NRM failed to predict suitable parts of the currently invaded range in Europe, while RCM underestimated the suitability in the native range. NIRM accurately predicted both the native and invasive range. The niche equivalency hypothesis was rejected due to a significant difference between the grey squirrel’s niche in native and invasive ranges. The niche similarity test yielded no significant results. My analyses supported the hypothesis of a shift in the species’ climatic niche in the area of introductions and leaded to the conclusion that SDMs appear to be a useful tool in the compilation of black lists, allowing identifying areas vulnerable to invasions. However, I advise caution in the use of SDMs based only on the native range of a species for the compilation of white lists for other geographic areas, due to the significant risk of underestimating its potential invasive range. The usefulness of SDMs for the assessment of IAS risk of spread also emerged from the analysis of the potential distribution of the rose-ringed parakeet and the monk parakeet in Central Italy. Psittaciformes play a predominant role among the exotic species deliberately imported by humans all over the world, being the most popular bird pets. When released, they often establish naturalized populations, as they present a wide ecological plasticity and synanthropy. The final case study aimed to statistically reconstruct the actual extent of occurrence (EOO) of the rose-ringed and monk parakeets in Tuscany region through a fixed kernel method, and their potential distribution through a bioclimatic envelope (BIOCLIM), using variables selected from the WORLDCLIM database. BIOCLIM analysis suggested a possible expansion risk for the analysed species in Tuscany, as both were predicted with a huge amount of suitable but not occupied habitat. In particular, the rose-ringed parakeet may colonize the inner part of the region, while the southern part of the region may be exposed to a possible range expansion of the monk parakeet. Molteplici attività umane hanno mostrato di rappresentare una seria minaccia per la biodiversità presente e futura, con impatti esercitati a scala globale fino a quella locale. Gli impatti antropici sulla biodiversità possono essere suddivisi in due categorie: gli impatti direttamente derivanti dalle attività umane e quelli mediati da altri taxa, il cui effetto negativo è tuttavia innescato ed aggravato dall’azione umana. In particolare, la tesi è stata incentrata sull’analisi di tre grandi minacce antropiche alla biodiversità, attraverso l’utilizzo di molteplici approcci modellistici: cambiamento climatico globale, perdita e degradazione di habitat e specie <b>aliene</b> invasive. Un primo caso studio ha valutato l’effetto del cambiamento climatico su comunità ornitiche mediterranee, attraverso l’utilizzo del framework modellistico “SESAM”, elaborato per modellizzare assemblaggi di specie. I risultati hanno evidenziato come l’effetto predetto del cambiamento climatico sulle comunità ornitiche oggetto di studio consista in una sostanziale alterazione delle loro caratteristiche, sebbene approcci modellistici diversi suggeriscano l’incidenza di effetti differenti. Le predizioni elaborate considerando esclusivamente i fattori abiotici suggeriscono un prevalente aumento della distribuzione delle specie costituenti le comunità. D’altro canto, l’inclusione nelle proiezioni di fattori macroecologici e di regole biotiche di composizione delle comunità hanno permesso di catturare in maniera più efficace alcune dinamiche strettamente legate alle interazioni interspecifiche, riportando risultati coerenti con l’attuale conoscenza dell’ecologia delle specie studiate. Tale divergenza nei risultati sottolinea l’importanza di comparare più tecniche modellistiche al fine di valutare le implicazioni di carattere conservazionistico del cambiamento climatico sulle comunità ornitiche in area mediterranea. I due successivi casi studio hanno analizzato il ruolo della gestione forestale tradizionale e degli impianti eolici come fattori di perdita e degradazione di habitat per specie di vertebrati in Italia Centrale. E’ stata innanzitutto testata l’ipotesi secondo la quale la gestione forestale sostenibile possa implicare dinamiche più simili a quelle di una successione forestale naturale, rispetto alla gestione tradizionale, esercitando quindi un effetto meno impattante a lungo termine sulla distribuzione di vertebrati forestali. E’ stata proposta la prima integrazione del modello di dinamica forestale “LANDIS – II” con modelli di distribuzione di specie in un framework modellistico ibrido. Il framework, applicato su quattro vertebrati forestali (Salamandrina dagli occhiali, Orbettino, Picchio muratore e Nottola di Leisler), include tre componenti: modelli di dinamica forestale (FDM), modelli di distribuzione di specie (SDMs) e analisi dei pattern spaziali (SPA). FDM è stato usato per simulare scenari forestali spazialmente espliciti per il tempo presente ed il 2050, imponendo tre scenari alternativi di gestione forestale. I pattern forestali simulati sono stati poi analizzati con SPA, al fine di calcolare metriche di paesaggio che sono state utilizzate come variabili ambientali per SDMs. Traiettorie di paesaggio sono state calcolate sulle distribuzioni attuali e future prodotte da SDMs per le specie studiate, così da valutare l’effetto di diverse pratiche forestali sulla loro estensione e grado di frammentazione. I risultati hanno mostrato come la gestione forestale abbia impatti principalmente sulla configurazione spaziale delle distribuzioni predette, anziché sulla loro estensione. La gestione forestale sostenibile è risultata più favorevole di quella tradizionale nell’aumentare l’estensione delle distribuzioni predette e nel ridurne il grado di frammentazione. I risultati supportano la conclusione secondo la quale pratiche di gestione forestale orientate alla conservazione possano generare dinamiche più simili a quelle di una successione forestale naturale, rispetto alla gestione tradizionale, favorendo elementi quali la disetaneità delle foreste, la loro ricchezza specifica, l’aggregazione dei frammenti di bosco e la variabilità nelle loro distanze, che sono risultati fondamentali nel preservare a lungo termine i vertebrati forestali. La valutazione del potenziale effetto nocivo esercitato dalle turbine eoliche sulle rotte di migrazione e di spostamento giornaliero dei chirotteri, è stata effettuata mediante un modello di distribuzione di specie a scala regionale. Il modello è stato implementato per la Nottola di Leisler in una regione dell’Italia Centrale attualmente soggetta a forte sviluppo di impianti eolici. Il modello di distribuzione di specie è stato sviluppato con l’ausilio del software MAXENT, utilizzando 47 punti di presenza della specie (ridotti a 19 dopo la correzione per l’effetto dell’autocorrelazione spaziale) e 10 variabili ambientali derivate da mappe topografiche e di uso del suolo. Il modello è stato usato per creare una mappa di connettività attraverso il software UNICOR, allo scopo di identificare potenziali corridoi di spostamento per la specie (PCCs). L’incidenza di ciascuna turbina sulle rotte di volo dei chirotteri è stata valutata sovrapponendo le turbine esistenti (380) e pianificate (195) sui PCCs. I risultati riportano che la maggior parte dei corridoi potenziali sono localizzati nella parte occidentale della regione, che ospita la maggior parte delle aree idonee alla specie; il grosso delle turbine esistenti (54 %) e pianificate (72 %) interferisce con importanti corridoi che collegano le parti occidentale e orientale della regione. Gli ultimi due casi studio hanno analizzato gli impatti derivanti dalle Specie <b>Aliene</b> Invasive (IAS) su diverse specie di vertebrati a scale spaziali differenti, con enfasi da parte di entrambi circa l’importanza di un appropriato livello di conoscenza necessario ad affrontare tale rilevante minaccia alla biodiversità. La nicchia climatica realizzata di una specie invasiva può essere usata per predire la sua distribuzione potenziale in altre aree, fornendo la base per procedure di screening nella compilazione di liste nere e bianche, allo scopo di prevenire nuovi eventi di introduzione. Quest’asserto è stato testato modellizzando la nicchia climatica realizzata dello Scoiattolo grigio. Il software MAXENT è stato utilizzato per sviluppare tre modelli di distribuzione di specie: un primo considerando soltanto i punti di presenza dall’areale nativo (NRM), un secondo includendo punti sia dall’areale nativo che da quello d’invasione (NIRM) ed un terzo calibrato solo con punti dall’areale d’invasione e proiettato in areale nativo (RCM). Differenze tra la nicchia nativa ed invasiva sono state testate attraverso test di equivalenza e similarità. I risultati hanno mostrato che NRM non ha predetto accuratamente alcune parti del range d’invasione attualmente occupato dalla specie in Europa, mentre RCM ha sottostimato l’idoneità nel range nativo. NIRM ha predetto accuratamente sia il range nativo che quello di invasione. La nicchia nativa e quella invasiva sono risultate statisticamente non equivalenti, mentre i test di similarità non hanno riportato risultati significativi. Le analisi supportano la conclusione secondo la quale i modelli di distribuzione di specie si rivelano un utile strumento per la compilazione delle liste nere, permettendo di identificare le aree a potenziale rischio di invasione. Tuttavia, è necessario adottare cautela nell’utilizzare questi modelli includendo solo punti dall’areale nativo di una specie invasiva per compilare liste bianche, poiché tali tecniche presentano un rischio significativo di sottostimare il range potenziale di invasione. L’utilità dei modelli di distribuzione di specie per la valutazione del rischio di invasione da parte di IAS è emersa anche nell’analizzare la distribuzione potenziale del Parrocchetto dal collare e del Parrocchetto monaco, in Italia Centrale. Gli Psittaciformi rivestono un ruolo fondamentale tra le specie <b>aliene</b> importate dall’uomo in tutto il mondo, essendo tra i più popolari uccelli di compagnia. Tali specie, se rilasciate, spesso creano popolazioni naturalizzate, essendo caratterizzate da ampia tolleranza ecologica. L’ultimo caso studio della tesi ha riguardato la ricostruzione statistica del range di occorrenza attuale (EOO) del Parrocchetto dal collare e del Parrocchetto monaco in Toscana attraverso il metodo del fixed kernel, oltre che della distribuzione potenziale di queste due specie attraverso l’algoritmo BIOCLIM, utilizzando variabili climatiche del database WORLDCLIM. L’analisi effettuata con BIOCLIM ha suggerito un possibile rischio di espansione per i entrambe le specie in Toscana, poiché entrambe presentano consistenti aree idonee e non ancora occupate. In particolare il Parrocchetto dal collare è risultato un potenziale colonizzatore della parte interna della regione, mentre le aree meridionali sono risultate esposte alla potenziale espansione del Parrocchetto monaco.

40|$|The Mediterranean {{brown trout}} (Salmo trutta complex) {{is one of}} the {{freshwater}} fish species complex at greater risk of extinction in the Mediterranean area. The introduction of alien invasive species and their interaction with the native fauna represent some of the major threats to the survival of this species (Caputo et al., 2004). Currently, the genetic integrity of the Mediterranean trout is being compromised by the introgressive hybridization with the Atlantic trout. This hybridization, which was favored by stocking programs carried out in the last century (Splendiani et al., 2013), is resulting in the loss of native genetic variability. The Life+ TROTA Project, which started in November 2013, is aimed to preserve the last populations of Apennine trout (Salmo cettii Rafinesque, 1810) and recover autochthonous genetic diversity. These action are being carried out in seven river basins of central Italy, where native populations have been threatened by stocking with Atlantic trout. The data collected are the indispensable premise for the adoption of the necessary strategies for conservation of the Apennine trout. The trout is a wide-ranging species complex native to Eurasia and North Africa. The northern limits to its range are represented by Iceland, northern Scandinavia and Russia, while the southern limits are represented by the mountain streams of northern Morocco. This species has also been introduced in several other locations around the world (North and South - America, Australia, etc). The Apennine trout is considered as critically endangered in the IUCN Red List of Italian vertebrates (Rondinini et al., 2013) due to water abstraction, overfishing and stocking with non-native trout (resulting in hybridization and competition). In the last 10 - 12 years the population has declined by almost 30 %, and this trend is expected also in the future as water abstraction will most likely increase. The project focuses on 14 sites included in the Natura 2000 EU wide network of nature protection areas, established under the 1992 Habitat Directive. The project involved also the territory of the National Park of Monti Sibillini. The study area comprises 7 watersheds: Metauro, Cesano, Esino, Potenza, Chienti, Tevere and Tenna; a total of 25 watercourses were investigated with 32 sampling stations. A census of the fish fauna by electrofishing was carried out at each sampling location. For each specimen captured, total length and weight was measured, and a fin clip was collected for genomic DNA extraction. Genetic analyses were performed by using mitochondrial (D-loop fragment of 310 bp) and nuclear markers (locus LDH-C 1 * and 12 microsatellites). Bayesian clustering implemented in Structure 2. 3. 2. 1 was used for estimating the number of groups (k) represented by all sampled individuals (Pritchard et al., 2000; Falush et al., 2003). The genetic and demographic characterization of trout populations in 32 sites allowed us to select: i) six sites for the collections of adults, needed for the production of genetically pure juveniles trout, ii) four sites for supportive breeding actions and iii) six sites to carry out the eradication of alien trout and successive re-introduction of Mediterranean trout. Another significant activity of the project is the hydrological characterization of the water courses by the Minimum Flow Analysis (MFA), adopting the MesoHABSIM method (Parasiewicz, 2007). This action is crucial to monitor the effect of water abstraction in the sites involved in the concrete conservation actions (e. g., eradication and re-introduction), and more generally, in the study area. In this way, we hope to increase the chances of long term survival of Apennine trout populations. Main expected results are the following: 	Identification of natural populations of Apennine trout in the study area and their protection through specific changes in existing regulation. 	Establishment of genetically pure wild populations with fish produced in an hatchery specifically adapted to manage wild native broodstock. 	Widening Apennine trout habitat availability by removal of non native trout in areas to be restocked. 	Restocking of streams selected in previous actions with pure juvenile trout. 	Assessment of the summer river flows in order to increase the chances of survival of Apennine trout populations in compliance with the regulations on minimum flow and water quality. 	Involvement of local sport fishing community to increase their awareness of the problem and ease their acceptance of more restricting fishery and fish management rules. At present the genetic and demographic characterization of the trout populations is completed. Table 1 and Figures 1 - 2 show the results of abundance analysis of the fish assemblages divided by basin. The standing crop’s mean values can be considered in the standard range, according to the small size and the limited productivity that generally characterized the watercourses analyzed, as most of the Apennine rivers. The differences of the mean values among basins were highly statistically significant according to the ANOVA analysis (density: F= 5. 24, p= 0. 001; standing crop: F= 12. 42, p= 0. 001). The results of genetic analysis separated clearly native and <b>aliene</b> genomes (K = 2, Fig. 3 a) and showed the presence of three distinct genetic stocks of native Apennine trout (K = 4, Fig. 3 b) : i) Tevere (green bars), ii) Tenna (red) and iii) Chienti /Potenza/Metauro/Esino (yellow). Populations characterized by very low introgression values will be the source of wild individuals to produce pure juvenile trouts in captivity. Four moderately introgressed populations will be subject to supportive breeding activities. Finally, six stream, where trouts showed almost exclusively an alien genetic make-up will be selected for the eradication activities. The data collected are the indispensable premise for the adoption of the necessary strategies for conservation of the Apennine trout in Central Italy...|$|E
