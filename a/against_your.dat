Most of the money raised is from competing clubs offsetting the competition with dollars or larger denominations, since it all goes to charity.|$|E

25|$|As {{an emotion}} {{regulation}} strategy, people can bet against a desired outcome. A New England Patriots fan, for example, could bet their opponents to win {{to reduce the}} negative emotions felt if the team loses a game. People typically do not bet against desired outcomes {{that are important to}} their identity, due to negative signal about their identity that making such a gamble entails. Betting <b>against</b> <b>your</b> team or political candidate, for example, may signal to you that you are not as committed to them as you thought you were.|$|E
500|$|Point System - Depending on the {{character}} and LARP, your PC will {{have some form of}} Body and/or Armor that is measured nominally. Weapons also have a numerical value assigned, where upon a successful weapon strike you deal 'damage' equal to the number associated with your weapon type. This damage is dealt <b>against</b> <b>your</b> opponents Body/Armor. Typically, once you reach 0 body or less, you then begin the death stage which will be found in the [...] A subset of the point system is the Location System, where points vary depending on where your opponent is struck. If they are wearing armor in that location, then the 'damage dealt' effects their Armor Points (AP), versus if you strike a location without armor you deal damage <b>against</b> <b>your</b> opponents Body Points (BP). The majority of LARP's utilize this system.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the series, Bobrov {{held a press}} luncheon in Moscow. He {{refused to}} {{consider}} that either team would sweep the series. To him, Team Canada had [...] "the fire power, know-how and goaltending", but how would it adapt to international rules, two-referee system and amateur officials? He conceded that Phil Esposito would [...] "be difficult {{to move from the}} front of the net. I expect there will be some surprises for us when we meet your Canadian stars." [...] He also predicted that Valeri Kharlamov [...] "will stand out, even <b>against</b> <b>your</b> best Canadians. By North American standards, he is small but he has an excellent shot. I think he will be effective." [...] Sinden was aware of Kharlamov and he selected Ron Ellis to the Team Canada roster especially to cover Kharlamov.|$|E

[...] In an interview for the New York Post, she explained the album to be about [...] "the war against self ... <b>against</b> <b>your</b> inner being", and said of her hiatus, [...] "I've always taken my time between albums. I'm a performing artist - recording is secondary to me. My performances are what drive me. It's like my therapy. I like to write a lot while I'm on the road before I even think about recording." [...] Badu also said that she now had a relevant message to express for listeners and was no longer struggling with a creative block.|$|E

Fellow Barcelona player Giovanni van Bronckhorst was emotional as he won against his former club: [...] "It's special to win the final, and even more special to do it <b>against</b> <b>your</b> old team". Samuel Eto'o, scorer of Barcelona's first goal, cited Liverpool's comeback against Milan as inspiration for Barcelona's victory: [...] "After having seen what Liverpool did last year, we told ourselves not to throw in the towel. We followed Liverpool's example". Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard praised the role of goalkeeper Victor Valdés in their victory, stating {{that he made a}} number of important saves to keep them in the match: [...] "Valdes played a decisive role.

500|$|The Allied fleet {{sailed to}} Salamis, {{off the coast}} of Attica, to assist with the {{evacuation}} of the remaining Athenians. En route, Themistocles left inscriptions addressed to the Ionian Greek crews of the Persian fleet on all springs of water that they might stop at, asking them to defect to the Allied cause:"Men of Ionia, that what you are doing is not proper, campaigning <b>against</b> <b>your</b> fathers and wishing to enslave Greece. It would be best if you came on our side. But if this is not possible, at least during the battle stand aside and also beg the Carians to do the same with you.

500|$|Parts II and III have {{a similar}} structure; an {{overarching}} narrative of the Fairchild family is interspersed with inset moral tales. Both are noticeably less evangelical than Part I. Part II begins with the recognition by the Fairchild parents that their children have [...] "a new and divine nature, which works <b>against</b> <b>your</b> evil natures, causing you to know when you have done wrong, and making you truly and deeply sorrowful when you have committed a sin." [...] Emily, Lucy and Henry have finally learned to discipline their own souls. Parts II and III focus {{to a greater extent}} on good breeding, virtuous consumption and one's duty to the poor than does Part I. One of the most important lessons that the children learn, for instance, is respect for their elders. Moreover, the gibbet to which the children had been taken to observe a rotting corpse and instructed regarding the spiritual perils of sibling rivalry in Part I, has disappeared in Part II; Henry and his father walk by the spot where it used to stand and note its absence.|$|E

500|$|Work on the game's storyline {{and levels}} began in January 1993. Jones {{recalled}} that starting from cliché plots they moved towards [...] "very interesting and unique but {{extremely difficult to}} understand stories". One of the more complicated stories cast the player {{as one of a}} group of Roman soldiers who discovered a mountain spring that extended their lives. Every seven years one soldier would be picked to descend into the caves and bring back more water. If the leader died, a new one would be selected to undertake the journey to ensure their survival. [...] "It was a very interesting plot since your quest wasn't necessarily virtuous, it didn't involve doing good things or saving the world," [...] Jones said. [...] "It was just you were chosen, more or less <b>against</b> <b>your</b> will, to become the next leader of this freak cult of immortals." [...] The final plot occupied a middle ground between the simple and complex stories, because the developers did not want to force players to become deeply involved in the story.|$|E

The singer had done an arrangement for piano on the computer that was impossible for a piano to play, and she got them to sing it. Then, she also called up beatboxer Shlomo, who was recommended to her as [...] "the new bright hope of the hip hop scene". He went to record the next day and Björk asked him to do a techno tango beat, which he did. Recalling her work on the song until her last day of mixing, she commented, [...] "That was the most fun part, in the end.

500|$|From Molossia, Themistocles {{apparently}} fled to Pydna, {{from where}} he took a ship for Asia Minor. This ship was blown off course by a storm, and ended up at Naxos, which an Athenian fleet {{was in the process}} of besieging. Desperate to avoid identification, Themistocles pestered the captain of the ship to continue the journey immediately. According to Thucydides, who wrote within living memory of the events, the ship eventually landed safely at Ephesus, where Themistocles disembarked. Plutarch has the ship docking at Cyme in Aeolia, and Diodorus has Themistocles making his way to Asia in an undefined manner. Diodorus and Plutarch next recount a similar tale, namely that Themistocles stayed briefly with an acquaintance (Lysitheides or Nicogenes) who was also acquainted with the Persian king, Artaxerxes I. Since there was a bounty on Themistocles's head, this acquaintance devised a plan to safely convey Themistocles to the Persian king in the type of covered wagon that the King's concubines travelled in. All three chroniclers agree that Themistocles's next move was to contact the Persian king; in Thucydides, this is by letter, while Plutarch and Diodorus have a face-to-face meeting with the king. The spirit is, however, the same in all three: Themistocles introduces himself to the king and seeks to enter his service: [...] "I, Themistocles, am come to you, who did your house more harm than any of the Hellenes, when I was compelled to defend myself <b>against</b> <b>your</b> father's invasion—harm, however, far surpassed by the good that I did him during his retreat, which brought no danger for me but much for him."

500|$|Following Heywood's {{arrival in}} Portsmouth his family sought help from their wide circle of {{influential}} friends, {{and set out}} to secure the best available legal counsel. Most active on Heywood's behalf was his older sister Hester ("Nessy"), who gave her brother unqualified support, writing to him on 3 June: [...] "If the transactions of that day were as Mr. Bligh represented them, such is my conviction of your worth and honor that I will without hesitation stake my life on your innocence. If on the contrary you were concerned in such a conspiracy <b>against</b> <b>your</b> commander, I shall be firmly convinced that his conduct was the occasion of it." [...] Heywood sent his personal narrative of the mutiny to the Earl of Chatham, who was First Lord of the Admiralty and brother to the prime minister, William Pitt. This was a step Heywood subsequently regretted; he had not consulted his lawyers, and his narrative contained statements that Heywood later rescinded {{on the grounds that they}} were [...] "the errors of an imperfect recollection". On 8 June Nessy was advised by her and Heywood's uncle, Captain Thomas Pasley, that on the basis of information from the returned Pandora crew [...] "...your brother appears by all account to be the greatest culprit of all, Christian alone excepted ... I have no hope of his not being condemned." [...] Later, however, Pasley was able to offer some comfort; Captain Montagu of Hector, where Heywood was held, was Pasley's [...] "particular friend". By chance another Heywood naval relative by marriage, Captain Albemarle Bertie, was in Portsmouth Harbour with his ship , moored alongside Hector. Mrs Bertie, and Edgar's officers, were frequent visitors to Heywood, bringing gifts of food, clothing and other comforts.|$|E
