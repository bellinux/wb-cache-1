25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio feels that way <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>too.</b> They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E
25|$|Ashman was {{initially}} reluctant {{to agree to}} work on Beauty and the Beast because he had just recently been diagnosed with AIDS. Additionally, he had already begun writing songs for Aladdin (1992). Ashman's health began deteriorating soon after he completed The Little Mermaid. However, he wanted his illness to remain secret and decided to tell few <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Too</b> weak to travel, Ashman requested that he be allowed {{to work on the}} film's songs from his home, causing Menken and the filmmakers to frequently travel from the film's studio in Burbank, California to his home in New York in order to collaborate with him. Ashman wrote the majority of the song's lyrics from his deathbed. It was later revealed that he viewed the Beast's curse as an allegory for AIDS, and that the mob song 'Kill The Beast' was inspired by public sentiment at the time against AIDS and the gay community.|$|E
500|$|The composers {{started their}} writing separately, Cornell in his {{apartment}} in Paris, and Arnold in his house in London. Cornell stated that he had some difficulties with composing: [...] "It is difficult, I think, to write lyrics for a character, so really I just kind of wandered around {{for about a month}} not thinking <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> much, until I sort of formulated some idea of a way that I could approach it, where I'm kind of relating to what's in the character in the movie. And because this particular Bond is very edgy, but also has a lot of emotional depth, it's a lot easier." [...] Later the two musicians met and showed each other's ideas, and according to Arnold [...] "it was almost like we wrote two parts of the same song." [...] Cornell wrote lyrics, to which Arnold added some lines and later music. Some of Arnold's ideas included the song's title, the heavy introduction, and [...] "having the same genetic material as the Bond theme, but in a different order and in a different shape".|$|E

500|$|... "Cop Killer" [...] was {{replaced}} by a new version of [...] "Freedom of Speech," [...] a song from Ice-T's 1989 solo album The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say. The song was re-edited and remixed to give it a more rock-oriented sound, using a looped sample from the Jimi Hendrix song [...] "Foxy Lady." [...] Alongside the album's reissue, Warner Bros. issued [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as a single. Ice-T left Warner Bros. Records the following year because of disputes over his solo album Home Invasion, taking Body Count with him. The studio version of [...] "Cop Killer" [...] has not been re-released, although a live version of the song appears on Body Count's 2005 release Live in L.A. According to Ernie C, the controversy over the song [...] "still lingers for us, even now. I'll try to book clubs and the guy I'm talking to will mention it and I'll think to myself 'Man, that was 17 years ago.' But I meet a lot of bands who ask me <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too,</b> and I'm real respected by other artists for it. But it's a love/hate thing. Ice gets it too, even though he plays a cop on TV now on Law & Order SVU." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{provenance}} {{for this}} object is not good, and being {{cut with a}} steel blade makes it suspect, both Métraux and Barthel believed it to be undoubtedly genuine. One reason is that it contains the rare glyph 36 and the rare compounds 38 and 684, and so is an unlikely forgery, though Barthel found out <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> late to include it in his catalogue. It was sold to the Musée de I'Homme in December 1961 by one Henry Reichlen, who had acquired it from a French family who had owned it for several generations — eighty years, by their count.|$|E

2500|$|The August 1897 season {{opened with}} the new lecture hall the [...] "Eirenion", ("place of peace",) and Sarah Farmer and Greenacre made the New York Times.

He was enthusiastic about the kind of interfaith coming together process of Greenacre. Unitarian Alfred W. Martin closed the 1897 season with a talk [...] "Universal Religion and the World's Religions", the theme of which became his life's work. Electrical engineers met at the conference center at least in 1897 as the fiftieth anniversary of the invention of the electric tolley car.|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Gordon scored {{his record}} 5th {{win in the}} Brickyard 400 after passing Kasey Kahne on a restart with 17 laps to go. The race was {{dominated}} {{by a variety of}} pit strategies. Kasey Kahne lead the most laps in the race with 70 as Hendrick powered cars led 127 of the 160 laps. [...] "Those emotions take over. There's nothing better, especially in a big race, coming to Victory Lane with your family here," [...] said an emotional Gordon. [...] "I was trying so hard with 10 to go not to focus on the crowd. I didn't want to think <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> much, but you can't help it." [...] "Looking back, I should have chosen the (outside lane)," [...] Kahne said. [...] "They pretty much let Jeff control that restart. I took off and never spun a tire and the inside had been more grip throughout the race and I started on the inside and I {{thought it was a great}} decision. But I didn't spin a tire and Jeff drove right by me before we were even got to the second (restart line)." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 24 January 2006, it was {{announced}} that the band had reformed and signed a record deal with Parlophone. They subsequently began work on their third studio album, Studio 1. The first single, [...] "Rock Steady" [...] (released in November 2006), reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. Studio 1 entered the albums chart at number forty and sold 60,000 copies according to the BPI, being certified silver. A second single, [...] "Chick Fit" [...] failed to reach the top 200. Blatt discussed the reunion's failure in an interview with i-D magazine in 2012: [...] "I don't think it was done for the right reasons... I know that I did it for the money. We got signed before we had even made music again, it wasn't like we felt we had something to give back to the world... we were given an opportunity and took it, without really thinking <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> hard". She also said she never felt comfortable with the success the band had and that [...] "it was not necessarily the plan at the beginning; {{there was a lot of}} compromise involved".|$|E

2500|$|Paul Kinsey (Michael Gladis); regular Seasons 1–3, {{guest star}} Season 5: A {{creative}} copywriter and Princeton University alumnus, the bearded, pipe-smoking Paul {{prides himself on}} his politically liberal views. Some time before the series began he {{had a relationship with}} Joan Holloway which ended badly, largely because Paul talked <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> much. Paul tried, unsuccessfully, to date Peggy soon after she was hired by Sterling Cooper. Through most of the second season, Paul dated Sheila White, an African-American woman from South Orange, New Jersey. They break up while in Oxford, Mississippi, where they had gone as Freedom Riders to oppose segregation in the South. It is a source of pride for Kinsey to live in the low-income, southern section of Montclair, New Jersey; Joan, however, mocks him as a shallow poseur. He is highly competitive, an attribute revealed to have soured a few friendships while he was in college, and which causes friction with Peggy, who quickly proves to be a superior copywriter to him. [...] He is furious upon discovering that Don chose Peggy for the new agency over him. Paul did not appear after the third season finale until he reappeared in the tenth episode of Season 5, revealing himself to Harry as a disciple of Krishna Consciousness. Paul asks Harry to look at a Star Trek script he wrote, which Harry thinks is awful. Harry later realizes that Paul's girlfriend is manipulating him because of his recruiting skills within the Krishna movement, and encourages Paul to follow his dreams. He gives Paul $500 and tells him to get to Los Angeles as soon as possible.|$|E
