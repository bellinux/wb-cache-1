Boldine treatment in diabetic animals prevented the increase in glycemia, blood pressure, renal thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and the urinary protein/creatinine ratio. Boldine also reduced alterations in matrix proteins and markers of renal damage. In mesangial cells, boldine prevented the increase in oxidative stress, the decrease in gap junctional communication, {{and the increase in}} cell permeability due to connexin hemichannel activity induced by high glucose and proinflammatory cytokines but did not block gap junction channels. Thus boldine prevented both renal and cellular alterations and could be useful for preventing tissue damage in diabetic subjects...|$|E

40|$|Cellular {{senescence}} is {{a specialized}} form of growth arrest, confined to mitotic cells, induced by various stressful stimuli and {{characterized by a}} permanent growth arrest, resistance to apoptosis, an altered pattern of gene expression and the expression of some markers that are characteristic, although not exclusive, to the senescent state. Senescent cells profoundly modify neighboring and remote cells through the production of an altered secretome, eventually leading to inflammation, fibrosis and possibly growth of neoplastic cells. Mammalian aging {{has been defined as}} a reduction in the capacity to adequately maintain <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> or to repair tissues after injury. <b>Tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> and regenerative capacity are nowadays considered {{to be related to the}} stem cell pool present in every tissue. For this reason, pathological and patho-physiological conditions characterized by <b>altered</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> and impaired regenerative capacity can be viewed as a consequence of the reduction in stem cell number and/or function. Last, cellular senescence is a double-edged sword, since it may inhibit the growth of transformed cells, preventing the occurrence of cancer, while it may facilitate growth of preneoplastic lesions in a paracrine fashion; therefore, interventions targeting this cell response to stress may have a profound impact on many age-related pathologies, ranging from cardiovascular disease to oncology. Aim of this review is to discuss both molecular mechanisms associated with stem cell senescence and interventions that may attenuate or reverse this process...|$|R
40|$|Aging is a {{degenerative}} process {{characterized by}} the accumulation of cellular damage that results in <b>altered</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis,</b> organ function, and, ultimately, death. Tissues {{with the potential for}} regeneration (muscle) or that undergo cellular turnover (intestine, blood, skin) rely on populations of adult stem or progenitor cells to divide and replace damaged cells to maintain <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis.</b> One hallmark of aging is reduced stem cell function, which can lead to decreased <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis.</b> The exact mechanisms for aging are still unclear, but recent evidence suggests an important role for adult stem cells in organismal aging. Current reports indicate that alterations in adult stem cell function via changes in stem cell metabolism can have widespread effects on <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> and aging. Thanks to its relatively short lifespan and amenability to genetic manipulations, the model organism Drosophila melanogaster provides a convenient system to study the interaction between somatic stem cell metabolism and aging. A recently discovered population of intestinal stem cells in Drosophila bears many similarities to the stem cells of the mammalian small intestine. Genetic tractability, a simple cell lineage, and conserved pathways that regulate stem cell behavior combine to make the Drosophila midgut epithelium a powerful model system for the study of stem cell regulation and <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis.</b> Here, we show that increased mitochondrial biogenesis or enhanced electron transport chain function in the intestinal stem cells results in increased <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis,</b> a delay in age-related midgut phenotypes, and increased lifespan. This prompted us to study the roles of mitochondrial dynamics (fission, fusion, movement, and turnover) on intestinal stem cell function. We demonstrate that loss of either of two, mitophagy-related genes, pink 1 or parkin, in Drosophila ISCs leads to: severe alterations in mitochondrial structure, nearly complete inhibition of stem cell proliferation during aging or stress, and the appearance of senescence-associated markers within the ISCs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe p 53 {{transcription}} factor is activated by {{various types of}} cell stress or DNA damage and induces the expression of genes that control cell growth and inhibit tumor formation. Analysis of mice that express mutant forms of p 53 suggest that inappropriate p 53 activation can <b>alter</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> and life span, connecting p 53 tumor suppressor functions with accelerated aging. However, other mouse models that display increased levels of wildtype p 53 in various tissues fail to corroborate a link between p 53 and aging phenotypes, possibly due to the retention of signaling pathways that negatively regulate p 53 activity in these models. In this present study, we have generated mice lacking Mdm 2 in the epidermis. Deletion of Mdm 2, the chief negative regulator of p 53, induced an aging phenotype in the skin of mice, including thinning of the epidermis, reduced wound healing, and a progressive loss of fur. These phenotypes arise due to an induction of p 53 -mediated senescence in epidermal stem cells and a gradual loss of epidermal stem cell function. These results reveal that activation of endogenous p 53 by ablation of Mdm 2 can induce accelerated aging phenotypes in mice...|$|R

However, the phenotypic identities and functional properties of this heterogeneous population within the peritoneal cavity remains poorly elucidated. In the context of peritoneal dialysis, it is hypothesized that the modification of macrophage/dendritic cell biology by the dialysis process would <b>alter</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis,</b> host susceptibility to infection and local immunity, compromising long-term outcomes of the patients. The research work carried out in this thesis has tested this hypothesis by examination of the immunobiology (mainly phenotype and function) of human and murine peritoneal macrophage and dendritic cell subsets. Moreover, the potential link between the altered immunobiology of peritoneal mononuclear phagocytes and clinical outcomes of the dialysis patients has been investigated. Several key findings were generated during these studies: 1) multiple discrete peritoneal macrophage and dendritic cell subsets have been phenotypically identified in humans (from different clinical settings of peritoneal dialysis) and in mice (from naïve and inflamed conditions); 2) in humans, the phenotypes and the activation/maturation status of peritoneal macrophages and dendritic cells are modified throughout the dialysis course and also during acute peritonitis; some characteristic alterations are associated with adverse patient outcomes; 3) in mice, the distinctive kinetics of the respective peritoneal macrophage and dendritic cell subsets in clinically relevant acute peritonitis models have been characterized; 4) individual peritoneal macrophage and dendritic cell subsets (human and mice) display differences in their phagocytic capacity and the ability to process and present antigen...|$|R

40|$|Deregulation of the p 16 INK 4 a–cyclin D:cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk) 4 / 6 –retinoblastoma (pRB) pathway is {{a common}} {{paradigm}} in the oncogenic transformation of human cells and suggests that this pathway functions linearly in malignant transformation. However, it is not understood why p 16 INK 4 a and cyclin D:cdk 4 / 6 mutations are disproportionately more common than the rare genetic event of RB inactivation in human malignancies such as melanoma. To better understand how these complexes contribute to <b>altered</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis,</b> we blocked cdk 4 / 6 activation and acutely inactivated Rb by conditional mutagenesis during mouse hair follicle cycling. Inhibition of cdk 4 / 6 in the skin by subcutaneous administration of a membrane-transducible TAT-p 16 INK 4 a protein completely blocked hair follicle growth and differentiation. In contrast, acute disruption of Rb in the skin of homozygous RbLoxP/LoxP mice via subcutaneous administration of TAT-Cre recombinase failed to affect hair growth. However, loss of Rb resulted in severe depigmentation of hair follicles. Further analysis of follicular melanocytes in vivo and in primary cell culture demonstrated that pRB plays a cell-autonomous role in melanocyte survival. Moreover, functional inactivation of all three Rb family members (Rb, p 107, and p 130) in primary melanocytes by treatment with a transducible TAT-E 1 A protein did not rescue the apoptotic phenotype. These findings suggest that deregulated cyclin D:cdk 4 / 6 complexes and pRB perform nonoverlapping functions in vivo and provide a cellular mechanism that accounts for the low incidence of RB inactivation in cancers such as melanoma...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to understand the regulation of stem cell division because defects in this process can cause <b>altered</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> or cancer. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Dacapo (Dap), a p 21 /p 27 homolog, acts downstream of the microRNA (miRNA) pathway to regulate the cell cycle in Drosophila melanogaster germline stem cells (GSCs). Tissue-extrinsic signals, including insulin, also regulate cell division of GSCs. We report that intrinsic and extrinsic regulators intersect in GSC division control; the Insulin receptor (InR) pathway regulates Dap levels through miRNAs, thereby controlling GSC division. Using GFP-dap 3 ′UTR sensors in vivo, we show that in GSCs the dap 3 ′UTR is responsive to Dicer- 1, an RNA endonuclease III required for miRNA processing. Furthermore, the dap 3 ′UTR can be directly targeted by miR- 7, miR- 278 and miR- 309 in luciferase assays. Consistent with this, miR- 278 and miR- 7 mutant GSCs are partially defective in GSC division and show abnormal cell cycle marker expression, respectively. These data suggest that the GSC cell cycle is regulated via the dap 3 ′UTR by multiple miRNAs. Furthermore, the GFP-dap 3 ′UTR sensors respond to InR but not to TGF-β signaling, suggesting that InR signaling utilizes Dap for GSC cell cycle regulation. We further demonstrate that the miRNA-based Dap regulation may act downstream of InR signaling; Dcr- 1 and Dap are required for nutrition-dependent cell cycle regulation in GSCs and reduction of dap partially rescues the cell cycle defect of InR-deficient GSCs. These data suggest that miRNA- and Dap-based cell cycle regulation in GSCs can be controlled by InR signaling...|$|R
40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{a complex}} disease whose {{pathogenesis}} includes the contribution of biomechanical and metabolic factors which, <b>altering</b> the <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> of articular cartilage and subchondral bone, determine the predominance of destructive over productive processes. A {{key role in the}} pathophysiology of articular cartilage is played by cell/extra-cellular matrix (ECM) interactions, which are mediated by cell surface integrins. In a physiologic setting, integrins modulate cell/ECM signaling, essential for regulating growth and differentiation and maintaining cartilage homeostasis. During OA, abnormal integrin expression alters cell/ECM signaling and modifies chondrocyte synthesis, with the following imbalance of destructive cytokines over regulatory factors. IL- 1, TNF-alpha and other pro-catabolic cytokines activate the enzymatic degradation of cartilage matrix and are not counterbalanced by adequate synthesis of inhibitors. The main enzymes involved in ECM breakdown are metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are sequentially activated by an amplifying cascade. MMP activity is partially inhibited by the tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs), whose synthesis is low compared with MMP production in OA cartilage. Intriguing is the role of growth factors such as TGF-beta, IFG, BMP, NGF, and others, which do not simply repair the tissue damage induced by catabolic factors, but {{play an important role in}} OA pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|I. SUMMARY Background: Iron is an {{essential}} element necessary for many physiological processes involving oxygen transport, DNA-synthesis and ATP-formation. The fate of iron in the organism is tightly regulated especially at the absorption and distribution level probably mainly {{due to lack of}} specific active iron excretion mechanism. Any derangement of iron homeostatis may lead to appearance of free (unbound or loosely bound) iron, which can catalyse reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by Haber-Weiss chemistry. Cardiovascular diseases, particularly coronary heart disease (CHD), remain notwithstanding recent scientific advances important therapeutic problem. The most serious form of CHD represents acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The pathophysiology of AMI involves in most cases initial ischaemic period caused by coronary blood flow derangement due to a thrombus formation. Ischaemia <b>alters</b> substantially <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> with subsequent cytosolic free iron appearance. Reconstitution of coronary blood flow (reperfusion) represents the only way for myocardial tissue recovery although on the other hand, it is linked with a release of free redox-active iron in the circulation and formation of ROS both intracellularly as well extracellularly. Iron chelators are a large group of drugs with very [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Apoptosis {{plays an}} {{important}} role in development, growth, differentiation, <b>altered</b> gravity conditions, <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis,</b> immune defense, and cancer to control cell number in tissues and to eliminate individual cells that threaten the animal’s survival. The purposes of this review are to describe the signaling pathways and the cellular changes that occur with apoptosis. Currently, two pathways for activating apoptosis have been studied in detail. One starts with ligation of a death ligand to its transmembrane death receptor, followed by recruitment and activation of caspases in the death-inducing signalling complex. The second pathway involves the participation of mitochondria, which release caspase-activating proteins into the cytosol, thereby forming the apoptosome where caspases will bind and become activated. The novel agents include those targeting for the design of more effective and selective therapeutic strategies.

40|$|Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) {{are major}} executors of {{extracellular}} matrix remodeling and, consequently, play key {{roles in the}} response of cells to their microenvironment. The experimentally accessible stem cell population and the robust regenerative capabilities of planarians offer an ideal model to study how modulation of the proteolytic system in the extracellular environment affects cell behavior in vivo. Genome-wide identification of Schmidtea mediterranea MMPs reveals that planarians possess four mmp-like genes. Two of them (mmp 1 and mmp 2) are strongly expressed in a subset of secretory cells and encode putative matrilysins. The other genes (mt-mmpA and mt-mmpB) are widely expressed in postmitotic cells and appear structurally related to membrane-type MMPs. These genes are conserved in the planarian Dugesia japonica. Here we explore {{the role of the}} planarian mmp genes by RNA interference (RNAi) during <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> and regeneration. Our analyses identify essential functions for two of them. Following inhibition of mmp 1 planarians display dramatic disruption of tissues architecture and significant decrease in cell death. These results suggest that mmp 1 controls tissue turnover, modulating survival of postmitotic cells. Unexpectedly, the ability to regenerate is unaffected by mmp 1 (RNAi). Silencing of mt-mmpA <b>alters</b> <b>tissue</b> integrity and delays blastema growth, without affecting proliferation of stem cells. Our data support the possibility that the activity of this protease modulates cell migration and regulates anoikis, with a consequent pivotal role in <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> and regeneration. Our data provide evidence of the involvement of specific MMPs in <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> and regeneration and demonstrate that the behavior of planarian stem cells is critically dependent on the microenvironment surrounding these cells. Studying MMPs function in the planarian model provides evidence on how individual proteases work in vivo in adult tissues.

Here we show that cytoprotective Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling influences regeneration in the Drosophila gut by directing proliferation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Interestingly, this function of JNK contributes {{to the loss of}} <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> in old and stressed intestines by promoting the accumulation of misdifferentiated ISC daughter cells. Ectopic Delta/Notch signaling in these cells causes their abnormal differentiation but also limits JNK-induced proliferation.

40|$|How tissues {{adapt to}} varying {{nutrient}} conditions is of fundamental importance for robust <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> throughout an organism’s lifespan, but {{the underlying mechanisms}} are poorly understood. Here we show that Drosophila testis responds to protein starvation by eliminating transit-amplifying spermatogonia (SGs) while maintaining a reduced pool of actively proliferating germline stem cells (GSCs). During protein starvation, SGs die {{in a manner that}} is mediated by the apoptosis of somatic cyst cells (CCs) that encapsulate SGs and regulate their development. Strikingly, GSCs cannot be maintained during protein starvation when CC-mediated SG death is inhibited, leading to an irreversible collapse of <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis.</b> SG death is associated with phagocytic processes that may directly promote GSC function via local nutrient recycling.

Little {{is known about}} the regulation of <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> by organ-organ interaction. Here we demonstrate that trachea-derived Decapentaplegic (Dpp), the main bone morphogenetic protein ligand in Drosophila, is essential for adult midgut homeostasis.

Importantly, we find that Dpp is expressed specifically in tracheal cells that reach the intestinal cells through the visceral muscles. Depletion of dpp expression in tracheal cells phenocopies the Dpp loss-of-function defects in ECs.

Neuropsychological testing revealed mainly attentional and executive cognitive dysfunction in HD. Voxel-based-morphometry showed only marginal alterations in the right inferior medial temporal lobe white matter in HD compared to controls. Marked increases in global brain water content were found in the white matter, specifically in parietal areas, in HD patients compared to controls. Although the global water content in the gray matter did not differ between the two groups, regional increases of brain water content in particular in parieto-temporal gray matter areas were observed in HD patients. No relevant brain hydration changes were revealed before and after hemodialysis. Whereas longer duration of dialysis vintage was associated with increased water content in parieto-temporal-occipital regions, lower intradialytic weight changes were negatively correlated with brain water content in these areas in HD patients. Worse cognitive performance on an attention task correlated with increased hydration in frontal white matter.

40|$|By {{operating}} {{as both a}} subunit of the cadherin complex and {{a key component of}} Wnt signalling, β-catenin constitutes the lynchpin between cell:cell contact and transcriptional regulation of proliferation to co-ordinate epithelial <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> and regeneration. Integration of multiple growth-regulatory inputs with β-catenin signalling has been observed in cancer-derived cells, yet the existence of pathway cross-talk in normal cells is unknown. Using a highly-regenerative normal human epithelial culture system that displays contact-inhibition, we demonstrate that the RTK-driven MAPK and Wnt/β-catenin signalling axes form a bidirectional positive-feedback loop to drive cellular proliferation. We show that β-catenin both drives and is regulated by proliferative signalling cues and its down-regulation coincides with the switch from proliferation to contact-inhibited quiescence. We reveal a novel contextual interrelationship whereby positive and negative feedback between three major signalling pathways EGFR/ERK, PI 3 K/AKT and Wnt/β-catenin enable autocrine-regulated <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> as an emergent property of physical interactions between cells. Our work has direct implications for normal epithelial <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> and provides insight as to how dysregulation of these pathways may drive excessive and sustained cellular growth in disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of neoplastic disease still lays its foundations on {{the detection of}} <b>altered</b> <b>tissue</b> morphology. Most importantly, cancer begins, at least in many cases as a disease with <b>altered</b> <b>tissue</b> pattern formation. It is therefore rather surprising that the issue regarding the possible mechanistic role of such property in the pathogenesis of cancer has received relatively little attention so far. To be more specific, {{we need to ask}} the following question: is <b>altered</b> <b>tissue</b> pattern formation a mere bystander, with its pervasive presence along the entire carcinogenic sequence, or does it play a role in fuelling this process? Pathways related to morphogenesis and to the establishment of cell polarity will be considered for their possible mechanistic involvement in early phases of neoplastic disease. Evidences and hypotheses relating <b>altered</b> <b>tissue</b> pattern formation to the emergence of the tumor microenvironment and to neoplastic progression will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAlthough TGFβ is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of proliferation, epithelia lacking the essential receptor (TβRII) for TGFβ signaling display normal <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis.</b> By studying asymptomatic TβRII-deficient stratified epithelia, we show that <b>tissue</b> <b>homeostasis</b> is maintained by balancing hyperproliferation with elevated apoptosis. Moreover, rectal and genital epithelia, which are naturally proliferative, develop spontaneous squamous cell carcinomas with age when TβRII is absent. This progression {{is associated with a}} reduction in apoptosis and can be accelerated in phenotypically normal epidermis by oncogenic mutations in Ras. We show that TβRII deficiency leads to enhanced keratinocyte motility and integrin-FAK-Src signaling. Together, these mechanisms provide a molecular framework to account for many of the characteristics of TβRII-deficient invasive SQCCs...|$|R
