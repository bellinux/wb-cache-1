40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} {{following}} {{the end of}} the Second World War and the Libération, a high value was given to civilian input in military affairs in France. Many members of the most prestigious national academic institutions (including Institut de France, Académie nationale de médecine, Collège de France, Ecole polytechnique, Institut Pasteur, Ecole vétérinaire d’Alfort, Institut du radium, Institut national d’hygiène, Institut du cancer) were given the unprecedented opportunity to contribute to future military endeavours regarding <b>biological,</b> chemical <b>and</b> nuclear warfare, through a new pluralistic commission. This 1947 Commission médicale de défense contre la guerre moderne was a scientific commission, defining its agenda, {{under the supervision of the}} Ministère des armées. Its mission was to understand how to prevent and cure lesions or disorders caused by the then new <b>atomic,</b> chemical <b>and</b> <b>biological</b> weapons. On the basis of first hand archival materials from Institut Pasteur and from the French Ministry of Defence, we shall focus on the achievements of the subcommissions dedicated to research on biolog- ical and chemical weapons, and will examine the extent to which the expected military and civilian outcomes of this explicitly dual research program, have been effective. Noting that the German military had discovered nerve gases through earlier research on insecticides, and that the English military had found remedies against arsenical and mercurial intoxications through earlier research on vesicants, the French military gave these subcommissions the mission to explore a wide range of chemical substances <b>and</b> <b>biological</b> agents, <b>and</b> their potential effects on human health, but also on crops or animals.

40|$|Technological {{progress}} {{comes with}} a dark side where good ideas and intentions produce undesirable results (extreme downsides include <b>atomic</b> <b>and</b> <b>biological</b> weapons). The many and various unexpected outcomes of technology span humorous to bizarre, to situations that threaten human survival. Development can be positive for some, but negative and isolating for others (e. g. older or poorer people). Progress is often transient, as faster electronics and computers dramatically shorten retention time of data, knowledge, and information loss (e. g. even photos may be unreadable within a generation). Progress and globalization are also destroying past languages and cultures. Advances cut across all areas of science and life, and the scope is vast from biology, medicine, agriculture, transport, electronics, computers, long-range communications, to a global economy. Reliance on technology causes unexpected technology-driven vulnerability to natural events (e. g. intense sunspot activity) that could annihilate advanced societies by destroying satellites or power grid distribution. Similarly, progress of electronics and communication has produced a boom industry in cybercrime, and cyberterrorism. Medical technology offers improvements in health, but can include many drug-related side effects and mutagenic changes. Over enthusiasm in creating a global food economy is devastating the environment and causing extinction of species, just to support an excessive human population. A diverse coverage of such consequences is consciously presented at a level designed for an intelligent, but non-scientific, readership. It includes suggestions for positive future progress with essential planning, investment, and political commitment. Failure to respond implies human extinction...|$|R

In 1972, in recognition of the threat <b>biological</b> <b>and</b> toxin weapons posed humanity, the international community met in Geneva to sign the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (<b>Biological)</b> <b>and</b> Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction. However, this agreement has proven unable to prevent member states from possessing <b>biological</b> <b>and</b> toxin weapons. Serious inadequacies of the Convention include the ambiguous nature of the text of the Convention, the allowance of <b>biological</b> <b>and</b> toxin agents for research for defensive purposes, a lack of verification provisions and a lack of provisions in the text to regulate advances in the biotechnology field.
