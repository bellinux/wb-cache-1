5|$|According to Suetonius, Domitian wholly feigned his {{interest}} in arts and literature, and never bothered to acquaint himself with classic authors. Other passages, alluding to Domitian's love of epigrammatic expression, suggest {{that he was in}} fact familiar with classic writers, while he also patronized poets <b>and</b> <b>architects,</b> founded artistic Olympics, and personally restored the library of Rome at great expense after it had burned down.|$|E

5|$|Queluz's {{architecture}} {{is representative of}} the final extravagant period of Portuguese culture that followed the discovery of Brazilian gold in 1690. From the beginning of the 18th century many foreign artists <b>and</b> <b>architects</b> were employed in Portugal to satisfy the needs of the newly enriched aristocracy; they brought with them classical ideas of architecture which derived from the Renaissance. In its design, Queluz is a revolt against the earlier, heavier, Italian-influenced Baroque which preceded the Rococo style throughout Europe.|$|E

50|$|Nicolao Civitali (1482 - after 1560) was an Italian {{sculptor}} <b>and</b> <b>architect,</b> {{active in}} his native Lucca. He {{was the son of}} the sculptor Matteo. His son, Vincenzo Civitali, was also a local engineer <b>and</b> <b>architect.</b>|$|R
5|$|Scotland in {{this era}} {{produced}} {{some of the most}} significant British artists <b>and</b> <b>architects.</b> The influence of Italy was particularly significant, with over fifty Scottish artists <b>and</b> <b>architects</b> known to have travelled there in the period 1730–80. Many painters of {{the early part of the}} eighteenth century remained largely artisans, like the members of the Norie family, James (1684–1757) and his sons, who painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes. The painters Allan Ramsay (1713–84), Gavin Hamilton (1723–98), the brothers John (1744–1768/9) and Alexander Runciman (1736–85), Jacob More (1740–93) and David Allan (1744–96), mostly began in the tradition of the Nories, but were artists of European significance, spending considerable portions of their careers outside Scotland, and were to varying degree influenced by forms of Neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} jointly {{designed}} by engineering firm G. Maunsell & Partners <b>and</b> <b>architects</b> William Halford & Partners. The prestressed concrete design was relatively new for Western Australia, where road bridges had traditionally been built from timber frameworks. The bridge is arched along its length, with a vertical curve {{of up to}} 4% grade.|$|E
5|$|After {{visiting his}} ancestral home in Suzhou, Pei created a design {{based on some}} simple but nuanced {{techniques}} he admired in traditional residential Chinese buildings. Among these were abundant gardens, integration with nature, and consideration {{of the relationship between}} enclosure and opening. Pei's design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like the large central space in his East Building of the National Gallery. Openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view the natural scenery beyond. Younger Chinese who had hoped the building would exhibit some of Cubist flavor for which Pei had become known were disappointed, but the new hotel found more favour with government officials <b>and</b> <b>architects.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pierre Guariche (1926-95) was a French designer, {{interior}} decorator <b>and</b> <b>architect.</b> He {{is perhaps best}} known for the residential lights that he designed for Pierre Disderot in the 1950s, but he was also an innovative furniture designer <b>and</b> <b>architect.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pier Luigi Nervi (June 21, 1891 - January 9, 1979) was an Italian {{engineer}} <b>and</b> <b>architect.</b> He {{studied at}} the University of Bologna graduating in 1913; Dr Nervi taught {{as a professor of}} engineering at Rome University from 1946 to 1961 and is known worldwide as a structural engineer <b>and</b> <b>architect</b> <b>and</b> for his innovative use of reinforced concrete.|$|R

5|$|As the 20th century dawned, {{builders}} <b>and</b> <b>architects</b> concentrated {{their efforts}} in the northern half of the district, primarily on commercial structures as the downtown area was no longer popular as a place for new residences. Monument Square, created in 1891 when a statue of Columbia was erected atop the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in the triangular area formed by the intersection of Broadway, River and Second streets, became a new focal point of development. There the McCarthy Building on Monument Square, and the similar National State Bank and Ilium buildings on Broadway, all built in 1904, show the decorative influence of the era's revival styles. Proctor's Theater, ten years later on Fourth Street, continued the tradition.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, writers, artists, <b>and</b> <b>architects</b> in Italy {{were well}} aware of the transformations that were taking place and were using phrases such as modi antichi (in the antique manner) or alle romana et alla antica (in the manner of the Romans and the ancients) to {{describe}} their work. In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (ancient) and to the Christian period as nova (new). From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.|$|E
5|$|George Sears Greene (May 6, 1801 – January 28, 1899) was a civil {{engineer}} and a Union general during the American Civil War. He {{was part of the}} Greene family of Rhode Island, which had a record of distinguished military service to the United States. He first served in the Army from 1823 to 1836 after graduating second from his class at West Point. As a civilian, he was a founder of the American Society of Civil Engineers <b>and</b> <b>Architects</b> and was responsible for numerous railroads and aqueduct construction projects in the northeastern United States.|$|E

In New York City, he designed the Croton Aqueduct reservoir in Central Park and the enlarged High Bridge over the Harlem River. He was one of twelve founders in New York City of the American Society of Civil Engineers <b>and</b> <b>Architects.</b> While {{on a trip to}} Maine for railroad surveying, he met Martha Barrett Dana, daughter of Samuel Dana, a prominent Massachusetts politician. They were married in Charlestown, Massachusetts, on February 21, 1837. They had six children together, including four sons (three of them later served in the military), one daughter, and one son who died in infancy.|$|E

5|$|Other {{countries}} soon saw {{the advantage}} of camouflage, and established their own units of artists, designers <b>and</b> <b>architects.</b> The British established a Camouflage Section in late 1916 at Wimereux, and the U.S. followed suit with the New York Camouflage Society in April 1917, the official Company A of 40th Engineers in January 1918 and the Women's Reserve Camouflage Corps. The Italians set up the Laboratorio di mascheramento in 1917. By 1918 de Scévola was in command of camouflage workshops with over 9,000 workers, not counting the camoufleurs working at the front itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} design {{plans for the}} station called for a clean utilitarian structure typical of metro stations of that period. Due {{to the efforts of}} the city's chief architect Mykola Zharikov, the design was scrapped in favor of one that resembles an ancient Kievan Rus' temple by Borys Zhezherin, Vadym Zhezherin, and Zharikov himself. Such a design was a particularly risky feat, since Ukraine {{was a part of the}} secular Soviet Union at the time of the station's construction. Vadym Zhezherin and Mykola Zharikov, among the other artists <b>and</b> <b>architects</b> of the station, were bestowed the State Prize of Ukraine in the Field of Architecture for their work in 1991.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is divided}} into three {{horizontal}} sections, <b>and</b> <b>architects</b> considered the rivers and other natural characteristics of the St. Louis area when designing the park. The northern limestone wall represents the Mississippi River bluffs, while the southern snaking meander wall stands is inspired by the region's waterways. Between the two zones are the rain gardens, larger trees, and larger sculptures, an area that meant to represent a floodplain. The main paths of the park were plotted to match the locations of alleyways that park designers saw in a 1916 Sanborn map.|$|E

5|$|The two {{principal}} drafters <b>and</b> <b>architects</b> of the covenant of the League of Nations were Lord Robert Cecil (a British diplomat), and Jan Smuts (a South African statesman). Smuts' proposals included {{the creation of}} a Council of the great powers as permanent members and a non-permanent selection of the minor states. He also proposed {{the creation of a}} Mandate system for captured colonies of the Central Powers during the war. Cecil focused on the administrative side, and proposed annual Council meetings and quadrennial meetings for the Assembly of all members. He also argued for a large and permanent secretariat to carry out the League's administrative duties.|$|E
5|$|The work {{is widely}} admired by biologists, anthropologists <b>and</b> <b>architects</b> among others, but less often read than cited. Peter Medawar {{explains}} this as being because it clearly pioneered {{the use of}} mathematics in biology, and helped to defeat mystical ideas of vitalism; but that the book is weakened by Thompson's failure to understand the role of evolution and evolutionary history in shaping living structures. Philip Ball and Michael Ruse, on the other hand, suspect that while Thompson argued for physical mechanisms, his rejection of natural selection bordered on vitalism.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 1930s, various Soviet {{publications}} questioned the known historical facts regarding the age of the Cathedral. The publications stressed that the medieval building had undergone major reconstructions and that little of the original Byzantine-style cathedral was preserved. This wave of questioning led to the demolition of the monastery and its replacement with a new administrative centre for the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (previously located in the city of Kharkiv). Before its demolition (June 8–July 9, 1934), the structure was carefully studied by T.M. Movchanivskyi and K. Honcharev from the recently purged and re-organized Institute of Material Culture of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. On the basis of their survey, the cathedral was declared to belong primarily to the Ukrainian Baroque style, rather than to the twelfth century as was previously thought, and thus did not merit preservation due to its lack of historical and artistic value. This conclusion backed up the Soviet authorities' plans to demolish the entire monastery. Local historians, archaeologists, <b>and</b> <b>architects</b> agreed to the monastery's demolition, although reluctantly. Only one professor, Mykola Makarenko, refused to sign the demolition act; he later died in a Soviet prison.|$|E
