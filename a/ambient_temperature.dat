5|$|Scientists once {{believed}} that the distinct status of some subspecies could be justified by morphology, including {{the size of the}} mane. Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the Barbary lion and Cape lion, which had the thickest, most extensive manes amongst wild lions. Research results indicate that environmental factors such as average <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> influence the colour and size of a lion's mane. The cooler <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> in European and North American zoos, for example, may result in a heavier mane. Thus the mane is not an appropriate marker for identifying subspecies. The males of the Asiatic subspecies, however, are characterised by sparser manes than average African lions.|$|E

25|$|The use of countercurrent heat {{exchange}} with blood flow allows for regulated conservation/ elimination of heat of appendages.

25|$|At low <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{the common}} ostrich {{utilizes}} feather flattening, which conserves body heat through insulation. The low conductance coefficient of air allows less heat {{to be lost}} to the environment.

These feather heavy {{areas such as the}} body, thighs and wings do not usually vary much from <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> due to this behavioural controls. This ostrich will also cover its legs to reduce heat loss to the environment, along with undergoing piloerection and shivering when faced with low <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures.</b>|$|R
5|$|With {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 0.16%, methoxyflurane {{is an extremely}} potent anesthetic agent. It is a powerful analgesic agent at well below full anesthetic concentrations. Because of its low volatility and very high boiling point (104.8°C at 1atmosphere), methoxyflurane has a low vapor pressure at <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> and atmospheric pressure. It is therefore quite difficult to vaporize methoxyflurane using conventional anesthetic vaporizers.|$|E
5|$|Dwarf lemurs are {{the only}} {{primates}} known to hibernate for extended periods. Unlike other hibernating mammals from temperate regions, which have to awaken regularly for a few days, dwarf lemurs experience five months of continuous deep hibernation (May through September). Before and after this deep hibernation, there are two months (April and October) of transition, where they will forage on a limited basis to reduce demands on their fat reserves. Unlike any other hibernating mammal, the body temperature of hibernating dwarf lemurs will fluctuate with the <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> rather than remaining low and stable.|$|E

Persistent serotonergic deficits were observed after binge like treatment in a warm environment and in both serotonergic and dopaminergic nerve endings at high <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b> Oxidative stress cytotoxicity {{and an increase in}} frontal cortex lipid peroxidation were also reported.|$|E

The female spends the night incubating during this period, while the male roosts near the nest. Eggs hatch at the same time, after a short incubation period lasting 11–14days, and exceptionally {{for as many as}} 17 or as few as 9.

5|$|Thin {{film with}} diffuse reflector, {{based on the}} top two layers of a buttercup's petals. The {{brilliant}} yellow gloss derives from a combination, rare among plants, of yellow pigment and structural coloration. The very smooth upper epidermis acts as a reflective and iridescent thin film; for example, in Ranunculus acris, the layer is 2.7 micrometres thick. The unusual starch cells form a diffuse but strong reflector, enhancing the flower's brilliance. The curved petals form a paraboloidal dish which directs the sun's heat to the reproductive parts at {{the centre of the}} flower, keeping it some degrees Celsius above the <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|E

5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature,</b> this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{importance}} of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature,</b> wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between {{the air and the}} snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute Qm, the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to Qm.|$|E

5|$|In {{most cases}} the {{electrons}} are close enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even {{when there is a}} significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|E

5|$|As they {{evolved from}} lunged fish, {{amphibians}} {{had to make}} certain adaptations for living on land, including {{the need to develop}} new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air.

Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.|$|E
