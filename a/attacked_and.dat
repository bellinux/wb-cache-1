40|$|To {{solve the}} problem of {{knowledge}} expression in SCADA network <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> defence system, a new knowledge expression method of SCADA network <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> defence based on factor state space is presented. Combined with factor space definition and the formal description of factor state space expression <b>and</b> analyzing <b>attack</b> factors, skill <b>and</b> <b>attack</b> aim, analysis <b>and</b> expression method of network <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> defense factors is developed. On the basis of analysis and expression of network <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> defense factors, equivalence class partition formal description is presented. For illustration, an attack simulation experiment is utilized to show the feasibility of the proposed method in solving network <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> defence knowledge expression. By introducing factor space canes, objects class can be represented. Empirical results show that our proposed method can effectively improve accuracy of attack classification. Knowledge expression method based on factor state space can effectively solve complexity of knowledge expression in network <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> defence system and provides a new method for solving similar application...|$|R

5|$|Another {{threat to}} {{albatrosses}} is introduced species, such as rats or feral cats, which directly attack albatrosses or their chicks and eggs. Albatrosses {{have evolved to}} breed on islands where land mammals are absent and have not developed defences against them. Even species as small as mice can be detrimental; on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan albatrosses are <b>attacked</b> <b>and</b> eaten alive by introduced house mice. Introduced species can have other indirect effects: cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island, threatening the Amsterdam albatross; on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat.|$|E
5|$|Ariadne {{served with}} the {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet {{for the majority of}} her career. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was used to patrol the Heligoland Bight. On 28 August, the British Royal Navy attacked the patrol line, and in the ensuing Battle of Heligoland Bight, a pair of battlecruisers <b>attacked</b> <b>and</b> sank Ariadne. Some 200 of her crew were killed in the battle; only 59 survivors were pulled from the sea.|$|E
5|$|At that time, {{the newly}} {{restored}} Byzantine Empire, {{under the leadership}} of Michael VIII Palaiologos, sought to recover Euboea, which was the major Latin insular possession in the Aegean Sea and a base for piratical activity directed against his lands. Furthermore, along with the Principality of Achaea it presented the major obstacle to his complete recovery of Greece. Already in 1269/1270, a Byzantine fleet under Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos had <b>attacked</b> <b>and</b> captured many Latin nobles, the town of Oreos.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, several dynamic ID-based {{remote user}} {{authentication}} schemes have been proposed.

However, {{we will show}} that Wen and Li's scheme cannot withstand insider <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> forward secrecy, does not provide anonymity for the users, and inefficiency for error password login.

30|$|In 2005, Yang et al. (2005) {{proposed}} a new SIP authentication {{scheme based on}} Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, but Huang and Wei (2006) found that Yang et al.’s scheme has high computational costs and {{proposed a}}n efficient SIP scheme. To improve the efficiency, Durlanik and Sogukpinar (2005) and Wu et al. (2009) also proposed SIP authentication protocols using the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), respectively. Unfortunately, Yang et al.’s and Huang et al.’s schemes suffer from the off-line password guessing attack (Jo et al. 2009), while Durlanik et al.’s and Wu et al.’s schemes are vulnerable to the Denning-Sacco <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> the off-line password guessing attack (Yoon et al. 2010 b). Yoon et al. (2010 b) presented an improved scheme to overcome these weaknesses. But Liu and Koenig pointed out that Yoon et al.’s SIP authentication scheme is still insecure against the off-line password guessing <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> the insider <b>attack</b> (Liu <b>and</b> Koenig 2011). Applying one-way hash function and the fast logic operations like exclusive-or, Tsai (2009) proposed a nonce based SIP authentication scheme. Later on, Yoon et al. (2010 a) demonstrated that their scheme is vulnerable to Denning-Sacco attack, off-line password guessing <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> stolen-verifier <b>attack,</b> <b>and</b> proposed a new SIP authentication scheme. In 2012, Xie (2012) demonstrated that Yoon et al.’s scheme is still vulnerable to stolen-verifier <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> off-line password guessing <b>attack,</b> <b>and</b> proposed an improvement of Yoon et al.’s scheme, but Farash and Attari (2013) found that Xie’s protocol is also insecure against impersonation <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> off-line password guessing <b>attack,</b> <b>and</b> then they proposed an improved scheme to resolve these problems.|$|R
