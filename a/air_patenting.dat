40|$|Newfactan � is a {{domestically}} developed, bovine lung-derived, semi-synthetic surfactant. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the clinical efficacy of Newfactan � with that of Surfacten � in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Newfactan � or Surfacten � was randomly allocated to 492 newborn infants who were diagnosed as RDS and required surfactant instillation in four participating hospitals. The comparisons were made individually in two subsets of infants by birth weight (< 1, 500 g group [n= 253] and ≥ 1, 500 g group [n= 239]). Short-term responses to surfactant and acute complications, such as the total doses of surfactant instilled, response type, extubation rate, ventilator settings, changes in respiratory parameters, <b>air</b> leak, <b>patent</b> ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage, and mortality during the 96 hr after surfactant instillation were measured.

There were no significant differences in demographic and perinatal variables, shortterm responses to surfactant and acute complications, and long-term outcome and complications between Newfactan � and Surfacten � in both birth weight groups.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 10 - 12, 1972 / International Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaRedundant area coding was {{proposed}} in an <b>Air</b> Force <b>patent,</b> James Maier inventor, {{to relieve the}} long integration time required to transmit a reconnaissance photograph through narrow-band communication circuits where upper limits of 4800 to 9600 bits/second prevail. Further development by Radiation Systems Division was funded by Rome Air Development Center’s Reconnaissance and Intelligence Division. Mr. Lawrence Gardenhire developed the analysis curves used. As redundant area coding was conceived, unimportant areas were reduced by applying different orders of resolution throughout one frame of imagery, by blanking redundant areas, or by applying encoding so one frame could consist of areas basically unchanged and areas coded to represent special land such as Forest or desert. What evolved were techniques of applying redundant reduction algorithms in both areas, producing a low/ high resolution picture. Where 3 to 1 reduction ratios were optimum for an average “busy” picture, reduction ratios exceeding 10 to I have been realized. A 9 x 9 inch, 2000 x 2000, 6 -bit grey level picture that required 42 minutes to send at a 9600 -bit/ second rate, or about 14 minutes for a 3 to 1 reduction, can now be sent in 5 to 6 minutes.

40|$|Focusing {{specifically}} on regulation of coal-fired power plants, we examine how technological innovation by early adopters influences {{the timing of}} new environmental regulation in non-innovating countries. We build a general equilibrium model of an open economy to identify the political-economy determinants of regulation. With a newly created dataset of SO 2 and NOx regulations for coal-fired power plants and a patent-based measure of the technology frontier, we estimate the determinants of environmental regulation diffusion. Our findings {{support the hypothesis that}} international economic integration eases access to environmentally friendly technologies and leads to earlier adoption, ceteris paribus, of regulation in non-innovating countries. However, we also find evidence that domestic trade protection promotes earlier adoption allowing shifts of regulatory costs to domestic consumers. Furthermore, international market power permits large countries to shift costs to foreign consumers.

The results from the infants with HMD showed that: a) From the fourth or fifth day, the surface tension of lung extracts fell, inclusion bodies became more plentiful, and <b>air</b> saccules with <b>patent</b> airways could be inflated with air, even when severe changes due to BPD were present. b) There was a highly statistically significant correlation between the most serious lesions of BPD [...] damage to airways followed by excessive repair and fibrosis [...] and the use of high (greater than 35 cm H 2 O) peak airway pressures during mechanical ventilation in life. c) Damage due to oxygen breathing could not be reliably identified although some of the lesions, particularly edema and fibroplasia in intersaccular septa, may have been caused by oxygen. d) Evidence of pulmonary hypertension was present in infants surviving {{for more than a month}} with severe lung damage, and the ductus arteriosus was always open.

50|$|The first microdermabrasion {{unit was}} {{developed}} in Italy in 1985, using small inert aluminium oxide crystals to abrade the skin. In 1986, other European markets had introduced the technology, which was immediately adopted by physicians for mechanical exfoliation. There were 10 microdermabrasion units {{on the market in}} Europe by the end of 1992. In 1996, Mattioli Engineering partnered with one of the Italian designed machines and started working towards meeting FDA requirements for the USA. By the end of 1996, the FDA issued the first approval letter for microdermabrasion machines. In January 1997, the first microderm machine was being sold and marketed in the US. The diamond tip was introduced in 1999 and the bristle tip brush was introduced in 2005. The first standard vacuum based microdermabrasion system called Vacubrasion was introduced in 2012 in the U.S. and world markets, and provides diamond tip exfoliation and suction. Vacubrasion's <b>patented</b> <b>air</b> regulator delivery system was designed and underwent extensive testing by U.S. dermatologists and physicians. Its straightforward design revolutionized microdermabrasion to permit use of almost any type of suction source (primarily retail brand vacuums with a 1.25 inch standard round hose such as Eureka, Stanley vacuums) with a non-disposable, attached electroplated fine diamond abrasive tip. While traditional, older crystal based microdermabrasion and home microdermabrasion systems are not infrequently fraught with clogging issues and potential loss of suction, the crystal-free Vacubrasion systems utilize a universal, larger and more powerful suction source that avoids many of these issues.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report on a study which has been carried out on a timber floor {{construction}} above a ground-supported concrete slab, which was used in small detached houses built in Sweden during the period 1960 - 1990. This method of building has turned out to be a risky construction nowadays, but there are 800, 000 houses built this way in Sweden. Design/methodology/approach – By using the <b>patented</b> <b>Air</b> Gap Method inside building constructions, harmful water can be dried out. The method ventilates air gaps inside walls and floors with an air flow driven by thermal buoyancy caused by a heating cable in the vertical air gaps. The drying out process has been studied both by measuring the moisture level in the slab and also by measuring the humidity transport and comparing this with air flow measurements. Findings – The paper shows that the Air Gap Method manages to dry out water from both the slab and the overlaying wooden construction. The study shows also that the relative humidity (RH) levels in the air space below the floor are reduced in a significant way, thus minimizing mould growth. It is also shown that a thin layer of concrete upon floor beams prevents mould to grow even in a humid situation. Research limitations/implications – The research reported in this paper is only concerned with timber-framed small detached houses. Similar studies of apartment buildings are ongoing. Practical implications – The Air Gap Method can thus be useful in the context of renovating a water damaged house of this type built during this 30 -year period. The method provides a possibility of drying out such damage without a separate drying period. The inhabitants could therefore be able to use a renovated water-damaged kitchen six/eight weeks earlier compared to ordinary building methods. Originality/value – The paper is useful because it provides better understanding of the mechanism of RH inside a building construction and how this parameter could be lowered. The paper is also useful in the context of renovating water-damaged small detached houses built by the risky method of construction used in the last decades of the twentieth century.
