40|$|Based on {{experimental}} {{data from a}} drilling process monitoring system instrumented with a hydraulic rotary drill rig in fill-weathered granite formation, the diamond penetrating energy was analyzed. The result shows that {{the distribution of the}} penetrating energy in fill-weathered granite formation agrees with that in common weathered granite formation. A negative correlation between the viscous energy, kinetic energy, total penetrating energy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> degree of granite existed, and a positive correlation between the thrust force energy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> degree was presented, which indicates that there is a well response between <b>the</b> penetrating energy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> degree of rock. However, the kinetic energy, thrust force energy and viscous energy are limited in identification of formation because of different effects in various drilling modes. The specific energy of diamond drilling (SEDD) increased with <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> degree of rock <b>and</b> <b>the</b> values of SEDD can be classified into corresponding range according to <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> degree of rock. It is shown that the SEDD in rotary drilling is apparently less than the specific energy of percussive drilling (SEPD) in both fill soil and very strongly weathered granite formation. Reversely, the SEDD is much more than the SEPD in lightly weathered hard rock. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|A soft {{opening weekend}} {{was held for}} the media and {{reserved}} guests, starting on May 28, 2010. The park had two opening ceremonies that took place on June 16 and on June 18, 2010.

The ceremony, which was produced by Universal Orlando Events Production in conjunction with Thinkwell Group, concluded with a fireworks display and a performance by the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by original series' composer John Williams.

The city centre experiences the same climatic effects as other larger cities with higher wind speeds, more fog, less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding, open land.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the mundane}} subject was {{constant}} throughout the Haystack series, the underlying theme {{may be seen}} as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception as the time of day, the seasons <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series. The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.|$|E
5|$|By late on September15, the {{hurricane}} {{was beginning to}} affect the North Carolina coastline. The high winds near the center prompted the United States Weather Bureau to issue storm warnings {{on the morning of}} September16 into the next day. Turning northward, {{the hurricane}} weakened slightly and made landfall near Atlantic City, New Jersey, shortly before 12:00UTC on September16. The estimated barometric pressure was , suggesting hurricane-force winds of 80mph (130km/h) at landfall. This made it the first and only known hurricane to strike New Jersey since the Atlantic hurricane database's beginning in 1851. The storm structure broadened after landfall, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Weather</b> Bureau assessed one center splitting off and tracking north-northeastward into New York and Connecticut. The main center continued northwestward, weakening into a tropical storm near Trenton, New Jersey. After crossing northeastern Pennsylvania, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near Syracuse, New York on September17. The extratropical remnant persisted for another six hours before losing its identity over eastern Ontario.|$|E

Construction of cathedrals and major churches almost invariably started at the eastern arm, and then proceeded westwards, with towers erected last.|$|E
5|$|One-thousand years ago, the nomadic Timbisha (formerly called Shoshone {{and also}} known as Panamint or Koso) moved into the area and hunted game and {{gathered}} mesquite beans along with pinyon pine nuts.
