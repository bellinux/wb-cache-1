5|$|Freedom from Want was {{published}} with <b>an</b> <b>essay</b> by Carlos Bulosan {{as part of}} the Four Freedoms series.

Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request <b>an</b> <b>essay</b> contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized.
