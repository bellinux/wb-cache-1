25|$|Conventional {{crude oil}} is {{normally}} {{extracted from the}} ground by drilling oil wells into a petroleum reservoir, allowing oil to flow into them under natural reservoir pressures, although <b>artificial</b> <b>lift</b> and techniques such as horizontal drilling, water flooding and gas injection are often required to maintain production. When primary production {{is used in the}} Venezuelan oil sands, where the extra-heavy oil is about 50 degrees Celsius, the typical oil recovery rates are about 8–12%. Canadian oil sands are much colder and more biodegraded, so bitumen recovery rates are usually only about 5–6%. Historically, primary recovery was used in the more fluid areas of Canadian oil sands. However, it recovered {{only a small fraction of}} the oil in place, so it not often used today.|$|E

30|$|Nevertheless, wax {{deposits}} in wells do exist and pose {{a more complex}} problem to solve.

40|$|Well and Inflow Performance Relationship, termed TPR and IPR, {{respectively}} {{have been}} the unfailing methods to predict well performance. It is further to determine the schemes on optimising production. The main intention {{of the study is}} to explore TPR and IPR under heating treatment for heavy oil well. Klamono is a mature field which mostly has depleted wells, it produces heavy oil within 18. 5 °API (> 0. 95 g/cc oil density), and therefore, <b>artificial</b> <b>lifting</b> method is necessary. Sucker Road Pump (SRP) and Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) are the most deployed <b>artificial</b> <b>lifting</b> method in this reservoir. To boost the heavy oil production, the application of Electric Downhole Heater (EDH) in Well KLO-X 1 is being studied. Whole Klamono's production is more than 100, 000 blpd within 97 - 99 % water cut. By installing EDH, oil viscosity is decreased hence oil mobility ratio will play a role to decrease water cut. EDH is installed together with the tubing joint to simplify its application in the wellbore. The study shows that EDH application can elevate fluid (mixed oil and brine) temperature. Oil viscosity confirms a reduction from 68 to 46 cP. The gross well production is up to 12. 2 bopd due optimising its outflow performance and reducing 97. 5 to 96. 9 % water cut. The field data gives an incremental of 4. 9 bopd. The computational results only show an attainment of net oil production up to 8. 3 bopd (2 bopd incremental). The EDH works to lessen both density and viscosity as we hypothesised for the mechanism of thermally induced oil production improvement. The evaluation study on its economics aspect exhibits good result that is 1. 4 USD/bbl additional profit margin according to field data despite the challenging annual rig rent cost. Following the field data, the expected net income through analytical model revealed that this project is financially promising...|$|R
40|$|Jet pump is {{one type}} of <b>artificial</b> <b>lifts</b> and is used when depth and {{deviation}} of producing wells increases and pressure depletion occurs. In the present study, numerical analysis {{has been carried out}} to analyze the flow behavior and find the performance of the jet pump. Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes equations were solved and k-ε turbulence model was used for simulations. Water and light oil as primary fluids were used to pump water, light oil and heavy oil. The ratios of area and length to diameter of the mixing tube were considered as design parameters. The pump efficiency was considered to maximize for the downhole conditions. It was found that the increase in viscosity and density of the secondary fluid reduced efficiency of the system. Water as primary fluid produced better efficiency than the light oil. It was also found that the longer throat length increased efficiency upto 40 % if light oil was used as primary fluid and secondary fluid viscosity was 350 cSt...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of exploited oil reservoirs {{in the world}} need some form of <b>artificial</b> <b>lifting</b> to transfer crude oil to the surface. Progressing cavity pumps and electric submersible pumps are two methods commonly used to do this. These pumps are able to pump from relatively small to very large amounts, thus being suitable for many different applications. This thesis studies control functionality requirements occurred among customers operating with these pumps in oil fields. Requirements are examined and designing concepts discussed. The aim is {{to determine how the}} existing application control program used with ABB's ACS 880 industrial variable frequency converter could be improved so that it meets the customer requirements and responds to the market situation effectively. In this thesis, functionality requirements were inquired from ABB sales and marketing persons who collect information directly from customers. In addition to that, the main competitors of ABB in the field of <b>artificial</b> oil <b>lifting</b> were analysed. Order of priorities and guidelines for requested functionalities were then formed based on the collected information. The most requested topics were related to functionalities reducing the amount of sensors needed in the system. This means that the program should be able to make estimations based mainly on motor behaviour. Production monitoring possibilities and better sand cleaning functions were also widely requested. In addition to these, the monitoring of a motor's acceleration in order to detect a stuck pump was seen as an important enhancement, as was detecting gas pockets down in the well. To add new requested functionalities to the control program, pump and reservoir conditions need to be modelled better. In some cases, a lot of practical testing is also required, but monitoring improvements, for example, can be done with small modifications to the current program. Designing at least the most requested functionalities would give a good competitive edge over the main competitors...|$|R

30|$|Sucker rod pumping is a {{traditional}} and widely used method of <b>artificial</b> <b>lifting</b> in the world’s oil industry. In recent years, on the one hand, as the natural energy has been depleted and working fluid level is going down, most of old oilfields in the late development stage need deep pumping techniques to increase oil production; on the other hand, deep reservoirs are gradually being developed. For example, the average reservoir depth in Tahe oilfield of Northwest China is more than 6000  m. With the complex geological conditions and bad fluid properties, the working fluid level is very low and rapidly dropping to the limit depth of conventional sucker rod pumping system. The limit depth mainly depends on the polished rod load which increases with the pump depth. However, high polished rod load is disadvantageous to the whole system and even tends to exceed the operating range of the pumping unit. At present, aiming at the problem about how to reduce the polished rod load in the deep sucker rod pumping wells, mainly four rod load reduction techniques have been designed. They are side-flow pump, rod load reducer, fiberglass–steel sucker rod and deep pumping with small-diameter pump.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays,electrical {{submersible}} pumping(ESP) {{is becoming}} more attractive among <b>artificial</b> <b>lifting</b> methods. The purpose of the submersible pumping is to increase bottom hole pressure. Development of ESPsystems, which are deployed through production tubing is particularly important in Norway, as there are severa lhundreds of subsea wells, which are approaching to the stage, when reservoir pressure is not enough anymore to overcomepressure loss along flowpath, {{no matter how much}} was able to decrease it. This alternative deployment method of ESP systems allows to avoid utilization of heavy workoverrigs, which are expensive and time consuming, especially for subsea-­‐completed wells. Installation of ESP systems for all subsea wells, instead, can be performed from cheaper and smaller drill ships. Current study offers solution for obstacles faced by coiled tubing or wireline deployed ESPsystems, restores all the well barriers during each phase of ESPapplication, demonstrates final design of ESPassembly to be run into the existing subsea wells with horizontal Christmas tree and finally describes deployment procedure. The idea of preparation of new wells during completion for prospective possible ESPdeployment has distinctive place in the study. This permits to utilize ESP systems in a more safe and inexpensive manner in the future. </p...|$|R

40|$|Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent <b>artificial</b> <b>lifting</b> method in industry due to its high liquid flow rate in both onshore and offshore applications. As oil exploration goes deep into water, ESP equipment is facing a crucial problem of slurry erosion which may affect life and cost significantly. The wear caused by slurry erosion may bring the issue such as unbalanced side loads, severe vibration and decreased pressure head. Eventually, this phenomenon {{will lead to a}} complete system failure. In present work, a systematic study on the erosion wear has been carried out in order to give better understanding. The WJE- 1000 ESP pump manufactured by Baker Hughes has been employed in this study. During the whole procedure, 117 hours two-phase (water-sand) testing has been performed and is followed by 68 hours three-phase (watersand- air) testing. A combined analysis by combining components erosion wear measurement, pump performance testing and vibration signal process has clearly indicated the trend of erosion process on each component. Furthermore, the correlation between vibration signals collected by proximity probe and remote 3 D accelerometer provided a future direction for monitoring inaccessible downhole equipment. Finally, the conclusion that air could further accelerate ESP erosion has been found by comparing the erosion rate and vibration signals in two-phase test and three-phase test...|$|R
