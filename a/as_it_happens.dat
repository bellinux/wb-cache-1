25|$|Common cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) {{have been}} noted as regular brood parasites of L. e. excubitor in the past; for reasons unknown this has ceased since the late 1970s or so.

25|$|Islands of the West, {{a former}} name: from the Spanish name Las islas de Poniente, adopted {{in order to}} assert their {{ownership}} by Spain {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Tordesillas; the Portuguese, who (correctly, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens)</b> felt the islands fell within their sphere, instead called them Ilhas do oriente ("Islands of the East"). As the problem of longitude had not been solved, and as the islands had no spice to attract conflict, López de Legazpi successfully colonized the islands for Philip II in 1565.|$|E

25|$|Competition {{for water}} has widely increased, {{and it has}} become more {{difficult}} to conciliate the necessities for water supply for human consumption, food production, ecosystems and other uses. Water administration is frequently involved in contradictory and complex problems. Approximately 10% of the worldwide annual runoff is used for human necessities. Several areas of the world are flooded, while others have such low precipitations that human life is almost impossible. As population and development increase, raising water demand, the possibility of problems inside a certain country or region increases, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> with others outside the region.|$|E
25|$|During Savile's lifetime, {{sporadic}} {{allegations of}} child abuse were made against him dating back to 1963, but only became widely publicised after his death. Savile claimed {{the key to his}} success on Jim'll Fix It had been that he disliked children, although he later admitted to saying this to deflect scrutiny of his personal life. He did not own a computer as he did not want anybody to think he was downloading child pornography. His autobiography <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>Happens</b> (1974, reprinted as Love is an Uphill Thing, 1976) contains admissions of improper sexual conduct which appear to have passed unnoticed during his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of CPG, control by brain <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> in {{complete}} spinal cord injury, sensory feedback {{is very important in}} generating rhythmic locomotion. Firstly, locomotor movements can be initiated or blocked by some proprioceptive afferent inputs. Other work confirmed the importance of hip afferents for locomotor rhythm generation since flexion of the hip will abolish the rhythm whereas extension will enhance it. Secondly, proprioceptive afferents may participate in adapting walking speed, in determining overall cycle duration, and in regulating the structure of the step cycle’s subphases (i.e., swing, stance), which is required for speed adaptation and interlimb coupling. Thirdly, proprioceptive afferents are involved in setting the level of muscle activity through various reflex pathways.|$|E

25|$|At Cabinet on {{the morning}} of 30 October Lloyd {{reported}} that the USA was ready to move a motion at the UN condemning Israel, which had attacked Egypt in the Sinai the previous day, as an aggressor. Macleod and Heathcoat Amory approved of Lloyd's suggestion of postponing the attack by 24 hours (in breach, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens,</b> of the secret agreement between Britain, France and Israel) in order to bring the Americans on board, although they thought it unlikely to work, but it was not adopted. Macleod was telling others of his dismay that ministers had not been fully informed of the agreement with France and Israel. Either now or at some subsequent meeting Eden apologised to the Cabinet for his reticence “in time of war”, causing Macleod to snap “I was not aware that we were at war, Prime Minister!” The Anglo-French ultimatum was on the afternoon of 30 October.|$|E
25|$|In the jousting match Lancelot easily defeats {{all three}} knights. He wounds Sir Lionel, who fights him last, {{so badly that}} the crowd thinks he is dead. But the dismay of the crowd turns to awe as Lancelot's distraught cries for Sir Lionel to live {{seemingly}} resurrect a dead man. Reflecting the adoration of the crowd, Guinevere finds herself {{falling in love with}} Lancelot. She does not wish to violate her marriage vows, however, and wishes Lancelot would leave Camelot ("Before I Gaze at You Again"). By some unfortunate twist of fate, Lancelot, in spite of his boasts that he is immune to pleasures of the flesh, is also madly in love with Guinevere, and is similarly torn by the conflict between this love and his devotion to Arthur. Arthur makes Lancelot a Knight of the Round Table. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens,</b> the shrewd King Arthur guesses that Lancelot and Guinevere have feelings for each other, but hopes it will blow over, as he does not wish to upset the tranquility of Camelot. He soliloquizes to his sword Excalibur, that they will rise to the challenges they will all face, together.|$|E
25|$|The Ambaji Fair {{is held in}} the Hindu {{month of}} Bhadrapad (around August–September) at Ambaji, during a time which is {{particularly}} suitable for farmers, when the busy monsoon season is about to end. The Bhadrapad fair is held at Ambaji {{which is in the}} Danta Taluka of Banaskantha district, near the Gujarat-Rajasthan border. The walk from the bus station to the temple is less than one kilometre, under a roofed walkway. Direct buses are available from many places, including Mount Abu (45km away), Palanpur (65km away), Ahmedabad and Idar. The Bhadrapad fair is held in the centre of the Ambaji village just outside the temple premises. The village is visited by the largest number of sanghas (pilgrim groups) during the fair. Many of them go there on foot, which is particularly enriching <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> immediately after the monsoon, when the landscape is rich with greenery, streams are full of sparkling water and the air is fresh. About 1.5million devotees are known to attend this fair each year from all over the world. Not only Hindus, but some devout Jains and Parsis also attend the functions, whilst some Muslims attend the fair for trade.|$|E

500|$|<b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens,</b> {{the famous}} Romanian poet Mihai Eminescu, then journalist, {{saw one of}} the Pomul Verde {{performances}} later that summer. He records in his review that the company had six players. (A 1905 typographical error would turn this into a much-cited sixteen, suggesting a grander beginning for Yiddish theater.) He was impressed by the quality of the singing and acting, but found the pieces [...] "without much dramatic interest. His generally positive comments would seem to deserve to be taken seriously: Eminescu was known generally as [...] "virulently antisemitic." [...] Eminescu appears to have seen four of Goldfaden's early plays: a satiric musical revue Di velt a gan-edn (The World and Paradise), Der farlibter maskil un der oyfgeklerter hosid (a dialogue between [...] "an infatuated philosopher" [...] and [...] "an enlightened Hasid"), another musical revue Der shver mitn eidem (Father-in-law and Son-in-Law), and a comedy, Fishl der balegole un zayn knecht Sider (Fishel the Junkman and His Servant Sider).|$|E
