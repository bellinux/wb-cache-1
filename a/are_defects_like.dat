40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} are quasi one-dimensional nano-structures {{with unique}} electrical properties {{that make them}} prime candidates for molecular electronics, which is certainly a most promising direction in nano-technology. Early theoretical works predicted that the electronic properties of "ideal" carbon nanotubes depend on their diameter and chirality. However, carbon nanotubes are probably not as perfect as they were once thought to <b>be.</b> <b>Defects</b> <b>like</b> pentagons, heptagons, vacancies, are found to modify drastically the electronic properties of these nano-systems. The introduction of defects in the carbon network is thus an interesting way to tailor its intrinsic properties, {{in order to create}} carbon nanotube based nano-devices, leading to new potential applications in nano-electronics.

In most cases of glazes to tile applications the major problem faced <b>is</b> <b>defect</b> <b>like</b> crazing and peeling due to presences of alkalis ions in the glaze composition which can be cured by developing an alkali-free glass system for glaze composition. For the present work an alkali-free glass system with composition 65 % SiO 2, 25 % B 2 O 3, 6 % Al 2 O 3, 2 %CaO and 2 % MgO (in wt %) has been prepared by melt quenching method.

At first,perfect Nano copper models will be created using MD simulations. Then the models will be subjected to radiation and the damaged samples will be tested for mechanical characterization by tensile studies at a temperature 300 K and strain rate 1010 s- 1. The MD simulation was performed by using LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator). In this,we studied Irradiated Nano copper-cascade interactions caused by 0. 2 KeV to 3 KeV primary knock-on atoms(PKA) respectively. We found the displacement of atoms(dpa) from its lattice structure that caused for the creation of various defects within the lattice structure.

40|$|Sagopilone, a fully {{synthetic}} epothilone, is a microtubule-stabilizing agent {{optimized for}} high in vitro and in vivo activity against {{a broad range}} of tumor models, including those resistant to paclitaxel and other systemic treatments. Sagopilone development is accompanied by translational research studies to evaluate the molecular mode of action, to recognize mechanisms leading to resistance, to identify predictive response biomarkers, and to establish a rationale for combination with different therapies. Here, we profiled sagopilone activity in breast cancer cell lines. To analyze the mechanisms of mitotic arrest and apoptosis and to identify additional targets and biomarkers, an siRNA-based RNAi drug modifier screen interrogating 300 genes was performed in four cancer cell lines. Defects of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) were identified to cause resistance against sagopilone-induced mitotic arrest and apoptosis. Potential biomarkers for resistance could therefore <b>be</b> functional <b>defects</b> <b>like</b> polymorphisms or mutations in the SAC, particularly in the central SAC kinase BUB 1 B. Moreover, chromosomal heterogeneity and polyploidy are also potential biomarkers of sagopilone resistance since they imply an increased tolerance for aberrant mitosis. RNAi screening further demonstrated that the sagopilone-induced mitotic arrest can be enhanced by concomitant inhibition of mitotic kinesins, thus suggesting a potential combination therapy of sagopilone with a KIF 2 C (MCAK) kinesin inhibitor. However, the combination of sagopilone and inhibition of the prophase kinesin KIF 11 (EG 5) is antagonistic, indicating that the kinesin inhibitor has to be highly specific to bring about the required therapeutic benefit...|$|R

The systems in question <b>are</b> substitutional molecular <b>defects</b> (<b>like</b> OH-, CN-, [...] .) and off-center point-ions (like Li+, Ag+, Cu+) in various alkali-halide lattices. Some important experimental techniques for measuring low temperature relaxation (dielectric loss, electro-caloric, ITC, and PER techniques) and some representative results on OH- defects in various host lattices will be discussed. The results will {{be compared to the}} various available relaxation models (classical rate process, phonon-assisted tunneling, "dressed" tunneling). The latter model will be particularly used to explain the peculiar static and dynamic of-center properties of Ag+ ions in RbCl and RbBr, measured recently. It will further be shown how a combination of stress and field application can be used to produce "stress-tunable Orbach relaxation", which allows an accurate determination of the relative magnitudes in the rates of relaxation through different possible angles between dipole states.

40|$|An {{austenitic}} stainless steel plate was coated with a sheet of Ag–Cu filler alloy by using explosive energy to simplify the subsequent brazing operation. The coated specimen had a typically wavy interface, and there <b>were</b> no <b>defects</b> <b>like</b> void. The adhesion at the interface was retained even after heating at a temperature of more than eutectic point of the Ag–Cu binary system (1052 K), although the molten Ag–Cu alloy did not show a good wettability on the stainless steel without coating. To investigate {{the effect of the}} coating on the interfacial microstructure and the bonding strength of finally obtainable joints, two coated specimens were overlapped and then heated at 1173 K for 0. 3 ks in a low vacuum. The obtained joint had a shear strength of about 200 MPa, and broke mainly within the Ag–Cu alloy after a shear test. The joint brazed with the Ag–Cu alloy was also fabricated under the same heating conditions. Its shear strength was about 90 MPa, and the fracture position was at the Ag–Cu alloy/stainless steel interface. This indicates that the substantial bond between the Ag–Cu alloy and the stainless steel, which is achieved by explosive energy, contributes to the subsequent brazing process. Additionally, a commercially pure Ti plate was used as a substrate. In this case, the advantages of the coating process could not be recognized in the finally obtained joint. It is found that the substantial bond provided by explosive energy is canceled by the formation of a reaction layer on the brazing operation...|$|R

First, the different notions and parameters describing the diffraction of electrons by a perfect foil are introduced and discussed to some extent : wavelength, Bragg reflection, Bragg angle, dispersion surface, extinction distance, excitation error, absorption length, bright field, dark field, extinction contours, column approximation. Next, one considers planar interfaces separating two crystal parts, like stacking faults, antiphase boundaries, domain boundaries. It is shown that the amplitudes of the transmitted and scattered beam can be calculated by considering the transmitted and scattered waves emerging from the first part again as incident on {{the second part of the}} crystal foil. The image is a fringe pattern, the fringe spacing depending on the crystal and the active reflection, and not on the type of interface.

40|$|Abstract. Fast neutron {{irradiation}} of germanium {{has been used}} to study vacancy reactions and vacancy clustering in germanium as a model system to understand ion implantation and the vacancy reactions which are responsible for the apparently low n-type doping ceiling in implanted germanium. It is found that at low neutron doses (~ 1011 cm- 2) the damage produced is very similar to that resulting from electron or gamma irradiation whereas at higher doses (> 1013 cm- 2) the damage is similar to that resulting from ion implantation as observed in the region near the peak of a doping implant. Electrical measurements including CV profiling, spreading resistance, Deep-Level Transient-Spectroscopy and high resolution Laplace Deep-Level Transient-Spectroscopy have been used in conjunction with positron annihilation and annealing studies. In germanium most radiation and implantation <b>defects</b> <b>are</b> acceptor <b>like</b> and in n-type material the vacancy is negatively charged. In consequence the coulombic repulsion between two vacancies and between vacancies and other radiation-induced defects mitigates against the formation of complexes so that simple defects such as the vacancy donor pair predominate. However in the case of ion implantation and {{neutron irradiation}} it is postulated that localized high concentrations of acceptor <b>like</b> <b>defects</b> produce regions of type inversion in which the vacancy is neutral and can combine with itself or with other radiation induced acceptor <b>like</b> <b>defects.</b> In this paper the progression from simple damage to complex damage with increasing neutron dose is examined...|$|R

In the modeling process, possibility of necking in substrates and interfacial delamination between material layers is considered. The constitutive material behaviour is elastic-plastic complemented with progressive damage, based on Hooke’s Law, the J 2 yield criterion, isotropic hardening, associated flow-rule and ductile damage model are formulated to demonstrate necking behavior of substrates. In ABAQUS, three modeling techniques, namely VCCT, Cohesive Element, and XFEM, have been used to simulate interfacial delamination. The simulation results are compared with the theoretical results. A uniaxial tension test consisting of a two material laminate is simulated by using these three modeling techniques. The special modelling skills for respective modeling techniques, element type, meshing technique of each model, are also introduced. The comparison with the theoretical results shows necking in substrates and interfacial delamination are also achieved in all three models as expected. Deformation results of the simulation are very close to that of the theoretical analysis. Technique features of VCCT, Cohesive Element and XFEM in modelling of interfacial delamination are analyzed and concluded.

The result shows that the importance of the calcination and the relation between the density and porosity, when density increases the mould strength increases but the porosity decreases and it is understood that the baking temperature and the type of coating influence the surface roughness. The dimensional error result shows the percentage swelling and shrinkage errors which is non-linear, but the result shows 0. 5 % shrinkage in lateral axis, 1 % in horizontal axis, and 5 % in vertical axis.
