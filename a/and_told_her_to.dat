5|$|Buddy {{returned}} {{home and told}} Fischer to apologize to Cristina if he had offended her, and {{to tell her that}} they should be friends. It is not known if he took his father's advice, but according to one of Fischer's friends, Cisneros continued to call him after her meeting with his father. One of his friends stated that Fischer said Cisneros had offered him US$500 to get back with her daughter, but he refused. Fischer grew angry at Cisneros's insistence that he rekindle his relationship with Cristina and eventually called her <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> stop. Once Fischer's senior year started, he began to date a new girl, Marianela Caballero of San Luis Potosí, Mexico. He invited her to the homecoming dance, but they did not date for their first semester because Marianela did not want any commitments. However, by the start of their second semester, they began dating. Around that same time, Cristina also started dating another boy. Fischer told his friends that he was fine with Cristina dating other men.|$|E
5|$|A Bengali folk-tale about Shashthi {{tells of}} the {{youngest}} of seven daughters-in-law in a prosperous household who was a glutton that used to secretly steal food and then blame a black cat, which was thrashed as punishment. The black cat {{happened to be the}} vahana (mount) of Shashthi and complained about the mistreatment to the goddess, who pledged to avenge it. When the youngest daughter-in-law gave birth to a son, the cat stole the child in the night and gave it to the goddess, and did the same for her next six sons. The neighbours accused the young mother of carelessness and began to believe she might be a witch who ate her own children. Finally, when a daughter was born, the young mother decided to remain awake the whole night to resolve the mystery. She managed to catch the cat in the act of robbery and wounded it with her bracelet, but the cat escaped with the child, leaving a trail of blood. The mother followed this trail to the abode of Shashthi. There she saw her sons playing around Shashthi as the goddess held the mother's infant daughter in her arms. Shashthi explained the reason for the mother's ordeal <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> ask pardon of the cat. The mother asked the cat's pardon, which was granted, and then she promised the goddess that she would offer worship in a ritual dedicated to her, which would {{come to be known as}} the Jamai-Shasthi Vrata. The mother returned home with her children and spread the worship of the goddess, who blessed her family with children, wealth and happiness.|$|E

5|$|Janet Jackson {{was born}} in Gary, Indiana, the {{youngest}} of ten children, to Katherine Esther (née Scruse) and Joseph Walter Jackson. The Jacksons were lower-middle class and devout Jehovah's Witnesses, although Jackson would later refrain from organized religion. At a young age, her brothers began performing as The Jackson 5 in the Chicago-Gary area. In March 1969, the group signed a record deal with Motown, and soon had their first number-one hit. The family then moved to the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated {{to pursue a career}} in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio. At age seven, Jackson performed at the Las Vegas Strip at the MGM Casino. A biography revealed her father, Joseph Jackson, was emotionally withdrawn, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> address him solely by his first name as a child. She began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976. In 1977, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family and later got a recurring role on Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey from seasons three to six. Jackson also played the role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series.|$|E

25|$|In 1876, a French {{domestic}} servant, Estelle Faguette, {{reported seeing}} {{a series of}} 15 apparitions of the Virgin Mary in the bedroom where she was staying near Pellevoisin, France. When her visions allegedly began, Faguette was terminally ill with tuberculosis and near death. However, in the second apparition, she heard Mary {{tell her that she}} would be healed, and she recovered and lived until 1929. In 1983, following a medical and theological inquiry, Archbishop Paul Vignancour of Bourges recognized her recovery as having a miraculous nature. Faguette also said that during a later apparition, she saw Mary show her the design for the Scapular of the Sacred Heart <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> ask her bishop to encourage its devotional use. The Shrine of Our Lady of Pellevoisin was later constructed near the site of the apparitions. Although Pope Leo XIII eventually approved the scapular and a confraternity to spread its use, according to the University of Dayton Marian Library, neither the local archbishops of Bourges nor the Vatican have made any statement approving the Pellevoisin apparitions themselves.|$|E

The pit page, as well as the regular NBC website, also included the actual video of Aubrey Plaza pretending to drink wine and get drunk, as it was featured on the episode. Schur said for those scenes, [...] "We just gave Aubrey a camera <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> just drink wine and talk to the camera." ...|$|E

'If we all get killed here tonight, you can't say I didn't warn you.'" [...] She returned <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own cabin, followed shortly by Jones with a message from Clyde: he wanted <b>her</b> <b>to</b> fetch more food. This angered Blanche <b>and</b> she <b>told</b> Jones to tell Clyde that she wasn't going out any more that night, which in turn angered Clyde.|$|R
500|$|In mid-August, when Bryant {{returned}} from France, Reed {{met her at}} the dock <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> prepare to go to Petrograd four days later to cover the Russian Revolution. Eastman of The Masses had raised funds to pay Reed's travel expenses, and the Bell Syndicate assigned Bryant {{to report on the}} war [...] "from a woman's point of view". Leaving New York on August 17, they arrived in Petrograd, which was then the capital of Russia, about six months after the forced abdication of the last Russian czar, Nicholas II. Headed by Alexander Kerensky, the provisional government that had succeeded the czar had already survived an attempted putsch by Major General Lavr Kornilov. Bryant and Reed entered the city after the Kornilov Affair and before the Bolsheviks overthrew the Kerensky government in the October Revolution.|$|E
500|$|Klowden {{recalled}} {{later that}} [...] "he was very {{down in the}} dumps about his wife. [...] He told me how he had met Northrup.

I remember he said to me I was the only person he knew who would set up a white silk tent for him. I was rather surprised when we were driving back to LA on Sunday evening, he stopped at a florist to buy some flowers for his wife." [...] In November 1950, Northrup attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills. Hubbard blamed Klowden for the suicide bid <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> forget about him and the Foundation, but resumed the affair with her again within a month.|$|E
500|$|O'Reilly {{thought the}} {{development}} was interesting {{as the old}} Naomi would have teamed up with Dimato. Dimato later tried to bribe Naomi and Brennan encouraged {{her to go to}} the police, but she refused and gave the money back. Brennan confronted Dimato, who then cornered Naomi and threatened her for talking about the bribe. O'Reilly commented that Naomi was annoyed at Brennan's interference, as she felt she could handle Dimato. She continued, [...] "She's tough as nails. She would never admit there is danger there – and especially not to Brennan!" [...] Matt Turner (Josef Brown) later asked for Naomi's help, so the police could build a case against Dimato. Naomi gave a statement even though she was still receiving threats from Dimato and his men. Dimato later targeted Sheila, forcing Naomi to retract her statement. Matt tried to get her to change her mind, but it was only when Sheila learned what she had done <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> re-submit her statement, that Naomi agreed.|$|E

500|$|Two more relief {{parties were}} mustered to {{evacuate}} any adults who {{might still be}} alive. [...] Both turned back before getting to Bear Valley, and no further attempts were made. On April 10, almost a month since the third relief had left Truckee Lake, the alcalde near Sutter's Fort organized a salvage party to recover what they could of the Donners' belongings. [...] The belongings would be sold, with part of the proceeds used to support the orphaned Donner children. The salvage party found the Alder Creek tents empty except for the body of George Donner, who had died only days earlier. On {{their way back to}} Truckee Lake, they found Lewis Keseberg alive. According to him, Mrs. Murphy had died a week after the departure of the third relief. Some weeks later, Tamsen Donner had arrived at his cabin on her way over the pass, soaked and visibly upset. Keseberg said that he put a blanket around her <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> start out in the morning, but she died during the night.|$|E
500|$|When a {{majority}} of the nation's newspapers expressed support of the strikers, Goldman and Berkman resolved to assassinate Frick, an action they expected would inspire the workers to revolt against the capitalist system. Berkman chose to carry out the assassination, and ordered Goldman to stay behind in order to explain his motives after he went to jail. He would {{be in charge of the}} deed; she of the word. Berkman tried and failed to make a bomb, then set off for Pittsburgh to buy a gun and a suit of decent clothes. Goldman, meanwhile, decided to help fund the scheme through prostitution. Remembering the character of Sonya in Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment (1866), she mused: [...] "She had become a prostitute in order to support her little brothers and sisters...Sensitive Sonya could sell her body; why not I?" [...] Once on the street, she caught the eye of a man who took her into a saloon, bought her a beer, gave her ten dollars, informed her she did not have [...] "the knack," [...] <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> quit the business. She was [...] "too astounded for speech". She wrote to Helena, claiming illness, and asked her for fifteen dollars.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Loser Must Bow" [...] {{match between}} the Junkyard Dog and Harley Race (with Bobby Heenan and [...] "The Queen of Wrestling" [...] The Fabulous Moolah) followed. Prior to the match [...] "Mean" [...] Gene Okerlund interviewed Heenan, Race, and Moolah backstage, where Moolah {{predicted}} that Junkyard Dog {{would have to}} bow to the King as {{he is supposed to}} do. Bobby then gave Moolah the crown <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> put it on the King's head after the match, [...] "As only the Queen of Wrestling can do". Junkyard Dog came out to the ring to a big ovation in the Silverdome. During the match, the two battled back and forth, with Race even trying unsuccessfully to give the prone Dog a falling headbutt which naturally failed. Following this Race recovered enough to give the Junkyard Dog a belly to belly suplex when he was distracted by Bobby Heenan to get the win. Due to the pre-match stipulation, JYD did a little bow and then hit Race from the blindside with a steel chair to a rousing ovation from the crowd. After attacking Race, Junkyard Dog took the King's royal robe and left the ring with it in hand to a standing ovation.|$|E
