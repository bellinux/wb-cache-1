5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same, and so each time Rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child and <b>ate</b> <b>it.</b> Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children and the stone, which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of the}} Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of middle-class and educated Khmers had grown {{weary of the}} prince and welcomed the change of government. They were joined by the military, for whom {{the prospect of the}} return of American military and financial aid was a cause for celebration. Within days of his deposition, Sihanouk, now in Beijing, broadcast an appeal to the people to resist the usurpers. Demonstrations and riots occurred (mainly in areas contiguous to PAVN/Viet Cong controlled areas), but no nationwide groundswell threatened the government. In one incident at Kampong Cham on 29 March, however, an enraged crowd killed Lon Nol's brother, Lon Nil, tore out his liver, and cooked and <b>ate</b> <b>it.</b> An estimated 40,000 peasants then began to march on the capital to demand Sihanouk's reinstatement. They were dispersed, with many casualties, by contingents of the armed forces.|$|E

25|$|Comedy Against Humanity, {{which was}} an improvisational show {{inspired}} by the party game Cards Against Humanity, was one of Under the Gun Theater’s more successful shows. According to Drew Wancket of the Chicago Stage Standard, he considered it, “enormously funny, and the audience <b>ate</b> <b>it</b> up.” Wancket went on to write, “With iO moving south, Under The Gun is positioning itself {{to be the new}} force for comedy on the North Side.” The show, however, eventually closed due to fear of litigation from Cards Against Humanity. In response to the closing of their show, the theater created a different interactive show inspired by the drinking game Never Have I Ever.|$|E
25|$|Some form critics posit {{conflicting}} {{descriptions of}} manna as derived from different lore, with the description in Numbers being from the Jahwist tradition, and the description in Exodus being from the later Priestly tradition. The Babylonian Talmud {{states that the}} differences in description were due to the taste varying depending on who <b>ate</b> <b>it,</b> with it tasting like honey for small children, like bread for youths, and like oil for the elderly. Similarly, classical rabbinical literature rectifies {{the question of whether}} manna came before or after dew, by holding that the manna was sandwiched between two layers of dew, one falling before the manna, and the other after.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the fame}} of the St. Francis {{was because of}} its legendary chef, Victor Hirtzler. Hirtzler learned to cook in Strasbourg, France, and then cooked for royal courts across Europe. According to Hirtzler, he had created a dish for King Carlos I of Portugal, called La Mousse Faisan Lucullus, a mousse of Bavarian pheasant's breast and {{woodcock}} flavored with truffles, with a sauce of cognac, Madeira and champagne. The dish was so expensive, and the King <b>ate</b> <b>it</b> so frequently, that he bankrupted Portugal twice and was assassinated in 1908, followed by the downfall of Portuguese monarchy in 1910. Victor moved to New York, became the Chef of the Waldorf Hotel, and then was persuaded by {{the manager of the}} St. Francis, James Woods, to move to San Francisco.|$|E

They reached Blois and were directed to a train to Montpellier further down the track where found it overwhelmed with people trying to board. Ant shot off towards the rear of the train, before stopping by a cattle truck. Bozděch tried to open it up, but it was locked. He banged on it in the hope someone was already inside and was surprised when it was opened, revealing that the only people inside were a woman and her two daughters. The reason why Ant had been attracted to that particular carriage, was because one of the girls had been eating chocolate at the time. When she later offered him a piece, he didn't wait for it to be melted like when he was a puppy, but instead <b>ate</b> <b>it</b> excitedly.|$|E
25|$|As a major, {{he landed}} in France on Gold Beach on D-Day on 6 June 1944, as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General (DAQMG) of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, a first line TA formation, {{under the command}} of Major-General Douglas Graham. Macleod {{embarked}} on 1 June, ready for the invasion which was then postponed from 5 June to 6 June. The 50th Division, a highly experienced veteran formation which had fought in North Africa and Sicily, was tasked with capturing Arromanches, where the Mulberry artificial harbour was to be set up, {{and by the end of}} the day patrols had pushed to the outskirts of Bayeux. Macleod spent much of the day touring the beachhead area to check on progress, driving past enemy-held strongpoints, with Lieutenant Colonel “Bertie” Gibb. He later recorded that he had “a patchwork of memories” of D-Day. He could remember what he ate but not when he <b>ate</b> <b>it,</b> or that when he went to load his revolver he found his batman had instead filled his ammunition pouch with boiled sweets. British planners had expected 40% casualties on D-Day, and Macleod later recorded that he himself had fully expected to be killed, but on realising at midnight that he had survived D-Day decided that he would survive the war and see the birth of his second child in October.|$|E
500|$|German naturalist Jacob Christian Schäffer {{described}} Elvela (subsequently Helvella) purpurascens in 1774. Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen gave it {{the name}} Clavaria elveloides in 1781, reporting that it appeared in the fir tree forests around Klagenfurt in August and was common around Hüttenberg. He recorded that poor people <b>ate</b> <b>it,</b> giving it the local name hare's ear. In 1796, mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon described G.clavatus as Merulius clavatus, noting that it grew in grassy locations in woods. He noted {{it was the same}} species that Schäffer had described. The specific epithet—derived from the Latin word clava (club) and meaning [...] "club-shaped"—refers to the shape of young fruit bodies. In his 1801 Synopsis methodica fungorum, Persoon placed Merulius clavatus (recognising two varieties—violaceus and spadiceus) in the section Gomphus within Merulius.|$|E

500|$|Described by her biographer Wes Gehring as [...] "a free-spirited tomboy", {{the young}} Lombard was passionately {{involved}} {{in sports and}} enjoyed watching movies. At Virgil Junior High School, she participated in tennis, volleyball, and swimming, and won trophies for her achievements in athletics. At the age of 12, this hobby unexpectedly landed Lombard her first screen role. While playing baseball with friends, she {{caught the attention of}} the film director Allan Dwan, who later recalled seeing [...] "a cute-looking little tomboy... out there knocking {{the hell out of the}} other kids, playing better baseball than they were. And I needed someone of her type for this picture." [...] With the encouragement of her mother, Lombard happily took a small role in the melodrama A Perfect Crime (1921).

500|$|Five years later, a local historian, J.G.Hastings, wrote a manuscript, {{entitled}} The History of the Coorong, {{which proved}} {{influential in the}} development of the legend of James Brown. In it, Hastings elaborated on the poisoning incident in which Brown had supposedly been involved. By this account, Brown, responding to repeated attacks on his livestock, poisoned some flour and left it accessible to local Aboriginal people, who subsequently stole the flour and <b>ate</b> <b>it,</b> with many dying as a result. Having set the trap, Brown then rode for Adelaide to establish an alibi, swimming across the Murray mouth on his way. According to Hastings, when the case was investigated by the police, Brown's ride to Adelaide [...] "set him in good stead". Hastings wrote that at Brown's trial, it was claimed that it was impossible that Brown had poisoned the flour and appeared in Adelaide immediately thereafter.|$|E
500|$|GamePro {{magazine}} {{noted that}} [...] "Japanese players <b>ate</b> <b>it</b> up" [...] {{when it first}} released in Japanese arcades. However, GameSetWatch's Todd Ciolek believed it was released {{too late in the}} life of LaserDisc games, and that players [...] "were getting tired" [...] of the genre's gameplay. He further commented that, despite its gameplay, it was unique and charming. GamePros reviewer referred to the arcade game as a [...] "lost, laserdisc treasure", and was enthusiastic about its Mega-CD release. He called the death sequences [...] "hilarious" [...] and felt they reduced the tediousness of dying. MEGA magazine rated the Mega-CD version the number five CD game, commenting that though it lacked difficulty, it was a good showcase of the system. Prior to its Mega-CD release, Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the use of CD technology and felt it would be followed by titles with similar gameplay.|$|E

500|$|The legend narrates {{the tale}} behind the {{tradition}} of offering the Ucchishta, which otherwise is a taboo in Hinduism. Once, Shiva {{on a visit to}} Vishnu's abode Vaikuntha, saw that a few food grains (Ucchishta) had fallen on the ground after Vishnu finished his meal. [...] Shiva quickly picked up a grain and swallowed it. Unbeknownst to him, half of it stuck to his beard. [...] When he returned to his abode, the sage Narada saw the half grain on Shiva's beard, and <b>ate</b> <b>it.</b> [...] Parvati, Shiva's consort, was upset that her rightful share of Vishnu's prasad had been eaten by Narada. In a peeved mood, she went to Vishnu and complained. Vishnu pacified her saying that in the Kali Yuga (the present era as per Hindu beliefs), she would live at Puri as Vimala, and would daily eat the remnants of his food.|$|E
500|$|Kimberella {{probably}} grazed on microbial mats, but {{a selective}} predatory habit cannot be ruled out. Fedonkin reckons {{that as it}} <b>ate,</b> <b>it</b> moved [...] "backwards"; the trail thus created was destroyed by the subsequent grazing activity. [...] Conversely, Gehling et al. claim that it moved 'forwards'. [...] Fans of grooves are often found radiating from the [...] "head" [...] end of the organism; these indicate that the organism stayed in one place, and raked {{the surface of the}} microbial mat towards it by extension of its head, which bore two [...] "teeth". Gehling et al. reconstruct Kimberella as having a long neck that operated like the arm of a digger, rotating about an axis perpendicular to the sea floor in order to produce the sweep of the fan, and rotating towards and away from the animal to scrape food from the substrate to the mouth.|$|E
