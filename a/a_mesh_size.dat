50|$|MOCNESS is {{the acronym}} for Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System {{and is a}} net system for {{plankton}} in the ocean. The system is towed behind a research vessel with a speed of 1.5 knots and consists of five to twenty nets with <b>a</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> from 64 µm to 3 mm and an area of 1 to 10 m2 which are opened and closed computer controlled at desired depth. The net enables biologists to catch zooplankton and nekton in various depth horizons typically anywhere in the upper 500 m of the oceans. All MOCNESS systems are capable of sampling to 6000 meters depth (10,000 psi). The system includes a SeaBird CTD-probe to measure salinity and temperature at sampling depths, as well as optional dissolved oxygen, PAR (photosynthetically available light), transmissometry and fluorescence sensors.|$|E

Almost all of the fish were small and of the same size. The archaeologists theorize that the fish were caught in nets with <b>a</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> of about 1/4 inch. As the nets {{would have had to}} be pulled by hand, bigger fish {{would have been able to}} escape by leaping over the net or swimming away before the net was closed.

It was found that Estai was using a liner with <b>a</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> smaller than permitted by the Canadian Laws, but not by the EU laws, which {{did not have the}} same restriction about the mesh size. The net was shipped to New York City where Tobin called an international press conference on board a rented barge in the East River outside the United Nations headquarters. There, the net from Estai was displayed, hanging from an enormous crane, and Tobin used the occasion to shame the Spanish and EU governments, pointing out the small size of the holes in the net which are illegal in Canada. Spain never denied that the net was from Estai but continued to protest Canada's use of [...] "extra-territorial force". The Spanish government asked the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, for leave to hear a case claiming that Canada had no right to detain Estai.

This research aims to investigate the effect of textile reinforcement made from cantala fiber on the flexural behaviour of polymer modified mortar especially its strain hardening response. The parameters to be observed include strength, stiffness, thoughness, ductility and residual strength. The effect of the <b>meshing</b> <b>size</b> of the textile reinforcement on those properties are assesed. In addition, {{the efficacy of the}} cantala fiber textile reinforcement to improve the flexural properties of polymer modified mortar is compared with textile reinforcement made from wire mesh. The results indicate that an inclusion of short fibers could alter the post-peak behaviour of the mortar from brittle to ductile failure with softening response. Futher reinforcement of this mortar with cantala fiber textile would turn the softening response to a strain hardening response. The presence of cantala fiber textile reinforcement has minor effect on the flexural strength and stiffness. However, it significantly improve the thoughness, ductility and residual strength of the mortar.
