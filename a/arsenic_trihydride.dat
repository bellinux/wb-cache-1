40|$|In this work, a {{portable}} and reliable instrument based on manual hydride generation and subsequent ozone induced chemiluminescence analysis {{was developed and}} optimized for measurement of aqueous arsenic in drinking water. The aim {{was to develop a}} system for use in the field in villages in developing countries where water treatment systems have been installed. Consequently, it is beneficial that the system could be operated without reagent solutions or purified water. <b>Arsenic</b> <b>trihydride</b> (arsine) was generated by reaction with solid acid and solid borohydride, and then introduced to a chemiluminescence cell where the arsine was mixed with ozone to generate chemiluminescence. The measurement could be repeated with the throughput of 60 times h– 1, and the limit of detection was 0. 4 μg L– 1. The measurable arsenic concentration was up to 1 mg L– 1 for 2 mL samples. The system was evaluated for analysis of natural water samples, and the obtained data agreed well with those from ICP-MS and sequential hydride generation flow analysis. We expect this small and inexpensive instrument will be used in developing countries...|$|E
40|$|The {{fabrication}} of InGaAs n-channels in CMOS devices requires an intervening buffer layer of GaAs or InP between a Si substrate and the InGaAs channel layer, {{which has to}} be planarized to enable {{the growth of a}} channel that is free of defects due to uneven surface topography. This report discusses the material removal rates (RRs) and AsH 3 evolution observed during chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of GaAs using aq. solutions of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and silica slurries containing H 2 O 2. GaAs RRs were negligible with deionized water or with silica slurries alone. They were relatively high in aq. solutions of H 2 O 2 alone and showed a strong pH-dependence, with significantly higher RRs in the alkaline region. The addition of silica particles to aq. H 2 O 2 did not increase the GaAs RRs significantly. The evolution of <b>arsenic</b> <b>trihydride</b> (AsH 3) during the dissolution of GaAs in aq. H 2 O 2 solution was similarly higher in the basic pH range than in neutral pH or in the acidic pH range. However, no AsH 3 was measured during polishing, evidently because of the relatively high water solubility of AsH 3. In this report, GaAs removal rates and AsH 3 formation are analyzed using data from contact angle measurements, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. Reaction pathways leading to material removal are proposed...|$|E
