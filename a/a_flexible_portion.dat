40|$|AbstractThe {{translation}} {{initiation factor}} eIF 4 A is cleaved within mammalian cells infected by {{foot-and-mouth disease virus}} (FMDV).

40|$|Maintenance of {{intracellular}} disulfide equilibrium {{is necessary}} for normal functioning of proteins. In most organisms the redox status of the cell is maintained by the thioredoxin and glutathione systems. Glutaredoxins (Grxs) are the key redox active protein of the glutathione system.

Using far-UV CD and fluorescence spectroscopy, we hereby demonstrate that this flexible N-terminal region does not have any role in maintaining the stability of PfGLP 1. The free energy of stabilization of full-length and N-terminal deleted fragments was calculated using GdnHCl- and urea-induced denaturation curves.

40|$|Many {{proteins}} perform essential biological functions {{by means}} of regions that lacking specific organized structure exist as an ensemble of interconverting transient conformers. The characterization of such regions, including the description of their structural propensities, number of conformations and relative populations can provide useful insights. Prion diseases result from the conversion of a normal glycoprotein into a misfolded pathogenic isoform. The structures of mammal and chicken prion proteins show a similar fold with a globular domain and <b>a</b> <b>flexible</b> N-terminal <b>portion</b> that contains different repeated regions: octarepeats (PHGGGWGQ) in mammals and hexarepeats (PHNPGY) in chickens. The higher number of prolines in the hexarepeat region suggests that this region may retain {{a significant amount of}} residual secondary structure. Here, we report the CD, NMR and MD characterization of a peptide (2 -HexaPY) composed of two hexarepeats. We combine experimental NMR data and MD to investigate at atomic level its ensemble-averaged structural properties, demonstrating how each residue of both repeats has a different quantified PPII propensity that shows a periodicity along the sequence. This feature explains the absence of cooperativity to stabilize a PPII conformation. Nonetheless, such residual structure can play a role in nucleating local structural transitions as well as modulating intra-molecular or inter-molecular interactions...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The flow of air past an {{infinite}} shell is considered. In its undisturbed state the shell is a circular cylinder. A {{portion of the}} shell between two normal cross-sections is flexible, {{the rest of the}} shell being rigid and fixed. The <b>flexible</b> <b>portion</b> is closed by planes normal to the axis of the cylinder. In the absence of any oscillations of the <b>flexible</b> <b>portion</b> there is <b>a</b> uniform flow outside the cylinder, which has the direction of the axis of the cylinder. When the <b>flexible</b> <b>portion</b> oscillates, the uniform flow is perturbed and there is also an acoustic field generated in the space within the <b>flexible</b> <b>portion</b> with the result that there are oscillating perturbation pressures {{on both sides of the}} shell surface. A method of determining these perturbation pressures is given when the <b>flexible</b> <b>portion</b> oscillates harmonically with given frequency in a given mode. Expressions for these perturbation pressures are then used to obtain formulae for the associated generalised airforces...|$|R

Conformal antennas follow {{the shape of the}} surface on which they are mounted and generally exhibit a very low profile. When these types of antenna are mounted on aircraft, missiles and instrumented artillery shells, they reduce turbulence effects in flight, because of their low profile. Conformal Microstrip antennas have been printed on low loss dielectrical material like Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). These materials being very <b>flexible,</b> <b>a</b> significant <b>portion</b> of these can be wrapped around easily, for altering the radiation pattern. First we design a single patch on the PTFE material, with help of Powerful Computed Aided Design(PCAD) software. After analysis of the simulated result of this single patch antenna, we finalize the patch position and number of patches for achieving the omnidirectional pattern on the cylindrical surface. For achieving the omnidirectional pattern after wrapping antenna on the cylindrical body, choose the proper equidistance (in perimeter) of patches on the cylindrical surface. We will see the effect of the antenna parameters like VSWR, IMPEDANCE, REFLECTION COFFICIENT, CENTER FREQUENCY, before wrapping antenna on cylindrical surface and after wrapping antenna on cylindrical surface with cylinder radii less than one guided wavelength.
