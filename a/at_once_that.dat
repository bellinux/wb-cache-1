5|$|Richardson {{left the}} art school in 1920, and {{considered}} how else {{he might make}} a career. He briefly thought of pharmacy and then of journalism, abandoning each when he learned how much study the former required and how difficult mastering shorthand for the latter would be. He was still unsure what to do, when he saw Sir Frank Benson as Hamlet in a touring production. He was thrilled, and felt <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he must become an actor.|$|E
5|$|It was {{possible}} {{to look into the}} back yard from the road...the corpses in British uniform were lying in the yard near the buildings. They were lying in such a position that one can assume they were killed by machine-gun bursts. It struck me <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> the dead soldiers were not wearing helmets, nor did they have any equipment on them...I took pictures of the dead bodies, and the whole farm. At Thum's request these were to be placed at the disposal of the division...I believe I was already sitting there in the vehicle when Thum...told me that in the field which he had returned the equipment...the shot British soldiers were lying in a heap, from which he had {{come to the conclusion that}} a summary trial had taken place.|$|E
25|$|For Berlioz the {{experience}} of hearing the Eroica brought the last and greatest revelation {{of the power of}} instrumental music as an expressive language, along with the freedom of action with which it could be expressive. He understood <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> the symphony was a dramatic form to an extent that he had not previously realized, and that in Beethoven he saw a way to the dramatic manner in which he desired to compose.|$|E
6000|$|THE GOVERNOR. [Rather sharply] If {{any sign}} of injury to his health shows itself his case will be {{reported}} <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> <b>That's</b> fully provided for. [He rises] ...|$|R

I'll dose you with quinine to-morrow mornin', first thing," [...] said Disco, rising and {{proceeding}} forthwith {{to arrange a}} couch {{in a corner of}} the hut, which Yambo had assigned them.|$|R

25|$|The very {{aggressive}} French General Beaufre suggested <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> Anglo-French forces seize the Canal zone with airborne landings {{instead of waiting}} the planned ten days for Revise II to be worked through, and {{that the risk of}} sending in paratroopers without the prospect of sea-borne landings for several days be taken. By 3 November, Beaufre finally convinced Keightley and Stockwell of the merits of his approach, and gained the approval for Operation Telescope as Beaufre had code-named the airborne assault on the Canal zone.|$|E
25|$|Thumb was not {{appearing}} in New York City when Lavinia was hired, but {{he met her}} when he visited the Museum {{in the autumn of}} 1862. He told Barnum the same day that he {{had fallen in love with}} her. Thumb wanted Barnum on his side in this love affair (rather than on Nutt's side), so he quietly promised Barnum he would marry Lavinia in a public ceremony. Barnum knew <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> such a spectacle would make him a fortune. He told Lavinia to take Thumb's romantic interest seriously. He reminded her that the little man was rich.|$|E
25|$|If a heavy {{piece of}} pine is {{compared}} with a lightweight piece it will be seen <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> the heavier one contains {{a larger proportion of}} latewood than the other, and is therefore showing more clearly demarcated growth rings. In white pines there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work. In hard pines, on the other hand, the latewood is very dense and is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft, straw-colored earlywood.|$|E
60|$|Somerset <b>at</b> <b>once</b> {{perceived}} <b>that</b> he {{had been}} to blame in not thinking of this.|$|R

25|$|The maguari stork is {{potentially}} threatened in the Pantanal, which {{as well as}} being subject to considerable land reclamation for agriculture, has hosted increased operation of hydroelectric dams, especially in the Parana river basin. Dams retain much water during the dry season, so that natural water features downstream are more likely to dry out completely and thereby lead to a decrease in suitable foraging sites for this stork. Conversely, during the wet season, dams can lead to extensive flooding downstream caused by the release of a large volume of water <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> renders the storks’ usual foraging grounds too deep for them to stand in.|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday, September 4, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, adelantado of La Florida, {{set sail}} from the harbor of St. Augustine, and {{coasting}} north, came upon four vessels {{lying at anchor}} off {{the mouth of a}} river. These were Jean Ribault's flagship, the Trinity, and three others of his ships, which the Frenchman had left {{at the mouth of the}} St. Johns because they were too large to pass the bars in safety. One of them was flying the Admiral's flag, another the flag of the Captain. Menéndez recognized <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> the French reinforcements had arrived before him, and called a council of his captains to consider what action should be taken.|$|E
25|$|The Hall of Fame... {{owes its}} {{inception}} {{in large part to}} hard facts of physical geography. After the three buildings which were to form {{the west side of the}} quadrangle of the New York University College of Arts and Science at University Heights had been planned, it was decided, in order to enlarge the quadrangle, to push them as near as possible to the avenue above the Harlem River. But since the campus level is 170 feet above high tide, and from 40 to 60 feet above the avenue, it was seen <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> the basement stories would stand out towards the avenue bare and unsightly. In order to conceal their walls, a terrace was suggested by the architect, to be bounded at its outer edge by a parapet or colonnade.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{something}} I {{must tell}} you," [...] he said. [...] "It was Colonel Challoner who sent the boys {{up from the}} settlement with food for us, and he begs me to come home <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> <b>That's</b> a point on which I'd like your opinion; but you shall hear {{what he has to}} say." ...|$|R

25|$|I {{want to say}} <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> I frankly {{believe that}} Irving Berlin is the {{greatest}} songwriter that has ever lived.... His songs are exquisite cameos of perfection, and {{each one of them}} is as beautiful as its neighbor. Irving Berlin remains, I think, America's Schubert. But apart from his genuine talent for song-writing, Irving Berlin has had a greater influence upon American music than any other one man. It was Irving Berlin who was the very first to have created a real, inherent American music.... Irving Berlin was the first to free the American song from the nauseating sentimentality which had previously characterized it, and by introducing and perfecting ragtime he had actually given us the first germ of an American musical idiom; he had sown the first seeds of an American music.|$|E
25|$|The {{moment of}} epiphany comes {{late in the}} play. At the {{beginning}} of Scene III, Oedipus is {{still waiting for the}} servant to be brought into the city, when a messenger arrives from Corinth to declare that King Polybus of Corinth is dead. Oedipus, when he hears this news, feels much relieved, because he believed that Polybus was the father whom the oracle had destined him to murder, and he momentarily believes himself to have escaped fate. He tells this all to the present company, including the messenger, but the messenger knows that it is not true. He is the man who found Oedipus as a baby in the pass of Cithaeron and gave him to King Polybus to raise. He reveals, furthermore that the servant who is being brought to the city as they speak is the very same man who took Oedipus up into the mountains as a baby. Jocasta realizes now all that has happened. She begs Oedipus not to pursue the matter further. He refuses, and she withdraws into the palace as the servant is arriving. The old man arrives, and it is clear <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he knows everything. At the behest of Oedipus, he tells it all.|$|E
25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's a very stiff sum," [...] {{the master}} of Tilgate retorted; [...] "but perhaps I could manage it; per--haps I could manage it. We must sell the Dowlands farm <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> <b>that's</b> certain, and I must take the twelve {{thousand}} or so the land will fetch for my own use, absolutely and without restriction." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{bibliographer}} Genevieve Yost {{comments that}} [...] "E. Smith's popularity in eighteenth century England was challenged perhaps most seriously by Hannah Glasse, who admittedly is better remembered today", adding <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> Glasse is recalled mainly for {{the controversy over}} whether she actually existed, and for the recipe that people supposed started with [...] "First catch your hare." [...] Yost suggests that the book's popularity in the colonies was probably increased by the publication of an American edition. She concludes that ...|$|E
500|$|David Denby in The New Yorker {{compared}} Nolan's cinematic {{treatment of}} dreams to Luis Buñuel's in Belle de Jour (1967) and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972). He criticized Nolan's [...] "literal-minded" [...] action level sequencing compared to Buñuel, who [...] "silently pushed us into reveries and left us alone to enjoy our wonderment, but Nolan {{is working on}} so many levels of representation <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he has to lay in pages of dialogue just to explain what's going on." [...] The latter captures [...] "the peculiar malign intensity of actual dreams." ...|$|E
500|$|Ethnic music, dance, {{and costume}} were {{a large part}} of romantic ballet. At the time Giselle was written, people thought of Germany when they heard a waltz because the waltz is of German origin. Giselle makes her first {{entrance}} to the music of a waltz, and the audience would have known <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> the ballet was set in Germany. Adam wrote three waltzes for Giselle: two for Giselle and one for the Wilis. He said that the [...] "Giselle Waltz" [...] in Act I has [...] "all the German color indicated by the locality" [...] and people agreed. One critic wrote: [...] "A lovely waltz ... in the Germanic spirit of the subject".|$|E

If you were to offer me five {{thousand}} now, or ten, I couldn't stop the bally thing. You've a sporting chance of getting away if you start <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> <b>That's</b> all there is to it." ...|$|R

500|$|In 1881, Lowe {{was working}} as an [...] "office devil" [...] at the Newcastle Courant, a {{newspaper}} in New Castle, Pennsylvania. In the summer of 1881, at age 16, he played in a baseball game between the printers and the doctors of New Castle. Charley Powers, who played minor league baseball, {{was working as}} a compositor at the Courant and was selected as the captain of the printers. Lowe pleaded for a place on the team, and Powers stationed him in right field. He later recalled that [...] "the kid carried off the honors both in the field and at the bat. I saw <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> he was a born ballplayer." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers at {{the time}} of first {{publication}} met the book with undisguised scepticism and satire, but felt that Knight presented his unlikely case with ingenuity. Quentin Bell wrote in The Times Literary Supplement: [...] " [...] begins bravely and fairly by presenting the greater part of the author's case and admitting <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> 'it all sounds terribly unlikely'. It does." [...] Medical History stated: [...] "Despite the author's ingenuity the case does not stand up to careful and critical analysis and is no more 'final' than its many predecessors." [...] Since then, scholars from multiple disciplines have rejected Gorman's story as a ridiculous fantasy, and highlight many facts which contradict the version of events presented by Knight.|$|E
500|$|At 11.00 on 6 April Huré {{sent out}} patrols {{to bury the}} dead at Gueznaïa, whilst he {{reinforced}} the defences at Aïn Médiouna and directed 12 aircraft to bomb the tribesmen remaining in the area. [...] Huré left three companies to garrison Aïn Médiouna before withdrawing {{the remainder of the}} men. [...] He and his men were commended for their enthusiasm and spirit which enabled the garrison to be relieved earlier than expected. [...] Huré singled out the French Foreign Legion machine gunners for praise, noting that they had held the enemy off for four hours to cover the retreat of other units. [...] He said [...] "despite your small number... I knew <b>at</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> you would save the situation".|$|E
