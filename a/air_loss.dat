5000|$|Another {{issue with}} the wheels have been weld points that come loose, causing rapid <b>air</b> <b>loss</b> in tires and the {{potential}} for loss of control. A recall was issued after an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. However, the company has created anger among civilian owners of 2003+ Police Interceptors by refusing to honor the recall unless the vehicle is still being used in fleet service. The only way this problem could be addressed is if the civilian customer complains to a dealership about air leakage problems, an inability to balance the wheels properly, or a [...] "nibble" [...] or excessive vibration in the steering at speed. The issue is then addressed through the [...] "Customer Satisfaction Program" [...] that Ford has initiated for the same wheels. Ford ultimately resolved this issue on production cars in 2006 by introducing new 17″ steel wheels for their heavy duty models. These wheels may be of interest to those who have 2003-2005 Police Interceptors, 2003-2005 P70/P72 Commercial Heavy Duty models or 2003-2008 Standard (P73) models with 16″ steel wheels and are concerned about the safety of these wheels.|$|E

In this concern several tests have been performed for the three aforementioned conditions to measure the volumetric water content and the soil water potential distributions {{as a function of}} time and space.

40|$|The catastrophic collapses of Larsen A and B {{ice shelves}} {{on the eastern}} Antarctic Peninsula have caused their {{tributary}} glaciers to accelerate, contributing to sea-level rise and freshening the Antarctic Bottom Water formed nearby. The surface of Larsen C Ice Shelf (LCIS), the largest ice shelf on the peninsula, is lowering. This could be caused by unbalanced ocean melting (ice loss) or enhanced firn melting and compaction (englacial <b>air</b> <b>loss).</b> Using a novel method to analyse eight radar surveys, this study derives separate estimates of ice and air thickness changes during a 15 -year period. The uncertainties are considerable, but the primary estimate is that the surveyed lowering (0. 066 ± 0. 017 m yr − 1) is caused by both ice loss (0. 28 ± 0. 18 m yr − 1) and firn-air loss (0. 037 ± 0. 026 m yr − 1). The ice loss is {{much larger than the}} <b>air</b> <b>loss,</b> but both contribute approximately equally to the lowering because the ice is floating. The ice loss could be explained by high basal melting and/or ice divergence, and the <b>air</b> <b>loss</b> by low surface accumulation or high surface melting and/or compaction. The primary estimate therefore requires that at least two forcings caused the surveyed lowering. Mechanisms are discussed by which LCIS stability could be compromised in the future. The most rapid pathways to collapse are offered by the ungrounding of LCIS from Bawden Ice Rise or ice-front retreat past a "compressive arch" in strain rates. Recent evidence suggests that either mechanism could pose an imminent risk...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyCivil EngineeringKyle RidingPre-stressed {{concrete}} is {{used for}} manufacturing railroad ties. Air entrainment is used in concrete railroad ties to provide durability in freeze-thaw conditions commonly present in track. Vibration practices in pre-stressed concrete railroad tie plants could contribute to excessive <b>air</b> <b>loss</b> during manufacture and thus poor freeze-thaw resistance. Rheological properties of fresh concrete significantly influence the determination of how much air is lost during vibration. This research attempted to increase understanding {{of the effect of}} vibration on air bubble distribution and freeze-thaw resistance of concrete given certain compositions and rheological properties of concrete. The objective was achieved by examining the effect of different admixtures combinations, vibration parameters, and rheological properties on the air void system and freeze-thaw resistance of concrete. This research also proposed a method to measure rheological properties of concrete when vibrated and for concrete mixtures too stiff to measure using conventional rheology measurements. Results showed that delaying the initiation of vibration can cause significant <b>air</b> <b>loss</b> but does not necessarily decrease freeze-thaw performance of concrete. Results also showed that a majority of <b>air</b> <b>loss</b> occurs in the first 30 seconds of vibration. The types of admixtures used in the concrete mixture can significantly affect the air system and freeze-thaw durability of concrete; this effect was shown to be more pronounced in mixtures with low yield stress and plastic viscosity. While the peak vibration acceleration had a mild effect, the frequency and peak velocity of vibration did not seem to have a noticeable effect on the air system and freeze-thaw performance of concrete. Results also showed that rheological properties of stiff mixtures can be estimated by running the rheology test during vibration...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} field {{measurement}} data from Feldmoching tunnel in Munich {{were used to}} develop a model with the capability of predicting the <b>air</b> <b>losses</b> in compressed <b>air</b> tunnelling technique. In this tunnelling project, compressed air was used to control the groundwater and Shotcrete was used as temporary support. The ﬁnal permanent lining was added after completion of the temporary support and was done in free air condition. An evolutionary approach for modelling the <b>air</b> <b>losses</b> {{from the face of}} the tunnel was adopted in this study. Evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR) is a data-driven method based on evolutionary computing aimed to search for polynomial structures representing the target system. In this technique, a combination of the ge-netic algorithm (GA) and the least square method is used to search for the most feasible structures and the appropriate parame-ters of the selected model structures. Data from diﬀerent tunnel lengths were used in the training phase. The trained model was then used to predict the <b>air</b> <b>losses</b> during the excavation of the points of the tunnel data from which were not used in the train-ing stage of the modelling process. The results of the EPR model predictions were compared with the experimental data. It was shown that the suggested technique can learn and generalize the relationship between appropriate soil and tunnel parameters to predict <b>air</b> <b>losses</b> for diﬀerent geological and geometric conditions that were not previously seen in the training stage by the EPR, with a good degree of consistency with actual field measurements...|$|R

Whereas in 37 of 51 patients a normal or almost normal colloquial speech could be demonstrated, 30 of 39 patients with cleft lip and palate showed a normal or almost normal realization of the test sentences. Thirty of the 37 patients (81. 08 percent) with normal or almost normal colloquial speech showed extensive mobility of the lateral pharyngeal wall. Symmetry of the velopharyngeal flaps seemed to have no influence on the speech result.
