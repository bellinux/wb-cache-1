5|$|The player {{takes the}} roles of various defense attorneys, {{including}} Phoenix Wright, his mentor Mia Fey, and his understudies Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes, and investigates cases and defends their clients in court; they find the truth by cross-examining witnesses and finding inconsistencies between the testimonies and the evidence they have collected. The cases all last a maximum of three days, with the judge determining the outcome based on evidence presented by the defense attorney <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor.</b> In the spin-off series Ace Attorney Investigations, the player takes the role of prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, and in the spin-off , they play as Phoenix's ancestor Ryūnosuke Naruhodō.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 2009 the ICC Presidency {{assigned}} {{the situation in}} Kenya to Pre-Trial Chamber II <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor</b> made an application to that chamber for authorisation to open a formal investigation on 26 November. The judges of the pre-trial chamber granted this authorisation on 31 March 2010. The judges who made this decision, Ekaterina Trendafilova, Hans-Peter Kaul and Cuno Tarfusser noted in their written ruling that while Article 15 of the Rome Statute does allow for the Prosecutor to investigate and prosecute a case of his own volition, {{this is one of}} the more controversial aspects of the ICC. In the ICC's history, this case was the first time the Prosecutor decided to investigate a case in this manner, with all prior cases being referred to the Court either by a national government, or by the United Nations Security Council.|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{three kinds of}} {{unethical}} and unconstitutional practices and policies of prosecutors’ offices: (1) Cases in which a <b>prosecutor,</b> in <b>the</b> heat of a trial, unintentionally acts unethically or unconstitutionally, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor’s</b> office then makes that conduct official policy by adopting and seeking to justify the conduct on appeal; (2) Cases in which a “rogue” prosecutor purposefully engages in unethical and/or unconstitutional tactics, like concealing Brady material, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor’s</b> office seeks to justify the conduct on appeal; (3) Cases in which a chief prosecutor adopts unethical and/or unconstitutional practices as office policy. In addition, a related issue is discussed – the general failure of disciplinary authorities and courts to take disciplinary or other remedial measures against prosecutors who violate both the rights of criminal defendants <b>and</b> <b>the</b> prosecutors’ own ethical obligations...|$|R

5|$|While Parke's {{conviction}} cleared Euston, another {{trial began}} on 16 December 1889 when Newlove's and Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, {{was charged with}} obstruction of justice. It was alleged that he conspired to prevent Hammond and the boys from testifying by offering or giving them passage and money to go abroad. Newton was defended by Charles Russell, who had prosecuted Ernest Parke, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor</b> was Sir Richard Webster, the Attorney General. Newton pleaded guilty {{to one of the}} six charges against him, claiming that he had assisted Hammond to flee merely to protect his clients, who were not at that time charged with any offence or under arrest, from potential blackmail. The Attorney General accepted Newton's pleas and did not present any evidence on the other five charges. On 20 May, the judge, Sir Lewis Cave, sentenced Newton to six weeks in prison, which was widely considered by members of the legal profession to be harsh. A petition signed by 250 London law firms was sent to the Home Secretary, Henry Matthews, protesting at Newton's treatment.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{theories}} about the death of JonBenét. One is the intruder theory that was pursued by the Boulder District Attorney's office, with whom the Ramseys developed a relationship.

25|$|On 28 August 2008, Hervé Eon, from Laval {{came to an}} anti-Sarkozy {{demonstration}} with a sign {{bearing the}} words Casse-toi pov' con, the exact words Sarkozy had uttered. Eon was arrested for causing offence to the presidential function <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor,</b> who in France indirectly reports to the president, requested a fine of €1000. The court eventually imposed a symbolic €30 suspended fine, which has generally been interpreted as a defeat for the prosecution side. This incident was widely reported on, in particular as Sarkozy, {{as president of the}} Republic, is immune from prosecution, notably restricting Eon's rights to sue Sarkozy for defamation.|$|E
25|$|In this case, {{the judge}} {{dismissed}} several potential jurors for various causes. The defense peremptorily challenged nine potential jurors <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor,</b> Joe Gutmann, peremptorily challenged six, including all four black persons, and a jury composed only of white persons was selected. The defense counsel moved to discharge the whole jury {{on the ground}} that the prosecutor's removal of the black veniremen violated petitioner's rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to a jury drawn from a cross section of the community, and under the Fourteenth Amendment to equal protection of the laws. Without expressly ruling on petitioner's request for a hearing, the trial judge denied the motion, and the jury ultimately convicted the defendant.|$|E
25|$|Although Ceaușescu {{had been}} nominal {{head of state}} since 1967, he had merely been first among equals on the State Council, with his real power coming from his status as party leader. The new post, however, made him the nation's top {{decision-maker}} both in name and in fact. He was empowered to carry out those functions of the State Council that did not require plenums. He also appointed and dismissed {{the president of the}} Supreme Court <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor</b> general whenever the legislature was not in session. In practice, from 1974 onward Ceaușescu frequently ruled by decree. For all intents and purposes, Ceaușescu now held all governing power in the nation; virtually all party and state institutions were subordinated to his will.|$|E

50|$|Announcing the Completion Strategy of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in 2003 it {{was obvious}} that the Court of Bosnia <b>and</b> Herzegovina <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prosecutor’s</b> Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina should have a {{jurisdiction}} over the prosecution of war crimes and they should take over the war crime cases from the Hague Tribunal. Therefore, in 2004 a set of legal acts was drafted and it was adopted by the BiH Parliament in December 2004. In January 2005 the third department, the War Crimes Department, was established within <b>the</b> <b>Prosecutor’s</b> Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina which prosecutes war crime cases.|$|R
25|$|On July 25—seven {{days after}} the incident—Kennedy pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving {{the scene of an}} {{accident}} causing bodily injury.

25|$|Having {{been found}} guilty of {{corruption}} and impiety, Socrates <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor</b> suggested sentences for the punishment of his crimes against the city-state of Athens. Expressing surprise at the few votes required for an acquittal, Socrates joked that he be punished with free meals at the Prytaneum (the city’s sacred hearth), an honour usually held for a benefactor of Athens, and for the victorious athletes of an Olympiad. After that failed suggestion, Socrates then offered to pay a fine of 100 drachmae — one-fifth of his property — which largesse testified to his integrity and poverty as a philosopher. Finally, a fine of 3,000 drachmae was agreed, proposed by Plato, Crito, Critobulus, and Apollodorus, who guaranteed payment — nonetheless, the prosecutor of the trial of Socrates proposed {{the death penalty for}} the impious philosopher. (Diogenes Laertius, 2.42).|$|E
25|$|On August 7, 1970, Jonathan Jackson, {{a heavily}} armed, 17-year-old African-American high-school student, gained {{control over a}} {{courtroom}} in Marin County, California. Once in the courtroom, Jackson armed the black defendants and took Judge Harold Haley, the prosecutor, and three female jurors as hostages. As Jackson transported the hostages and two black convicts away from the courtroom, the police began shooting at the vehicle. The judge and the three black men {{were killed in the}} melee; one of the jurors <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor</b> were injured. Although the judge {{was shot in the head}} with a blast from the shotgun, he also suffered a chest wound from a bullet that may have been fired from outside the van. Evidence during the trial showed, however, that either could have been fatal. The firearms which Jackson used in the attack, including the shotgun used to kill Judge Haley, had been purchased by Davis two days prior, and the barrel of the shotgun had been sawn off. Davis was found to have been corresponding with one of the inmates involved.|$|E

500|$|Attempts {{to correct}} {{phosphorus}} {{levels in the}} Everglades met with resistance. The sugarcane industry, dominated by two companies named U.S. Sugar and Flo-Sun, was responsible {{for more than half}} of the crop in the EAA. They were well represented in state and federal governments by lobbyists who enthusiastically protected their interests. According to the Audubon Society, the sugar industry, nicknamed [...] "Big Sugar", donated more money to political parties and candidates than General Motors. The sugar industry attempted to block government-funded studies of polluted water, and when the federal prosecutor in Miami faulted the sugar industry in legal action to protect Everglades National Park, Big Sugar tried to get the lawsuit withdrawn <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor</b> fired. A costly legal battle ensued from 1988 to 1992 between the State of Florida, the U.S. government, and the sugar industry to resolve who was responsible for water quality standards, the maintenance of Everglades National Park and the Arthur R.

500|$|Phoenix's {{childhood}} friend Miles Edgeworth, {{who is the}} protagonist of the Ace Attorney Investigations games, is a recurring rival prosecutor character; in addition to him, each new game in the series introduces a new rival: Franziska von Karma is introduced in the second game, Godot in the third, Klavier Gavin in the fourth, Simon Blackquill in the fifth, and Nahyuta Sahdmadhi in the sixth. The prosecutor characters are portrayed as powerful and arrogant characters of high social status, who favor convictions over finding the truth, and who care about keeping perfect-win records in court. Similarly to real Japanese prosecutors, the prosecutors in the series often directly oversee investigations, issuing orders to the police. Japanese attitudes towards the police force {{are reflected in the}} series, with the police being represented by incompetent characters such as Dick Gumshoe, Maggey Byrde and Mike Meekins. In the world of Ace Attorney, trials only last three days, and usually end with a [...] "guilty" [...] verdict. The outcomes of cases are decided by a judge, based on evidence provided by the defense attorney <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor.</b>|$|E
500|$|During the {{courtroom}} sections, the player {{attempts to get}} the defendant declared innocent by questioning witnesses and presenting evidence to the judge <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecutor.</b> Many witnesses lie during their testimonies; the player is able to {{move back and forth}} through the testimony to try to find any inconsistencies. There are two options available during cross-examinations: [...] "press", which makes the player question a particular statement, which sometimes makes the witnesses change their testimony; and [...] "present", which is used to show a piece of evidence or a character profile that the player thinks shows a contradiction in the witness's currently shown statement. In the upper right corner of the screen, the player's health bar is shown, representing the judge's patience. The bar decreases if the player makes mistakes, such as presenting the wrong piece of evidence; if it reaches zero, the defendant is declared guilty, and the player loses the game. While the player cannot lose the game while trying to break a psyche-lock, the bar will still decrease if the player presents the wrong evidence while trying to break psyche-locks. 50% of the bar is restored when the player manages to break a psyche-lock, and 100% is restored when an episode is completed.|$|E
