5|$|A month later, an {{environmental}} {{study was conducted}} {{that focused on the}} possibilities of rerouting the proposed freeway. In April 1972, the majority of voters supported a referendum that halted plans to build the SR78 freeway through the city of Escondido. The city then turned its focus to widening Lincoln Avenue <b>and</b> <b>Ash</b> Street instead, and also requested that the routing of SR78 be moved to Broadway, Washington Avenue, <b>and</b> <b>Ash</b> Street from Grand Avenue to improve traffic flow. Five years later, signs were installed on eastbound SR78, directing traffic headed for the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to use I-15 south to Via Rancho Parkway instead of continuing eastbound, to bypass the Escondido traffic.|$|E

5|$|In a {{volcanic}} eruption, lava, tephra (volcanic bombs, lapilli, <b>and</b> <b>ash),</b> and various gases are expelled from {{a volcanic}} vent or fissure. While many eruptions only pose dangers to the immediately surrounding area, Earth's largest eruptions {{can have a}} major regional or even global impact, with some affecting the climate and contributing to mass extinctions. Volcanic eruptions can generally be characterized as either explosive eruptions, sudden ejections of rock <b>and</b> <b>ash,</b> or effusive eruptions, relatively gentle outpourings of lava. A separate list is given below for each type.|$|E

40|$|This {{publication}} {{presents the}} engineering properties of Kuantan clay and proposes {{an assessment of}} the utilization of fly <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> bottom <b>ash</b> as stabilizer of soft sugbrades material in highway construction. The research conducts various contents of fly <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> bottom <b>ash</b> to different types of clay soils from various sites in Kuantan. The compaction tests and California Bearing Ratio (CBR) tests were applied in soil samples to estimate the optimum mixture design. The samples were set up by mixing soil samples with various contents of fly <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> bottom <b>ash</b> at optimum water content. The accomplishment of subgrade stabilization depends on the engineering properties of soils and characteristic of fly <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> bottom <b>ash.</b> The laboratory result shows that the strength gain in stabilization mainly depends on two factors: fly <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> bottom <b>ash</b> content <b>and</b> molding water content. The variation content of fly <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> bottom <b>ash</b> were 4 %, 8 % and 12 % by total weight...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} the utilization of fly <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> bottom <b>ash</b> to improve the sugbrades material in highway construction. The research conducts various contents of fly <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> bottom <b>ash</b> to different types of clay soils from various sites in Kuantan. The compaction tests and California Bearing Ratio (CBR) tests were applied in soil samples to estimate the optimum mixture design. The samples were set up by mixing soil samples with various content of fly <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> bottom <b>ash</b> at different water content in compaction test to obtain optimum dry unit weight and optimum water contents. This optimum water contents were used in CBR tests of mixtures of soil samples-fly ash/bottom ash. The accomplishment of subgrade stabilization depends on the engineering properties of soils and characteristic of fly <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> bottom <b>ash.</b> The performance analysis of ﬂy <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> bottom <b>ash</b> should be based on the laboratory tests such as engineering properties of soil, compaction and CBR tests of a speciﬁc site in Kuantan.

5|$|After {{an initial}} {{explosive}} eruption, extrusion of gas-depleted dacite magma commonly forms lava domes. Growing lava domes are inherently unstable, and collapse of their steep sides often generates pyroclastic flows of lava blocks <b>and</b> <b>ash</b> that can travel several miles.

5|$|Ash soon {{comes to}} realize that the Pikachu refuses to go inside his Poké Ball and prefers his independence. As Ash carries the {{reluctant}} Pikachu, he hopes that they can be friends, but Pikachu acts aloof and openly shows his distrust of Ash. Just then, the two stumble upon a Pidgey in the wild <b>and</b> <b>Ash</b> unsuccessfully tries to catch it by throwing a Poké Ball. Ash uses his Pokédex and finds out that in order to catch a Pokémon, a trainer must first use their Pokémon to battle it, thereby weakening it, to be caught by a Poké Ball. With Pikachu being uncooperative, Ash tries to fight the Pidgey himself, but is easily beaten, which greatly amuses Pikachu. The Pidgey escapes <b>and</b> <b>Ash</b> finds a Rattata rummaging through his pack. He chases the Pokémon off as he hears cooing behind him. He turns to see several Pidgey gathered in the tall grass. Frustrated, Ash throws a rock at what he believes is the Pidgey. However, {{it turns out to be}} a Spearow, which starts attacking Pikachu <b>and</b> <b>Ash.</b> Pikachu shocks Spearow, and in the process alerts a whole flock. The angered Spearow flock gives chase and eventually catches up and attacks Pikachu. Ash quickly grabs Pikachu and dives down a waterfall in order to escape from the flock of Spearow, and the two are fished out down river by a young girl named Misty, who tells Ash to take the injured Pikachu to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City. Seeing the Spearow flock approaching, Ash escapes with Pikachu taking Misty's bike.|$|E

As the Cascades rose, the Rogue maintained its flow to the ocean by down-cutting, which created steep narrow gorges and rapids in many places.

The Ape Canyon eruptive period ended around 35,000 years ago and was followed by 17,000 years of relative quiet. Parts of this ancestral cone were fragmented and transported by glaciers 14,000 to 18,000 years ago during the last glacial period of the current ice age.|$|E
