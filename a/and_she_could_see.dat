500|$|According to the {{classical}} Quranic exegete, Ibn Kathir, after Ezra questioned how the resurrection will {{take place on the}} Day of judgment, God had him brought back to life many years after he died. He rode on his revived donkey and entered his native place. But the people did not recognize him, nor did his household, except the maid, who was now an old blind woman. He prayed to God to cure her blindness <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> again. He meets his son who recognized him by a mole between his shoulders and was older than he was. Ezra then led the people to locate the only surviving copy of Torah as the remaining were burnt by Nebuchadnezzar. It was rotting and crumpled, so Ezra had a new copy of the Torah made which he had previously memorised. He thus renovated the Torah to the Children of Israel. Ibn Kathir mentions that the sign in the phrase [...] "And that We may make of thee a sign unto the people" [...] was that he was younger than his children. After this miracle, Ibn Kathir writes that Jews began to claim that Ezra was the 'son of God'.|$|E
60|$|Adrea was {{the first}} to recover her composure. She was a little further away, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> only her step-mother.|$|E
60|$|Billy's face {{abruptly}} stiffened, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{his eyes}} cloudy with doubt in the quick glance he flung at her.|$|E
60|$|Joan {{calculated}} {{she must}} have seen a thousand miners {{in less than two}} miles of the gulch, <b>and</b> then <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> up the draws and washes that intersected the slope, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> beyond the camp.|$|R
60|$|It {{was growing}} dark, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>see</b> his face. He hesitated, {{but he did}} not attempt to evade the question.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her on this with {{conscious}} inconsistency, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> now <b>see</b> that he had changed colour. But he was always easy.|$|R
60|$|Vane {{laughed and}} {{stretched}} out one of his hands. It was lean and brown, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the marks of old scars on the knuckles.|$|E
6000|$|He turned quickly round, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> this {{movement}} at least was not designed. He {{looked at her}} a little, and then, [...] "Are {{you out of your}} mind?" [...] he enquired.|$|E
60|$|Day {{after day}} they met--somewhat less {{constantly}} than before; and thus {{two or three}} weeks went by. The end of September drew near, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> in his eye that he might ask her again.|$|E
60|$|Through {{the open}} door between her room <b>and</b> Frances's <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that the latter's bed was empty. Then she saw a little note, {{addressed}} to her, pinned on the pillow.|$|R
60|$|The {{door was}} ajar, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> {{anything}} within. She pushed it open tentatively: {{there was no}} sound: Frank was evidently not there, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> walked boldly in.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll all go," [...] cried Di, {{catching}} {{fire at the}} flame of Walter's fancy, <b>and</b> half-believing <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the mocking, retreating figure of the mystic piper in the far, dim end of the valley.|$|R
60|$|We {{stood looking}} at one another {{on the edge of}} the marsh. In the clear morning {{sunlight}} I had no chance of escape or subterfuge. There was terror in my face, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it.|$|E
60|$|Her {{friends were}} looking with round {{thoughtful}} eyes {{at her and}} him, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that they had been}} talking of her. He hastily bade them farewell, and splashed back along the stretch of submerged road.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I've {{taken the}} cool {{all out of}} that spot." [...] He {{did not look up}} to her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the roguish smile that curled on his lips. [...] "So I guess I'll try another." ...|$|E
6000|$|And I, still lying, {{showed her}} the pretended fatal words on the pretended fatal page, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> gazed at them through her tears, <b>and</b> said <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> herself that they were hateful, ugly words--they [...] "had the very look of it." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Miss Mackenzie {{went to her}} desk, {{and brought}} him {{a copy of the}} note she had written to the lawyer. He read it very carefully, twice over; <b>and</b> then <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> when he refolded the paper, that his eyes were {{glittering}} with satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|Florence {{looked at}} her with {{increasing}} fear <b>and</b> wonder, until <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her no more through the blinding tears that ran down her face.|$|R
60|$|After {{what seemed}} a {{thousand}} weary hours some one lifted her from the horse and laid her upon the ground, where, gradually, as the blood left her head <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> she began {{to get the right}} relation of things.|$|E
60|$|PROF. D. Suppose {{you were}} to bring her to town for a few days. We should be delighted to have you, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the doctor to whom she is accustomed. Then you can judge for {{yourself}} about her daughter.|$|E
60|$|It lasted {{through the}} day, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that he was}} troubled. It had not {{followed}} upon any imprudeuce, as Mrs. Lander pathetically called Clementina to witness when her pain had been so far quelled that she could talk of her seizure.|$|E
60|$|Honora was silent. He {{had thrown}} away his cigar, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> no longer <b>see</b> his face. She {{wondered}} whither he was leading.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Kenton sat in {{the corner}} of the sofa next the door, looking into the girl's face on the pillow as she lay with her arms under her head. Tears of defeat and shame came into her eyes, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> the girl's light nonchalance in adding: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{just about}} the right size," [...] said the Mayor, looking them over with much pleasure, and when the girl turned around she found Mr. Bowko and Mrs. Puff-Pudgy {{standing}} beside her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>see</b> that Chubbins was no bigger than they, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> was no bigger than Chubbins.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you mean?" [...] she asked, {{suddenly}} cold {{with the}} first sensations of fear. The man's quietness was ominous, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> his face now. He put his handkerchief away {{and came over to}} her, catching her wrists with a sudden catlike movement.|$|E
60|$|The {{returned}} traveller {{entered the}} house, {{where he found}} awaiting him poor old Mrs. Martin, to whose earthly course death stood rather as the asymptote than as the end. She was perceptibly smaller in form than when he had left her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> less distinctly.|$|E
60|$|A {{mile from}} Gopher Prairie the track mounts a curving low ridge, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the town as a whole. With a passionate jerk she pushed up the window, looked out, the arched fingers {{of her left}} hand {{trembling}} on the sill, her right hand at her breast.|$|E
60|$|Mara {{was staring}} up at the wall and the towers beyond. Under their feet the ground trembled, {{vibrating}} <b>and</b> shaking. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> tongues of flame rising from the towers, from the deep underground factories and forges of the City. The air was thick and dense with particles of soot. Mara rubbed her mouth, coughing.|$|R
6000|$|He met {{her eyes}} <b>and</b> then <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that his own}} were really much graver than his manner. [...] "Gone?" [...] She had flown to the door, but before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> raise her hand to knock he was beside her and had caught it. [...] "Let her be. I don't care about her. I want to see YOU." ...|$|R
60|$|Lily {{was looking}} out, and {{listening}} to the gophers whistling as they raced to <b>and</b> fro. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Bob Burns lying at length on the grass in the pasture over the fence, his heels waving in the air, his hands holding a string which formed a snare. It was like fishing to young Izaak Walton.|$|R
60|$|Estella {{leaned against}} the gate, {{listening}} {{for the sound of}} wheels and dreamily watching the light shining out from the window of Vivienne LeMar's room. The blind was up <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Miss LeMar writing at her table. Her profile was clear and distinct against the lamplight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sam has come, then?" [...] said he; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that there}} was a sparkle of joy in his eye as he spoke. Oh, if she could only make the return of that other child as {{grateful}} to him as would have been the return of his son! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Young woman;--with blue frock! {{who told}} you of the young woman, Linda?" [...] He came and knelt beside her as he asked the question, leaving his watch for the moment; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> by {{the dim light of}} the lamp outside that there was a smile upon his face,--almost joyous, full of mirth.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> {{knelt down}} <b>and</b> {{crept into the}} hole, while after her came Robert, and after him the two Zulus, who protested {{that they were not}} ant-bears to burrow under ground. Lifting the lantern she searched the cave, <b>and</b> as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> no signs of the crocodile, walked on boldly to where the stair began.|$|R
60|$|Thus it {{was that}} when, in {{the evening of the}} same day, Mrs. Manston reached Carriford Road Station, her husband was still at Chettlewood, ignorant of her arrival, and on looking up and down the platform, dreary with autumn gloom <b>and</b> wind, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> no sign that any {{preparation}} whatever had been made for her reception and conduct home.|$|R
60|$|Even then Jeanne was reluctant. They {{were on the}} top of the grass-grown dyke now, <b>and</b> below <b>she</b> <b>could</b> dimly <b>see</b> the dark, {{swelling}} water lapping {{against the}} gravel bottom.|$|R
