5|$|He {{drew from}} his medical {{training}} to discredit popular ideas about {{differences among the}} races. In 1843 he gave a lecture series, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Races, to demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so-called scientific practice {{of the time that}} was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. He rejected the practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Association</b> or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Obesity is {{a leading}} {{preventable}} cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2015, 600 million adults (12%) and 100 million children were obese. Obesity {{is more common in}} women than men. Authorities view it {{as one of the most}} serious public health problems of the 21stcentury. Obesity is stigmatized in much of the modern world (particularly in the Western world), though it was seen as a symbol of wealth and fertility at other times in history and still is in some parts of the world. In 2013, the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Association</b> classified obesity as a disease.|$|E

5|$|Parsons {{would become}} the first inmate to be {{executed}} in a new chamber that was built in 1998 at Utah State Prison for use in either firing squads or lethal injections. Two people, whose identities were withheld, were selected to administer individual injections, of which only one was lethal so that neither would know with certainty who executed the prisoner. The prison selected among paramedics or nurses because the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Association</b> prohibits licensed physicians from participating in executions. A mild sedative was delivered intravenously to calm Parsons before the deadly drugs were administered.|$|E
5|$|A {{position}} paper {{published by the}} American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2007 warns {{that there is no}} valid medical reason to perform the procedure, which is not considered routine or accepted by the College; and it has not been proven to be safe or effective. The potential risks include sexual dysfunction, infection, altered sensation, dyspareunia, adhesions and scarring. The College position is that it is untenable to recommend the procedure. The procedure is also not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Association,</b> and no peer-reviewed studies have been accepted to account for either safety or effectiveness of this treatment.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{licensed}} to practise {{medicine in the}} United States, he began testing the boxes on human beings diagnosed with cancer and schizophrenia. In one case the test had to be stopped prematurely because the subject heard a rumour that Reich was insane; there were stories, which were false, {{that he had been}} hospitalized in the Utica State Mental Hospital. In another case the father of an eight-year-old girl with cancer approached him for help, then complained to the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Association</b> that he was practising without a licence. He asked his supporters to stick with him through the criticism, believing that he had developed a grand unified theory of physical and mental health.|$|E

5|$|By the 1940s it was {{recognized}} that this arrangement was unsatisfactory. The <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Association</b> conducted {{a series of}} studies in 1948, followed by a Department of the Interior study in 1950. They highlighted the deficiencies of the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, and the long trip to Portland had a negative effect on patients and their families. In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).|$|E
5|$|Having {{finished}} her studies, Morton {{returned to the}} United States in 1902 and opened a medical practice specialising in gynecology in Washington D.C. After marrying George Morton Jr., she opened a new medical practice in New York, where he was an attorney. In 1909 the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Association</b> created a Public Health Education Committee {{with the aim of}} educating the public on subjects including health, hygiene, child care, and other medical topics; they made Morton its first chairperson. Morton was appointed as a clinical assistant and instructor at the Polyclinic Hospital of New York (where {{she was one of the}} first female faculty members), and later became a professor of gynecology. During this time she lectured at a number of other universities including a summer at the University of Vermont.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Association</b> (AMA) {{approved}} a measure allowing qualified osteopathic physicians as full and active {{members of the}} Association. The measure also allowed osteopathic physicians to participate in AMA-approved intern and residency programs. However, the American Osteopathic Association rejected this measure, claiming it {{was an attempt to}} eliminate the distinctiveness of osteopathic medicine. In 1970, AMA President Dwight L. Wilbur, M.D. sponsored a measure in the AMA's House of Delegates permitting the AMA Board of Trustees' plan for the merger of D.O. and M.D. professions. Today, a majority of osteopathic physicians are trained alongside MDs, in residency programs governed by the ACGME, an independent board of the AMA.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to practicing {{as a doctor}} for nearly 20 years at the Colored Orphan Asylum in Manhattan, Smith was a public intellectual: he contributed articles to medical journals, participated in learned societies, and wrote numerous essays and articles drawing from his medical and statistical training. He used his training in medicine and statistics to refute common misconceptions about race, intelligence, medicine, and society in general. Invited as {{a founding member of}} the New York Statistics Society in 1852, which promoted a new science, he was elected as a member in 1854 of the recently founded American Geographic Society. But he was never admitted to the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Association</b> or local medical associations.|$|E
5|$|Legal {{victories}} in the 1930s continued to weaken anti-contraception laws. The court victories motivated the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Association</b> in 1937 to adopt contraception as a core component of medical school curricula, but the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources. In 1942, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America was formed, creating a nationwide network of birth control clinics. After World War II, the movement to legalize birth control came to a gradual conclusion, as birth control was fully embraced by the medical profession, and the remaining anti-contraception laws were no longer enforced.|$|E
5|$|On November 8, 2004, Fletcher {{signed a}} death warrant for Thomas Clyde Bowling, {{who was convicted}} of a double murder in 1990 and sentenced to death by lethal injection. A group of doctors {{requested}} an investigation by the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure to determine whether Fletcher's medical license should be revoked for that action. Kentucky requires doctors to follow the guidelines of the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Association,</b> which forbid doctors from participating in an execution. On January 13, 2005, the Board of Medical Licensure found that Fletcher was acting in his capacity as governor, not as a doctor, when he signed the warrant and ruled that his license was not subject to forfeiture by that action.|$|E
