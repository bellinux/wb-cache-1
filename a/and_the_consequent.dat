5|$|From {{this point}} Fort Glanville's {{significance}} declined rapidly. Fort Largs was equipped in 1889 with two 6inch breech-loading disappearing guns which outranged Glanville's armament. The decline was also linked {{to changes in}} Port Adelaide's maritime facilities <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequent</b> northward movement of anchored and berthed vessels. During the 1880s the Port River was deepened enabling large ships to sail up and berth, rather than the former practice of anchoring off-shore.|$|E
5|$|In 1941 the Soviet Union {{decided to}} cease {{production}} of the 152 mm howitzer M1938 (M-10). One of the reasons was the disbanding of the Rifle Corps between August and September 1941 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequent</b> removal of the corps artillery. Moreover, all 152mm howitzers were excluded from divisional artillery. As a result, there was no series production of 152mm howitzers during 1942.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{sketch a}} logic-based {{framework}} in which computation consists of performing actions to generate a sequence of states, {{with the purpose of}} making a set of reactive rules in the logical form antecedents � <b>consequents</b> all true. <b>The</b> antecedents of the rules are conjunctions of past or present conditions <b>and</b> events, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequents</b> of <b>the</b> rules are disjunctions of conjunctions of future conditions <b>and</b> actions. <b>The</b> antecedents can be viewed as complex/composite events, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequents</b> as complex/composite/macro actions or processes. States are represented by sets of atomic sentences, and can be viewed as global variables, relational databases, Herbrand models, or mental representations of the real world. Events, including actions, transform one state into another. The operational semantics maintains only a single, destructively updated current state, whereas the model-theoretic semantics treats the entire sequence of states, events and actions as a single model. The model-theoretic semantics can be viewed as the problem of generating a model that makes all the reactive rules true...|$|R

5|$|Nonetheless, Alexander Twining and James Harrison set up ice {{plants in}} Ohio and Melbourne {{respectively}} during the 1850s, both using Perkins engines.

Australia's distance from New England, where journeys could take 115 days, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequent</b> high level of wastage– 150 tons of the first 400-ton shipment to Sydney melted on route– made it relatively easy for plant ice {{to compete with the}} natural product.

5|$|Territorial {{males are}} very site-faithful; 90% {{return to the}} same lekking sites in {{subsequent}} seasons, the most dominant males being {{the most likely to}} reappear. Site-faithful males can acquire accurate information about the competitive abilities of other males, leading to well-developed dominance relationships. Such stable relationships reduce conflict and the risk of injury, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequent</b> lower levels of male aggression are less likely to scare off females. Lower-ranked territorial males also benefit from site fidelity since they can remain on the leks while waiting for the top males eventually to drop out.|$|E

30|$|Here, we {{introduce}} {{concepts of}} <b>the</b> uncertain inference <b>and</b> uncertain system. Inference rules {{are the key}} points of the inference systems. In fuzzy systems, CRI approach [22], Mamdani inference rules [23] and Takagi-Sugeno inference rules [24] {{are the most common}} used inference rules. Fuzzy if-then inference rules use fuzzy sets to describe <b>the</b> antecedents <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequents.</b> Unlike fuzzy inference, both antecedents and consequents in uncertain inference are characterized by uncertain sets. Uncertain inference [16] is a process of deriving consequences from human knowledge via uncertain set theory. First, we introduce the following inference rule.|$|R

5|$|Although {{not a true}} coral, Millepora alcicornis {{is subject}} to the same general threats that corals and coral reefs are facing. The {{greatest}} of these is global warming <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequent</b> rise in sea temperatures.

However, it is also more resilient than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the French Republic {{in the early spring}} of 1793, the French Revolutionary Wars were already a year old. The French Navy was already suffering from the upheavals of the French Revolution <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequent</b> dissolution of the professional officer class, while the Royal Navy had been at a state of readiness since the summer of 1792. During the early months of the war the French Navy focused heavily on raiding and disrupting British commerce and deployed frigates on raiding operations against British commercial shipping. In the English Channel, two of the most successful raiders were the frigates Réunion and Sémillante, based in Cherbourg on the Cotentin Peninsula. These frigates would make short cruises, leaving Cherbourg in the early evening and returning in the morning with any prizes they had encountered during the night.|$|E
5|$|During a {{game against}} the Canucks on March 8, 2004, Canucks player Todd Bertuzzi punched Colorado's Steve Moore from behind, leaving Moore unconscious. It was said to be {{retaliation}} for a hit Moore had delivered to Canucks captain Markus Naslund the month before. Because of the punch <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequent</b> fall on the ice with Bertuzzi on top of him, and numerous other players from both teams piling on top, Moore sustained three fractured neck vertebrae, among other injuries, that ended his career. Bertuzzi was away from professional hockey for 17 months as a result of suspensions. In Denver, ever since the Moore hit, it has become tradition for the home fans to boo Todd Bertuzzi every time he gains possession of the puck, whenever his team faces the Avalanche at Pepsi Center.|$|E
5|$|During {{the era of}} the {{collodion}} process, {{before the}} arrival of less demanding photographic technology (the gelatin silver process, photographic film, and smaller cameras) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequent</b> rise of amateur photography, commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views. In Japan before 1899 such photographers were even more significant because the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior, and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas. By 1889, however, Farsari estimated that about half of all visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers; even if this was an exaggeration, the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously affecting the commercial photography business. To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise, Farsari provided free use of a darkroom.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{suppression}} of the Russian Revolution of 1905 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequent</b> exile of political dissidents from the Russian Empire, Russian-language journalism in New York City enjoyed a revival. Among the fledgling publications were a number of political newspapers and labor union periodicals, including Golos Truda, which the Union of Russian Workers in the United States and Canada began publishing in the city in 1911, initially on a monthly basis. The newspaper adopted the ideology of anarcho-syndicalism, a fusion of trade unionism and anarchist philosophy which had emerged from the 1907 International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam and along similar lines in America through the influential Industrial Workers of the World. The anarcho-syndicalists rejected state-oriented political struggle and intellectualism, instead proposing labor unions as the revolutionary agents that would bring about an anarchist society characterised primarily by worker collectives.|$|E

In late 1977, three Boeing 707s were acquired from Northwest Orient. The following year, the company formed a charter subsidiary named Kenya Flamingo Airlines, which leased aircraft from the parent airline in order to operate international passenger and cargo services. Aer Lingus provided the company with technical and management support in the early years.|$|E
