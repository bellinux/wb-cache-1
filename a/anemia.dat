5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a hemolytic <b>anemia</b> (<b>anemia</b> due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E
5|$|Blood film {{examination}} {{may reveal}} basophilic stippling of {{red blood cells}} (dots in red blood cells visible through a microscope), {{as well as the}} changes normally associated with iron-deficiency <b>anemia</b> (microcytosis and hypochromasia). However, basophilic stippling is also seen in unrelated conditions, such as megaloblastic <b>anemia</b> caused by vitamin B12 (colbalamin) and folate deficiencies.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his study}} in Puerto Rico, in 1933 Rhoads {{was chosen to}} lead a special service at the Rockefeller Institute in {{clinical}} hematology, to study diseases of the blood-forming organs. He built on his research on <b>anemia</b> and tropical sprue. In 1934 Rhoads and another researcher published results of the success in using liver extract therapy to treat tropical sprue (and relieve <b>anemia).</b> Their work was recognized as contributing benefit in treatment of the disease by others in the field.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} {{digestive}} tract lesions, mild bleeding and mild resultant <b>anemia</b> is treated with iron supplementation, and no specific treatment is administered. There is limited data on hormone treatment and tranexamic acid to reduce bleeding and <b>anemia.</b> Severe <b>anemia</b> or episodes of severe bleeding {{are treated with}} endoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC) or laser treatment of any lesions identified; this may {{reduce the need for}} supportive treatment. The expected benefits are not such that repeated attempts at treating lesions are advocated. Sudden, very severe bleeding is unusual—if encountered, alternative causes (such as a peptic ulcer) need to be considered—but embolization may be used in such instances.|$|E

Other strictures may include esophageal webs (which can also be congenital) and damage to the esophagus by radiotherapy, corrosive ingestion, or eosinophilic esophagitis. A Schatzki ring is fibrosis at the gastro-esophageal junction. Strictures may also develop in chronic <b>anemia,</b> and Plummer-Vinson syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common nutritional deficiency in the world. When loss of iron is not adequately compensated by adequate dietary iron intake, a state of latent iron deficiency occurs, which over time leads to iron-deficiency <b>anemia</b> if left untreated, which is characterised by an insufficient number of red blood cells and an insufficient amount of hemoglobin. Children, pre-menopausal women (women of child-bearing age), and people with poor diet are most susceptible to the disease. Most cases of iron-deficiency <b>anemia</b> are mild, but if not treated can cause problems like fast or irregular heartbeat, complications during pregnancy, and delayed growth in infants and children.|$|E
50|$|Especially common {{causes of}} macrocytic <b>anemias</b> are the {{so-called}} megaloblastic <b>anemias,</b> in which cells are larger because they cannot produce DNA {{quickly enough to}} divide {{at the right time}} as they grow and thus grow too large before division. Causes of the DNA synthetic problem range from lack of certain vitamins needed to produce DNA (notably folate and B12), to poisons or inhibitors of DNA replication, such as some kinds of antiviral drugs and chemotherapeutic agents. Classically, these megaloblastic types of <b>anemias</b> are associated also with more specific features, such as megaloblasts in the bone marrow, the presence of ovalocytes in the (peripheral) blood smear, and the pathognomonic presence of hypersegmented neutrophils.|$|R

5|$|Pain {{typically}} {{occurs when}} the stomach is empty, between meals {{and in the early}} morning hours, but it can also occur at other times. Less common ulcer symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Bleeding can also occur; prolonged bleeding may cause <b>anemia</b> leading to weakness and fatigue. If bleeding is heavy, hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena may occur.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of HHT is {{symptomatic}} (it {{deals with}} the symptoms rather than the disease itself), {{as there is no}} therapy that stops the development of telangiectasias and AVMs directly. Furthermore, some treatments are applied to prevent the development of common complications. Chronic nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding can both lead to anemia; if the bleeding itself cannot be completely stopped, the <b>anemia</b> requires treatment with iron supplements. Those who cannot tolerate iron tablets or solutions may require administration of intravenous iron, and blood transfusion if the <b>anemia</b> is causing severe symptoms that warrant rapid improvement of the blood count.|$|E

40|$|Hereditary {{hemolytic}} <b>anemias</b> are a {{group of}} disorders including red cell membrane defects, red blood cells enzyme disorders, congenital dyserythropoietic <b>anemias,</b> thalassemia syndromes and haemoglobinopathies. As damaged red blood cells passing through the spleen red pulp are efficiently removed by splenic macrophages, splenectomy is one possible therapeutic approach to the management of severely affected patients. However, except for hereditary spherocytosis for which the effectiveness of splenectomy has been well documented, the efficacy of splenectomy in other <b>anemias</b> within this group {{has yet to be}} determined and there are concerns regarding short- and long-term infectious and thrombotic complications. In light of the priorities identified by the European Hematology Association (EHA) Roadmap we generated specific recommendations for each disorder that will enable clinicians to achieve better informed decisions on disease management by splenectomy, on the type of splenectomy and possible consequences. Guidelines for thalassemia syndromes that have been previously established were excluded from the current work. As no randomized clinical trials, case control or cohort studies regarding splenectomy in those disorders were found in the literature, recommendations for each disease were based on expert opinion, which were subsequently critically revised and modified by the Splenectomy in Rare <b>Anemias</b> Study Group including both adult and pediatric hematologists...|$|R
5|$|While {{working for}} the Rockefeller Institute, in 1931 Rhoads was invited by {{hematologist}} William B. Castle to join his Rockefeller <b>Anemia</b> Commission, to conduct clinical research at Presbyterian Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This {{was part of the}} Rockefeller Foundation's sanitary commission on the island through the International Health Division. Castle's research interest was pernicious iron deficiency <b>anemia,</b> specifically as caused by the parasitic hookworm, which was endemic on the island at rates of 80%, and tropical sprue. An effective treatment for the latter had just been developed, although the disease's causes remained obscure. As recently as 2010, medical journal Nieto Editores reported that these conditions continued to cause high mortality in Puerto Ricans. The cause of tropical sprue has still not been identified, but since the 1940s, it can be treated with folic acid and a 3 to 6-month course of antibiotics.|$|E

5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic <b>anemia</b> are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E
40|$|Iron {{overload}} is {{a potentially}} life-threatening consequence of multiple red-blood-cell transfusions. Here, we review factors affecting excess iron distribution and its damage to specific tissues, {{as well as}} mechanisms of oncogenesis by iron. Although consequences of transfusional iron overload are best described in thalassemia major and related inherited <b>anemias,</b> they are increasingly recognized in acquired conditions, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Iron overload in MDS not only impacts on certain tissues, but may affect the clonal evolution of MDS through generation of reactive oxygen species. Iron overload may also influence hematopoietic-stem-cell-transplantation outcomes. Novel MRI methods for assessing body iron have impacted significantly on outcome in inherited <b>anemias</b> by allowing monitoring of iron burden and iron chelation therapy. This approach is increasingly being used in MDS and stem-cell-transplant procedures. Knowledge gained from managing transfusional iron overload in inherited <b>anemias</b> may be translated to general oncology, with potential for improved patient outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Transfusion {{therapy for}} {{inherited}} <b>anemias</b> and acquired refractory <b>anemias</b> both improves {{the quality of}} life and prolongs survival. A conse-quence of chronic transfusion therapy is secondary iron overload, which adversely affects the function of the heart, the liver and other organs. This ses-sion will review the use of iron chelating agents in the management of transfusion-induced secondary iron overload. In Section I Dr. John Porter describes tech-niques for the administration of deferoxamine that exploit the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug and minimize potential toxic side effects. The experience with chelation therapy in patients with thalassemia and sickle cell disease will be reviewed and guidelines will be suggested for chelation therapy of chronically transfused adults with refractory <b>anemias.</b> In Section II Dr. Nancy Olivieri examines the clinical consequences of transfusion-induced secondary iron overload and suggests criteria useful in determining the optimal timing of the initiation of chelation therapy. Finally, Dr. Olivieri discusses the clinical trials evaluating orally administered iron chelators...|$|R
