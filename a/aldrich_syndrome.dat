There are {{three types of}} stem cells categories by the ability to form after cells and correlated with the body’s development process. Totipotent: these stem cells can form an entire organism such as fertilized egg. Ploripotent: ploripotent cells are those that can form any cell in the body but cannot form an entire organism such as developing embryo’s totipotent cells become ploripotent  Multipotent: Multi potent stem cells are those that can only form specific cells in the body such as blood cells based. Based on the sources of stem cells we have three types of these cells: Autologous: Sources of the patient own cells are (Autologous) either the cells from patient own body or his or her cord blood. For this type of transplant the physician now usually collects the periphery rather than morrow because the procedure is easier on like a bane morrow harvest it take place outside of an operating room, and the patient does not to be under general unsetting. Allogenic: Sources of stem cells from another donore are primarily relatives (familial allogenic) or completely unrelated donors. Xenogenic: In these stem cells from different species are transplanted e. g striatal porcine fetal mesan cephalic (FVM) xenotransplants for Parkinson’s disease. On sites of isolation such as embryo, umbilical cord and other body tissues stem cells are named embnyonic, cord blood, and adult stem cells. The scope of results and clinical application of stem cells are such as: Neurodegenerative conditions (MS,ALS, Parkinson’s, Stroke), Ocular disorders- Glaucoma, retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), Auto Immune Conditions (Lupus, MS,R. arthritis, Diabetes, etc), Viral Conditions (Hepatitis C and AIDS), Heart Disease, Adrenal Disorders, Injury(Nerve, Brain, etc), Anti aging (hair, skin, weight control, overall well being/preventive), Emotional disorders, Organ / Tissue Cancers, Blood cancers, Blood diseases (Wiscott <b>Aldrich’s,</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> etc), We know that one cell produce all cells.

40|$|Induction of T cell antigen {{receptor}} (TCR) endocytosis {{has a significant}} impact on TCR signaling and T cell behavior, but the molecular interactions coordinating internalization of the activated TCR are poorly understood. Previously we have shown that TCR endocytosis is regulated by the Wiskott <b>Aldrich</b> <b>Syndrome</b> protein (WASp), a cytosolic effector which, upon interaction with the cdc 42 Rho GTPase, couples TCR engagement to Arp 2 / 3 complexmediated actin polymerization. Here we report that WASp associates in T cells with intersectin 2, an endocytic adaptor containing multiple domains including a Dbl homology (DH) domain with the potential to activate Rho GTPases. Intersectin 2 association with WASp increases after TCR engagement, and its overexpression in Cos- 7 cells induces WASp translocation to endocytic vesicles within which intersectin 2 colocalizes with both WASp and cdc 42. Intersectin 2, but not a DH domain-deleted (�DH) form of intersectin 2, and stimulation via the TCR also trigger the activation of cdc 42. Induction of TCR internalization is also augmented by intersectin 2 and severely impaired by latrunculin B treatment. Thus, intersection 2 appears to function cooperatively with WASp and cdc 42 to link the clathrin endocytic machinery to WASp-mediated actin polymerization and ultimately to occupancy-induced TCR endocytosis.

40|$|AbstractThe actin {{cytoskeleton}} plays {{a central}} role in many cell biological processes. The structure and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are regulated by numerous actin-binding proteins that usually contain one of the few known actin-binding motifs. WH 2 domain (WASP homology domain- 2) is a ∼ 35 residue actin monomer-binding motif, that is found in many different regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, including the β-thymosins, ciboulot, WASP (Wiskott <b>Aldrich</b> <b>syndrome</b> protein), verprolin/WIP (WASP-interacting protein), Srv 2 /CAP (adenylyl cyclase-associated protein) and several uncharacterized proteins. The most highly conserved residues in the WH 2 domain are important in β-thymosin’s interactions with actin monomers, suggesting that all WH 2 domains may interact with actin monomers through similar interfaces. Our sequence database searches did not reveal any WH 2 domain-containing proteins in plants.

40|$|Breast Cancer {{continues}} to be {{the most common form of}} cancer in women. The ability of tumour cells to spread from primary and metastatic tumours is the primary cause of death in patients with cancer. Thus, it rightly follows that significant research is dedicated to the pathways and mechanisms controlling metastases in order to guide therapeutic approaches. Wiskott <b>Aldrich</b> <b>Syndrome</b> [WAS] is an X-linked recessive condition with immunodeficiency as the clinical manifestation. It is caused by mutations of the Wiskott <b>Aldrich</b> <b>Syndrome</b> [WAS] gene, which codes for a cytoplasmic protein with multiple functions. Two major complexes that are linked to the NWASP family, namely the ERM family and Rho GTPases are aberrantly expressed in human breast cancer. Additionally, X chromosome inactivation which silences gene expression from one of the two X chromosomes in females, is usually random. Skewed X inactivation has been shown to occur more frequently in breast and ovarian cancer patients. Individuals with WAS are known to have skewed X inactivation. In addition, they are more susceptible to certain forms of malignancy, primarily haematological. This formed the basis of the present study, which sought to elucidate the role of WAS protein in human breast cancer, and to determine if it plays a role as a tumour suppressor. We also attempted to determine its biological role and association with clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer. We examined the correlation of NWASP with human breast cancer in vitro, in vivo and in human breast cancer tissue. Immunohistochemistry studies of frozen sectioned human breast cancer tissues revealed that breast cells stained positively for NWASP and that cancer cells in tumour tissues stained very weakly. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that breast cancer tissues had significantly lower levels of NWASP compared to normal background breast tissue. Although no significant correlation was found with tumour grade and TNM staging, lower levels of transcript were seen to correlate with clinical outcome following a 10 year follow up. The invasive human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB- 231 was used to over-express NWASP, with over-expression resulting in cells with reduced motility and invasion, increased adhesion to the basement membrane and more significantly, reduced tumour growth in vivo. This has important implications in understanding the mechanism whereby cancer cells become more motile and presents an interesting tool in analysing the progression of human breast cancer. 1...|$|E

Here we show that endocytosis via the GEECs pathway is inhibited by mild depletion of cholesterol, perturbation of actin polymerization or overexpression of the Cdc 42 /Rac-interactive-binding (CRIB) motif of neural Wiskott 2 <b>Aldrich</b> <b>syndrome</b> protein (N-WASP). Consist-ent with the involvement of Cdc 42 -based actin nano-machinery, nascent endocytic vesicles containing cargo for the GEEC pathway co-localize with fluorescent protein-tagged isoforms of Cdc 42, CRIB domain, N-WASP and actin; high-resolution electron microscopy on plasma membrane sheets reveals Cdc 42 -labelled regions rich in green fluorescent protein–GPI. Using total internal reflec-tion fluorescence microscopy at the single-molecule scale, we find that mild cholesterol depletion alters the dynamics of actin polymerization at the cell surface by inhibiting Cdc 42 activation and consequently its stabili-zation at the cell surface. These results suggest that endocytosis into GEECs occurs through a cholesterol-sensitive, Cdc 42 -based recruitment of the actin polymer-ization machinery...|$|E
40|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} {{underlying the}} development of Crohn disease (CD) remain controversial, but sufficient data have been collected to suggest that an uncontrolled immune response within the intestinal mucosa leads to inflammation in a genetically susceptible host. Although lack of mucosal regulatory T cells causes colitis in humans and experimental rodents, patients with CD have more rather than less regulatory activity in the intestine, apparently excluding defects in tolerance {{as the cause of}} CD. Genome-wide association studies have identified many gene variants that confer susceptibility and which seem associated to diminished functioning of especially innate immunity. In apparent agreement, CD patients are impaired with respect to innate immune responses and controlling bacterial flora in the intestine. Furthermore, severe genetic deficiencies in innate immunity, like e. g., lack of NADP oxidase activity or diminished function of the Wiskott <b>Aldrich</b> <b>syndrome</b> protein are associated with colitis in mice and men, and are often mistakenly diagnosed as CD. Thus we favor the view that the primary defect in CD is a lack in innate immunity, causing second tier immunological defenses to combat otherwise easily controlled bacterial breaches of the mucosal barrier...|$|E
40|$|Infection of {{subcutaneous}} tissue with Mycobacterium ulcerans {{can lead to}} chronic skin ulceration known as Buruli ulcer. The pathogenesis of this neglected tropical disease is dependent on a lipid-like toxin, mycolactone, which diffuses through tissue away from the infecting organisms. Since its identification in 1999, this molecule has been intensely studied to elucidate its cytotoxic and immunosuppressive properties. Two recent major advances identifying the underlying molecular targets for mycolactone have been described. First, it can target scaffolding proteins (such as Wiskott <b>Aldrich</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Protein), which control actin dynamics in adherent cells and therefore lead to detachment and cell death by anoikis. Second, it prevents the co-translational translocation (and therefore production) of many proteins that pass through the endoplasmic reticulum for secretion or placement in cell membranes. These pleiotropic effects underpin the range of cell-specific functional defects in immune and other cells that contact mycolactone during infection. The dose and duration of mycolactone exposure for these different cells explains tissue necrosis and the paucity of immune cells in the ulcers. This review discusses recent advances in the field, revisits older findings in this context and highlights current developments in structure-function studies as well as methodology that make mycolactone a promising diagnostic biomarker...|$|E
40|$|The most {{consistent}} feature of Wiskott <b>Aldrich</b> <b>syndrome</b> (WAS) is profound thrombocytopenia with small platelets. The responsible gene encodes WAS protein (WASP), which functions in leucocytes as an actin filament nucleating agent -yet- actin filament nucleation proceeds normally in patient platelets regarding shape change, filopodia and lamellipodia generation. Because WASP localizes in the platelet membrane skeleton and is mobilized by alphaIIbbeta 3 integrin outside-in signalling, we questioned whether its function might {{be linked to}} integrin. Agonist-induced alphaIIbbeta 3 activation (PAC- 1 binding) was normal for patient platelets, indicating normal integrin inside-out signalling. Inside-out signalling (fibrinogen, JON/A binding) was also normal for wasp-deficient murine platelets. However, adherence/spreading on immobilized fibrinogen was decreased for patient platelets and wasp-deficient murine platelets, indicating decreased integrin outside-in responses. Another integrin outside-in dependent response, fibrin clot retraction, involving contraction of the post-aggregation actin cytoskeleton, was also decreased for patient platelets and wasp-deficient murine platelets. Rebleeding from tail cuts was more frequent for wasp-deficient mice, suggesting decreased stabilisation of the primary platelet plug. In contrast, phosphatidylserine exposure, a pro-coagulant response, was enhanced for WASP-deficient patient and murine platelets. The collective results reveal a novel function for WASP in regulating pro-aggregatory and pro-coagulant responses downstream of integrin outside-in signalling...|$|E
40|$|The A kinase {{anchoring}} protein 350 (AKAP 350) is a multiply spliced type II {{protein kinase}} A anchoring protein that localizes to the centrosomes in most cells {{and to the}} Golgi apparatus in epithelial cells. In the present study, we sought to identify AKAP 350 interacting proteins that could yield insights into AKAP 350 function at the Golgi apparatus. Using yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays, we found that AKAP 350 interacts with a family of structurally related proteins, including FBP 17, FBP 17 b, and cdc 42 interacting protein 4 (CIP 4). CIP 4 interacts with the GTP-bound form of cdc 42, with the Wiscott <b>Aldrich</b> <b>Syndrome</b> group of proteins, and with microtubules, and exerts regulatory effects on cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking. CIP 4 is phosphorylated by protein kinase A in vitro, and elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP with forskolin stimulates in situ phosphorylation of CIP 4. Our results indicate that CIP 4 interacts with AKAP 350 at the Golgi apparatus and that either disruption of this interaction by expressing the CIP 4 binding domain in AKAP 350, or reduction of AKAP 350 expression by RNA interference leads to changes in Golgi structure. The results suggest that AKAP 350 and CIP 4 influence the maintenance of normal Golgi apparatus structure...|$|E
