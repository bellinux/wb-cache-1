In this paper we present a new algorithm to compute a set of points meeting every semi-algebraically connected component of each non-empty sign condition of P overV. Its complexity issk′ + 1 dO(k). This interpolates a sequence of results between the Ben-Or–Kozen–Reif algorithm which is the casek′ = 0, in one variable, and the Basu–Pollack–Roy algorithm which is the casek′ =k.

5|$|Moving from {{individual}} graphs to graph families, if {{a family of}} graphs has the property that every subgraph of a graph in the family {{is also in the}} family, and every graph in the family has <b>at</b> <b>most</b> as many edges as vertices, then the family contains only pseudoforests. For instance, every subgraph of a thrackle (a graph drawn so that every pair of edges has one point of intersection) is also a thrackle, so Conway's conjecture that every thrackle has <b>at</b> <b>most</b> as many edges as vertices can be restated as saying that every thrackle is a pseudoforest. A more precise characterization is that, if the conjecture is true, then the thrackles are exactly the pseudoforests with no four-vertex cycle and <b>at</b> <b>most</b> one odd cycle.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen gas is an {{industrial}} gas {{produced by the}} fractional distillation of liquid air, or by mechanical means using gaseous air (pressurised reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption). Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen). Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains <b>at</b> <b>most</b> 20ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing <b>at</b> <b>most</b> 2ppm oxygen and 10ppm argon are also available.|$|E
