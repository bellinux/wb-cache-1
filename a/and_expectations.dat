5|$|In December 2008, Paul Krugman {{released}} his book The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008, arguing that economic {{conditions similar to}} what existed during the earlier part of the 20th century had returned, making Keynesian policy prescriptions more relevant than ever. In February 2009 Robert J. Shiller and George Akerlof published , a book where they argue the current US stimulus package is too small as {{it does not take}} into account Keynes's insight on the importance of confidence <b>and</b> <b>expectations</b> in determining the future behaviour of businesspeople and other economic agents.|$|E
5|$|One {{does not}} only feel a social or {{external}} pressure to fulfill roles <b>and</b> <b>expectations</b> {{of being a}} good parent, sibling, or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal pressure to be ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, sibling and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in advertisements appeals to one's motives, attitudes and personalities. The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it appeals to the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or parent-child relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for her child due to her social role <b>and</b> <b>expectations,</b> but also because she feels an emotional attachment to her child. The attempt to activate the emotions of audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among advertisements. Family affects us significantly on this psychological level – {{the level at which}} advertisements are most effective.|$|E

5|$|Among Western Europeans, {{there had}} long been rumors <b>and</b> <b>expectations</b> that a great Christian ally would come from the East. These rumors {{circulated}} {{as early as the}} First Crusade (1096–1099), and usually surged in popularity after the Crusaders lost a battle. A legend arose about a figure known as Prester John, who lived in far-off India, Central Asia, or perhaps even Ethiopia. This legend developed a life of its own, and some individuals who came from the East were greeted with expectations that they might be forces sent by the long-awaited Prester John. In 1210, news reached the West of the battles of the Mongol Kuchlug (d. 1218), leader of the largely Christian tribe of the Naimans. Kuchlug's forces had been battling the powerful Khwarezmian Empire, whose leader was the Muslim Muhammad II of Khwarezm. Rumors circulated in Europe that Kuchlug was the mythical Prester John, again battling the Muslims in the East.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Asylums boss fights were criticized, {{with many}} reviewers {{labeling}} {{them as the}} game's biggest failing. Reviewers found that the battles often rely on old-fashioned, tedious, and repetitive game tropes that required the player to learn and repeat monotonous routinessome of which, {{in the case of}} Bane, had already been employed on lesser enemiesor to confront repetitive attack patterns and one-hit deaths. Reviewers generally agreed that the fights were anti-climactic to their build-up spectacle. The final boss fight with the Joker was singled out for vapid gameplay, a battle with Killer Croc was labeled boring and overly long, and the reviewers said these should not have been in the game. However, the fear toxin-induced hallucination segments of Scarecrow's battles were almost unanimously praised as some of the game's best and most cerebral moments for their fourth wall manipulation, subversion of the game's established narrative <b>and</b> <b>expectations,</b> and meta-textual influences that were compared to the battle against Psycho Mantis in 1998's Metal Gear Solid, and 2002's Eternal Darkness.|$|E

It was California's first winning season since 1993, and came {{on the heels of}} a 1–10 season in 2001. New head coach Jeff Tedford was praised for turning the program around so quickly, <b>and</b> <b>expectations</b> were high heading into the 2003 season. Tedford was awarded a new five-year contract in the offseason, and in the annual preseason poll of media covering the Pac-10 conference, Cal was picked to finish eighth in the 10-team organization.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to explore the {{influence}} of future orientation training on student 2 ̆ 7 s future orientation improvement and relationship between future orientation <b>and</b> <b>expectation</b> for learning success. This study involved 37 of tenth grade students in one of private Senior High School in Semarang. The research used quantitative method with experiment approach and one group pre- test post-test design to test find out the difference between students 2 ̆ 7 future orientation before and after training and explore the correlation between students 2 ̆ 7 future orientation <b>and</b> <b>expectation</b> for student learning success. Result showed that there was a significant difference of future orientation before and after training, (Z = - 5, 304). Correlation analysis between future orientation <b>and</b> <b>expectation</b> for student 2 ̆ 7 s learning success showed that there was relationship between future orientation <b>and</b> <b>expectation</b> for student 2 ̆ 7 s learning success, with correlation r = 0. 477. implication of these results for the study of future orientation <b>and</b> <b>expectation</b> for student 2 ̆ 7 s learning success are exlpored...|$|R

5|$|The {{conventional}} {{level of}} moral reasoning {{is typical of}} adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views <b>and</b> <b>expectations.</b> The conventional level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E
5|$|Further {{indicative}} of the role cognitive flexibility plays in education is the argument that how students are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students’ ability to store and readily access information. A crucial aim of education is to help students learn as well as appropriately apply and adapt {{what they have learned}} to novel situations. This is reflected in the integration of cognitive flexibility into educational policy regarding academic guidelines <b>and</b> <b>expectations.</b> For example, as outlined in the , a standards-based education reform developed to increase high school graduation rates, educators are expected to present within the classroom “high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep conceptual understanding through the application of content knowledge and skills to new situations.” This guideline within the Common Core Initiative is the essence of cognitive flexibility, and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A counterexample is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain.|$|E
