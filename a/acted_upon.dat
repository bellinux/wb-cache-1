5|$|Control of Sandwedge {{was passed}} to G.

5|$|The {{molecules}} {{bound and}} <b>acted</b> <b>upon</b> by enzymes are called substrates. Although enzymes can consist {{of hundreds of}} amino acids, it is usually {{only a small fraction}} of the residues that come in contact with the substrate, and an even smaller fraction—three to four residues on average—that are directly involved in catalysis. The region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site.|$|E
5|$|To {{members of}} the WFM, {{it became clear that}} {{government}} favored the companies, and only direct action by organized workers could secure the eight-hour day for themselves.

5|$|Following {{his return}} to California, Col.

The board, which {{became known as the}} Alexander Commission, conducted a survey of the California Central Valley throughout the summer and fall of 1873. The Commission's report declared that large-scale irrigation was possible and that much land could be reclaimed from the swamps around the Sacramento River. The report was not initially <b>acted</b> <b>upon,</b> but was the first professional survey of the valley and set the stage for further development.|$|E
5|$|Part of Johnson's {{campaign}} for relief was {{the abolition of}} the practice of debt imprisonment nationwide. It would take him nearly ten years to see this goal accomplished. He first spoke to the issue in the Senate on December 14, 1822, introducing a bill to end the practice, and pointing to the positive effects its cessation had effected in his home state. The bill failed, but Johnson persisted in re-introducing it every year. In 1824, it passed the Senate, but was too late to be <b>acted</b> <b>upon</b> by the House. It passed the Senate a second time in 1828, but again, the House failed to act on it, and the measure died for some years, owing to Johnson's exit from the Senate the next year.|$|E
5|$|President Andrew Johnson {{appointed}} Ewing as U.S. Minister to Holland, {{where he}} served from 1866 to 1870. This appointment may have drawn the ire of the Radical Republicans, for Speaker of the House James G. Blaine urged President Ulysses S. Grant that Ewing be recalled and replaced with his brother, Charles Ewing. Blaine told the President that Hugh was 'acting badly'. Blaine himself was disingenuous, having represented to prominent politicians in Ohio including Senator John Sherman {{that he was doing}} everything possible to nominate his close personal friend, former Ohio General Roeliff Brinkerhoff, for the post. Nonetheless, Blaine's request to recall General Ewing was never <b>acted</b> <b>upon,</b> possibly due to the influence of his sister, whose husband General Sherman was a very close friend to President Grant.|$|E

5|$|Stanley <b>acted</b> <b>upon</b> {{a remark}} made {{by his father}} in 1854 about the high cost and poor quality of English drawing {{instruments}} compared to those imported from France and Switzerland, and started a business making mathematical and drawing instruments. At first he rented a shop and parlour at 3 Great Turnstile, Holborn, and began the business with £100 capital. He invented a new T-square which improved the standard one and became universally used. A cousin, Henry Robinson, joined him with a capital of £150, but died in 1859. Stanley stopped using the name Robinson and changed his signature {{as a consequence of}} being robbed of his cheque book during the early days of his business.|$|E
5|$|The Christians {{responded to}} these {{actions of the}} central {{government}} with a fresh wave of fury against the Jews so that in late May violence was in the air. The Jews described many cases in which they were assaulted or beaten by the Greeks, and the sons of the British and the Greek consuls were among those who beat up a number of Jews. When the Jews complained to the governor, he ordered the complainants subjected to four to five hundred blows of the bastinado. The qadi disassociated himself from the actions of the governor, who declared that he had <b>acted</b> <b>upon</b> the demands of the consuls. On top of that, the governor ordered five other Jews arrested.|$|E

5|$|Because of his {{activities}} within the Communist Party (which was illegal in Japan), Nosaka, like many communists in Japan, was arrested (twice in his case), interrogated, and tortured by the Japanese kempeitai, {{but he was}} released after short periods both times. Nosaka was first arrested in 1923, and released within a year. After his release, Nosaka became more active within the Japanese labor movement. In March 1928, the Japanese police began a campaign to harass and destroy the JCP, beginning with the May 15 Incident. After his second arrest in 1929, Nosaka {{spent two years in}} jail. He was released in 1931 on the grounds of illness. The short lengths of Nosaka's arrests aroused suspicion among other Japanese communists that Nosaka had given important information to the Japanese secret police, but these suspicions were never <b>acted</b> <b>upon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for Villiers, {{his case}} {{was not to}} be prosecuted with the utmost rigour. He was to some degree {{protected}} by the joint efforts of Boringdon's friends and the Whig George Tierney, as well as his own quick action in surrendering his property through writs of extent; and the delinquency of Joseph Hunt, Treasurer of the Ordnance attracted attention and saved Villiers from the full wrath of the finance committee. Their report on the matter noted that the writ of extent had been to the amount of £264,000, but only £91,000 had been raised from the sale of his property, and about £30,000 from securities and the bond posted for him when he took office. The committee recommended the abolition of the office of Paymaster of Marines and the transfer of its duties to the Treasurer of the Navy, a recommendation which was not immediately <b>acted</b> <b>upon.</b> Villiers was left, in Boringdon's estimation, with a debt of £1,500–2,000, an annual income of £2,000–3,000, and the property in Cranbourne Lodge.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 the keeper's {{quarters}} {{went through}} major repairs, replacing the original slate tiles with terracotta ones. This was followed with {{the replacement of}} the steps handrail in 1903. A 1903 report criticised the light, saying that the red flashes were only visible for half the distance of the white ones, confusing navigators. This led to a recommendation to remove the red shades, resulting in a new characteristic of one white flash every minute, and later to upgrade the light to a quick group flashing dioptric light. Another report in 1912 stated that the station was in good condition, but criticised the low power of the light, and recommended withdrawing two of the keepers. However, all of these recommendations were not <b>acted</b> <b>upon</b> until 1 July 1922, when the apparatus was upgraded to a revolving Dalén light with an intensity of 20,000cd, and the manning reduced to two keepers. In 1932 the original gallery handrails, also supplied by H Wilkins & Co., were replaced with steel gas pipe and mild steel rods.|$|E
