Analyzing data from a report released in 1997 by the National Institute of Justice, fewer than 2% of convicted criminals bought their firearm <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market</b> or gun show. About 12% purchased their firearm from a retail store or pawnshop, and 80% bought from family, friends, or an illegal source.|$|E
5|$|Norman Dolph's {{original}} acetate {{recording of}} the Scepter Studios material contains several recordings {{that would make it}} onto the final album, though many are different mixes of those recordings and three are different takes entirely. The acetate was cut on April 25, 1966, shortly after the recording sessions. It would resurface decades later when it was bought by collector Warren Hill of Montreal, Quebec, Canada in September 2002 <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market</b> in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City for $0.75. Hill put the album up for auction on eBay in November. On December 8, 2006, a winning bid for $155,401 was placed, but not honored. The album was again placed for auction on eBay and was successfully sold on December 16, 2006 for $25,200.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{five years}} later, the Soviet Union militarily {{intervenes}} in Afghanistan. Amir and Baba escape to Peshawar, Pakistan, {{and then to}} Fremont, California, where they settle in a run-down apartment. Baba begins work at a gas station. After graduating from high school, Amir takes classes at San Jose State University to develop his writing skills. Every Sunday, Baba and Amir make extra money selling used goods <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market</b> in San Jose. There, Amir meets fellow refugee Soraya Taheri and her family. Baba is diagnosed with terminal cancer but is still capable of granting Amir one last favor: he asks Soraya's father's permission for Amir to marry her. He agrees and the two marry. Shortly thereafter Baba dies. Amir and Soraya settle down in a happy marriage, but to their sorrow they learn that they cannot have children.|$|E

5|$|The Mountain Eagle is {{the only}} feature film {{directed}} by Hitchcock that is considered a lost film, meaning that no prints of the film are known to exist. Six surviving stills are reproduced in François Truffaut's book. More stills have recently been found to exist, {{many of which are}} reproduced in Dan Auiler's book. A lobby card for the film was found in a box of broken frames <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market</b> in Rowley, Massachusetts. In 2012, a set of 24 still photographs were found in an archive of one of Hitchcock's close friends. Although these images gave clues to the film and its story, they were taken on the set rather than being stills from the film itself. They were auctioned off in Los Angeles for $6,000 (£3,700). Hitchcock's notebooks were also found, documenting his journey to Obergurgl, by train, horse and cart, and by foot.|$|E

25|$|In November 1993 Chinese paleontologists Zhou Zhonge, Hu Yoaming and Hou Lianhai, of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at Beijing, were {{presented}} a bird fossil bought <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market</b> in Sihetun by amateur paleontologist Zhang He. It showed a partial {{skeleton of a}} bird new to science of which even some feather remains had been preserved. In December 1993 two further specimens were acquired from a farmer, Yang Yushan. Soon afterwards, {{it was discovered that}} local farmers {{were in the process of}} collecting hundreds of specimens that were provisionally prepared by them to be illegally sold to commercial fossil dealers. Many hundreds have since also been added to the official collections of Chinese institutions. In 2010 the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature alone possessed 536 specimens. The fossils are compressed but otherwise typically very complete often showing the entire feathering of the animal.|$|E

500|$|Aquemini {{begins with}} the {{introductory}} track [...] "Hold On, Be Strong", which was written by session guitarist Donny Mathis and was originally a full song with verses, but the group preferred to only use the hook. André 3000 played a kalimba on the song after purchasing the instrument <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market,</b> drawing inspiration from Earth, Wind & Fire. [...] "Return of the G" [...] addresses concerns from fans who felt that the group's style had changed too drastically since the release of Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, {{as well as those}} who make poor decisions in order to keep their street credibility. When discussing the lyrical content of the song, André 3000 explained, [...] "I was young and wilder and some of my fashion choices people didn't accept at the time. I started getting flak from some people, so they were like, 'Either he's gay or on drugs'... 'Return of the Gangsta' was trying to give them a sense of, 'Hey, I'm still a regular person.'" [...] "Rosa Parks" [...] contains blues-influenced guitar work and folksy harmonies that [...] "announce OutKast's distinctive style of Southern boogie. The groove goes into overdrive during a clapping, foot-stomping breakdown funkified by a fierce harmonica as the kick drum pounds incessantly." ...|$|E
500|$|Lindelof {{compared}} the film's Romulan faction to pirates with their bald, tattooed heads and disorganized costuming. Their ship, Narada, is purely practical with visible mechanics {{as it is}} a [...] "working ship", unlike the Enterprise crew who give a respectable presentation on behalf of the Federation. Chambliss was heavily influenced by the architecture of Antoni Gaudí for Narada, who created buildings that appeared to be inside out: by making the ship's exposed wires appear like bones or ligaments, it would create a foreboding atmosphere. The ship's interior was made of six pieces that could be rearranged to create a different room. The Romulan actors had three prosthetics applied to their ears and foreheads, while Bana had a fourth prosthetic for the bitemark on his ear that extends {{to the back of his}} character's head. The film's Romulans lacked the 'V'-shaped ridges on the foreheads, which had been present in all of their depictions outside the original series. Neville Page wanted to honor that by having Nero's crew ritually scar themselves too, forming keloids reminiscent of the 'V'-ridges. It was abandoned as they did not pursue the idea enough. Kaplan wanted aged, worn and rugged clothes for the Romulans because of their mining backgrounds, and found some greasy looking fabrics <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market.</b> Kaplan tracked down the makers of those clothes, who were discovered to be based in Bali, and commissioned them to create his designs.|$|E
50|$|The first CD of Unknown Mystery 60's Group songs was {{released}} by Distortions Records (DR 1040) in 1997.

Nothing was known about the group except for the song titles which were written on the tape box.

5000|$|The lyrics for [...] "Right Action" [...] were {{inspired}} by a postcard found by lead singer Alex Kapranos <b>at</b> <b>a</b> London <b>flea</b> <b>market</b> that contained the words [...] "come home, practically all is nearly forgiven". The song was first used in the album trailer for Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action. On 27 June 2013, the official audio track was released on YouTube and made available for digital download. The official video for [...] "Right Action" [...] was released on 7 July on the band's Vevo channel. The single was also released physically as a translucent neon pink 7" [...] double A side, with [...] "Love Illumination" [...] being the other single.|$|R
5000|$|As a young chef in Brussels, Coumont {{could not}} find the right bread for his restaurant. [...] Passionate about quality, he {{returned}} to his roots and opened a small bakery where he could knead flour, salt and water into the rustic loaves of his childhood. Coumont opened his bakery in rue Antoine Dansaert in Brussels in 1990, in those days an avant-garde quarter of Belgian fashion. He named his bakery “Le Pain Quotidien.” Brussels quickly took to the taste of this traditional bread. Alain evolved his offering to include simple salads and tartines, keeping bread the cornerstone of the menu. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> local <b>flea</b> <b>market,</b> Coumont found <b>a</b> long table where his guests could sit to eat together; it became Le Pain Quotidien’s first communal table.|$|R

2500|$|Van Gogh made Pair of Shoes (F255) {{from a pair}} {{of boots}} he {{purchased}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market.</b> [...] He wore the boots on an extended rainy walk to create the effect he wished for this painting, which may have been a tribute to the working man. [...] The Van Gogh Museum speculates that they may also be symbolic for Van Gogh of his [...] "difficult passage through life." [...] Of his walking through mud to make the shoes look more worn and dirty, Van Gogh was known to say [...] "Dirty shoes and roses can both be good in the same way." ...|$|E
5000|$|His first guitar {{was an old}} {{acoustic}} guitar that his mother bought him <b>at</b> <b>a</b> local <b>flea</b> <b>market</b> for <b>a</b> few pounds; he was nine at the time. He and his brother Dik Evans both experimented with this instrument. He said in 1982 of this early experimentation, [...] "I suppose the first link in the chain was {{a visit to the}} local jumble sale where I purchased a guitar for a pound. That was my first instrument. It was an {{acoustic guitar}} and me and my elder brother Dik both played it, plonking away, all very rudimentary stuff, open chords and all that." [...] The Edge has stated that many of his guitar parts are based around guitar effects. This is especially true from the Achtung Baby era onwards, although much of the band's 1980s material made heavy use of echos.|$|R
40|$|Marc Dion, in {{collaboration}} with British artist Robert Williams, borrowed the scheme of the family tree to demonstrate how classification systems {{have been used to}} give order to a complex world. In Et in Arcadia Ego, Dion presents a hierarchy of terms referring to utopias, the afterlife, and other planes of existence. In Hic Existo Monstrum, he lists mythological monsters, among them, the names of bogeymen invented by the artists’ children. In Theatrum Universale Omnium Historia Naturae, he devises a visual history of those who advanced science. In Summum Bonum Quod Est Magiae, Cabalae, Alchymae et Artis, he acknowledges the interrelationship between art, science, alchemy, and mysticism, mentioning artists from Dürer to Jannis Kounellis and Louise Bourgeois. Into each of these lithographs Dion incorporated details from four 18 th-century prints that he found <b>at</b> <b>an</b> Antwerp <b>flea</b> <b>market.</b> He believes there was originally a fifth print in that series, and should he find it, he and Williams intend to make an additional lithograph to complete their suite...|$|R
5000|$|Agnès {{had mixed}} twins at 19 and she {{separated}} from their father Christian Bourgois at 20. She graduated from École du Louvre in Paris. A career soon followed when her personal style caught the eyes of Elle magazine staffers <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Paris <b>flea</b> <b>market.</b> Her style of dress at the time, which included selections from France's Monoprix discount chain, was inspired less by fashion than thrift, but the magazine liked what it saw and hired her as a junior editor. With a mind towards designing rather than editing fashion, she left ELLE after less than two years, preferring apprenticeships even when they paid little and offered no time off. She became a designer, buyer, and press attaché for Dorothée Bis in Paris. She freelance designed for Limitex, Pierre d’Alby, V de V, and Eversbin in the years 1965 and '66. In the latter year, she founded CMC (Comptoir Mondial de Creation), parent of the agnès b. label. She opened her first boutique in Les Halles in 1975. Formerly a butcher shop, {{the black and white}} tiled store had a rustic, communal atmosphere, defined by an indoor swing for children and an impromptu aviary (in reality an on-site bird population that over time grew from two to 30). Birds flew free in the cavernous space, built nests and hatched their chicks in the displays. [...] "It was very cool" [...] she says [...] "We were writing on the walls." [...] agnès's friends were her first repeat customers.|$|R
2500|$|The band {{shortened}} {{its name}} to Dr. Hook in 1975. They signed with Capitol in 1975 with the aptly titled album Bankrupt. Unlike previous projects, this album included original material written by the group. The hit from the project was a reworked version of Sam Cooke's [...] "Only Sixteen", revitalizing their career and charted in the top ten in 1976. [...] It was when Haffkine found a little tune called A Little Bit More, written and originally performed by Bobby Gosh, on a vinyl record, released on his 1973 album Sitting in the Quiet. [...] <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>flea</b> <b>market</b> for 35 cents in San Francisco, things exploded for Dr. Hook. [...] It charted at number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and spent two weeks at number nine on the Cash Box Top 100. It reached number two on the UK Singles Chart. It was Dr. Hook's joint second-best UK chart placing, matching [...] "Sylvia's Mother" [...] and surpassed only by [...] "When You're in Love with a Beautiful Woman when it reached number 1 for several weeks in 1979 in the UK.
