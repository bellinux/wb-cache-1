5|$|Some second-tier {{defendants}} {{were unable to}} post bail because the government refused to permit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) legal defense fund to provide bail funding. The CRC had run afoul of the judicial system because it had posted bail for the 1949 trial defendants, and four of those defendants skipped bail in 1951. Leaders of the CRC were called {{before a grand jury}} and <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the donors who had contributed money to the bail fund. Novelist Dashiell Hammett, a manager of the CRC fund, invoked the Fifth Amendment, refused to identify donors, and was sentenced to six months in prison.|$|E
5|$|In {{another study}} that {{appeared}} in the British Journal of Psychology, researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from ArtCyclopedia by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Georges-Pierre Seurat, and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stafford and Cernan, still {{circling}} in {{the clouds}} in the second T-38, {{had no idea what}} had happened to their flight partners. Air traffic controllers were confused by the two planes in flight attempting different abort actions after the initial missed approach, and moreover no one on the ground knew who was in the crashed plane. After some delay, Stafford and Cernan were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> themselves and given permission to land, but they were not informed of the crash until on the ground. Although personally distraught over the loss of his close colleagues and friends, Stafford acted as NASA's chief contact on the scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in the day.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 March, Triton spotted Guam and {{observed}} activity on shore via her periscope. Petty Officer Edward Carbullido (pictured), who had been born on Guam but had not returned home for 14 years, was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> his parents' house through the periscope while the boat remained submerged in Agat Bay. Triton then changed course for the Philippines, the midpoint of her around-the-world voyage. Carbullido was subsequently able {{to go home to}} Guam for Christmas Day 1960 on a 60-day leave, with the cost of his flight paid for by selling a magazine article on Tritons circumnavigation written by Captain Beach, and with the assistance of Pan American Airways.|$|E
5|$|As the {{deadline}} of noon approached, set {{the previous day}} {{for the release of}} the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that the gunmen did not have the capability to carry out their threat of blowing up the embassy, and persuaded Oan to agree to a new deadline of 14:00. The police allowed {{the deadline}} to pass, to no immediate response from the gunmen. During the afternoon, Oan altered his demands, requesting that the British media broadcast a statement of the group's grievances and for ambassadors of three Arab countries to negotiate the group's safe passage out of the UK once the statement had been broadcast. At approximately 20:00, Oan became agitated by noises coming from the Ethiopian Embassy next door. The noise came from technicians who were drilling holes in the wall to implant listening devices, but PC Trevor Lock, when <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the sound, attributed it to mice. COBRA decided to create ambient noise to cover the sound created by the technicians and instructed British Gas to commence drilling in an adjacent road, supposedly to repair a gas main. The drilling was aborted after it agitated the gunmen, and instead British Airports Authority, owner of London Heathrow Airport, was told to instruct approaching aircraft to fly over the embassy at low altitude.|$|E

30|$|To summarize, in Study ‐ I, three {{different}} kinds of questions are used with varying difficulty level. Specifically, Type ‐ 1 question <b>asks</b> users <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the locations visited for a given day. Type ‐ 2 question <b>asks</b> users <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the locations and the order of visits for a given day. Finally, Type ‐ 3 question <b>asks</b> users <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the locations and the time window when the places are visited for a given day. In each case, possible answers to challenge questions are presented {{in the form of}} multiple choices to facilitate recall. In contrast, in Study ‐ II, Type ‐ 4 question asks where a user was at a certain time. In this case, users are shown a map (i.e., possible answers are not presented) and are <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> select locations that he/she has visited during a certain time window for a specific day.|$|R

30|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} different question styles on user performance, we designed two separate studies as follows. During {{the course of the}} first study, we asked three different kinds of questions. Type ‐ 1 question <b>asks</b> users <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the locations visited at a specific time. Type ‐ 2 question <b>asks</b> users <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the locations and the order of visits for a given day. Finally, Type ‐ 3 question <b>asks</b> users <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the locations and the time window when the places are visited for a given day. In each case, possible answers to challenge questions were presented in the form of multiple choices. To simplify the authentication process and improve the usability of the system, possible answers to each authentication question are presented to the user in visual form by mapping each place to a location on a map generated using Google Maps Street View service(see Fig. 3).|$|R

25|$|On 18 April 1987, the Pakistani {{troops at}} Quaid Post fired on the Indian {{soldiers}} at Sonam (6,400 m), killing two of them. The Indian Army then launched {{a plan to}} evict the Pakistanis from the Quaid Post. The 8th Battalion of the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (8th JAK LI) was given the task of capturing the Quaid Post. On May 29, a 13-member JAK LI patrol led by Second Lieutenant Rajiv Pande was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the best approach route to the Post, and mark it with ropes. The group started climbing the ice wall leading to the Quaid Post, but were detected by the Pakistani soldiers, when it was just 30 m from the top. The Pakistanis opened fire with a heavy machine gun, killing ten Indian soldiers, including Second Lieutenant Rajiv Pande. Before they were killed, the Indian soldiers managed to establish a number of footholds on the vertical ice wall with a pick axe, and had laid a rope to the top.|$|E
25|$|A {{circuit board}} fragment, {{allegedly}} found {{embedded in a}} piece of charred material, was identified as part of an electronic timer similar to one found on a Libyan intelligence agent who had been arrested 10 months previously for carrying materials for a Semtex bomb. The timer was allegedly traced through its Swiss manufacturer, Mebo, to the Libyan military, and Mebo employee Ulrich Lumpert identified the fragment at al-Megrahi's trial. Mebo's owner, Edwin Bollier, testified at the trial that the Scottish police had originally shown him a fragment of a brown 8-ply circuit board from a prototype timer which had never been supplied to Libya. Yet the sample he was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> at the trial was a green 9-ply circuit board that Mebo had indeed supplied to Libya. Bollier wanted to pursue this discrepancy, but was told by trial judge Lord Sutherland that he could not do so.
