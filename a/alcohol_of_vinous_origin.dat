40|$|Introduction: The {{current study}} {{investigated}} partner effects and bidirectional parent-child effects in family alcohol use. Methods: A full family, longitudinal design {{was used to}} test the hypotheses. Participants were 428 families, including mothers, fathers, and 2 children. Associations were measured over two waves with a 2 -year interval, by means of structural equation modeling. Results: Whereas <b>alcohol</b> use <b>of</b> the younger children was affected by <b>alcohol</b> use <b>of</b> both parents, <b>alcohol</b> use <b>of</b> the older children was only affected by <b>alcohol</b> use <b>of</b> mother. Moreover, although the effects were small, <b>alcohol</b> use <b>of</b> older children affected later <b>alcohol</b> use <b>of</b> both parents. Conclusions: Associations between <b>alcohol</b> use <b>of</b> parents and children seem to be bidirectional. Future studies are needed to find out whether these findings are incidental or structural. If the effects are structural, potential underlying reciprocal processes within the family {{play a role in the}} development <b>of</b> adolescent <b>alcohol</b> use. Copyright © 2008 S.

And then, again, excuse me--we Florentines have liberal ideas about speech, and consider that an instrument which can flatter and promise so cleverly as the tongue, must have been partly made for those purposes; and that truth is a riddle for eyes and wit to discover, which it were a mere spoiling of sport for the tongue to betray. Still we have our limits beyond which we call dissimulation treachery. But it is said of the Greeks that their honesty begins at what is the hanging point with us, and that since the old Furies went to sleep, your Christian Greek is of so easy a conscience that he would make a stepping-stone of his father's corpse." ...|$|R
