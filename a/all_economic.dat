5|$|The {{international}} community’s {{political stance}} towards Kampuchea had a severe {{impact on the}} Vietnamese economy, which was already wrecked by decades of continuous conflicts. The United States, which already had sanctions in place against Vietnam, convinced other countries of the United Nations to deprive Vietnam and the People’s Republic of Kampuchea of much-needed funds by denying them membership to major international organisations such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In 1979 Japan stepped up the pressure by suspending <b>all</b> <b>economic</b> aid to Vietnam, and warned Vietnamese leaders that economic aid would only resume when Vietnam amended its policies towards Kampuchea, the Sino-Soviet rivalry {{and the problem of}} the boat people. Sweden, which was considered the staunchest supporter of Vietnam in the West, also considered reducing its commitments to the communist country as virtually every other country cancelled its aid.|$|E
5|$|The various health {{problems}} associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries, motor vehicle accidents (due to drunk driving), domestic violence, and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified {{the cost to the}} UK of all forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion. <b>All</b> <b>economic</b> costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5 billion.|$|E

He pointed out that the traditional tendencies in economic theory preferred the causal approach and that they concentrated on the search and research of the causal connections in economic reality and the they missed the knowledge of the sense of human doings. In the basis of these ideas he elaborated the economic science dealing with the systems in which <b>all</b> the <b>economic</b> activity takes place.
