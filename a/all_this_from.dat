25|$|The point {{really about}} <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>from</b> our {{perspective}} {{has been that}} the critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. We could have stepped aside from that task and then shouted, {{and that would be the}} end of our contribution... They would shout back at us and that would be the end of the story. I'm actually the only head of government that I know anywhere in the world who has actually gone to Zimbabwe and spoken publicly very critically of the things that they are doing.|$|E
25|$|Aerin helped Morwen in secret, and {{was beaten}} by Brodda for this. He was always afraid of Morwen, {{but when she}} finally {{departed}} from Dor-lómin, he took for himself {{all that remained of}} her household. When Túrin Turambar, son of Húrin, returned to Dor-lómin in Y.S. 495, he learned <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>from</b> Aerin, and in his rage he killed Brodda. The beggars of the former Folk of Hador that were in his house revolted then, and many were slain on both sides. Survivors fled into hiding, but Aerin's fate was sealed, and she burnt herself alive in Brodda's hall. The remainder of the House of Hador now was persecuted even more cruelly.|$|E

The radio station put [...] "Keep Away" [...] into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly. Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of [...] "Keep Away", Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled [...] "Whatever", which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM). In an interview Sully Erna stated, [...] "We had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All of a sudden we started moving over a thousand records a week. (...) I was doing <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>from</b> my bedroom. After years of grinding away, things finally started taking off".|$|E

2500|$|Upon the Elevator's departure, {{the staff}} and astronauts go aboard, and the Knids consume twenty-four of the staff, while the others escape. The Knids dive-bomb the shuttle, {{destroying}} the rockets, cameras, and radio antenna, apparently stranding the occupants in space. Seeing <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>from</b> the [...] "Knidproof" [...] Great Glass Elevator, Charlie suggests {{that he and his}} companions tow the shuttle back to Earth. [...] Wonka pilots the Elevator into range, whereupon Grandpa Joe connects the two vessels by means of a steel cord. The Knids change into living segments of a towing line, with which to capture the two spacecraft, while a single Knid wraps his body around the Elevator to provide an anchor for this operation; whereupon Willy Wonka returns the Elevator to Earth, and the Knids are incinerated in the atmosphere. At the right moment, Mr. Wonka releases the shuttle, which floats safely home. The Elevator then crashes back down through the roof of the chocolate factory, but thanks to Mr. Wonka's expert piloting, the hurtling Elevator perfectly engages inside another of the same shafts that it had exited from in the first book, and rolls smoothly downward to a normal stop inside the factory.|$|E
