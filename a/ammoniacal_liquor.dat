40|$|This study {{focussed}} on extending {{and applying}} techniques to measure hydrodynamic characteristics in treatment units at sewage works. Use {{was made of}} tracer dye studies and a spreadsheet based analysis tool. The resulting infonnation about residence time, tank conguration and pathological behaviour was linked to other infonnation from respirometry and flow and load studies. Characterising the wastewater process will become increasingly important as the economic and compliance drivers {{in the operation of}} wastewater treatment facilities become increasingly pronounced. Case studies at Royton WWTW, Chorley WWTW, Preston WWTW and Montebello WWTW were used to develop, improve and apply the methodology. Tests at Royton and Chorley were used to develop the practical side of conducting tracer studies. The Preston case study was used to improve the diagnostic methodology. It was demonstrated that consent failures as a result of events are usually a result of a number of (linked) factors, in the case of Preston influenced by the tank conguration. The response of a pulse of dye was measured at Preston in vessel outlet throughout the works. The tracer dyeresponse was used to predict the response to a discharge of high <b>ammoniacal</b> leachate <b>liquor</b> and compared to measured data. This type of calibration experiment facilitated the simulation of different discharge event scenarios. The tracer and modelling techniques were incorporated in a general diagnostic methodology, which caters for a phased approach in diagnostic studies. A series of diagnostic tables take the user through cause - effect hypotheses and possible measurement techniques to use in the diagnostic investigation. Although the diagnostic methodology proved to be a versatile asset optimisation tool, which required considerable less effort than deterministic models, implementation in United Utilities' AMP 3 Capital Investment Programme was problematic. The size of the programme and lack of resources forced the company to implement standard rather than tailor-made solutions. However, the diagnostic methodology can easily be applied elsewhere in the wastewater industry...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} novel ion-exchange resins was {{prepared}} {{based upon the}} commercial Magnetic Ion Exchange (MIEXTm) substrate produced by Orica Watercare for the selective adsorption and removal of aurothiosulfate from <b>ammoniacal</b> thiosulfate leach <b>liquors.</b> Gold adsorption by these resins was ascertained using bottle-roll tests both from water and from a synthetic thiosulfate leach solution. Elution of aurothiosulfate from these resins was examined {{using a variety of}} eluents and used to narrow the set of prospective resins. A common synthetic method was utilised, based upon amination using primary, secondary and tertiary amines of the terminal epoxide group present on the MIEXTM substrate using an aqueous solvent. The weak-base resins formed were then dried and solvated in dimethylformamide, followed by alkylation employing a variety of alkyl halides to form quaternary ammonium moieties. Several structurally-related derivatives of imidazole, piperidine, piperazine and diethylamine were prepared with ion-exchange capacities ranging between 0. 5 and 1. 5 mmol/g, dependent on the steric nature of the amine. The strong-base functionalised resins formed by initial amination and alkylation of weak-base groups were then characterised by ion-exchange capacity determination, elemental analysis and attenuated-total-reflectance infrared spectroscopy with results from each of the techniques being comparable. The resin substrate was also characterised using BET surface area analysis and scanning electron microscopy, with surface areas ranging between 40 - 47 m 2 /g. The performance of the resins was compared using a synthetic thiosulfate leach solution (pH- 10. 5) containing gold (20 ppm), copper (200 ppm), ammonia (1. 3 M) and thiosulfate (0. 1 M), with resin gold loadings of aurothiosulfate ranging between 14 and 124 g/kg. Elution studies were performed using acidic thiourea, basic thiocyanate and concentrated nitrate solutions, with all resins showing efficient elution of aurothiosulfate utilising {{one or more of the}} elution regimes, with typical efficiencies in the range of 30 to 75...|$|R
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} main had {{a level of}} a liquid mixture of (initially) water, but, following use, also coal tar, and <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>liquor.</b> Each retort ascension pipe dropped under the water level by at least a small amount, perhaps by an inch, but often considerably more in the earlier days of gas manufacture. The gas evolved from each retort would thus bubble through the liquid and emerge from it into the void above the liquid, where it would mix with the gas evolved from the other retorts and be drawn off through the foul main to the condenser.|$|E

Any excess was flared off. The coal oil and liquor were piped over {{the road to the}} chemical works section where they were processed into various fractions and industrial chemicals.

40|$|A {{reactive}} transport modeling study {{was carried out}} to assess {{the fate of a}} groundwater contamination by <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>liquor</b> from a former coking plant and the associated geochemical response. The simulations over a 45 -year period provide a conclusive explanation and quantitative description of all measured data from observation wells down gradient of the contaminant source. It is shown that cation exchange exerts the main control on the fate of the ammonium plume as it strongly retards the migration of dissolved ammonium. The sorption of ammonium is accompanied by the elution of native cations, an effect that can be seen in some observation wells where ammonium is absent. While phenol has not been detected in the observation wells in recent years, the modeling results suggest that it has completely degraded in the aquifer, which is inferred from the agreement between the simulated and the observed geochemical fingerprint that the degradation of phenol imposes on groundwater composition...|$|E
40|$|Contamination of NH 4 +, as main {{inorganic}} contaminant, {{resulted from}} disposal of <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>liquor</b> at a former coal carbonisation plant at Mansfield, UK. Previous research for evaluating natural attenuation (Davison, 1998; Davison and Lerner, 2000; Jones, 2001; Jones et al., 1998; Jones and Lerner, 2001) revealed strong retardation of NH 4 + in the aquifer due to cation exchange with existing cations on the sediment. After disposal of <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>liquor,</b> NH 4 + entered the aquifer and equilibrium {{took place between}} NH 4 +, the existing cations and the available exchange sites. An existing hydraulic gradient keeps flushing the contaminated aquifer with pristine background water. NH 4 + desorbs progressively due to new cation exchange equilibrium when the input of NH 4 + decreases or eventually stops. In {{order to be able}} to model the reactive transport of NH 4 +, a reaction module is set up for future 2 D/ 3 D reactive transport modelling of NH 4 + using PHT 3 D. In a first approach a conceptual 1 D-model example is considered and two multicomponent reactive transport models, PHT 3 D (Prommer and Barry, 2001; Prommer et al., 1999) and PHREEQC (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999), are compared. In the 1 D-model example, the flushing of ammonium contaminated groundwater by pristine background water is simulated. The included processes are advection, dispersion and cation exchange between NH 4 +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, K+, Na+ and the sediment. As both models are using the same geochemical module, the comparison focuses on the coupling approach between the transport and geochemical modules. Results show that large numbers of pore volumes (i. e., a nondimensional time parameter where elapsed time is divided by the hydrodynamic residence time (Brusseau, 1994)) are needed to flush the NH 4 + off the aquifer sediment. From the comparison of simulation results compiled with the two codes it is clear that an appropriate choice of the reaction step size for the sequential coupling between the transport and geochemistry modules, is a major point for accuracy of the model predictions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{destructive}} distillation of bituminous coals to produce coal gas, coke, coal tar and <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>liquor</b> has left {{many of our}} towns and cities with heavily contaminated gas production and storage sites. Contaminants range from long chain hydrocarbons {{in the form of}} viscous tars, to the much shorter chain highly volatile hydrocarbons. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can form a significant proportion of gasworks waste and some are carcinogenic. Inorganic contaminants include compounds of cyanide, sulphur, ammonia and heavy metals. Each site poses a significant risk to human health, groundwater and the surrounding environment demanding major remediation before its full potential as a brown field development site can be realized. The paper will examine a number of gasworks sites and describe the processes of remediation beginning with the legislative driving force, site investigation, contaminant identification and the formation of a remediation strategy to satisfy both regulatory authorities and clients. Also discussed will be the significant control measures necessary to manage hazards and protect both on site and off site receptors during the remediation process. The authors will summarize with an overview of gasworks remediation, future developments and the options available for the many contaminated sites present in the United Kingdom...|$|E
40|$|Former {{manufactured}} gas plants (FMGPs) are a ubiquitous source of environmental con- tamination. The process of gas production created {{a number of}} by-products, including coal tar and <b>ammoniacal</b> <b>liquor.</b> Coal tar contains a complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds, {{many of which are}} toxic and carcinogenic. It is estimated that over 3000 ± 1000 FMGPs exist in the United Kingdom alone, yet there are few recent publications detailing the analysis of coal tars. The complex composition of coal tar is known to vary due to a number of factors, including production method, temperature and coal type, making the analysis and interpretation of such samples extremely challenging. Environmental forensics is concerned with the source, fate and transport of contaminants. The introduction of recent legislation such as the EU Environmental Liabilities Directive 2004 / 35 /EC, which promotes the "polluters pay" policy, has encouraged the development of accurate and robust scientific methods for the identification of contaminants. Analytical instrumentation is constantly evolving, thus new protocols to trace the origin of contamination must also be developed to utilise these technological advances. Two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) and compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA) are two exam- ples of advanced analytical instruments which have the potential to aid source identification. GCxGC provides enhanced separation of complex mixtures compared to conventional gas chromatographic techniques, while CSIA allows chemically identical contaminants to be compared based on their isotopic composition. In this study, preliminary research investigated the isotopic composition of coal tars, as this technique is currently a major tool for source apportionment in environmental forensics. However, the results demonstrated. that the similar nature of British coals used for gas production at the investigated sites produced similar isotopic values in the resultant tars, making the technique redundant in this case. Therefore, the potential of GCxGC was investigated for ultra resolution chemical fingerprinting of coal tars. Traditionally, chemical fingerprinting of complex mixtures, such as coal tar, is performed using a tiered approach including rigorous sample preparation steps and analysis by multiple instruments. In this work, a new, single-step analytical procedure was developed for the analysis of coal tars by GCxGC. Automated sample extraction techniques combined with GCxGC analyses were employed to provide detailed chemical fingerprinting in a fast, yet accurate, manner. This research represents a major advance in knowledge of compositional variation within coal tars. The enhanced separation of GCxGC provides vast quantities of chemical data which can be difficult to interpret without statistical methods. A multivariate statistical model was developed to provide process-specific classification of coal tars. The statistical model was validated through use of a blind study, indicating that process-specific apportionment of coal tars was achievable. Based on these results, the application of the single-step procedure for environmental forensics on a commercial basis was evaluated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
