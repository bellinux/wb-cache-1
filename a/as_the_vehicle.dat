5|$|The hymn 10.92 of the Rigveda {{states that}} deity Rudra has two natures, one wild and cruel (rudra), another that is kind and {{tranquil}} (shiva). The Vedic texts do not mention bull or any animal as the transport vehicle (vahana) of Rudra or other deities. However, post-Vedic texts {{such as the}} Mahabharata and the Puranas state the Nandi bull, the Indian zebu, in particular, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> of Rudra and of Shiva, thereby unmistakably linking them as same.|$|E

25|$|During {{a rocket}} launch, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> speed increases, and the {{atmosphere}} thins, {{there is a point}} of maximum aerodynamic drag called Max Q. This determines the minimum aerodynamic strength of the vehicle, as the rocket must avoid buckling under these forces.|$|E
30|$|Taking {{into account}} the {{transport}} demand and <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> stock in <b>the</b> previous period, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> that survived in current period, the demand for new <b>vehicles</b> and <b>the</b> average mileage per vehicle are calculated.|$|R

25|$|In Indian tradition, rats {{are seen}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> of Ganesha, and a rat's statue is always {{found in a}} temple of Ganesh. In the northwestern Indian city of Deshnoke, the rats at the Karni Mata Temple are held to be destined for reincarnation as Sadhus (Hindu holy men).

25|$|In the {{sympathetic}} magic common to prehistoric and primitive religions, the fat of sacrificial animals and persons is often reckoned {{as a powerful}} charm, second to blood <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> and seat of life. East African Arabs traditionally anointed themselves with lion's fat to gain courage and provoke fear in other animals. Australian Aborigines would rub themselves with a human victim's caul fat to gain his powers.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the 1900s, calliopes {{began using}} music rolls {{instead of a}} live musician. The music roll {{operated}} {{in a similar manner}} to a piano roll in a player piano, mechanically operating the keys. Many of these mechanical calliopes retained keyboards, allowing a live musician to play them if needed. During this period, compressed air began to replace steam <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> of producing sound.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the case}} of Ultra, the {{guideway}} can consist of as little as two parallel rows of concrete barriers, similar to the bumpers found in a parking lot. <b>The</b> <b>vehicle</b> uses them for fine guidance only; {{it is able to}} steer itself around curves by following the barriers passively. No [...] "switching" [...] is required on <b>the</b> track, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> can make their own turns between routes based on an internal map. Since <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> are battery-powered, {{there is no need for}} electrification along <b>the</b> track: <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> recharge when they are parked at the stations. As a result, the trackway is similar in complexity to a conventional road surface, a light-duty one <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> will not vary in weight to the extent of a tractor-trailer. Even the stations are greatly simplified; in {{the case of}} ground-level tracks, the lack of any substantial infrastructure means that <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> can stop at any kerb. Stations at Heathrow resemble a parking lot with diagonal slots, with a rain shield similar to the awnings at a gas station.|$|R
5000|$|Over-the-wall pit crews in NASCAR's three {{national}} series {{were able to}} hand push their car {{no more than three}} pit boxes away from their assigned pit box—limiting the crews to the same three-box length for pushing <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> could drive through getting onto pit road.|$|R
25|$|In another design, {{a rubber}} housing is {{fitted with a}} {{pressure}} relief valve that determines {{the speed of a}} vehicle. If the vehicle is traveling below the set speed, the valve opens allowing the bump to deflate <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> drives over it, but it remains closed if the vehicle is traveling too fast. The valve can also be set to allow heavy vehicles, such as fire trucks, ambulances, and buses to cross at higher speeds.|$|E
25|$|Some {{months before}} the murder spree, Suprunyuk — {{with the help of}} Sayenko and Hanzha — began picking up {{passengers}} and robbing them. A green Daewoo with a taxicab's checkerboard marking was often described <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> used in the murders. According to the suspects' confessions, some murder victims were picked up as passengers in the cab. Hanzha reportedly participated in one where two men were robbed, and then declined to take part in any further attacks.|$|E
25|$|When {{the flag}} is {{affixed to the}} right side of a vehicle of any kind (e.g.: cars, boats, planes, any {{physical}} object that moves), it should be oriented so that the canton is towards the front of the vehicle, as if the flag were streaming backwards from its hoist <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> moves forward. Therefore, U.S. flag decals on the right sides of vehicles may appear to be reversed, with the union to the observer's right instead of left as more commonly seen.|$|E
50|$|Mike and Sulley {{say goodbye}} to Boo <b>as</b> <b>the</b> taxis exit the door vault. CDA agents cleanse exiting riders as a {{cameraman}} films them. An audio-animatronics figure of Roz talks to the passing riders, often singling out riders by the row they're in <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> approach <b>the</b> unload area.|$|R
50|$|Weight {{transfer}} occurs <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> CoM shifts during automotive maneuvers. Acceleration {{causes the}} sprung mass to rotate about a geometric axis resulting in relocation of the CoM. Front-back weight transfer {{is proportional to}} the change in the longitudinal location of the CoM to <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> wheelbase, and side-to-side weight transfer (summed over front and rear) {{is proportional to the}} ratio of the change in the CoM's lateral location to <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> track.|$|R
5000|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{vehicles are}} often major culprits in such outbreaks, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> are often driven on back roads often overgrown with invasive plant species. The undercarriage of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> becomes a prime vessel of transport. In response, on large fires, washing stations [...] "decontaminate" [...] vehicles before engaging in suppression activities. Large wildfires attract firefighters from remote places, further increasing {{the potential for}} seed transport.|$|R
25|$|Minimalist {{composer}} Charlemagne Palestine chose a nine-foot Bösendorfer <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{on which}} to perform his 1974 composition Strumming Music. Released as his first compact disc in 1991, it features in excess of 45 minutes of Palestine forcefully playing two notes in rapid alternation, slowly expanding into clusters, with the sustain pedal depressed throughout. As the music swells (and the piano gradually detunes), the harmonics build and the listener can hear a variety of timbres rarely produced by the piano.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{than the}} {{mechanical}} linkages employed in earlier directional-headlamp systems, AFS relies on electronic sensors, transducers and actuators. Other AFS techniques include special auxiliary optical systems within a vehicle's headlamp housings. These auxiliary systems may be switched {{on and off}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> and operating conditions call for light or darkness at the angles covered by the beam the auxiliary optics produce. A typical system measures steering angle and vehicle speed to swivel the headlamps. The most advanced AFS systems use GPS signals to anticipate changes in road curvature, rather than simply reacting to them.|$|E
25|$|On 24 November 1989, Muhammad Azzam {{was driving}} {{his father and}} brother to Friday prayers in Peshawar, when unknown assassins detonated a bomb <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> approached. Lying in a narrow street across from a gas station, the {{explosive}} had a 50-metre detonation cord {{which led to the}} sewerage system where the assailant presumably waited. According to Time magazine, Waheed Muzhda had noticed what he assumed was a crew doing routine road maintenance working on the culvert where the bomb was placed, the day before the assassination. Azzam and his sons were buried near the same site as his mother the year before, the Pabi Graveyard of the Shuhadaa' (martyrs), in Peshawar.|$|E

50|$|The third {{generation}} Saturn S-Series {{was also the}} first Saturn to use the Body Control Module (BCM), and the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) systems in tandem with each other. In the {{third generation}} Saturn S-Series models, the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) system was only used strictly for <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> transmission system <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> engine, whereas <b>the</b> Body Control Module (BCM) system was only used strictly for <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> interior functions like the digital trip odometer, <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> speedometer, and other electronic functions in <b>the</b> <b>vehicle's</b> interior <b>as</b> well.|$|R
