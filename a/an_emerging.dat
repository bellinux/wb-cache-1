Bluetongue disease, a disease caused by an orbivirus broke out in sheep in France in 2007.

5|$|The {{decline and}} fall of Pedro II of Brazil {{occurred}} {{over the course of}} the 1880s, with the underlying factors accumulating and coming increasingly into focus after 1881.

5|$|The play {{deals with}} {{relations}} between Native Americans {{and the first}} European settlers in America. Scholars have debated whether the piece is progressive in its depiction of the natives and have commented that the work reflects <b>an</b> <b>emerging</b> American dramatic and musical sensibility.

5|$|Wollstonecraft later repudiated Mary, {{writing that}} it was laughable. However, {{scholars}} have argued that, despite its faults, the novel's representation of an energetic, unconventional, opinionated, rational, female genius (the {{first of its kind}} in English literature) within a new kind of romance is an important development {{in the history of the}} novel because it helped shape <b>an</b> <b>emerging</b> feminist discourse.|$|E
5|$|Cancer is {{a change}} in the {{cellular}} processes that cause a tumour to grow out of control. Cancerous cells sometimes have mutations in oncogenes, such as KRAS and CTNNB1 (Î²-catenin). Analysing the molecular signature of cancerous cellsthe DNA and its levels of expression via messenger RNAenables physicians to characterise the cancer and to choose the best therapy for their patients. As of 2010, assays that incorporate an array of antibodies against specific protein marker molecules are <b>an</b> <b>emerging</b> technology; there are hopes for these multiplex assays that could measure many markers at once. Other potential future biomarkers include micro RNA molecules, which cancerous cells express more of than healthy ones.|$|E

5|$|Even if {{an ancient}} and {{advanced}} extraterrestrial civilization wished to help humanity, humans could {{suffer from a}} loss of identity and confidence due to the technological and cultural prowess of the extraterrestrial civilization. However, a friendly civilization may calibrate its contact with humanity {{in such a way}} as to minimize unintended consequences. Michael A. G. Michaud suggests that a friendly and advanced extraterrestrial civilization may even avoid all contact with <b>an</b> <b>emerging</b> intelligent species like humanity, to ensure that the less advanced civilization can develop naturally at its own pace; this is known as the zoo hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Floatovoltaics are <b>an</b> <b>emerging</b> form of PV {{systems that}} float {{on the surface}} of {{irrigation}} canals, water reservoirs, quarry lakes, and tailing ponds. Several systems exist in France, India, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. These systems reduce the need of valuable land area, save drinking water that would otherwise be lost through evaporation, and show a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion, as the panels are kept at a cooler temperature than they would be on land. Although not floating, other dual-use facilities with solar power include fisheries.|$|E
5|$|Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, near Dania Beach, Florida, is the city's main {{airport and}} is the {{fastest-growing}} major airport in the country. This is, in part, attributable to service by low-cost carriers such as Spirit Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and Virgin America, resulting in lower airfares than nearby Miami International Airport. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood is <b>an</b> <b>emerging</b> international gateway for the Caribbean and Latin America. Miami International Airport and Palm Beach International Airport also serve the city.|$|E

5|$|Frogs {{are valued}} as food by humans and also have many {{cultural}} roles in literature, symbolism and religion. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than {{one third of}} species {{are considered to be}} threatened with extinction and over one hundred and twenty are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and <b>an</b> <b>emerging</b> fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world. Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational-wave {{astronomy}} is <b>an</b> <b>emerging</b> {{field of}} astronomy that employs gravitational-wave detectors to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, {{such as the}} Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory LIGO. LIGO made its first detection on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a binary black hole. A second gravitational wave was detected on 26 December 2015 and additional observations should continue but gravitational waves require extremely sensitive instruments.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 American film {{directors}} Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel released New World Order, {{a critically}} acclaimed documentary film which explores {{the world of}} conspiracy theorists - such as American radio host Alex Jones - who consistently expose and vigorously oppose {{what they perceive as}} <b>an</b> <b>emerging</b> New World Order. The growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has also created an alliance between right-wing populist agitators (such as Alex Jones) and hip hop music's left-wing populist rappers (such as KRS-One, Professor Griff of Public Enemy and Immortal Technique), thus illustrating how anti-elitist conspiracism can create unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose a political system.|$|E

5|$|In Original Stories, Wollstonecraft {{employed}} the then-burgeoning genre of children's literature {{to promote the}} education of women and <b>an</b> <b>emerging</b> middle-class ideology. She argued that women {{would be able to}} become rational adults if they were educated properly as children, which was not a widely held belief in the 18th century, and contended that the nascent middle-class ethos was superior to the court culture represented by fairy tales and to the values of chance and luck found in chapbook stories for the poor. Wollstonecraft, in developing her own pedagogy, also responded to the works of the two most important educational theorists of the 18th century: John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to planned increases in large-scale generating capacity and microsystems using renewable sources, various related schemes to reduce carbon emissions are being researched. Although {{there is significant}} support from the public, private and community-led sectors, concerns {{about the effect of}} the technologies on the natural environment have been expressed. There is also <b>an</b> <b>emerging</b> political debate about the relationship between the siting, and the ownership and control of these widely distributed resources.|$|E
5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes <b>an</b> <b>emerging</b> middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Driven by an Enlightenment belief in progress, she derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family has a farm sufficient for its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she claims is genuine feeling, with Burke's false theatrical tableaux.|$|E
