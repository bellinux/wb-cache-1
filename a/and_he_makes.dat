5|$|Six months later, King Stewart {{learns that}} Redbush is gone <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> {{his way to}} Quahog to reclaim his wife and kill Griffin Peterson. King Stewart's army arrives in Quahog where they terrorize the colony (similar to a scene from Blazing Saddles). King Stewart orders Cockney First Lieutenant (Chris) to search every house for them. Upon being {{discovered}} by the First Lieutenant, Griffin Peterson and Lady Redbush are confronted by King Stewart. Griffin Peterson threatens to kill the officer, while King Stewart threatens to kill Redbush. After exchanging threats without getting anywhere, Griffin and Stewart decide to settle their dispute with a talent show, with the winner winning Lady Redbush's hand in marriage, and ownership {{of the town of}} Quahog. For his act, King Stewart steals his jester's mostly unfunny jokes about his Aunt Frieda. However, Griffin, Quagmire, Joe, Cleveland, Mort, and Seamus effectively steal the show with a techno-rock number from Revenge of the Nerds. This was enough to defeat King Stewart in the talent show. After King Stewart and his army leaves, Griffin and Redbush remain in Quahog to live happily ever after.|$|E

Radiaro and Calafia issue a challenge to two Christian warriors to engage them in single combat for the purpose of deciding the battle. King Amadis and his son Esplandián accept the challenge. The black-skinned warrior woman chosen as messenger tells Calafia that Esplandián is the most handsome and elegant man that has ever existed. Calafia determines that she must see the man herself before engaging him in combat. She stays awake all night wondering whether to wear royal robes or warrior's armor. Deciding in favor of a thick golden toga embroidered with jewels, topped by a golden hood, she rode to meet her enemies, escorted by 2,000 women warriors. After being seated among the Christian kings, she immediately recognized Esplandián from his great beauty, {{and fell in love with}} him. She tells him she will meet him on the field of battle and, if they should live, that she wishes to speak further with him. Esplandián considers Calafia an infidel, an abomination of the rightfully subservient position of woman in relation to man, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> no response.|$|E

25|$|According to Roubi, {{the final}} two {{chapters}} of the Arabic theological novel Fādil ibn Nātiq (c. 1270), also known as Theologus Autodidactus, by the Arabian polymath writer Ibn al-Nafis (12131288) {{can be described as}} science fiction. The theological novel deals with various science fiction elements such as spontaneous generation, futurology, apocalyptic themes, eschatology, resurrection and the afterlife, but rather than giving supernatural or mythological explanations for these events, Ibn al-Nafis attempted to explain these plot elements using his own extensive scientific knowledge in anatomy, biology, physiology, astronomy, cosmology and geology. For example, it was through this novel that Ibn al-Nafis introduces his scientific theory of metabolism, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> references to his own scientific discovery of the pulmonary circulation in order to explain bodily resurrection. The novel was later translated into English as Theologus Autodidactus in the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The two icons {{on either}} side of the Royal Doors are rather similar: Jesus was painted with an orb in his left hand, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> the same gesture with his right in both pictures. However, the icon of the Theotokos {{represents}} Jesus' first appearance among humans, while the Pantocrator icon refers to his second coming. Thus the royal gate– and with that the most important movements of the holy service– is situated between the first and the second coming of Jesus. There is another interesting relationship between the two paintings. In Byzantine iconography Mary and Jesus usually wear blue or white garments covered by a red toga. After the death of Christ the colors are inverted. This change appears on the Theotokos and the Pantocrator icons: Mary wears a white tunic with a red toga; the Pantocrator on the other side wears a red garment with a blue toga. The Virgin also wears a blue on red garment on the top of the iconostasis, when mourning her son's death. In Christian art, the combination of blue and red has further significance: red refers to the divine origin and blue symbolizes human nature. This is the reason Christian art so often depicts Jesus in red and blue garments.|$|E

This confuses Mick, and he concludes that it was Stan who tried to kill him and attacks him, prompting Shirley {{to admit that she}} had attempted to drown him. Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) finds out from Shirley that Mick is actually her son, his father is a man named Andy and her mother Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) concealed the pregnancy and brought Mick up as her and Stan's son. Shirley warns Phil not to tell Mick. Despite not being able to swim and having a phobia of water, Mick signs up to a sponsored swim in aid of his friend Billy Mitchell's (Perry Fenwick) young daughter, Janet Mitchell (Grace), who has Down's syndrome. He starts to learn at the local swimming pool, and confesses his fear to his friend, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Ian helps him overcome this fear <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> progress. Linda tells Mick she wants another baby after she realises her children are too old to require her constant attention. Mick convinces Linda {{that this is not a}} good idea, but proposes to her, as they are not actually married, though their families think they are.

25|$|The 19th century Italian writer Arturo Graf {{gives this}} version of the legend in his 1889 book Il Diavolo : There was once a duchess of Normandy who was tormented with a desire to have {{children}} and yet could have none. Weary of recommending herself to God, who will not listen to her, she betakes herself to the Devil, and her wish is speedily satisfied. A son is born to her, a veritable firebrand. As an infant, he bites his nurse and tears out her hair; as a lad, he knifes his teachers; at the age of twenty, he becomes a bandit chief. He is dubbed knight, in the belief that thus the wicked instincts raging within him may be overcome; but thereafter he is worse than he was before. No one surpasses him in strength or in courage. In a tourney he overthrows and slays thirty opponents; then he goes roaming about the world; then he returns to his native land, and begins once more to play the bandit, robbing, burning, murdering, ravishing. One day, after cutting the throats of all the nuns of a certain abbey, he remembers his mother and goes in search of her. Soon as they spy him, the servants take to their heels, scattering in all directions; not one tarries to ask him whence he comes or what he desires. Then, {{for the first time in}} his life, Robert is astounded at the horror which he inspires in his fellow-beings; for the first time, he becomes conscious of his own monstrous wickedness, and he feels how his heart is pierced by the sharp tooth of remorse. But why is he wickeder than other men? Why was he born thus? Who made him what he is? An ardent longing seizes him to unravel this mystery. He hastens to his mother, and with drawn sword he adjures her to unveil to him the secret of his birth. Learning this, he becomes frantic with terror, shame, and grief. But his sturdy nature is not weakened; he does not yield to despair; instead, the hope of a laborious redemption, of a marvelous victory, urges and spurs on his proud spirit. He will learn to conquer Hell, to subdue himself, to thwart the designs of that accursed fiend who created him to serve his own ends, who has made of him a docile instrument of destruction and of sin. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> no delay. He goes to Rome, casts himself at the feet of the pope, makes confession to a holy hermit, submits himself to the harshest kind of penance, and swears that henceforth he will taste no food that he has not first wrested from the jaws of a dog. On two separate occasions, when Rome was besieged by the Saracens, he fights incognito for the Emperor and gains the victory for the Christians. Recognized at last, he refuses all rewards and honors, the imperial crown, even the monarch's own daughter, goes away to dwell with his hermit in the wilderness, and dies a saint, blessed by both God and men. In other accounts, he finally weds the beautiful princess who is deeply in love with him.|$|E
