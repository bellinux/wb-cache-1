5|$|Which {{part of the}} {{electromagnetic}} spectrum—the visible, near-infrared (NIR) or mid-infrared (MIR)—produces the most accurate <b>angular</b> <b>measurement</b> is still debated. In 1996, Betelgeuse was shown to have a uniform disk of 56.6 ± 1.0mas. In 2000, the SSL team produced another measure of 54.7 ± 0.3mas, ignoring any possible contribution from hotspots, which are less noticeable in the mid-infrared. Also included was a theoretical allowance for limb darkening, yielding a diameter of 55.2 ± 0.5mas. The earlier estimate equates to a radius of roughly 5.6AU or , assuming the 2008 Harper distance of 197.0 ± 45pc, a figure {{roughly the size of}} the Jovian orbit of 5.5AU, published in 2009 in Astronomy Magazine and a year later in NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day.|$|E
5|$|Central to this discussion, it was {{announced}} in 2009, that the radius of Betelgeuse had shrunk from 1993 to 2009 by 15%, with the 2008 <b>angular</b> <b>measurement</b> equal to 47.0mas, {{not too far from}} Perrin's estimate. Unlike most earlier papers, this study encompassed a 15-year period at one specific wavelength. Earlier studies have typically lasted one to two years by comparison and have explored multiple wavelengths, often yielding vastly different results. The diminution in Betelgeuse's apparent size equates to a range of values between 56.0±0.1mas seen in 1993 to 47.0±0.1mas seen in 2008—a contraction of almost 0.9AU in 15years. What is not fully known is whether this observation is evidence of a rhythmic expansion and contraction of the star's photosphere as astronomers have theorized, and if so, what the periodic cycle might be, although Townes suggested that if a cycle does exist, it is probably a few decades long. Other possible explanations are photospheric protrusions due to convection or a star that is not spherical but asymmetric causing the appearance of expansion and contraction as the star rotates on its axis.|$|E

60|$|The plain marked 355 feet (as ascertained by the {{barometer}} and by <b>angular</b> <b>measurement)</b> is {{a continuation}} of the above-mentioned 330 feet plain: it extends in a N.W. direction along the southern shores of the estuary. It is capped by gravel, which in most parts is covered by a thin bed of sandy earth, and is scooped out by many flat-bottomed valleys. It appears to the eye quite level, but in proceeding in a S.S.W. course, towards an escarpment distant about six miles, and likewise ranging across the country in a N.W. line, it was found to rise at first insensibly, and then for the last half-mile, sensibly, close up {{to the base of the}} escarpment: at this point it was 463 feet in height, showing a rise of 108 feet in the six miles. On this 355-463 feet plain, I found several shells of Mytilus Magellanicus and of a Mytilus, which Mr. Sowerby informs me is yet unnamed, though well-known as recent on this coast; Patella deaurita; Fusus, I believe, Magellanicus, but the specimen has been lost; and at the distance of four miles from the coast, at the height of about four hundred feet, there were fragments of the same Patella and of a Voluta (apparently V. ancilla) partially embedded in the superficial sandy earth. All these shells had the same ancient appearance with those from the foregoing localities. As the tides along this part of the coast rise at the Syzygal period forty feet, and therefore form a well-marked beach-line, I particularly looked out for ridges in crossing this plain, which, as we have seen, rises 108 feet in about six miles, but I could not see any traces of such. The next highest plain is 710 feet above the sea; it is very narrow, but level, and is capped with gravel; it abuts to the foot of the 840 feet plain. This summit-plain extends as far as the eye can range, both inland along the southern side of the valley of the Santa Cruz, and southward along the Atlantic.|$|E

60|$|The coast {{as far as}} Bahia Blanca (in {{latitude}} 39 degrees S.) {{is formed}} either of a horizontal range of cliffs, or of immense accumulations of sand-dunes. Within Bahia Blanca, {{a small piece of}} tableland, about twenty feet above high-water mark, called Punta Alta, is formed of strata of cemented gravel and of red earthy mud, abounding with shells (with others lying loose on the surface), and the bones of extinct mammifers. These shells, twenty in number, together with a Balanus and two corals, are all recent species, still inhabiting the neighbouring seas. They will be enumerated in the Fourth Chapter, when describing the Pampean formation; five of them are identical with the upraised ones from near Buenos Ayres. The northern shore of Bahia Blanca is, in main part, formed of immense sand-dunes, resting on gravel with recent shells, and ranging in lines parallel to the shore. These ranges are separated from each other by flat spaces, composed of stiff impure red clay, in which, at the distance of about two miles from the coast, I found by digging a few minute fragments of sea-shells. The sand-dunes extend several miles inland, and stand on a plain, which slopes up to a height of between one hundred and two hundred feet. Numerous, small, well-rounded pebbles of pumice lie scattered both on the plain and sand-hillocks: at Monte Hermoso, on the flat summit of a cliff, I found many of them at a height of 120 feet (<b>angular</b> <b>measurement)</b> above the level of the sea. These pumice pebbles, no doubt, were originally brought down from the Cordillera by the rivers which cross the continent, {{in the same way as}} the river Negro anciently brought down, and still brings down, pumice, and as the river Chupat brings down scoriae: when once delivered at the mouth of a river, they would naturally have travelled along the coasts, and been cast up during the elevation of the land, at different heights. The origin of the argillaceous flats, which separate the parallel ranges of sand-dunes, seems due to the tides here having a tendency (as I believe they have on most shoal, protected coasts) to throw up a bar parallel to the shore, and at some distance from it; this bar gradually becomes larger, affording a base for the accumulation of sand- dunes, and the shallow space within then becomes silted up with mud. The repetition of this process, without any elevation of the land, would form a level plain traversed by parallel lines of sand-hillocks; during a slow elevation of the land, the hillocks would rest on a gently inclined surface, like that on the northern shore of Bahia Blanca. I did not observe any shells in this neighbourhood at a greater height than twenty feet; and therefore the age of the sea-drifted pebbles of pumice, now standing at the height of 120 feet, must remain uncertain.|$|E

Materials and Methods: In this study, the mesiodistal width and height as well as the <b>angular</b> <b>measurements</b> were ascertained in four different sites of the mandibular and maxillary jaws (anterior, canine, premolar, and molar regions). Each area was outlined by gutta-percha as opaque markers. The measurements were obtained by a digital caliper (as gold standard) and on CBCT views including “three-dimensional” and “panaroma” (section thickness of 5 and 10 [*]mm). Data were analyzed by the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: The means [standard deviation (SD) ] of measurement accuracy of all groups were more than 90 %. There was no significant difference between the means (SD) of measurement accuracy of all views (oneway ANOVA, P[*]>[*] 0. 05). The means (SD) of measurement accuracy of all views in four regions of the jaws had no significant difference (one-way ANOVA, P[*]>[*] 0. 05). Conclusion: This study showed that CBCT imaging has a high degree of measurement accuracy in all three horizontal, vertical, and <b>angular</b> <b>measurements</b> as well as the “panorama” (5 - and 10 -mm thicknesses) and “three-dimensional” views in all the areas of the jaws.
