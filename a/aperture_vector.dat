40|$|We propose an {{innovative}} {{design for a}} vector magnet compatible with neutron scattering experiments. This would vastly expand the range of experimental possibilities since applying a magnetic field and orienting the sample in diffraction conditions will become completely independent. This Wide <b>Aperture</b> <b>VEctor</b> magnet is a setup made of 16 coils, all with a vertical axis. The vertical component of the field is produced by two pairs of coaxial coils carrying opposite currents for an active shielding of the stray field, while the horizontal components are generated by 3 sets of 4 coils each, two above and two below the diffraction plane. This innovative geometry allows a very wide aperture (220 ^∘ horizontal, ± 10 ^∘ vertical), which is crucial for neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering experiments. Moreover, the homogeneity of the field is far better than in the usual vertical coils, and {{the diameter of the}} sample bore is unusually large (10 cm). The concept has been developed so as {{to be used as a}} sample environment on every LLB instrument relevant for magnetism studies.

40|$|Plenoptic {{cameras and}} Shack-Hartmann {{wavefront}} sensors are lenslet-based optical systems {{that do not}} form a conventional image. The addition of a lens array into these systems allows for the aberrations generated by {{the combination of the}} object and the optical components located prior to the lens array to be measured or corrected with post-processing. This dissertation provides a ray selection method to determine the rays that pass through each lenslet in a lenslet-based system. This first-order, ray trace method is developed for any lenslet-based system with a well-defined fore optic, where in this dissertation the fore optic is all of the optical components located prior to the lens array. For example, in a plenoptic camera the fore optic is a standard camera lens. Because a lens array at any location after the exit pupil of the fore optic is considered in this analysis, it is applicable to both plenoptic cameras and Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors. Only a generic, unaberrated fore optic is considered, but this dissertation establishes a framework for considering the effect of an aberrated fore optic in lenslet-based systems. The rays from the fore optic that pass through a lenslet placed at any location after the fore optic are determined. This collection of rays is reduced to three rays that describe the entire lenslet ray set. The lenslet ray set is determined at the object, image, and pupil planes of the fore optic. The consideration of the apertures that define the lenslet ray set for an on-axis lenslet leads to three classes of lenslet-based systems. Vignetting of the lenslet rays is considered for off-axis lenslets. Finally, the lenslet ray set is normalized into terms similar to the field and <b>aperture</b> <b>vector</b> used to describe the aberrated wavefront of the fore optic. The analysis in this dissertation is complementary to other first-order models that have been developed for a specific plenoptic camera layout or Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor application. This general analysis determines the location where the rays of each lenslet pass through the fore optic establishing a framework to consider the effect of an aberrated fore optic in a future analysis...|$|E

The crucial advantage of vector sensors relative to hydrophones is that they are able to record both the omni-directional pressure and the three vectorial components of the particle velocity. A claimed advantage of vector sensors over hydrophones is the quantity of information obtained from a single point spatial device, which potentially allows for high performance small <b>aperture</b> <b>Vector</b> Sensor Arrays (VSA). The capabilities of such small aperture VSA have captured the attention for their usage in high-frequency applications. The main contribution of this work is the understanding of the gain provided by vector sensors over hydrophones whenever ocean environmental parameter estimation is concerned. In a rst step a particle velocity-pressure joint data model is proposed and an extended VSA-based Bartlett estimator is derived. This data model and estimator, initially developed for estimating direction of arrival, are generalized for ocean parameter estimation, assuming a particle velocity capable physical model - the TRACEO model. The highlighted capabilities of the VSA are rst demonstrated for angle of arrival estimation, where a variety of spatial con gurations of hydrophone arrays are compared to that of a vertical VSA. A vertical VSA array con guration is then used for estimating geoacoustic bottom properties from short range acoustic data, using two VSA-based techniques: the generalized Bartlett estimator and the re ection coe cient estimator proposed by Harrison et al [...] The proposed techniques where tested on experimental VSA data recorded in shallow water area o the Island of Kauai (Hawaii) during the MakaiEx 2005 experiment. The obtained results are comparable between techniques and inline with the expected values for that region. These results suggest that it is indeed possible to obtain reliable seabed geoacoustic properties' estimates in a frequency band of 8 - 14 kHz using a small aperture VSA with only a few sensors.
