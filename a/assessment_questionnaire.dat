50|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} the HRA {{can be traced back}} to the decision by the assistant Surgeon General of the United States to conduct a study to determine probable 10-year lifespan of individuals based on lifestyles and predisposed conditions. The project, led by Lewis C. Robbins, MD, of the Public Health Service, was the Framingham study. The study was based on in-depth longitudinal studies of 5,000 families in Framingham, Massachusetts, that continues to this day under funding from the National Institutes of Health.Dr. Robbins left the Public Health Service and joined Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis where, working with Jack Hall, MD, he developed the first set of health hazard tables. This culminated in the publication of How to Practice Prospective Medicine in 1970 - a guide for practising physicians, which outlined the health risk <b>assessment</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> risk computations and patient feedback strategies. It wasn't until 1980, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a publicly available version, that the HRA became widely used, particularly in workplace settings.Health & Welfare Canada reviewed How to Practice Prospective Medicine and created a mainframe version of the book. The Centers for Disease Control became aware of this product and adapted it to the newly available personal computer. When Prudential Life Insurance also took an interest and asked to fund an update of the program, the CDC, which could not accept private project funding at the time, transferred ownership to the Carter Center at Emory University where it was updated from 1986-7. The transfer and subsequent program were managed by Dr. Ed Hutchins who had worked on the HRA in positions at the University of Pennsylvania and Charlotte-Mecklenberg Hospital. At Charlotte Mecklenberg, he secured a contract with the World Health Organization to create a mainframe product that could be used on an international basis.The HRA was managed as a not-for-profit product. Copies were distributed to every state health department and liaisons were assigned to each to work with their staffs to evaluate related data. Over 2,000 copies of the software were distributed to users who requested it and approximately 70 copies of the code were provided to for-profit companies that were interested in developing proprietary products. This proliferation coincided with the rapid growth in interest in corporate health promotion programs as awareness developed on health risks and for-profit vendors monetized the programs.The Carter Center's interest shifted to Africa and Dr. Hutchins founded the Healthier People Network (HPN) which in 1991 to continue the work. HPN raised funds to support the HRA but additional funding was not forthcoming from government sources. As a result, the Carter Center and HPN could not underwrite basic supporting activities such as annual conferences and, over time, the State-based liaison network and associated intellectual capital atrophied as programs lost funding and liaisons moved on.The use of HRAs and corporate wellness programs has been most prevalent in the United States, with comparatively slower growth elsewhere. However, there has been recent strong growth in corporate wellness outside the US, particularly in Europe and Asia.|$|E

40|$|The primary aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{medication}} knowledge of hemodialysis patients and to evaluate the impact of education on their medication knowledge. This was a prospective randomised study, conducted in two phases. Study population consisted of 90 hemodialysis patients, randomised into two groups. Baseline medication knowledge of these patients was assessed using medication knowledge <b>assessment</b> <b>questionnaire</b> developed for the study. During the first phase of the study, group I patients received the education provided by a trained clinical pharmacist regarding their medications for eight-weeks and group II patients were deprived of clinical pharmacist provided education but received services only by usual healthcare group. At the end of week eight, medication knowledge <b>assessment</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was applied to both the groups of patients. In the second phase, group I patients were deprived of clinical pharmacist education and group II patients were rendered with clinical pharmacist provided education for eight-weeks and medication knowledge <b>assessment</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was once again administered to both the groups at the end of week 16. At the end of week eight, there was a statistically significant (P 0. 05) improvement in the medication knowledge <b>assessment</b> <b>questionnaire</b> scores observed in group I, compared to baseline medication knowledge <b>assessment</b> <b>questionnaire</b> scores and week eight scores of group II patients. There was no significant (P > 0. 05) improvement observed in scores of group II compared to baseline. At the end of week 16 of the study period, there was a statistically significant (P 0. 05) improvement in the medication knowledge <b>assessment</b> <b>questionnaire</b> scores of the group II patients compared to their baseline and week eight scores. At the end of week 16 there was a significant (P 0. 05) drop in the medication knowledge <b>assessment</b> <b>questionnaire</b> scores of group I patients compared to their week nine scores. The study confirms that medication knowledge of the hemodialysis patients was extremely poor regarding the name, indication and dosage regimen of their medications.
