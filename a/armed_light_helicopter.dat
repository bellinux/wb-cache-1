50|$|A {{significant}} number of SA 315B Lamas were manufactured under license in India by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), under the name Cheetah. More than three decades after production in India began, HAL was still receiving export orders for the original Cheetah. Along with the Alouette III, the Cheetah was a key product for HAL; experience from manufacturing the type aided in the later development of more advanced indigenous helicopters such as the HAL Dhruv. During the 1990s, HAL developed an <b>armed</b> <b>light</b> attack <b>helicopter</b> based upon the Cheetah, which was given the name Lancer.|$|R
2500|$|In 2015, Airbus Helicopters and Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) {{formed an}} {{agreement}} to transfer principle manufacturing activity for the EC155 to South Korea; KAI shall become the sole manufacturer of the type after 2018, and both firms shall be jointly involved in the international marketing and further development of the type. The EC155 is {{to serve as the}} basis for KAI's <b>Light</b> Civil <b>Helicopter</b> (LCH) and <b>Light</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (LAH), featuring numerous changes including a new cockpit, improved gearbox and rotor blades; the LAH shall have a chin-mounted 20mm cannon and side-mounted guided rockets, countermeasures systems, and be able to carry 6–10 combat troops. The LCH is to enter service in 2020, and the LAH will follow in 2022 to replace the MD 500 Defender and AH-1J/S Cobra. Airbus foresees a South Korean demand for 100 LCHs and 214 LAHs, and estimates an international market of 300–400 LAH versions to replace legacy attack helicopters. Hanwha Techwin has been developing the TAipers (Tank Sniper) <b>Light</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Helicopter</b> Air-to-Ground Missile (LAH-AGM) as the primary anti-tank missile for the LAH since 2015. [...] Weighing [...] and guided by a dual CCD TV and imaging infrared (IIR) seeker delivering a fire-and-forget capability as well as a fire, observe, and update mode using a fiber-optic data-link, up to two twin-tube launchers can be outfitted on either side of the fuselage providing an anti-armor capability up to [...] away. [...] Work is expected to be completed by the end of 2022 with serial production to commence in 2023, coinciding with the introduction of the LAH into ROK service.|$|R
