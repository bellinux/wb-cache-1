50|$|Scania {{was late}} in {{providing}} a <b>low-floor</b> <b>double-deck</b> <b>vehicle,</b> for some years prior having only offered the L94UB with a Wright Solar body to UK operators. Prior to the OmniDekka’s conception, Wrightbus had attempted to mount their Gemini double-decker body on Scania's N94UD chassis, but this was unsuccessful.|$|R
50|$|Further {{expansion}} came in January 2009, {{when the}} shuttle service between Didcot Parkway station and Milton Park was expanded from one bus to two {{using a new}} <b>low-floor</b> <b>double-deck</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{at a cost of}} £175,000. Over 400 passes for the service were issued to workers prior to its introduction. In November 2009 a Courtney Coaches driver ejected a woman from a bus following a complaint from another passenger because of fears over swine flu.|$|R
40|$|To {{optimize}} the {{energy efficiency and}} to reduce the CO 2 -emissions in the railway transport area new vehicle concepts are needed. Regarding the drive concept for high-speed trains the question of using wheel hub motors always comes back into the discussion. Especially for <b>low-floor</b> <b>vehicles</b> or <b>double-deck</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{it is likely to}} use the space, which is now taken by the chassis, {{to use it as a}} walk-through area. The distribution of the drive power between several axes represents another advantage. In this paper basic considerations for the design of wheel hub motors for high speed trains with electrically excited synchronous machines are carried out...|$|R

50|$|In 1999, route 50 {{became the}} first Travel West Midlands route to be {{operated}} using <b>low-floor</b> <b>double-deck</b> buses. The Optare Spectra buses bought specifically for the route were replaced by Alexander ALX400 bodied Volvo B7TLs in February 2001. It celebrated its 50th anniversary later in the same year.|$|R
50|$|The route {{along which}} the 43 {{operates}} was designated as London's first Red Route bus priority scheme in 1992.

5000|$|... 2000 saw a {{decision}} to return to double deck buses and several <b>low-floor</b> <b>double-deck</b> buses were acquired. After an unsuccessful trial of powering a Metrorider by gas in 1995, a further attempt took place on an Optare Solo in 2005. The bus was not used frequently until 2007, when {{it was decided to}} convert the bus back to diesel.|$|R

50|$|Although {{originally}} {{design as}} a <b>double-deck</b> <b>vehicle,</b> a single deck version entered service in 1925. The initial batch of 24 (K1078 - K1101) entered service in August 1925 with 24-seat bodies on new chassis. These {{were the first}} vehicles to use pneumatic tyres in London. Subsequent batches of single-deck K-types used new bodies on the chassis of older <b>double-deck</b> <b>vehicles</b> from which the body had been removed. Conversely, future orders of the new single-deck chassis received double-deck bodywork.|$|R

5000|$|Articulated buses {{became popular}} in {{mainland}} Europe {{due to their}} increased capacity compared with regular buses. In many cities, lower railway bridge clearances have precluded the use of <b>double-deck</b> <b>vehicles,</b> which have never achieved great popularity there. Overhead wires for trams, trolleybuses etc. are not really relevant issues, as the minimum normal clearance above road level is standard across the EU and is well {{in excess of the}} height of a <b>double-deck</b> <b>vehicle.</b> (Otherwise many freight vehicles would encounter severe problems in the course of normal operation.) ...|$|R

Also in 2006 the Tourismo was redeveloped, and a 14-metre version was presented.

50|$|The {{majority}} of Glasgow's trolleybuses were <b>double-deck</b> <b>vehicles,</b> painted in Glasgow Corporation's orange, green and cream livery (though {{in a different}} style from the buses and trams). The destination blinds on the trolleybuses used white letters on a green background (unlike the trams and buses, with more conventional white lettering on a black background).|$|R
50|$|On {{the request}} of the Victorian {{transport}} minister, who wished the last of the B-class order to be <b>low-floor</b> trams, an <b>articulated</b> <b>low-floor</b> design was developed by Comeng from 1989. The tram was to ostensibly utilise the components from the B-class and be partially low-floor, with internal stairs over the bogies. The design progressed quite far, with concept art, design schematics, and a mock up produced, and work on the first body shell commenced.|$|R
50|$|In February 2011, Transport for London {{confirmed}} that the route would be converted to <b>double-deck</b> <b>vehicles</b> in December 2011, and that {{the frequency of the}} route would be increased. Similar changes were planned for night bus variant N207. The proposals were criticised by local Liberal Democrat politicians for failing to increase the seating capacity of the route while increasing the number of vehicles on the Uxbridge Road.|$|R
50|$|In 1975 {{the company}} collaborated with Foden, a {{well-known}} manufacturer of commercial vehicles, {{to produce a}} semi-integral <b>double-deck</b> <b>vehicle</b> intended to compete with chassis manufacturer Leyland. Leyland had merged with traditional rival Daimler and was experiencing production and quality problems. In the event, only seven Foden NCs were produced, going to Greater Manchester PTE, West Midlands PTE, West Yorkshire PTE, Derby City Transport and Potteries Motor Traction.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the Combino, the Combino Supra is {{designed}} in 9 m fixed sections. Each section has a bogie, either powered or unpowered. The length can be anywhere from two sections (18 m) to eight (72 m). In Budapest and Almad, modules are in two-car blocks, each {{connected by a}} double articulation joint. In the Combino and other <b>articulated</b> <b>low-floor</b> trams, the modules are suspended between the bogies. Siemens claims the axle load is 10 t for a width of 2.65 m, such as the Almada.|$|R
