This temple has a unique feature: a small Surya (Sun) shrine faces the main shrine on the west. There is a common platform between both, which must have been an open mandapa originally. Hence, the Kashivisvanatha Temple has an entrance on the east side and south side of the mandapa. The entrance doorway and the towers are covered with close intricate carvings. The shikhara (dome) is in the North-Indian style <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a lathe must have been used to make the complex circular pillars.|$|E

500|$|The group's {{members were}} {{dissatisfied}} {{with the release of}} [...] "Soul Sound" [...] as a single, because they wanted to venture into an R sound whereas their record label London Records pushed them into a more pop direction. Soon after the song's release, Donaghy left the group and was replaced by former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range, making it the last Sugababes single to feature her vocals. Further, the sales of One Touch and its last three singles, [...] "New Year", [...] "Run for Cover" [...] and [...] "Soul Sound", failed to meet the expectations of London Records and the group was subsequently dropped. Band member Keisha Buchanan has stated that the song's release and subsequent commercial underperformance was a positive experience because, saying: [...] "Everything happens for a reason <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> it has all worked out".

It was the fifth of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire. Elba {{said he did not}} watch the episode after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so I try not to torture myself." [...] Rainn Wilson said he liked the episode because it demonstrated growth for his character and the relationship between Michael and Dwight; he said [...] "I like the way they let characters grow and change on the show," [...] and said of his character, [...] "It's not the same acolyte ass kissing as season 2". Wilson said the moment Dwight spun around the HarperCollins secretary saying [...] "Spin move", which was included in the script, {{was one of the most}} popular moments of the episode among the writers. Wilson said of filming the move, [...] "We did like five spin moves and once I did a somersault. I thought I was being all nimble and quick, but no.

500|$|During pre-season, {{ahead of}} the 2006–07 campaign, May injured his {{shoulder}} in training, resulting in him missing the club's pre-season tour of Iceland. Millwall manager Nigel Spackman revealed that May's injury would rule {{him out of the}} first two months of the season — [...] "He fell over during the close season, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> {{he is going to be}} out for a couple of months". He made his first appearance of the season in October 2006, coming on as a second-half substitute in Millwall's 2–0 home win against Bournemouth in the Football League Trophy, scoring Millwall's second goal with his first touch of the game. In his first start of the season, he scored after six minutes in the club's 2–1 FA Cup win against Havant & Waterlooville in a game played at Fratton Park, netting from close range after good work from Chris Hackett. Five days later, he provided the assist for Darren Byfield's goal in a 2–2 home draw with Doncaster Rovers. May scored his third goal in five appearances when he scored in Millwall's 3–1 loss at Nottingham Forest on 24 November 2006. After Millwall's 2–0 home win against Bradford City, a game in which May assisted Filipe Morais in scoring Millwall's first goal, Millwall manager Willie Donachie stated — [...] "There's more to come from this team, especially Darren Byfield and Ben May, who are as good as anyone in this league. They're committed, honest players who want to work for each other". Three days later, on 12 December 2006, May's pacey cross resulted in Nathan Doyle putting the ball into his own net, giving Millwall a 1–0 win against Bradford City after extra-time in the FA Cup. May scored the only goal of the game in a 1–0 victory at Yeovil Town on 3 February 2007, converting Darren Byfield's cross to give Millwall the three points. However, he was substituted after 53 minutes in the same game with an ankle injury, and in March 2007, he was ruled out of first-team action for the rest of the 2006–07 season. Despite this, he made a second-half substitute appearance on the last day of the season in a 2–2 draw at Bradford City, assisting Darren Byfield's goal just after coming on. May scored four times in 19 appearances in a season disrupted by injuries.|$|E

50|$|The Raiders offense {{completely}} {{struggled to}} move the ball and had several three and outs, mainly due to penalties and dropped passes (notably by Randy Moss who got booed after his second dropped pass) <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> {{would come back to}} haunt them as the Steelers moved down midway through the fourth quarter <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> they would surely tie the game. However, on third and goal, cornerback Chris Carr would intercept Roethlisberger's pass <b>and</b> return <b>it</b> 100 yards for a touchdown. It was the second longest interception return in Raiders history. This gave the Raiders a 20-6 lead. However, they couldn't hold it long, as the Steelers quickly moved downfield and scored the only offensive touchdown of the game, a 25-yard completion to Willie Parker.|$|R
2500|$|The New York Times {{reviewed}} {{one of many}} concerts {{for young}} people with Grieg's music, made popular for today's audiences. The reviewer noted, [...] "Kurt Masur has put youth high on his agenda at the New York Philharmonic, and he was conspicuously present at the orchestra's first Young People's Concert at Avery Fisher Hall on Saturday afternoon.... Children and parents came in fair numbers." [...] However, [...] "the enormous grip of popular culture under which such elements are subsumed <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> Mr. Masur and the Philharmonic will have the fight of their lives." [...] Masur the teacher-conductor [...] "wisely called for the Grieg themes about to be heard. His delivery was warm, not without humor and occasionally muddled by struggles with the language." [...] He even [...] "stopped in mid-performance to admire Irene Breslaw's viola solo [...] and to point out its connection to the American hoedown tradition." [...] In conclusion, The Times asserted that [...] "the melodies, already identified by instrument, emerged from the larger mass and did their work. There is a directness in Grieg's music that travels well across cultural divides." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rutherford died at Beth Sarim on January 8, 1942, {{at the age}} of 72. After his death, Rutherford's burial {{was delayed}} {{for three and a half}} months due to legal {{proceedings}} arising from his desire to be buried at Beth Sarim, which he had previously expressed to three close advisers from Brooklyn headquarters. Watchtower attorney Hayden C. Covington explained his role in the lawsuit: [...] "I filed a lawsuit then in the courts out there in San Diego to force them to let us bury him out there on that property. Judge Mundo, who was the judge of the Superior Court, heard it and passed the buck, jumping from one thing to another, from one technicality to another, and finally after looking at the matter in a reasonable way Bill, Bonnie, and Nathan and all of us decided that we have fought enough on this <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> it's the Lord's will that we take his body back to Brooklyn, and have him buried in Staten Island, which we did."

When I heard the crowd cheering, I gave the ref an earful. I'm not saying that cost us the game. I don't think any of the calls would have changed anything because the 49ers have a better team. But there were some calls out there we should have had." [...] "I'm not going {{to walk out of}} here crying", Redskins coach Joe Gibbs added. [...] "We got beat fair and square. I did think there were some things called wrong. Rice outweighs Darrell Green by 20 pounds and gets 15 yards (for Green's flinging tackle). That's hard to understand." [...] Rypien added [...] "I don't think the score was any indication of how the game was played. We have nothing to be ashamed about other than the score. You look at 28-10 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> they pretty much handled us, but all of you that watched the game know that it's a different story. We had our chances.

Praising the episode's full use of science fiction and the smart structure of the episode, concluding: [...] "It feels like we're back in the sweet spot here, mixing high and low comedy with sharp ideas, and a surprisingly uncynical sincerity. Everything old is new again, I guess, and that's a very good thing." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10, citing it as another example of Futurama's [...] "smart takes" [...] on time travel. He felt that [...] "it showed that there's still a lot of thought going into plotting out these time trips", although he also stated that the episode did not have enough laughs. Merrill Bar of Film School Rejects praised the episode, describing it as [...] "very joke hits, every line was sweet, every emotion is true, every visual was eye popping, this episode is Futurama at its finest. If there is any complaint, it's that it took this long for the show to regain this level of quality." [...] He concluded that [...] "his combined with last week's episode has restored my full confidence in the production team". Sean Gandert of Paste rated the episode a 9.4 out of 10, writing: [...] "'Late' was definitely the best episode of the season so far, and ranks with the best the show's ever done. Nearly every episode of this season has been better than the last, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> it's finally reached the peaks it's hit in the past.
