5|$|Because planetesimals are so numerous, {{and spread}} {{throughout}} the protoplanetary disk, some survive the formation of <b>a</b> <b>planetary</b> system. Asteroids are understood to be left-over planetesimals, gradually grinding each other down into smaller and smaller bits, while comets are typically planetesimals from the farther reaches of <b>a</b> <b>planetary</b> system. Meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach <b>a</b> <b>planetary</b> surface, and provide {{a great deal of}} information about the formation of the Solar System. Primitive-type meteorites are chunks of shattered low-mass planetesimals, where no thermal differentiation took place, while processed-type meteorites are chunks from shattered massive planetesimals.|$|E

5|$|Three star systems {{appear to}} have planets. HD 9446 is a sun-like star around 171 light-years distant that has two planets of masses 0.7 and 1.8 times that of Jupiter, with orbital periods of 30 and 193 days respectively. WASP-56 is a sun-like star of {{spectral}} type G6 and apparent magnitude 11.48 with a planet 0.6 the mass of Jupiter that has a period of 4.6 days. HD 13189 is an orange giant of spectral type K2II about 2–7 times as massive as the sun with <b>a</b> <b>planetary</b> or brown dwarf companion between 8 and 20 times as massive as Jupiter, which takes 472 days to complete an orbit.

5|$|After fusing helium in {{its core}} to carbon, the Sun {{will begin to}} {{collapse}} again, evolving into a compact white dwarf star after ejecting its outer atmosphere as <b>a</b> <b>planetary</b> nebula. In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become tidelocked, with each showing only one face to the other. Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the lunar orbit to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed around Vega, the presence of <b>a</b> <b>planetary</b> system can not yet be ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star. From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E
5|$|In 1500, Nilakantha Somayaji of the Kerala {{school of}} {{astronomy}} and mathematics, in his Tantrasangraha, revised Aryabhata's model.

5|$|Jupiter's {{atmosphere}} {{has multiple}} jet streams, {{caused by the}} convection cells that form the familiar banded color structure; on Jupiter, these convection cells are driven by internal heating. The factors that control the number of jet streams in <b>a</b> <b>planetary</b> atmosphere is an active area of research in dynamical meteorology.

5|$|Launched in 1983, {{the space}} {{telescope}} IRAS detected infrared emissions from stars near to the Sun, including an excess infrared emission from Epsilon Eridani.

Evidence for <b>a</b> <b>planetary</b> system was discovered in 1998 by the observation of asymmetries in this dust ring. The clumping in the dust distribution {{could be explained by}} gravitational interactions with a planet orbiting just inside the dust ring.|$|E
