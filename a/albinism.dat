5|$|Partial <b>albinism</b> — when <b>albinism</b> is {{localized}} {{to certain}} areas of the body.|$|E
5|$|<b>Albinism</b> was {{observed}} in jungle cats (Felis chaus) and jackals (Canis aureus) along the coastline of the southern Western Ghats (Kerala and Kanyakumari coast, India). <b>Albinism</b> {{was observed}} in jungle cats from the Amaravila area of Trivandrum district in the Kerala State. <b>Albinism</b> in jackals was observed from the Polooni area in Malappuram district and Chaliyam area of Calicut district (Kerala).As <b>albinism</b> is observed in those areas where the density of these mammals is comparatively low, it is concluded that continuous inbreeding could be the reason for expression of <b>albinism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Total <b>albinism</b> — a {{simultaneous}} {{complete absence of}} melanin from the eyes, skin, and feathers. This is the rarest form. Only 7% of 1,847 cases of avian <b>albinism</b> examined was this type.|$|E
5|$|<b>Albinism</b> in the African {{lungfish}} {{has been}} reported {{on at least two}} occasions.|$|E
5|$|Imperfect <b>albinism</b> — when melanin {{is reduced}} in the eyes, skin and feathers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Albinism</b> has {{frequently}} occurred in progeny of Black Tartarian, Bing and Hedelfingen varieties of sweet cherry.|$|E
5|$|Incomplete <b>albinism</b> — when melanin is not {{simultaneously}} {{absent from}} the eyes, skin and feathers.|$|E
5|$|Melanin {{has several}} {{functions}} in most mammals and other animals; these are disrupted by <b>albinism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pigmentation {{disorders}} such as <b>albinism</b> are occasionally {{associated with}} hearing impairments in mice, rats, guinea pigs and cats.|$|E
5|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>albinism</b> can be artificially increased in fish by exposing the eggs to heavy metals (e.g. arsenic, cadmium, copper, mercury, selenium, zinc).|$|E
5|$|The yellow {{mutation}} in fruit flies is a mutation causing a congenital lack of normal pigment; it {{is a similar}} phenomenon to <b>albinism</b> in other organisms.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} reports of total <b>albinism</b> in both {{freshwater}} and marine fish, however, frequently captured albino fish are only reported in aquarium magazines and local newspapers.|$|E
5|$|A {{study on}} albinistic prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) found that <b>albinism</b> in this species conferred an {{advantage}} for the males compared to the wild-type; albino males had higher mount frequencies than wild-type males. In addition, the albinos had greater differential fertilizing capacity.|$|E
5|$|Leucism {{differs from}} <b>albinism</b> {{in that the}} melanin is, at least, {{partially}} absent but the eyes retain their usual color. Some leucistic animals are white or pale because of chromatophore (pigment cell) defects, and do not lack melanin.|$|E
5|$|Melanism is {{the direct}} {{opposite}} of <b>albinism.</b> An unusually {{high level of}} melanin pigmentation (and sometimes absence {{of other types of}} pigment in species that have more than one) results in an appearance darker than non-melanistic specimens from the same genepool.|$|E
5|$|The {{costs of}} <b>albinism</b> for marine mammals may include reduced heat {{absorption}} in colder waters, poor camouflage from predators, increased sensitivity to sunlight, and impaired visual communication. Despite the costs, some individuals do reach adult age and breeding status.|$|E
5|$|In European Salamandridae, <b>albinism</b> {{has been}} {{recorded}} in the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), gold-striped salamander (Chioglossa lusitanica), Italian crested newt (Triturus carnifex), marbled newt (Triturus marmoratus), Iberian ribbed newt (Pleurodeles waltl), alpine newt (Ichthyosaura alpestris) and two sub-species of the smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris vulgaris and Lissotriton vulgaris meridionalis).|$|E
5|$|A {{well-known}} allele {{found only}} in the Bengal subspecies produces the white tiger, a colour variant first recorded in the early 19th century and found in an estimated one in 10,000 natural births. Genetically, whiteness is recessive: a cub is white only when both parents carry the allele for whiteness. It is not <b>albinism,</b> pigment being evident in the white tiger's stripes and in their blue eyes. The causative mutation changes a single amino acid in the transporter protein SLC45A2.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study has}} implicated EFS in the Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS). This rare and severe autosomal recessive disorder associated with partial <b>albinism,</b> peripheral neuropathy, mild coagulation defects and propensity to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, caused by incomplete phagocytosis due to failure in phagolysosome formation. This work identified a direct interaction in vitro and in vivo between EFS and LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator, aka CHS1 - Chediak-Higashi syndrome 1), a large protein that regulates the intracellular trafficking of proteins through endosomes that is mutated in CHS. These results may imply {{the role of}} EFS as a disease progression modifier, although further testing and establishment of mechanism is necessary.|$|E
5|$|Bemba was {{the most}} spoken {{language}} with 71.30 per cent speaking it. <b>Albinism</b> is a condition where the victims {{do not have any}} pigment in their skin, hair or eyes. The total population in the province with the condition stood at 2,278. The life expectancy at birth stood at 45 compared to the national average of 51. Luapula is one of the poorest provinces in Zambia with 80.5 per cent of the population accounted as poor and 64.9 as extremely poor as of 2010, compared to 73.9 and 53.5 per cent in 2006. Among all provinces, Luapula recorded the highest TFR of 7.3, and also the highest infant mortality rate (IMR) of 100 deaths per 1,000 births as of 2010.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile terns {{typically}} have brown- or yellow-tinged upperparts, and the feathers have dark edges {{that give the}} plumage a scaly appearance. They have dark bands on the wings and short tails. In most species, the subsequent moult does not start until after migration, the plumage then becoming more like the adult, but with some retained juvenile feathers and a white forehead with only a partial dark cap. By the second summer, the appearance is very like the adult, and full mature plumage is usually attained by the third year. After breeding, terns moult into a winter plumage, typically showing a white forehead. Heavily worn or aberrant plumages such as melanism and <b>albinism</b> are much rarer in terns than in gulls.|$|E
5|$|The {{complete}} set of observable traits {{that make up the}} structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment. As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in genotypic variation; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of <b>albinism,</b> who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn.|$|E
5|$|The white fur on {{the chin}} and around the eyes is in sharp {{contrast}} with the black stripes on the face. The coat of males shows two-tone colouration: while the upper parts and outsides of the legs are dark brown to black, the underparts and the insides of the legs are all white. Darkness typically increases as the male ages. On the other hand, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. In Texas, blackbuck moult in spring, following which the males look notably lighter, though darkness persists on the face and the legs. On the contrary, males will grow darker as the breeding season approaches. Both melanism and <b>albinism</b> have been observed in wild blackbuck. Albino blackbuck are often zoo attractions as in the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (Andhra Pradesh, India).|$|E
5|$|The {{color and}} texture of the coyote's fur varies {{somewhat}} geographically. The hair's predominant color is light gray and red or fulvous, interspersed around the body with black and white. Coyotes living at high elevations {{tend to have more}} black and gray shades than their desert-dwelling counterparts, which are more fulvous or whitish-gray. The coyote's fur consists of short, soft underfur and long, coarse guard hairs. The fur of northern subspecies is longer and denser than in southern forms, with the fur of some Mexican and Central American forms being almost hispid (bristly). Generally, adult coyotes (including coywolf hybrids) have a sable coat color, dark neonatal coat color, bushy tail with an active supracaudal gland, and a white facial mask. <b>Albinism</b> is extremely rare in coyotes; {{out of a total of}} 750,000 coyotes harvested by federal and cooperative hunters between March22, 1938, and June30, 1945, only two were albinos.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportion}} {{of people living}} under poverty line was 60.5 per cent in 2010 compared to 62.8 per cent in 2006 as per the Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS). The extremely poor formed 42.3 per cent {{of the total population}} as against 42.7 per cent in 2007. Around two per cent of the population was disabled, 35 per cent of which is accounted to diseases. Out of the disabled, 90.2 per cent were employed and the literacy rate of the disabled population remained at 58.6 per cent compared to the general literacy rate of 70.2 per cent. <b>Albinism</b> is a condition where people have little or no pigment in their eyes, skin or hair. As per the census, there were 25,324 albino people in the country with 12,532 males (49.48%) and 12,792 females (50.52%). The literacy rate of albino population was 66.1 per cent.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} Portuguese dogfish {{is thick}} and {{cylindrical}} except for the flattened belly. The two dorsal fins are small and of similar size and shape, each bearing a tiny grooved spine in front. The first dorsal fin originates well behind the pectoral fins, while the second dorsal originates over {{the middle of the}} pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are medium-sized with a rounded margin. There is no anal fin. The caudal fin has a short but well-developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The very large dermal denticles change in shape with age: in juveniles, they are widely spaced and heart-shaped with an incomplete midline ridge and three posterior points, while in adults they are overlapping, roughly circular, smooth, and flattened with a round central concavity, superficially resembling the scales of bony fishes. Young sharks are a uniform blue-black in color, while adults are brown-black; there are no prominent fin markings. In 1997, a partially albino individual, with a pale body but normal eyes, was caught in the northeastern Atlantic. This represented the first documented case of <b>albinism</b> in a deep-sea shark.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2010 Zambian census, Central Province had a {{population}} of 1,307,111, comprising 10.05% of the total Zambian population of 13,092,666. There were 648,465 males and 658,646 females, making the sex ratio 1,016 females for every 1,000 males, compared to {{the national average of}} 1,028. The literacy rate stood at 70.90% against a national average of 70.2%. Approximately 74.87% of people lived in rural areas, while 25.13% lived in urban areas. The total area of the province is 94,394 km2 and the population density was 13.80 per km2. The decadal population growth of the province was 2.60%. The median age in the province at the time of marriage was 20.6. The average household size was 5.5, with the average size of families headed by women being 4.8 and 5.8 for families headed by men. In the province, 54.30% were eligible to vote. The unemployment rate was 12.70%. The total fertility rate was 6.3, the complete birth rate was 6.1, the crude birth rate was 36.0, the childwoman ratio at birth was 785, the general fertility rate was 156, the gross reproduction rate was 2.5, and the net reproduction rate was 1.8. The labour force constituted 52.20% of the total population. Out of the labour force, 62.7% were men and 42.2% were women. The annual growth rate of the labour force was 2.2%. Bemba was the most spoken language with 31.80% speaking it. The total population in the province with <b>albinism</b> stood at 3,007. The life expectancy at birth stood at 52 compared to the national average of 51. Lala was the largest clan in the province, comprising 20.3% of population.|$|E
25|$|The National Organization for <b>Albinism</b> and Hypopigmentation (NOAH) {{expressed}} concern about Silas' character giving people with <b>albinism</b> a bad name. However, the filmmakers did not change his appearance.|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} <b>albinism</b> affect only {{the skin and}} hair, while other types affect the skin, hair and eyes, and in rare cases only the eyes. All of them are caused by {{different}} genetic mutations. <b>Albinism</b> is a recessively inherited trait in humans where both pigmented parents may be carriers of the gene and pass it down to their children. Each child has a 25% chance of being albino and a 75% chance of having normally pigmented skin. One common type of <b>albinism</b> is oculocutaneous <b>albinism</b> or OCA, which has many subtypes caused by different genetic mutations.|$|E
25|$|The {{only known}} albino gorilla – named Snowflake – was a wild-born western lowland gorilla {{originally}} from Equatorial Guinea. Snowflake, a male gorilla, {{was taken from}} the wild and brought to the Barcelona Zoo in 1966 at a very young age. Snowflake presented the typical traits and characteristics of <b>albinism</b> typically seen in humans, including white hair, pinkish skin, light colored eyes, reduced visual perception and photophobia (discomfort in bright light). Snowflake was diagnosed by scientists as having non-syndromic <b>albinism.</b> The genetic variant for Snowflake’s <b>albinism</b> was identified by the scientists as a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism located in a transmembrane region of SLC45A2. This transporter is also known to be involved in oculocutaneous <b>albinism</b> type 4 in humans. This information revealed the first evidence of inbreeding in western lowland gorillas.|$|E
25|$|One of the sangomas, or witchdoctors, in Shaka Zulu has <b>albinism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Various {{types of}} <b>albinism</b> {{are a result}} of genetic {{mutations}} affecting different parts of the melanin production pathway. In a person with <b>albinism,</b> melanocytes can be entirely absent, or fail to produce melanin, or melanosomes can fail to mature and be transferred to keranocytes. The ability to produce melanin in patches around the body is a condition known as vitiligo.|$|E
25|$|The MATP gene {{is highly}} conserved, {{especially}} among mammals. The human MATP gene is 82% {{identical to the}} mouse MATP gene, 79% identical to the rat MATP gene, 35% to the zebrafish version, and 30% identical to the fruitfly MATP gene. The gene is best known in humans as being {{the location of a}} mutation that results in human type IV oculocutaneous <b>albinism</b> (OCA4). Type IV oculocutaneous <b>albinism,</b> like other types of human <b>albinism,</b> results in hypopigmentation of the skin and eyes, with increased rates of skin cancer and reduced visual acuity. None of these effects are associated with the equine cream gene. Other human MATP polymorphisms result in normal pigment variations, specifically fair skin, light eyes, and light hair in Caucasian populations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Albinism</b> is {{a serious}} problem in areas of high {{sunlight}} intensity, leading to extreme sun sensitivity, skin cancer, and eye damage.|$|E
