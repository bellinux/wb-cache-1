2500|$|Compared {{with some}} low cost cameras that provide an optical {{viewfinder}} {{that uses a}} small <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lens,</b> the DSLR design {{has the advantage of}} being parallax-free: it never provides an off-axis view. A disadvantage of the DSLR optical viewfinder system is that when it is used, it prevents using the LCD for viewing and composing the picture. Some people prefer to compose pictures on the display– for them this has become the de facto way to use a camera. Depending on the viewing position of the reflex mirror (down or up), the light from the scene can only reach either the viewfinder or the sensor. Therefore, many early DSLRs did not provide [...] "live preview" [...] (i.e., focusing, framing, and depth-of-field preview using the display), a facility that is always available on digicams. Today most DSLRs can alternate between live view and viewing through an optical viewfinder.|$|E
50|$|For the pictured Petri 7 1.8 {{the company}} offered a kit that {{included}} a front adapter lens marked AUX TELEPHOTO which screws onto the primary lens; a similar lens for WIDE ANGLE is in the kit. The kit includes an optical view finder, TELE-WIDE FINDER, which attaches on the flash shoe and contains two optically marked frames showing telephoto and wide angle. This kit works on the Petri 7 1.9 and the Petri 7 1.8 camera. The single primary lens diaphragm works with these adapted lens mounted on the front, a lower cost design than lenses that include all the back glass and diaphragm with each lens. The camera with primary lens is 13 cm wide, 8 cm tall and 7 cm deep, All these lens have 3.5 cm screw rings. Metering {{is powered by a}} ring photocell so no battery is required. Focus is manual on primary lens/viewfinder so the photographer must match the yellow/tinted image with the clear one in the primary viewfinder, then shift the eye to the auxiliary viewfinder to frame the picture when an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lens</b> is used. 1.8 Camera weighs 710 grams (1 lb 9 oz).|$|E
40|$|A quasi-microscope concept, {{consisting}} of facsimile camera augmented with an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lens</b> as a magnifier, was introduced and analyzed. The performance achievable with this concept was primarily limited by a trade-off between resolution and object field; this approach {{leads to a}} limiting resolution of 20 microns when used with the Viking lander camera (which has an angular resolution of 0. 04 deg). An optical system is analyzed which includes a field lens between camera and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lens</b> to overcome this limitation. It is found that this system, {{referred to as a}} compound quasi-microscope, can provide improved resolution (to about 2 microns) and a larger object field. However, this improvement is at the expense of increased complexity, special camera design requirements, and tighter tolerances on the distances between optical components...|$|E

50|$|The optical {{design of}} fundus cameras {{is based on}} the {{principle}} of monocular indirect ophthalmoscopy. A fundus camera provides an upright, magnified view of the fundus. A typical camera views 30 to 50° of retinal area, with a magnification of 2.5x, and allows some modification of this relationship through zoom or <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lenses</b> from 15°, which provides 5x magnification, to 140° with a wide angle lens, which minifies the image by half. The optics of a fundus camera {{are similar to those of}} an indirect ophthalmoscope in that the observation and illumination systems follow dissimilar paths.|$|R
50|$|Fundus {{observation}} is {{known by the}} ophthalmic {{and the use of}} fundus cameras. With the slit lamp, however, direct observation of the fundus is impossible due to the refractive power of the ocular media. In other words: the far point of the eye (punctum remotum) is so distant in front of (myopia) or behind (hyperopia) that the microscope cannot be focused. The use of auxiliary optics - generally as a lens - makes it possible however to bring the far point within the focusing range of the microscope. For this various <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lenses</b> are in use that range in optical properties and practical application.|$|R
40|$|The simple Badal Optometer {{consists}} of a movable target and a fixed positive power lens placed at its focal distance away from the eye. The perceived angular size of the target is independent of target position and the power scale is linear. Limitations of the simple Badal Optometer include restriction of negative (myopic) ocular vergence range, the need for targets to be small, {{and the problem of}} "proximal" accommodation. We describe two modifications to the Badal system in which these limitations may be overcome by the use of a movable auxiliary optical system. In one modification, the movable auxiliary system {{consists of}} a target and positive lens which together may provide a virtual "target" for the Badal lens and thus increase the negative range. In the second modification, the Badal lens is positioned as it would normally be, but the target is an image of a distant stimulus created by the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lens.</b> The target position (and hence the ocular vergence) is changed by moving the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lens.</b> The distant target eliminates the proximal accommodation stimulus and allows spatial detail near the resolution limit to be displayed...|$|E
40|$|During tests {{subsequent}} to those {{from which this}} report was prepared, {{it was found that}} a constant per-centage error had been introduced into strain readings made with the particular Tucker&an extensometer used, because its collimator had been equipped with an objective lens of focal length diflering from the standard value for this instrument. An investigation has disclosed that this collimator was a very early type.

Though in our study we have assumed convex-plano lenses are in use, the same procedure can sometimes be applied to lenses of different forms.

40|$|The point spread {{function}} (PSF) inconsistency {{caused by}} temperature variation leads to artifacts in decoded {{images of a}} wavefront coding infrared imaging system. Therefore, this paper proposes an analytical model for the effect of temperature variation on the PSF consistency. In the proposed model, a formula for the thermal deformation of an optical phase mask is derived. This formula indicates that a cubic optical phase mask (CPM) is still cubic after thermal deformation. A proposed equivalent cubic phase mask (E-CPM) is a virtual and room-temperature lens which characterizes the optical effect of temperature variation on the CPM. Additionally, a calculating method for PSF consistency after temperature variation is presented. Numerical simulation illustrates {{the validity of the}} proposed model and some significant conclusions are drawn. Given the form parameter, the PSF consistency achieved by a Ge-material CPM is better than the PSF consistency by a ZnSe-material CPM. The effect of the optical phase mask on PSF inconsistency is much slighter than that of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lens</b> group. A large form parameter of the CPM will introduce large defocus-insensitive aberrations, which improves the PSF consistency but degrades the room-temperature MTF...|$|E
50|$|Also in 1909, Henry DeZeng got {{a patent}} for what looks remarkably like a modern phoropter, but the patent {{illustrations}} look {{nothing like the}} manufactured product, which was introduced around 1915--the DeZeng Phoro-Optometer model 570. This was a device produced in Camden, New Jersey, which contained a battery of convex lenses for each eye, a battery of concave lenses for each eye, and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lenses</b> which gave it a total power range of +15.75 to -19.75, {{as well as a}} Maddox rod and Risley prism for each eye, and a Steven's phorometer. There were no cylindrical lenses, so testing for astigmatism required the use of manual trial-lenses, for which there were rotating holders on the front of each eye hole, and there were stationary ones on the backs as well. Cross-cylinders were optional, but they did not flip like a Jackson cross cylinder, they rotated in the same plane, so they were probably meant for the near point cross-cylinder test for reading. It weighed 3 lb. 2 oz. Around 1920 an improved model, No. 574, was introduced, reduced in size but with the same range (lenses reduced from 1 inch to ¾ inch). The forehead rest was removed, and the rear trial lens clips were replaced with rubber eye guards. It weighed 2 lbs. 12 oz. In 1922, DeZeng replaced No. 574 with No. 584, and shortened the name to Phoroptor. This device became so popular that its name became genericized, though often spelled phoropter. The Phoroptor was smaller (lenses reduced again, to 9/16 inch diameter) and more precisely made than the 574, but with a similar power range, and the front clips for hand-held trial lenses were removed and replaced with batteries of cylinder lenses ranging from -0.25 to -4.75. The Steven's phorometer was dropped, and there were no Jackson cross cylinders. It weighed 2 lb. 8 oz. In 1925, American Optical Co. bought DeZeng, and in 1927 introduced No. 588, the AO Wellsworth DeZeng Phoroptor, which was slightly larger; the lenses were increased to 11/16 inch and it weighed 3 lb. 2 oz. This was the first in the DeZeng/AO line to hang from a horizontal mounting bar, the earlier ones were supported from a bar below it. This phoroptor was unique in that it was calibrated in 1/8 diopter steps throughout its whole range. In 1934, AO introduced No. 589, the Additive Effective Power Phoroptor, once again enlarged and improved. The lenses were increased to ¾ inch diameter, the permanent size, and the unit was much more massive, with a weight of 7 lb. 9 oz., and with a range of +16.87 to -19.12 and -6.00 cylinder, with <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lenses</b> to increase these to +18.87/-21.12/-8.00. All these models resembled the original DeZeng model in design, but No. 590 of 1948 was a completely re-designed device, much larger and heavier, and more modern. It weighed 10 lbs. 7 oz. This was followed by another complete re-design in 1956, the RxMaster, which became the prototype of all modern phoropters, and was updated to the Ultramatic RxMaster in 1967, which is the current model. AO sold their phoroptor division to Reichert in 1982, who still makes the Ultramatic.|$|R
5000|$|Placing an <b>auxiliary</b> {{close-up}} <b>lens</b> (or close-up [...] "filter") {{in front}} of the camera's lens is another option. Inexpensive screw-in or slip-on attachments provide close focusing. The possible quality is less than that of a dedicated macro lens or extension tubes, with some two-element versions being very good while many inexpensive single element lenses exhibit chromatic aberration and reduced sharpness of the resulting image. This method works with cameras that have fixed lenses, and is commonly used with bridge cameras. These lenses add diopters to the optical power of the lens, decreasing the minimum focusing distance, and allowing the camera to get closer to the subject. They are typically designated by their diopter, and can be stacked (with an additional loss of quality) to achieve the desired magnification.|$|R
40|$|Most {{wide-angle}} lenses are not {{wide enough}} to show an entire room with material possessions in context. However, such wide coverage can be accomplished with a fish-eye <b>lens.</b> Recently, fish-eye <b>auxiliary</b> <b>lenses</b> have become available at low cost, making them affordable for most ethnographers. The author demonstrates the use-fulness of a fish-eye lens with a photograph of his living room in Albuquerque. The limitations of standard lenses are shown with Vicos (Peru) photographs by John Col-lier, Jr. Fish-eye lenses {{can also be used}} to document the personnel present at meetings. I first thought of using a fish-eye lens during my first summer of fieldwork as a beginning anthropology graduate student. I had just completed my first year and was undecided about whether I wanted to be an archaeologist or a cul-tural anthropologist. I had to get archaeology into or out of my system. I was lucky and got a job as project photographer at Mesa Verde National Park with the Wetherill Mesa Project. I had to photograph many kivas, rooms, and other architectural features of Anasazi ruins. It frustrated me that none of my wide-angle lenses could take in enough to show what I thought was sufficient context. For example, even the widest lens did not show how all the features of a room related to each other. In addition, as the season progressed it was often difficult to visually correlate images that covered only partial views at differ-ent levels of excavation. In 1959, it was impossible to do this with one global photograph, and, if it was attempted at all, an integrated picture had to be pieced together with scissors and paste, from partial views. That was when I first thought of using a fish-eye lens. There are many other applications of fish-eye lenses in anthropology (and I am sure our readers can think of many more). For example, an extreme wide-angle lens can be used to document who was present at a meet-I am grateful to Malcolm Collier for providing scans of several Vicos photographs and brief cap...|$|R
50|$|Treatment {{is done by}} {{changing}} the optical magnification properties of the <b>auxiliary</b> optics (corrective <b>lenses).</b> The optical magnification properties of spectacle lenses can be adjusted {{by changing}} parameters like the base curve, vertex distance, and center thickness. Contact lenses may also provide a better optical magnification to reduce the difference in image size.

The optimum design solution will depend on different parameters like cost, cosmetic implications, and if the patient can tolerate wearing a contact lens.|$|R
50|$|The {{result is}} a visual {{reproduction}} complete with all significant depth cues, including parallax in all directions, perspective that changes with the position and distance of the observer, and, if the lenses are small enough and the images of sufficient quality, the cue of accommodation — the adjustments of eye focus required to clearly see objects at different distances. Unlike the voxels in a true volumetric display, the image points perceived through the microlens array are virtual and have only a subjective location in space, allowing a scene of infinite depth to be displayed without resorting to an <b>auxiliary</b> large magnifying <b>lens</b> or mirror.|$|R
50|$|In 1909, Nathan Shigon of New York City {{invented a}} monocular optometer {{with a range}} of +0.25 to +6.00 diopters, {{consisting}} of a mechanism where a disc of low-powered lenses advanced a second disc of higher power lenses automatically with each rotation, as in a modern phoropter. There is no evidence this was ever manufactured, but in 1915 he filed for a patent for a binocular version of this same optometer, and called it the Ski-Optometer, so named for its usefulness in doing skiascopy. This was manufactured by Wm. F. Reimold of Philadelphia. It included a Stevens Phorometer for measuring phorias, and a disc of <b>auxiliary</b> spherical <b>lenses</b> on the back, giving it a range of -12.00 to +12.00. To extend the range, there were clips on the front of each eye hole for the insertion of hand held sphere or cylinder trial lenses, with a mechanism to rotate the axis with the thumb. It weighed 2 lb. 3 oz. Around 1916 Michael Woolf, also of New York City, bought him out and added his own invention, an innovative battery of cylinder lenses, ranging from -0.25 to -2.00, to the device, as well as Risley prisms for each eye. Maddox rods were optional. It weighed 3 lb. 13 oz. Around 1924 the patents and rights were transferred to General Optical Company of Mount Vernon, NY, which had been making a much larger, heavier and more solidly encased instrument, called the Genothalmic Refractor, since around 1920, using Woolf's 1917 patent number, and with a user's manual dated 1921. This instrument had a range of +17.75 to - 22.50, and up to -3.75 cylinder, Maddox rods, Risley prisms, and a Steven's phorometer. It weighed 7 pounds 5 ounces, and unlike all earlier devices of this kind, it hung from a horizontal mounting bar instead of being supported from the bottom. Like the Woolf, it had no Jackson cross-cylinders at first, so a separate hand-held one was required. Late models of the Genothalmic were fitted with JCC's. General Optical sold out to Shuron Optical of Geneva, NY in 1927, which sold the refractor until the late 1930s. A refined and improved version of the Genothalmic Refrator was manufactured in London starting around 1932, and sold in the UK by S. R. Stearman, S. Pulzer & Son Ltd., and others, as the British Refracting Unit (B.R.U.).|$|R
