50|$|Despite its {{preference}} for ground-dwelling avian prey, a surprisingly {{considerable number of}} water birds may also be attacked. Waterfowl known to be attacked include the 1.18 kg South African shelduck (Tadorna cana), 1 kg yellow-billed duck (<b>Anas</b> <b>undulata),</b> the 4.43 kg spur-winged goose (Plectropterus gambensis) (Africa’s largest waterfowl species) and especially the peculiar, overly bold and aggressive 1.76 kg Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiaca), {{which is one of}} the main prey species for martial eagles in Kruger National Park. Larger wading birds are also fairly frequently attacked including herons and egrets, flamingoes storks, ibises, spoonbills and cranes. The diversity and number of storks taken is particularly impressive. They are known to take 8 species of stork, ranging from the smallest known species, the 1.08 kg African openbill (Anastomus lamelligerus), to the tallest species in the world, the 6.16 kg, 1.5 m-tall saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis). One naturalists observed up to a half dozen attacks in different parts of Africa on 3.45 kg white storks (Ciconia ciconia). Short of three attacks on spotted thick-knees (Burhinus capensis), which weigh about 0.42 kg, so far as is known small waders or shorebirds are ignored as prey. Other assorted avian prey may consists of ostrich (Struthio camelus) chicks (frequently resulting in the immediate ire of protective ostrich parents), sandgrouse, pigeons and doves, hornbills and crows. Beyond occasional captures of other birds of prey (covered later), one other impressive avian prey species is the southern ground hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri), which at 3.77 kg is probably the world’s largest hornbill. At the other end of the scale, some martial eagles may capture a few small social species of passerine, which are exceptionally small prey (the smallest recorded prey species for the eagle overall), potentially consisting of the 18.6 g red-billed queleas (Quelea quelea) and the 27.4 g sociable weavers (Philetairus socius), as practically every meat-eating bird in Africa may be attracted to these species’ colonial abundance.|$|E
50|$|Verreaux's eagle-owl takes {{a diverse}} range of birds as prey. More than 50 avian prey species have been {{identified}} and they may locally exceed mammals in importance in the diet, somewhat unusually for eagle-owls. No one type of bird {{can be said to}} be predictably favored as prey and any avian species unfortunate enough to have a nighttime roost or nest that happens to be in an eagle-owl's foraging path may fall victim to this species. Many cases of predation involve nest robbery, with nestlings or fledglings being taken, although adult birds may be taken just as often, especially for species with less conspicuous nests. In South Africa's De Hoop Nature Reserve, it was found that birds were somewhat better represented by both number, 43.3% of remains, and biomass, 57.84% of remains, than mammals or any other prey group. The species best represented in biomass in the prior study was the black-headed heron (Ardea melanocephala) with several adults estimated to average 1260 g being found among the prey remains. Other fairly common, largish herons are also known to fall prey at night to Verreaux's eagle-owl including the 873 g great egret (Ardea alba), the 1443 g grey heron (Ardea cinerea) and the 975 g purple heron (Ardea purpurea). Other medium-sized water birds known to have been represented in this species diet include the 1008 g yellow-billed duck (<b>Anas</b> <b>undulata),</b> the 983 g African black duck (Anas sparsa), the 596 g African swamphen (Porphyrio madagascariensis) and the 825 g red-knobbed coot (Fulica cristata). Besides herons, another well-represented group of birds in the diet are galliforms. Perhaps the most widely prey species reported from this group is the 1229 g helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris), which may seasonally dominate the eagle-owl's food in Kenya. More modestly sized wild galliform species reported in the diet including the 96 g common quail (Coturnix coturnix) and the 390 g grey-winged francolin (Francolinus africanus). Domestic fowl, especially those allowed back to a semi-feral state and thus sleeping in the open as is prevalent in Africa, are taken when encountered, including chickens and peafowls.|$|E
40|$|Thirty-four {{species of}} {{gastrointestinal}} helminths {{were found in}} 25 <b>Anas</b> <b>undulata,</b> 21 Anas erythrorhyncha, ten Anas capensis and seven Anas smithii collected at Barberspan, South Africa. Excluding four new taxa, 11 new African records, and 14, 11, 12 and nine new host records were established for <b>Anas</b> <b>undulata,</b> Anas erythrorhyncha, Anas capensis and Anas smithii, respectively. The helminth community included 13 cosmopolitan species, seven species known only from the holarctic, one species known only from the south Pacific and 13 new or unidentified species {{that appear to be}} restricted to Africa. The infection levels of the common helminth species in the mainly carnivorous Anas capensis and Anas smithii, were generally much higher than those of species infecting <b>Anas</b> <b>undulata</b> or Anas erythrorhyncha.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. Waterfowl annual {{life history}} events in north-temperate regions are driven {{primarily}} by predictable seasonal variations in temperature. In contrast, the spatio-temporal availability of adequate resources to waterfowl in the semi-arid regions of southern Africa {{is determined by}} rainfall which is extremely variable in timing and intensity. I studied the environmental influences on flight-feather moult and movement strategies of southern African waterfowl. Six duck species that are fairly common {{in most parts of}} South Africa were selected for the study, namely; Egyptian Geese, Alopochen aegyptiaca, Spur-winged Geese, Plectropterus gambensis, South African Shelducks, Tadorna cana, Yellow-billed Ducks, <b>Anas</b> <b>undulata,</b> Red-billed Teals, A. erythrorhyncha and Southern Pochards, Netta erythrophthalma. I chose two study sites to represent the extremes of environmental conditions in southern African, namely Barberspan (summer-rainfall region) and Strandfontein (temperate winter-rainfall region). I investigated the underlying responses of Afrotropical waterfowl to stochastic varying environmental conditions in southern Africa and the life-history strategies they have evolved to cope with this variability. The study also compares and contrasts the life-history strategies of southern hemisphere waterfowl with those of the northern hemisphere...|$|E
40|$|Examination of the {{helminth}} {{communities in}} 25 yellow-billed ducks (<b>Anas</b> <b>undulata),</b> 21 red-billed ducks (Anas erythrorhyncha), ten Cape teal (Anas capensis) and seven Cape shovellers (Anas smithii) that had overwintered at Barberspan, revealed differences in community structure. Infracommunities in yellow-billed and red-billed ducks {{were characterized by}} low diversity and high eveness, and generally consisted of less than 100 helminths per duck. Similarity values (mean percent similarity and mean Jaccard's coefficients) were low. In contrast, infracommunities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers were more diverse, displayed low eveness values and consisted of far greater numbers of helminths. Mean similarity values for the infracommunities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers were much higher than those in yellow-billed or red-billed ducks. The component communities in all four duck hosts were species rich. Those in yellow-billed and red-billed ducks, however, consisted predominantly of satellite species and no core species were present, whereas those in Cape teal and Cape shoveller included several core species. Cape teal and Cape shovellers each had a group of recurrent species but {{there was not much}} of a tendency for species to co-occur in yellow-billed and red-billed ducks. Multivariate analysis revealed a greater similarity between the communities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers than between the latter and the communities in yellow- billed or red-billed ducks. Communities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers could be distinguished from each other by {{the presence or absence of}} particular cestode species. The communities in these two species could be distinguished from those in yellow-billed or red-billed ducks by a suite of cestode species that was absent in the latter two. Two recurrent groups, consisting of eight and two species, were identified in the compound community. Each group consisted of species found predominantly in Cape teal and Cape shovellers. Patterns seen in the helminth communities of the various hosts reflected differences in diet, but other factors, including feeding behaviour, spatial segregation and host specificity, may also have had an effect.
