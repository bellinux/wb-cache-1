40|$|Abstract. In {{the context}} of a GOCE {{regional}} vali-dation and combination experiment in Germany, a work package {{within the framework of the}} GOCE-GRAND II project, gravity observations, vertical deflections and GPS/levelling data are collected as independent data sets. The observation of absolute gravity values is carried out by the Bundesamt für Kartographie und Geodäsie (BKG), while the vertical deflections are observed by the Institut für Erdmessung (IfE) using the Hannover digital transportable zenith camera system TZK 2 -D. The vertical deflections have an accuracy of approx. 0. 1 arc seconds and are arranged along a north-south and east-west profile. The two profiles have a length of about 500 km each with a spacing of 2. 5 – 5 km between adjacent stations. Furthermore, a national GPS and levelling data set of about 900 stations with an accuracy of approx. 1 cm is available for Germany. The analysis of the vertical deflections is carried out by the <b>astronomical</b> <b>levelling</b> method, resulting in two (quasi) geoid profiles. The accuracy of the profiles is expected to be at the cm level. A cross-validation of both the vertical deflection and GPS/-levelling data is realised by traversing the profiles through all nearby GPS/levelling stations (approx. 40 in total). In addition, comparisons are performe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{regions with}} a rough topography, e. g. the European Alps, the {{accuracy}} of geoid or quasi-geoid models is often reduced. For the valida-tion and accuracy assessment of gravimetric mod-els, <b>astronomical</b> <b>levelling</b> is a well-suited indepen-dent method. In a test area, located in the German Alps, a new astrogeodetic data set was acquired using the Hannover Digital Zenith Camera System. Verti-cal deflections were determined at 100 new stations (spacing about 230 m) arranged in a profile of 23 km length. Repeated observations at 38 stations in differ-ent nights reveal an observational accuracy of about [...] In order to precisely interpolate the vertical de-flection data between adjacent stations, topographic reductions of the observed deflections are carried out using a high-resolution digital terrain model. A least squares prediction approach is applied for the inter-polation of a dense profile of deflection data. Eventu-ally, the topography effect is restored. By computing the normal correction, the deflection data is reduced to the quasigeoid domain. The accuracy of the com-puted astrogeodetic quasigeoid profile {{is estimated to be}} at the millimeter-level. The available quasi-geoid models, namely the German Combined Geoid GCG 2005, the Digital Finite Height Reference Sur-face DFHRS and the quasigeoid by IAPG (TU Mu-nich), are in agreement with the high-precision astro-geodetic quasigeoid profile by about 8 mm, 20 mm and 4 mm (RMS), respectively. A comparison of the astrogeodetic profile with GPS/levelling data yielded differences of 10 mm...|$|E
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century, a technological change took place in geodetic astronomy by the development of Digital Zenith Camera Systems (DZCS). Such instruments provide vertical deflection data at an angular accuracy level of 0 ". 1 and better. Recently, DZCS have been employed for the collection of dense sets of astrogeodetic vertical deflection data in several test areas in Germany with high-resolution digital terrain model (DTM) data (10 - 50 m resolution) available. These considerable advancements motivate a new analysis of the method of astronomical-topographic levelling, which uses DTM data for the interpolation between the astrogeodetic stations. We present and analyse a least-squares collocation technique that uses DTM data for the accurate interpolation of vertical deflection data. The combination of both data sets allows a precise determination of the gravity field along profiles, even in regions with a rugged topography. The accuracy of the method is studied with particular attention on the density of astrogeodetic stations. The error propagation rule of <b>astronomical</b> <b>levelling</b> is empirically derived. It accounts for the signal omission that increases with the station spacing. In a test area located in the German Alps, the method was successfully applied to the determination of a quasigeoid profile of 23 km length. For a station spacing from a few 100 m to about 2 km, the accuracy of the quasigeoid was found to be about 1 - 2 mm, which corresponds to a relative accuracy of about 0. 05 - 0. 1 ppm. Application examples are given, such as the local and regional validation of gravity field models computed from gravimetric data and the economic gravity field determination in geodetically less covered regions...|$|E

This, amongst others, includes {{the extent to which}} the commercial banks are able to discharge their intermediating role in the demand and supply of credit necessary to sustain commercial businesses. Indeed, in the last decade, the Nigerian banking industry has witnessed swings with the attendant effects on the business community. One of the downsides has been the incidence of loan default which led to many banks recording <b>astronomical</b> <b>levels</b> of bad loans in their 2008 financial reports. The drastic measures taken by the Central Bank of Nigeria of relieving eight CEOs of their jobs in September 2009 further highlights the import of this subject matter. This paper gives an overview of the concept of loan default in Nigerian commercial banks ranging from the causes to the remedies currently in place to checkmate it. A field survey on loan officers, credit analysts and credit risk managers in some select banks was carried out. The findings reveal that the banks have a rather cautious approach to lending with certain classes of loans classified. Causal factors leading to loan delinquencies categorised into environmental, bank specific and borrower specific factors were analysed to have contributed equally to causing loan default in Nigeria. Lastly, the regression results indicated that there was a significant relationship between measures adopted by the banks in the face of incre...|$|R

This paper explores an artificial neural network (ANN) model, including the back propagation neural network (BPNN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithms used to correct poor calculations with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model in predicting storm surge height during typhoon events. The two-dimensional model has a fine horizontal resolution and considers the interaction between storm surges and astronomical tides, which can be applied for describing the complicated physical properties of storm surges along {{the east coast of}} Taiwan. The model is driven by the tidal elevation at the open boundaries using a global ocean tidal model and is forced by the meteorological conditions using a cyclone model. The simulated results of the hydrodynamic model indicate that this model fails to predict storm surge height during the model calibration and verification phases as typhoons approached the east coast of Taiwan. The BPNN model can reproduce the <b>astronomical</b> tide <b>level</b> but fails to modify the prediction of the storm surge tide level.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{analyzes}} {{historical archives}} {{to produce a}} database of storm-induced coastal flooding in the French cen- tral part of the Bay of Biscay since 1500 AD. From this new database, 46 coastal floods have been reported for the last 500 years (1 event every 11 yr on average), which demonstrates the high vulnerability of this region to coast- al flooding. The limitations of historical archives prevent concluding {{to a change in}} storminess over the period. The six largest coastal floods that occurred since 1900 are further investigated because numerous informations are available in terms of meteorological conditions as well as maximum water levels reached. Associated storm surges are also modeled using a simplified methodology, relying on a fully coupled wave and circulation modeling system directly forced by the available meteorological data. The analysis of modeling results and histor- ical archives reveals firstly that several meteo-oceanic settings can lead to extensive coastal flooding in the stud- ied area. The analyzed events allow distinguishing three main settings: (1) a small storm surge associated with the highest <b>astronomical</b> tidal <b>levels,</b> (2) a large storm surge, induced either by extreme winds or a particular sea-state and associated with high <b>astronomical</b> tidal <b>levels</b> and, (3) a large storm surge enhanced by extreme wave conditions. Second, maximum water levels reached during these 6 coastal floods were shown to be higher than the 100 years return period water level estimated in several recently published studies. This inconstancy can be explained mainly by the lack of extreme water level records in tide gauge datasets used in these previous studies. To a slightest degree, this study questions the validity of classical statistical approaches when analyzing extreme water levels data resulting from contrasting meteo-oceanic settings. It is concluded that historical ar- chives combined with storm surge modeling could be a valuable approach to better estimate the return period of extreme sea levels and improve the understanding on the vulnerability of mixed-energy coastal environments such as the study area...|$|R
