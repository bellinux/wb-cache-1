To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from an absorption load installed deep inside the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E

5|$|Titanic had a {{total of}} 20 lifeboats, {{comprising}} 16wooden boats on davits, 8 {{on either side of}} the ship, and 4 collapsible boats with wooden bottoms and canvas sides. The collapsibles were stored upside down with the sides folded in, and would have to be erected and moved to the davits for launching. Two were stored under the wooden boats and the other two were lashed atop the officers' quarters. The position of the latter would make them extremely difficult to launch, as they weighed several tons each and had to be manhandled down to the boat deck. On average, the lifeboats could take up to 68 people each, and collectively they could accommodate 1,178– barely half the number of people on board and a third of the number the ship was licensed to carry. The shortage of lifeboats was not because of a lack of space nor because of cost.

It is generally accepted that isolated pulsars are born during Type-II supernova explosions following the core collapse of the massive progenitor. If the explosion is asymmetric, the collapsed core of the progenitor, i. e. the newborn neutron star, is expected to acquire a recoil velocity. Isolated pulsars are thus characterized by an intrinsic proper motion on the plane of the sky, which scales directly with the ratio between the pulsar projecte...|$|R

These particles are assumed to constitute <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> <b>fraction</b> ξ_X <b>of</b> CDM in the Universe, with ξ_X being the same in the halo of our Galaxy and in the intergalactic space. The elementary-particle and cosmological scenarios for these particles are briefly outlined. The UHE CR fluxes produced at the decays of X- particles are calculated. The dominant contribution is given by fluxes of photons and nucleons from the halo of our Galaxy and thus they do not exibit the GZK cutoff. The extragalactic components of UHE CR are suppressed by the smaller extragalactic density of X-particles and hence the cascade limit is relaxed.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} current debate {{on the state of}} modern {{macroeconomics}} from methodological standpoint. While some senior figures in economics have argued that modern macroeconomics has gone wayward and thus become irrelevant for policy, others argue otherwise. Methodologically, the fundamental sources of dispute have centered on realism of assumptions, mathematical formalism and empiricism and falsification of economic models. Our conclusion from this review is that the observable world upon which macroeconomist rely on to make their assumptions, theories and predictions represent <b>a</b> very <b>tiny</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> physical reality. Thus any policy derived from such partial and short sighted analysis can only produce a sub-optimal outcome. Moreover, the fundamental analysis employed in macroeconomic analysis overlook peculiarities which should be the rule rather than the exception for addressing important economic conundrums. In short, although we do not support the position of most critics on the view that macroeconomics of the last 30 years is completely useless, we are of the view that there is need for serious rethinking about the future of macroeconomics. This is the only way forward, if the subject has anything to say about policy...|$|R

40|$|Practical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) such as {{design of}} {{integrated}} circuits or scheduling generally entail large search spaces with hundreds or {{even thousands of}} variables, each with {{hundreds or thousands of}} possible values. Often, only <b>a</b> very <b>tiny</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> all these possible assignments participates in a satisfactory solution. This article discusses techniques that aim at reducing the effective size of the search space to be explored in order to find a satisfactory solution by judiciously selecting the order in which variables are instantiated and the sequence in which possible values are tried for each variable. In the CSP literature, these techniques are commonly referred to as variable and value ordering heuristics. Our investigation is conducted in the job shop scheduling domain. We show that, in contrast with problems studied earlier in the CSP literature, generic variable and value heuristics do not perform well in this domain. This is attributed to the difficulty of these heuristics to properly account for the tightness of constraints and/or the connectivity of the constraint graphs induced by job shop scheduling CSPs. A new probabilistic framework is introduced that better captures these key aspects of the job shop scheduling search space. Empirical results show that variable and value ordering heuristic...|$|R

A simple analogy compares the wealth in a society with the energy in a physical system, and the trade between agents to the energy exchange between molecules during collisions.

Here we present an exchange model where the goal is not only to avoid condensation but also to reduce the inequality; to carry out this objective the choice of interacting agents is not at random, but follows an extremal dynamics regulated by the wealth of the agent. The wealth of the agent with the minimum capital is changed at random and the difference between the ancient and the new wealth of this poorest agent is taken from other agents, so establishing a regulatory tool for wealth redistribution. We compare different redistribution processes and conclude that a drastic reduction of the inequality can be obtained with very simple regulations. ...|$|R
