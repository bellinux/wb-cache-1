For example, see McQuarrie Hildebrand, and von Schwerin. Below is an example of this usage as employed in the design of robotic manipulators: In the above Lagrange-Eulerequations, there are three types of terms. The first involves the second derivative of the generalized co-ordinates. The second is quadratic in [...] where the coefficients may depend on [...] These are further classified into two types. Terms involving a product of the type [...] are called centrifugal forces while those involving a product of the type [...] for i ≠ j are called Coriolis forces.

The characteristics of the environment-behavior relations selected by the action of reinforcement on the connectivity of the network are consistent with behavior-analytic formulations: Operants are not elicited but, instead, the network permits them to be guided by the environment. Moreover, the guidance of behavior is context dependent, with the pathways activated by a stimulus determined in part by what other stimuli are acting on the network at that moment.
