5|$|Albatrosses live {{much longer}} than other birds; they delay {{breeding}} for longer and invest more effort into fewer young. Most species survive upwards of 50 years, the oldest recorded being a Laysan albatross named Wisdom that was ringed in 1956 as a mature adult and hatched another chick in February 2017, making her at least 66 years old. She is the oldest confirmed wild bird as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> banded bird in the world.|$|E
5|$|Béla Bánáthy {{was born}} in 1919 in Gyula, Hungary, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> of four sons. His father Peter was a {{minister}} of the Reformed Church in Hungary and his mother Hildegard Pallmann was a teacher. Peter Bánáthy had earned the honorary title Vitéz for his service during World War I, and Béla, as his oldest son, inherited the title.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, a safe was {{discovered}} during excavations of a burial trench at the Hanford nuclear site. Inside the safe were various items, including a large glass bottle containing a whitish slurry which was subsequently identified <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> sample of weapons-grade plutonium known to exist. Isotope analysis by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory {{indicated that the}} plutonium in the bottle was manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge during 1944.|$|E

5|$|Leaving the United States Army a {{few years}} before it was integrated, Matthews then {{took a job as a}} {{security}} guard in Maryland, rising to the rank of chief of the guards and then retiring in 1970. After the war, he told stories of military experiences and grew to become a symbol of the Buffalo Soldiers. He met with Bill Clinton and Colin Powell in his later years, and dedicated a barracks in Virginia in honor of the Buffalo Soldiers. Having experienced excellent health for most of his life, Matthews died of pneumonia at the age of 111 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. At the time of his death, he was recognized <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> living Buffalo Soldier as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> man, and the second-oldest person, in the District of Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The Early Woodland {{period in}} Indiana came between 1000 BC and 200 AD and {{produced}} the Adena culture.

5|$|A 2006 FIFA World Cup {{winner and}} UEFA Euro 2000 finalist with Italy, Totti was {{selected}} in the All-Star team for both tournaments; he also represented his country at the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004. He also won several individual awards, notably the 2007 European Golden Shoe and the Golden Foot. In 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100, {{a list of the}} world's greatest living players as selected by Pelé, as part of FIFA's centenary celebrations. In 2011, Totti was recognised by IFFHS as the most popular footballer in Europe. In November 2014, Totti extended his record <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> goalscorer in UEFA Champions League history, aged 38 years and 59 days.|$|E
5|$|A {{high-profile}} shooter, Walsh won numerous tournaments {{within the}} FBI and the Marine Corps, {{as well as}} nationally, and participated in the 1948 Summer Olympics.

At the FBI's 100th anniversary celebration he was recognized <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> living former agent and noted as being a year older than the organization itself. Aside from some hearing and memory loss, he remained physically fit at his 103rd birthday and, in March 2013, became the longest-lived Olympic competitor.|$|E

5|$|According to {{historical}} records, the first spaniel {{was brought to}} North America aboard the Mayflower which sailed from Plymouth, England and landed in New England in 1620. The first Cocker Spaniel recorded in America was a liver and white dog named Captain, who was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1878. In 1881, the American Cocker Spaniel Club was formed; it would later become the American Spaniel Club (ASC) and is now known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> breed club for dogs in the United States. The task of the club was initially to create a standard to separate the Cocker Spaniel in America from other types of land spaniels, a task which would take over 20 years, only being completed in 1905.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{he took on}} {{a variety}} of jobs {{including}} school bus driver, farmer, deacon and cosmetics salesman, the latter of which he performed well past his 100th birthday. He received the Victory Medal, a special medal from the Mississippi National Guard and the French Légion d'honneur. In 1999, the Mississippi Legislature adopted a resolution recognizing him as an outstanding citizen of Mississippi. At the time of his death, at the age of 112, he was recognized <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> combat veteran ever, the oldest male ever recorded in Mississippi and the second-oldest man and World War I veteran in the world.|$|E
5|$|All the Kimberella fossils {{found so}} far are {{assigned}} to one species, K. quadrata. The first specimens were discovered in Australia in 1959. They were originally classified as jellyfish by Martin Glaessner and Mary Wade in 1966, and then as box jellyfish by Wade in 1972, a view that remained popular until the fossils of the White sea region were discovered; these prompted a reinterpretation. Research on these specimens by Mikhail A. Fedonkin, initially with Benjamin M. Waggoner in 1997, led to Kimberella being recognised <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> well-documented triploblastic bilaterian organism — not a jellyfish at all.|$|E

5|$|Another very ancient seat is the {{so-called}} “Chair of Dagobert” in the Louvre. It is of cast bronze, sharpened with the chisel and partially gilt; it is of the curule or faldstool type and supported upon legs terminating in the heads and feet of animals. The seat, which was probably of leather, has disappeared. Its attribution depends entirely upon the statement of Suger, abbot of St Denis in the 12th century, who added a back and arms. Its age has been much discussed, but Viollet-le-Duc dated it to early Merovingian times, and it may in any case be taken <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> faldstool in existence.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> {{parts of}} Monte Testaccio {{are at the}} bottom of the mound, it is {{difficult}} to say with any certainty when it was first created. Deposits found by excavators have been dated to a period between approximately AD 140 to 250, but it is possible that dumping could have begun on the site as early as the 1st century BC. The mound has a roughly triangular shape comprising two distinct platforms, the eastern side being the oldest. At least four distinct series of terraces were built in a stepped arrangement. Layers of small sherds were laid down in some places, possibly to serve as paths for those carrying out the waste disposal operations.|$|E
5|$|His {{abilities}} seemingly in decline, Johnson {{was traded}} to Pittsburgh in 1960, where he had the most productive years of his career, recording two 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He remains the oldest player to record a 1,000-yard rushing season as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> to rush for 200 or more yards in a game. A four-time Pro Bowl selection, Johnson ranked third on the NFL's all-time rushing yards list when he retired, but was best remembered by his peers for the mark he left with his blocking. He {{was elected to the}} Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987.|$|E

5|$|In MN 4, Seorsumuscardinus {{has been}} {{recorded}} from Oberdorf, Austria (sites 3 and 4, which yielded 6 and 17 Seorsumuscardinus alpinus teeth, respectively); Karydia, Greece (S.alpinus); and Tägernaustrasse, Switzerland (5 teeth; S. cf. alpinus). Affalterbach, Germany, where 10 teeth of S.bolligeri were found, is the only known MN 5 locality. In all these localities, {{it is part of}} a diverse dormouse fauna. Because the distributions of the two known species are temporally distinct, Prieto suggested that the genus may be useful for biostratigraphy (the use of fossils to determine the age of deposits). Seorsumuscardinus occurred at the same time <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> known Muscardinus.|$|E
5|$|Matthews {{died at the}} claimed age of 111 of {{pneumonia}} in Washington, D.C.

He was survived by three of his four daughters, his son, nine grandchildren and seventeen great-grandchildren. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in September 2005 and Washington, D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams spoke at his funeral, which was also attended by councilman and future mayor Adrian Fenty.|$|E
5|$|Metcalfe {{received}} only a rudimentary education, and at age sixteen, he was apprenticed {{to his brother}} and learned the craft of stonemasonry.
