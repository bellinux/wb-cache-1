This study also conducts sub-period analysis based on the switching regression technique of Goldfield and Quant (GQSRT) (1972, 1973, and 1976). The main empirical findings are (1) Full-sample results show significant bi-directional linear causality from the CD and CD interest rates for one-month maturities and unidirectional linear causality between the EURO and CD interest rates for three-month and six-month maturities. Furthermore, full-sample results reveal for <b>all</b> three <b>maturities.</b> (2) Sub-sample results based on linear tests show a unidirectional causal relation from the CD rate to the EURO rate during the first sub-period for <b>all</b> three <b>maturities.</b> During the second sub-period, however, linear tests uncover a strong bi-directional relation between the CD and the Euro rates for <b>all</b> three <b>maturities.</b> The linear results for the third sub-period reveal mostly unidirectional causality from the EURO rate to the Cd for three maturities. (3) Finally, sub-sample nonlinear causality tests reveal mostly a unidirectional causality from the CD rate to the EURO rate for <b>all</b> three <b>maturities</b> during the first sub-sample, a strong significant bi-directional causality between the two rates for <b>all</b> three <b>maturities</b> during the second sub-period, and an uneven bi-directional causality between the two rates for <b>all</b> three <b>maturities</b> during the third sub-period.

50|$|In finance, {{bootstrapping}} is {{a method}} for constructing a (zero-coupon) fixed-income yield curve from the prices {{of a set of}} coupon-bearing products, e.g. bonds and swaps.http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bootstrapping.asp A bootstrapped curve, correspondingly, is one where the prices of the instruments used as an input to the curve, will be an exact output, when these same instruments are valued using this curve. Here, the term structure of spot returns is recovered from the bond yields by solving for them recursively, by forward substitution: this iterative process is called the bootstrap method. The usefulness of bootstrapping is that using only a few carefully selected zero-coupon products, it becomes possible to derive par swap rates (forward and spot) for <b>all</b> <b>maturities</b> given the solved curve.|$|E

EEX has offered trading of emission allowances {{on the basis}} of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) since 2005. EEX currently runs a secondary market for continuous trading on a Spot and Derivatives basis for EU ETS allowances (EUA, EUAA) and Kyoto credits (CER, ERU). As of March 26, 2008, it is possible to trade CER Futures on the EEX (Certified Emission Reductions), global emission credits in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. On 14 April 2008 EEX and Eurex launched trading of options on EUA Futures. Since January 2010 EEX AG runs the auctioning of the Emission Allowances issued by the Federal Ministry of the Environment. All trading participants admitted to trading in emission allowances on EEX are able to take part in the auction without any further preconditions regarding licensing. From the very beginning, this also included all trading participants taking part in the existing Eurex cooperation on the Derivatives Market. In addition, EEX also carries out the EUA auctions for further countries (Poland, Hungary). The European Energy Exchange (EEX) has won the tendering procedure for the transitory auctioning platform for the EUA auctioned off by Germany for the third emissions trading period in February 2012 and it was chosen as cooperation exchange for the NER30 program of the European Investment Bank (EIB). As of 30 April 2012, emission allowances for the aviation industry (EU Aviation Allowances - EUAA) will also be offered for trading. Furthermore, Futures on Emission Reduction Units (ERU) will be launched at the end of April. In March, EEX extended the futures on Certified Emission Reductions (CER) for <b>all</b> <b>maturities</b> of the third trading period.|$|E

It is argued that if VIP holds at all under these circumstances, it is only likely to hold at a very short time horizon. Finally, it is shown that under these assumptions, if VIP holds at the shortest time horizon then the difference between forward exchange rates and expected future spot rates at all other horizons will be the difference in expected term premiums at each maturity. ...|$|R

In particular, we observe the strongest bond market response to bad news in the release of non-farm payrolls in expansions. During recessions, inflation news are relatively more important when they contain good news. We also document that macroeconomic news impacts substantially the volatility of bond returns at <b>all</b> <b>maturities</b> by increasing jump intensities and by altering {{the distribution of the}} jump size.

40|$|Understanding the {{relationship}} between monetary policy and market interest rates is of utmost importance to bond traders and central bankers alike. Unanticipated changes in monetary policy strongly affect interest rates of almost <b>all</b> <b>maturities,</b> representing recurrent opportunities for traders to win or lose money. All serious bond analysts have their own quantitative model of the past relationship between policy moves and the yield curve.

Academic economists are interested too: the effect of monetary policy on the real economy is one of our discipline’s more controversial topics. Given these efforts, our understanding of yield curve movements remains remarkably incomplete. True, there are some statistical regularities. It is empirically well established that monetary policy affects market interest rates, and that on average this relationship is positive: an increase in the central-bank rate leads to an increase in interest rates of <b>all</b> <b>maturities.</b> It is also well known, however, that there are many exceptions to the rule.

40|$|Background: Although {{early in}} life there is little {{discernible}} difference in bone mass between boys and girls, at puberty sex differences are observed. It is uncertain if these differences represent differences in bone mass or just differences in anthropometric dimensions. Aim: The study aimed to identify whether sex independently affects bone mineral content (BMC) accrual in growing boys and girls. Three sites are investigated: total body (TB), femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS). Subjects and methods: 85 boys and 67 girls were assessed annually for seven consecutive years. BMC was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Biological age was defined as years from age at peak height velocity (PHV). Data were analysed using a hierarchical (random effects) modelling approach. Results: When biological age, body size and body composition were controlled, boys had statistically significantly higher TB and FN BMC at <b>all</b> <b>maturity</b> levels (p 0. 05). Conclusion: Although a statistical significant sex effect is observed, it {{is less than the}} error of the measurement, and thus sex difference are debatable.

40|$|This paper {{decomposes}} {{monetary policy}} changes into anticipated and unanticipated ones. Then US Treasury rate pass-through {{and the corresponding}} central bank reaction function are analyzed within an asymmetric error-correction framework. Our empirical analysis indicates that changes in policy rate {{have a significant effect}} on Treasury rates in <b>all</b> <b>maturity</b> spectra during periods of anticipated policies only, implying asymmetric transmission. Moreover, some evidence is provided in favor of a nonlinear adjustment toward a long-run equilibrium, as the long-term rates adjust faster in such periods. Impulse response analysis indicates that in periods of low monetary policy anticipation, a shock in long term rates may engage central bank to significant reactions reflected in the policy rate with possible destabilizing effects for the economy. Given that smooth interest rate movements are linked to successful management of the economy more transparent policies are suggested. Our findings can be useful for the US monetary authorities in their attempt to monitor the long-term rate pass-through and reinforce monetary policy effectiveness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
