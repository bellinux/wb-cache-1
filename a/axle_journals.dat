50|$|In 2004 she {{was given}} to the care of the Cornish Steam Locomotive Preservation Society (CSLPS). Before Judy could be moved from Wheal Martyn to their base at Bodmin General railway station a {{specialist}} had to remove the asbestos insulation around the boiler. A £50,000 grant was made from the Heritage Lottery Fund towards her restoration, and the work was supported by both Poltair Community School and the Cornwall Young Archaeologists Club. Part of the firebox had to be renewed, this being the reason it was taken out of service at Par in 1969. One of the four <b>axle</b> <b>journals</b> were found to have suffered water damage while on static display, but otherwise it was in reasonable condition despite not having been in steam for more than 30 years. Heavy and specialised repairs were undertaken by contractors, but much of the work was done at Bodmin by volunteers. The boiler was steamed in June 2008 and she moved under her own power on 31 October 2008 {{for the first time in}} nearly 40 years. Now fitted with a vacuum brake so that she could operate passenger trains, Judy entered service on the Bodmin and Wenford Railway in April 2009.|$|E

The influence on the quantitative effects of the stress-strain state is to be considered. In order to investigate this phenomenon the finite element method with use of the three-dimensional elements and the contact was applied. The problem is important because of the increasing speed of modern passenger vehicles. Additionally, a threat occurs {{not only because of the}} loss of capacity of the axle, but also because of the possibility of slip between the wheel and the <b>axle</b> <b>journal...</b>|$|R

Based on a self-developed micro-WEDM machine tool and adopted thin tungsten wire electrode of 30 µm in diameter, {{a series of}} experiments on micro-electrode array machining are introduced. The relationship between the discharge gap and working area of wire discharge under given voltage is investigated. The examination for micro-girder structure forming process has gone along and the <b>axle</b> <b>journal's</b> minimized width of least micro girder which could not bring on machining flexural thermal deformation has been obtained. The clamping method of work-piece intended for electrode array fabrication is analyzed and a special fixture is designed. The factors affecting forming accuracy are summarized.

5000|$|Baldwin Locomotive Works {{delivered}} five 14"/50 caliber railway guns on trains for the United States Navy during April and May 1918. Each 14"/50 gun [...] {{mounted on}} a 72 ft, 535000 lb rail carriage with four 6-wheel bogies was {{under the command of}} a United States Navy lieutenant with a standard U.S. Army 2-8-0 locomotive, a 10-ton crane car, two armored ammunition cars carrying 25 shells each, two cars carrying the recoil pit foundation materials, two fuel and workshop cars, three berthing cars, a kitchen car, a commissary car, and a medical dispensary car. A sixth locomotive pulled a headquarters car for Rear Admiral Charles Peshall Plunkett, with a machine-shop car, a spare parts car, a berthing car, a kitchen car, a commissary car, and a medical dispensary car. After delivery by ship, these trains were assembled in St. Nazaire in August and fired a total of 782 shells during 25 days on the Western Front at ranges between 27 and 36 km. Each 14 in projectile weighed 1400 lb and was fired at 2800 ft per second. The railway carriages could elevate the guns to 43 degrees, but elevations over 15 degrees required excavation of a pit with room for the gun to recoil and structural steel shoring foundations to prevent caving of the pit sides from recoil forces absorbed by the surrounding soil. The trains moved cautiously because axle loading under the gun barrels was 50330 lb while French railways were designed for a maximum of 39000 lb. These <b>axle</b> <b>journals</b> overheated at speeds of more than 10 km per hour. After reaching its intended firing site and constructing the recoil pit, each gun could fire about two shells per hour. One of these guns was retained after the war as an ammunition test gun at the Dahlgren Weapons Laboratory until all United States battleships with 14"/50 guns were scrapped shortly after World War II. The gun was then placed on display outside the museum at the Washington Navy Yard.|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{environmental}} and health concerns with Electroplated Hard Chrome (EHC), the Hard Chrome Alternatives Team (HCAT) has been working to provide an alternative wear coating for EHC. The US Navy selected Tungsten-Carbide Cobalt (WC- 17 Co) High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) thermal spray coating for this purpose and completed service evaluations on select aircraft components to support the HCAT charter in identifying an alternative wear coating for chrome plating. Other benefits of WC-Co thermal spray coatings over EHC are enhanced corrosion resistance, improved durability, and exceptional wear properties. As part of the HCAT charter and to evaluate HVOF coatings on operational Navy components, the P- 3 aircraft was selected for a service evaluation to determine the coating durability as compared to chrome plating. In April 1999, a VP- 30 P- 3 aircraft was outfitted with a right-hand Main Landing Gear (MLG) shock strut coated with WCCo HYOF thermal spray applied to the piston barrel and four <b>axle</b> <b>journals.</b> The HVOF coating on the piston barrel and <b>axle</b> <b>journals</b> was applied by Southwest United Industries, Inc. This HVOF coated strut assembly has since completed 6, 378 landings. Teardown analysis. for this WC-Co HVOF coated MLG asset is significant in assessing the durability of this wear coating in service relative to EHC and to substantiate Life Cycle Cost (LCC) data to support a retrograde transition from EHC to HVOF thermal spray coatings. Findings from this teardown analysis may also benefit future transitions to HVOF thermal spray coatings by identifying enhancements to finishing techniques, mating bearing and liner material improvements, improved seal materials, and improvements in HVOF coating selection...|$|E
40|$|Railway vehicle axles {{experience}} fatigue behavior. This {{has become}} a critical issue considering both the increased loads and speeds of railway vehicles. The failure of one axle {{has the potential to}} cause derailment of the entire train. Train derailment can cause danger to the public, threaten lives, and cost thousands of dollars in repair and rehabilitation. A critical area is the axle journal. Inspecting <b>axle</b> <b>journals</b> is difficult due to limited accessibility, as the journal and nearby areas are covered by the bearing, bearing cap, and wheel. The main challenge of this research is to overcome the limited accessibility using ultrasonic techniques. Three main railway axle journal inspection concepts have been developed in this research: 1) automated detection system of a cracked axle journal using the ultrasonic phased array technique, 2) detection of a cracked axle journal using a chain scanner, and 3) cracked axle journal detection using surface waves. An ultrasonic phased array system has a much higher probability of detection (POD) and will provide a much more rapid inspection when compared to conventional ultrasonic transducers. Surface wave inspection proves that it can propagate along the complex geometry of the railway axle journal. Support vector machine (SVM) and the developed algorithm successfully distinguished between a cracked axle and an uncracked axle. Signal processing with a threshold classifier was developed to provide a faster computation time. Three different air-coupled experiments are demonstrated: 1) the line-source air-coupled ultrasonic array sensors in through-transmission mode, 2) the point-source air-coupled ultrasonic generation using Rayleigh waves, and 3) the laser array detector on a steel plate. A complete air-coupled ultrasonic system is achieved with the air-coupled 20 -array ultrasonic line source and point source with microphone sensor as receiver. The best results can be obtained with an excitation frequency range of 50 to 100 kHz. The generated ultrasonic waves successfully penetrated the aluminum sheet, the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plate, and the concrete mortar using the through-transmission technique. The one-side non-contact crack detection is demonstrated using a Rayleigh wave. It successfully distinguishes between cracked and uncracked regions using the time-of-flight technique. A complete air-coupled ultrasonic system is developed for various materials in this research...|$|E

[...] The Rail Accident Investigation Branch were called in to conduct a preliminary examination into the incident, and found it to have been caused by the failure due to metal fatigue of an <b>axle</b> <b>journal</b> that had been welded several years previously (when the railway was under different management). Following this accident all wheels of this design were identified by the railway and scrapped, being replaced by new wheelsets, and a new computerised passenger carriage maintenance database was introduced, providing detailed tracking of the service regime of whole carriages, and of individual bogies and axles.|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims at {{systematically}} {{studying the}} possibilities of minimising devastatingconsequences of high-speed derailments by appropriate measures and features in thetrain design, including the running gear. The course of events immediately afterderailments is studied with respect to whether the train stays upright and close to thetrack centre line or deviates laterally with probably serious consequences. There is abelief in the railway community that some trains can better cope with derailment thenothers, although this superiority is apparently hard to quantify. Firstly, an empirical database has been established containing as much relevantinformation as possible of past incidents and accidents occurred at higher speeds due tomechanical failure close to the interface between the running gear and the track, as wellas other causes that ultimately brought the train into a derailed condition. Although nevertwo derailments are the same, certain patterns appeared to crystallise after analysing thecourse of events immediately after the failure based on the descriptions available in eachincident or accident report. Ultimately, this led to that several critical vehicle parameterscould be distinguished as capable to influence {{the outcome of a}} derailment. Secondly, two of the critical vehicle features found in the first stage have been subject todetailed analysis by means of multi-body system (MBS) simulations. The first phase ofthe computer simulation program focused on studying the tendency of a wheelset toderail {{as a result of an}} <b>axle</b> <b>journal</b> failure on the outside of the wheel. The prederailmentcomputer simulation model has been validated with good results for twoauthentic Swedish events of <b>axle</b> <b>journal</b> failure. Thereafter, one of the newly found critical vehicle feature, the wheelset mechanicalrestrictions relative to the bogie frame, have been extensively studied on an X 2000 power unit and trailer car model. The results show that a vertical mechanical restrictionof the wheelset relative to the bogie frame of approximately 50 to 60 mm is capable ofkeeping the wheelsets on the rails after an <b>axle</b> <b>journal</b> failure, for the studied conditions. An axle mounted brake disc constitutes the second critical vehicle feature that has thepotential to favourably influence the sequence of events in cases of wheel flangeclimbing. A minimal range of geometrical parameters for which the rail would safely fillthe gap between the brake disc and the wheel has been calculated. The third and last part of the thesis establishes the prerequisites necessary in order tostudy the remaining of the critical vehicle parameters found in the first part, whichrequires complete MBS simulations of derailed vehicles rolling on track structures, i. e. concrete sleepers. To accomplish this task, hysteresis data for the force as function ofconcrete material indentation, are aimed to be acquired by means of finite element (FE) simulations. Therefore, the intended FE model of wheel-concrete sleeper impact issubjected to a tentative validation procedure. A good agreement is observed whencomparing the FE model results with an authentic accident in terms of concrete sleeperindentation. Furthermore, preliminary results in terms of a wheelset tendency to reboundafter concrete sleeper impact are presented. QC 2010112...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Due {{to great}} {{pressure}} difference between inlet and outlet, high-pressure gear pump can cause unbalanced radial force, {{which results in}} serious wearing between <b>axle</b> <b>journal</b> of drive shaft and bearing-hole, non-ideal dynamic characteristics, and drop of volumetric efficiency after long run.

Based on this structure, a high-pressure oil reservoir is {{installed on the wall}} of the inner-hole of floating plate for radial support and lubricating, which can effectively reduce shaft wearing and noise, and improve working dynamic characteristics of high-pressure gear pump. Nowadays pure water hydraulic transmission has received wide emphasis and large amounts of exploration and research have been conducted on it. As an important research area, water hydraulic transmission utilizes kinds of components which are green products due to the advantages of security, non- pollution, and oil-saving,.

40|$|The {{development}} of a tool called the Service Load Factor (SLF) for railway tapered roller bearings using residual stress and retained austenite data is presented. Case-carburized tapered roller bearings used in the railroad industry are manufactured with a dual-phase microstructure that consists primarily of tempered martensite and retained austenite. The retained austenite phase is metastable, and will transform to martensite with sufficient thermal or mechanical energy during service. The increase in surface volume because of transformation, and the subsequent increase in compressive residual stress could indicate the onset of certain failure modes, including fatigue spalling. In addition, retained austenite transformation can {{lead to an increase}} in bore diameter, which could result in a loss of fit on the <b>axle</b> <b>journal.</b> Several bearing inner races with various service histories were measured with a Siemens X-ray diffractometer using chromium radiation. Results indicated that the transformation of retained austenite and resultant increase in compressive residual stress are interrelated with load and rolling cycles. Results indicate that the SLF is a useful tool that correlates well with current Association of American Railroads (AAR) failure criteria...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims at {{systematically}} {{studying the}} possibilities of minimizing devastating consequences of high-speed rail vehicle derailments by appropriate measures and features in the train design including the running gear. Firstly, an empirical database is established containing as much relevant information as possible of past incidents and accidents that have occurred at substantial running speeds due to mechanical failure close to the interface between the running gear and the track. Other causes that ultimately brought the train in a derailed condition are also covered. Although various accidental circumstances make each derailment a unique event, certain patterns appear to emerge which lead to several critical vehicle parameters capable of influencing {{the outcome of a}} derailment or preventing a derailment to occur. Secondly, the possibility of preventing wheel climbing derailments after an <b>axle</b> <b>journal</b> failure is studied by implementing mechanical restrictions between wheelsets and bogie frame. In this respect, a multi body system (MBS) computer model is developed to account for such an axle failure condition, which is successfully validated on the basis of two authentic passenger car events. In order to study the overall post-derailment vehicle behaviour, in particular the wheelsets’ vertical motion and lateral deviation on sleepers, a comprehensive MBS post-derailment module is developed and implemented in the commercially available software GENSYS. The model detects wheel-sleeper impact conditions and applies valid force resultants calculated through linear interpolation based on a pre-defined look-up table. The table was constructed through exhaustive finite element (FE) wheel to concrete sleeper impact simulations utilising the commercially available software LS-DYNA. The MBS post-derailment module has been validated successfully in several stages, including a correct prediction of the derailing wheelset’s trajectory over ten consecutive sleepers in comparison with an authentic passenger vehicle derailment event. An extensive simulation analysis on the feasibility of utilizing alternative substitute guidance mechanisms attached to the running gear on rail vehicles is presented, as means of minimizing the lateral deviation. Three low-reaching guidance mechanisms attached onto the running gear (bogie frame, brake disc and <b>axle</b> <b>journal</b> box) are analysed in terms of geometrical parameters for a successful engagement with the rail in order to prevent large lateral deviations after twelve different derailment scenarios. Three conventional coupled passenger trailing cars are investigated in terms of lateral deviation and vehicle overturning tendency after derailments on tangent and curved track. This is performed as a function of various vehicle design features and parameters such as: maximum centre coupler yaw angle, carbody height of centre of gravity, coupler height and additional running gear features. In a similar manner, the articulated train concept is investigated in terms of the post-derailment vehicle behaviour as a function of different inter-carbody damper characteristics and running gear features.

50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{are used}} on the ICF bogies. These bearings are press fitted on the <b>axle</b> <b>journal</b> by heating the bearings at a temperature of 80 to 100 °C in an induction furnace. Before fitting the roller bearing, an axle collar is press fitted. The collar ensures that the bearing does not move towards {{the center of the}} axle. After pressing the collar, a rear cover for the axle box is fitted. The rear cover has two main grooves. In one of the grooves, a nitrile rubber sealing ring is placed. The sealing ring ensures that the grease in the axle box housing does not seep out during the running of the wheels. A woolen felt ring is placed in another groove. After the rear cover, a retaining ring is placed. The retaining ring is made of steel and is a press fit. The retaining ring ensures that the rear cover assembly is secured tightly between the axle collar and the retaining ring and stays at one place. The roller bearing is pressed after the retraining ring. Earlier, the collar and the bearings were heated in an oil bath. But now the practices has been discontinued and an induction furnace is used to heat them before fitting on the axle. The axle box housing, which is a steel casting, is then placed on the axle. The bearing is housed in the axle box housing. Axle box grease is filled in the axle box housing. Each axle box housing is filled with approximately 2.5 kg. of grease. The front cover for the axle box is placed on a housing which closes the axle box. The front cover is bolted by using torque wrench.|$|R
