5|$|The abbey {{was founded}} in the late twelfth century <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> for monks of the austere Cistercian order. Over its 350-year monastic history Cleeve was undistinguished amongst the abbeys of its order, {{frequently}} ill-governed and often financially troubled. The sole {{member of the community}} to achieve prominence was John Hooper, who became a bishop during the Reformation.|$|E
5|$|Virtual cameras {{have been}} {{developed}} which allow a director to film motion capture and view the digital characters movements in real time in a pre-constructed digital environment, such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> or spaceship. Resident Evil 5 was the first video game to use the technology, which was developed for the 2009 film Avatar.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating in}} 1933, {{he entered the}} medical program at the University of Melbourne. His mentors {{included}} Anatomy Professor Frederic Wood Jones. While at the University, he passed the primary exam for the Royal College of Surgeons in 1934, one of only four successful candidates who sat the examination in Melbourne that year. He finished the program in 1937 and received an MBBS with honours {{as well as two}} prizes in surgery. After graduation, he studied internal medicine for one more year, and served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> surgeon at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Woodruff then started his surgical training.|$|E
5|$|Drawn and Quarterly {{has become}} known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> for art comics, {{translations}} of non-English works, like Montrealer Michel Rabagliati's Paul series, and archive editions of classic comics, such as Wright's Little Nipper. The publisher has earned a reputation for the special attention they put into book design, and has played a pivotal rôle in shaping comics' rise in artistic prominence, and in getting comics into mainstream book stores in both Canada and the US. D publisher Chris Oliveros, along with Art Spiegelman, lobbied bookstores to include a section for graphic novels, which would be subdivided by subject.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, Sir Walter Scott's novel Ivanhoe {{featured}} a scene involving a tournament at Ashby de la Zouch Castle; the novel was immensely popular {{and made the}} location famous. Edward Mammatt, Francis Rawdon's agent, repaired the castle ruins and opened them to visitors, whom Rawdon hoped to attract to the Ivanhoe Baths which he opened nearby. Ashby Place, which had become used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>House</b> of Industry, was pulled down in 1830 and a new house, Ashby Manor, was built in its place. Work continued throughout the 19th century to repair the castle ruins, although they remained mostly covered in ivy.|$|E
50|$|Garrowhill was {{developed}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> residential {{area in the}} mid-1930s, built <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>housing</b> development neighbouring the then village of Baillieston.|$|R

25|$|The {{bank was}} opened in 1975, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>housing</b> finance {{institution}} <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> real estate developer. HBR was registered <b>as</b> <b>a</b> limited liability company. On 2 July 2004, the National Bank of Rwanda, the country's Central Bank, granted HBR a Provisional License to operate <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Housing</b> Bank. The license was contingent upon the institution raising its share capital to the minimum of US$2.65 million, {{to comply with}} then current banking laws in Rwanda.|$|R
5|$|In 1962, {{the trust}} {{successfully}} lobbied {{for the house}} to become a national historic landmark. In 1972, the Trust donated the property to the National Park Service and it became the Longfellow National Historic Site {{and open to the}} public <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> museum. On display are many of the original nineteenth century furnishings, artwork, over 10,000 books owned by Longfellow, and the dining table around which many important visitors gathered. Everything on display was owned by the Longfellow family. The site was renamed to Longfellow House–Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site on December 22, 2010, to ensure that the connection to Washington was not lost in the memory of the general public.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years at Lancing, Waugh {{achieved}} success <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> captain, editor of the school magazine {{and president of the}} debating society, and won numerous art and literature prizes. He also shed most of his religious beliefs. He started a novel of school life, untitled, but abandoned the effort after writing about around 5,000 words. He ended his schooldays by winning a scholarship to read Modern History at Hertford College, Oxford, and left Lancing in December 1921.|$|E
5|$|In most Dragon Quest games, players must visit {{a church}} (known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>House</b> of Healing in the NES translations) {{and talk to}} a priest or nun to save the games' progress; in Dragon Warrior, players {{had to talk to}} a king to save their progress, though the first two Dragon Quest titles for Famicom use a {{password}} save system. If the party dies in battle the group loses half of its gold and warps to the nearest save location where the hero is revived; players must then pay a priest or nun to revive their party members.|$|E

5|$|Many {{paintings}} can {{be found}} in the museums of Europe depicting tulips with attractive coloured stripes. Most, such as the still life studies of Johannes Bosschaert, were painted during the 17th century. These flowers were particularly popular and became sought after by those who could afford them. At the peak of this tulip mania in the 1630s, one bulb could cost as much <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>house.</b> It was not known at the time that the stripes were caused by a virus accidentally transferred by humans to tulips from jasmine. Weakened by the virus, the plants turned out to be a poor investment. Only a few bulbs produced flowers with the attractive characteristics of their parent plants.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the town}} was {{destroyed}} by fire in 1577. After this time the town was largely rebuilt including Waterloo House and Manor Court House in Fore Street which were built <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> and courtroom, and have now been converted into shops and offices. Further damage to the town {{took place during the}} English Civil War with both sides plundering its resources, particularly in 1644 when Charles I spent a week in the town.|$|E
5|$|The American robin has a {{place in}} Native American mythology. The {{story of how the}} robin got its red breast by fanning the dying flames of a campfire to save a Native American man and a boy is similar to those that {{surround}} the European robin. The Tlingit people of Northwestern North America held it to be a culture hero created by Raven to please the people with its song. One of the houses of the Raven Tribe from the Nisga'a Nation holds the robin <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> crest.|$|E

5|$|Virginia House {{was built}} by Alexander and Virginia Weddell, {{salvaging}} many materials from the Priory and other old English manor houses and adding further elegant English and Spanish antiques, oriental carpets, silks, and silver. Today Virginia House is operated by the Virginia Historical Society <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> museum, although it largely remains {{as it was in}} the 1940s during the Weddells’ tenancy. Immediately to the west of the property is Agecroft Hall.|$|E
5|$|When Pearson bent {{the frame}} of his own race car early in the 1961 season, he began working <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> roofer in Spartanburg to support his family, which {{included}} two sons. Darel Dieringer had a contract dispute with a tire company and {{was not able to}} compete in the inaugural World 600 at Charlotte. Littlejohn was at the track, and he recommended that car builder Ray Fox hire Pearson. Pearson was unsure if he should join the team, and Fox was not convinced that he should trust his car to the relatively untested 26-year-old driver.|$|E
5|$|A fire {{swept through}} Westminster in 1834, {{destroying}} {{most of the}} old palace, but the Jewel Tower, which was separated from the main fire and was positioned away from the prevailing wind, survived, along with its store of records from the House of Lords. Westminster was rebuilt, and in 1864 substantial changes were made at the tower: the Parliamentary records in the tower were moved to a fire-proof storage facility at the new Victoria Tower; 6–7 Old Palace Yard ceased {{to be used by}} the clerk <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>house,</b> and the kitchen in the ground floor of the tower was closed. Around this time, the tower began to be called the Jewel Tower once again, partially in the incorrect belief that it had held the Crown Jewels during the medieval period.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of George IV in 1830, a {{decision}} was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until {{the death of}} Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.|$|E
5|$|Borobudur differs {{markedly}} {{from the}} general design of other structures built for this purpose. Instead of being built on a flat surface, Borobudur is built on a natural hill. However, construction technique is similar to other temples in Java. Without the inner spaces seen in other temples, and with a general design similar {{to the shape of}} pyramid, Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a stupa, instead of a temple. A stupa is intended as a shrine for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> of worship. The meticulous complexity of the monument's design suggests that Borobudur is in fact a temple.|$|E
5|$|Chesney was {{a builder}} in his diocese, where {{he ordered the}} {{construction}} of the episcopal palace. He also founded a Gilbertine house of canons just outside the city of Lincoln, the priory of St Catherine, shortly after the order was recognised by the papacy in 1148. Unusually for its time it was only founded for men, although Gilbertine monastic houses typically accommodated both men and women. In 1161 he bought the Old Temple in London <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> for himself. These expenditures contributed to his financial difficulties, along with royal demands, which led to complaints about Chesney's spending. Another cause for complaint was that he gave away some of his estates as marriage portions for his nieces. Chesney also was a benefactor to the town of Banbury, to which he granted the right to hold a fair some time before 1154.|$|E
50|$|In the 90s, Díaz {{started working}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>housing</b> {{inspector}} {{for the city}} of Cayey. After that, he worked as Director of Public Works for Cayey.|$|R

50|$|Holkham {{station has}} been demolished, {{although}} the WW2 pill boxes remain. The site of Docking station has been redeveloped <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>housing</b> estate, although the station <b>house</b> survives <b>as</b> <b>a</b> private residence, and the route into Wells-next-the-Sea has been partially redeveloped <b>as</b> <b>housing,</b> <b>a</b> school playing field and an industrial estate.|$|R
