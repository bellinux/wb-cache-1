5|$|The American {{rock band}} Paramore has {{released}} five studio albums, three extended plays, two live albums, eighteen singles, one video album, and nineteen music videos. The band {{was formed in}} Franklin, Tennessee, in 2004 by lead vocalist Hayley Williams with guitarists Josh Farro and Taylor York, bassist Jeremy Davis, and drummer Zac Farro. In 2005, Paramore signed with the New York City-based Fueled by Ramen and released their debut album entitled <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling. Three singles were released from the album, {{but none of them}} charted. The album did not chart in the Billboard 200 either, although it peaked at number thirty in the Billboard Top Heatseekers. <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling received Gold certification in the United Kingdom and in July 2014 the RIAA certified the album Gold in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|The track listing and artwork for ...Honor Is <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>were</b> {{revealed}} on September 28, 2014, {{and on the}} day after, Rancid {{announced that}} the album would be released on October 27, 2014. Armstrong originally recorded the title track {{as part of his}} side project Tim Timebomb.|$|R
500|$|Initially, <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling only charted on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, peaking {{at number}} 30 in September 2006. After {{the success of}} their second studio album Riot! (2007), the album sales {{gradually}} built. Although it never charted on Billboard 200, it did manage to take number eight on the Billboard Catalog Albums chart in 2009. <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling only reached number 51 on the UK Albums Chart, but still received gold certification in 2009 by the British Phonographic Industry for shipping over 100,000 copies. It was then certified in Australia in 2012, where it went gold for shipments of over 35,000 units despite never reaching an Australian chart. In 2014, the album was certified gold in the United States for shipments of over 500,000 copies. Initially, none of the singles managed to chart, but after the success of Riot!, [...] "Pressure" [...] was able to peak at number 62 on the Billboard Digital Songs chart. In 2016, the recording was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).|$|E
500|$|Typically, Farro {{would write}} the music while Williams wrote the lyrics. On occasion, Farro would {{contribute}} lyrics as well. [...] "Conspiracy" [...] was composed by Williams, Farro, and Taylor York. It {{was the first}} song they wrote together. Many of the lyrics in <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling which {{are not related to}} Davis' departure deal with the bad relationship and divorce of Williams' parents. The band's influences varied in sound during the album's recording. Williams claimed influence from metal bands Underoath and Failure, and from pop rock band The Academy Is... Davis said the band were heavily influenced by Slipknot.|$|E
500|$|<b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Paramore, {{released}} on July 26, 2005 under the Atlantic-distributed Fueled by Ramen in the United States. The production {{was led by}} James Paul Wisner, Mike Green, Nick Trevisick, and Roger Alan Nichols. All songs were written by vocalist Hayley Williams and guitarist Josh Farro. The departure of bassist Jeremy Davis, which occurred {{a few days after}} arriving in Orlando, served as the album's main theme. This theme was reflected especially in the album's cover and title. Mostly categorized as a pop punk album, the album received mostly positive reviews and has been labeled a [...] "scene classic".|$|E

500|$|Hayley Williams was {{originally}} signed to Atlantic Records in 2003 {{as a solo}} pop singer. However, Williams resisted the label's solo-career wishes, saying she did not envision herself as [...] "the next Madonna". As a result, she formed Paramore with Josh Farro, Zac Farro, and Jeremy Davis. In her short solo career, Williams recorded some demos, which were later re-recorded with the band for a [...] "more authentic" [...] sound. However, the band was almost fired because the label thought they [...] "were terrible." [...] Williams and Farro wrote two new songs, [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] and [...] "Hallelujah", which saved the group from being fired. The former song became the fifth track on <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling, while [...] "Hallelujah" [...] was saved for their sophomore album Riot! (2007).|$|E
500|$|Critics have {{variously}} called <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling a pop punk, emo, or pop rock album. Trevor Kelley at Alternative Press categorized {{the music}} on the album as [...] "vaguely emo, but mostly mall-punk". Tom Whitson of Click Music defined {{the music on}} the album as emo with [...] "pop-punk beats", drawing comparisons from Avril Lavigne and Fall Out Boy. The Allmusic Neil Z. Yeung referred to the album as a [...] "formulaic" [...] pop punk album, complete with [...] "head-bobbing drums, straightforward riffs, and a midtempo sameness throughout". In a retrospective Alternative Press review by Tyler Sharp, the album {{was referred to as}} what would have been [...] "just another pop-rock effort that ultimately fell short in the face of its true potential" [...] if not for the band's later success. Gigwise reviewer David Renshaw also drew comparisons to Lavigne, but believed that the songs on the album were inferior to that of Lavigne's.|$|E
500|$|<b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling was {{met with}} {{generally}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Kelley stated [...] "it's obvious that someone has done Williams wrong" [...] from the lyrics in the album's the songs, and noted its similarity to Lavigne's previous studio album Under My Skin (2004). Tony Pascarella of The Trades said that [...] "these passionate, rocking tracks are what make this Tennessee group so talented [...] Paramore is a band you may not yet have heard of, but look {{for them to make}} a major splash in the very near future." [...] He also praised Williams' voice as [...] "a rich, powerful voice that rarely makes a mistake on this stunning debut." [...] BuzzFeed included the album at number 13 on their [...] "36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F——ing Die" [...] list. In a tenth-anniversary review from Alternative Press, Tyler Sharp wrote that the album evolved into [...] "a scene classic" [...] after the band's gradual rise to mainstream popularity in later years.|$|E

According to Wheeler, they wrote the song at a time [...] "when we were at our wits' end wondering if we were ever going to get to make a second record. Our manager and our guy just kept saying, 'Keep writing, keep writing.' <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was,</b> hey, man, <b>we</b> wrote 11 songs and that's <b>all</b> <b>we</b> had to our name when we made the first record." ...|$|R

500|$|The album's {{production}} {{took place}} in Orlando, Florida. Instead of making a major push towards radio, the band's A recommended that the band build a fanbase through word of mouth. Initially, the album received mixed reviews by music critics, who however praised the voice of Hayley Williams. The album had a weak domestic commercial performance: it failed to enter the Billboard 200, though it did reach number 30 on Billboards Heatseekers Chart. It reached No. 4 on the UK Rock Chart, and in 2010 it managed to reach No. 51 on the UK Albums Chart and earned a gold certification by the BPI. In July 2014, after the group found success with its following records, <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling received gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Three singles from the album were released: [...] "Pressure", [...] "Emergency" [...] and [...] "All We Know". None of the singles managed to reach any major chart, although [...] "Pressure" [...] was certified gold by the RIAA in 2016 after the band found commercial success with subsequent releases.|$|E
500|$|Paramore {{released}} <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling on July 26, 2005 in the United States. According to Paramore's A at Atlantic Records, Steve Robertson, {{the promotion}} strategy behind {{the album was}} that the band would start small and slowly build through word of mouth instead of giving the debut album a major radio promotional push. In his own words, Robertson [...] "wanted kids to discover the band without it being shoved down their throats." [...] In September 2005, a special Japanese edition containing a previously unreleased song [...] "O Star" [...] was made available. In January 2009, the album was released on vinyl for the first time. On May 19, 2009, a deluxe edition of the album was released exclusively on iTunes with live versions of [...] "Pressure" [...] and [...] "Here We Go Again", and the music videos for all the singles. A 10th anniversary edition of the album was released on December 4, 2015 on vinyl, which contains [...] "O Star" [...] and [...] "This Circle" [...] as bonus tracks; this version was limited to 4,000 copies. The album featured three singles: [...] "Pressure", [...] "Emergency" [...] and [...] "All We Know".|$|E
500|$|Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe listed [...] "The Only Exception" [...] as the {{highlight}} of Brand New Eyes, crediting the song as being an [...] "essential". Hirsh said that [...] "The Only Exception" [...] is [...] "probably {{the best place to}} start" [...] with the album, describing Williams' vocals as [...] "forging a connection" [...] rather than [...] "simply spitting out her feelings"; he also praised the other band members for locking in at a [...] "sympathetic simmer". Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic felt that [...] "The Only Exception" [...] had similarities to [...] "The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot" [...] by Brand New. Freeman stated that on Paramore's <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling, [...] "My Heart" [...] was a [...] "blunt and obvious song" [...] that focused on a [...] "climax to be emotional", but with [...] "The Only Exception", Paramore have [...] "figured out that it doesn't have to finish loud to incite a reaction in the listener". He also noted that the song shows that Williams' lyrics have [...] "definitely improved". Jesse Catalodo of Slant felt that the lyrics to [...] "The Only Exception" [...] may be [...] "irredeemably over-the-top" [...] but its [...] "vocal melodies are the stuff of perfect pop".|$|E
5000|$|Designer Randy Breen recounted, [...] "Initially <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> that <b>we</b> wanted Road Rash {{to be more}} of an {{entertaining}} game than a pure driving simulation. I'd been into motorcycles for a long time, and we quickly realized bikes gave us lots of technical advantages. For instance, we could put more bikes than cars onscreen at once, and the bikers were more visible than car drivers, so they could be more expressive." [...] The fighting element of the game was inspired by the behavior of Grand Prix motorcyclists, who Breen noticed would sometimes shove and kick each other during races.|$|R

The trek before us, although not so very long, was of an extremely perilous nature. We had to pass through about two hundred miles of country of which <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> that its inhabitants were the Amatonga and other savage tribes. Here I should explain that after much discussion we had abandoned the idea of retracing the route followed by Marais on his ill-fated journey towards Delagoa.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she went}} to a low place in the wall and stood there as though she were {{considering}} the scene beyond. It seemed to us, indeed, that she saw what she had not expected and was thereby perplexed or angered. Presently she appeared to make up her mind, for again she motioned to us to remain where we were, enjoining silence upon us by placing her swathed hand upon the mask that hid her face. Next moment she was gone. How she went, or whither, I cannot say; <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> that she was no longer there.|$|R
2500|$|Paramore {{traveled}} back to Orlando, Florida, but {{shortly after}} arriving, Jeremy Davis left the band, citing personal reasons. The remaining {{four members of}} Paramore continued with the album, writing [...] "All We Know" [...] about his departure, and later deciding to base <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling around the concept. The album artwork also reflected Paramore's grief as Hayley Williams explains, [...] "The couch {{on the cover of}} <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>is</b> Falling with no one there and the shadow walking away; it's all about Jeremy leaving us and us feeling like there's an empty space." ...|$|E
2500|$|The group {{released}} its debut album <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling in 2005, with the album reaching number eight on the UK Rock Chart and number thirty on Billboards Heatseekers Chart. While it {{only had a}} minimal commercial performance initially, the album and its lead single [...] "Pressure" [...] were eventually certified Gold by the RIAA after {{the success of the}} band's later material.|$|E
2500|$|Before touring, {{the band}} added John Hembree (bass) to their lineup to replace Davis. During that summer, Paramore was {{featured}} on the Shira Girl stage of the 2005 Warped Tour. After being asked by the band, Jeremy Davis returned to Paramore after five months apart, replacing Hembree. <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling was released on July 24, 2005, and reached No.30 on the Billboard's Heatseekers Chart. Paramore released [...] "Pressure" [...] as its first single, with a video directed by Shane Drake, but the song failed to chart. The video featured the band performing in a warehouse, eventually getting sprayed with water sprinklers as the storyline of a conflicted couple occurs. In July, [...] "Emergency" [...] was released as the second single, the video again reuniting the band with director Shane Drake and featuring Hunter Lamb (rhythm guitar), who replaced Jason Bynum in December 2005. The video for [...] "Emergency" [...] showcased Paramore in another performance, this time fixing the members' bloody costumes. The third single, [...] "All We Know", was released with limited airtime, with the video consisting {{of a collection of}} live performances and backstage footage. After the band's later success, <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling and [...] "Pressure" [...] were certified Gold by the RIAA.|$|E

2500|$|Paramore's music {{style has}} {{generally}} been regarded as alternative rock, pop punk, pop rock, power pop, emo pop, and emo. Joshua Martin had written after an interview with Hayley Williams, [...] "The band isn't just a short pop-punk girl with red hair and a spunky attitude. Their music is like them, it's aged differently. It's sped up, and slowed down. It's emo without being whiny, or bratty. Almost a very literal anti-Avril Lavigne." [...] Alternative Press magazine had commented that the band was [...] "young sounding", while consistently being [...] "honest." [...] Paramore's first album <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>is</b> Falling had an arguably more [...] "formulaic pop-punk" [...] sound that was [...] "delivered particularly well" [...] and {{the combination of the}} two had created a [...] "refined rock infused pop/punk album." [...] The band's second release, Riot! was said to explore a 'diverse range of styles," [...] however, not straying far from [...] "their signature sound." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thallus, of whom {{very little}} is known, and none of whose {{writings}} survive, wrote a history allegedly around the middle to late first century CE, to which Eusebius referred. Julius Africanus, writing c 221, links a reference in the third book of the History to the period of darkness described in the crucifixion accounts {{in three of the}} Gospels [...] It is not known whether Thallus made any mention to the crucifixion accounts; if he did, it would be the earliest noncanonical reference to a gospel episode, but its usefulness in determining the historicity of Jesus is uncertain. The dating of Thallus is dependent on him writing about an event during the 207th Olympiad (49-52 AD), which means he wrote after that date, not near that date. This depends on the text being corrupt, which would mean Thallus could have been writing after the 217th Olympiad (89-92 AD), or even the 167th Olympiad (112-109 BC). He is first referenced by Theophilus, writing around 180 AD, which means Thallus could have written any time between 109 BC and 180 AD. [...] <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> Thallus mentioned a solar eclipse, and as solar eclipses are not possible at Passover, that would mean Thallus was not talking about the crucifixion of Jesus at all.|$|E
2500|$|Reading the First Meditation as {{an effort}} to coax Aristotelians away from their {{customary}} opinions allows us to read different interpretations into the different stages of doubt. For instance, there is some debate as to whether Descartes intended his famous [...] "Dream Argument" [...] to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming—that though there is waking experience, I can never know which moments are dreams and which are waking—or the possibility of a universal dream—that my whole life is a dream and that there is no waking world. If we read Descartes as suggesting the universal possibility of dreaming, we can explain an important distinction between the Dream Argument and the later [...] "Evil Demon Argument". The latter suggests that <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> false and that we cannot trust the senses one bit. The Dream Argument, if meant to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming, suggests only that the senses are not always and wholly reliable. The Dream Argument questions Aristotelian epistemology, while the Evil Demon Argument does away with it altogether. The Painter's Analogy, which draws on the Dream Argument, concludes that mathematics and other purely cerebral studies are far more certain than astronomy or physics, which is an important step away from the Aristotelian reliance on the senses and toward Cartesian rationalism.|$|E
