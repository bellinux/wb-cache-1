40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{describe}} clinical {{characteristics and}} lateralizing value of peri-ictal electrode manipulation automatism (EMA) {{in patients with}} temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and compare our data with ictal manual automatisms described in the literature. MethodsTwo-hundred and five videotaped seizures of 55 consecutive patients with refractory TLE and postoperatively seizure-free outcome were analyzed and EMA (tugging, scratching or <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> and cables) were monitored. ResultsTwenty-eight (51 %) patients showed EMA during 47 (23 %) seizures. Ictal start was noted in 22 seizures and in 19 / 22 cases EMA finished {{before the end of}} seizure. Ictal EMAs were always associated with automotor seizure components. During 25 seizures, exclusively postictal EMAs were observed. Electrode manipulation was presented during 24 / 112 left-sided and 23 / 93 right-sided seizures (p= 0. 742). Peri-ictal EMA was unilateral (completed by one hand) in 24 / 47 seizures (10 ictal, 14 postictal); it was done by the hand ipsilateral to the seizure onset zone in 17 / 24 and by contralateral hand in 7 / 24 cases (p= 0. 064). We observed concomitant contralateral dystonic posturing during 3 / 10 seizures with unilateral ictal EMA. Unilateral hand automatism, temporally independent from the EMA appeared in 30 (64 %) of the 47 seizures. ConclusionPeri-ictal EMA is a frequent phenomenon but shows no lateralizing value in TLE. The mechanism of EMA is in many ways dissimilar from that of earlier described manual automatisms...|$|E

40|$|Symmetric {{electric}} double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) {{have equal}} {{masses of the}} same active material in both electrodes. However, having equal electrode masses may prevent the EDLC to have the largest possible specific capacitance if the sizes of the hydrated anions and cations in the electrolyte differ because <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> and <b>the</b> electrolyte may not be completely utilized. Here we demonstrate how this issue can be resolved by mass balancing. If <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> masses are <b>adjusted</b> according to <b>the</b> size of the ions, one can easily increase an EDLC's specific capacitance. To that end, we performed galvanostatic cycling to measure the capacitances of symmetric EDLCs with different electrode mass ratios using four aqueous electrolytes- Na 2 SO 4, H 2 SO 4, NaOH, and KOH (all with a concentration of 1 M) -and compared these to <b>the</b> theoretical optimal <b>electrode</b> mass ratio that we calculated using the sizes of the hydrated ions. Both the theoretical and experimental values revealed lower-than- 1 optimal electrode ratios for all electrolytes except KOH.

Our findings demonstrate that electrode mass balancing is a simple and inexpensive method to increase the capacitance of EDLCs.
