5|$|Shelley {{began writing}} fiction late in life, {{publishing}} {{his first novel}} The Shrimp People in 1991 {{at the age of}} sixty one. The first substantial novel by a Singaporean writer about the Eurasian community in Singapore, it was the best-selling local paperback at the Times bookshop for three consecutive weeks between 22 August and 5 September 1991, and remained in the top five until 11 December that year. The work won the National Book Development Council of Singapore Award for works in English the following year despite being up against books by established writers such as Gopal Baratham and Suchen Christine Lim. He wrote three more books, People of the Pear Tree (1993), Island in the Centre (1995) and <b>A</b> <b>River</b> <b>of</b> Roses (1998), on the same theme within a decade. The first two of these won National Book Development Council Highly Commended Awards in 1994 and 1996 respectively, while the last won the Dymocks Singapore Literature Prize (now known simply as the Singapore Literature Prize) in 2000.|$|E

25|$|The two river {{catchments}} {{have very}} different natures. While the open Manawatu Plains became more densely settled by Europeans, inland Ruapehu, Rangitikei and Whanganui remained more Māori-dominated, remote and independent, and is still heavily forested. As late as the 1950s the Whanganui River remained <b>a</b> <b>river</b> <b>of</b> mystery. Since then exploitation of the river's commercial potential has opened up the area, often causing friction with local Māori, who have long-standing grievances.

500|$|In the 1940s, Marjory Stoneman Douglas, a {{freelance}} writer and former reporter for The Miami Herald, [...] began to research the Everglades for an assignment about the Miami River. She studied the land and water for five years, and published [...] in 1947, describing the area in great detail, including a chapter on its disappearance. She wrote: [...] "What had been <b>a</b> <b>river</b> <b>of</b> grass and sweet water that had given meaning and life and uniqueness to this enormous geography through centuries in which man had no place here was made, in one chaotic gesture of greed and ignorance and folly, <b>a</b> <b>river</b> <b>of</b> fire." [...] The book has sold 500,000 copies since its publication, and Douglas' continued dedication to ecology conservation earned her the nicknames [...] "Grand Dame of the Everglades", [...] "Grandmother of the Everglades" [...] and [...] "the anti-Christ" [...] for her singular focus at the expense of some political interests. She founded and served as president for an organization called Friends of the Everglades, initially intended to protest the construction of a proposed Big Cypress jetport in 1968. Successful in that confrontation, the organization has grown to over 4,000 members, committed to the preservation of the Everglades. She wrote and spoke {{about the importance of the}} Everglades until her death at age 108 in 1998.|$|E

[...] Las Casas' campaign led to an official end of the enslavement of Tainos in 1542—however it was replaced by the African slave trade. [...] As Las Casas had presaged, the Spaniards' treatment of the Tainos was the start of a centuries-long legacy of slavery in which abuse such as amputating body parts was commonplace.|$|E

500|$|Early in the 1940s Douglas was {{approached}} by a publisher {{to contribute to the}} Rivers of America Series by writing about the Miami River. Unimpressed with it, she called the Miami River about [...] "an inch long", but in researching it became more interested in the Everglades and persuaded the publisher instead to allow her to write about them. She spent five years researching what little scientific knowledge was recorded about the ecology and history of the Everglades and South Florida. Douglas spent time with geologist Garald Parker, who discovered that all of South Florida's fresh water source was the Biscayne Aquifer, and it was filled by the Everglades. Parker confirmed the name of the book that has since become the nickname for the Everglades when Douglas, trying to capture the essence of the Everglades, asked if she could safely call the fresh water flowing from Lake Okeechobee <b>a</b> <b>river</b> <b>of</b> grass.|$|E

500|$|Asturias employs figurative {{language}} to describe dream imagery and the irrational. Literary critic Hughes Davies {{points out that}} Asturias frequently appeals to the reader's auditory senses. Asturias's often incantatory style employs [...] "unadulterated poetry to reinforce his imagery through sound". This helps readers to understand the physical {{as well as the}} psychological aspects of the novel. According to Knightly, [...] "few of Asturias's characters have much psychological depth; their inner conflicts tend to be externalized and played out at the archetypal level". More significantly, Asturias was the first Latin American novelist to combine stream of consciousness writing and {{figurative language}}. Hughes Davies argues that from the outset of , the gap between words and reality is exemplified through onomatopoeia, simile and repetition of phrases. Knightly notes that [...] "animistic elements surface occasionally in the characters' stream of consciousness". For example, in the chapter [...] "Tohil's Dance", Tohil, the God of Rain in Maya mythology, is imagined by Angel Face as arriving [...] "riding on <b>a</b> <b>river</b> <b>of</b> pigeons' breasts which flowed like milk". In Angel Face's vision, Tohil demands a human sacrifice and is content only so long as he [...] "can prevail over men who are hunters of men". Tohil pronounces: [...] "Henceforth there will be neither true death nor true life. Now dance." [...] As Knightly explains, this scene follows the President's orders for Miguel Angel Face to go on a mission that ends in his death, and is [...] "a sign of the President's evil nature and purposes". Davies contends that these literary techniques, when [...] "combined together with a discontinuous structure, give the text its surrealistic and nightmarish atmosphere".|$|E
