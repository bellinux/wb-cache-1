5|$|The {{historian}} Jens Wehner {{notes that}} the German-language version of the book was immensely popular in Germany, but contained serious flaws in terms of presentation of historical realities. These included the uncritical borrowing from the Nazi propaganda elements of the Fliegerasse ("aces") and stereotypes <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. According to Wehner, the latter could {{be traced to the}} prevailing attitudes during the Cold War. Further, the political and social consequences of World War II were completely ignored.|$|E
5|$|As the Allied armies {{advanced}} into Germany in April 1945, Alsos Mission teams searched Stadtilm, {{where they}} found documentation concerning the German nuclear program, components of a nuclear reactor, and eight tons of uranium oxide. Scientists captured at Göttingen and Katlenburg-Lindau included Werner Osenberg, {{the chief of the}} planning board of the Reichsforschungsrat, and Fritz Houtermans, who provided information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> atomic bomb project. At Celle, the Alsos Mission uncovered an experimental centrifuge for separating uranium isotopes, the result of work undertaken at the University of Hamburg by a team under Paul Harteck.|$|E

5|$|Former {{students}} from Prague, including Constantine Menges, and Czech {{refugees from the}} crisis, {{who were able to}} escape or resettle in Western Countries continued to advocate for human rights, religious liberty, freedom of speech and political asylum for Czech political prisoners and dissidents. Many raised concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and Red Army's continued military occupation of the Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and 1980s, prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of Communism in Moscow and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|While {{this was}} not yet {{the end of the}} media’s freedom after the Prague Spring, it was the {{beginning}} of the end. During November, the Presidium, under Husak, declared that the Czechoslovak press could not make any negative remarks <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> invaders or they would risk violating the agreement they had come to at the end of August. When the weeklies Reporter and Politika responded harshly to this threat, even going so far as to not so subtly criticize the Presidium itself in Politika, the government banned Reporter for a month, suspended Politika indefinitely, and prohibited any political programs from appearing on the radio or television.|$|E
5|$|PBHistory {{documents}} {{were used by}} the officials of various governments. US ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge made use of 21 documents in a speech he made at the United Nations. Information was also funneled to US ambassadors and Congresspeople. The US Congress in 1954 was among the few Republican controlled Congresses in many years. Republicans thus sought to use an anti-communist push to generate support for themselves and to erode the voting base of the Democratic party. Anti-Communist members of the US Congress, such as Charles J. Kersten and Patrick J. Hillings of the Kersten Committee, enthusiastically involved themselves with PBHistory. By August 1954, Kersten was receiving PBHistory documents from Dulles so he could use them in speeches to Congress <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's influence in Guatemala. In September and October 1954, the Kersten Committee held a number of hearings, purportedly investigating the penetration of communist influence. PBHistory {{documents were}} used in this process, and Carlos Castillo Armas became the first head of state to testify before a US Congress committee (although he did so {{through the use of}} a tape recording of his testimony). Although the hearings did little to unearth information about communist presence in Guatemala, they did provide Operation PBHistory with huge publicity within the US.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first and}} most costly example of this {{behavior}} was the mythical [...] "bomber gap."

The result was a massive expansion of the US building program, {{which led to the}} eventual introduction of about 2,500 jet bombers. Although it was not revealed at the time, US intelligence services had actually made real estimates of the size of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> fleet as early as 1956 by placing it at around 20 aircraft.|$|R

25|$|The German forces knew <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> dogs from 1941 onwards, and so took {{measures}} {{to defend against}} them.

Consequently, every German soldier received orders to shoot any dog in combat areas.|$|E

The tendency was to be very pro-American and theatrical in their coverage.|$|E
