40|$|The ponding of {{cold air}} at low {{elevations}} is a major feature of the high-latitude climates of the Arctic, wherever low solar angles combine with incised topography. In Finnish Lapland this cold-air accumulation is critical for flora and fauna (Tenow and Nilssen, 1990; Virtanen et al., 1998) since absolute minimum temperatures control {{the survival of the}} eggs of the autumnal moth Epirrita autumnata. This moth is responsible for outbreaks of defoliation of the mountain birch Betula pubescens. Without cold-air accumulation there would be far more destructive outbreaks in the main inhabited areas. Added to the above concern is that of global warming. Warming is expected to be greater than the global average in the high latitudes (IPCC, 2007) and the temperature rise in winter in Finland over the twenty-first century is expected to be particularly large (Jylhä et al., 2004). Current predictions made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2007) indicate a best estimate annual warming of around + 5 degC for northern Finland by 2099 (~+ 7 degC in winter), as opposed to + 3. 2 degC for Europe as a whole (A 1 B scenario). If the enhancement of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere also alters the propensity for cold-pool formation, local increases in winter temperatures could be even more dramatic than the regional mean, with large consequences for forest damage, local ecology, and the formation/destruction of lake ice in autumn and spring. The cold pool is transient and its formation and destruction are controlled by synoptic conditions (<b>atmospheric</b> <b>gradient</b> winds and cloud cover/radiation balance) as well as the interaction with local topography. The research summarized in this paper comes from a pilot study which aimed to quantify the existence, temporal and spatial extent of the cold pool in Kevo Valley, northern Finland, through operation of an elevationaltransect of automatic temperature loggers.

40|$|Contreversy {{surrounds}} {{the role of}} the ocean in interhemispheric transport of carbon. On one hand, observations in the atmosphere and in the ocean both seem to imply that the preindustrial ocean transported up to 1 Pg Cyr-¹ from the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere. On the other hand, three dimensional (3 -D) ocean models suggest that global interhemispheric transport of carbon is near zero. However, in this debate, there has been a general neglect of the river carbon loop. The river carbon loop includes (1) uptake of atmospheric carbon due to inorganic and organic erosion on land, (2) transport of carbon by river (3) subsequent transport of riverine carbon by the ocean, and (4) loss of riverine carbon back to the atmosphere by air-sea gas exchange. Although carbon fluxes from rivers are small compared to natural fluxes, they have the potential to contribute substantially to the net air-sea fluxes of CO 2. For insignt into this dilemma, we coupled carbon fluxes from a global model of continental erosion to a 3 -D global carbon-cycle model of the ocean. With rivers, total southward interhemispheric transport by the ocean increases from 0. 1 to 0. 35 ± 0. 08 Pg Cyr¯¹, in agreement with oceanographic observations. Resulting air-sea fluxes of riverine carbon and uptake of CO 2 by land erosion were installed as boundary conditions in a 3 -D atmospheric model. The assymetry in these fluxes drives a preindustrial <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gradient</b> of CO 2 at the surface of ­- 0. 6 ± 0. 1 µatm for the North Pole minus the South Pole and longitudinal variations that exceed 0. 5 µatm. Conversely, the gradient for Mauna Loa minus South Pole is only - 0. 2 ± 0. 1 µatm, much less than the - 0. 8 µatm gradient extrapolated linearly from historical atmospheric CO 2 measurements from the same two sites. The difference may be explained by {{the role of the}} terrestrial biosphere. Regardless, the river loop produces large gradients both meridionally and zonally. Acounting for the river carbon loop changes current estimates of the regional distribution of sources and sinks of CO 2, particularly concerning partitioning between natural and anthropogenic processes. ­­...|$|E

We aim at deriving the center-of-mass velocity and the projection factor of the beta-Cephei star alpha-Lup. We present HARPS high spectral resolution observations of alpha-Lup. We calculate the first-moment radial velocities and fit the spectral line profiles by a bi-Gaussian to derive line asymmetries.

We apply to alpha Lup the usual decomposition of the projection factor into three parts, p = p 0 fgrad fog (originally developed for Cepheids), and derive a projection factor of p = 1. 43 +/- 0. 01.

Through a combination of spatio-temporal approaches and statistical methods, I found significant statistical relationships between herring spawning and spring environmental variables.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the nonlinear evolution of Alfvén waves in a radially stratified isothermal atmosphere with wind, from the atmospheric base {{out to the}} Alfvénic point. Nonlinear interactions, triggered by wave reflection due to the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gradients,</b> are assumed to occur mainly in directions perpendicular to the mean radial magnetic field. The nonlinear coupling between waves propagating in opposite directions is modeled by a phenomenological term, containing an integral turbulent length scale, which acts as a dissipative coefficient for waves of a given frequency. Although the wind acceleration profile is not determined self-consistently one may estimate the dissipation rate inside the layer and follow the evolution of an initial frequency spectrum. Reflection of low frequency waves drives dissipation across the whole spectrum, and steeper gradients, i. e. lower coronal temperatures, enhance the dissipation rate. Moreover, when reasonable wave amplitudes are considered, waves of all frequencies damp {{at the same rate}} and the spectrum is not modified substantially during propagation. Therefore the sub-Alfvénic coronal layer acts differently when waves interact nonlinearly, no longer behaving as a frequency dependent filter once reflection-generated nonlinear interactions are included, at least within the classes of models discussed here...|$|R

He developed hydrocephalus postoperatively, and accordingly we placed a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. However, an imbalance between the intra- and extra-cranial atmospheric pressures led to overdrainage, and he suffered cognitive disorders and extremity weakness.

The study of spatial/temporal variability of such effect either allows to improve the positioning precision, and offers important information to forecast significant meteorological events.

At this purpose models of atmospheric profiles of mixing ratio (mr) and of saturated mixing ratio (mrs) were built starting from radiosaunding performed during the Mesoscale Alpine Programme (MAP).

Spectral line variability is investigated via cross-correlation functions (CCFs) computed using three sets of spectral lines (weak, solar, strong). A metallic line velocity gradient, δv_r (t), is computed as the difference between weak and strong-line RVs. CCF shape indicators BIS (asymmetry), FWHM, and depth all exhibit clear phase-dependent variability patterns that differ from one pulsation cycle to the next. Weak-line CCFs exhibit these effects more clearly than strong-line CCFs. BIS exhibits the most peculiar modulated variability {{and can be used}} to identify the presence of cycle-to-cycle modulated line profile variations. δv_r (t) clearly exhibits cycle-to-cycle differences that correlate very closely with modulated BIS variability, suggesting perturbations of the atmospheric velocity field as the cause for modulated spectral line variability. These perturbations are most significant during contraction and are not in phase with the pulsation, transmitting information between consecutive pulsation cycles. This work shows RV curve modulation to be a consequence of <b>atmospheric</b> velocity <b>gradient</b> perturbations. Possible origins of these perturbations and their impact on Cepheid RV measurements as well as the projection factor used in Baade-Wesselink-type distance determinations are discussed.

The SAM-related <b>atmospheric</b> pressure <b>gradient</b> between the Antarctic low and the sub-Antarctic high modulates the strength of the westerlies. The strength variation of the SAM is customarily quantified by the SAM Index, defined as the leading principal component of the 700  hPa atmospheric geopotential height anomalies in the Antarctic region (e.g., Mo 2000).|$|R
