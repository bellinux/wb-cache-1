50|$|Collegiate {{structures}} in the British Isles follow a variety of models. In Oxford and Cambridge, a residential college combines both the residential {{and part of the}} academic aspects of the university in one location. Tutorials are generally given within the college, but lectures are organised by the wider university. In most universities in the UK with residential colleges - Durham (from the 19th century) along with Kent, Lancaster and York (from the 1960s) - formal teaching is carried out only in academic departments. Their colleges are primarily residential and the focus for social and sporting activities, as well <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>student</b> welfare. In these universities, the colleges are (with the exception of two early 20th century colleges at Durham) owned by their parent university. The University of Roehampton has four colleges (all founded in the 19th century) that joined to form the University. The teaching of the University takes place within the colleges, with academic departments being associated with a particular college. Roehampton colleges are, therefore, both residential and academic, but with the academic organisation on very different lines from Oxford and Cambridge. The University of London and the University of the Highlands and Islands are federal universities whose colleges are independent teaching institutes (some, in the case of London, being essentially world-leading universities in their own right) rather than residential colleges. The University of the Arts London is similarly organised, with six constituent teaching colleges, except that these are all owned by the central University rather than being joined in a federal structure. The University of Dublin (founded 1592) in Ireland has only one constituent college, Trinity College, which is thus effectively the whole University rather than a residential college. The University of St Andrews in Scotland contains three colleges, but these have neither a teaching nor residential role.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background At the Medical University of Vienna, most {{information}} for students {{is available only}} online. In 2005, an e-learning project was initiated and there are plans to introduce a learning management system. In this study, we estimate the level of students' computer skills, {{the number of students}} having difficulty with e-learning, and the number of students opposed to e-learning. Methods The study was conducted in an introductory course on computer-based and web-based training (CBT/WBT). Students were asked to fill out a questionnaire online that covered a wide range of relevant attitudes and experiences. Results While the great majority of students possess sufficient computer skills and acknowledge the advantages of interactive and multimedia-enhanced learning material, a small percentage lacks basic computer skills and/or is very skeptical about e-learning. There is also a consistently significant albeit weak gender difference in available computer infrastructure and Internet access. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>student</b> attitudes toward e-learning, we found that age, computer use, and previous exposure to computers are more important than gender. A sizable number of students, 12 % of the total, make little or no use of existing e-learning offerings. Conclusion Many students would benefit from a basic introduction to computers and to the relevant computer-based resources of the university. Given to the wide range of computer skills among students, a single computer course for all students would not be useful nor would it be accepted. Special measures should be taken to prevent students who lack computer skills from being disadvantaged or from developing computer-hostile attitudes. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study {{looks at}} the {{question}} of how and at what level students in primary teacher education can integrate theory and practice, and how the organisation of their learning environment, focusing especially on mathematics and pedagogy, can contribute to that. An instrument has been developed allowing the unambiguous description of the use of theory by students, using the variables nature (four categories: âfactual description,â âinterpreting,â âexplaining,â âresponding toâ) and level (three levels of relations between concepts) of theory use. The instrument can be used both for sounding and assessment purposes. It turns out that nearly all students can integrate theory and practice in a natural way through gaining so-called âtheory-enriched practical knowledge. â This takes place in an adequately equipped multimedia learning environment that is focused on integrating theory and practice. In such a situation, students mainly use theory to âanalyseâ practice or to ârespond toâ practical situations. There are however significant differences, that are among other things expressed in the relation between nature and level of theory use and the variables study year, prior education and numeracy of students. Rises in level of theory use by students turn out to occur mostly during interaction that is led by the teacher educator. Among other things, {{the results of the study}} point towards the need for extra pedagogical measures for those students with âmbo-zonder wiskundeâ (senior secondary vocational education without mathematics) as their prior education, as well <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>student</b> teachers with prior education âvwo with mathematicsâ (pre-university education with mathematics).
