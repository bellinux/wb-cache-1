Her many activities include encouraging young women to pursue careers in science, promoting peace and social justice, and speaking and writing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> effects of science and technology. Many of her articles and speeches on pacifism, feminism, technology and teaching are collected in The Ursula Franklin Reader published in 2006. Franklin {{is also the author of}} The Real World of Technology which is based on her 1989 Massey Lectures broadcast on CBC Radio.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1948 Pei was {{recruited}} by New York real estate magnate William Zeckendorf to join a staff of architects for his firm of Webb and Knapp to design buildings around the country. Pei found Zeckendorf's personality the opposite of his own; his new boss {{was known for his}} loud speech and gruff demeanor. Nevertheless, they became good friends and Pei found the experience personally enriching. Zeckendorf was well connected politically, and Pei enjoyed learning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> world of New York's city planners.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> {{behavior}} of H. suspectum, {{but they have}} been observed engaging in male-male combat, in which the dominant male lies on top of the subordinate one and pins it with its front and hind limbs. Both lizards arch their bodies, pushing against each other and twisting around in an effort to gain the dominant position. A wrestling match ends when the pressure exerted forces them to separate, although bouts may be repeated one after the other. These bouts are typically observed just before the mating season. Those with greater strength and endurance are thought to win more often and enjoy greater reproductive success. Although the Gila monster has a low metabolism and one of the lowest lizard sprint speeds, it {{has one of the highest}} aerobic scope values (the increase in oxygen consumption from rest to maximum metabolic exertion) among lizards, allowing them to engage in intense aerobic activity for a sustained period of time. Males have been observed to have higher aerobic scopes than females, presumably because of sexual selection for a trait advantageous in prolonged combat. The Gila monster may live up to 20 years in the wild, or 30 in captivity.|$|E

25|$|The first {{empirical}} research <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> sharing of emotions {{was conducted in}} 1991.

In all of these studies, 88–96% of emotional experiences were followed by social sharing of those experiences at least one time.|$|E

25|$|There {{is little}} known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> {{organization}} {{and behavior of}} this species, {{in part due to}} its erratic movements and also because individuals are widely characterized as very nervous, always on the move (Shelly et al. 2008), very shy, ‘quick on the wing’ (MacGillivray 1910) and very timid (Burgess 1946; eds Higgins et al. 2001). Birds are often seen singly and in pairs however early Australian records note movements of pied honeyeaters in “constant” flocks, “flying against the wind ……in flocks at times of fifty or more” (Carter 1902, p.84) and in larger flocks of several hundred (Higgins et al. 2001).|$|E
25|$|Since {{the days}} of Grenfell and Hunt, the focus of {{attention}} at Oxyrhynchus has shifted. Modern archaeologists are less interested in finding the lost plays of Aeschylus, although some still dig in hope, and more in learning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>social,</b> economic, and political life of the ancient world. This shift in emphasis had made Oxyrhynchus, if anything, even more important, for the very ordinariness of most of its preserved documents makes them most valuable for modern scholars of social history. Many works on Egyptian and Roman social and economic history and on the history of Christianity rely heavily on documents from Oxyrhynchus.|$|E
25|$|Dolichovespula omissa {{is known}} to be a social {{parasite}} of D. sylvestris in Europe. D. omissa does not have a worker caste and instead the queens of this parasitic species have the workers of the host species raise their young. This is beneficial to D. omissa because {{they do not have to}} use resources to raise their young. In contrast, this is very bad for the tree wasp whose workers are now using their resources to raise offspring that are not related to them at all. Few details are known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> parasite D. omissa or its effect on the nests of D. sylvestris.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, Hayek {{began the}} ‘Abuse of Reason’ project. His {{goal was to}} show how a number of then-popular doctrines and beliefs had a common origin in some {{fundamental}} misconceptions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> science. In his philosophy of science, which has {{much in common with}} that of his good friend Karl Popper, Hayek was highly critical of what he termed scientism: a false understanding of the methods of science that has been mistakenly forced upon the social sciences, but that is contrary to the practices of genuine science. Usually, scientism involves combining the philosophers' ancient demand for demonstrative justification with the associationists' false view that all scientific explanations are simple two-variable linear relationships.|$|E
25|$|Through many initiatives, which {{includes}} the Diversity League Table consultation, Nwokolo has led BSN to work consistently {{in the direction of}} widening meaningful participation and access to legal services in the United Kingdom. She is noted for progressive vision in the following words: “Working with our partners we’re trying to move things forward in terms of creating a legal workforce drawn from the most meritorious. The inclusion of questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> background of lawyers, and lawyers to be, represents an important new phase of the consultation.” This crucial Diversity League Table reporting has four main diversity areas; namely: gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disabilities. Focusing on the demographic composition of law firms and chambers, results are shown as a sequence of organisation profiles and successive leagues tables; ranking participants in major areas, and also showing an overall ranking on the complete Diversity League Table.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1950s, {{a number}} of writers and social {{commentators}} have speculated in some depth <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> and cultural changes that might result from the advent of commercially affordable additive manufacturing technology. Amongst the more notable ideas to have emerged from these inquiries has been the suggestion that, {{as more and more}} 3D printers start to enter people's homes, the conventional relationship between the home and the workplace might get further eroded. Likewise, it has also been suggested that, as it becomes easier for businesses to transmit designs for new objects around the globe, so the need for high-speed freight services might also become less. Finally, given the ease with which certain objects can now be replicated, {{it remains to be seen}} whether changes will be made to current copyright legislation so as to protect intellectual property rights with the new technology widely available.|$|E
