5000|$|The {{placement}} of tubes {{is not a}} cure. If middle ear disease has been severe or prolonged enough to justify tube placement, {{there is a strong}} possibility that the child will continue to have episodes of middle ear inflammation or fluid collection. There may be early drainage through the tube (tube otorrhea) in about 15% of patients in the first two weeks after placement, and developing in 25% more than three months after insertion, although usually not a longterm problem. [...] Otorrhea is considered to be secondary to bacterial colonization. The most commonly isolated organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the most troublesome is Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Some practitioners use topical <b>antibiotic</b> <b>drops</b> in the postoperative period, but research shows that this practice does not eradicate the bacterial biofilm. [...] A laboratory study showed that tubes covered in the antibiotic vancomycin prevented in-vitro formation of MRSA biofilm as compared to noncoated ones, although no study has been conducted on humans yet. Comparing phosphorylcholine-coated fluoroplastic tympanostomy tubes to uncoated fluoroplastic tympanostomy tubes showed no statistically significant difference in the incidence of post-operative otorrhea, tube blockage, or extrusion.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy and the indication of {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF) {{in the treatment}} of exposure of orbital implants. Design: Retrospective and observational case series. Methods: We reviewed 41 patients (41 eyes) suffering exposure of orbital implants from Jan. 2000 to June 2006. The study group patients with mild exposure received combined treatment with bFGF and <b>antibiotic</b> <b>drops,</b> and while the control group patients with mild exposure were treated with <b>antibiotic</b> <b>drops</b> only. The study group patients with moderate and severe exposure received combined treatment with bFGF and <b>antibiotic</b> <b>drops,</b> and after 2 months they were subjected to amniotic membrane transplantation, while the control group patients with moderate and severe exposure underwent amniotic membrane transplantation after using <b>antibiotic</b> <b>drops.</b> Observation of the growth of conjunctival epithelium and comparison of the healing rate of the two groups. Results: The healing rates of the mild, moderate and severe exposure study group were 100 % and 92. 3 %. The healing rates of the mild, moderate and severe exposure control group were 55. 6 % and 66. 7 % respectively. The difference of the healing rates of the mild exposure study group and the control group was significant (P= 0. 033). And the difference of the healing rates of the moderate and severe exposure study group and the control group was not significant (P= 0. 167). Conclusion: bFGF may promote obviously the healing of orbital implant exposure, particularly it can be the first choice for the treatment of mild degree exposure. For the moderate and severe cases, it can be administered before surgical repair to enhance neovascularization and will tend to increase the success rate of surgical repair...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the benefit of}} using therapeutic soft contact lenses in association with NSAID and <b>antibiotic</b> <b>drops</b> {{for the treatment of}} traumatic corneal abrasions. The impact on patient pain and on the incapacity to work are analyzed. Methods: The treatment of 176 consecutive patients presenting with traumatic corneal abrasion was evaluated in a prospective study. Therapeutic contact lenses, NSAID drops (diclofenac), and <b>antibiotic</b> <b>drops</b> (tobramycin) without cycloplegia were used. Results: Psychometric evaluation of pain revealed sufficient comfort with this regimen, allowing 123 patients (80. 39 %) to immediately go back to their occupations. This return to usual occupations varied with the size of the abrasion: it was obtained in 80 patients (93. 02 %) from the "foreign body" group (size of abrasion < 10 mm 2). In the "other etiologie" group, this ability was obtained in 30 of 41 patients (73. 17 %) presenting an abrasion smaller than 10 mm 2, in 6 of 13 patients (46. 15 %) presenting an abrasion between 10 and 20 mm 2, and in 7 of 9 patients (77. 78 %) presenting an abrasion between 20 and 30 mm 2. All the patients with an abrasion longer than 30 mm 2 were unable to continue usual occupations. No serious complications appeared during treatment. Conclusion: Treatment of traumatic corneal abrasion with a contact lens associated with topical NSAID drops sufficiently reduced the pain to allow 80. 39 % of the patients to go return immediately to their normal activities. The combined use of soft contact lenses, NSAID drops, and <b>antibiotic</b> <b>drops</b> without cycloplegia appeared to be an effective treatment for traumatic corneal abrasion.

We have conducted an in vitro experimental study in order to test the toxicity of gentamicin, amikacin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, vancomycin, colistimethate sodium and imipenem-cilastatin eye drops; their cytotoxicity and acute tissue irritation have been evaluated. Cell-based assays were performed on human stromal keratocytes, using a cell-based impedance biosensor system [xCELLigence Real-Time System Cell Analyzer (RTCA) ], and the Hen’s Egg Test for the ocular irritation tests. All the eye drops, except for vancomycin and imipenem, have shown a cytotoxic effect dependent on concentration and time; higher concentrations and longer exposure times will cause a steeper decline in the population of stromal keratocytes. Vancomycin showed a major initial cytotoxic effect, which was reverted over time; and imipenem appeared as a non-toxic compound for stromal cells.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>drops</b> placed in the conjunctival cul-de-sac to antibiotic ointment applied to the lid margin in reduction of bacterial colonization on the lid margin. METHODS: A randomized, prospective, single-masked study was conducted on 19 patients with culture-proven colonization of bacteria on the lid margins. Ophthalmic eligibility criteria included the presence of > or = 50 colony-forming units/mL (CFU/mL) of bacteria on both right and left lids. Each patient received one drop of ofloxacin in one eye every night for one week, followed by one drop {{once a week for}} one month. In the same manner, each patient received bacitracin ointment (erythromycin or gentamicin ointment if lid margin bacteria were resistant to bacitracin) to the lid margin of the fellow eye. Quantitative lid cultures were taken at initial visit, one week, one month, and two months. Fifteen volunteers (30 lids) served as controls. Lid cultures were taken at initial visit, one week, and one month. RESULTS: Both antibiotic drop and ointment reduced average bacterial CFU/mL at one week and one month. Average bacterial CFU/mL reestablished to baseline values at two months. There was no statistically significant difference between antibiotic drop and ointment in reducing bacterial colonization on the lid margin. CONCLUSION: <b>Antibiotic</b> <b>drops</b> placed in the conjunctival cul-de-sac appear to be as effective as ointment applied to the lid margins in reducing bacterial colonization in patients with > or = 50 CFU/mL of bacteria on the lid margins...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Otorrhea is {{the most}} common {{complication}} following tympanostomy tube placement, with an incidence commonly reported at around 20 %. Topical otic <b>antibiotic</b> <b>drops</b> are typically used for relief of otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes. In children with recurrent otorrhea, gastroesophageal reflux and extraesophageal reflux have been postulated {{to be involved in the}} pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion 1. Middle ear inflammation is thought to be mediated by proteolytic activity of pepsin, as well as by the decrease in pH associated with reflux of gastric acid through Eustachian tube.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the normal conjunctival flora and to ascertain their sensitivity to antibiotics. Materials and Methods: Prospective study was undertaken with 56 patients scheduled for cataract surgery. In {{each of these}} patients, conjunctival swab was taken from both eyes before instilling any <b>antibiotic</b> <b>drops</b> or local anesthetics and were sent for culture sensitivity by inoculating the samples in blood agar plates. The un-operated eyes served as controls for the study. The results were tabulated and analyzed by applying confidence intervals at 95 % confidence limits.

40|$|Ocular {{inflammation}} {{secondary to}} bacterial contamination of contact lenses during wear remains a problem. Rare but sight-threatening contact lens related corneal infection can also occur. Previous {{studies have shown}} that overnight lens wear in the same lens results in increased risk of corneal infection and contamination of the lens surface by bacteria has been associated with adverse responses. Increased bacterial load on lenses is a risk factor for development of corneal infection. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the effect on adverse event incidence when a range of lens maintenance interventions were adopted, during extended wear, including daily lens replacement, daily lens cleaning or daily <b>antibiotic</b> <b>drop</b> instillation. The hypothesis tested was that a new or cleaned lens or one exposed to an antibiotic, during extended wear, would result in less bacterially-driven adverse events. A prospective extended wear clinical study (with no intervention) was conducted to determine the risks related to extended wear and adverse event incidence. This study determined the incidence rate of infiltrative and mechanical events and also showed that lens contamination increased the risk of developing inflammatory adverse events This was followed by a series of extended wear studies, each investigating the effect of different lens maintenance interventions on adverse event incidence at the same study site. Nightly lens replacement during extended wear had the least reduction in adverse events. Handling lenses prior to overnight lens wear appeared to overwhelm the benefit offered by a new lens surface. Morning lens replacement during extended wear resulted in reduced incidence of mechanical (1. 2 % vs 5. 2 %, p = 0. 02) and total adverse events (4. 0 % vs 8. 9 %, p = 0. 04). The interventions of morning lens replacement, daily lens cleaning and daily <b>antibiotic</b> <b>drop</b> instillation, during extended wear, did not significantly reduce infiltrative adverse events. However, overall there was a consistent trend toward reduced adverse events with these interventions compared to the control groups suggesting that reduced exposure to potentially contaminated lenses might reduce complications which has implications for development of contact lenses with an antimicrobial surface...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{report on}} the incidence, {{diagnostic}} technique, and microbiological features of endophthalmitis at a university-setting in Brazil. Methods: All cases of presumed postoperative endophthalmitis from 2002 to 2008 at a teaching-hospital were included. Main data assessed were: number of cataract surgeries performed, incidence of endophthalmitis, microbiological outcome (aqueous and/or vitreous culture and Gram staining), and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the positive cases. Results: Seventy-three eyes of 73 patients (43 females and 30 males) developed endophthalmitis after 24, 590 cataract surgeries. The incidence decreased from 0. 49 % in 2003 to 0. 17 % in 2006 and stabilized afterwards. Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS) and Streptococcus viridans (56. 5 % and 15 %, respectively) were the most common bacterial isolates. Culture and Gram stain were negative in 36. 9 %.
