Eliezer is {{transferred}} to the children's block where he stays with 600 others, dreaming of soup. On 5 April 1945 the inmates are told the camp is to be liquidated and {{they are to be}} moved—another death march. On 11 April, with 20,000 inmates still inside, a resistance movement inside the camp attacks the remaining SS officers and takes control. <b>At</b> <b>six</b> <b>o'clock</b> that evening, an American tank arrives at the gates, and behind it the Sixth Armored Division of the United States Third Army.|$|E
5|$|This left Chaltin's {{expedition}} as the spearhead for Leopold's northern campaign, and {{the commandant}} continued his mission despite the grave loss of Dhanis' forces. Chaltin {{had in his}} column eight companies, each containing one-hundred Congolese soldiers led by a Belgian lieutenant. He {{was accompanied by a}} contingent of five hundred Azande under chiefs Renzi and Bafuka. The expedition reached the Nile on 14 February 1897, where a small party of Mahdists from Rejaf exchanged fire with Chaltin's scouts. After two days of waiting for the supply train and rear guard to arrive, a Mahdist force approached the Belgian camp in the evening of 16 February, and prepared to attack. Chaltin ordered his artillery to fire at the Mahdists, causing the assembled rebels to flee under the barrage. The next day, <b>at</b> <b>six</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, Chaltin took to the offensive and began to advance on Rejaf.|$|E
25|$|Life {{aboard the}} ship {{followed}} a routine. <b>At</b> <b>six</b> <b>o'clock,</b> {{the patients were}} awakened and the premises were cleaned up. Breakfast was served at 6:30 AM, then the captain toured the ship for an inspection. Lunch was served at 12:30 PM and tea at 4:30 PM. Patients were treated between meals and those who wished {{to go for a}} walk could do so. At 8:30 PM, the patients went to bed and the captain made another inspection tour.

25|$|On 7 November, {{a survey}} {{was due to}} be {{undertaken}} to establish {{the boundaries of the}} cemetery land. The police had learned that a demonstration was planned for that morning at the cemetery, so <b>at</b> <b>six</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, Police Commissioner Espiau went to the cemetery with 150 officers, and found some 2,000 people already gathered there near the gates. A small number of people were arrested for obstructing the police {{as they made their way}} to the cemetery. Although posters calling people to defend the cemetery had been put up across the city, most of the demonstrators who gathered on 7 November were local people who lived near the cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Fifty-two Cardinals {{entered the}} {{conclave}} on May 12. On {{that same day}} in the evening {{they were joined by}} one more, Granvelle, Viceroy of Naples and official representative of Philip II of Spain. The first step taken by Granvelle was to inform Alessandro Farnese that the King of Spain would not accept his election and to ask him to withdraw his candidature in order to maintain peace in Italy. Surprised, Farnese understood that with such strong opposition he would never obtain the required majority, but, admitting his defeat, he wished {{to be able to use}} his influence effectively in the choice of the new pontiff. Almost the whole next day leaders of the main factions: Farnese, Bonelli, Granvelle and Borromeo, spent looking for a compromise candidate, and finally agreed to elect the 70-year-old Ugo Boncompagni. The first scrutiny took place on May 13 <b>at</b> <b>six</b> <b>o’clock</b> in the evening. At the end of the phase of accessus Ugo Boncompagni was elected Pope, receiving all votes except of his own, which he gave to Granvelle. He accepted his election and took the name of Gregory XIII, in honour of Pope Gregory I.|$|E

500|$|The {{music for}} Countdown to Extinction {{was written in}} two {{different}} sessions. The first session was done following the conclusion of Clash of the Titans tour, while the second session took place after a one-month break, {{in the fall of}} 1991. The album was recorded {{in the first half of}} 1992, when the Rodney King Riots took place. These events negatively affected the recording process, as the band was forced to leave the studio every night <b>at</b> <b>six</b> <b>o'clock</b> because of the enacted curfew. Dave Mustaine shared his experience: [...] "There’s nothing worse than getting a creative moment and you have to leave. It was like a school bell ringing." [...] The record was produced by Mustaine and Max Norman at The Enterprise in Burbank, California, while the mixing was handed by Norman with the help of Fred Kelly. Referring to the recording process, Mustaine said that Countdown to Extinction [...] "was one of those records where everything was firing on all 12 cylinders and you just know it". He also said that it didn't take the band a long time to record the album because [...] "records were a lot easier to make back then because the pressure wasn't quite as hard".|$|E

[...] They were joined by citizens of Torreón and began the sacking of the business district. [...] The mob released prisoners from jail, looted stores, and attacked people on the street. [...] They soon moved to the Chinese district. [...] Men on horses drove Chinese from the gardens back into town, dragging them by their queues and shooting or trampling those who fell. [...] Men, women, and children were killed indiscriminately when they fell {{in the way of}} the mob, and their bodies were robbed and mutilated. [...] It was reported that [...] "n one instance the head of a Chinaman was severed from his body and thrown from the window into the street. [...] In another instance a soldier took a little boy by the heels and battered his brains out against a lamp post. [...] In many instances ropes were tied to the bodies of the Chinamen and they were dragged through the streets by men on horseback. [...] In another instance a Chinaman was pulled to pieces in the street by horses hitched to his arms and legs." [...] The mob finally reached the bank, where they killed the employees and hurled their severed body parts into the streets. [...] A contemporary newspaper reported that [...] "heads of the murdered Chinese were rolled along the streets, and their bodies were tied to the tails of horses." ...|$|E

Two hours later, he exclaimed with relief that the fire had stopped three doors from his home.

Along the way he commandeered a horse, reaching Beechworth at about 1pm. Ellen Barry and Sherritt's widow both later testified at Sherritts' inquest that Byrne had kept behind Mrs. Barry and Weekes so that the police could not take a shot.|$|E

It spoke of such a nameless horror in its owner’s soul that I made the sign for a pipe and proposed, in “pigeon English,” to furnish the necessary coin. The Chinaman sank down on the steps of the hong, like a man hearing medicine proposed to him when he was gangrened from head to foot, and made a gesture, palms downward, toward the ground, as one who said, “It has done its last for me — I am paying the matured bills of penalty.” ...|$|E

Connolly refers to this in his 1983 song [...] "I Wish I Was in Glasgow" [...] with the lines [...] "I would take you there and show you but they've pulled the building down" [...] and [...] "They bulldozed it all to make a road". The flat had only two rooms: a kitchen-living room, with a recess where the children slept and another room for their parents.

The Temptations remained at Hitsville overnight recording [...] "Just My Imagination," [...] and while the other four members went home <b>at</b> <b>six</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, Kendricks remained in the studio, spending several additional hours recording takes for his lead vocal.|$|E

2500|$|Three cities {{make the}} {{claim to be}} Nell Gwyn's birthplace: Hereford, London (specifically Covent Garden), and Oxford. Evidence for {{any one of the}} three is scarce. The fact that [...] "Gwyn" [...] is a name of Welsh origin might support Hereford, as its county is on the border with Wales; The Dictionary of National Biography notes a {{traditional}} belief that she was born there in Pipe Well Lane, renamed to Gwynne Street in the 19th century. London is the simplest choice, perhaps, since Nell's mother was born there and that is where she raised her children. Alexander Smith's 1715 Lives of the Court Beauties says she was born in Coal Yard Alley in Covent Garden and other biographies, including Wilson's, have followed suit. Beauclerk pieces together circumstantial evidence to favor an Oxford birth. The time of Nell's birth is given in a horoscope, with perhaps spurious precision, as Saturday, 2 February 1650, <b>at</b> <b>six</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, though it has also been suggested that a birth around 1642 may be more likely.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the 2002 World Cup, Romário, aged 36, was in {{considerably}} {{good form}} while playing for Vasco da Gama, {{but once again}} he was {{left out of the}} national squad by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari due to indiscipline. The final incident happened when he pulled out of the Brazil squad for the 2001 Copa America in Colombia. He told Scolari that he was having an eye operation, but he played friendlies for club side Vasco da Gama in Mexico and went on holiday instead. The entire country, including President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, called for his inclusion, and Romário gave a televised news conference in which he made his case and apologised, bursting into tears three times, though he said he couldn't remember doing or saying anything against the manager and the players. The BBC's South American football correspondent, Tim Vickery, called Romário's news conference [...] "bizarre" [...] and reported that there were [...] "increasingly credible rumours" [...] that [...] "senior players asked Scolari not to recall the veteran striker". Scolari was unmoved and did not pick him, saying before his squad announcement that Romário's exclusion was [...] "technical and tactical". After the announcement, he said that it was as a result of Romário's withdrawing from the Copa America: [...] "People forget the details, but I do not. I almost got fired from the national team after [...]" [...] (Brazil had been beaten in the quarter-finals by Honduras.) Asked if he would watch Brazil's games on television, Romário, famous for late night partying throughout his career, replied: [...] "The games start <b>at</b> <b>six</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning. At that time, I'm usually getting home." [...] Without Romário, Brazil {{went on to win the}} World Cup for the fifth time in history.|$|E
