40|$|While the law {{governing}} {{the electoral process}} has changed dramatically in the past decade, one thing has stayed the same: Courts and commentators continue to view voting in elections <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> on elections through distinct constitutional lenses. On the spending side, First Amendment principles guide judicial analysis, and recent decisions have been strongly deregulatory. On the voting side, courts rely on a makeshift equal protection-oriented framework, and they {{have tended to be}} more accepting of regulation. Key voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> precedents seldom cite each other. Similarly, election law scholars typically address voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> in isolation. This Article challenges the prevailing, bifurcated approach to voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> law. It maintains that the law’s disparate handling of voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> is unjustified. Voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> are, at bottom, two methods of participating in the electoral process. Conceiving them as two aspects of a broader right to participate—a right the Supreme Court recently articulated, but did not develop, in McCutcheon v. FEC—offers a principled basis to harmonize voting <b>and</b> <b>spending</b> law <b>and</b> reorient election law discourse...|$|R

5|$|Emus are diurnal birds <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> {{their day}} foraging, {{preening}} their plumage with their beak, dust bathing and resting.

5|$|After the Bulls {{won their}} sixth championship, Phil Jackson {{decided to leave}} the team <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> some time away from basketball.

Six players from the 1997–98 Bulls (Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, Luc Longley, Jud Buechler, and Scott Burrell) joined other teams through free agency or sign-and-trade deals, and with few established players left on the roster, the Bulls missed the 1999 playoffs. This began a six-year playoff drought, the longest such drought in team history.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits are semiaquatic.

5|$|Before {{specialized}} {{bulk carriers}} existed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen loaded the cargo into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, {{and put the}} pallets into the cargo hold with a crane. The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> {{time and money to}} build plywood bins into the holds. Then, to guide the cargo through the small hatches, wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the container ship, the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier.|$|E
