50|$|Because of the {{explosion}} hazard related to hydrogen produced by the reaction of aluminium metal with hydrochloric acid, the most common industrial practice is to prepare a solution of <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorohydrate</b> (ACH) by reacting aluminium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid.

50|$|In water purification, this {{compound}} {{is preferred}} {{in some cases}} because of its high charge, which makes it more effective at destabilizing and removing suspended materials than other aluminium salts such as aluminium sulfate, aluminium chloride and various forms of polyaluminium chloride and polyaluminium chlorisulfate, in which the aluminium structure results in a lower net charge than <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorohydrate.</b> Further, {{the high degree of}} neutralization of the HCl results in minimal impact on treated water pH when compared to other aluminium and iron salts.|$|E
50|$|Deodorants {{combined}} with antiperspirant agents {{are classified as}} drugs by the FDA. Antiperspirants attempt to stop or significantly reduce perspiration and thus reduce the moist climate in which bacteria thrive. Aluminium chloride, <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorohydrate,</b> and aluminium-zirconium compounds, most notably aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly and aluminium zirconium trichlorohydrex gly, are frequently used in antiperspirants. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>chlorohydrate</b> and aluminium-zirconium tetrachlorohydrate gly are the most frequent active ingredients in commercial antiperspirants. Aluminium-based complexes react with the electrolytes in the sweat to form a gel plug in the duct of the sweat gland. The plugs prevent the gland from excreting liquid and are removed over time by the natural sloughing of the skin. The metal salts work in another way to prevent sweat from reaching {{the surface of the}} skin: the aluminium salts interact with the keratin fibrils in the sweat ducts and form a physical plug that prevents sweat from reaching the skin’s surface. Aluminium salts also have a slight astringent effect on the pores; causing them to contract, further preventing sweat from reaching the surface of the skin. The blockage {{of a large number of}} sweat glands reduces the amount of sweat produced in the underarms, though this may vary from person to person. Methenamine in the form of cream and spray is successfully used for treatment of excessive sweating and related to it odour. Antiperspirants are usually better applied before bed.|$|E

[...] Aluminium has been established as a neurotoxin and has been shown to adversely affect the blood-brain barrier, cause DNA damage, and have adverse epigenetic effects. [...] Research has shown that the aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects to a number of species such as non-human primates, mice, dogs and others. An experiment with mice found that applying an aqueous solution of aluminum chloride to the skin resulted in [...] "a significant increase in urine, serum, and whole brain aluminium."

40|$|The use of {{integrated}} membrane systems (a train of treatment processes incorporating {{one or more}} membranes) is increasing globally as the technology is very effective {{for the production of}} high quality drinking water. In this investigation a laboratory scale integrated membrane system (IMS) featuring coagulation, powdered activated carbon (PAC) and ultrafiltration (UF) was investigated for the removal of an Australian strain of the cyanobacteria Anabaena circinalis and the cyanotoxin it produced. Three coagulants were compared, <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorohydrate</b> (ACH), aluminium sulphate (alum) and an engineered aluminium coagulant referred to as high performance <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorohydrate</b> (HPAC). PAC (Acticarb PS 1000) was tested to determine adsorption of extracellular saxitoxin. Removal of A. circinalis cells was 100 % by UF alone and the removal of cells prior to the membrane by coagulation reduced fouling attributed to algogenic organic material. Alum was the least efficient coagulant for removal of cells while ACH and HPAC were similar. Saxitoxin removal reached a maximum of 80 % using ACH and PAC.

A positive correlation of floc growth against coagulant dosage was found for ACH based on a limiting growth function. Floc structure was assessed by analysis of PDA derived parameters showing promise for more rapid coagulation condition optimisation than subjective visual criteria. Removal of NOM and growth of flocs are influenced more by the hydrophobicity of the NOM than the choice of coagulant. A higher hydrophobic fraction resulted in slower aggregation of flocs with both coagulants and better removal when using alum at controlled pH. ...|$|E

Abstract: Brackish coal seam water produced from the coal seam gas (CSG) industry is often treated by reverse osmosis to make the water suitable for beneficial reuse.

40|$|Results {{taken from}} {{microfiltration}} and ultrafiltration of the activated sludge effluent {{taken from a}} municipal wasterwater treatment plant in Victoria revealed that microfiltration fouling was governed by pore adsorption of the particles smaller than the pores during the first 20 - 30 minutes of filtration and then follow cake filtration model.

Coagulation with alum and (poly) <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorohydrate</b> (ACH) altered the MF fouling mechanism to follow the cake filtration model from the beginning of filtration. The MF and UF flux improvement by coagulation was due to the removal of some of the foulants in the raw AS effluent by the coagulants. The MF flux improvement was greater for alum than for ACH whereas the two coagulants performed equally well in UF. Coagulation also reduced hydraulically irreversible fouling on the membranes and this effect was more prominent in MF than in UF.

The water concentration follows a sigmoidal behavior with an increase of the water content of about 70 % within 5 μm in a depth of about 14 μm.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a coagulation sequence using <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorohydrate</b> (ACH) and a low MW 34 polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (polyDADMAC), and ferric chloride, for decolourising a high 35 strength industrial molasses wastewater was compared at bench scale. At their optimum dosages, 36 ACH/polyDADMAC gave higher colour removal than FeCl 3 (45 % cf. 28 %), whereas COD reduction 37 was similar (~ 30 %), indicating preferential removal of melanoidins (a major contributor to the 38 colour) by ACH/polyDADMAC. Size exclusion chromatography and fluorescence excitation 39 emission matrix spectrometry suggested that chromophoric Fe-organic complexes were formed 40 during FeCl 3 treatment of the molasses wastewater, which appeared to compromise 41 decolourisation efficiency. Anaerobic bio-treatment of the wastewater enhanced the coagulation 42 efficiency markedly, with FeCl 3 achieving 94 % colour and 96 % COD removal, while 43 ACH/polyDADMAC gave 70 % and 56 % removal, respectively. The improved decolourisation was 44 attributed to the decrease in low MW organics (< 500 Da) and biopolymers by the biological 45 treatment, leading to reduced competition with melanoidins for interaction with coagulant/flocculant. 46 For both the wastewater and biologically treated wastewater, ACH/polyDADMAC treatment gave 47 flocs with markedly better settling properties compared with FeCl 3...|$|E
40|$|Coagulation {{using two}} aluminium- (alum and <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorohydrate</b> (ACH)) and two ferric-based coagulants (ferric {{chloride}} and ferric sulphate) was investigated as a pre-treatment for the UVC/H 2 O 2 {{treatment of a}} high salinity municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC). The ferric-based coagulants were generally better than alum, and ACH was the least efficient in removing dissolved organic carbon (DOC), colour, and A 254 (and thus improving UV transmittance (UVT)). Ferric-based coagulants removed {{a greater proportion of}} most of the DOC fractions. However the reduction of DOC was comparable (46 - 49 %) for alum and ferric chloride at a similar metal dosage (1 mM) for UV fluence of 32 × 103 mJ/cm 2, whereas ferric sulphate performed significantly better (58 %). A similar trend was observed for colour and A 254 reduction, and UVT improvement. The biodegradability almost doubled for UV fluence of 32 × 103 mJ/cm 2 without pre-treatment. The change in biodegradability of the pre-treated samples during UVC/H 2 O 2 treatment was different for each coagulant, due to the difference in the content and type of organic matter removed.

40|$|Montmorillonite {{intercalated}} {{with mixed}} pillars of lantana and alumina was prepared using a refluxed solution of <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorohydrate</b> and lanthanum chloride. It is {{found that there}} are two main groups of pores in the pillared clays so prepared, one of which is around 8 angstrom, being close to that in alumina pillared clay (Al-PILC) and the other is about 14 angstrom. In contrast to the alumina pillared clays, a significantly larger specific surface area and micropore volume remained in LaAl-PILC after heating at high temperatures (700 degrees C and 800 degrees C). It seems that lanthanum ions react with the clay sheets during heating at high temperatures, resulting in a new porous solid phase which is thermally stable but has poor crystallinity. Calcium cations were introduced into the clays during the pillaring process. The calcium, distributed in the micropores of the product, LaAlCa-PILCs, further enhances the resistance to heating at high temperatures. After heating at 800 degrees C, the BET surface area and micropore volume of a LaAlCa-PILC sample remained at about 138 m(2) /g and 0 : 05 cc/g, respectively, with a narrow pore size distribution in the micropore region. The influence of lanthanum and calcium on the pore structure as well as the evolution of pore structure in the PILCs upon heating at high temperatures are discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|Photooxidation by vacuum {{ultraviolet}} radiation (VUV, 254 + 185 nm) was investigated as a pretreatment {{to break down}} the natural organic matter (NOM) in surface water and thus reduce fouling in microfiltration systems for drinking water treatment. The behaviour of variously treated waters, namely raw water, VUV-treated water and water with <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorohydrate</b> as coagulant, were compared in a stirred cell using 0. 22 mu m hydrophobic and surface- modified hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Significant flux improvements were obtained for the VUV-treated waters. VUV-treatment has two interrelated effects; it breaks down the hydrophobic aromatic components of NOM to smaller, more hydrophilic components, and reduces the DOC content by mineralisation. Over the course of a microfiltration run, the DOC content in the permeate initially decreased then gradually increased to approach the feed value. The initial decrease coincided with reduced concentrations of very hydrophobic acid (VHA) and neutral (NEU) fractions in the permeate. The reduction in slightly hydrophobic acid (SHA) concentration was lower, but over a longer period. We propose that the VHA and NEU fractions were strongly adsorbed, and that the SHA fraction was adsorbed until saturation of the adsorption sites in the membrane pores occurred which then enabled the passage of subsequent material. The adsorptive capacity of the hydrophobic membrane was reduced from 10. 3 mg g(- 1) membrane for raw water to 6. 0 mg g(- 1) following VUV-treatment...|$|E
40|$|Mining of brines {{produced}} in the coal seam gas industry for water and salts is of major concern globally. This study focussed {{on the use of}} a dual stage reverse osmosis system to achieve high water recovery rates. It was our hypothesis that an intermediate nanofiltration stage was required to stabilize the performance of the second reverse osmosis stage. The second stage RO membrane was found to be fouled by silica and aluminosilicates when used with any intermediate brine treatment. Theoretical predictions using PHREEQC software supported the experimental outcomes in terms of identifying species with high scaling potential. Coagulation of the coal seam brine using <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorohydrate</b> was found to remove up to 70. 5 % of dissolved silica and thus this method may be useful for prevention of fouling of downstream membranes. ROSA software was also employed to enable selection of possible nanofiltration membranes to treat the coal seam brine sample. Tighter membranes were found to exhibit significantly higher rejection of ions responsible for scale formation during brine concentration operations. Albeit, the flux rates were less than the looser membrane types. A pressure of 20 bar was suggested to be practical for the nanofiltration stage as the flux rate more than doubled from the flux estimated at 15 bar.

40|$|Algal blooms {{lead to the}} {{secretion}} of algal {{organic matter}} (AOM) from different algal species into water treatment systems, and there is very limited information regarding the impact of AOM from different species on the fouling of ceramic microfiltration (MF) membranes. The impact of soluble AOM released from Microcystis aeruginosa and Chlorella sp. separately and together in feedwater on the fouling of a tubular ceramic microfiltration membrane (alumina, 0. 1 mu m) was studied at lab scale. Multi-cycle MF tests operated in constant pressure mode showed that the AOM (3 mg DOC L- 1) extracted from the cultures of the two algae in early log phase of growth (12 days) resulted in less flux decline compared with the AOM from stationary phase (35 days), due to the latter containing significantly greater amounts of high fouling potential components (protein and humic-like substances). The AOM released from Chlorella sp. at stationary phase led to considerably greater flux decline and irreversible fouling resistance compared with that from M. aeruginosa. The mixture of the AOM (1 : 1, 3 mg DOC L- 1) from the two algal species showed more similar flux decline and irreversible fouling resistance to the AOM from M. aeruginosa than Chlorella sp.

Treatment efficiency was assessed in terms of decolourisation and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction of synthetic textile wastewater containing reactive, direct and disperse dyes, along with the other chemical constituents that are normally released from different textile processing units. MgCl 2. 6 H 2 O/Lime produced colour removal efficiency of 99. 68 % at a dosage 1200 mg/L for the wastewater containing all the three dyes together. MgCl 2. 6 H 2 O/Lime was also found to be the most effective coagulant system for treatment of textile wastewater containing only reactive dye, which produced 99. 73 % colour removal at a dosage of 1100 mg/L. For both the direct and disperse dyes, ACH was found to be superior over MgCl 2. 6 H 2 O/Lime, FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O/Lime, and PACl. Industrial grade ACH, which is normally used as polyelectrolyte, for the first time was used as coagulant in this study and was also appeared to be significant for decolourisation of textile wastewater containing all the three dyes together.

The effect of algae {{in the early}}, mid and late phases of growth on membrane fouling, chemical coagulation (alum or <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorohydrate</b> (ACH)) and hydraulic cleaning on the microfiltration of this effluent was investigated. The effect of M. aeruginosa in the early phase was negligible and gave a similar flux profile and permeate volume to that of effluent alone. The increase in M. aeruginosa concentration for the mid and late phases caused {{a significant reduction in}} permeate volume compared with the early phase. Full flux recovery was achieved with an alum dose of 1 mg Al 3 + L - 1 (early phase) and 10 mg Al 3 + L - 1 (mid phase), demonstrating that membrane fouling was hydraulically reversible. For the late phase, the highest flux recovery was 89 %, which was achieved with an alum dose of 5 mg Al 3 + L - 1. Higher alum dosages resulted in a reduction in flux recovery. The use of 1. 5 µm pre-filtration after alum treatment showed little improvement in water quality but led to a drastic reduction in flux recovery, which was attributed to diminishing the protective layer on the membrane surface, thus enabling internal fouling. The performance of ACH was comparable to alum at low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and cell concentration, but was not as effective as alum at high DOC and cell concentration due to the formation of more compact ACH flocs, which resulted in a higher cake layer specific resistance, leading to the deterioration of performance...|$|E
40|$|The natural {{organic matter}} (NOM) removal {{efficiency}} of polysilicato-iron (PSI) coagulants and the fouling potential of PSI pretreated waters {{have been studied}} using two microfiltration (MF) membrane types: polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF- 2) and polypropylene (PP). The results showed that PSI coagulant with a Si/Fe ratio of 1 (PSI- 1) was the most effective, compared to conventional coagulants, in removing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and in improving the fouling potential. A relative flux of unity through PVDF- 2 membrane was achieved for both water sources pretreated with PSI- 1. Aluminium-based coagulants, particularly <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorohydrate</b> (ACH), worked best at lower coagulant dose. Increasing the coagulant dose to improve DOC removal led to increased membrane fouling, possibly due to increased level of unsettleable flocs and pore blocking. For PSI with larger floc size, the advantage of increased DOC removal was not overridden by the adverse effect of pore blocking. In addition, the residual neutral fraction in the waters and/or {{the presence of a}} filter cake on the membrane surfaces seemed to have a limiting effect on the fouling rates through both PP and PVDF- 2 membranes to the extent that similar rates were obtained, despite substantial differences in DOC removal. In contrast, these limiting factors did not influence the fouling potential of PSI- 1 treated waters through the PVDF- 2 membrane, as suggested by the relative flux of unity for both water sources. It is suggested that the oxide deposits on the PVDF- 2 membrane may act as a ‘screening layer’, acting as pre-filtration by the filter cake. This layer may be effectively removed by backwashing, together with deposited NOM, throughout the experiment to maintain the flux at unity. The hydrophobic nature of the PP membrane may discourage the deposition of the oxides, thus minimising the positive effects of the oxides in the system. The high removal of hydrophobic fractions by PSI- 1 may also lead to less association between residual NOM and less binding to the membranes, particularly on the PVDF- 2 membrane...|$|E
40|$|Background Occupational {{irritant}} hand dermatitis (OIHD) is {{an important}} cause of discomfort in the working population. Different preventive measures are in place {{but it is not}} clear how effective these are. Objectives To assess the effect of interventions for preventing OIHD in healthy people who work in occupations where the skin is at risk of damage. Search strategy In May 2010, we searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLlNE and EMBASE. Conference proceedings, and ongoing trials registers were also searched. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying the effectiveness of barrier creams, moisturisers, gloves, complex educational interventions, and other interventions for the prevention of OIHD. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed the trials and extracted data. Main results Four RCTs involving 894 participants from different occupations were included. The primary outcome was numbers of new cases. One large RCT of 708 print and dye workers compared 2 barrier creams (containing silicone or hydrocarbon) versus no intervention. Fewer workers using barrier creams developed OIHD than those who did not (39. 9 % versus 45 %, (OR 0. 75, 95 % CI 0. 53 to 1. 07. P = 0. 11) but this was not statistically significant. In 1 RCT of 54 metal workers less developed OIHD when using an after work emollient or a barrier cream compared to no intervention. There was no statistical difference between the groups at different times of follow-up. One RCT of 111 cleaners and kitchen workers compared a moisturiser (Locobase T) versus no intervention using a cross-over design. While using the moisturiser no participant developed OIHD. During the control period with no skin treatment, 19 (20. 4 %) out of 93 participants developed OIHD. One RCT of 21 hairdressers compared a barrier cream containing <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorohydrate</b> (Excipial protect (TM)) versus its vehicle. No participant developed OIHD while the products were used. Only limited side-effects such as transient itching, stinging, and dryness were reported for the interventions. Authors' conclusions Although the findings of this review were generally positive, no statistical significance was reached. We conclude that at present there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of most of the interventions used in the primary prevention of OIHD. This does not mean that current measures are necessarily ineffective, as the limited studies to date have been rather small and of poor quality. Larger well designed RCTs are now needed in different workplaces to establish the effectiveness of various preventative strategies...|$|E
40|$|Algal {{organic matter}} (AOM) {{released}} from cyanobacteria such as Microcystis aeruginosa {{has a high}} potential to cause severe fouling of low pressure water treatment membranes including ceramic microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes. In this study, {{the influence of the}} characteristics of AOM on the fouling of a 7 -channel tubular ceramic MF membrane (ZrO 2 &ndash;TiO 2, 0. 1 &micro;m) was investigated at lab scale. The AOM (3 mg DOC/L) extracted from M. aeruginosa culture at three different phases of growth (10, 20 and 35 days) all caused severe flux decline, and its fouling potential increased with increasing growth time. The role of AOM components in the fouling of the ceramic membrane was further investigated to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} interaction between the AOM and the membrane. High molecular weight (MW) biopolymers (such as carbohydrates and proteins) were determined as the major foulants determining the severity of the AOM fouling of the ceramic membrane. The majority of the flux decline was attributed to the large amount of organic matter (51 % of total DOC of feed, primarily very high MW hydrophobic molecules) deposited on the ceramic membrane surface to form a thick and dense outer layer. As aquatic humic substances are ubiquitous in surface water, the influence of the interaction between aquatic humic substances and the AOM on the fouling of the MF ceramic membrane was also studied. The irreversible fouling resistance resulting from the mixtures was markedly higher than for all the individual organic fractions. An apparent increase in average molecular size for the AOM-humics mixtures was observed, where some UV-absorbing molecules in the humics appeared to participate in the formation of larger molecules with the AOM. Feedwater pretreatments using chemical coagulation (with aluminium sulphate (alum), <b>aluminium</b> <b>chlorohydrate</b> (ACH), ferric sulphate and ferric chloride) and an advanced oxidation process (AOP) utilising UV/H 2 O 2 were then evaluated as a means to mitigate the membrane fouling. At their optimum dosages (i. e., 5 mg Al 3 +/L and 10 mg Fe 3 +/L), all coagulants could significantly mitigate the membrane fouling, with the hydraulically reversible and irreversible fouling resistance reduced by over 90 % and 65 %, respectively. The reduction in AOM fouling of the membrane was primarily due to the effective removal of the very high MW biopolymers by the coagulants. Both UV/H 2 O 2 and the coagulation with ACH achieved 90 % fouling reductions. However, UV/H 2 O 2 treatment of the AOM produced more low MW compounds, resulting in less flux recovery compared with ACH coagulation due to the enhanced entrapment of these small molecules in the membrane pore structure. Nevertheless, UV/H 2 O 2 treatment could completely remove the cyanobacterial toxin produced by M. aeruginosa, Microcystin-LR (15 &micro;g L- 1), spiked into the feedwater, whereas ACH was ineffective for removing this compound...|$|E
