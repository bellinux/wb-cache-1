5|$|Music intertwines with {{aspects of}} American social and {{cultural}} identity, including through social class, race and ethnicity, geography, religion, language, gender, and sexuality. The relationship between music and race {{is perhaps the most}} potent determiner of musical meaning in the United States. The development of an <b>African</b> <b>American</b> musical identity, out of disparate sources from Africa and Europe, has been a constant theme in the music history of the United States. Little documentation exists of colonial-era <b>African</b> <b>American</b> music, when styles, songs, and instruments from across West Africa commingled in the melting pot of slavery. By the mid-19th century, a distinctly <b>African</b> <b>American</b> folk tradition was well-known and widespread, and <b>African</b> <b>American</b> musical techniques, instruments, and images became a part of mainstream American music through spirituals, minstrel shows, and slave songs. <b>African</b> <b>American</b> musical styles became an integral part of American popular music through blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and then rock and roll, soul, and hip hop; all of these styles were consumed by Americans of all races, but were created in <b>African</b> <b>American</b> styles and idioms before eventually becoming common in performance and consumption across racial lines. In contrast, country music derives from both African and European, as well as Native American and Hawaiian, traditions and yet has long been perceived as a form of white music.|$|E

5|$|Racial {{politics}} {{had long}} {{played a role}} in Baltimore. As the state of Maryland did not attempt to prevent African Americans from voting through Jim Crow laws, political coalitions often involved <b>African</b> <b>American</b> community leaders. Theodore McKeldin, who served as mayor from 1943 through 1947 and from 1963 through 1967, {{was one of the first}} political leaders to work with <b>African</b> <b>American</b> community leaders. By 1999, 63% of Baltimore's registered voters were <b>African</b> <b>American,</b> and 90% were registered to the Democratic Party. Baltimore had not elected a Republican mayor since 1963.|$|E

5|$|Stanton's {{position}} {{caused a}} significant rift {{between herself and}} many civil rights leaders, particularly Frederick Douglass, who believed that white women, already empowered by their connection to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. According to Douglass, their treatment as slaves entitled the now liberated <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men, who lacked women's indirect empowerment, to voting rights before women were granted the franchise. <b>African</b> <b>American</b> women, he believed, {{would have the same}} degree of empowerment as white women once <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men had the vote; hence, general female suffrage was, according to Douglass, of less concern than black male suffrage.|$|E

5|$|After World War 2, William Marbury, then Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Peabody Institute, {{began the}} process of {{integrating}} that institution, which had denied entrance to several well-regarded <b>African</b> <b>American</b> performers based solely on their race, including Anne Brown and Todd Duncan, {{who had been the}} first black performer with the New York City Opera when he was forced to study with Frank Bibb, a member of the Peabody faculty, outside the Conservatory. The director of the Peabody soon ended segregation, both at the Conservatory and at the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, which was conducted by its first <b>African</b> <b>American,</b> A. Jack Thomas, at his request. The Peabody was officially integrated in 1949, with support from mayor Howard W. Jackson. Paul A. Brent, who graduated in 1953, was the first to matriculate, and was followed by Audrey Cyrus McCallum, who was the first to enter the Peabody Preparatory. Musical integration was a gradual process that lasted until at least 1966, when the unions for <b>African</b> <b>American</b> and white musicians merged to form the Musicians' Association of Metropolitan Baltimore. Baltimore is the hometown of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> classical opera tenor Steven Cole.|$|E
50|$|For <b>African</b> <b>Americans,</b> the one-drop {{rule was}} a {{significant}} factor in ethnic solidarity. <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> generally shared a common cause in society regardless of their multiracial admixture, or social/economic stratification. Additionally, <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> found it, near, impossible to learn about their Indigenous American heritage as many family elders withheld pertinent genealogical information. Tracing the genealogy of <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> can be a very difficult process, especially for descendants of Indigenous <b>Americans,</b> because <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> who were slaves were forbidden to learn to read and write, and a majority of Indigenous Americans neither spoke English, nor read or wrote it.|$|R

5|$|After the American Civil War, both Stanton and Anthony {{broke with}} their {{abolitionist}} backgrounds and lobbied strongly against {{ratification of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, which granted <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men the right to vote. Believing that <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men, {{by virtue of the}} Thirteenth Amendment, already had the legal protections, except for suffrage, offered to white male citizens and that so largely expanding the male franchise in the country would only increase the number of voters prepared to deny women the right to vote, both Stanton and Anthony were angry that the abolitionists, their former partners in working for both <b>African</b> <b>American</b> and women's rights, refused to demand that the language of the amendments be changed to include women.|$|E
5|$|Antoinette Wright, {{director}} of the DuSable Museum, has said that <b>African</b> <b>American</b> art has grown out of a need for the culture to preserve its history orally and in art due to historical obstacles {{to other forms of}} documentation. She also believes that the museum serves as a motivational tool for members of a culture that has experienced extensive negativity. In the 1980s, <b>African</b> <b>American</b> museums such as the DuSable endured the controversy of whether negative aspects of the cultural history should be memorialized. In the 1990s, the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> genre of museum began to flourish despite financial difficulties. In 2016, the museum formed an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|Because Baltimore's {{electorate}} {{is overwhelmingly}} Democratic, whoever won the Democratic primary election {{was seen as}} the favorite over the Republican nominee in the general election. Baltimore's large <b>African</b> <b>American</b> population initially made it seem likely that the next mayor would also be <b>African</b> <b>American.</b> Kweisi Mfume was the preferred candidate of local politicians, but he opted not to run. Though Carl Stokes and Lawrence Bell, members of the City Council, declared for the race, local leaders were underwhelmed with the quality of declared candidates.|$|E

40|$|<b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> are two to {{four times}} more likely to develop {{dementia}} as Non-Hispanic Whites. This increased risk among <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> represents a critical health disparity that affects nearly 43 million Americans. The present study tested the hypothesis that older <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> with elevated beta-amyloid would show greater neurodegeneration (smaller hippocampal volumes and decreased cortical thickness) than older Non-Hispanic Whites with elevated beta-amyloid. Data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) were used to form a group of older <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and two matched groups of Non-Hispanic White adults. Amyloid-positive <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> had decreased cortical thickness in most of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) signature regions compared with amyloid-positive Non-Hispanic Whites. This factor was negatively correlated with age and white matter hypointensities. Using support vector regression, we also found some evidence that <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> have an older “brain age” than Non-Hispanic Whites. These findings suggest that <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> might be more susceptible to factors causing neurodegeneration, which then might accelerate the rate of a diagnosis of AD...|$|R
5|$|Charles DeWitt Watts (September 21, 1917 – July 12, 2004) was an <b>African</b> <b>American</b> {{surgeon and}} activist for the poor.

Earning his medical degree in 1943 from Howard University College, {{he was the first}} <b>African</b> <b>American</b> board {{certified}} surgeon to serve in North Carolina. After surgical training at Freedman's Hospital in Washington, D.C. in 1949, he moved to Durham, North Carolina in 1950 and established a clinic to provide access to medical services for the poor. Breaking the social customs of racial obstacles, he advocated for certification of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> medical students. He also became a member of many professional colleges including the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine and the American College of Surgeons. He served as chief of surgery at Durham's Lincoln Hospital and was later one of the key figures in converting it to the Lincoln Community Health Center, a low-priced clinic for the poor.|$|E

The only male <b>African</b> <b>American</b> in the company during her career, Danny Tidwell, left in 2005. In an international ballet community with a lack of diversity, she was so unusual as an <b>African</b> <b>American</b> ballerina, that she endured cultural isolation.
