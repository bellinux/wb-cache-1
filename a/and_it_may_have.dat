5|$|Another {{earthquake}} {{struck in}} 1202, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been after this {{event that the}} castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no trace {{of it has been}} discovered.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} ceratopsians, but closer to Triceratops than Yinlong. Once in its own family, Psittacosauridae, with other genera like Hongshanosaurus, it is now considered to be senior synonym of the latter and an early offshoot of the branch that led to more derived forms. The genera closely related to Psittacosaurus are all from Asia, with the exception of Aquilops, from North America. The first species was either P. lujiatunensis or closely related, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> given rise to later forms of Psittacosaurus.|$|E
5|$|As it {{was easy}} to find and kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch {{settlers}} and later by Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> competed with domestic livestock for forage. The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild individual died in 1878.|$|E

5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behavior. The Lānai hookbill is only known to have eaten {{the fruit of the}} ōpuhe; however, it is unlikely that its unique bill would have developed to eat fruit, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a snail specialist. The hookbill has not been seen since 1918, and by 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into pineapple fields, destroying the bird’s habitat. The combination of habitat destruction and the introduction of feral cats and rats are thought to have led to the Lānai hookbill’s extinction.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} Saxon and early medieval period {{there were at}} least four {{buildings}} on the summit. The base of a stone cross demonstrates Christian use of the site during this period <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been a hermitage. The broken head of a wheel cross dated to the 10th or 11th centuries was found part way down the hill and may have been the head of the cross that stood on the summit. The head of the cross is now in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton.|$|E
5|$|Enaliarctos, {{a fossil}} species of late Oligocene/early Miocene (24–22 mya) California, closely resembled modern pinnipeds; it was adapted to an aquatic {{life with a}} {{flexible}} spine, and limbs modified into flippers. Its teeth were adapted for shearing (like terrestrial carnivorans), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> stayed near shore more often than its extant relatives. Enaliarctos was capable of swimming with both the fore-flippers and hind-flippers, but {{it may have been}} more specialized as a fore-flipper swimmer. One species, Enaliarctos emlongi, exhibited notable sexual dimorphism, suggesting that this physical characteristic may have been an important driver of pinniped evolution. A closer relative of extant pinnipeds was Pteronarctos, which lived in Oregon 19–15 mya. As in modern seals, Pteroarctos had an orbital wall that was not limited by certain facial bones (like the jugal or lacrimal bone), but was mostly shaped by the maxilla.|$|E

5|$|Hunting {{close to}} the sea floor, the bignose shark feeds on bony and {{cartilaginous}} fishes, and cephalopods. It is viviparous, meaning the embryos are sustained to term via a placental connection. Females bear litters of three to 15 pups after a 10-month gestation period. Despite its size, this shark lives too deep to pose much danger to humans. It is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries {{in many parts of}} its range; the meat, fins, skin, liver oil, and offal may be used. The International Union for Conservation of Nature presently lacks enough information to assess the global conservation status of this species. However, the various fishing pressures within its range are cause for concern given its slow reproductive rate, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> already declined in the northwestern Atlantic and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|It {{was moved}} to its current {{location}} on St George's Street {{at the edge of}} the village, although the date when this was done is unclear. The site where the cross now stands was levelled in 1776 by workmen, paid by Henry Fownes Luttrell, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been on this occasion that the cross was moved. An alternative local tradition is that it was moved in 1825, although a drawing by J. M. W. Turner made in 1811 suggests it was in its present position by then.|$|E
5|$|Its {{large size}} {{may have been}} due to climactic factors and the {{abundance}} of large prey items, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also been influenced by the evolution of regional endothermy (mesothermy) which would have increased its metabolism. However, since the Otodontidae sharks are considered to have been ectotherms, and megalodon was a close relative to them, megalodon may have also been ectothermic. Contrary to this, the largest contemporary ectothermic sharks, such as the whale shark, are filter feeders, implying some metabolic constraints with a predatory lifestyle. That is to say, it is unlikely that megalodon was ectothermic.|$|E

5|$|The Su-25UBM is a twin seat variant {{that can}} be used as an {{operational}} trainer, but also has attack capabilities, and can be used for reconnaissance, target designation and airborne control. Its first flight was on 6 December 2008 and it was certified in December 2010. It will enter operational use with the Russian Air Force later. The variant has a Phazotron NIIR Kopyo radar and Bars-2 equipment on board. Su-25UBM's range is believed to be 1,300km <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> protection against infra-red guided missiles (IRGM), a minimal requirement on today's battle fields where IRGMs proliferate.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Tibbers Castle is undocumented, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been {{founded in the}} 12th or 13th century as a timber castle. It was first {{recorded}} in 1298 when Sir Richard Siward, either built the stone enclosure castle or enhanced one which had already {{been added to the}} timber structure. King Edward I of England visited the castle the same year. Siward was the Sheriff of Dumfries when the area was {{under the control of the}} English and documentation from this period gives some evidence for activity at the castle. In 1302, £100 was spent on the structured while it was manned by a 23-strong garrison.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} of the Rodrigues parrot had similarities with the Tanygnathus and Psittacula parrot genera. The pectoral and pelvic bones {{were similar in}} size {{to those of the}} New Zealand kaka (Nestor meridionalis), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> looked similar to the great-billed parrot (Tanygnathus megalorynchos) in life, but with a larger head and tail. It differed from other Mascarene parrots in several skeletal features, including having nostrils that faced upwards instead of forwards. No features of the skull suggest it had a crest like the broad-billed parrot, and there is not enough fossil evidence to determine whether it had pronounced sexual dimorphism. There are intermediate specimens between the longest and shortest examples of the known skeletal elements, which indicates there were no distinct size groups.|$|E

5|$|Conflicting {{reports have}} been made as to its {{preferred}} habitat; two papers suggest it preferred channels to floodplains, but another suggests it preferred the opposite. The possible preference for channels {{is based on the}} relative abundance of thescelosaur fossils in sandstones, representing channel environments, in comparison to mudstones, representing floodplain environments. No bonebeds or accumulations of multiple individuals have yet been reported. Dale Russell, in a popular work, noted that Thescelosaurus was the most common small herbivore in the Hell Creek Formation of the Fort Peck area. He described the environment of the time as a flat floodplain, with a relatively dry subtropical climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from angiosperm trees, to bald cypress, to ferns and ginkgos. Although most dinosaur skeletons from this area are incomplete, possibly due to the low preservation potential of forests, Thescelosaurus skeletons are much more complete, suggesting that this genus frequented stream channels. Thus when a Thescelosaurus died, it may have been in or near a river, making it easier to bury and preserve for later fossilization. Russell tentatively compared it to the capybaras and tapirs. Other dinosaurs that shared its time and place include the ceratopsids Triceratops and Torosaurus, hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus, ankylosaurid Ankylosaurus, pachycephalosaurian Pachycephalosaurus, and the theropods Ornithomimus, Troodon, and Tyrannosaurus. Thescelosaurus was also abundant in the Lance Formation. Toe bones from this genus are the most common finds after fossils of Triceratops and Edmontosaurus, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been the most common dinosaur there in life, if the Lance Formation had a preservational bias against small animals.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Bertha was {{an unusual}} {{tropical}} cyclone in early August 2014 that attained minimal hurricane status, despite having a disheveled appearance and a relatively high atmospheric pressure. On July26, a tropical wave south of the Cape Verde Islands was monitored for possible tropical cyclogenesis. Over the following days, it slowly developed and acquired gale-force winds and enough convection to be designated as Tropical Storm Bertha early on August1. A mostly disorganized cyclone, Bertha quickly moved across the Lesser Antilles, clipping {{the northern end of}} Martinique, later that day. During its trek across the eastern Caribbean Sea, its circulation became severely disrupted <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> degenerated into a tropical wave. On August3, it traversed the Mona Passage and moved over the Southeastern Bahamas where conditions favored development. Despite an overall ragged appearance on satellite imagery, data from Hurricane Hunters indicated it intensified to a hurricane on August4; it acquired peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) that day. Turning north, and later northeast, Bertha soon weakened as it began to merge with an approaching trough to the west. This merger ultimately took place on August6, at which time Bertha was declared extratropical well to the south of Nova Scotia. The remnant system raced eastward across the Atlantic and later struck the United Kingdom on August10. Once over the North Sea, the storm stalled for a few days before resuming its eastward track. It was last noted around the Baltic Sea on August16.|$|E
5|$|St. Regulus Chapel at St. Andrews {{dates from}} around 1150 and was {{probably}} {{built as a}} reliquary church. Only the aisless choir and tall square tower survive. Its detailing derives from work on a church at Wharram-le-Street in England <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been {{carried out by the}} same Yorkshire masons. The first monastic establishment built in the Romanesque style was Dunfermline Abbey, begun at the behest of Queen Margaret about 1074. An existing small chapel was expanded with a square choir and rounded apse. About fifty years later it was replaced by a grander cruciform church of which only the nave now survives. The chevron pattern in the detailing on the piers was modelled on that at Durham Cathedral. Similarly, St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney, begun in 1137, may have employed masons who had worked at Durham, with which it shares a similar pattern of great round arches based on thick cylindrical pillars. The arrival of the new monastic orders in Scotland from the twelfth century led to a boom in ecclesiastical building using English and continental forms, including abbeys at Kelso, Holyrood, St Andrews and Jedburgh, one of the most complete Romanesque buildings to survive.|$|E
