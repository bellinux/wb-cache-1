5|$|There are two {{distinct}} wine-producing regions in Croatia. The continental {{region in the}} northeast of the country, especially Slavonia, is capable of producing premium wines, particularly whites. Along the north coast, Istrian and Krk wines {{are similar to those}} produced in neighbouring Italy, while further south in Dalmatia, Mediterranean-style red wines are the norm. Annual production of wine exceeds 140million litres. Croatia was almost exclusively a wine-consuming country up until the late 18th century when a more massive production and consumption of beer started; the <b>annual</b> <b>consumption</b> of beer in 2008 was 83.3litres per capita which placed Croatia in 15th place among the world's countries.|$|E
5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are {{required by law to}} be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated <b>annual</b> <b>consumption</b> of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter in a saucepan, flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.|$|E

However, {{there are a number of}} economic barriers which would have to be addressed in order to make district heating competitive in comparison with alternative heating technologies. The objective of this research was to model and analyse a district heating network and develop an optimisation method to calculate the minimum capital investment, heat losses and pump energy consumption. Firstly, modelling and analysis of a district heating network was conducted to obtain district heating design cases with minimum <b>annual</b> total energy <b>consumption,</b> <b>annual</b> total exergy <b>consumption</b> and annualised cost. Then through the analysis, a two-stage programming model was developed which synthesised design and optimal operation of a district heating network. The optimisation was used to minimise <b>annual</b> total energy <b>consumption,</b> <b>annual</b> total exergy <b>consumption</b> or annualised cost of the heat network by selecting suitable pump and pipe sizes, taking into account different parameters such as target pressure loss, temperature regime and operating strategy. The optimisation technique was used to investigate two different case studies, with high and low heat density. In all cases, a variable flow and variable supply temperature operating method was found to be beneficial. Design cases with minimum <b>annual</b> total energy <b>consumption</b> and annualised cost used rather small pipe diameters and large pressure drops. To achieve the minimum <b>annual</b> total exergy <b>consumption</b> a design case with larger pipe diameters and smaller pressure loss was found to be desirable. It was observed that by reducing the water temperature and increasing temperature difference between supply and return pipes, the <b>annual</b> total energy <b>consumption,</b> <b>annual</b> total exergy <b>consumption</b> and the annualised cost were reduced. It was also shown that district heating in an area with high heat density is more energy efficient and cost effective...|$|R

25|$|Absinthe's {{popularity}} grew steadily {{through the}} 1840s, when absinthe {{was given to}} French troops as a malaria preventive. When the troops returned home, they brought their taste for absinthe home with them. The custom of drinking absinthe gradually became so popular in bars, bistros, cafés, and cabarets that, by the 1860s, the hour of 5p.m. was called l'heure verte ("the green hour"). Absinthe was favoured by all social classes, from the wealthy bourgeoisie, to poor artists and ordinary working-class people. By the 1880s, mass production had caused the price of absinthe to drop sharply. By 1910, the French were drinking 36million litres of absinthe per year, as compared to their <b>annual</b> <b>consumption</b> of almost 5billion litres of wine.|$|E

500|$|In the Early Middle Ages beer was {{primarily}} brewed in monasteries, {{and on a}} smaller scale in individual households. By the High Middle Ages breweries in the fledgling medieval towns of northern Germany began to take over production. Though most of the breweries were small family businesses that employed at most eight to ten people, regular production allowed for investment in better equipment and increased experimentation with new recipes and brewing techniques. These operations later spread to the Netherlands in the 14th century, then to Flanders and Brabant, and reached England by the 15th century. Hopped beer became very popular in the last decades of the Late Middle Ages. In England and the Low Countries, the per capita <b>annual</b> <b>consumption</b> was around , and it was consumed with practically every meal: low alcohol-content beers for breakfast, and stronger ones later in the day. When perfected as an ingredient, hops could make beer keep for six months or more, and facilitated extensive exports. In Late Medieval England, the word beer came to mean a hopped beverage, whereas ale had to be unhopped. In turn, ale or beer was classified into [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "small", the latter less intoxicating, regarded as a drink of temperate people, and suitable for consumption by children. As late as 1693, John Locke stated that the only drink he considered suitable for children of all ages was small beer, while criticizing the apparently common practice among Englishmen of the time to give their children wine and strong alcohol.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the operating efficiency of air-cooled chillers in three existing hotels and investigates {{the extent to}} which the <b>annual</b> electricity <b>consumption</b> can decrease by improving their efficiency.

When chiller sequencing is restored, their seasonal efficiency could be enhanced to 0. 34 kW/kW, which corresponds to an 8. 8 - 22. 7 % drop in their <b>annual</b> electricity <b>consumption.</b> It is possible to further decrease the <b>annual</b> electricity <b>consumption</b> by 27. 0 - 38. 6 % when the chillers operate under floating condensing temperature control instead of head pressure control.
