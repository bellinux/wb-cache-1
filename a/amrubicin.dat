50|$|The {{first is}} {{sometimes}} referred to as random collection and screening of material, but in fact the collection is often far from random in that biological (often botanical) knowledge is used about which families show promise, based on a number of factors, including past screening. This approach is {{based on the fact that}} only a small part of earth’s biodiversity has ever been tested for pharmaceutical activity. It is also based on the fact that organisms living in a species-rich environment need to evolve defensive and competitive mechanisms to survive, mechanisms which might usefully be exploited in the development of drugs that can cure diseases affecting humans. A collection of plant, animal and microbial samples from rich ecosystems can potentially give rise to novel biological activities worth exploiting in the drug development process. One example of a successful use of this strategy is the screening for antitumour agents by the National Cancer Institute, started in the 1960s. Paclitaxel was identified from Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia. Paclitaxel showed anti-tumour activity by a previously undescribed mechanism (stabilization of microtubules) and is now approved for clinical use for the treatment of lung, breast and ovarian cancer, as well as for Kaposi's sarcoma. Early in the 21st century, Cabazitaxel (made by Sanofi, a French firm), another relative of taxol has been shown effective against prostate cancer, also because it works by preventing the formation of microtubules, which pull the chromosomes apart in dividing cells (such as cancer cells). Other examples are: 1. Camptotheca (Camptothecin · Topotecan · Irinotecan · Rubitecan · Belotecan); 2. Podophyllum (Etoposide · Teniposide); 3a. Anthracyclines (Aclarubicin · Daunorubicin · Doxorubicin · Epirubicin · Idarubicin · <b>Amrubicin</b> · Pirarubicin · Valrubicin · Zorubicin); 3b. Anthracenediones (Mitoxantrone · Pixantrone).|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>amrubicin</b> {{in patients}} with impaired hepatic function have not been reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the pharmacokinetics of <b>amrubicin</b> and its major metabolite, amrubicinol, and to assess the safety of <b>amrubicin</b> in lung cancer patients with impaired hepatic function and those with normal hepatic function. Materials and methodsFive patients with impaired hepatic function (arm I) and 10 patients with normal hepatic function (arm N) with small or non-small cell lung carcinoma were enrolled. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine the <b>amrubicin</b> and amrubicinol concentrations. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by non-compartmental analysis. ResultsThe terminal half-lives of <b>amrubicin</b> and amrubicinol in whole blood and plasma were slightly longer in arm I than in arm N. The area under the concentration–time curve (AUC 0 – 24 h) values of <b>amrubicin</b> in plasma and AUC 0 – 120 h of amrubicinol in whole blood in arm I were not larger than those in arm N because of dose adjustments based on prior treatment history and baseline values of total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. The dose-normalized AUCs (dose 40 mg/m 2) of <b>amrubicin</b> and amrubicinol in arm I were slightly larger than those in arm N.

40|$|BackgroundAmrubicin, a new {{anthracycline}} agent, {{has shown}} high activity for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) with acceptable toxicities in previous studies. However, a combination regimen of platinum and <b>amrubicin</b> for elderly patients {{has not been}} reported. In this phase I study, the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the maximal tolerable dose (MTD), and the antitumor activity {{of a combination of}} <b>amrubicin</b> and carboplatin in elderly patients with SCLC were evaluated. Patients and MethodsPreviously untreated elderly patients (≥ 70 years old) with SCLC were enrolled in this study. <b>Amrubicin</b> was administered from day 1 to day 3, and carboplatin was administered on day 1 intravenously. The treatment was repeated every 3 weeks. Three escalating dose levels of <b>amrubicin</b> (mg/m 2) /carboplatin (area under the curve; AUC) (40 / 4. 0, 40 / 5. 0, and 45 / 5. 0) were initially planned. ResultsTwelve patients were enrolled. At level 1 (<b>amrubicin</b> 40 mg/m 2 and carboplatin AUC 4. 0), all three patients experienced DLTs (grade 4 neutropenia ≥ 4 days, thrombocytopenia < 20, 000 /mm 3, or grade 3 diarrhea), and this dose level was determined to be the MTD. At the reduced dose of level 0 (<b>amrubicin</b> 35 mg/m 2 and carboplatin AUC 4. 0), although DLTs were observed in three of the nine patients, they were considered to be clinically not severe and could be managed. Non-hematological toxicities were mild or moderate and reversible. The objective response rate was 83 %, and the median survival time was 12. 7 months.

Clinical trials ongoing in the Untied States and Europe {{will determine whether}} <b>amrubicin</b> will be effective in other ethnic groups (whites) or whether {{this will be an}} example of geographic and/or genetic variation. Genetic polymorphisms in the UGT 1 A 1 gene have been identified as one of the causes of the increased diarrhea seen in white patients treated with irinotecan when compared with Japanese patients. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form–quinone oxidoreductase (NQ 01) is an enzyme that participates in the metabolism of <b>amrubicin</b> and polymorphisms of the enzyme, known to occur in the Asian population, might explain the effectiveness of the drug in Japanese patients with small cell lung cancer. Studies to evaluate the drug in US and European patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer are ongoing. Levels of NQ 01 will also be determined in these studies...|$|E

40|$|IntroductionAmrubicin is a {{promising}} {{agent in the}} treatment of lung cancer, but predictive biomarkers have not yet been described. NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO 1) is an enzyme known to metabolize amrubicinol, the active metabolite of <b>amrubicin,</b> to an inactive compound. We examined the relationship between NQO 1 and amrubicinol cytotoxicity. MethodsGene and protein expression of NQO 1, amrubicinol cytotoxicity, and C 609 T single-nucleotide polymorphism of NQO 1 were evaluated in 29 lung cancer cell lines: 14 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 15 non-SCLC (NSCLC). The involvement of NQO 1 in amrubicinol cytotoxicity was evaluated by small interfering RNA against NQO 1. ResultsA significant inverse relationship between both gene and protein expression of NQO 1 and amrubicinol cytotoxicity was found in all cell lines. Treatment with NQO 1 small interfering RNA increased amrubicinol cytotoxicity and decreased NQO 1 expression in both NSCLC and SCLC cells. Furthermore, cell lines genotyped homozygous for the 609 T allele showed significantly lower NQO 1 protein expression and higher sensitivity for amrubicinol than those with the other genotypes in both NSCLC and SCLC cells. ConclusionsNQO 1 expression {{is one of the major}} determinants for amrubicinol cytotoxicity, and C 609 T single-nucleotide polymorphism of NQO 1 could be a predictive biomarker for response to <b>amrubicin</b> treatment...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundAmrubicin is a {{synthetic}} anthracycline drug {{that is a}} potent inhibitor of topoisomerase II. We have performed a multicenter phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of <b>amrubicin</b> for patients with previously treated {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). MethodsPatients with advanced NSCLC who experienced disease recurrence after one platinum-based chemotherapy regimen were eligible for enrollment in the study. <b>Amrubicin</b> was administered by intravenous injection at a dose of 40 mg/m 2 on 3 consecutive days every 3 weeks. ResultsSixty-one enrolled patients received a total of 192 treatment cycles (median, 2; range, 1 – 15). Response was as follows: complete response, 0; partial response, seven (11. 5 %); stable disease, 20 (32. 8 %); and progressive disease, 34 (55. 7 %). Median progression-free survival was 1. 8 months, whereas median overall survival was 8. 5 months, and the 1 -year survival rate was 32 %. Hematologic toxicities of grade 3 or 4 included neutropenia (82. 0 %), leukopenia (73. 8 %), thrombocytopenia (24. 6 %), and anemia (27. 9 %). Febrile neutropenia occurred in 18 patients (29. 5 %). One treatment-related death due to infection was observed. Nonhematologic toxicities were mild. ConclusionsAmrubicin is a possible alternative for second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC, although a relevant hematological toxicity is significant, especially with a febrile neutropenia...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} <b>amrubicin</b> plus cisplatin (AP) following chemoradiotherapy for limited-disease small-cell lung cancer, chemo-naïve patients aged 20 – 70 years with a performance status of 0 or 1 and normal organ functions were treated with etoposide 100 mg/m 2 on days 1 – 3, cisplatin 80 mg/m 2 on day 1 and concurrent thoracic radiotherapy at 45 Gy/ 30 fractions (EP-TRT), followed by three cycles of <b>amrubicin</b> 40 mg/m 2 on days 1 – 3 and cisplatin 60 mg/m 2 on day 1 every 3 weeks. The EP-TRT could be completed in 21 patients (15 male and 6 female patients with a median age of 62 years). Of these, 2, 1 and 18 (86 %) patients received one, two and three cycles of AP, respectively. Sixteen (76 %) patients required granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) support. Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia occurred in all patients. Grade 3 febrile neutropenia was observed in 9 patients, lasting for 1 day in 5 patients. The incidences of grade 3 / 4 thrombocytopenia and anemia were 43 and 24 %, respectively. Grade 3 infection and anorexia occurred in 2 and 3 patients, respectively. The response rate was 95 %. The median (95 % confidence interval [CI]) progression-free survival (PFS) was 41. 9 (0 – 102) months, and the 5 -year PFS rate (CI) was 41. 9 % (20. 4 – 63. 4 %). The median overall survival (OS) has not been reached yet, and the 5 -year OS rate (CI) was 57. 8 % (35. 2 – 80. 4 %).

The patient underwent several chemoradiation therapy regimens, including cisplatin + irinotecan + radiation, S- 1 + paclitaxel, <b>amrubicin,</b> carboplatin + etoposide, nogitecan, and docetaxel for lung metastases and radiation for brain and bone metastases for 43  months. He finally died of brain metastases 74  months after surgery (47  months after recognition of the lung metastases). Long continuous multimodal treatment including surgery, regimens for small cell lung cancer, S- 1, taxanes, and radiation was thought to prolong the survival of this man with small cell carcinoma of the stomach.|$|E
40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer death, and {{approximately}} 15 % of all lung cancer patients have small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Although second-line chemotherapy can produce tumor regression, the prognosis is poor. <b>Amrubicin</b> hydrochloride (AMR) is a synthetic anthracycline anticancer agent and a potent topoisomerase II inhibitor. Here, we discuss the features of SCLC, the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of AMR, the results of in vitro and in vivo studies, and the efficacy and safety of AMR monotherapy and combination therapy in clinical trials. With its predictable and manageable toxicities, AMR is one of the most attractive agents for the treatment of chemotherapy-sensitive and -refractory relapsed SCLC. Numerous studies are ongoing to define the applicability of AMR therapy for patients with SCLC. These clinical trials, including phase III studies, will clarify the status of AMR in the treatment of SCLC...|$|E
