5|$|Bob Napolitano, Wilson's {{coach at}} Londonderry High School, noticed Wilson's ability to {{concentrate}} on baseball. Napolitano specifically remembered the first home game of Wilson's senior year, which happened shortly after his father's death. No fewer than 29 professional scouts, all with radar guns, showed up to see him pitch. According to Napolitano, Wilson was completely oblivious to their appearance; he <b>ate</b> <b>and</b> drank in the dugout, warmed up, and pitched a two-hitter while apparently not noticing that scouts were there. The Cleveland Indians offered him a contract straight out of high school, {{but he did not}} sign, opting to attend college instead.|$|E
5|$|Lt. Blue and Parrish {{returned}} to Sugar Hollow where Parsons was awaiting them, and Parsons set about locating pine {{from which to}} make torches to light {{their way out of}} the hollow. Parsons carried with him a small hatchet, and began splitting pine in the darkness to fashion a torch. He accidentally struck himself in the knee with his hatchet, and Blue applied a handkerchief to his wound to stop its bleeding. The three men traveled through the dark and rain to the nearby home of Frank Carter, where they <b>ate</b> <b>and</b> dried their clothes by the fire. The following morning, they mounted their horses and traveled to Rev. Harris' home, where Parsons and Blue parted with Parrish. Parsons and Blue continued east over Town Hill and reached George Thompson's residence on the Little Cacapon River, which had risen due to the previous night's rainfall. They remained with Thompson for two days until the river subsided, then traveled to Blue's Gap, where they set up camp. There, Lt. Blue received orders from Col. Angus William McDonald to carry out an expedition for General Stonewall Jackson to ascertain the number of Union Army infantry, cavalry, and artillery present in and around Romney; he was accompanied on this expedition by Col. Parsons' son, Isaac Parsons, Jr., and by W. V. Parsons.|$|E

25|$|During the Arameans' {{siege of}} Samaria, four leprous {{men at the}} gate asked each other why they should die there of starvation, when they might go to the Arameans, who would either save them or leave them no worse than they were. When at twilight, {{they went to the}} Arameans' camp, there was no one there, for God had made the Arameans hear chariots, horses, and a great army, and fearing the Hittites and the Egyptians, they fled, leaving their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and their camp. The lepers went into a tent, <b>ate</b> <b>and</b> drank, and carried away silver, gold, and {{clothing}} from the tents and hid it.|$|E
25|$|As they <b>ate</b> <b>and</b> ate, their {{luminous}} body {{began to}} be coated by the mud substance, formed a coarser body, then suddenly, the sun and moon were seen, so were the stars, and also Night and Day began on Earth.

So, when the materialization took place, the light faded inside their newly conceived 'body' of mud and thus the night and day became apparent to them. Then, as the night and day became apparent, seasons and years also appeared.|$|E
25|$|Film {{critics have}} cited Curly {{as the most}} popular member of the team. His childlike mannerisms and natural comedic charm (he had no {{previous}} acting experience) made him a hit with audiences, particularly children and women (the latter usually finding the trio's humor juvenile and uncouth). The fact that Curly had to shave his head for the act led him to feel unappealing to women. To mask his insecurities, he <b>ate</b> <b>and</b> drank to excess and caroused whenever the Stooges made personal appearances, which was approximately seven months of each year. His weight ballooned in the 1940s, and his blood pressure became dangerously high. Curly's wild lifestyle and constant drinking eventually {{caught up with him}} in 1945, and his performances suffered.|$|E

Over 20,000 personnel {{served on a}} Bathurst during the war: the early ships were primarily manned by reservists, {{while the majority of}} the 'Hostilities Only' personnel recruited during the war served on a Bathurst-class vessel sometime during their career. Sailors were accommodated in ten-man messdecks, which were small, poorly lit rooms that were perpetually damp from seawater and sweat. In anything but calm weather, hatches and portholes would have to be closed: sunlight and fresh air was a rarity inside the hull. Because of the conditions, high rates of sickness (particularly pneumonia and tuberculosis) were experienced. Officers slept in cabins with bunks (as opposed to hammocks), and <b>ate</b> <b>and</b> relaxed in each ship's wardroom, complete with bar and steward service. The difference in conditions between officers and sailors prompted tensions between these two groups.|$|E

60|$|After all, what {{is wanted}} in this world? Is it not that men should <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> drink, and {{read and write}}, and say their prayers?

When we talk of the advances of civilization, do we mean anything but this, that men who now <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> drink badly shall <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> drink well, and that those who cannot read and write now shall learn to do so--the prayers following, as prayers will follow upon such learning? Civilization does not consist in the eschewing of garlic or the keeping clean of a man's finger-nails. It may lead to such delicacies, and probably will do so. But the man who thinks that civilization cannot exist without them imagines that the church cannot stand without the spire. In the States of America men do <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> drink, and do read and write.|$|R

40|$|Trade-offs between {{current and}} future {{consequences}} are characteristic for the domain of health behavior. Therefore, both <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> exercising behavior could be determined by time orientation, which refers to an individual’s general orientation toward the present or the future. The main aim of this dissertation is to {{provide insight into the}} relations between time orientation <b>and</b> both <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> exercising behavior. The results of this dissertation confirm that time orientation is a shared determinant of <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> exercising behavior. Nevertheless, time orientation for food and for exercise are different constructs that, in turn, have differential relations with <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> exercising behavior. Specifically, eating behavior is mainly predicted by consideration of immediate consequences, whereas exercising behavior is mainly predicted by consideration of future consequences. In addition, these relations can be partly explained by construal level. Theoretically, the results of this dissertation contribute in various ways {{to a better understanding of}} the construct of time orientation and its relations with <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> exercising behavior. Methodologically, the results of this dissertation have several implications for the measurement of time orientation as well as the measurement of <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> exercising behavior. Practically, the results of this dissertation can be used in the development of campaigns to stimulate healthy <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> exercising behavior. Overall, the insights that have been gained in this dissertation contribute to a better understanding of individuals’ intertemporal decision making in the health domain and can ultimately be used in order to promote <b>and</b> stimulate healthy <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> exercising behavior...|$|R

500|$|A {{follow-up}} visit, in 1521, by Bishop Atwater's successor, John Longland, {{showed that}} things had not improved. Abbot Pescall rarely attended church services and, when he did, he would often bring his jester who [...] "disturbed the services with his buffoonery". The Abbot's bad example had affected the canon's behaviour, who <b>ate</b> <b>and</b> drank at improper times, failed to attend services (an average of 11 of the 25 canons attended) and roamed freely outside the abbey: visiting the town's alehouses and frequently going hunting. Two canons were also accused of [...] "incontinence". This visit revealed the abbey was severely in debt, leading the Bishop to appoint two administrators {{to oversee the}} abbey's finances.|$|E
500|$|Creeks, {{who were}} {{centered}} in modern-day Alabama and Georgia, {{were known to}} incorporate conquered tribes into their own. Some Africans escaping slavery from South Carolina and Georgia fled to Florida, lured by Spanish promises of freedom should they convert to Catholicism, and {{found their way into}} the tribe. Seminoles originally settled in the northern portion of the territory, but the 1823 Treaty of Moultrie Creek forced them to live on a [...] reservation north of Lake Okeechobee. They soon ranged farther south, where they numbered approximately 300 in the Everglades region, including bands of Miccosukees—a similar tribe who spoke a different language—who lived in The Big Cypress. Unlike the Calusa and Tequesta, the Seminole depended more on agriculture and raised domesticated animals. They hunted for what they <b>ate,</b> <b>and</b> traded with European-American settlers. They lived in structures called chickees, open-sided palm-thatched huts, probably adapted from the Calusa.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{to expand on}} the {{existing}} literature by examining {{the relationship between the}} temperament components of novelty seeking and harm avoidance and the maladaptive behaviors of disordered <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> substance abuse. A sample of 202 female undergraduates completed self-report questionnaires measuring each of the variables of interest. Alike prior research, a significant correlation was found between disordered <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> substance abuse. Moreover, regression analysis revealed that disordered <b>eating</b> positively <b>and</b> significantly predicted substance use in college-aged women. It was also hypothesized that novelty seeking and harm avoidance would moderate this relationship between disordered <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> substance use. Although novelty seeking was significantly correlated with both disordered <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> substance abuse, it was not found to moderate {{the relationship between the two}} disorders. Moreover, harm avoidance was found to be significantly correlated only to disordered <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> not to substance abuse. Although these components were not found to moderate the relationship between disordered <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> substance abuse, the positive correlation between novelty seeking with these disorders suggests a relationship to be further investigated. In addition, the predictive value of disordered eating for the development of substance abuse within a college age, nonclinical sample is asserted. Implications of these findings can be utilized by mental health professionals as well as school and university administrators. ...|$|R
