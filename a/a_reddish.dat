5|$|Neptune has a {{planetary}} ring system, though one much less substantial {{than that of}} Saturn. The rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material, which most likely gives them <b>a</b> <b>reddish</b> hue.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} Phallus species known with a pinkish-colored cap is P.rubicundus; its conical cap has a surface that is wrinkled, not reticulate. Other similar species include P.hadriani, {{which has a}} purple volva, P.macrosporus, which has <b>a</b> <b>reddish</b> volva, and P.formanosus, which has a pale pink stipe and volva.|$|E
50|$|L-type asteroids are {{relatively}} uncommon asteroids with <b>a</b> strongly <b>reddish</b> spectrum shortwards of 0.75 μm, and a featureless flat spectrum longwards of this. In {{comparison with the}} K-type, they exhibit <b>a</b> more <b>reddish</b> spectrum at visible wavelengths and a flat spectrum in the infrared.|$|R
50|$|Uppertail greenish-yellow grading into <b>a</b> broad <b>reddish</b> tip.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 35 mm. The forewings {{are very}} pale brownish grey, whiter beyond the cell {{and between the}} veins near the outer margin. At {{the end of the}} cell is <b>a</b> small <b>reddish</b> brown spot and below the median vein is <b>a</b> large <b>reddish</b> brown spot composed of long crinkly scales. The hindwings and underside are yellowish white.|$|R
5|$|Astronomers {{originally}} {{supposed that}} the entire trans-Neptunian population would show a similar red surface colour, as they were thought to have originated in the same region and subjected to the same physical processes. Specifically, SDOs were expected to have large amounts of surface methane, chemically altered into complex organic molecules by energy from the Sun. This would absorb blue light, creating <b>a</b> <b>reddish</b> hue. Most classical objects display this colour, but scattered objects do not; instead, they present a white or greyish appearance.|$|E
5|$|Both {{males and}} females have short, {{straight}} fur that is relatively dense and without spots or patterns. Both sexes are generally a reddish-brown dorsally and colored a dirty cream ventrally. When in rut, they may have an orange coloration to their abdomen from <b>a</b> <b>reddish</b> substance secreted by a chest gland secretions, but {{this has not been}} consistently observed by all researchers. The tail tends to be lighter in coloration than the sides. Juveniles are either gray or nearly white.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{is one of}} a few {{metallic}} elements with {{a natural}} color other than gray or silver. Pure copper is orange-red and acquires <b>a</b> <b>reddish</b> tarnish when exposed to air. The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells – the energy difference between these shells corresponds to orange light.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Dioscorea species. They are <b>a</b> dull <b>reddish</b> {{and have}} <b>a</b> black head.|$|R
50|$|Lactuca serriola has <b>a</b> spineless <b>reddish</b> stem, {{containing}} <b>a</b> milky latex, {{growing from}} 30 to 200 cm.|$|R
5000|$|In heraldry, murrey (...) is a [...] "stain", or a {{non-standard}} tincture, of <b>a</b> dark <b>reddish</b> purple colour.|$|R
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.rugosiceps. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle <b>a</b> <b>reddish</b> color or is unreactive, and yellow or unreactive on the flesh. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) turns the cap surface red, and the flesh yellowish to orangish. Application of iron (II) sulphate solution produces a gray color on the cap surface, and greenish-gray to olive coloration on the flesh.|$|E
5|$|The oldest beds of this {{formation}} {{belong to}} the Dinosaur Canyon Member, <b>a</b> <b>reddish,</b> slope-forming rock layer with thin beds of siltstone that are interbedded with mudstone and fine sandstone. The Dinosaur Canyon, with a local thickness of , was probably laid down in slow-moving streams, ponds and large lakes. Evidence for this is in cross-bedding of the sediments and large numbers of fish fossils.|$|E
5|$|The {{smallest}} of the red robins, the red-capped robin is 10.5–12.5cm (4–5in) long with a wingspan of 15–19.5cm (6–8in), and weighs around 7–9g (0.25–0.31oz). Males and females are of similar size. It has longer legs than the other robins of the genus Petroica. The male has a distinctive scarlet cap and breast. Its upperparts are jet black with white shoulder bars, and its tail black with white tips. The underparts and shoulder are white. All colours are sharply delineated from one another. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown above with <b>a</b> <b>reddish</b> tint to the crown, and paler underneath with dark brown wings and pale buff wing patch. Some females have <b>a</b> <b>reddish</b> tint to the breast. Both sexes have a small black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. Immature birds initially resemble the female; it is only with their second moult, which takes place at around or {{just over a year}} of age that males adopt their distinctive adult plumage. The red-capped robin moults once a year, after the breeding season which takes place between December and April.|$|E
5000|$|... is {{considered}} aesthetically superior to 'Harlequin', growing marginally higher and with flowers of <b>a</b> more <b>reddish</b> hue.|$|R
50|$|Erythrism or erythrochroism {{refers to}} <b>an</b> unusuaI <b>reddish</b> {{pigmentation}} of <b>an</b> animaI's fur, hair, skin, feathers, or eggshells.|$|R

5|$|There {{are many}} {{differences}} between SDOs and JFCs, {{even though many}} of the Jupiter-family comets may have originated in the scattered disc. Although the centaurs share <b>a</b> <b>reddish</b> or neutral coloration with many SDOs, their nuclei are bluer, indicating a fundamental chemical or physical difference. One hypothesis is that comet nuclei are resurfaced as they approach the Sun by subsurface materials which subsequently bury the older material.|$|E
5|$|At {{least in}} North America, Calostoma cinnabarinum is {{distinctive}} and easily recognizable. Two {{other species of}} Calostoma also occur in the eastern United States. C.lutescens has a thinner gelatinous layer and a predominately yellow middle layer, or mesoperidium, with the red color confined to the peristome. It also possesses a well-defined collar {{at the base of}} the spore case, a longer stipe, and globose, pitted spores. C.ravenelii is not gelatinous, but instead has warts adorning the spore case, and is smaller than C.cinnabarinum. It also has <b>a</b> <b>reddish</b> peristome but is otherwise clay-colored. Unlike C.lutescens, the spores of C.ravenelii cannot be distinguished from those of C.cinnabarinum except through the use of atomic force microscopy.|$|E
5|$|Boletus roseolateritius, {{known from}} Mississippi, has a cap that changes color {{according}} to its age: it is initially dark reddish to orangish, later reddish brown at maturity, fading to brownish orange or brownish pink with dull yellow tints, and finally turning dull dingy yellow in age. Its pale yellow stipe lacks the reddish coloration and the hairs found {{on the base of}} B.subluridellus. Microscopically, it has smaller spores, measuring 8.5–12 by 3.5–4.5μm. Boletus rufocinnamomeus is also similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its yellow stipe that is dotted with orange-cinnamon to brownish dots. Boletus flammans, another blue-bruising lookalike found in the southeastern United States, grows under conifers. It has <b>a</b> <b>reddish</b> stipe with fine reticulations on its upper half.|$|E
50|$|Resembles {{the larger}} and darker {{northern}} wheatear, but with <b>a</b> duller <b>reddish</b> breast and broader black tail tip. Sexes are alike.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 22-25 mm. It {{is similar}} to Cyclophora maderensis, but has broader wings and has <b>a</b> denser <b>reddish</b> irroration.|$|R
5000|$|Collinsia parviflora is {{an annual}} plant with <b>a</b> spindly <b>reddish</b> stem and narrow {{lance-shaped}} green leaves with edges that curl under.|$|R
5|$|In {{visible and}} {{near-infrared}} light, the rings have <b>a</b> <b>reddish</b> color, except the halo ring, which is neutral or blue in color. The {{size of the}} dust in the rings varies, but the cross-sectional area is greatest for nonspherical particles of radius about 15 μm in all rings except the halo. The halo ring is probably dominated by submicrometre dust. The total mass of the ring system (including unresolved parent bodies) is poorly known, but is probably {{in the range of}} 1011to 1016kg. The age of the ring system is not known, but it may have existed since the formation of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Myotis alcathoe is the {{smallest}} European Myotis species. The fur is brownish on the upperparts, with <b>a</b> <b>reddish</b> tone in old specimens, and a slightly paler gray-brown below. Younger animals may be completely gray-brown. The brown fur distinguishes adult M.alcathoe from other whiskered bats, but juveniles cannot be unambiguously identified {{on the basis of}} morphology. M.alcathoe is similar to Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and M.emarginatus in color. On the upper side of the body, the hairs are 6 to 8mm long and have dark bases and brown tips. The hairs on the lower side of the body are only slightly paler at the tip than at the base.|$|E
5|$|Similar fungi with simple, white fruit bodies include Clavaria acuta, {{an equally}} {{widespread}} species that typically grows singly {{or in small}} groups rather than in dense clusters and can be distinguished microscopically by its clamped basidia and larger spores; the morphologically similar, but rare C.atkinsoniana, found in the southwestern and central United States, which cannot be distinguished from C.fragilis by field characteristics alone but has larger spores—8.5–10 by 4.5–5µm; C.rubicundula, another North American species, which is similar in stature but has <b>a</b> <b>reddish</b> tint; and Multiclavula mucida, a widespread lichenized species with smaller fruit bodies that occurs with its associated algae on moist wood.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 17 mm. The forewings are pale cinereous with <b>a</b> faint <b>reddish</b> tinge. The hindwings are shining pale greyish.|$|R
5000|$|Clarkia purpurea erects <b>a</b> thin <b>reddish</b> stem {{which may}} {{approach}} 1 meter (3 ft.) in height {{and has a}} few lance-shaped leaves.|$|R
50|$|Lobachevskij is <b>a</b> {{strongly}} <b>reddish</b> {{and relatively}} uncommon L-type asteroid in the SMASS classification. It has an absolute magnitude between 11.5 and 12.4.|$|R
5|$|The first church {{built on}} the cathedral site also had a tabernacle, but its exact {{location}} is unknown. During {{the construction of the}} cathedral, the tabernacle was housed in what are now the Chapels of San Isidro and Our Lady of Agony of Granada. However, in the 18thcentury, it was decided to build a structure that was separate, but still connected, to the main cathedral. It is constructed of tezontle (<b>a</b> <b>reddish</b> porous volcanic rock) and white stone {{in the shape of a}} Greek cross with its southern facade faces the Zócalo. It is connected to the main cathedral via the Chapel of San Isidro.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is in the}} West Branch Pine Creek {{drainage}} basin, {{where the}} underlying rocks are primarily conglomerate, sandstone, and shale. Two major rock formations are present in Cherry Springs State Park, both at least partly from the Carboniferous period. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points in the park, is the early Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal. The lower formation is the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone. Outside the park the creek has cut down into the Devonian Catskill Formation, <b>a</b> <b>reddish</b> sandstone.|$|E
5|$|Two-color {{varieties}} {{always have}} a white base color with areas of the second color. Tan and white {{is the most common}} two-color variety, but there is a wide range of other colors including lemon, a very light tan; red, <b>a</b> <b>reddish,</b> almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black. Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with yellow eyes. Ticked or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different colored flecks (ticking), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue color, similar to the coloring of the Bluetick Coonhound. Some tricolor beagles also have ticking of various colors in their white areas.|$|E
50|$|Placidium acarosporoides (Mojave stipllescale) is <b>a</b> glossy <b>reddish</b> to {{dark brown}} or black squamulose lichen dotted with black perithecia that grows on rock.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 11 mm. The forewings are deep blue-purple and the hindwings are dark bronzy-grey, sometimes with <b>a</b> faint <b>reddish</b> tinge.|$|R
50|$|The bark is <b>a</b> scaly <b>reddish</b> light brown, with {{depressions}} {{caused by}} the shedding of scales of bark. Prominent buttresses form at the base.|$|R
