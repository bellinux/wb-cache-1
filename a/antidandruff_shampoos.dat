50|$|Zinc oxide {{is used as}} a weak {{antiseptic}} (and sunscreen), and in paints as a white pigment and mold-growth inhibitor. Zinc chloride is {{a common}} ingredient in mouthwashes and deodorants, and zinc pyrithione is an ingredient in <b>antidandruff</b> <b>shampoos.</b> Galvanized (zinc-coated) fittings on roofs impede the growth of algae. Copper- and zinc-treated shingles are available. Zinc iodide and zinc sulfate are used as topical antiseptics.|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{efficacy of}} <b>antidandruff</b> <b>shampoos</b> is correlated with both their anti-Malassezia nd their squamolytic activities. The sebum flow nourishing the lipophilic yeasts is another actor on the scene, fueling the skin disorder. This {{study was conducted}} in 120 men in order to quantify the effect of eight proprietary <b>antidandruff</b> <b>shampoos</b> on sebum flow dynamics. Evaluations were made using the Lipometer ©. Two shampoos exhibited a significant effect upon the sebum follicular reservoir, steadily increasing the sebum excretion rate in time. One other product induced a significant decrease in sebum output. Present data give insight into the distinct effects of shampoos on the follicular reservoir function in androgenic alopecia. The resulting sebum flow dynamics may be significantly increased or decreased by proprietary products...|$|E
40|$|Dandruff and {{seborrheic}} dermatitis form {{a continuum of}} desquamative conditions associated with the excessive colonization of the stratum corneum by yeasts of the genus Malassezia spp. Such colonization is heterogeneous in density, ranging from discrete to abundant according to the fungal ability to adhere to individual corneocytes. The rate of action of <b>antidandruff</b> <b>shampoos</b> shed some doubts about a direct antifungal effect, but rather suggests the involvement of innate immune defenses and the chemical alteration of molecular adhesion modalities between Malassezia and corneocytes.

40|$|Zinc pyrithione (ZPT) is an {{antimicrobial}} {{material with}} widespread use in <b>antidandruff</b> <b>shampoos</b> and antifouling paints. Despite decades of commercial use, {{there is little}} understanding of its antimicrobial mechanism of action. We used a combination of genome-wide approaches (yeast deletion mutants and microarrays) and traditional methods (gene constructs and atomic emission) to characterize the activity of ZPT against a model yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ZPT acts through an increase in cellular copper levels that leads to loss of activity of iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins. ZPT was also found to mediate growth inhibition through an increase in copper in the scalp fungus Malassezia globosa. A model is presented in which pyrithione acts as a copper ionophore, enabling copper to enter cells and distribute across intracellular membranes. This is the first report of a metal-ligand complex that inhibits fungal growth by increasing the cellular level of a different metal...|$|E
40|$|A {{convenient}} standard microbiological potency determination {{test for}} the <b>antidandruff</b> <b>shampoos</b> was developed by adopting the pharmacopoeial microbiological assay procedure of the drug nystatin. A standard curve was drawn consisting of the inhibition zone diameters vs. logarithm of nystatin concentrations in international units using the fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) strain National Collection of Type Culture (NCTC) 1071606 as the test organism. From the standard curve the yeast inhibitory potencies of the shampoos in nystatin international unit equivalents were determined from the respective inhibition zones of the test samples of the shampoos. Under test conditions four shampoo samples showed remarkable fungal inhibitory potencies of 10227, 10731, 12396 and 18211 nystatin international unit equivalents/ml while two shampoo samples had extremely feeble inhibitory potencies 4. 07 and 4. 37 nystatin international unit equivalents/ml although the latter two products claimed antifungal activity. The potency determination method {{could be applied to}} any antidandruff shampoo with any one or a combination of active ingredients...|$|E

40|$|Dandruff {{is known}} to be {{controlled}} by fungistatic shampoos active against Malassezia spp. These products also remove the loosely attached scales. This study was performed to assess the effect of a 5 -min residence time on the efficacy of <b>antidandruff</b> <b>shampoos.</b> Two commercially available shampoos were used in two groups of 21 panelists with severe dandruff. They contained either 1 % ketoconazole or 1 % piroctone olamine. In each group, intraindividual comparisons were made by a split-scalp design between the effect of a 5 -min residence time versus no residence time. Both shampoos induced significant reductions in scaliness and yeast colonization. The beneficial effects were obvious immediately after one single shampooing and 3 days later as well. The improvement was greater with a 5 -min residence time. The piroctone olamine treatment benefited more than the ketoconazole treatment from the extension of shampoo-exposure time. In conclusion, the benefit of a residence time in treating dandruff is documented. The level of improvement in efficacy may vary according {{to the nature of the}} shampoo. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|With {{dandruff}} being {{a common}} everyday {{problem and the}} market loaded with <b>antidandruff</b> <b>shampoos</b> and such skin care products, it is obvious to assume resourceful research into this area would be both objective to present scenario and lucrative potentially. Nanoparticles are frequently in use in some very powerful antimicrobial, antifungal cosmetics nowadays especially silver. However most metallic nanoparticles are harsh and often toxic, and concern remains on their ill effects. Sulphur, certified as biocompatible to eukaryotes and as soil nutrient is often used in medicine. Though sulphur nanoparticles are not much worked with it still is a strong antifungal agent and {{have been used in}} macro amount in shampoos. Our work concentrates on synthesizing sulphur nanoparticles in a surfactant system, insitu, such that it could possibly be used in curbing dandruff naturally. A surfactant has some natural antimicrobial property and therefore such combination could be a potential antidandruff hair washing formulation. To check its antidandruff activity, experiments have been conducted on Malassezia furfur the causal organism for seborrheaic dermatitis or dandruff, which have been cultured for such study in our lab. Spectroscopy based microbial growth kinetics and colony inhibition studies have been performed to show that nanoparticles of sulphur reduce proliferation of Malassezia yeast colonies abundantly, and cause cellular damage which inhibit its growth and viability considerably...|$|E
40|$|Pyrithione is {{a general}} {{inhibitor}} of membrane transport in fungi and is widely used in <b>antidandruff</b> <b>shampoos</b> as an antifungal agent. An electrophysiological approach {{has been used to}} determine the mode of action of pyrithione on the plasma membrane of the model ascomycete, Neurospora crassa. At pH 5. 8, pyrithione induces a dramatic dose-dependent electrical depolarization of the membrane which is complete within 4 min, amounts to 110 mV at saturating pyrithione concentrations, and is half maximal between 0. 6 and 0. 8 mM pyrithione. Zinc pyrithione induces a similar response but exerts a half-maximal effect at around 0. 3 mM. The depolarization is strongly dependent on external pH, being almost absent at pH 8. 2, at which the concentration of the uncharged form of pyrithione [...] which might be expected to permeate the membrane freely [...] is markedly lowered. However, quantitative considerations based on cytosolic buffer capacity, the pKa of pyrithione, and the submillimolar concentration at which it is active appear to preclude significant cytosolic acidification on dissociation of the thiol proton from the uncharged form of pyrithione. Current-voltage analysis demonstrates that the depolarization is accompanied by a decrease in membrane electrical conductance {{in a manner consistent with}} inhibition of the primary proton pump and inconsistent with a mode of action of pyrithione on plasma membrane ion channels. We conclude that pyrithione inhibits membrane transport via a direct or indirect effect on the primary proton pump which energizes transport and that the site of action of pyrithione is likely to be intra- rather than extracellular...|$|E
40|$|The {{differentiated}} epidermis {{of human}} skin {{serves as an}} essential barrier against environmental insults from physical, chemical, and biological sources. Zinc pyrithione (ZnPT) is an FDA-approved microbicidal agent used worldwide in clinical antiseptic products, over-the-counter topical antimicrobials, and cosmetic consumer products including <b>antidandruff</b> <b>shampoos.</b> Here we demonstrate {{for the first time}} that cultured primary human skin keratinocytes and melanocytes display an exquisite vulnerability to nanomolar concentrations of ZnPT resulting in pronounced induction of heat shock response gene expression and impaired genomic integrity. In keratinocytes treated with nanomolar concentrations of ZnPT, expression array analysis revealed massive upregulation of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPA 6, HSPA 1 A, HSPB 5, HMOX 1, HSPA 1 L, and DNAJA 1) further confirmed by immunodetection. Moreover, ZnPT treatment induced rapid depletion of cellular ATP levels and formation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymers. Consistent with an involvement of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in ZnPT-induced energy crisis, ATP depletion could be antagonized by pharmacological inhibition of PARP. This result was independently confirmed using PARP- 1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts that were resistant to ATP depletion and cytotoxicity resulting from ZnPT exposure. In keratinocytes and melanocytes, single-cell gel electrophoresis and flow cytometric detection of γ-H 2 A. X revealed rapid induction of DNA damage in response to ZnPT detectable before general loss of cell viability occurred through caspase-independent pathways. Combined with earlier experimental evidence that documents penetration of ZnPT through mammalian skin, our findings raise the possibility that this topical antimicrobial may target and compromise keratinocytes and melanocytes in intact human skin...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from SPIE via the DOI in this record. Treatment of {{dandruff}} condition usually involves use of <b>antidandruff</b> <b>shampoos</b> containing antifungal agents. Different antifungal agents show variable clinical efficacy based on their cutaneous distribution and bioavailability. Using stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), we mapped the distribution of unlabeled low-molecular weight antifungal compounds zinc pyrithione (ZnPT) and climbazole (CBZ) on the surface of intact porcine skin with cellular precision. SRS has sufficient chemical selectivity and sensitivity to detect the agents on the skin surface based on their unique chemical motifs that do not occur naturally in biological tissues. Moreover, SRS is able to correlate the distribution of the agents with the morphological features of the skin using the CH 2 CH 2 stretch mode, which is abundant in skin lipids. This is a significant strength of the technique since it allows the microscopic accumulation of the agents to be correlated with physiological features and their chemical environment without the use of counter stains. Our findings show that due to its lower solubility, ZnPT coats the surface of the skin with a sparse layer of crystals in the size range of 1 to 4 [*][*]μm 4 [*][*]μm. This is consistent with the current understanding of the mode of action of ZnPT. In contrast, CBZ being more soluble and hydrophobic resulted in diffuse homogeneous distribution. It predominantly resided in microscopic lipid-rich crevasses and penetrated up to 60 [*][*]μm 60 [*][*]μm into the infundibular spaces surrounding the hair shaft. The ability of the SRS to selectively map the distribution of agents on the skin’s surface has the potential to provide insight into the mechanisms underpinning the topical application of antifungal or skin-active agents that could lead to the rational engineering of enhanced formulations.
