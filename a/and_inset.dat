5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome <b>and</b> <b>inset</b> arches like Royal Arches.|$|E
25|$|The 1968 XT model {{featured}} a mild facelift, with a divided grille, <b>and</b> <b>inset</b> driving lights for the GT. The GT also replaced the thick lower body stripes of the XR with narrow stripes along the waistline from grille to tail light. The tail lights were still round, {{but instead of}} the small round indicator of the XR, the XT model had a long indicator across the light. Otherwise, all external body panels and bumpers {{were the same as}} the XR.|$|E
25|$|The UK {{version of}} the vehicle was {{intended}} {{to fit into the}} Vauxhall range below the Viva, and was initially presented only in its hatchback version, a style that became very popular during the 1970s. With its Pontiac-inspired 'shovel nose' <b>and</b> <b>inset</b> headlamps, the UK version looked radically different from the Opel Kadett and was accepted by the motoring public as a completely new car; when the saloon, estate car and van variants appeared and the hatchback was added to the Kadett lineup the common lineage became apparent. The Chevette was the first British-built hatchback of this size,; Ford did not respond with a similar product until the following year (their similar-sized offerings all having conventional rear boots).|$|E

No. 31 is largely 19th century, incorporating older buildings <b>and</b> <b>inset</b> with medieval elements.

500|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 16th century, the living of Old Sleaford became [...] "extremely poor" [...] and its church {{probably}} fell out of use. Some time afterwards, the rector of Quarrington obtained a presentation to Old Sleaford, but, discovering the lack of tithes, he left. Robert Carre convinced him to take in the parishioners of Old Sleaford at Quarrington in return for a yearly payment; as of 2015, the parishes are still combined. Amendments to the fabric of the church were made in the early modern period, beginning when the chancel was rebuilt on a smaller scale some time after the Reformation <b>and</b> <b>inset</b> with 12th- and 13th-century stonework, the whole thing described as [...] "very miserable" [...] by Edward Trollope. This was replaced in 1812 by a Georgian-style chancel, constructed under the guidance of the rector, Charles James Blomfield. The North Aisle was rebuilt in 1848 and a new pulpit, screen and pews were added the following year.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of jewellery in the 6th-7th century made intensive use of flat, cut almandine garnets {{in gold and}} garnet cloisonné (or [...] "cellwork") but occasionally glass was also cut <b>and</b> <b>inset</b> as gems. The colours used were almost entirely limited to blue and green. Occasionally red glass {{has been used as}} a substitute for garnet, for example in some of the Sutton Hoo objects, such as the purse-lid and blue glass in the shoulder clasps. The 7th-century Forsbrook Pendant also mixes garnet and blue glass inlays. Anglo-Saxon enamel was also used in the production of jewellery, with coloured glass melted in separate cells.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} pyramids known in Mesoamerica, the Great Pyramid is [...] high and contains an estimated 100,000 cubic meters of earth fill. The current conical shape of the pyramid was once thought to represent nearby volcanoes or mountains, but recent work by Rebecca Gonzalez Lauck {{has shown that the}} pyramid was in fact a rectangular pyramid with stepped sides <b>and</b> <b>inset</b> corners, and the current shape is most likely due to 2500 years of erosion. The pyramid itself has never been excavated, but a magnetometer survey in 1967 found an anomaly high {{on the south side of}} the pyramid. Speculation ranges from a section of burned clay to a cache of buried offerings to a tomb.|$|E
