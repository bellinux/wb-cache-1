25|$|During the Iran–Iraq War, the two Bushehr {{reactors}} {{were damaged}} by multiple Iraqi air strikes {{and work on}} the nuclear program came to a standstill. Iran notified the International Atomic Energy Agency of the blasts, and complained <b>about</b> <b>international</b> inaction and the use of French made missiles in the attack. In late 2015, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani revealed that Iran considered pursuing weapons of mass destruction during the war against Iraq.|$|E
25|$|The England {{national}} rugby union {{team had}} been playing international matches since 1871, {{but it was not}} until 1904, nine years after the formation of the new code, that an international rugby league match was played. At the start of 1903 season the Northern Union thought <b>about</b> <b>international</b> matches and scheduled a match for England on New Year's Day 1904 in Oldham. On that day though, the ground was frosty and the match was cancelled and it was rescheduled for April.|$|E
25|$|Not surprisingly, {{those who}} are high in global human {{identification}} are less prejudiced toward many groups, care more <b>about</b> <b>international</b> human rights, worldwide inequality, global poverty and human suffering. They attend more actively to global concerns, value {{the lives of all}} human beings more equally, and give more in time and money to international humanitarian causes. They tend to be more politically liberal on both domestic and international issues. They want their countries to do more to alleviate global suffering.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, Lynn and Vanhanen {{followed}} IQ and the Wealth of Nations {{with their}} book IQ and Global Inequality, which contained additional data and analyses, {{but the same}} general conclusions as the earlier book. Discussing both books, Earl Hunt writes that although Lynn and Vanhanen's methodology and conclusions are questionable, they deserve credit for raising important questions <b>about</b> <b>international</b> IQ comparisons. Hunt writes that Lynn and Vanhanen are correct that national IQs correlate strongly with measures of social well-being, but they are unjustified in their rejection {{of the idea that}} national IQs could change as a result of improved education.|$|E

Then, at the General Assembly, each resolution is discussed and voted on. It is also the National Selection Conference of EYP Turkey, which is also recognized by the international office of European Youth Parliament. The conference is held annually and is organized by the Robert College European Youth Club.|$|E
25|$|Laws {{governing}} the material support of terrorism proved contentious. It was {{criticized by the}} EFF for infringement of freedom of association. The EFF argues that had this law been enacted during Apartheid, U.S. citizens {{would not have been}} able to support the African National Congress (ANC) as the EFF believes the ANC would have been classed as a terrorist organization. They also used the example of a humanitarian social worker being unable to train Hamas members how to care for civilian children orphaned in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, a lawyer being unable to teach IRA members <b>about</b> <b>international</b> law, and peace workers being unable to offer training in effective peace negotiations or how to petition the United Nations regarding human rights abuses.|$|E

25|$|Concerns <b>about</b> <b>international</b> {{conflict}} and the first stages of the World War II stretched {{throughout most of the}} Second National Assembly. In 1940, the National Assembly declared a state of national emergency which gave the President extensive emergency powers. On December 8, 1941, Japan attacked the Philippines a few hours after attacking Pearl Harbor. The National Assembly lost no time in enacting substantive legislation diverting all remaining funds for national defense and declaring a state of total emergency. It furthered the emergency powers already granted to the President, such as the transfer of the seat of government and the extension of the effectivity of lapsing laws. In its last act, the National Assembly certified the results of the 1941 elections where Manuel L. Quezon and Sergio Osmeña were reelected as president and vice president, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Knesset member Moshe Erem {{accused the}} army of {{excessive}} force, a charge that Prime Minister Ben Gurion denied. He also defended the policy of expulsions. Foreign Minister Sharett, concerned <b>about</b> <b>international</b> reaction, argued {{that there should be}} more searches with fewer people being deported at one time and then only adult males. One of the issues causing concern in this case was that some of those expelled had been resident in Abu Ghosh for over a year. In the wake of public pressure, the vast majority of villagers were allowed to return. In July 1952, MK Beba Idelson objected to the deportation of an Abu Ghosh woman, who was said to have cancer, and her four children. The police minister Bechor-Shalom Sheetrit rejected the claim that the woman had cancer. The village remained under martial law until 1966.|$|E
25|$|The Ebola {{outbreak}}, {{which was}} the 26th outbreak since 1976, started in Guinea in March 2014. The WHO warned {{that the number of}} Ebola patients could rise to 20,000, and said that it used $489m (£294m) to contain Ebola within six to nine months. The outbreak was accelerating. Medecins sans Frontieres has just opened a new Ebola hospital in Monrovia, and after one week it is already a capacity of 120 patients. It said that the number of patients seeking treatment at its new Monrovia centre was increasing faster than they could handle both {{in terms of the number}} of beds and the capacity of the staff, adding that it was struggling to cope with the caseload in the Liberian capital. Lindis Hurum, MSF's emergency coordinator in Monrovia, said that it was humanitarian emergency and they needed a full-scale humanitarian response. Brice de la Vinge, MSF director of operations, said that it was not until five months after the declaration of the Ebola outbreak that serious discussions started <b>about</b> <b>international</b> leadership and coordination, and said that it was not acceptable.|$|E

Like the station's general manager, Alfred Kemsley, Blamey felt that Australians were poorly informed <b>about</b> <b>international</b> affairs, {{and set about}} raising awareness of matters that he believed would soon impact them greatly. He was appalled at Nazi Germany's persecution of Jews, and saw a clear and growing menace to world peace from Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan. His 15-minute weekly talks continued {{until the end of}} September 1939, by which time the war that he had warned was coming had started.|$|E

During the Qatar trip, Obama had intended to visit Jordan as well, but the trip was canceled due to weather conditions.
