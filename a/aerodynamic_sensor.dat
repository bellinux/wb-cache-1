40|$|In 2007, the NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) {{chartered}} the NASA Engineering Safety Center (NESC) {{to demonstrate}} an alternate launch abort concept as risk mitigation for the Orion project's baseline "tower" design. On July 8, 2009, a full scale and passively, aerodynamically stabilized MLAS launch abort demonstrator was successfully launched from Wallops Flight Facility following {{nearly two years}} of development work on the launch abort concept: from a napkin sketch to a flight demonstration of the full-scale flight test vehicle. The MLAS flight test vehicle was instrumented with a suite of aerodynamic sensors. The purpose was to obtain sufficient data {{to demonstrate that the}} vehicle demonstrated the behavior predicted by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis and wind tunnel testing. This paper describes development of the Air Data Boom (ADB) component of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>sensor</b> suite...|$|E
40|$|There remain large {{regions of}} {{scientific}} {{interest in the}} Antarctic that are not instrumented. These include highly dynamic ice streams and glaciers that are difficult or impossible to reach safely because heavy crevassing impedes an overland trek or an aircraft landing. We have developed an alternative strategy for instrumenting these regions: an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>sensor</b> that can be dropped from an overflying aircraft. During freefall the sensor accelerates to its terminal velocity of 42 m sâ€“ 1 before impacting with the glacier. On impact it partially buries itself in the snow while leaving an antenna mast protruding high above the surface to ensure a long operating life. In this paper, we describe the design and results of testing this aircraft-deployable sensor. Finally we present the initial results of two campaigns to instrument inaccessible regions of Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica, and Scar Inlet, Antarctic Peninsula, with GPS receivers...|$|E

Altitude, speed, and advanced active and passive sensors allow the aircraft to spot targets at considerable ranges and increase weapons range; altitude and speed also complement stealth's ability to increase the aircraft's survivability against ground defenses such as surface-to-air missiles.|$|R

40|$|In {{the frame}} of the German - Japanese EXPRESS {{cooperation}} MAN Technologie AG submits a proposal for MALAR (MAN LAVOCHKIN Reentry Capsule), a reentry spacecraft designed by the Russian space industry company LAVOCHKIN Association in Moscow. The spacecraft is integrated from space proven components and based on experience of numerous scientific satellite missions including reentry capabilities on earth and planets. MALAR features a common approach of LAVOCHKIN and MAN: The first provides all mechanical parts and power supply, MAN provides electronics like GNC, TTC and OBDH. MALAR consists of a spherical reentry capsule and an expendable orbital service modul. The capsule houses the experiments, thermal control if necessary, data handling, parachute for landing and power supply for experiments during reentry and landing. The capsule outer surface is protected by proven heatshield material. The orbital module integrates propulsion, guidance-navigation-control, telecommunication and power supply. It provides the interface to the launcher. The EXPRESS-Programme payload requirements can be met in full with at least 165 kg capacity and generous volume provision by MALAR. Microgravity experiments will present no problem, <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>sensors</b> and heatshield sample inserts can be introduced into the capsule outside surface in negotiations with the deliverer. The ISAS scientific cooperation may take place in the project as indicated by DARA as far as foreign responsibilities are not disturbed. MALAR is ready to be launched by M 3 S II and will be accommodated for launch in August 1994. Summarizing, MALAR presents a tailored quasi space proven reentry capsule system, which includes no drawback to operational goals of the initial EXPRESS-Programme, because {{there is no need for}} a compromise to be made in modification of 'unsuitable' existing spacecraft.

The techniques were developed and validated in a high-fidelity fixed-base flight simulator using a wind-tunnel <b>aerodynamic</b> database, realistic <b>sensor</b> characteristics, and a realistic flight deck representative of a large transport aircraft.

40|$|Even {{under the}} most unfortunate circumstances, NASA {{continues}} on a path of innovation. After the Space Shuttle Columbia reentered the atmosphere on February 1, 2003, it experienced a catastrophic failure, and the entire crew and vehicle were lost. For the two weeks prior to the accident, Columbia STS- 107 was {{on a mission to}} perform physical, life, and space sciences research in the unique environment of microgravity. Following the accident, the remaining shuttles - Endeavor, Atlantis, and Discovery - were grounded, and an intense investigation ensued. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board spent nearly 7 months examining the cause of the accident and determining what would ensure a safe return to flight. To this end, investigators performed an extensive review down five analytic paths: <b>aerodynamic,</b> thermodynamic, <b>sensor</b> data timeline, debris reconstruction, and imaging. As part of the evaluation of all the available imagery from Columbia's ascent, orbit, and entry, investigators needed a new method for analyzing still video images to determine the size of the material that fell from Columbia, as well as the distance that the material traveled. John Lane, a scientist at Kennedy Space Center, devised a software program to calculate the unknown dimension of the material in the images, and soon after the investigation was complete, continued to enhance the technology. Eventually, the program that assisted in the Columbia investigation became available for licensing...|$|R
40|$|A unique {{approach}} for obtaining vehicle aerodynamic characteristics during entry {{has been developed}} for the Space Shuttle. This {{is due to the}} high cost of Shuttle testing, the need to open constraints for operational flights, and the fact that all flight regimes are flown starting with the first flight. Because of uncertainties associated with predicted aerodynamic coefficients, nine flight conditions have been identified at which control problems could occur. A detailed test plan has been developed for testing at these conditions and is presented. Due to limited testing, precise computer initiated maneuvers are implemented. These maneuvers are designed to optimize the vehicle motion for determining <b>aerodynamic</b> coefficients. Special <b>sensors</b> and atmospheric measurements are required to provide stability and control flight data during an entire entry. The techniques employed in data reduction are proven programs developed and used at NASA/DFRC...|$|R
40|$|NASA ARC has {{conducted}} flight tests {{of a new}} type of <b>aerodynamic</b> pressure <b>sensor</b> based on a luminescent surface coating. Flights were conducted at the NASA ARC-Dryden Flight Research Facility. The luminescent pressure sensor is based on a surface coating which, when illuminated with ultraviolet light, emits visible light with an intensity dependent on the local air pressure on the surface. This technique makes it possible to obtain pressure data over the entire surface of an aircraft, as opposed to conventional instrumentation, which can only make measurements at pre-selected points. The objective of the flight tests was to evaluate the effectiveness and practicality of a luminescent pressure sensor in the actual flight environment. A luminescent pressure sensor was installed on a fin, the Flight Test Fixture (FTF), that is attached to the underside of an F- 104 aircraft. The response of one particular surface coating was evaluated at low supersonic Mach numbers (M = 1. 0 - 1. 6) in order to provide an initial estimate of the sensor's capabilities. This memo describes the test approach, the techniques used, and the pressure sensor's behavior under flight conditions. A direct comparison between data provided by the luminescent pressure sensor and that produced by conventional pressure instrumentation shows that the luminescent sensor can provide quantitative data under flight conditions. However, the test results also show that the sensor has a number of limitations which must be addressed if this technique is to prove useful in the flight environment...|$|R

40|$|Air Data Computer (ADC) as an {{autonomous}} system consisting of primary <b>aerodynamic</b> parameters <b>sensors,</b> evaluator and indexes, {{widely used in}} aviation technology, because {{of its ability to}} unite in itself all the gauges and indicators in a single system, eliminating duplication and inconsistency information. During the ADC safety analysis we will understand the definition of reliability, which is necessary to calculate, develop functional circuit reliability, based on the analysis of the elements of the system; mathematical model that fully binds the reliability of the system, reliability indices of elements, performance calculation reliability analysis results, adjustments calculated model and system structure. There are many works devoted by methods of reliability analysis. However, in affordable authors of literature, considered analysis of the structural circuit reliability, and fault tree analysis has not acquired adequate coverage. Purpose is to develop an ADC aircraft method of comprehensive analysis of reliability based association analysis block diagram of a system based on its functional circuit graph states its renewable and non-renewable elements, further development of the ADC mathematical model of reliability and method of construction and fault tree analysis. In this paper we examined qualitative and quantitative analysis of fault tree. The purpose of qualitative analysis is to determine the minimum cross section of tree failures identified for specific major events in the system. Minimum cross-sections - a set of elements, simultaneous translation of a working state to invalid causes failure of the system. The purpose of quantitative analysis is to build analytic function of reliability F(t), and features derived probability of failure P(t), the probability of failure of function P(t), probability density function f(t) and failure rate ?(t) for an aircraft ADC. And in particular obtained time dependent analysis of reliability and unreliability blocks. Viewed method allows a comprehensive analysis of system reliability without compiling complex systems of equations.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about modelling, design {{and control of}} Miniature Flying Robots (MFR) {{with a focus on}} Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) systems and specifically, micro quadrotors. It {{introduces}} a mathematical model for simulation and control of such systems. It then describes a design methodology for a miniature rotorcraft. The methodology is subsequently applied to design an autonomous quadrotor named OS 4. Based on the mathematical model, linear and nonlinear control techniques are used to design and simulate various controllers along this work. The dynamic model and the simulator evolved from a simple set of equations, valid only for hovering, to a complex mathematical model with more realistic <b>aerodynamic</b> coefficients and <b>sensor</b> and actuator models. Two platforms were developed during this thesis. The first one is a quadrotor-like test-bench with off-board data processing and power supply. It was used to safely and easily test control strategies. The second one, OS 4, is a highly integrated quadrotor with on-board data processing and power supply. It has all the necessary sensors for autonomous operation. Five different controllers were developed. The first one, based on Lyapunov theory, was applied for attitude control. The second and the third controllers are based on PID and LQ techniques. These were compared for attitude control. The fourth and the fifth approaches use backstepping and sliding-mode concepts. They are applied to control attitude. Finally, backstepping is augmented with integral action and proposed as a single tool to design attitude, altitude and position controllers. This approach is validated through various flight experiments conducted on the OS 4...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} were to design and construct a high speed turbocharger test rig (TTR) to measure dynamics of differing turbocharger rotor bearing systems {{and to develop a}} coupled rotor-cartridge model for the ball bearing rotor system to corroborate the experimental and analytical results. The ball bearing rotor is supported by an angular contact ball bearing cartridge. In order to achieve the {{objectives of}} the experimental aspect of this study, a TTR was designed and developed with the capability of reaching speeds in excess of 100, 000 rpm driven by compressed air. The TTR was used to compare and contrast the whirl and friction characteristics of two identical turbochargers differing only by the support structure of the rotor system; one containing a floating ring bearing turbocharger (FRBT) and the other a ball bearing turbocharger (BBT). A pair of displacement sensors was installed to measure the whirl of the rotor {{near the end of the}} compressor. The BBT was shown to be significantly more rigid and stable as compared to the FRBT with an average reduction in radial rotor motion of 47 %. The motion of the BBT consisted of mainly synchronous motion whereas the FRBT was dominated by subsynchronous motion throughout the entire range of speeds. The TTR was also used to compare frictional losses within the bearings. A study of run-down times after the pressurized air supply was removed indicated that the BBT has significantly lower frictional losses under all operating conditions tested with an average increase in run-down time of 14. 1 %. ^ A wireless telemetry based temperature sensor was designed specifically for the turbocharger ball bearing system to monitor the internal bearing temperature located on the cage during operation. It was shown to be able to withstand the harsh environments of turbocharger fnapplications operating at high speeds. The sensor accurately monitored transient bearing cage temperature due to changes in operating speed. ^ Custom sensors were developed in order to measure the axial forces acting on the rotor due to <b>aerodynamic</b> effects. The <b>sensors</b> utilized cantilever beams outfitted with strain gages to measure the applied load from the bearing cartridge. Results of dynamic testing indicated the magnitude and direction of the axial force is dependent on the operating conditions of the turbine and compressor. ^ To achieve the objectives of the analytical investigation, the explicit finite element method (EFEM) and the discrete element method (DEM) were coupled to investigate dynamics of flexible rotor systems supported by deep groove ball bearings. DEM was used to develop the dynamic bearing model (DBM) in which all of the components of the bearing (i. e. races, balls, and cage) have six degrees-of-freedom. The flexible shaft was modeled with a full 3 D elastic formulation using the EFEM. Rotor and inner races of the bearings were fully coupled such that both translation and rotation of the flexible rotor are transmitted to the bearings. The resulting reaction forces and moments calculated in DBM were in turn applied to the nodes of the shaft. The combined rotor-bearing model was used to investigate the motions of the inner races at low speeds and the resulting reaction forces and moments from the supporting bearings due to a large applied load on the shaft. In the current coupled modeling approach, the deformation of the shaft affected the internal components of the bearing by altering the orientation of the inner race which results in ball spin and slip. The preceding rotor-bearing model was extended to represent the turbocharger rotor-cartridge system that is under consideration. A DEM angular contact ball bearing cartridge model was coupled with an EFEM shaft to simulate the dynamics of the turbocharger test rig. The bearing cartridge consists of a common outer ring, a pair of split inner races, and a row of balls on each end of the cartridge. The coupled rotor-cartridge model was used to investigate the shaft motion and bearing dynamics as the system traverses critical speeds. The analytical and experimental shaft motion results were in close agreement. The cartridge model allowed for thorough investigation of bearing component dynamics. Effects of ball material properties were found to have a significant impact on turbocharger rotor and bearing dynamics. ...|$|R
