5000|$|The CysLT-induced {{activation}} of CysLTR2 induces {{many of the}} same in vitro responses of cells involved in allergic reactions as well as the in vivo allergic responses in animal models as that induced by CysLT-induced CysLTR1 (see Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1#Receptor. However, CysLT2 requires 10-fold higher concentrations of LTD4, the most potent cysLT for CysLTR1, to activate CysLTR2. Furthermore, the allergic and hypersensitivity responses of humans and animal models are significantly reduced by chronic treatment with Montelukast, Zafirlukast, and Pranlukast, drugs which are selective receptor antagonists of CysLTR1 but not CysLTR2. Models of allergic reactions in Cysltr2-deficient mice as well as in a human mast cell line indicate that mouse Cysltr2 and its human homolog CysLTR2 act to inhibit Cysltr1 and CysLTR1, respectively, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>suggest</b> that CysLTR2 may similarly inhibit CysLTR1 in human allergic diseases. [...] The role of CysLTR2 in the allergic and hypersensitivity diseases of humans must await the development of selective CysLTR2 inhibitors.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{dispute over}} the {{authenticity}} of the passage between John 7:53 and 8:11, known as the Pericope adulterae or Pericope de Adultera. It appears in the King James Version but modern English translations note that it is not present in the most reliable early manuscripts of John, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>suggest</b> that it is unlikely to {{have been part of the}} original text. Until recently, it was not thought that any Greek Church Father had taken note of the passage before the 12th century; but in 1941 a large collection of the writings of Didymus the Blind (ca. 313- 398) was discovered in Egypt, including a reference to the pericope adulterae as being found in [...] "several copies", and it is now considered established that this passage was present in its usual place in some Greek manuscripts known in Alexandria and elsewhere from the 4th century onwards. In support of this it is noted that the 4th century Codex Vaticanus, which was written in Egypt, marks the end of John chapter 7 with an [...] "umlaut", indicating that an alternative reading was known at this point.|$|E
5000|$|Porter {{has argued}} that the speech was never {{actually}} delivered in court but was [...] "a particularly sophisticated form of practical rhetorical exercise— a fictional speech based upon a fictional case, designed not only to instruct and delight but, quite probably, to advertise the logographer’s skill." [...] He bases this on five grounds. Firstly, the speech is roughly half the length of comparable speeches concerning murder charges like Antiphon 5 and 6 and Lysias 12 and 13. Secondly, Philetos and Eratosthenes are [...] "curiously generic" [...] - the speech offers almost none of the details about Eratosthenes moral failings or Euphiletos' virtues that such speeches usually include. Thirdly, Porter argues that the litigants' names match their roles in the drama <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>suggest</b> they are fictional: Euphiletos means [...] "beloved," [...] while Eratosthenes means [...] "vigorous in love." [...] The latter name is also exceptionally rare in Athens. Fourthly, Porter argues that the dependence of the narrative on comic tropes suggests that it is fictional. Finally, Porter argues that the speech focuses excessively on the diegesis, giving little attention to matters that would be important if Euphiletos were a real defendant facing the death penalty. For instance, Euphiletos' arguments against premeditation are fairly weak and are not supported by calling on witnesses.|$|E
5000|$|VDAC1 {{allows for}} the {{conductance}} of molecules {{into and out of}} the mitochondrion. Its permeability is dependent on VDAC1's conformational state which is determined by voltage. At low voltage (10mV), the pore is in an [...] "open" [...] state where the channel is weakly anion selective and allows for a greater flux of metabolites. Because of the large pore size, metabolic gating under saturated ATP conditions reveal a transport of 2,000,000 ATP/second and a transport of 10,000 ATP under physiological conditions. At a higher voltage in the positive or negative direction (>30mV), the pore is in a [...] "closed" [...] state and is weakly cation selective allowing for less metabolites to be transported. The flux of metabolites can be seen as negligible.This change in states is mediated by a conformational change in the protein that has yet to be discovered. Since the alpha helical N-terminus segment is located in the center of the pore, it is ideally situated for metabolic gating. This lead researchers to believe that the Alpha helix was a key contributor to determining the conformational states. However, more recent studies have shown the N-terminal is unnecessary for proper voltage gating <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>suggest</b> the flexible beta barrel as the mechanism of conformational change.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{closely related}} lep paralogues in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). [...] A single lep gene has been {{documented}} for green-spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus). In other species {{there are reports of}} two closely related lep paralogues, including common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and Atlantic salmon. More distantly related lep genes have been found in medaka (Oryzias latipes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio). At least 2 leptin genes (lepa and lepb) exist in the crown-clade (Fig. 1). Early findings have shown that lepa and lepb share low interspecies aa identity, and are argued to have arisen through whole genome duplication, which occurred early in the teleost lineage. The duplicity of genes has been described for Atlantic salmon, Japanese medaka, common carp and zebrafish. Both lep paralogues cluster with lepa, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>suggest</b> that at least one or more form (lepb) may exist in this species, since it is tetraploid. [...] However, previous attempts using genomic synteny have only found the putative genomic duplicates in medaka and zebrafish paralogue.
