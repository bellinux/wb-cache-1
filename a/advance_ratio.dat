A conceptual propeller was designed and its performance analysed within a time-stepped mission simulation code. Wind tunnel tests were carried out on a scaled model of the propeller comparing actual performance against theoretical predictions. The design method was shown to be capable of producing a propeller design that could provide sufficient thrust over a large range of <b>advance</b> <b>ratios</b> (0. 12 to 0. 4) and altitudes (0 to 15 000 m).

The inflow distortion effect on the rotor angle of attack distribution was determined directly from the on-blade measurements, and was found to minimally affect the angle of attack at the blade tips and lower the angle attack in the rotor disk plane as the radial location moves towards the hub. A narrow, sharp increase in angle of attack as the rotor blades approached the wall was also observed, indicating blade interaction with flow reversal.

40|$|The rotor blade-vortex {{interaction}} {{problem and}} the resulting impulsive airloads which generate undesirable noise levels are discussed. A numerical lifting surface method to predict unsteady aerodynamic forces induced on a finite aspect ratio rectangular wing by a straight, free vortex placed at an arbitrary angle in a subsonic incompressible free stream is developed first. Using a rigid wake assumption, the wake vortices are assumed to move downsteam with the free steam velocity.

The predicted unsteady load distributions on the model rotor blade are generally in agreement with the experimental results. This method has also been extended to full scale rotor flight cases in which vortex induced loads near the tip of a rotor blade were indicated. In both the model and the full scale rotor blade airload calculations a flat planar wake was assumed which is a good approximation at large <b>advance</b> <b>ratios</b> because the downwash is small in comparison to the free stream at large <b>advance</b> <b>ratios.</b> The large fluctuations in the measured airloads near the tip of the rotor blade on the advance side is predicted closely by the vortex lattice method...|$|R

A quick estimate of lag mode damping was provided by a refined moving-block analysis implemented in real time which predicted similar damping values. Model rotor and blade properties were also determined, and these properties were used as inputs for a newly refined bearingless rotor analysis.

50|$|A well-designed {{propeller}} typically has {{an efficiency}} of around 80% when {{operating in the}} best regime. The efficiency of the propeller {{is influenced by the}} angle of attack (α). This is defined as α = Φ - θ, where θ is the helix angle (the angle between the resultant relative velocity and the blade rotation direction) and Φ is the blade pitch angle. Very small pitch and helix angles give a good performance against resistance but provide little thrust, while larger angles have the opposite effect. The best helix angle is when the blade is acting as a wing producing much more lift than drag. Angle of attack is similar to <b>advance</b> <b>ratio,</b> for propellers.|$|E
5000|$|Cyclorotors {{can produce}} lift and thrust at high advance ratios, which, in theory, would enable a {{cyclogyro}} aircraft to fly at subsonic speeds well exceeding those of single rotor helicopters. Single rotor helicopters {{are limited in}} forward speed {{by a combination of}} retreating blade stall and sonic blade tip constraints. As helicopters fly forward, the tip of the advancing blade experiences a wind velocity that is the sum of the helicopter forward speed and rotor rotational speed. This value cannot exceed the speed of sound if the rotor is to be efficient and quiet. Slowing the rotor rotational speed avoids this problem, but presents another. In the traditional method of the composition of velocity it is easy to understand that the velocity experienced by the retreating blade has a value that is produced by the vector composition of the velocity of blade rotation and the freestream velocity. In this condition it is evident that in presence of a sufficiently high <b>advance</b> <b>ratio</b> the velocity of air on the retreating blade is low. The flapping movement of the blade changes the angle of attach. It is then possible for the blade to reach the stall condition. In this case it is necessary that the stalling blade increases the pitch angle to keep some lift capability. This risk puts constraints on the design of the system. An accurate choice of the wing profile is necessary and careful dimensioning of the radius of the rotor for the specified speed range. Slow speed cyclorotors bypass this problem through a horizontal axis of rotation and operating at a comparatively low blade tip speed. For higher speeds, which may become necessary for industrial applications, it seems necessary to adopt more sophisticated strategies and solutions. A solution is the independent actuation of the blades which have been recently patented and successfully tested for naval use [...] by use on hydraulic actuation system. In the aeronautic domain similar solutions appear difficult, because of the necessity of maintaining a low ratio between weight and thrust. One solution has been proposed by the Austrian inventor Meinhard Schwaiger with his turbomachine patent. The horizontal axis of rotation always provides an advancement of the upper blades, that produce always a positive lift by the full rotor. These characteristics could help overcome two issues of helicopters: their low energy efficiency and the <b>advance</b> <b>ratio</b> limitation.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} lifting-line, {{comprehensive approach to}} predicting the performance and loads of high <b>advance</b> <b>ratio</b> rotorcraft. At high advance ratios, the reverse flow region is large and its unique aerodynamics impacts the rotor performance and dynamics more than at conventional airspeeds where they are often ignored. The analysis is refined and augmented with improved modeling of the nearwake in reverse flow, a new aerodynamic model of the fuselage and the root cutout region and corrections to the airfoil properties for highly yawed flow. The analysis is correlated and evaluated against a full-scale UH- 60 A rotor test to an <b>advance</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. 0 and against an in-house Mach-scaled rotor to an <b>advance</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. 2. High <b>advance</b> <b>ratio</b> performance is predicted satisfactorily for both tests, including predicting the onset of thrust reversal. Despite the high <b>advance</b> <b>ratio,</b> correctly modeling the wake is most important for predicting airloads and the resulting blade bending loads, while yawed flow, nearwake inflow and the fuselage flow disturbances are important for predicting high <b>advance</b> <b>ratio</b> thrust and power.
