5|$|Alexander Rossi {{became the}} first American to drive in the United States Grand Prix at the Circuit of the Americas, {{returning}} to Manor Marussia after Roberto Merhi had raced for them in Russia. The Sauber team celebrated their 400th Grand Prix in Formula One. The weather was forecast to be wet <b>all</b> <b>weekend,</b> with especially treacherous conditions on Friday afternoon and Saturday, while the race day itself {{was expected to be}} slightly less wet.|$|E
5|$|During Copeland's training, {{he trained}} one weekday and <b>all</b> <b>weekend.</b> The school's {{practice}} ring was a 12-by-14-foot boxing ring with a harder mat {{than that of}} a typical wrestling ring. The ceiling above it was low, with exposed pipes, preventing top-rope moves from being performed. Copeland later credited this environment with forcing him to drill and improve his technical mat-based wrestling. His classmates included Johnny Swinger, Joe E. Legend, and Rob Etcheverria (who later became notable for training wrestlers such as Gail Kim, Angelina Love, and Taylor Wilde).|$|E
5|$|After {{the very}} warm {{practice}} sessions, qualifying on Saturday was run under difficult weather conditions. Qualifying one (Q1) {{started on a}} damp track and therefore on intermediate tyres, while by Q2 the track was almost dry and slick tyres were used. In Q1 Romain Grosjean collided with the slower running HRT of Pedro de la Rosa and lost his front wing. While he succeeded in nursing the car back into the pit lane, {{he was unable to}} change his tyres and was therefore left in a disappointing 18th position on the grid. Michael Schumacher's last ever qualifying did not go well either. He took 14th position, almost half a second down on his teammate, admitting he had perhaps compromised his setup too much for an expected wet race. The McLarens were fastest <b>all</b> <b>weekend</b> and easily took the front row, with Lewis Hamilton securing his last pole position with the team. Title contenders Vettel and Alonso both struggled, taking 4th and 8th position on the grid respectively. Pastor Maldonado was handed a 10-place grid penalty for missing the weighbridge {{in the second part of}} qualifying. He dropped from sixth to 16th, moving Alonso one place up to seventh.|$|E

5|$|Metrorail begins {{service at}} 5 am Monday through Friday, 7 am on Saturdays, and 8 am Sundays; it ends service at 11:30 pm Monday through Thursday, 1:00 am Friday and Saturday, and 11:00 pm on Sundays, {{although}} the last trains leave the end stations inbound {{about half an}} hour before these times. Trains run more frequently during rush hours on all lines, with scheduled peak hour headways of 4 minutes on the Red Line and 9 minutes on all other lines. Headways are much longer during midday and evening on weekdays and <b>all</b> <b>weekend.</b> The midday six-minute headways are based on a combination of two Metrorail lines (Orange/Blue and Yellow/Green) as each route can run every 12 minutes; {{in the case of the}} Red Line, every other train bound for Glenmont terminates at Silver Spring instead. Night and weekend service varies between 8 and 24 minutes, with trains generally scheduled only every 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Mercedes confirmed their good form from pre-season testing and topped the time sheets by a considerable margin {{in the first}} two practice sessions on Friday, with Nico Rosberg fastest in both outings. Valtteri Bottas in the Williams was third fastest on Friday morning, some 1.2 seconds down on Rosberg's time. Ferrari's new signing Sebastian Vettel was third on Friday afternoon, seven-tenths of a second down on Rosberg. Toro Rosso showed promising times, outperforming their sister team Red Bull in the first session. Only 16 cars participated on Friday morning. Sauber kept to the garage due to their legal troubles while Manor Marussia was unable to get their cars running <b>all</b> <b>weekend.</b> The Saubers did go out for the second session, while local favourite Daniel Ricciardo and Felipe Massa missed the session due to problems with their cars. McLaren's problems continued as both cars were limited to very few laps. The first session also saw another evaluation run of the new Virtual Safety Car system.|$|E
5|$|The second {{qualifying}} period was fifteen minutes in length, {{and was used}} to set positions eleven through to sixteen. It was once again topped by Nico Rosberg, {{who was the first}} person to set a time under 1:43.000 <b>all</b> <b>weekend.</b> Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton locked his brakes on the approach to turn 7, damaging his race tyres. Hamilton narrowly avoided elimination, setting a time good enough to proceed on his last attempt. Romain Grosjean was eliminated in eleventh, having overcome issues with his brake balance. Nico Hülkenberg was a surprise elimination in twelfth, having run consistently at the front of the field throughout the weekend. His elimination was attributed to a miscommunication between himself and his engineer over the amount of fuel he had on board. Carlos Sainz Jr. and Fernando Alonso finished thirteenth and fourteenth to fill the seventh row of the grid, ahead of Gutiérrez.|$|E

25|$|Double world {{champion}} Alain Prost's McLaren {{had been having}} problems <b>all</b> <b>weekend</b> with the Frenchman finding the McLaren MP4/5 hard to set up, and when his two stop strategy was ruined by a clutch failure, {{he knew he had}} to continue the race having made just one of his scheduled two pit stops on the notoriously abrasive Rio circuit. He finished second. Nigel Mansell secured a surprising win for the Scuderia, with no problems despite ongoing gearbox faults <b>all</b> <b>weekend</b> and a lack of winter testing (Mansell also had the steering wheel come loose on the back straight and had to have it changed in his final stop, which luckily was scheduled for the end of that lap). The final step of the podium was taken by local Maurício Gugelmin. Grand Prix debutant Johnny Herbert, Derek Warwick and Alessandro Nannini scored the remaining points. Warwick was desperately unlucky. He lost over 20 seconds in a slow pit stop and only finished 17.8 seconds behind Mansell at the finish suggesting a win (which would have been both his and Arrows' first) or podium place had gone begging.|$|E
25|$|The Husker's went on {{to sweep}} the Texas Longhorn's that weekend, {{due in part to}} the {{dominant}} pitching that happened <b>all</b> <b>weekend.</b> The Husker pitching staff allowed just 3 runs in 33 innings of work (1 run Friday, 0 runs Saturday and 2 runs Sunday). During this 33 inning stretch, the Husker pitching staff also recorded 33 strikeouts with just 5 walks. This was the most strikeouts in a single weekend for Coach Erstad since he took over in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{speed of}} the Castrol Commodore {{surprised}} many as Perkins chose to run a Holden V8 engine rather than the more powerful Chevrolet V8 used by the other leading Holden teams (Brock, Gibson Motorsport and HRT). Perkins claimed using the Holden engine was purely down to cost against the more expensive Chev as he had many of the well developed Holden's at his team base. He also claimed to get better fuel consumption from the Holden, and with only a small difference in power and a superior set up, {{he was able to}} run ahead of all but the Richards/Skaife Winfield Commodore <b>all</b> <b>weekend.</b>|$|E

25|$|Despite {{heavy rain}} early Friday morning, the track was dry {{for the first}} {{practice}} and remained that way <b>all</b> <b>weekend.</b> On his first lap, Barrichello became the first Formula 1 driver in three years of running at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to hit the concrete wall in the oval section of the track. As {{he was about to}} finish his first lap, his left rear tire lost pressure and the car was flung into the outer wall {{at the top of the}} main straight, ripping off the left rear corner and front wing. Barrichello's car missed the energy-absorbing Steel And Foam Energy Reduction (SAFER) barrier that had been installed in front of the concrete wall in all of the oval turns the previous May. The Ferrari went across the grass at the bottom of Turn 13, up the banking, and hit the bare concrete wall at the beginning of the straight.|$|E

25|$|At Silverstone, {{which he}} said he {{considers}} to be his second home, he qualified 16th, outpacing Button. With heavy rain on race day, through good use of an extreme wet tyre he finished 3rd, achieving his first podium since 2005. However, in Germany, a collision with David Coulthard ended his hopes for points. In Hungary, he was lapped by the leader, repeating the same performance in Valencia. In Belgium he qualified 16th but had to retire because of a gearbox fault. At a wet Monza, he was second fastest in Friday practice and started from 16th on the grid. He managed {{to get up to}} 9th but as a result of using the wrong type of tyre in his second pit stop he ended up 17th. At the first ever night race in Singapore he was in a good position to score some points after pitting before the pit lane closed for the safety car period, but shortly afterwards the engine failed and he had to retire. In Japan he started from 17th on the grid, but managed to get up to 13th {{by the end of the}} race. In China he managed to get into Q2 for the first time in ten races, and would have started 14th. But after Mark Webber had his ten place penalty for an engine change added he was moved up to 13th. On race day he had a good start, and got up to 10th early on and held a strong mid table position all race and finished 11th, five places ahead of Button, who had struggled <b>all</b> <b>weekend.</b>|$|E
