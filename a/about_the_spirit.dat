25|$|While {{the gospel}} of Luke is {{explicit}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> of God descending {{in the shape of}} a dove, the wording of Matthew is vague enough that it could be interpreted only to suggest that the descent was in the style of a dove. Although a variety of symbolisms were attached to doves at the time these passages were written, the dove imagery has become a well known symbol for the Holy Spirit in Christian art. Depictions of the baptismal scene typical show the sky opening and the Holy Spirit descending as a dove towards Jesus.|$|E
25|$|No Man's Sky {{represented}} Hello Games' {{vision of}} a broad, attention-getting game {{that they wanted to}} pursue while they secured their financial well being through the Joe Danger series of games. The game's original prototype was worked on by Hello Games' Sean Murray who wanted to create a game <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of exploration inspired by the optimistic science fiction of Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke and Robert Heinlein and the cover artwork of these works in the 1970s and 1980s. Development expanded into a small four-person team prior to its first teaser in December 2013. About a dozen developers worked on the game in the three years leading up to its release, with Sony Interactive Entertainment providing promotional and marketing support. Sony formally announced the title during their press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014, the first independently-developed game to be presented at the Expo's centrepiece events.|$|E

500|$|Late 20th {{century and}} early 21st century critics {{continued}} the religious emphasis. Craig Raine pointed out: [...] "Undeniably, Four Quartets has its faults—for instance, the elementary tautology of 'anxious worried women' in section I of The Dry Salvages. But the passages documenting in undeniable detail 'the moment {{in and out}} of time' are the most successful attempts at the mystical in poetry since Wordsworth's spots of time in The Prelude—themselves a refiguration of the mystical." [...] Michael Bell argued for the universality within the poems' religious dimension and claimed that the poems [...] "were genuinely of their time in that, while speaking of religious faith, they did not assume it in the reader." [...] John Cooper, in regard to the poem's place within the historical context of World War II, described the aspects of the series appeal: [...] "Four Quartets spoke <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> {{in the midst of this}} new crisis and, not surprisingly, there were many readers who would not only allow the poem to carry them with it, but who also hungered for it." ...|$|E

[...] Moore writes in Beware of the Dog: Rugby's Hard Man Reveals All that, ‘I have no issue with what Campese did; I would have done the same, and he got away with it.

2500|$|John's gospel is {{the only}} {{canonical}} one that gives Thomas the Apostle a dramatic role and spoken part, and Thomas {{is the only}} character therein described as having apistos (unbelief), despite the failings of virtually all the Johannine characters {{to live up to}} the author's standards of belief. With respect to the famous story of [...] "Doubting Thomas", it is suggested that John may have been denigrating or ridiculing a rival school of thought. In another apparent contrast, John's text matter-of-factly presents a bodily resurrection as if this is a sine qua non of the faith; in contrast, Thomas' insights about the spirit-and-body are more nuanced. For Thomas, resurrection seems more a cognitive event of spiritual attainment, one even involving a certain discipline or asceticism. Again, an apparently denigrating portrayal in the [...] "Doubting Thomas" [...] story may either be taken literally, or as a kind of mock [...] "comeback" [...] to Thomas' logia: not as an outright censuring of Thomas, but an improving gloss. After all, Thomas' thoughts <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> and body are really not so different from those which John has presented elsewhere. John portrays Thomas as physically touching the risen Jesus, inserting fingers and hands into his body, and ending with a shout. Pagels interprets this as signifying one-upmanship by John, who is forcing Thomas to acknowledge Jesus' bodily nature. She writes that [...] "...he shows Thomas giving up his search for experiential truth – his 'unbelief' – to confess what John sees as the truth...". The point of these examples, as used by Riley and Pagels, is to support the argument that the text of Thomas must have existed and have gained a following at the time of the writing of John's Gospel, and that the importance of the Thomasine logia was great enough that John felt the necessity of weaving them into his own narrative.|$|E
