Population assessments for long-lived, wide-ranging species such as sea turtles may need to include a spatial component and {{a consideration of the}} affected life stages. We used a spatial matrix population projection model to examine the impact of federally authorized incidental fishing mortality on a simulated Northwest Atlantic loggerhead sea turtle population. We projected the population for 100 years, simulating fisheries bycatch mortality through removals from the population that were directed toward specific spatial units or life stages. We kept removals constant across years for most simulations. We incorporated demographic information in the removals by using reproductive values to estimate adult-equivalent turtles, which we compared with removing individual turtles. Removals made in terms of <b>adult</b> <b>equivalents</b> had identical population impacts for all removal schemes (80 % population decline after 40 years). Removals made in terms of individuals had the greatest impact if weighted toward the adult life stage (89 % population decline after 40 years) and the least impact if weighted toward the youngest life stage (78 % population decline after 40 years). Differences in impact between spatially directed removals were attributed to unequal stage distributions between regions. Because the population impact of loggerhead mortality depends on the affected life stage, the monitoring of population-level impacts is more reliable if authorized incidental take is specified and monitored by life stage or by <b>adult</b> <b>equivalents...</b>|$|R

Improving the reproductive performance of cows {{has been identified as}} a key target for increasing profitability, and this higher efficiency is also likely to reduce the GHG emissions intensity of beef production. The effects of strategies to increase the fertility of breeding herds and earlier joining of heifers as yearlings were studied on two properties at Longreach and Boulia in western Queensland. The beef production, GHG emissions, emissions intensity and profitability were investigated and compared with typical management in the two regions. Overall weaning rates achieved on the two properties were 79 % and 74 % compared with typical herd weaning rates of 58 % in both regions. Herds with high reproductive performance had GHG emissions intensities (t CO 2 -e t– 1 liveweight sold) 28 % and 22 % lower than the typical herds at Longreach and Boulia, with most of the benefit from higher weaning rates.

Second, most of the ads place the camera at eye-level—a framing that allows the child models to address their adult viewers as equals. Finally, almost half of the ads feature at least one child looking directly at the camera with a serious expression. This is significant because, in Western culture, the withholding of a smile is a sign of dominance typically reserved for adult males. When children mimic this familiar and powerful “look,” they convey a sense of adult-like confidence and self-awareness often associated with precocious sexuality...|$|R
