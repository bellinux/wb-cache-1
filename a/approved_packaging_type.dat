At all these stages of this [...] "life cycle", the package must have approvals from the appropriate users or user groups. These approvals are recorded permanently for audit purposes.

50|$|Quadracs are {{available}} {{in a variety of}} integrated circuit (IC) <b>package</b> <b>types</b> with different numbers of pins. Basic IC <b>packages</b> <b>types</b> for quadracs include discrete packaging (DPAK), power packaging (PPAK), and in-line packaging (IPAK).

Quadracs that use metal electrode leadless face (MELF) packaging have metallized terminals at each end of a cylindrical body. Other available <b>package</b> <b>types</b> for quadracs include thin small outline package (TSOP), thin shrink small outline L-leaded package (TSSOP), and thin small outline J-lead (TSOJ) package.|$|R

30|$|Chinese {{consumers}} {{are willing to}} pay a small premium for pistachio with original, no-salt and no-sugar flavor. The average WTP is 2.02 Chinese Yuan ($ 0.3) to move from sweet pistachios to an original product. The WTP estimate is not statistically significant for the Original to Salty variable, meaning Chinese consumers do not prefer original flavor to salty flavor. Combining this result with results in Table 7, we conclude that original or salty flavor is more attractive than the sweet flavor. WTP estimates are not significant for the <b>package</b> <b>type</b> and <b>package</b> size variables, indicating that respondents' WTP will not change with <b>package</b> <b>type</b> and <b>package</b> size. The WTP estimates are the greatest for the COO attributes, followed by the original flavor attributes. In addition, respondents will not pay a premium for preferred <b>package</b> <b>type</b> or <b>package</b> size. This result agrees with the relative importance estimates in Table 6. The WTP estimate for <b>package</b> <b>type</b> in Table 8 is insignificant, but the coefficient estimate for <b>package</b> <b>type</b> is significant in Table 5. This seems to suggest that respondents consider <b>package</b> <b>type</b> when purchasing pistachio, however, they will not pay a premium for pistachios that have a preferred <b>package</b> <b>type.</b>|$|R
