This paper presents a number of case studies that focussed on the sources of variation in meat quality, but in particular on sources of changes in meat tenderness over the past two decades. These sources include feeding regime, the use of beta agonists, post mortem ageing and electrical stimulation. In some studies these factors are integrated with age or interactions among two or more of these factors are investigated. [URL]...|$|R

In MALES, MUSCLING and PROVENANCE affected DRESSING (P< 0. 05), 1. 4 % in favor of cattle with thicker MUSCLING, and 1. 6 % in favor of cattle originated from the Andean region versus their Mid-Western region counterparts. Sex class (in MIXED), and PROVENANCE (in MALES), affected both BW and CW (P< 0. 01). In MIXED, an age exceeding 36 months, raised the CW (P< 0. 05). In MALES, MUSCLING was associated (P< 0. 01) with carcass conformation (r= 0. 53) and DRESSING (r= 0. 18).

40|$|Objectives To (1) define {{mechanical}} properties in flexion, extension, and left lateral bending of cadaveric equine 4 th and 5 th cervical (C 4 -C 5) articulations, (2) compare bio{{mechanical properties}} of C 4 -C 5 when stabilized with a kerf cut cylinder (KCC) {{compared with a}} ventrally placed 4. 5 mm locking compression plate (LCP). Study Design In vitro biomechanical investigation. Sample Population Cadaveric adult equine cervical vertebral columns (n= 54). Methods Cervical vertebrae <b>aged</b> <b>by</b> horse <b>dentition</b> and size measured from radiographs were divided into 3 age groups then randomly allocated to 3 groups. The C 4 -C 5 articulation was treated differently {{in each of the}} groups: KCC group; KCC-implanted LCP group; 8 -hole 4. 5 mm LCP implanted and intact group; no implant. Specimens were randomly subdivided into 1 of 3 loading conditions, before testing to failure under 4 -point bending. Stiffness, yield bending moment, failure bending moment, and failure mode were recorded. General linear models were performed to analyze associations between biomechanical properties and test variables. Results All specimens failed at the C 4 -C 5 intervertebral articulation. The cervical vertebrae with the LCP construct had significantly higher stiffness, yield bending moment, and failure bending moment than the KCC-implanted cervical vertebrae. Failure modes differed between groups and varied with loading direction: KCC group, fractures of C 5 associated with the KCC were common; LCP group, screw pull out or fractures (of C 4 and C 5 bodies, during extension and the caudal aspect of C 4 during left lateral bending) were common; and intact group, subluxations were most common.

40|$|Objectives: Bottled water {{consumption}} in the United States has greatly increased in the past decade. Because the majority of commercial bottled water is low in fluoride, there {{is the potential for}} an increase in dental caries. In these sec-ondary data analyses, associations between bottled water use and dental caries were explored. Methods: Subjects (n = 413) are in the Iowa Fluoride Study, which included dental examinations of the primary (approximately aged 5) and early erupt-ing permanent (approximately <b>aged</b> 9) <b>dentitions</b> <b>by</b> trained dentist examiners. Per-manent tooth caries and primary second molar increments were related to bottled water use using logistic and negative binomial regression models. All models were adjusted for age and the frequency of toothbrushing. Results: Bottled water use in this cohort was fairly limited (~ 10 percent). While bottled water users had signifi-cantly lower fluoride intakes, especially fluoride from water, there were no signifi-cant differences found in either permanent tooth caries (P = 0. 20 and 0. 91 for prevalence and D 2 +FS, respectively) or primary second molar caries (P = 0. 94 an...|$|R

40|$|Assessment of {{the small}} {{ruminants}} production systems was conducted in four selected representative rural kebeles, namely, Woheni Durebetie, Woyenema Ambaye, Denbun and Boko Tabo in Burie Woreda to assess the farmers’ traditional small ruminants management practices, to identify and prioritize the constraints {{of the small}} ruminants production systems. The study was carried out through informal and formal surveys in the selected kebeles. The farmers interviewed in the informal survey were selected purposively and for the formal survey, by systematic random sampling method. In addition, sheep/ goat flocks in the grazing fields were selected randomly and body weight (BW) (using hanging scale), sex and <b>age</b> (<b>by</b> <b>dentition)</b> of the animals were measured and recorded. Farmers in the study area rear sheep for two main purposes, for cash income and home slaughter on festivals. On average, one household had 3. 7 ± 2. 46 heads of sheep (n = 127). There were two sheep breeds in the study kebeles, Washera and Horro. The mean body weight of sheep in the flock was 21. 6 ± 9. 34 kg (n = 1211). From the current survey result, it was evident that there were more Washera sheep (98 %) in Woheni Durebetie Kebele and more Horro sheep (92 %) in Boko Tabo Kebele in Burie Woreda. As farmers in the study area sell, castrate and slaughter males at a very young age, there is a possibility of inbreeding in the sheep flocks. The main feed resources for sheep in the area are natural pasture and stubble grazing. In addition, most farmers supplement salt and atella (a local beer (tela) residue) to their animals. There is feed shortage problem both during the dry and rainy seasons in the highland kebeles. Based on calculation of feed requirement for the existing livestock per household, there is a deficit of 0. 7 ton DM feed per household per year in the highland kebeles. One household in the area sold on average 1. 1 ± 1. 40 heads of sheep (n = 127) per year. Farmers mainly sell sheep during Easter, New Year and Christmas. Sheep from the woreda and neighbouring woredas and even neighbouring region enters into the woreda for marketing. Among the constraints identified in sheep production, sheep diseases, lack of adequate veterinary service and feed and nutrient shortage are the main ones. To bring improvements in sheep production in Burie Woreda, these constraints should be given more emphasis in research and development activities {{that are going to be}} undertaken in the area. The goat production system in the study area is similar in several respects to the sheep production system. Two on-farm feeding trials were conducted in Arebesi, Tiya Tiya and Sertekez kebeles in Burie Woreda. The objectives of the trials were to evaluate the weight change performance of the lambs when they were fed urea treated wheat straw and concentrates, to estimate the economic feasibility and to assess farmers evaluation of these feeding practices. The lambs used in the trial were all local breeds (Washera, Horro and crossbreds) and of male sex. The animals used in the grazing and wheat straw feeding trial had an initial body weight of 20. 8 ± 3. 88 kg (n = 18) and 23. 3 ± 4. 37 kg (n = 32) and an initial age of 8. 7 ± 1. 68 months (n = 18) and 10. 2 ± 1. 84 months (n = 32), respectively. The wheat straw that was used for the trial was treated with 5 % urea. The following treatments were used in the trials. In the grazing trial, farmers’ traditional fattening practices and grazing plus 200 g concentrate mix supplement. In the wheat straw feeding trial, untreated wheat straw plus 200 g concentrate mix and urea treated wheat straw plus 200 g concentrate mix supplement. The concentrate mix consisted of 75 % groundnut cake (150 g) and 25 % wheat bran (50 g). A completely randomized design was employed for the on-farm feeding trials. At the end of the feeding trials, farmers’ were interviewed individually and in a group to evaluate the results of the feeding trials. Economic analysis was done using partial budget analysis. The trials were conducted for 86 days. The experimental animals consumed almost all the concentrate feed mix offered to them during the trials. The animals’ consumption of urea treated and untreated wheat straw was very low, 52. 8 g and 7. 4 g per day, respectively. There was no difference (P> 0. 05) on final BW and daily BW gain between the treatments in the wheat straw feeding trial. But, in the grazing trial, there was a difference (P< 0. 05) on final BW and daily BW gain between the treatments. The animals in the concentrate supplemented treatment and the control group had a mean final BW of 24. 6 kg and 21. 9 kg and a mean daily BW gain of 43. 6 g and 12. 9 g per day, respectively. Supplementation of groundnut cake and wheat bran mix to grazing sheep was feasible based on partial budget analysis also. Furthermore, this treatment was selected to be the best by farmers’ evaluation and has a potential for adoption by farmers. Hence, this feeding practice can be scaled up to be widely used in the study area. Canadian International Development Agenc...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the development of a rapidly repeating movement of the whole body from ground reaction forces exerted during a side jump. Subjects were 246 healthy females aged 5 - 17 years, and their physique(body height, body mass, skinfold thickness), muscular power(vertical jump, standing broad jump) and rapidly repeating movement(side jump) were measured. The procedure of the side jump were hopping between two parallel lines on the force plate from right to left alternately as quickly as possible. The distance between the lines was fixed at one third of the mean body height at each age. Force curves gained by using force plate were calculated using the jumping frequency per 1 second(the frequency calculated from the time required for one jump), the times on the ground and in the air, the maximum vertical and horizontal forces, the vertical and horizontal impulses and the kicking angle calculated from maximum vertical and horizontal forces. The ferquency of the side jump per 1 second increased significantly with <b>age</b> <b>by</b> 9 years and decreased gradually with <b>age</b> <b>by</b> 17 years. The time on the ground and the time in the air shortened significantly with <b>age</b> <b>by</b> 9 years and prolonged gradually with <b>age</b> <b>by</b> 17 years. The maximum vertical force per unit body mass didn't change remarkably with age, but the maximum horizontal force per unit body mass increased significantly with <b>age</b> <b>by</b> 13 years and decreased gradually with <b>age</b> <b>by</b> 17 years. The kicking angle decreased significantly with <b>age</b> <b>by</b> 13 years and increased gradually with <b>age</b> <b>by</b> 17 years. The vertical impulse per unit body mass decreased significantly with <b>age</b> <b>by</b> 9 years, but the horizontal impulse per unit body mass didn't change remarkably with age.

40|$|Mean age of air (AoA) is {{a widely}} used metric to {{describe}} the transport along the Brewer–Dobson circulation. We seek to untangle the effects of different processes on the simulation of AoA, using the chemistry–climate model EMAC (ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry) and the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS). Here, the effects of residual transport and two-way mixing on AoA are calculated. To do so, we calculate the residual circulation transit time (RCTT). The difference of AoA and RCTT is defined as <b>aging</b> <b>by</b> mixing. However, as diffusion is also included in this difference, we further use a method to directly calculate <b>aging</b> <b>by</b> mixing on resolved scales. Comparing these two methods of calculating <b>aging</b> <b>by</b> mixing allows for separating the effect of unresolved <b>aging</b> <b>by</b> mixing (which we term "aging by diffusion" in the following) in EMAC and CLaMS. We find that diffusion impacts AoA by making air older, but its contribution plays a minor role (order of 10  %) in all simulations. However, due to the different advection schemes of the two models, <b>aging</b> <b>by</b> diffusion has a larger effect on AoA and mixing efficiency in EMAC, compared to CLaMS. Regarding the trends in AoA, in CLaMS the AoA trend is negative throughout the stratosphere except in the Northern Hemisphere middle stratosphere, consistent with observations. This slight positive trend is neither reproduced in a free-running nor in a nudged simulation with EMAC – in both simulations the AoA trend is negative throughout the stratosphere.
