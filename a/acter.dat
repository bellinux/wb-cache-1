40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{study of the}} nature of the lowest empty conduction-band states in crystalline polyethylene (PE), conducted through density-functional electronic structure calculations. Results reveal that the wave function of the conduction-band edge is of interchain character, as opposed to the intrachain char- <b>acter</b> of all the filled valence-band states. Thus, while a hole added to neutral PE will mainly belong to the PE chain backbone bonds, an added electron in PE will mostly reside between the chains, and far from the existing bonds. Moreover, the added electron state charge centroid is predicted to move further out from the chain backbone towards the low-density interstitial region, if and when the chains are pried apart. This suggests that injected electrons will naturally flow to low-density regions inside real PE, and that the experimentally estab- lished propensity of PE to expel electrons out of the bulk, should be directly related to the interchain nature of the conduction states...|$|E

Results: Those assigned to healthy work-related behavior and experience patterns diVered in their strengths proWles from those that demonstrated unhealthy patterns (i. e., burn- out type) in a predictable way.

40|$|Integral {{constraints}} for {{momentum and}} energy impose restrictions on parameterizations of eddy potential vorticity (PV) fluxes. The {{impact of these}} constraints is studied for a wind forced quasigeostrophic two-layer zonal channel model with variable bottom topography. The presence of a small parameter, given by the ratio of Rossby radius to {{the width of the}} channel, allows us to find an analytical/asymptotic solution for the zonally and time averaged flow, given diffusive parameterizations for the eddy PV fluxes. This solution, when substituted in the constraints, leads to non-trivial explicit restrictions on diffusivities. The system is characterized by four dimensionless governing parameters with a clear physical interpretation. The bottom form stress, the major term balancing the external force of wind stress, depends on the governing parameters and fundamentally modifies the restrictions compared to the flat-bottom case. While the analytical solution bears an illustrative char- <b>acter,</b> it helps to see certain non-trivial connections in the system which will be useful in the analysis of more complicated models of ocean circulation. A numerical solution supports the analytical study and confirms that the presence of topography strongly modifies the eddy fluxes...|$|E
