Here, {{we show that}} the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf) is highly expressed in naive B cells, where it antagonizes the process of terminal differentiation through the repression of IRF- 4. Defective Mitf activity results in spontaneous B cell activation, antibody secretion, and autoantibody production. Conversely, ectopic Mitf expression suppresses the expression of IRF- 4, the plasma cell marker CD 138, and antibody secretion. Thus, Mitf regulates B cell homeostasis by suppressing the antibody-secreting fate. Key words: autoimmunity • antibody secretion • cellular differentiation • immunoglobulin • IRF-...|$|E

MyD 88 knockout C 57 BL/ 6 mice (MyD 88 −/− mice) vaccinated with influenza VLPs showed significant defects in inducing IgG 2 a/c isotype antibodies and in generating splenic recall memory B <b>cell</b> responses and <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> in the bone marrow. The protective efficacy of influenza VLP vaccination was lower in MyD 88 −/− mice than in the wild-type mice.

In particular, the results in this study demonstrated {{for the first time}} that MyD 88 -mediated immune activation is likely an essential pathway for effective generation of long-lived <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> and highly protective immunity after vaccination with influenza VLPs.

Blimp- 1 -independent differentiation was blocked at a preplasmablast stage characterized by decreased Pax 5 expression and the activation of plasma-cell genes. Analysis of Blimp- 1 -sufficient differentiation revealed a phase prior to Blimp- 1 expression in which several genes normally repressed by Pax 5 are re-expressed, suggesting that plasma-cell differentiation is initiated by the inhibition of Pax 5 function.

Herein, we discovered a novel and important mechanism whereby non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) blunt human B-cell antibody production. We demonstrate that the Cox- 2 selective small molecule inhibitors SC- 58125 and NS- 398 attenuate the production of human antibody isotypes including immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG 1, IgG 2, IgG 3 and IgG 4. In addition, inhibition of Cox- 2 significantly reduced the generation of CD 38 + IgM+ and CD 38 + IgG+ antibody-secreting cells.

Most importantly, the expression of XBP- 1 and activated PKD was sufficient to induce lytic viral gene expression in EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells and lymphoblastoid cells, while an XBP- 1 small interfering RNA inhibited constitutive lytic EBV gene expression in lymphoblastoid cells.

The results show that while the global thiol-disulfide state is affected to some extent by the differentiation, steady-state levels of glutathionylated protein thiols are less than 0. 3 % of the total protein cysteines, even in fully differentiated cells, and the overall protein redox state is not affected until late in differentiation, when large-scale IgM production is ongoing. A general expansion of the ER does not affect global protein redox status until an extensive production of cargo proteins has started. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{cornerstone}} of humoral immunity is the differentiation of B <b>cells</b> into <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> This process is tightly {{controlled by a}} regulatory gene network centered on the transcriptional repressor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp 1). Proliferation of activated B cells is required to foster Blimp 1 expression but needs to be terminated to avoid overshooting immune reactions. Activator protein 1 (AP- 1) transcription factors become quickly up-regulated upon B cell activation. We demonstrate that Fra 1, a Fos member of AP- 1, enhances activation-induced cell death upon induction in activated B cells. Moreover, mice with B cell-specific deletion of Fra 1 show enhanced <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation and exacerbated antibody responses. In contrast, transgenic overexpression of Fra 1 blocks <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation and immunoglobulin production, which cannot be rescued by Bcl 2. On the molecular level, Fra 1 represses Blimp 1 expression and interferes with binding of the activating AP- 1 member c-Fos to the Blimp 1 promoter. Conversely, overexpression of c-Fos in Fra 1 transgenic B cells releases Blimp 1 repression. As Fra 1 lacks transcriptional transactivation domains, we propose that Fra 1 inhibits Blimp 1 expression and negatively controls <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation through binding to the Blimp 1 promoter. In summary, we demonstrate that Fra 1 negatively controls <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation by repressing Blimp 1 expression...|$|R
40|$|The {{adaptive}} unfolded protein response (UPR) {{is essential}} for the development of <b>antibody-secreting</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>cells.</b> B cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to differentiate into <b>plasma</b> <b>cells</b> exhibit a nonclassical UPR that has been reported to anticipate endoplasmic reticulum stress prior to immunoglobulin production. Here I demonstrate that activation of a physiologic UPR is not limited to cells undergoing secretory cell differentiation. I identify B cell receptor (BCR) signaling as an unexpected physiologic UPR trigger and demonstrate that in mature B cells, BCR stimulation induces a short-lived UPR similar to the LPS-triggered nonclassical UPR. However, unlike LPS, BCR stimulation does not induce <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. Furthermore, the BCR-induced UPR is not limited to cells in which BCR is an activating signal, as a UPR is also induced in transitional immature B cells, which respond to BCR stimulation with a rapid apoptotic fate. This response involves sustained upregulation of Chop mRNA indicative of a terminal UPR. While sustained Chop expression correlates with the ultimate fate of the BCR-triggered B cell and not its developmental stage, Chop−/− B cells undergo apoptosis, indicating that CHOP is not required for this process. The studies presented establish a system whereby a terminal or adaptive UPR can be alternatively triggered by physiologic stimuli. ...|$|R
