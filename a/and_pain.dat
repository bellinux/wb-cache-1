5|$|Pain {{was born}} {{some time before}} 1100. His father {{may have been in}} the service of King Henry in Normandy before Henry became king.

5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, may {{contribute}} to clogged milk ducts in lactating women. Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, they do not easily accommodate changes in breast size, and an ill-fitting bra that {{does not support the}} breasts correctly can cause discomfort <b>and</b> <b>pain.</b> For several days after a mastectomy, or as long as the breast is tender, a woman is advised not to use an underwire bra.|$|E
5|$|All {{medical records}} and documents, {{including}} Poe's death certificate, have been lost, {{if they ever}} existed. The precise cause of Poe's death is disputed, but many theories exist. Many biographers have addressed the issue and reached different conclusions, ranging from Jeffrey Meyers' assertion that it was hypoglycemia to John Evangelist Walsh's conspiratorial murder plot theory. It has also been suggested that Poe's death might have resulted from suicide related to depression. In 1848, he nearly died from an overdose of laudanum, readily available as a tranquilizer <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> killer. Though it is unclear {{if this was a}} true suicide attempt or just a miscalculation on Poe's part, it did not lead to Poe's death a year later.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin is a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} the fever and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. Naproxen {{has been shown to}} be as effective as aspirin and less toxic, but due to the limited clinical experience, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment.|$|E

5|$|Burns {{that affect}} only the {{superficial}} skin layers {{are known as}} superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends {{into some of the}} underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.|$|E
5|$|CSF can {{be tested}} for the {{diagnosis}} {{of a variety of}} neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested. About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture, <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.|$|E

5|$|Cancer {{changes over}} time, <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> {{management}} needs to reflect this. Several {{different types of}} treatment may be required as the disease progresses. Pain managers should clearly explain to the patient {{the cause of the}} pain and the various treatment possibilities, and should consider, as well as drug therapy, directly modifying the underlying disease, raising the pain threshold, interrupting, destroying or stimulating pain pathways, and suggesting lifestyle modification. The relief of psychological, social and spiritual distress is a key element in effective pain management.|$|E
5|$|From the history, {{indicators}} of pulpal, periodontal, {{a combination of}} both, or non-dental causes can be observed. Periodontal pain is frequently localized to a particular tooth, which is made much worse by biting on the tooth, sudden in onset, and associated with bleeding <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> when brushing. More than one factor {{may be involved in}} the toothache. For example, a pulpal abscess (which is typically severe, spontaneous and localized) can cause periapical periodontitis (which results in pain on biting). Cracked tooth syndrome may also cause a combination of symptoms. Lateral periodontitis (which is usually without any thermal sensitivity and sensitive to biting) can cause pulpitis and the tooth becomes sensitive to cold.|$|E
5|$|His {{eyes are}} open, {{and his skin}} is unblemished. The cross is painted with deep blue paint, perhaps evoking an eternal or {{timeless}} sky. This evocation, not present in the main crucified figure, {{was known as the}} Christus triumphans ("Triumphant Christ"), and for contemporaryâ especially Franciscanâ taste lacked verisimilitude, as it bore little relation to the actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion, and overly distanced the divine from the human aspect of Christ. From about 1240, painters favoured the Christus patiens ("Suffering Christ") style: a saviour who shared the burden <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> of humanity. The Santa Croce Crucifix is one of the earliest and best known examples of the type.|$|E

5|$|In June 1911, Charlotte {{attended}} {{her cousin}} George V's coronation in England, but the country's summer heat left her bed-ridden with a swollen face <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> in her limbs. On 25 June 1914, her husband inherited his father's dukedom and became Bernhard III, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. World War I broke out on 28 July; Bernhard {{left for the}} front while Charlotte remained behind to oversee the duchy, serving mainly as a figurehead. During the war, Charlotte increasingly experienced various pains including chronic aches, swollen legs, and kidney problems. The degree of the pain became so severe that she took opium as her only comfortable treatment.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{responses}} of the immune system to infection. The symptoms of inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, <b>and</b> <b>pain,</b> which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue. Inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines, which are released by injured or infected cells. Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation, and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells (leukocytes). Common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells; chemokines that promote chemotaxis; and interferons that have anti-viral effects, such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell. Growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released. These cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy <b>and</b> <b>pain</b> relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
