25|$|Futurism is {{a modernist}} avant-garde {{movement}} {{in literature and}} part of the Futurism art movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century. It made its official literature debut with the publication of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism (1909). Futurist poetry is characterised by unexpected combinations of images and by its hyper-concision (in both economy of speech and <b>actual</b> <b>length).</b> Futurist theatre also played an important role within the movement and is distinguished by scenes that are only a few sentences long, an emphasis on nonsensical humour, and attempts to examine and subvert traditions of theatre via parody and other techniques. Longer forms of literature, such as the novel, have no place in the Futurist aesthetic of speed and compression. Futurist literature primarily focuses on seven aspects: intuition, analogy, irony, abolition of syntax, metrical reform, onomatopoeia, and essential/synthetic lyricism.|$|E

It {{is in fact the}} case that the figures on the river-bank are not in the commune of Asnières, but are rather in Courbevoie, the commune bordering Asnières to the west. The bathers themselves are in the River Seine. The slope forming most of the left hand side of the painting was known as the Côte des Ajoux, {{near the end of the}} rue des Ajoux, on the north bank of the river. Opposite is the island of la Grande Jatte, the east tip of which is shown as the slope and the trees to the right, and which Seurat has pictorially extended beyond its <b>actual</b> <b>length.</b> The Asnières railway bridge, and the industrial buildings of Clichy are in the background. Locations such as this one were sometimes shown on French nineteenth century maps as Baignade (or, ‘bathing area’).|$|E
500|$|Under ideal {{conditions}} (uniform gentle slope on a homogeneously erodible substrate), the sinuosity of a meandering river approaches [...] The sinuosity is the ratio between the <b>actual</b> <b>length</b> and the straight-line distance from source to mouth. Faster currents along the outside edges of a river's bends cause more erosion than along the inside edges, thus pushing the bends even farther out, {{and increasing the}} overall loopiness of the river. However, that loopiness eventually causes the river to double back on itself in places and [...] "short-circuit", creating an ox-bow lake in the process. The balance between these two opposing factors leads to an average ratio of [...] between the <b>actual</b> <b>length</b> and the direct distance between source and mouth.|$|E

500|$|When routes are completed, {{documents}} are unlocked that provide {{insights into the}} game's overarching storyline. These documents can be viewed {{at any time in}} the game's archive feature, which is accessed from the title screen. After obtaining the four specific endings required to trigger it, the player is given a new prompt to either [...] "fulfill the promise" [...] or live [...] "a normal life" [...] upon starting a new game. Choosing to live a normal life will result in a normal playthrough, while choosing to fulfill the promise locks the player into the true route or scenario Bad Boys Love, or BBL (also known as Hurtful Boyfriend), which explores the full extent of the underlying plot alluded to by the documents and various points of foreshadowing in the dating simulation portion of the game. If the player chooses to fulfill the promise, aside from several dream sequences, gameplay at first appears to continue normally until the in-game date is 2 September. The player's perspective then switches from the protagonist to the protagonist's best friend, and the events of the scenario begin regardless of any other choices made by the player up to that point. If the player obtains all other possible endings prior to starting Bad Boys Love, an extended epilogue plays after the game's credits upon completion of the scenario. In a departure from the generally lighthearted romantic routes, Bad Boys Love is presented as a murder mystery psychological thriller, and is significantly longer than any other route in Hatoful Boyfriend, making up most of the game's <b>actual</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Futurism as a {{literary}} movement made its official debut with F.T. Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism (1909), as it delineated the various ideals Futurist poetry should strive for. Poetry, the predominate medium of Futurist literature, can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyper-conciseness (not {{to be confused with}} the <b>actual</b> <b>length</b> of the poem). [...] The Futurists called their style of poetry parole in libertà (word autonomy) in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern. In this way, the Futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation, and metrics that allowed for free expression.|$|E
2500|$|The other {{consequence}} of tidal acceleration is the deceleration of {{the rotation of}} Earth. The rotation of Earth is somewhat erratic on all time scales (from hours to centuries) due to various causes. The small tidal effect cannot be observed in a short period, but the cumulative effect on Earth's rotation as measured with a stable clock (ephemeris time, atomic time) of a shortfall of even a few milliseconds every day becomes readily noticeable in a few centuries. Since some event in the remote past, more days and hours have passed (as measured in full rotations of Earth) (Universal Time) than would be measured by stable clocks calibrated to the present, longer length of the day (ephemeris time). This is known as ΔT. Recent values {{can be obtained from}} the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS). [...] A table of the <b>actual</b> <b>length</b> of the day in the past few centuries is also available.|$|E
2500|$|The {{length of}} ladies' evening gloves are {{referred}} to in terms of [...] "buttons", whether they in fact have buttons or not. The word is derived from French, and the exact measure is actually a bit longer than one inch. Wrist length gloves are usually eight-button, those at the elbow are 16, mid-biceps are 22 and full shoulder length are 30. Opera gloves are between 16 and 22inches long, though some gloves can be as long as 29 or 30inches. To fit oneself for gloves, measure all around the hand at the widest part of the palm where the knuckles are, but excluding the thumb. The measurement in inches is the glove size, but if one's arms are large, it may be practical to go up a size. Generally, an evening glove {{is considered to be}} a true [...] "opera-length" [...] glove if it reaches to mid-biceps or higher on the wearer's arm, notwithstanding its <b>actual</b> <b>length</b> in inches or buttons; therefore, a petite woman might find a glove with a measurement of 16 or 17inches adequate for the purpose, while a tall woman might need a glove longer than 22inches. A glove shorter than elbow-length should not be referred to as an [...] "opera-length glove" [...] or [...] "opera glove" [...] under any circumstances.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{applicability}} of gray scale inversion in performing digital linear endodontic measurements. Standardized digital images were taken of 40 extracted human permanent single-rooted teeth with K-files size 15 placed at different lengths in the root canal, using the CDR Wireless® digital system. All images were treated with Positive, a digital tool that inverts the grayscale value. Eight radiologists measured the distance between the lower limit of the rubber stop and the tip of the file on both original and positive images. After 15 days, they repeated this procedure in 50 % of the image samples. The intra- and inter-examiner agreement was analyzed by intraclass correlation test, and the comparison between the two image groups and the <b>actual</b> <b>lengths</b> by the Student's t-test (&# 945;= 0. 05). Intra- and inter-examiner evaluation showed high reproducibility (r> 0. 95) of both original and positive images. No statistically significant differences (p> 0. 05) were found between measurements performed on original and positive images, but both differed significantly from the <b>actual</b> <b>lengths</b> (p< 0. 05). Gray scale inversion has low applicability in measuring endodontic files, since it did not improve the accuracy of measurements...|$|R

2500|$|A [...] "new moon" [...] (astronomically {{called a}} lunar {{conjunction}} and, in Hebrew, a molad) {{is the moment}} at which the sun and moon are aligned horizontally {{with respect to a}} north-south line (technically, they have the same ecliptical longitude). The period between two new moons is a synodic month. The <b>actual</b> <b>length</b> of a synodic month varies from about 29 days 6 hours and 30 minutes (29.27 days) to about 29 days and 20 hours (29.83 days), a variation range of about 13 hours and 30 minutes. Accordingly, for convenience, a long-term average length, identical to the mean synodic month of ancient times (also called the molad interval) is used. The molad interval is [...] days, or 29 days, 12 hours, and 793 [...] "parts" [...] (1 [...] "part" [...] = 1/18 minute; 3 [...] "parts" [...] = 10 seconds) (i.e., 29.530594 days), and is the same value determined by the Babylonians in their System B about 300 BCE and was adopted by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus in the 2nd century BCE and by the Alexandrian astronomer Ptolemy in the Almagest four centuries later (who cited Hipparchus as his source). Its remarkable accuracy (less than one second from the true value) is thought to have been achieved using records of lunar eclipses from the 8th to 5th centuries BCE.|$|E

According to Oliver's mathematical reckoning, they were cut in the exact centre of the base of the idol, and about thirty feet below the actual body of the crouching sphinx. As a matter of fact this reckoning was wrong in several particulars, the charges having been set farther toward the east or head of the sphinx and higher up in the base than he supposed. When it is remembered that he had found no opportunity of measuring the monument which practically we had only seen once from behind under conditions not favourable to accuracy in such respects, or of knowing its <b>actual</b> <b>length</b> and depth, these trifling errors were not remarkable.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the accuracy of Root ZX in determining working length in presence of normal saline, 0. 2 % chlorhexidine and 2. 5 % of sodium hypochlorite. Material and Methods: Sixty extracted, single rooted, single canal human teeth were used. Teeth were decoronated at CEJ and <b>actual</b> canal <b>length</b> determined. Then working length measurements were obtained with Root ZX in presence of normal saline 0. 9 %, 0. 2 % chlorhexidine and 2. 5 % NaOCl. The working length obtained with Root ZX were compared with <b>actual</b> canal <b>length</b> and subjected to statistical analysis. Results: No statistical {{significant difference was found}} between <b>actual</b> canal <b>length</b> and Root ZX measurements in presence of normal saline and 0. 2 % chlorhexidine. Highly statistical difference was found between <b>actual</b> canal <b>length</b> and Root ZX measurements in presence of 2. 5 % of NaOCl, however all the measurements were within the clinically acceptable range of ± 0. 5 mm. Conclusion: The accuracy of EL measurement of Root ZX within± 0. 5 mm of AL was consistently high in the presence of 0. 2 % chlorhexidine, normal saline and 2. 5 % sodium hypochlorite.

40|$|Aim: This {{in vitro}} study {{evaluated}} {{the accuracy of}} primary incisor lengths determined by digital and conventional radiography compared to the <b>actual</b> tooth <b>length.</b> Methods: Twenty extracted primary maxillary incisors were mounted in acrylic blocks. Tooth length was estimated by using a straight-line measurement provided by the distance measurement tool of a digital dental imaging system (Computed Dental Radiography, Schick Technologies Inc.) and conventional E-speed film radiographs by using a digital caliper. Two operators familiar with both radiographic methods performed the estimates. The estimated tooth lengths were compared to the <b>actual</b> tooth <b>lengths</b> measured with the digital caliper. Data were statistically analyzed by Dahlberg's equation, paired t test, Pearson's correlation coefficient and ANOVA at 5 % significance level. Results: There were {{no statistically significant differences}} (p = 0. 85) between tooth length estimated on digital and conventional radiographs. Admitting as clinically acceptable a 0. 5 -mm discrepancy between the <b>actual</b> tooth <b>lengths</b> and the radiographically estimated lengths, 60 % of the radiographic measurements were considered as accurate. When the acceptable difference range was 1. 0 mm, the accuracy of the radiographic measurements increased to 100 %.

6000|$|To {{prove that}} this is not an {{isolated}} case, Professor Milne Edwards also gives a table showing the amount of variation in the museum specimens of six common species of lizards, also taking the head as the standard, so that the comparative variation of each part to the head is given. In the accompanying diagram (Fig. 2) the variations are exhibited by means of lines of varying length. It will be understood that, however much the specimens varied in size, if they had kept the same proportions, the variation line would have been in every case reduced to a point, as in the neck of L. velox which exhibits no variation. The different proportions of the variation lines for each species may show a distinct mode of variation, or may be merely due to the small and differing number of specimens; for it is certain that whatever amount of variation occurs among a few specimens will be greatly increased when a much larger number of specimens are examined. That the amount of variation is large, may be seen by comparing it with the <b>actual</b> <b>length</b> of the head (given below the diagram) which was used as a standard in determining the variation, but which itself seems not to have varied.[19] ...|$|E
60|$|The first bird taken is {{the common}} Bob-o-link or Rice-bird (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), and the Diagram, Fig. 4, {{exhibits}} the variations of seven important characters in twenty male adult specimens.[21] These characters are--the lengths of the body, wing, tail, tarsus, middle toe, outer toe, and hind toe, being as many as can be conveniently exhibited in one diagram. The length {{of the body is}} not given by Mr. Allen, but as it forms a convenient standard of comparison, it has been obtained by deducting the length of the tail from the total length of the birds as given by him. The diagram has been constructed as follows:--The twenty specimens are first arranged in a series according to the body-lengths (which may be considered to give the size of the bird), from the shortest to the longest, and the same number of vertical lines are drawn, numbered from one to twenty. In this case (and wherever practicable) the body-length is measured from the lower line of the diagram, so that the <b>actual</b> <b>length</b> of the bird is exhibited as well as the actual variations of length. These can be well estimated by means of the horizontal line drawn at the mean between the two extremes, and it will be seen that one-fifth {{of the total number of}} specimens taken on either side exhibits a very large amount of variation, which would of course be very much greater if a hundred or more specimens were compared. The lengths of the wing, tail, and other parts are then laid down, and the diagram thus exhibits at a glance the comparative variation of these parts in every specimen as well as the actual amount of variation in the twenty specimens; and we are thus enabled to arrive at some important conclusions.|$|E
