25|$|After {{moving to}} the borough in 1867, William and Thomas Hoopes (distant cousins of Josiah and Abner) {{established}} <b>a</b> <b>spoke</b> works. They purchased a site on Market Street from a coal yard operator and opened for business in September 1867, though they were not immediately successful. They invited their relative Edward S. Darlington to join the firm and began manufacturing complete sets of wheels in 1869. About a hundred men were employed in various capacities by the spoke works by 1872, such as cutting, hauling, and turning wood with circular saws. Exports of their products reached as far as Europe and the Pacific Coast. With the panic of 1873, profits suffered, and the firm accused the West Chester Railroad of price gouging. Despite threatening to move the factory to Chester or Philadelphia, the Hoopes Brothers & Darlington (as the firm was known) stayed put and the business recovered by 1880. The firm merged with 14 other companies to form the American Wheel Company in 1889, but the Hoopes Brothers and Darlington bought out their share in 1892. The company began producing wooden bicycle wheels in 1894.|$|E

Also, the spokes were so designed such that the face of a cell in <b>a</b> <b>spoke</b> saw the back of cells in another spoke. This way, communication between prisoners was impossible. They were all in solitary confinement.|$|E

In October 2001, Patrick alluded to a song by the title [...] "Don't Give an Inch", which he described as sounding similar to past Filter tracks [...] "Stuck in Here" [...] and [...] "Take a Picture". He stated the track's lyrics were about not being afraid of who he was, and [...] "kind of a message to all people to focus on being an individual, and less on being <b>a</b> <b>spoke</b> in a wheel." [...] In 2010, Patrick revealed that the track [...] "Drug Boy", off of their 2010 release The Trouble With Angels had actually been written in the Amalgamut sessions.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the sixteenth}} world congress, a major split {{occurred}} in the FI's section in Brazil. The International was doubtful from the beginning about the participation in Lula's government of a leader of its Brazilian section, later saying that [...] "from the beginning there were different positions about ... participation in the government, in the International {{as well as in}} your ranks. But once the DS had decided in favour of participation, without hiding our reservations and doubts, we respected your decision and tried to help rather than put <b>a</b> <b>spoke</b> in your wheel. So we made an effort to convince comrades in our own sections that logically speaking the question of participation in the government should be subordinated to a judgement of the government’s orientations." [...] As time went on, the International became more openly critical of its section's role in government. Members in Brazil were then in two different organisations: a majority group, Socialist Democracy (Brazil), which is inside the PT; and a minority ENLACE current in the PSOL, which opposes participation in capitalist government. However, Socialist Democracy withdrew from active participation in the Fourth International in 2006, leaving ENLACE as its Brazilian section.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the other}} {{recommendations}} in the report was {{the introduction of the}} ring circuit system (often informally called a [...] "ring main"). [...] In this arrangement a cable connected to a fuse, or circuit breaker, in the distribution board was wired in sequence to a number of sockets before being terminated back at the distribution board, thus forming a ring final circuit. In the ring circuit, each socket-outlet was supplied with current by conductors {{on both sides of the}} 'loop.' This contrasts with the radial system (which is also used in the UK, often in the same installation) wherein a single cable runs out radially, like <b>a</b> <b>spoke,</b> from the distribution board to serve a number of sockets. [...] Since the fuse or circuit breaker for a ring circuit has to be rated for the maximum current the ring could carry (30A or 32A for a breaker), additional protection is required at each socket-plug connection. [...] Theoretically, such protection could have been designated either within the socket or within the plug. [...] However, to ensure that this protection has a rating matched to the appliance flexible cord fitted to the plug, a fuse rated between 1A and 13A is incorporated into each plug. Wired connections may also be connected to the ring, and these are also required to include a suitably rated fuse. The ring circuit in the UK requires the use of BS1363 plugs and sockets, but the BS1363 system is not limited to use with ring circuits.|$|E
