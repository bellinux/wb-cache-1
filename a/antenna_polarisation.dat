30|$|Wearable antenna {{placements}} in static scenarios S 1, S 2 and S 3 {{imply that}} the V polarisation of the Rx antenna yields the CP channel, while the H polarisation corresponds to the XP one. Due to the specific postures, this association is more delicate in S 4 and S 5; while the on-body antenna is basically H-polarised regardless of user’s orientation, the channel depends on user’s orientation, varying between CP and XP. A CP channel corresponds to <b>antenna</b> <b>polarisations</b> matched to 0 ° and 180 ° user orientation angles, while XP is associated with 90 ° and 270 °, the other two being approximately at 45 °. Scenario S 5 is similar where, depending on the orientation, the channel varies between matched CP and partially depolarised, with <b>antenna</b> <b>polarisations</b> inclined at ±[*] 45 ° at the extreme.|$|R
30|$|In {{scenarios}} S 6 and S 7, the geometrical {{relation between}} <b>antenna</b> <b>polarisations</b> changes as the user moves. Since movements are somehow periodic and symmetric around the posture of the steady state, the channel polarisation {{state for the}} steady state is a logical reference. Since the steady states in S 6 and S 7 correspond to the static user postures in S 3 and S 1, respectively, one can consider that the channel is CP for the V polarised Tx antenna in these two dynamic scenarios.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} spatial {{multiplexing}} gain based on <b>antenna</b> <b>polarisation</b> diversity are mostly based on channel measure-ments or theoretical propagation models.

These cross-polarised antennas are used for adaptive MIMO transmission for typical outdoor scenarios. Our results are based on real-time multi-user (MU) multi-antenna capacity measurements taken with a MIMO-OFDMA system with parameters close to the current 3 G-Long-Term-Evolution (LTE) standard.

It also provides insight for researchers and engineers who are developing similar platforms.

In addition, we investigate the issue of antenna design for body-centric communications. We provide a thorough wireless coverage study focusing on the challenges of full-house coverage and the effects of the body on the path loss and the packet error rate (PER) in a residential environment. We investigate the trade-off between power consumption and wireless coverage. Finally, we quantify and evaluate the performance of energy-efficient packet loss mitigation techniques, including cyclic redundancy code (CRC) error correction, application-layer coding and <b>antenna</b> <b>polarisation</b> diversity.

30|$|The average XPD {{reflects}} the overall channel’s polarisation characteristics; keeping {{the focus on}} the characteristics of each scenario, the measurements for B 1 are considered for now. XPD varies from −[*] 2.12  dB in S 4 up to 9.73  dB in S 1, typically being positive, thus, suggesting that most of the Tx power is contained in the CP channel. Negative values observed in S 4 reflect the fact that the particular antenna placement and user posture in this case yield mismatched and effectively orthogonal polarisations of the Tx and Rx <b>antenna</b> <b>polarisations,</b> for most user orientations. Similarly, the posture in S 5 is responsible for the values around 0  dB, considering that, in this case, <b>antenna</b> <b>polarisations</b> are typically inclined at 45 °. An interesting observation comes from the values obtained for S 3 and S 6, being characterised by the same wearable antenna placement, the former being a static and the latter a quasi-dynamic scenario. The higher XPD obtained in S 6 implies that the channel can actually gain (on average) from user’s dynamics, as the wrist-mounted antenna is periodically brought out of the shadowed region, while it would remain shadowed if the user was static. Clearly, this cannot be considered a rule, and for some cases the opposite can be expected. While not provided in this work, the analysis of the instantaneous XPD would give a more detailed insight into the depolarisation characteristics of the dynamic channel.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Test {{problems}} for NDE of post-tensioned concrete bridges are {{to determine the}} thickness of concrete, to locate metallic tendon ducts and reinforcement bars {{as well as to}} determine the grouting condition in tendon ducts. Impulse-radar, ultrasonic echo and impact-echo are applied in combination within a scanning system. For applying the imaging echo methods it is necessary to take data in a two dimensional, rather dense grid (mesh width between 2 cm and 5 cm). Therefore time and personel requirements for manual measurements are extensive. In order to enhance the efficiency of the non-destructive measurements several automated systems were developed at BAM. Applying those systems, sensors for different methods can be automatically moved in a pre-selected grid width. Using these systems large measurement areas up to 4 m x 10 m were investigated on several post-tensioned concrete bridges. Automated measurements were carried out also in areas with limited accessability (e. g. box girders). Special data processing and data imaging is used for a more detailed interpretation of the results. Constituents of the data processing are 3 D-reconstruction and fusion of data sets, derived from measurements with different methods or configurations. The detected reflectors and scatterers of the acoustic and electromagnetic measurements can be visualised in slices and movies. From radar data sets, measured in perpendicular directions of <b>antenna</b> <b>polarisation,</b> images of the perpendicularly arranged bars of a reinforcement layer can be generated. The results of 3 D-reconstructions of ultrasonic echo data allow to recognise tendon ducts up to a measurement depth of approximately 55 cm. In summary the combination of the electromagnetic and acoustic methods allows improving and simplifying the interpretability of data. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{mobility}} that {{wireless communication}} offers to users, {{added to the}} ease of installation have increased the demand on such communication systems. However, {{the main drawback of}} wireless communication is the degradation of the signal as it travels through the channel due to the different propagation mechanisms the signal undergoes. To minimise the effect of the channel and get the best service, the base stations must be appropriately located within the environment. This requires proper knowledge of the channel characteristics. Ray tracing software is used throughout this work to generate the channel characteristics of an indoor environment. After getting the channel characteristics, a novel cost function is defined based on the path loss values and it is then optimised. Once the optimal base stations’ positions are found, the minimal amount of power required to cover a predefined percentage of the possible receivers’ locations is calculated. On the other hand, a receiver’s position acquiring enough field strength does not necessarily enjoy the service. This depends on the time dispersion parameters values relative to the symbol rate. The time dispersion parameters have always been ignored in the literature while finding the optimal base stations’ locations. Three cost functions that take into consideration both the path loss and rms delay spread, {{for the first time in}} the literature, are therefore defined. The cost functions are optimised and their corresponding results are compared. Furthermore, indoor environments have always been considered static which is never realistic. They are subject to continuous changes such as opening doors and windows as well as the presence of people. The first detailed analysis and quantified results of the effect of a dynamic environment on the optimal base stations’ positions and minimal emitted power are presented. It is shown that the optimal base stations’ locations and minimal emitted power are sensitive to such environment changes. The environment changes can also disturb the service for active receivers. Three techniques to overcome the effect of environment changes and bring the disturbed service back to receivers are proposed. The first two techniques rely on increasing the emitted power or changing the <b>antenna</b> <b>polarisation.</b> The third technique is a novel technique that gives the base station the ability to automatically move in various directions within a limited distance.

For details on the receiver dipole antennas, we refer the reader to [43]. Considering that one end of the link, i.e. the wearable sensor, is unpredictably polarised, as it is following the movements of the user, such antenna arrangement would increase the probability of successful reception. The input streams from the two radios are required to be combined into one stream after the CRC check. The cost of the solution is a minimal increase in computation complexity at the receiver. However, there are no costs for the energy-constrained transmitter.|$|R

40|$|Cylindrical helix and planar spiral antennas produce {{circularly polarised}} (CP) {{radiation}} {{over a wide}} bandwidth. Unfortunately this circular polarisation is not maintained in off- axis directions. This research investigates the Spherical Helical Antenna (SHA) which is essentially a helix which has been tapered {{to give it a}} spherical envelope. The SHA is shown to produce good quality CP over both a wide bandwidth and a wide beamwidth. Custom FORTRAN code has been written which implements the Method of Moments (MoM) technique in order to model the antenna.

The code is carefully validated against both published results and control software.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} is to investigate the existing photovoltaic antenna integration techniques and develop a new solar antenna integration topology in order to address the drawbacks of these techniques. With the increasing demands for low-profile antennas and a growing move towards the microgeneration of electricity, primarily by photovoltaics, photovoltaic antennas are of increasing importance with a growing amount of research in this area being developed. At present {{there are a number of}} designs for photovoltaic antennas which could be divided into two distinct categories. The first type is the use of solar cells as an RF ground plane, whilst the second type involves the use of solar cells as an RF radiating element. Both techniques bring significant challenges if they are to be widely adopted. Considering the first technique, using a solar cell as an RF ground plane introduces an optical shading problem, which significantly reduces the solar efficiency of the solar antennas using this integration topology. To this end, meshing the RF radiating element is investigated in this thesis to achieve optical transparency at the expense of increasing the cost and complexity of the fabrication process of photovoltaic antennas. Conversely, using a solar cell as an RF radiating element limits the ability to modify the resonance response using traditional RF bandwidth enhancement techniques due to the fact that solar cells need to have a homogeneous structure to achieve optimum solar performance. In order to address these challenges, a third solar antenna integration topology is proposed in this thesis. This method is based upon the use of solar cells as an RF stacked parasitic patch element suspended above the conventional RF radiating element of the integrated antennas. This integration topology enables the integrated solar cells to achieve an optimum solar efficiency due to their suspended position eliminating the shading problem. It also enables the RF radiating element to be modified to excite multiple TMmn propagation modes to achieve enhanced resonance response for multiband and wideband applications. This new topology has been further developed and applied to design a dual-polarised photovoltaic <b>antenna</b> for <b>polarisation</b> diverse communication systems, which has been extended to produce a photovoltaic array antenna for beam steering applications.

Using this knowledge, novel designs that overcome the associated problems of current photovoltaic antennas are presented...|$|R
