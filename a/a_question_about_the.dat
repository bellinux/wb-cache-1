25|$|The later geonim did not {{restrict}} {{themselves to}} the Mishnah and Talmud, but used the decisions and responsa of their predecessors, whose sayings and traditions were generally regarded as authoritative. These responsa of the later geonim were often essays on Talmudic themes, and since a single letter often answered many questions, it frequently became book-length in size. Two important examples of such books are the Siddur of Amram Gaon, addressed to the Jews of Spain in response to <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> laws of prayer, and the Epistle of Sherira Gaon, which sets out {{the history of the}} Mishnah and the Talmud {{in response to a question}} from Tunisia.|$|E

25|$|Encouraged by {{publication}} of Clarkson's essay, an informal committee {{was set up}} between small groups from the petitioning Quakers, Clarkson and others, {{with the goal of}} lobbying Members of Parliament (MPs). In May 1787, they formed the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. The Committee included Granville Sharp as Chairman and Josiah Wedgwood, as well as Clarkson. Clarkson also approached the young William Wilberforce, who as an Anglican and an MP was connected within the British Parliament. Wilberforce was one of few parliamentarians to have had sympathy with the Quaker petition; he had already put <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> slave trade before the House of Commons, and became {{known as one of the}} earliest Anglican abolitionists.|$|E

500|$|A general {{election}} debate, attended by party nominees Shumlin, Milne, Diamondstone and Feliciano and Independent candidates Ericson, Peters and Peyton, {{was held on}} October 9.

Comments {{by all of the}} candidates apart from Shumlin drew media attention and laughter from the studio audience, such as Milne describing himself as [...] "third-generation, born in Vermont", only to correct himself and state that he was born in Brooklyn; Ericson, who sported a large bow-topped hat, suggesting that poor Vermonters use their food stamps to buy lottery tickets and decrying [...] "chemtrails"; Diamondstone, who wore jean shorts with suspenders and long socks and sported a large beard, calling for revolutionary socialism, the legalisation of all drugs and secession from the union, as well as comparing students to [...] "slaves" [...] because of the cost of higher education and responding to <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Department of Children and Families by railing against the U.S. military and the [...] "Zionist regime"; Peters answering <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> affordability of college in Vermont by saying that he had [...] "no idea"; and self-described [...] "light worker" [...] Peyton shouting at Shumlin for allegedly closing highway restrooms and using her closing remarks to ask Vermonters if they'd rather choose money or love.|$|E

According to Spins Jordan Sargent, [...] "Like his new album The 20/20 Experience, in which half the songs run longer than seven minutes, the 'Tunnel Vision' video is self-consciously artistic and mature. But the video is also at times effective, particularly when the editing gets choppier during the bridge." ...|$|E

500|$|The form of {{linguistic}} expression often does {{not correspond to}} the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, [...] "Can you reach the salt?", that is, in fact, not <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> length of {{the arms of the}} one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called conversational implicatures. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring communicative competence in a language.|$|E
500|$|Clark {{returned}} to SHAPE following the summit and briefed the press on the continued bombing operations. A reporter from the Los Angeles Times asked <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> effect of bombings on Serbian forces, and Clark noted that merely counting {{the number of}} opposing troops did not show Milošević's true losses because he was bringing in reinforcements. Many American news organizations capitalized on the remark in a way Clark said [...] "distorted the comment" [...] with headlines such as [...] "NATO Chief Admits Bombs Fail to Stem Serb Operations" [...] in The New York Times. Clark later defended his remarks, saying this was a [...] "complete misunderstanding of my statement and of the facts," [...] and President Clinton agreed that Clark's remarks were misconstrued. Regardless, Clark received a call the following evening from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Hugh Shelton, who said he had been told by Secretary Cohen to deliver a piece of guidance verbatim: [...] "Get your fucking face off the TV.

Breakbot called [...] "Treasure" [...] a [...] "rip-off" [...] of his song, however, he was [...] "cool with it"; {{he explained that he}} also had many influences on his music [...] "with lots of bits taken from here and there". Later in June 2013, Ed Banger from Busy P responded in a Reddit AMA to <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> song and said that they considered it a compliment and that Mars himself said that [...] "Treasure" [...] was [...] inspired by [...] "Baby I'm Yours".

500|$|One {{character}} who {{was cut from}} the pilot episode was an unpleasant, racist, wheelchair-bound old woman named Mrs. Littlefield, supposedly a regular customer of Cheers, who {{was intended to be}} a recurring character. Her lines were filmed as part of a rough cut of the pilot. However, the producers decided to cut the character out of the episode, as they found her character did not mesh with other characters or with the overall tone of the show. Nevertheless, the uncredited actress who played her can still be seen as a background performer in a few scenes. [...] Some sources credit this actress as Elaine Strich, although the unidentified actress who is still seen on camera looks nothing like Stritch. In answer to <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> actress, Cheers writer/producer Ken Levine has stated on his blog [...] "that was not Elaine Stritch" [...] The producers ultimately decided to eliminate Mrs. Littlefield completely from the show from that point forward, necessitating changes to some yet-to-be-filmed scripts for the first few episodes.|$|E
500|$|His {{performance}} {{style has}} been studied by academics who analysed gender, image and sexuality. For example one author noted that Jagger's performance style [...] "opened up definitions of gendered masculinity and so laid the foundations for self-invention and sexual plasticity which are now {{an integral part of}} contemporary youth culture". His stage personas also contributed significantly to the British tradition of popular music that always featured the character song and where the art of singing becomes a matter of actingwhich creates <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> singer's relationship to his own words. His voice {{has been described as a}} powerful expressive tool for communicating feelings to his audience, and expressing an alternative vision of society. To express [...] "virility and unrestrained passion" [...] he developed techniques previously used by African American preachers and gospel singers such as [...] "the roar, the guttural belt style of singing, and the buzz, a more nasal and raspy sound". Steven Van Zandt wrote: [...] "The acceptance of Jagger's voice on pop radio was a turning point in rock & roll. He broke open the door for everyone else. Suddenly, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison weren't so weird – even Bob Dylan." ...|$|E

[...] Hunter thanked the general for his service and then argued that the sole issue was [...] "unit cohesion," [...] mirroring a statement from former Secretary of State Colin Powell. After the debate, Kerr was found to be a member of Hillary Clinton's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual Americans For Hillary Steering Committee. Because of this, CNN removed footage of the question from future telecasts. The next day, Hunter sent a letter to Hillary Clinton that read: [...] "Dear Hillary Clinton, Regarding the [...] "plant", retired Brig. Gen. Keith H.
