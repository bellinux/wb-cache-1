5|$|Australia was {{particularly}} interested in developing atomic energy as the country was then thought to have no oil and only limited supplies of coal. Plans for atomic power were considered along with hydroelectricity {{as part of the}} post-war Snowy Mountains Scheme. There was also interest in the production of uranium-235 and plutonium for nuclear weapons. The Australian government had hopes of collaboration with Britain on nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Unlike Canada, Australia was not <b>a</b> <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Quebec Agreement or its successor, the 1948 Modus Vivendi, and Britain would not share technical information with Australia for fear that it might jeopardise its far more important relationship with the United States. The Americans were reluctant to share secret information with Australia after the Venona project revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Funds {{for the new}} Bonsall bridge were {{approved}} by the California Transportation Commission (CTC) in October1988, and construction was scheduled to begin in early 1989. In November1989, the California Coastal Commission gave the go-ahead for the realignment of SR76 in western Oceanside, from I-5 to Frontier Drive. However, in February1990, the Sierra Club, National Audubon Society, and League for Coastal Protection filed a lawsuit to have the approval overturned, citing concerns over the destruction of habitat. The Bonsall bridge was completed in early 1990, while the old bridge became a National Historic Place. In 1992, the City of Oceanside offered to purchase land as additional habitat for the songbird, {{even though it was}} not <b>a</b> <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lawsuit. The following year, the City Council voted to use the Lawrence Canyon land for commercial use instead of for the environmental mitigation, thus stalling the project. Following this, the CTC rejected the proposal to build the highway, requiring Caltrans to find another parcel to use for constructing habitat. The CTC did approve the proposal a month later, provided that this land was found before construction began. In October, the City Council decided to use the Lawrence Canyon land for mitigation after all. Nevertheless, a city councilman raised concerns that the expressway would not be adequate to handle 2010 traffic levels.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, 2009, the National Transportation Safety Board {{released}} a report regarding the incident. The report discussed several aspects of the collision, including locations of origin of the aircraft, planned destination, and air traffic control communications. In addition, the report discussed how one of the controllers at Teterboro Airport was on a phone call and did not warn the airplane pilot of the potential conflict. The National Air Traffic Controller's Union (NATCA) then issued their own press release disputing some of the phrasing in the NTSB's report. The NTSB then retracted some of its statements regarding the controller's part in the crash, saying that the controller could not have warned the plane about the tour helicopter because the tour helicopter {{was not on the}} controller's radar. The NTSB also removed NATCA as <b>a</b> <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> investigation as a result of NATCA's press release, as parties to NTSB investigations agree to let the NTSB control publicity during the investigation. NATCA may still submit information to the board regarding the accident, but they will not hold a seat on the investigation board.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} judge certifies {{his or her}} decision, {{which is}} final, to the Prime Minister. The judge must also report to the Prime Minister whether any corrupt or illegal practice was established to have been committed by or with the knowledge and consent of any candidate or his or her agent. If a judge intends to report {{a person who was}} neither <b>a</b> <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proceedings nor a candidate claiming he or she should have been declared elected, that person must be given an opportunity to be heard and to give and call evidence to show why a report should not be made against him. However, where a candidate's agents are found to have been guilty of treating, undue influence or an illegal practice, but the candidate proves that the offences were committed contrary to his or her orders and without his or her sanction or connivance, or that of his or her election agents, that all reasonable means were taken to prevent corrupt and illegal practices at the election, that the offences were of a trivial and limited nature, and in other respects the election was free from corrupt or illegal practice, the election is not void.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia {{signed the}} Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 12 June 1993, and became <b>a</b> <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{convention}} on 24 June 1994. It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was {{received by the}} convention on 16 April 1998. The country is megadiverse with {{a high number of}} species and high levels of endemism. It is estimated to contain 20percent of the world's animal species. High levels of endemism are found on the diverse forests of Borneo's mountains, as species are isolated from each other by lowland forest. There are about 210 mammal species in the country. Over 620 species of birds have been recorded in Peninsular Malaysia, with many endemic to the mountains there. A high number of endemic bird species are also found in Malaysian Borneo. 250 reptile species have been recorded in the country, with about 150 species of snakes and 80 species of lizards. There are about 150 species of frogs, and thousands of insect species. Malaysia's exclusive economic zone is 1.5 times larger than its land area, and some of its waters are in the Coral Triangle, a biodiversity hotspot. The waters around Sipadan island are the most biodiverse in the world. Bordering East Malaysia, the Sulu Sea is a biodiversity hotspot, with around 600 coral species and 1200 fish species. The unique biodiversity of Malaysian Caves always attracts lovers of ecotourism from all over the world.|$|E
