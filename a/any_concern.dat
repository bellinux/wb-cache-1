25|$|Outside {{commentators}} {{have also been}} critical of the decision, since it might discourage whistleblowers. In addition to echoing Stevens' concerns, they have seen it as abandoning <b>any</b> <b>concern</b> for the truth, imposing a heavy burden on a plaintiff, relying on an overly narrow conception of the public's interest, and possibly discouraging people from entering public service. The decision resulted in a lower court changing its ruling in a high-profile case involving controversial academic Leonard Jeffries.|$|E

She says her name is Weena (Yvette Mimieux) and tells George her people are called the Eloi. The Eloi do not operate machines, work, or read, and know little of mankind's history.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} there was a {{movement}} to restrict immigration into the US, as it was widely believed that “morons” or feebleminded individuals were the cause of many societal problems and that border authorities were weakening the nation by allowing far too many of these individuals to enter the country. Ellis Island on New York Harbor was the hub for arrival when the immigration station there was rebuilt in 1900. At first, emigrants were lined up and inspected primarily for medical ailments, initially based on the individual’s overall appearance. More scrutizing inspections were conducted if an individual was flagged for some ailment. For the most part, until this time, <b>any</b> <b>concern</b> regarding mental disorders was limited to psychiatric illnesses. However, as Francis Galton’s ideas regarding eugenics. became more popular in the early 1900s, concerns for that feebleminded individuals were weakening society grew, and mental deficiency among emigrants also became a concern. Another important contributing factor was the development of intelligence tests during this time. Both Alfred Binet and his student Theodore Simon were leaders in this development. Henry Goddard, a prominent eugenicist of the time who had been using Binet and Simon’s scale to measure intelligence in adults, suggested that theses could be used to identify feebleminded or mentally deficient individuals at Ellis Island who posed a threat to the integrity of society. By 1910, the concerns for mentally defective people entering the United States had grown {{to such an extent that}} the officials at Ellis Island invited Henry Goddard to teach the physicians about intelligence testing. However, after spending an entire day there, Goddard had no recommendations for the physicians, as he was impressed by both the size of the problem as well as the physicians ability to detect defect given the number of individuals coming through the immigration station.|$|E

Cain also noted that a debris event was recorded on the orbiter's wing leading edge sensors, but it was far below the force that would indicate a problem, and would not impact the mission.

That day, the share price of Enron decreased to $20.65, down $5.40 in one day, after the announcement by the SEC that it was investigating several suspicious deals struck by Enron, characterizing them as [...] "some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen". Attempting to explain the billion-dollar charge and calm investors, Enron's disclosures spoke of [...] "share settled costless collar arrangements," [...] "derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forward contracts," [...] and strategies that served [...] "to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets." [...] Such puzzling phraseology left many analysts feeling ignorant about just how Enron managed its business.

500|$|The case {{ran through}} {{the day and night}} to the {{following}} morning; Rosner notes that even a formal postponement of the case for dinner could have raised questions about the validity of the trial. When the charges were read out, the two defence counsels objected to McDougal and Burke being tried together. James Moncrieff, Burke's defence lawyer, protested that his client was charged [...] "with three unconnected murders, committed each at a different time, and at a different place" [...] in a trial with another defendant [...] "who is not even alleged to have had <b>any</b> <b>concern</b> with two of the offences of which he is accused". Several hours were spent on legal arguments about the objection. The judge decided that to ensure a fair trial, the indictment should be split into separate charges for the three murders. He gave Rae the choice as to which should be heard first; Rae opted for the murder of Docherty, given they had the corpse and the strongest evidence.|$|E
500|$|Broadwater noted, [...] "given the {{difficulty}} of the task he had set for himself, his stubborn independence, and his lack, by 1787, of <b>any</b> <b>concern</b> for his own political future, {{it is not surprising that}} he left Philadelphia at odds with the great majority of his fellow delegates". Madison recorded that Mason, believing that the convention had given his proposals short shrift in a hurry to complete its work, began his journey back to Virginia [...] "in an exceeding ill humor". Mason biographer Helen Hill Miller noted that before Mason returned to Gunston Hall, he was injured in body as well as spirit, due to an accident on the road. Word of Mason's opposition stance had reached Fairfax County even before the convention ended; most local sentiment was in favor of the document. Washington made a statement urging ratification, but otherwise remained silent, knowing he would almost certainly be the first president. Mason sent Washington a copy of his objections, but the general believed that the only choice was ratification or disaster.|$|E
500|$|The NTSB {{investigators}} {{found that the}} weather data that the flight crew received in Medellín was nine to ten hours old. Additionally, the alternate airport on the flight plan, Logan International Airport in Boston, was forecast to be below the safe minima for landing. The NTSB also stated that the flight crew {{should have been more}} aware of these problems and cited these deficiencies as evidence of inadequacies in the dispatch of the airplane. The NTSB also found no evidence that the flight crew ever requested weather information en route or communicated with Avianca dispatchers about their fuel status and intents as other flights did. Flight 52 did not make contact with FAA flight service stations or flight watch en route, and the NTSB was unable to determine why. The flight did not express <b>any</b> <b>concern</b> to ATC about their fuel situation during the first two holding patterns that the flight made. The first indication of worry came at 20:09 when the flight crew inquired about delays at Boston. The NTSB posited that the flight crew might have become confused about the [...] "expect further clearance" [...] (EFC) times they were given. This confusion may have been the reason that the flight continued to hold, burning up its reserve fuel {{to the point where it}} could no longer divert to Boston.|$|E

The extended model, named the EX-PLISSIT model, places permission-giving at the core.
