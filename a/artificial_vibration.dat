40|$|Hatching {{care has}} been {{reported}} for many taxonomic groups, from invertebrates to vertebrates. The sophisticated care that occurs around hatching time {{is expected to have}} an adaptive function supporting the feeble young. However, details of the characteristics of the adaptive function of hatching care remain unclear. This study investigated the hatching care of the subsocial shield bug, Parastrachia japonensis (Heteroptera: Parastrachiidae) to verify its function. Results show that the P. japonensis mothers vibrated the egg mass intermittently while maintaining an egg-guarding posture. Then embryos started to emerge from their shells synchronously. Unlike such behaviors of closely related species, this vibrating behavior was faint, but lasted more than 6 h. To investigate the effect of this behavior on hatching synchrony and hatching success, we observed the hatching pattern and the hatching rate in control, mother-removed, and two <b>artificial</b> <b>vibration</b> groups. Control broods experienced continuous guarding from the mother. Intermittent <b>artificial</b> <b>vibration</b> broods were exposed to vibrations that matched the temporal pattern of maternal vibration produced by a motor. They showed synchronous hatching patterns and high hatching rates. However, for mother-removed broods, which were isolated from the mother, and when we provided continuous <b>artificial</b> <b>vibration</b> that did not match the temporal pattern of the maternal vibration, embryo hatching was not only asynchronous: some embryos failed to emerge from their shells. These results lead us to infer that hatching care in P. japonensis has two functions: hatching regulation and hatching assistance. Nevertheless, severa...|$|E

To confirm effectiveness of this equipment, an experiment was conducted in which the main tower was subjected to <b>artificial</b> <b>vibration</b> while the damping equipment was turned off and then again while it was turned on.

We present a method that determines inhomogeneous mass distributions of the rotor as well as deviations in the pitch angles of the rotor blades from vibrational data only. To this end, a mathematical model connecting the load caused by the imbalances to the resulting vibrations was developed. After discretization, the resulting vibration equation was solved analytically. The inverse problem, i. e., the calculation of the mass and aerodynamic imbalance from vibrational data, was solved by using nonlinear regularization theory.

40|$|A damage {{detection}} method of mechanical {{system based on}} output measurements only and on the subspace identification concept is presented. The method uses the definition of null subspace analysis of the Hankel matrix. It is demonstrated {{to be sensitive to}} small-size structural damages and suitable for continuous on-line monitoring. The measured response records of structures under environmental or <b>artificial</b> <b>vibrations</b> are assembled in the Hankel matrix that is further factorized into special subspaces. The active subspace defined by the first principal components is shown to be orthonormal to the null subspace defined by the remaining principal components. Therefore, any evident increase of the residues signifies possible structural damages. The method is illustrated by an application to fatigue tests of a street lighting device (luminaires). Experimental methods and numerical calculations on luminaires are simply described and discussed. The test results show that the developed methods may be easily used to effectively monitor the damage evolution during the fatigue tests...|$|R

(2004); Rolo et al. (2004). According to authors such Kramer (1996); Andrews and Martin (2000); Sassa and Wang (2010); Huang and Yu (2013) TBJ pyroclastics {{have some of the}} properties that fit the criteria for liquefaction of silty soils: geologic (Holocene), aerial deposit, affected by previous events, loose meta-stable granular soil, low content of clay (< 10  %) and low liquid limit (< 35). Liquefaction can be related to monotonic loading (e.g. an increase in load or sudden loss of toe support) or cyclic loading (e.g. <b>artificial</b> <b>vibrations</b> and earthquakes). According to Bommer and Rodriguez (2002) during earthquakes, tension cracks affect Tierra Blanca pyroclastics, initiating slides. Evans and Bent (2004) conclude that brittleness due to loss of apparent cohesion (suction) or generation of excess pore-water pressure in zones can produce flowslides during an earthquake.|$|R
30|$|The safe {{operation}} of wind turbines requires a well-balanced rotor. The balancing of the rotor requires {{a method to}} determine its imbalances. We propose an algorithm for the reconstruction of two types of imbalances, i.e., mass and aerodynamic imbalances from pitch angle deviation. The algorithm {{is based on the}} inversion of the (nonlinear) operator equation that links the imbalance distribution of the rotor to its vibrations during operation of the wind turbine. The algorithm requires a simple finite element model of the wind turbine as well as the minimization of a Tikhonov functional with a nonlinear operator. We propose the use of a gradient-based minimization routine. The approach is validated for <b>artificial</b> <b>vibration</b> data from a model of a Nordwind NTK 500 wind turbine.|$|E
30|$|The {{problem of}} {{imbalance}} determination was {{addressed by the}} authors in former papers. In this paper we have presented an improved algorithm to reconstruct mass imbalance and pitch angle deviation of the rotor of a WT at the same time. Including pitch angle deviations into the reconstruction leads to a nonlinear forward operator. The regularization of the inverse problem requires the minimization of the Tikhonov functional. Straight forward direct search method proved to be to slow and not stable enough for our purpose. Hence we employed gradient based minimization methods. To that end, we have derived the Frechet derivative of the forward operator that occurs in the gradient of the Tikhonov functional. The accelerated algorithm was successfully applied to several test examples with <b>artificial</b> <b>vibration</b> data. In case of real vibration data we expect equally good reconstruction results as in the test computations, provided that the necessary aerodynamic data of the blades are available.|$|E
40|$|Investigation {{into the}} causes and effects of {{behavior}} has advanced {{our knowledge of the}} effects of social interactions on an organism 2 ̆ 7 s physiology. In Polistes fuscatus, antennal drumming is usually performed by the queen on the cell walls of the nest after larvae reach the third instar. The 2 ̆ 2 mechanical switch 2 ̆ 2 hypothesis (Jeanne 2011) suggests that the drumming experienced by larvae early in the colony season causes them to develop into workers; whereas, later in the colony season, those that do not experience this drumming develop into queens. In this study I measured the distance between the source of an <b>artificial</b> <b>vibration</b> that simulates natural queen drumming and the location of developing larvae. If distance from the vibrational cue affects caste development, then those farther from the signal should develop with more queen-like physiology (measured in lipid “fat” content). Alternatively, if vibrational cues do not dampen as they pass through the nest, then distance should not correlate with physiology. The results of my study show that in our sample there was no correlation between lipid content and the distance between where the larva developed and the vibrational cue...|$|E
40|$|Egg-laying {{decisions}} {{are critical for}} insects, and particularly those competing for limited resources. Sensory information used by females to mediate egg-laying decisions {{has been reported to}} be primarily chemical, but the role of vibration has received little attention. We tested the hypothesis that vibrational cues produced by feeding larvae occupying a seed influences egg-laying decisions amongst female cowpea beetles. This hypothesis is supported by three lines of evidence using two strains of the cowpea beetle (Callosobruchus maculatus), an Indian strain with choosy females and aggressively competing larvae and a Brazilian strain with less choosy females and larvae exhibiting an "accommodating" type of competition. First, in free-choice bioassays of seed selection, choosy Indian females selected control seeds (free of eggs, larvae, or egg-laying marker) over seeds with live larvae (free of eggs and egg-laying marker), but did not discriminate between control seeds and those with dead larvae. In contrast, less choosy Brazilian females showed no preference for seeds containing live or dead larvae over controls. Second, laser-doppler vibrometer recordings confirmed that larvae feeding inside seeds generate vibrations that are available to the female during egg-laying decisions. Third, during dichotomous choice experiments where <b>artificial</b> <b>vibrations</b> approximating those produced by feeding larvae were played back during seed selection, Indian females preferred immobile control seeds over vibrating seeds, but Brazilian females showed no preference. These results support the hypothesis that females use larval vibrations in their egg-laying decisions; whether these vibrations are passive cues exploited by the female, or active signals that 'steer' the behaviour of the female is unknown. We propose that vibration cues and signals could be important for host selection in insects, particularly those laying on substrates where visual or chemical cues may be unreliable. This {{seems to be the case}} with females of the cowpea beetle since visual cues are not important and chemical egg-marking does not last more than two weeks, allowing vibration cues to improve discrimination of egg-laying substrate particularly by choosy females...|$|R
40|$|Seismic waves {{generated}} from earthquakes and <b>artificial</b> surface <b>vibration</b> might alter {{the water level}} in the wells and oil or gas production. These transient stress disturbances prospectively caused the permeability change due to new pathway occurring or existing pathway being cleared. The permeability change might encourage enhancing gas recovery, inducing small earthquakes preventing future large earthquakes, and de-routing underground water flow for various purposes. The prospective permeability increase by axial stress disturbances of Cretaceous sandy shale may effectively expand the capacity of methane gas recovery of Kushiro Coal Mine. The paper observes the permeability change of intact or triaxially fractured Kushiro Cretaceous sandy shale by axial stress disturbances. It will be shown that increasing and decreasing factors might work together on permeability.

5000|$|This is not {{the same}} as self-pollination, despite the common claim that {{tomatoes}} do so. That tomatoes pollinate themselves poorly without outside aid is clearly shown in greenhouse situations, where pollination must be aided by <b>artificial</b> wind, <b>vibration</b> of the plants (one brand of vibrator is a wand called an [...] "electric bee" [...] that is used manually), or more often today, by cultured bumblebees. The anther of a tomato flower is shaped like a hollow tube, with the pollen produced within the structure, rather than on the surface, as in most species. The pollen moves through pores in the anther, but very little pollen is shed without some kind of externally-induced motion. The best source of outside motion is a sonicating bee, such as a bumblebee, or the original wild halictid pollinator. In an outdoors setting, wind or animals usually provide sufficient motion to produce commercially viable crops.|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{are performed}} to investigate edge {{effects on the}} quality factor of graphene nanoresonators with different edge configurations and of various sizes. If the periodic boundary condition is applied, very high quality factors (3 × 10 ^ 5) are obtained {{for all kinds of}} graphene nanoresonators. However, if the free boundary condition is applied, quality factors will be greatly reduced by two effects resulting from free edges: the imaginary edge vibration effect and the artificial effect. Imaginary edge vibrations will flip between a pair of doubly degenerate warping states during the mechanical oscillation of nanoresonators. The flipping process breaks the coherence of the mechanical oscillation of the nanoresonator, which is the dominant mechanism for extremely low quality factors. There is an artificial effect if the mechanical oscillation of the graphene nanoresonator is actuated according to an <b>artificial</b> <b>vibration</b> (non-natural vibration of the system), which slightly reduce the quality factor. The artificial effect can be eliminated by actuating the mechanical oscillation according to a natural vibration of the nanoresonator. Our simulations provide an explanation for the recent experiment, where the measured quality factor is low and varies between identical samples with free edges. Comment: accepted by J. Appl.

40|$|Social insects (bees, ants, wasps, termites) {{are known}} for their unique {{communal}} living. While some insects may live in solitary, producing and taking care of their own larvae, social insects have one reproducing member (queen) {{with the rest of the}} colony insects (workers) taking care of the queen’s offspring. A great deal of research on social insects today attempts to understand what determines why a member of a social colony becomes the queen or one of the workers. In social wasps, some of this research suggests that a wasp 2 ̆ 7 s role is determined through mechanical manipulation and nutrition. Our research aims to answer if the addition of a vibration and the amount of nutrition can affect a wasp 2 ̆ 7 s physiology, gene expression, and behavior. This question was tested by adding/not adding <b>artificial</b> <b>vibration</b> onto a nest and lowering nutrition or leaving nutrition at a normal level on experimental nests. Videos of wasp contests were taken to observe behavior, lipid assays and dissections were performed to review physiological changes, and qPCR was performed to observe gene expression changes.

30|$|While {{collecting}} the following observations, we attached standard accessory pads to {{the leg of}} a gPhone sensor (Meter box). Although this caused decreases in sensitivity {{for a short period}} (Micro-g LaCoste, Inc., 2008), this attachment was added to decrease <b>artificial</b> <b>vibration</b> disturbances caused by a drainage system near the meter at the MIU and by earthquakes that were frequently sensed directly under the OKH (Fig. 1). The level-checking procedure for the Meter box might not have been optimized because it was based on an old manual (Micro-g LaCoste, Inc., 2008, 2010). However, the influence of the incomplete level check was mostly reduced by the data analysis device (Section 3). The timing module was equipped with a gPhone with a GPS-synchronizing rubidium clock and was nonfunctional because the antenna cable was too short. Therefore, the clock of the PC used to control and acquire data was corrected with the Network Time Protocol (NTP). Vibrations from the electronics box—mainly from the uninterruptible power supply (UPS)—were suppressed with a resilient isolator. The sensor drift rates were − 6 to − 5 µGal/day at the MIU and − 4 to − 3 µGal/day at the OKH. Both of these rates decreased over time. Fortunately, these rates are considerably smaller than those of the gPhone- 054 drift (Riccardi et al., 2011).|$|E
40|$|Earthquake-induced stress {{disturbances}} {{caused the}} water level change in the far-field wells. During the Cold War, the <b>artificial</b> surface <b>vibration</b> in Russia to confuse the source location of underground nuclear tests by Western countries promoted the increase of natural gas production of the nearby wells. The above phenomena {{might be due to}} the increase in permeability by the transient stress disturbances resulting from the new pathways being created or the existing pathways being unclogged. Thus, the research was aimed to investigate on the change in permeability due to transient stress disturbance. The permeability change principle might be promoted the enhancement of methane gas recovery, prevention of large earthquake by inducing small earthquakes and de-routing of contaminated ground water flow in the future. The permeability of Cretaceous sandy shale tended to decrease by the disturbances. The smaller the stress amplitude, the larger the decrease in the permeability was. However, the decrease amount was smaller at no disturbances. Increasing and decreasing factors may be working together.

Early detection of faults in pumps can increase their reliability, reduce energy consumption, service and maintenance costs, and increase their life-cycle and safety, thus resulting in a significant reduction in life-time costs. Vibration analysis is a very popular tool for condition monitoring of machinery like pumps, turbines and compressors. The proposed method is based on a novel immune inspired supervised learning algorithm which is known as artificial immune recognition system (AIRS). This paper compares the fault classification efficiency of AIRS with hybrid systems such as principle component analysis (PCA) -Naive Bayes and PCA-Bayes Net.

40|$|Robust {{structural}} {{health monitoring}} (SHM) benefits from a repeatable excitation source, but in buildings and other civil engineering structures this is problematic for many technical and practical reasons. Ambient vibrations are therefore often {{used instead of}} <b>artificial</b> <b>vibration</b> excitation for repeated system identification of such civil structures. In tall buildings, the movement of elevators contributes to the mix of ambient vibrations. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using elevator motion as a statistically repeatable excitation for use in SHM of tall buildings. The 17 -story Factor Building on the UCLA campus is heavily instrumented for earthquakes, and has high-resolution real-time continuous recording of vibration data. There are 72 accelerometers distributed throughout the building in addition to nearby ground motion and borehole reference accelerometers. Using Factor as a test bed, we have conducted the following studies of elevator-induced building vibrations: A) Excitation with a small (100 -lb) shaker placed adjacent to an elevator shaft to estimate frequency response/acceleration; B) Direct measurement of elevator counterweight vibrations to estimate the horizontal elevator forcing function; C) Correlation of elevator motion with measured structural vibrations; and D) Correlation of measured elevator forces with measured building vibrations. Initial results indicate that elevator-induced vibrations are statistically separable from other ambient vibration components in both the time and frequency domains. However, {{it may be necessary}} to add additional data channels measuring elevator position and/or elevator counterweight vibrations.

40|$|A damage {{detection}} method of mechanical {{system based on}} subspace identification concepts and statistical process techniques is presented. The aim is to propose a method that is sensitive to small-sized structural damages and suitable for on-line monitoring. Measured time-responses of structures subjected to <b>artificial</b> or environmental <b>vibrations</b> are assembled to form the Hankel matrix, which is further factorised by performing singular-value decomposition to obtain characteristic subspaces. It may be demonstrated that the structural responses are mainly located in the active subspace defined by the first principal components, which is orthonormal to the null subspace defined by the remaining principal components. If no structural damage occurs, the orthonormality relation between the subspaces remains valid with small residues when consecutive data sets are compared, and these residues may be evaluated by the proposed damage indicators. The method is validated using an experimental mock-up of an airplane subjected to different levels of damages simulated. It is also applied in environmental vibration testing of a street lighting device to monitor structural fatigue evolution. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{non linear}} {{relationship}} between an {{internal combustion engine}} and the engine vibration signals is available. This has been proven {{with the aid of}} an artificial neural network. In the world where various neural networks are available the question arises about finding a more accurate and efficient network. A solution for this can be obtained by training and testing several types of neural networks using similar conditions and data. This was done by using a set of data collected from an engine environment. The data consists of vibration signals collected from an engine test-bed while simulating a set of previously defined faults. Resilient Back propagation, Scaled Conjugate Gradient, Levenberg-Marquardt and BFGS Quasi-Newton were used as the testing neural networks. The performance of each of the neural networks was measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Sum Squared Error (SSE), Epoch and Time. Relatively low values for these measures indicate a network to be better than the others. The results show that according to performance measures, Resilient Back propagation is the best one. Scaled Conjugate Gradient is next in the list and these results were obtained based on the hidden characteristics available in the vibration signals.

In this study, the <b>artificial</b> blasting and <b>vibration</b> monitoring were carried out at the site adjacent to Seongdeok dam, which is the first blasting test for an existing dam in Korea. The vibrations were induced by 4 different types of blasting with various depths of blasting boreholes and explosive charge weights. During the tests, the acceleration time histories were recorded at the bedrock adjacent to the explosion and the crest of the dam. From frequency analyses of acceleration histories measured at the crest, the fundamental frequency of the target dam could be evaluated. Numerical analyses varying shear moduli of earth fill zone were carried out using the acceleration histories measured at the bedrock as input ground motions. From the comparison between the fundamental frequencies calculated by numerical analyses and measured records, the shear wave velocities with depth, which are closely related to shear moduli, could be determined. It is found that the effect of different blasting types on shear wave velocity estimation for the target dam materials is negligible and the shear wave velocity can be consistently evaluated.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} identifying the modal properties of structures using vibration measurements. Modal identification methodologies are proposed based on vibration measurements induced by artificial, ambient or earthquake loads applied on the structure. A modal model of the structure is identified using a weighted least-squares approach and measured time histories at selected locations of a structure. For artificially induced and ambient vibration measurements, the identification is performed in the frequency domain using respectively frequency response functions and cross power spectral densities. For earthquake induced vibrations, the identification is performed in both time and frequency domains. The modal identification methods presented in this work treat generalized non-classically damped modal models. The identification of the modal parameter (modal frequencies, modal damping ratios, modeshape components and modal participation factors) is accomplished by introducing a computationally very efficient three step approach as follows. In the first step, stabilization diagrams are constructed containing frequency and damping information. The modeshape components and participation factors are estimated in a second least-squares step, based on the user selection of the stabilized poles. The first two steps involve non-iterative procedures and result in solving linear algebraic systems of equations. Finally, {{in order to improve}} the estimation of the modal characteristics, especially for the challenging case of closely spaced and overlapping modes, a third step is introduced to solve a fully nonlinear optimization problem using available iterative gradient-based optimization algorithms. In this thesis, theoretical developments as well as software implementation issues are presented. The methodologies and software developed are applied for the identification of the modal characteristics of a small laboratory structure for the case of <b>artificial</b> induced <b>vibration</b> measurements, as well as the identification of the modal characteristics of three bridges, the under construction R/C bridge of Egnatia Odos located at Metsovo (Greece), and two other representative R/C bridges of Egnatia Odos located at Polymylos and Kavala (Greece) for the cases of ambient and earthquake induced vibration measurements.

40|$|A {{large number}} of total knee arthroplasties are {{performed}} every year, during which the knee joint is replaced by an artificial implant. Although literature shows high survival rates, the number of revisions is high, due to the {{large number of}} primary TKR’s: approximately 5 to 10 % of the prostheses need to be replaced within 10 to 15 years. Loosening of a component is a main indication for revision, but the preoperative diagnosis is a difficult one. The existing methods to detect loosening, like radiography, are not sensitive and reliable enough. Modal analysis has been successfully applied in biomechanics to assess the initial stability of a femoral implant, and to assess the stability of dental implants. However, the assessment of the stability of cemented knee implants by vibration analysis is a domain less explored yet. This preliminary in vitro study aims to explore the sensitivity of vibrational techniques in detecting loosening of tibial implants. The influence of fixation between implant and <b>artificial</b> bone on <b>vibration</b> responses was investigated by means of modal analysis. In addition, a finite element model (FEM) was created to represent the artificial bone used in the experiments. This FEM model was then refined by correlating the computational model with in vitro test results. In the experiments, four GENESIS II tibial implants (SZ 4 RT – Smith & Nephew) were inserted in artificial Medium Right Osteoporotic Tibiae (1117 - 130 - Sawbones) with different fixations. The tibiae were suspended on a stiff metal frame by soft bungees, excited by a hammer blow or shaker excitation, and modal parameters and frequency response functions were obtained. Results showed that the fixation of the implant influences the resonance frequencies of the bone-implant structure. In general, a better fixation increases the resonance frequencies and more complicated modes are more sensitive. A FEM was obtained suited for further study. The FEM can be used to simulate different loosening situations and to find the most sensitive vibrational modes. status: publishe...|$|R
