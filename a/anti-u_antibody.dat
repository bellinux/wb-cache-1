40|$|Anti-U {{is a rare}} {{red blood}} cell {{alloantibody}} that has been found exclusively in blacks. It can cause hemolytic disease of the newborn and hemolytic transfusion reactions. We describe {{the case of a}} female newborn presenting a strongly positive direct antiglobulin test due to an IgG antibody in cord blood. Anti-U was recovered from cord blood using acid eluate technique. Her mother presented positive screening of antibodies with anti-U identified at delivery. It was of IgG 1 and IgG 3 subclasses and showed a titer of 32. Monocyte monolayer assay showed moderate interaction of Fc receptors with maternal serum with a positive result (3. 1 %). The newborn was treated only with 48 hours of phototherapy for mild hemolytic disease. She recovered well and was discharged on the 4 th day of life. We conclude that whenever an antibody against a high frequency erythrocyte antigen is identified in brown and black pregnant women, anti-U must be investigated.

Moreover, antigen specificities for <b>anti-U</b> 1 RNP <b>antibodies</b> were examined in patients with systemic sclerosis by immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. <b>Anti-U</b> 1 RNA <b>antibodies</b> was detected in 22 of 36 systemic sclerosis patients (61 %) with <b>anti-U</b> 1 RNP <b>antibodies,</b> 14 of 23 patients (61 %) with mixed connective tissue disease, and eight of 26 systemic lupus erythematosus patients (31 %) with <b>anti-U</b> 1 RNP <b>antibodies.</b> <b>Anti-U</b> 1 RNA <b>antibodies</b> were not detected in other groups. As for systemic sclerosis patients, the frequencies of pulmonary fibrosis and reduced percentage diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide were significantly greater in patients with <b>anti-U</b> 1 RNA <b>antibodies</b> than in those without (76 %vs 18 %, p< 0. 005; 82 %vs 27 %, p< 0. 005, respectively).

[Methods]The frequency of antinuclear <b>antibodies</b> including <b>anti–U</b> 1 RNP <b>antibodies</b> in the sera and CSF of 24 patients with SLE and 4 patients with MCTD, all of whom had neuropsychiatric syndromes, was determined using an RNA immunoprecipitation assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The frequency of <b>anti–U</b> 1 RNP <b>antibodies</b> in the CSF of patients with central NPSLE was examined, and the anti–U 1 RNP index ([CSF anti–U 1 RNP antibodies/serum anti–U 1 RNP antibodies]/[CSF IgG/serum IgG]) was compared with CSF interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) levels and the albumin quotient (Qalb, an indicator of blood–brain barrier damage). CSF and serum antibodies against U 1 - 70 K, U 1 -A, and U 1 -C, including autoantigenic regions, were examined, and the U 1 - 70 K, U 1 -A, and U 1 -C indices as well as the anti–U 1 RNP index were calculated. [Results]CSF <b>anti–U</b> 1 RNP <b>antibodies</b> with an increased anti–U 1 RNP index showed 64. 3 % sensitivity and 92. 9 % specificity for central NPSLE. The anti–U 1 RNP index did not correlate with CSF IL- 6 levels or the Qalb. The anti–U 1 - 70 K index was higher than the anti–U 1 -A and anti–U 1 -C indices in the CSF of anti–U 1 RNP antibody–positive patients with central NPSLE. The major autoantigenic region for CSF anti–U 1 - 70 K antibodies appeared to be localized in U 1 - 70 K amino acid 141 – 164 residue within the RNA-binding domain. [Conclusion]The frequency of <b>anti–U</b> 1 RNP <b>antibodies</b> in the CSF and the anti–U 1 RNP index are useful indicators of central NPSLE in anti–U 1 RNP antibody–positive patients.

IgG fractions positive for anti-U 1 -RNP from patients with CTDs bound to the HPAECs. Furthermore, intact and F(ab′) 2 IgG anti-U 1 -RNP purified by affinity chromatography also bound to endothelial cells. The binding activity of IgG fractions positive for anti-U 1 -RNP to the endothelial cells could be effectively absorbed by U 1 -RNP-Sepharose.

The vast majority (83. 8 %) of patients {{were found to have}} antinuclear factor. Among the SS-associated antibodies, anti-Scl- 70 were most common and were revealed in approximately one-half of the patients. ACA was present in only 44 (14. 6 %) patients. There was a combination of positivity for ACA and anti-Scl- 70 antibodies in 3 patients with limited cutaneous SS, including one with an early form of the disease. 26 patients had <b>anti-U</b> 1 RNP <b>antibodies.</b> Among them, there was a preponderance of patients with limited cutaneous SS and overlap syndrome.

Seventy-seven patients with JOSLE, 64 females, median age 19 years, were consecutively enrolled from March to December 2007. Clinical data related to thyroid dysfunction and lupus were obtained by chart review and patient interview. Serum levels of TSH, free T 4, anti-thyroglobulin (TgAb), anti-thyroperoxidase (TPOAb), TRAb and lupus related autoantibodies were analyzed by standard techniques. Nine patients were diagnosed as hypothyroidism and 4 hyperthyroidism. 28 % JOSLE patients had moderate/high titer of thyroid antibodies: 23 % TgAb, 2. 6 % TPOAb and 3. 9 % TRAb. JOSLE patients with positive thyroid autoantibodies had higher frequency of <b>anti-U</b> 1 RNP <b>antibodies</b> than patients without these antibodies (40. 9 vs. 14. 5 %, OR: 0. 25, CI: 0. 08 - 0. 76, p = 0. 017).

Disease progression in the CIA models in mice and rats with <b>anti-U</b> 1 <b>antibodies</b> was compared. The pathogenicity of binding of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) UL 1 and CIIF 4 to the U 1 epitope and the F 4 epitope (aa 926 - 936), respectively, was compared in vivo and on chondrocyte cultures and preformed cartilage in vitro, using Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy analysis. In addition, UL 1 -induced proteoglycan depletion in vivo in the presence and absence of the complement factor C 5 was analyzed. RESULTS: Increased levels of U 1 antibodies were observed in patients with early RA, especially in association with joint erosions. A significant correlation of U 1 -specific antibodies with disease progression was found in rats and mice with CIA. UL 1 mAb induced, whereas CIIF 4 mAb inhibited, the progression of arthritis. Similarly, UL 1, but not CIIF 4, impaired matrix synthesis on chondrocyte cultures and adversely affected preformed cartilage. Furthermore, UL 1 induced significant proteoglycan depletion in vivo 3 days after injection, {{even in the absence}} of C 5.

The disease was described more than 40 years ago by Sharp et al. During recent years, many efforts to better under-stand clinical and serological features of MCTD have been made. Diagnosis of MCTD can be difficult. Obligatory inter-national diagnostic criteria are required to be fulfilled. Several versions of such criteria have been proposed, but the most widely used one was described by Kasukawa. There is no consensus about treatment – a choice of drugs depends on symptoms. We present a case of a 10 -year-old girl with sclerodactyly and trophic damages of fingers accompa-nied by symptoms of Raynaud’s phenomenon. After an almost 2 -year course of the disease, a diagnosis of MCTD has been established. Key words: mixed connective tissue disease, sclerodactyly, Raynaud’s phenomenon, trophic damages of fingers...|$|R
40|$|In Drosophila, two nuclear {{proteins}} {{of approximately}} 26, 000 and 14, 000 molecular weight are recognized by a human autoimmune antibody for mammalian ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles that contain U 1 small nuclear RNA. The antibody-selected Drosophila RNP contains, {{in addition to}} these two proteins, a single RNA species that has been identified as U 1 by hybridization with a cloned Drosophila U 1 DNA probe. Small nuclear RNP isolated from human cells under the same conditions as used for Drosophila and selected by the <b>anti-U</b> 1 RNP-specific <b>antibody</b> contains eight proteins, two of which are similar in molecular weight to the two Drosophila U 1 RNP proteins. Thus, even though the nucleotide sequences of Drosophila and human U 1 RNA are about 72 % homologous, and the corresponding RNPs are both recognized by the same human autoantibody, Drosophila U 1 RNP appears to have a simpler protein complement than its mammalian counterpart. The two Drosophila U 1 RNA-associated proteins are synthesized at normal or slightly increased rates during the heat shock response and are incorporated into antibody-recognizable RNP complexes. This raises the possibility that U 1 RNP is an indispensable nuclear element for cell survival during heat shock...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between autoantibodies and brain density reduction in SLE patients without major neuropsychiatric manifestation (NPSLE). Ninety-five NPSLE patients without obvious cerebral deficits, as determined by conventional MRI, as well as 89 control subjects, underwent high-resolution structural MRI. Whole-brain density of grey matter (GMD) and white matter (WMD) were calculated for each individual, and correlations between the brain density, symptom severity, immunosuppressive agent (ISA), and autoantibody levels were assessed. The GMD and WMD of the SLE group decreased compared to controls. GMD was negatively associated with SLE activity. The WMD of patients who received ISA treatment were higher than that in the patients who did not. The WMD of patients with anticardiolipin (ACL) or anti-SSB/La antibodies was lower than in patients without these antibodies, while the GMD was lower in patients with anti-SM or <b>anti-U</b> 1 RNP <b>antibodies.</b> Thus, obvious brain atrophy can occur very early even before the development of significant symptoms and specific autoantibodies might contribute to the reduction of GMD or WMD in NPSLE patients. However, ISAs showed protective effects in minimizing GMD and WMD reduction. The presence of these specific autoantibodies might help identify early brain damage in NPSLE patients...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{availability}} of numerous well-characterized Mycobacterium tuberculosis recombinant proteins has revived {{interest in the}} serological diagnosis of tuberculosis. Several promising results have been reported, particularly when more than one antigen {{is used in the}} test. However, thus far these antigens have not been used in routine diagnostic tests because they lack sufficient sensitivity. In addition, {{with the exception of one}} antigen, most recombinant M. tuberculosis proteins do not identify the majority of tuberculosis patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Here, we report a newer M. tuberculosis protein that is a promising candidate for increasing the sensitivity of the serological tests, in particular for patients coinfected with HIV. The protein was found in the urine of mice during the early stages of infection with M. tuberculosis (10 to 14 days), thus suggesting that the antigen is abundantly released during the in vivo growth of the mycobacterium. Reverse genetics was used to produce the recombinant protein, which we named U 1 (for urine protein 1). Using a conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), antibody to U 1 could be detected in 60 % of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis with no signs of coinfection with HIV (n = 83). Conversely, <b>anti-U</b> 1 <b>antibody</b> was detected in 87 % of the sera from tuberculosis patients coinfected with HIV (n = 47). Out of 12 HIV-infected nontuberculosis patients' sera, 9 did not react with U 1 and three sera gave borderline ELISA signals (signal/cutoff of ≤ 1. 75). These results suggest that the high efficiency of U 1 in identifying tuberculosis patients coinfected with HIV may be related to abundant release of this protein during the initial phase of the HIV coinfection. The immediate {{availability of}} the antigen at a time point in which the patient's immune system is still competent would lead to a secondary immune response to U 1 that persists for months in the patient's serum...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) {{is an important}} complication of connective tissue diseases (CTD) and especially seen in systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), and {{mixed connective tissue disease}} (MCTD). In systemic sclerosis, PAH is isolated or accompanied by interstitial lung disease and currently, a major cause of mortality. It {{has been shown to be}} developed in approximately 10 % of cases and annual screening with echocardiography has been recommended. Right heart catheterization is required for definite diagnosis. Limited skin involvement, late onset, Raynaud’s phenomenon, digital ulcers, telangiectasias, diminished nail fold capillaries, antiU 3 RNP and anticentromere antibodies are known as risk factors for PAH development in systemic sclerosis. Following diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) levels can be helpful for evaluating PAH development. PAH in SLE linked to antiphospholipid antibodies and Raynaud’s phenomenon in some studies. MCTD is an overlap syndrome with features of systemic sclerosis, SLE, polymyositis and positive <b>anti-U</b> 1 RNP <b>antibodies.</b> PAH develops in 9 - 27 % of the patients and the leading cause of mortality in patients with MCTD.

40|$|Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) is {{commonly associated with}} connective tissue diseases (CTDs) including systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The prevalence of PAH in SLE {{is estimated to be}} 0. 5 % to 17. 5 %. The pathophysiology of PAH involves multiple mechanisms from vasculitis and in-situ thrombosis to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis which increases pulmonary vascular resistance, potentially leading to right heart failure. Immune and inflammatory mechanisms may {{play a significant role in}} the pathogenesis or progression of PAH in patients with CTDs, establishing a role for anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies. The leading predictors of PAH in SLE are Raynaud phenomenon, <b>anti-U</b> 1 RNP <b>antibody,</b> and anticardiolipin antibody positivity. The first-line of diagnostic testing for patients with suspected SLE-associated PAH (SLE-aPAH) involves obtaining a Doppler echocardiogram. Once the diagnosis is confirmed by right heart catheterization, SLE-aPAH patients are generally treated with oxygen, anticoagulants, and vasodilators. Although the prognosis and therapeutic responsiveness of these patients have improved with the addition of intensive immunosuppressive therapies, these treatments are still largely unproven. Recent data put the one-year survival rate for SLE-aPAH patients at 94 %. Pregnant women are most at risk of dying due to undiagnosed SLE-aPAH, and screening should be considered essential in this population...|$|R
40|$|Studies of B {{lymphopoiesis}} in {{the bone}} marrow of adult mice (1, 2) and rats (3) suggest {{that the rate of}} production is sufficient to totally replace the peripheral B cell pool within 4 - 5 d. This assumes first that there is no significant loss of cells between the stages of A. chain gene rearrangement and light chain gene rearrangement, and second that most of the newly produced surface membrane IgM + B cells are exported from the marrow. While the scale of export is difficult to assess because of the diffuse nature of the bone marrow, in situ labeling has shown that significant numbers do emerge into peripheral lymphoid organs (4, 5). More convincingly, the rate of repopulation of the B cell compartment after depletion by long-term treatment with <b>anti-,u</b> and anti-S <b>antibodies</b> is very rapid and correlates well with this estimate of 4 - 5 d (6). Is the turnover of B cell populations in normal adult animals as rapid as this? Methods for estimating the rate of turnover of peripheral, recirculating B cell populations rely on the assumption that one can identify the entry of B cells, newly emerged from the marrow, into the peripheral, recirculating pool becaus...|$|R
40|$|Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) is {{associated}} with several autoantibodies, {{each of which is}} useful in the diagnosis of affected patients and in determining their prognosis. Anti-centromere antibodies (ACA) and anti-Scl- 70 antibodies are very useful in distinguishing patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) from healthy controls, from patients with other connective tissue disease, and from unaffected family members. Whereas ACA often predict a limited skin involvement and the absence of pulmonary involvement, the presence of anti-Scl- 70 antibodies increases the risk for diffuse skin involvement and scleroderma lung disease. Anti-fibrillarin autoantibodies (which share significant serologic overlap with <b>anti-U</b> 3 -ribonucleoprotein <b>antibodies)</b> and anti-RNA-polymerase autoantibodies occur less frequently and are also predictive of diffuse skin involvement and systemic disease. Anti-Th/To and PM-Scl, in contrast, are associated with limited skin disease, but anti-Th/To might be a marker for the development of pulmonary hypertension. Other autoantibodies against extractable nuclear antigens have less specificity for SSc, including anti-Ro, which is a risk factor for sicca symptoms in patients with SSc, and anti-U 1 -ribonucleoprotein, which in high titer is seen in patients with SSc/systemic lupus erythematosus/polymyositis overlap syndromes. Limited reports of other autoantibodies (anti-Ku, antiphospholipid) have not established them as being clinically useful in following patients with SSc...|$|R
40|$|Objective] We {{investigated}} possible {{associations between}} neurotoxic inflammatory mediators (IMs) and <b>anti-U</b> 1 RNP <b>antibodies</b> (Abs) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of neuropsychiatric {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (NPSLE). [Methods] Serum and CSF anti-U 1 RNP Abs were detected using an RNA-immunoprecipitation assay and CSF anti-U 1 RNP Ab levels were measured by ELISA. IFN-α, MCP- 1 and IL- 8 levels in CSF were determined by quantitative multiplex cytokine analysis. IM levels were compared among anti-U 1 RNP-positive and anti-U 1 RNP-negative NPSLE {{as well as other}} rheumatic disease controls (controls). [Results] Anti-U 1 RNP Abs were detected in serum (58 %) and in CSF (18 %) of 82 NPSLE patients. CSF MCP- 1 levels were higher in NPSLE than in controls. CSF IFN-α level was higher in CSF anti-U 1 RNP Ab-positive than in -negative patients or controls. When limited to serum anti-U 1 RNP Ab-positive patients, however, levels of all three IMs in CSF were higher in CSF anti-U 1 RNP Ab-positive than in -negative patients. Anti-U 1 RNP Ab levels in CSF correlated with CSF MCP- 1, but not IFN-α and IL- 8 levels. Conclusions CSF anti-U 1 RNP Ab positivity is associated with increased level of CSF IFN-α. MCP- 1 levels correlated with CSF anti-U 1 RNP Ab levels, whereas the increased CSF MCP- 1 was not specific to CSF anti-U 1 RNP Ab-positive NPSLE...|$|R
40|$|The Ul small nuclear {{ribonucleoprotein}} (snRNP), {{a complex}} of nine proteins with Ul RNA, is a frequent target of autoantibodies in human and murine systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Anti-Sm antibodies recognizing the B'/B, D, E, F, and G proteins of Ul snRNPs are highly specific for SLE, and are nearly always accompanied by anti-nRNP antibodies recognizing the Ul snRNP-specific 70 K, A, and/or C proteins. Previous studies suggest that human anti-nRNP antibodies recognize primarily the U 1 - 70 K and Ul-A proteins, whereas recognition of Ul-C is less frequent. We report here that autoantibodies to U 1 -C are more common in human autoimmune sera than believed previously. Using a novel immunoprecipitation technique to detect autoantibodies to native Ul-C, 75 / 78 human sera with anti-nRNP/ Sm antibodies were anti-Ul-C (+). In striking contrast, only 1 / 65 anti-nRNP/Sm (+) MRL mouse sera of various Igh allotypes was positive. Two of ten anti-nRNP/Sm (+) sera from BALB/c mice with a lupus-like syndrome induced by pristane recognized Ul-C. Thus, lupus in MRL mice was characterized by a markedly lower frequency of <b>anti-U</b> 1 -C <b>antibodies</b> than seen in human SLE or pristane-induced lupus. The results may indicate different pathways of intermolecular-intrastructural diversification of autoantibody responses to the components of Ul snRNPs in human and murine lupus, possibly mediated by alterations in antigen processing induced by the autoantibodies themselves...|$|R
40|$|The review {{deals with}} the problem of {{antibody}} production in scleroderma systematica (SDS), with a focus on antiribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibodies: frequency, structure, and clinical associations. SDS is a progressive polysyndromic disease with characteristic lesion of the skin, locomotor apparatus, viscera (heart, lungs, digestive tract, and kidneys), and common vasospastic disorders as Raynaud's syndrome, the basis for which are the processes of connective tissue disorganization with a predominance of fibrosclerotic changes and vascular pathology as peculiar endarteritis obliterans. The presence of antibodies to different autoantigens is a distinguishing feature of SDS. Among the patients who meet the classification criteria for SDS, there is a subgroup of patients who are not found to have SDS-specific antinuclear antibodies, but have antibodies to soluble nuclear autoantigens, namely, antibodies to RNP. This type of autoantibodies is described in various systemic connective tissue diseases: systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and SDS. The detection rate of anti-RNP antibodies in SDS varies from 5 to 30 % in different ethnic groups. In addition, positivity for anti-RNP antibodies is a characteristic feature of mixed connective tissue disease. A more detailed study of anti-U 1 -RNP antibody-positive patients with SDS, by identifying a new subtype of SDS, comparing, and searching for dissimilarities of <b>anti-U</b> 1 -RNP <b>antibody</b> carriers from other well-described phenotypes of SDS, is of interest today. This problem is relevant, by taking into account the personalized approach to following up patients, which is actively being elaborated in rheumatology.  </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus 1 Us 11 gene encodes a site- and conformation-specific RNA binding {{regulatory}} protein. We fused the coding sequence of this protein with that of 1 -galactosidase, expressed the chimeric gene in Escherichia coli, and purified a fusion protein which binds RNA {{in the same way}} as the infected cell protein. The fusion protein was used to generate <b>anti-Us</b> 11 monoclonal <b>antibody.</b> Studies with this antibody showed that Us 11 protein is a viral structural protein estimated to be present in 600 to 1, 000 copies per virion. The great majority of cytoplasmic Us 11 protein was found in association with the 60 S subunit of infected cell ribosomes. Us 11 protein associates with ribosomes both late in infection at the time of its synthesis and at the time of infection after its introduction into the cytoplasm by the virion. Us 11 protein expressed in an uninfected cell line stably transfected with the Us 11 gene associates with ribosomal 60 S subunits and localizes to nucleoli, suggesting that Us 11 protein requires no other viral functions for these associations. Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV- 1 and HSV- 2) exhibit a tightly regulated pattern of gene expression for which the virus relies on a relatively large number of virally encoded regulatory proteins.
