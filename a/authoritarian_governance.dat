40|$|According to a "parasite stress" hypothesis, authoritarian {{governments are}} more likely to emerge in regions {{characterized}} by a high prevalence of disease-causing pathogens. Recent cross-national evidence is consistent with this hypothesis, but there are inferential limitations associated with that evidence. We report two studies that address some of these limitations, and provide further tests of the hypothesis. Study 1 revealed that parasite prevalence strongly predicted cross-national differences on measures assessing individuals' authoritarian personalities, and this effect statistically mediated the relationship between parasite prevalence and <b>authoritarian</b> <b>governance.</b> The mediation result is inconsistent with an alternative explanation for previous findings. To address further limitations associated with cross-national comparisons, Study 2 tested the parasite stress hypothesis on a sample of traditional small-scale societies (the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample). Results revealed that parasite prevalence predicted measures of <b>authoritarian</b> <b>governance,</b> and did so even when statistically controlling for other threats to human welfare. (One additional threat-famine-also uniquely predicted authoritarianism.) Together, these results further substantiate the parasite stress hypothesis of authoritarianism, and suggest that societal differences in <b>authoritarian</b> <b>governance</b> result, in part, from cultural differences in individuals' authoritarian personalities...|$|E

Even as urgent struggles continue, it remains clear that authoritarianism will survive this transformational moment. The study of <b>authoritarian</b> <b>governance,</b> therefore, remains essential for {{our understanding of the}} political dynamics and inner workings of regimes across the region. The contributors to this volume consider the Syrian and Iranian regimes—what they share in common and what distinguishes them. Too frequently, authoritarianism has been assumed to be a generic descriptor of the region, and differences among regimes have been overlooked. But as the political trajectories of Middle Eastern states diverge in years ahead, with some perhaps consolidating democratic gains while others remaining under distinct and resilient forms of authoritarian rule, understanding variations in modes of <b>authoritarian</b> <b>governance</b> and the attributes that promote regime resilience becomes an increasingly urgent priority...|$|E
40|$|Why do some dictatorships {{establish}} {{institutions that}} may constrain their leaders? We argue that institutions promote {{the survival of}} dictatorships by facilitating authoritarian power-sharing. Specifically, institutions such as parties, legislatures, and advisory councils alleviate commitment and monitoring problems between the dictator and his allies caused by the secrecy in <b>authoritarian</b> <b>governance.</b> However, because authoritarian power-sharing succeeds only when it is backed by a credible threat of a rebellion by the dictator’s allies, institutions will be ineffective or break down when an imbalance of power within the ruling coalition undermines this threat’s credibility. Our arguments clarify the complex interaction between collective action, commitment, and monitoring problems in <b>authoritarian</b> <b>governance.</b> We use both historical and large-N data to assess new empirical predictions {{about the relationship between}} political institutions, leader survival, and the concentration of power in dictatorships.

40|$|What determines <b>governance</b> {{quality in}} <b>authoritarian</b> settings? The {{existing}} literature on governance concentrates on democratic governance and provides no ready answer. By {{focusing on the}} world’s largest authoritarian country, China, this study delineates an <b>authoritarian</b> model of <b>governance</b> quality. In the model, I argue {{that in order for}} good governance to occur, an authoritarian government must have both the ability and the desire to govern well, and the current authoritarian government in China has both. Specifically, its ability to govern well comes from 1) its sovereignty within the territory, 2) its fiscal resources, and 3) its party-state structure blended with decentralization, term and age limits, and performance-based promotion. Its desire to govern well comes from 1) the regime’s need for political legitimacy; 2) good governance as an important source of political legitimacy; 3) the decay of alternative sources of legitimacy; 4) the double uncertainty of authoritarian politics that compels leaders to highly active in delivering good governance. I formulate key hypotheses and test them with a variety of original datasets. The Chinese County Governance Data are collected from county government websites. The data on county-level public opinion are constructed through Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP) based on the 2010 Chinese General Social Survey and the 2000 national census data. County leader characteristics are collected from Database of Local Officials. The empirical analysis general supports the model. My study reveals an <b>authoritarian</b> logic of <b>governance</b> which centers on the party state’s top-down control and the regime’s insecurity about political legitimacy. My study also demonstrates that China’s model of governance is not shared by most authoritarian countries today...|$|R

This signifies a retreat not only from legal reform, but also from the rule-based model of <b>authoritarian</b> <b>governance</b> that has contributed much to the resilience of the Chinese system.

40|$|In recent years, China {{has adopted}} a range of {{measures}} for information disclosure or “open government information. ” This comes as a surprise in an authoritarian system known more for secrecy and information control. Why do authoritarian leaders embrace such mechanisms, and how do state and society actors respond? This Article examines in particular the emergence of environmental information disclosure in China, and makes two main contributions to the scholarly debate on Chinese law and governance.   First, this Article demonstrates how local demand for legal transplant can arise out of diverse (and sometimes competing) societal interests. State, society and international actors saw in information disclosure law a range of possibilities - the prospect of improved environmental performance, greater accountability to citizens, and strengthened state control. This interest convergence among strange bedfellows has enabled the seemingly paradoxical flowering of disclosure law in China.   Second, this Article unpacks the social effects of information disclosure law in China’s <b>authoritarian</b> bureaucratic <b>governance</b> setting. Where interests are compatible in practice, disclosure has enabled state and society advocacy, and catalyzed new channels for public supervision in environmental regulation. It has also provided a powerful rights-based way for advocates to frame their actions. Yet for all its promise, information disclosure creates risks for those involved and reveals deep tensions in Chinese <b>governance</b> – between <b>authoritarian</b> and bottom-up approaches to rule, and the overarching policy objectives of social stability and performance. These tensions limit the utility of disclosure in practice, with serious potential consequences (e. g., weakened state legitimacy and a hobbled environment) for state and society actors alike...|$|R
