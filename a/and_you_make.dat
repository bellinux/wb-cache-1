"Wannabe" [...] was {{completed}} in thirty minutes—mainly because the group had written and composed parts of the song beforehand—in what Brown describes as a [...] "sudden creative frenzy." [...] During the session, Brown and Bunton {{came up with the}} idea of including a rap near the end of the song. At this point the group got very motivated, and incorporated the word [...] "zigazig-ha" [...] into the lyrics. Chisholm told Billboard magazine: [...] "You know when you're in a gang and you're having a laugh <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> up silly words? Well we were having a giggle and we made up this silly word, zigazig-ha. We were in the studio and it all came together in this song." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, supervising {{animator}} on {{the film}} Scott Clark, spoke about the challenges of animating car characters, saying: [...] "Getting {{a full range of}} performance and emotion from these characters and making them still seem like cars was a tough assignment, but that's what animation does best. You use your imagination, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> the movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don't have." [...] Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: [...] "It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the Cars models, than it did to interpret something like The Incredibles models. With The Incredibles, the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage. But with Cars, it departs completely from any reference. Yes they're cars, but no car can do what our characters do. It's pure fantasy. It took a lot of trial and error to get them to look right." ...|$|E

In 2002, the band incurred criticism when they sold the rights to Jaguar for a car advertisement. In an interview posted on his website, Strummer explained {{the reasons for the}} deal. [...] "Yeah.
