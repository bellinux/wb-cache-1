2500|$|The BJP politicians, as well {{as those}} of other parties, argue that {{demographics}} play an essential role in Indian elections. The BJP believe that the higher the number of Muslims within a constituency, the higher <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> centrist parties [...] to acquiesce to minority groups' requests, which lowers the chances of Muslims [...] "building bridges" [...] with their Hindu neighbours. [...] As such, according to this argument [...] "Muslim appeasement" [...] is the root cause of communal violence. Susanne and Lloyd Rudolph argue that the economic disparity is a reason for the aggression shown towards Muslims by Hindus. As India's economy expanded due to globalization and investment from overseas companies, the expectations of the Hindu population were not matched by the opportunities. Hindu nationalists then encouraged the perception of Muslims as the source of the Hindus' troubles.|$|E

60|$|Countless and inestimable <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> war. Those {{who read}} the story, and still more those who share the dangers, of a {{campaign}} feel that every incident is surrounded {{with a host of}} possibilities, any one of which, had it become real, would have changed the whole course of events. The influence of Fortune is powerfully and continually exerted. In the flickering light of conflict the outlines of solid fact throw on every side the vague shadows of possibility. We {{live in a world of}} 'ifs.' 'What happened,' is singular; 'what might have happened,' legion. But to try to gauge the influence of this uncertain force were utterly futile, and it is perhaps wise, and indisputably convenient, to assume that the favourable and adverse chances equate, and then eliminate them both from the calculation.|$|E

60|$|All such {{forecasting}} is {{the very}} wildest of shooting. There <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> war to put one out, and of a war that changes far faster than the military intelligence. I have made various forecasts. At the outset I thought that military Germany would fight at about the 1899 level, would be lavish with cavalry and great attacks, {{that it would be}} reluctant to entrench, and that the French and British had learnt the lesson of the Boer war better than the Germans. I trusted to the melodramatic instinct of the Kaiser. I trusted to the quickened intelligence of the British military caste. The first rush seemed to bear me out, and I opened my paper day by day expecting to read of the British and French entrenched and the Germans beating themselves to death against wire and trenches. In those days I wrote of the French being over the Rhine before 1915. But it was the Germans who entrenched first.|$|E
