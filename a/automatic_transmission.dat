5|$|In Indonesia, the Camry {{is offered}} with two engines, the four-cylinder mated to a {{five-speed}} <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> This engine is offered in G and V trims. The other engine is the V6 engine mated to a six-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> This engine is only {{offered in the}} top-of-the-line Q trim. The Camry has enjoyed success in Indonesia, being the best selling car in its class. The 2.4 V and 3.5 Q models have been used extensively by the Indonesian government, owning thousands of Camrys in their fleet.|$|E
5|$|Introduced a new {{six-speed}} <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> {{and revised}} styling. The powerplant {{remained the same}} as before. Exterior changes included restyled front and rear fascias, light-emitting diode (LED) taillights, and different wheels.|$|E
5|$|As of 2011 the police's new {{patrol cars}} are four-wheel drive Volkswagen Passat with <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> New {{transport}} cars are Mercedes-Benz Vito for light transport and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter for heavy transport. The police force operates two Eurocopter EC135 helicopters, {{which are based}} at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. In addition, the Emergency Response Unit can use the Royal Norwegian Air Force's Bell 412 helicopters.|$|E
50|$|The 7G-Tronic is the {{fifth-generation}} transmission for Mercedes-Benz. About 65 {{percent of}} Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedans, wagons, and sport coupes are purchased with <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> (with that figure rising). However, about 88 percent of Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedans and wagons are purchased with <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions,</b> and <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> are standard on the Mercedes-Benz S-Class.|$|R
5000|$|... 2007: One of the world's first 8-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions,</b> the 8HP boasted {{to achieve}} an 11% {{improvement}} in fuel economy in comparison with standard 6-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions.</b> [...] Production began in 2009.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> - The plant {{produces}} 5 speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> for the Toyota Camry, Solara, Sienna and Lexus RX 330. It ended 4 speed {{production in}} 2004 and has recently begun 6-speed production {{in conjunction with}} production of the 2GR-FE.|$|R
5|$|Ian Garrad, {{impatient}} to establish whether the conversion was feasible, commissioned racing driver and fabricator Ken Miles to build another prototype {{as quickly as}} he could. Miles was provided with a budget of $800, a Series II Alpine, a Ford V8 engine and a 2-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission,</b> and in about a week he had a running V8 conversion, thus proving the concept.|$|E
5|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with unibody construction, a {{longitudinally mounted engine}} in front driving the rear wheels through either a manual or <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> and live axle rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs; the live rear axle was suspended on leaf springs. The {{rack and pinion steering}} had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E
5|$|Storm II is also {{produced}} in an armoured version, and is offered with an optional 2.8litre VM Motori turbodiesel, <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission,</b> right hand drive, and run-flat tyres. AIL {{is capable of}} completing ten vehicles daily. Due to recently passed tax laws, a civilian version is not yet available in the local market.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> {{are easy}} to use. However, in the past, <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> of this type have {{had a number of}} problems; they were complex and expensive, {{sometimes}} had reliability problems (which sometimes caused more expenses in repair), have often been less fuel-efficient than their manual counterparts (due to [...] "slippage" [...] in the torque converter), and their shift time was slower than a manual making them uncompetitive for racing. With the advancement of modern <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> this has changed.|$|R

5|$|Building on the Omega, the SV6 is {{equipped}} with the more powerful High Output variant of the Alloytec V6 engine, coupled to a six-speed manual or five-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> Air conditioning, a key feature missing on the launch Omega, came standard on the SV6. A body kit and sports suspension similar to the V8 Commodore SS/SS V variants is also fitted. The SV6 sports the Performance interior look, characterised by an accentuated matte black centre console and red lighting, {{as opposed to the}} silver Functional-style interior of the Omega.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Lexus {{incorporated}} the first production eight-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> {{in an automobile}} with the LS 460, and the gearbox was later adapted for the GS 460 and IS F models. Continuously variable transmissions, regenerative brakes, and electric motors have been used on all Lexus hybrid models. In 2007, Lexus executives signaled intentions to equip further models with hybrid powertrains, catering to demands for a decrease in both carbon pollution and oil reliance. Hybrid models have been differentiated by separate badging and lighting technology; in 2008, the LS 600h L became the first production vehicle to use LED headlamps.|$|E
5|$|In China, the Camry was {{unveiled}} in late April 2006 and commenced production in June. The Camry {{is sold in}} two variantsâ€”the 200 and 240. The 200 variant is mated to the 2.0-litre 1AZ-FE while 240 variant gets the 2.4-litre 2AZ-FE. The range consisted of the 200E, 200GVP, 200G, 200GN, 200GGB, 240GVP, 240G, 240GN, 240GGB, 240V, 240VN and the 240VGB. Transmission choices were the four-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> for the 200 models and the five-speed automatic for the 240 models. The Camry Hybrid was introduced in April 2010.|$|E

5|$|A Storm Mark III {{was set to}} be {{produced}} for the Israeli defense forces starting in June 2008, when the IDF was to purchase around 600 vehicles beginning in early 2011. Based on the then new four-door Jeep Wrangler JK design, the Mark III is meant {{to address some of}} the shortfalls of the earlier Mark II. Whereas the previous vehicle was an update of the original TK Storm, the Storm III was designed from the outset with a five-door configuration. Unlike the TJ-L, the new JK Storm has a much higher maximum load capacity in part due to heavier-duty shock absorbers, springs and axles, necessary for an armored version. It includes a standard 2.8L VM Motori turbodiesel and <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E
5|$|A coupe version {{based on}} the Holden Monaro was also sold in the Middle East as the Chevrolet Lumina Coupe. In Arabia, the Lumina was offered in four {{different}} trims: LS (Omega), LTZ (Berlina), S (SV6) and SS (SS). The LTZ and S comes standard with a 3.6L Alloytec V6 and a 6-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> for the S and 4-speed for the LTZ, while the SS comes standard with 6.0L Alloytec V8 with the option of Active Fuel management. A 6-speed manual is standard with the option of a 6-speed Automatic on SS. The LTZ was the luxury model, while the S and SS models focused on sportiness. Exports to the Middle East ceased in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Holden began {{assembling}} the compact HA series Vauxhall Viva in 1964. This was superseded by the Holden Torana in 1967, a {{development of the}} Viva ending Vauxhall production in Australia. Holden offered the LC, a Torana with new styling, in 1969 with the availability of Holden's six-cylinder engine. In the development days, the six-cylinder Torana was reserved for motor racing, but research had shown {{that there was a}} business case for such a model. The LC Torana was the first application of Holden's new three-speed Tri-Matic <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> This was the result of Holden's A$16.5million transformation of the Woodville, South Australia factory for its production.|$|E

5|$|International: sedans and Sportwagons entered {{production}} in mid-March 2009. Internationals are appointed with launch VE Calais V alloy wheels, front foglamps, a six-disc CD changer, leather upholstered trim and steering wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist. Holden reintroduced the International in October 2009. Offered in sedan and Sportwagon body styles, the second iteration was fitted with the 3.0-litre SIDI V6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission; a 3.6-litre LPG Alloytec V6 engine with four-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> option {{was available for}} the sedan only. Extra features include 18-inch alloy wheels, Berlina front grille, leather seat trim and steering wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist for the sedan (already standard on Sportwagons).|$|E
5|$|Like the Berlina, the Calais {{retains the}} {{features}} of the outgoing model but at a lower price point. Offering a blend of luxury and sporting character, it pairs the High Output Alloytec V6 engine of the SV6 with the five-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> Unlike the previous model Calais which featured a semi-sport suspension setup known as FE1.5, the VE shares the Commodore SS/SS V stiff sports suspension. Like the SS, an upscale V-Series edition is available. Being the flagship of the Commodore range, it comes with everything the VE has to offer and serves as a stepping stone to the luxury long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice range based on the VE. The Calais (as well as Berlina) are the only models in the range to feature larger tail-lights.|$|E
5|$|Under an {{unsuccessful}} model sharing arrangement {{that was part}} of the Hawke Labor government reforms in 1989, which saw the formation of the United Australian Automobile Industries alliance between Holden and Toyota Australia, the latter began selling badge engineered versions of the VN Commodore manufactured by Holden. The rebadged Commodores were sold as the Toyota Lexcen, named after Ben Lexcen who was the designer of Australia II yacht that won the 1983 America's Cup. The original T1 Lexcen offered sedan and station wagon body forms in three levels of trim: base, GL and GLX. Moreover, they were only available with 3.8-litre V6 engine and <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> combination.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system remains}} unchanged from Ridge Racer, the checkpoint and time limit system remain the same; {{running out of}} time ends the race and passing through checkpoints grants additional time, although the car drifting is more like Ridge Racer 2. The player drives using <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> or manual transmission. Ridge Racer Revolution supports Namco's NeGcon controller, and adds a rear-view mirror when using the in-car view. The game consists of three courses: 'Novice', 'Intermediate' (also called 'Advanced'), and 'Expert', each having different sections opened, and incorporates modes from the original game; Race, against eleven opponents, and Time Trial, against one. Ridge Racer Revolution adds a mode: Free Run, in which there are no other cars and the player practises driving. There is no lap limit. How fast the cars run depends on which speed grade is used, selectable in Free Run, and can be unlocked for Race. It is not available in Time Trial. A new feature is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place, although this is not available {{at the start of the}} game. Ridge Racer Revolution features a two-player link-up mode which allows the players access to the original Ridge Racers courses known as 'Special 1' and 'Special 2'. There are two modes in two-player link-up: Race, identical to its single-player counterpart, and Versus, where only the players race against each other. Versus features a handicap option, increasing the speed of the trailing car.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Holden {{introduced}} the VK Commodore, with significant styling changes {{from the previous}} VH. The Commodore was next updated in 1986 as the VL, which had new front and rear styling. Controversially, the VL was powered by the 3.0-litre Nissan RB30 six-cylinder engine and had a Nissan-built, electronically controlled four-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> Holden even went to court in 1984 to stop local motoring magazine Wheels from reporting on the matter. The engine change was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in Australia after 1986 had to consume unleaded petrol. Because it was unfeasible to convert the existing six-cylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel, the Nissan engine {{was chosen as the}} best engine available. However, changing exchange rates doubled the cost of the engine and transmission {{over the life of the}} VL. The decision to opt for a Japanese-made transmission led to the closure of the Woodville, South Australia assembly plant. Confident by the apparent sign of turnaround, GM paid off Holden's mounted losses of A$780million on 19 December 1986. At GM headquarters' request, Holden was then reorganised and recapitalised, separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process. This involved the splitting of Holden into Holden's Motor Company (HMC) and Holden's Engine Company (HEC). For the most part, car bodies were now manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia, with engines as before, confined to the Fishermans Bend plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The engine manufacturing business was successful, building four-cylinder Family II engines for use in cars built overseas. The final phase of the Commodore's recovery strategy involved the 1988 VN, a significantly wider model powered by the American-designed, Australian-assembled 3.8-litre Buick V6 engine.|$|E
25|$|TUV300 {{comes in}} manual & <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> Between the two transmissions, there are total seven {{variants}}. There are five variants in manual transmission {{and two in}} <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> The manual transmission variant has power output of 84 Bhp whereas the <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> variant has power output of 81 Bhp. Tuv 300 comes with top variant T8 with 100bhp.|$|E
