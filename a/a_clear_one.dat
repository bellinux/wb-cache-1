60|$|It {{had been}} agreed that no outsiders should be {{told of the}} {{treasure}} hunt, so nothing was mentioned but a summer trip on a steam yacht. The day the Rovers and Aleck Pop left the farm was <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>one,</b> and all were {{in the best of}} spirits. The colored man drove to the depot with Jack Ness and the trunks and dress suit cases, and all of the others went in the carryall, Randolph Rover driving and Mrs. Rover giving the boys final instructions about taking care of themselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were right}} to tell them, Mr. Ducaine," [...] she said. [...] "I have hated myself ever since the other night when I seemed to side against you. There are things going on about us which I cannot fathom, and {{sometimes}} I have fears, terrible fears. But your course at least is <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>one.</b> Don't let yourself be turned aside by any one. My father has prejudices which might lead him into grievous errors. Trust Colonel Ray--no one else. Yours is a dangerous position, {{but it is a}} splendid one. It means a career and independence. If there should come a time even--" ...|$|E

60|$|The butler's {{account was}} a simple and <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>one,</b> and he gave a convincing {{impression}} of sincerity. He had been engaged five years before, when Douglas first came to Birlstone. He understood that Mr. Douglas was a rich gentleman who had made his money in America. He had been a kind and considerate employer--not quite what Ames was used to, perhaps; but one can't have everything. He never saw any signs of apprehension in Mr. Douglas: on the contrary, {{he was the most}} fearless man he had ever known. He ordered the drawbridge to be pulled up every night because it was the ancient custom of the old house, and he liked to keep the old ways up.|$|E
60|$|Preparations {{were now}} {{commenced}} in earnest, to come to. It was time that some steady course should be adopted, {{as the wind}} was getting up, and the schooner was rapidly approaching the land. In half an hour the Sea Lion was bending to a little gale, with her canvass reduced to close-reefed mainsail and foresail, and the bonnet off her jib. The sea was fast getting up, though it came in long, and mountain-like. Roswell dreaded the mist. Could he pass through the narrow channels that Stimson had described to him, with a clear sky, one half of his causes of anxiety would be removed. But the wind was not <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>one,</b> and he felt that no time was to be lost.|$|E
60|$|That {{even the}} wisest of men (in his own conceit) may make {{mistakes}} {{now and then}} is a fact which was beautifully illustrated on this occasion. We may here let the reader into the secret of Jenkins, Smith, and Thomson. They were men who lived by their wits. They had ascertained that a partner of a certain house that dealt in jewellery meant to return to London by that particular train, with a quantity of valuables that were worth running some risk for. On the journey there was one stoppage quite close to London. The run immediately before that was <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>one</b> of seventy-five miles without a halt, at full express speed, which would afford them ample opportunity for their purpose, while the slowing of the train on approaching the stopping place would give them opportunity and time to leap out and make off with their booty. They {{had been told that}} their intended victim was a stout resolute man, but that would avail nothing against numbers.|$|E

60|$|Into {{the details}} of the sport that {{followed}} we need not enter, beyond saying that the Colonel, to his huge delight, never shot better in his life. Indeed, {{with the exception of one}} rabbit and hen pheasant that flopped up right beneath his feet, he scarcely missed anything, though he took the shots as they came. Edward Cossey also shot well, and with one exception missed nothing, but then he never took a difficult shot if he could avoid it. The exception was a woodcock which rose in front of George, who was walking down an outside belt with the beaters. He loosed two barrels at it and missed, and on it came among the tree tops, past where Edward Cossey was standing, about half-way down the belt, giving him a difficult chance with the first barrel and <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>one</b> with the second. Bang! bang! and on came the woodcock, now flying low, but at tremendous speed, straight at the Colonel's head, a most puzzling shot. However, he fired, and to his joy (and what joy is there like to the joy of a sportsman who has just killed a woodcock which everybody has been popping at?) down it came with a thump almost at his feet.|$|E
60|$|GENTLEMEN:--Your {{second letter}} {{on the matter}} of Thornton and others, came to hand this morning. I went at once to see Logan, and found that he is not engaged against you, and that he has so sent you word by Mr. Butterfield, as he says. He says that some time ago, a young man (who he knows not) came to him, with a copy of the {{affidavit}}, to engage him to aid in getting the Governor to grant the warrant; and that he, Logan, told the man, that in his opinion, the affidavit was clearly insufficient, upon which the young man left, without making any engagement with him. If the Governor shall arrive before I leave, Logan and I will both attend to the matter, and he will attend to it, if he does not come till after I leave; all upon the condition that the Governor shall not have acted upon the matter, before his arrival here. I mention this condition because, I learned this morning from the Secretary of State, that he is forwarding to the Governor, at Palestine, all papers he receives in the case, as fast as he receives them. Among the papers forwarded will be your letter to the Governor or Secretary of, I believe, the same date and about the same contents of your last letter to me; so that the Governor will, at all events have your points and authorities. The case is <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>one</b> on our side; but whether the Governor will view it so is another thing.|$|E

5000|$|In December 2013, French General Vincent Desportes stated on Radio France Internationale: This is a {{much more}} {{complicated}} mission than in Mali, where the French armed forces had a simple mission, or at least <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>one,</b> destroying a perfectly-identified and identifiable ennemy. Here, we are talking of interposition between factions. Hence, we have nothing to destroy, no adversaries. The only adversary is disorder and massacres.|$|E
50|$|During the 2003 {{season he}} was struck in the face by a slapshot from Vancouver’s Sami Salo and missed 6 games due to his injury. For the {{remainder}} of the season he played with a clear visor. He stopped wearing a visor until partway through his 2005 season, when he returned with a yellow tinted visor because its color helped prevent glare of the ice from affecting him. McLaren switched back to <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>one</b> during the 2007-08 season.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Hill, Tanton's {{opposition}} to immigration is [...] " on {{the grounds of}} population reduction and protection of an ethnic white majority". According to the New York Times, Tanton has over time increasingly made his case against immigration in [...] "racial terms". Tanton has said, [...] "One of my prime concerns is about the decline of folks who look like you and me... for European-American society and culture to persist requires a European-American majority, and <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>one</b> at that.” ...|$|E

5000|$|He {{warned that}} unless Latino {{immigration}} was restricted it would ultimately [...] "lead to linguistic, economic, racial and religious [...] "apartheid" [...] in the United States." [...] He cautioned, [...] "I've {{come to the}} point of view that for European-American society and culture to persist requires a European-American majority, and <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>one</b> at that." [...] When the WITAN memos were leaked to the press in 1988, Tanton eventually had to resign from U.S. English. although he denied the accusations.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{experts believe}} the first {{porcelain}} {{was made in}} Zhejiang province during the Eastern Han dynasty. Shards recovered from archaeological Eastern Han kiln sites estimated firing temperature ranged from 1260 to 1300 C. As far back as 1000 BC, the so-called [...] "porcelaneous wares" [...] or [...] "proto-porcelain wares" [...] were made using at least some kaolin fired at high temperatures. The dividing line between the two and true porcelain wares is not <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>one.</b> Archaeological finds have pushed the dates to {{as early as the}} Han dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD).|$|E
5000|$|Wolf never {{imported}} nor manufactured ammunition with a {{lacquer coating}} on the cartridge casing. It {{has always been}} an acrylic-polymer coating, first <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>one,</b> and in the last decade mostly a more [...] "frosted" [...] coating. People often incorrectly referred to the clear coating as [...] "lacquer" [...] and claimed it [...] "melted" [...] in the chamber of heated firearms, but it was obviously not lacquer, and numerous articles and videos online have shown that even a blowtorch won't melt the coating or even soften it, disproving the myth of [...] "melted lacquer".|$|E

5000|$|There were {{positive}} reviews of Campus. Rob Clyne wrote for Sabotage Times that: [...] "The overall picture of Campus isn't yet <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>one.</b> At times it {{feels a little}} like a few sketches have been slung together, especially as a lot of the Jonty stuff comes out of nowhere. But these are only small gripes - Campus is hugely original, some may say it is genre defining. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but this is pure entertainment which doesn't need to fall under a specific category." ...|$|E
50|$|The final was a {{hotly contested}} match, {{with both sides}} having great chances to open the scoring, {{particularly}} with a powerful shot from Sergio Agüero {{in the first half}} for Argentina, with Alexis Sánchez having <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>one</b> for Chile in the second half. With the scores still tied at the end of regulation, the match went to penalties. Only captain Lionel Messi netted his penalty attempt, with Gonzalo Higuaín sending his attempt well over the crossbar and Éver Banega having his shot saved by Claudio Bravo to leave the final scoreline at 4-1 in penalties.|$|E
5000|$|... 2. Those of {{the second}} class of steam yacht were built for {{commercial}} use, but gained the 'yacht' title due to their size and design similarity with the private vessels and {{because they were not}} constructed to be mainly cargo- or passenger-carrying vessels, but as versatile, low-draft ships capable of working local coastal routes. This is closer to the original meaning of the word [...] "yacht", coming from the Dutch term Jacht, describing a small, fast commercial vessel. The distinction between a commercial steam yacht and a coastal trading vessel is not <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>one,</b> but the latter term usually implies a mainly cargo-carrying ship. Steam yachts were often run by Packet Companies operating regular, timetabled services between islands or coastal towns. Steam yachts were widely used in the whaling trade.|$|E
