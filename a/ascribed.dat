5|$|During the 14th century, the tengu {{began to}} trouble {{the world outside}} of the Buddhist clergy, and like their ominous {{ancestors}} the tiāngǒu, the tengu became creatures associated with war. Legends eventually <b>ascribed</b> to them great knowledge {{in the art of}} skilled combat.|$|E
5|$|Hall of Poccetti: The frescoes on {{the vault}} were once <b>ascribed</b> to Bernardino Poccetti, but now {{attributed}} to Matteo Rosselli. In {{the center of}} the hall is a table (1716) commissioned by Cosimo III. In the hall are also some works by Rubens and Pontormo.|$|E
5|$|He {{moved on}} {{in the summer of}} 759; this has {{traditionally}} been <b>ascribed</b> to famine, but Hung believes that frustration is a more likely reason. He next spent around six weeks in Qinzhou (now Tianshui, Gansu province), where he wrote more than sixty poems.|$|E

5|$|The Art of War is {{traditionally}} <b>ascribed</b> to Sun Tzu. It presents {{a philosophy of}} war for managing conflicts and winning battles. It is accepted as a masterpiece on strategy and has been frequently cited and referred to by generals and theorists since it was first published, translated, and distributed internationally.|$|E
5|$|The monumental {{events of}} Heracles are {{regarded}} as {{the dawn of the}} age of heroes. To the Heroic Age are also <b>ascribed</b> three great events: the Argonautic expedition, the Theban Cycle, and the Trojan War.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrestrial}} globe is significant in conjecturing that North America {{is separated from}} Asia, unlike the globe of Monachus. Another feature, the shape Mercator <b>ascribed</b> to Beach and Maletur, later gave rise to speculation that the north coast of Australia had been visited in the early sixteenth century.|$|E
50|$|The Torah assigns {{the death}} penalty to {{practitioners}} of certain forms of witchcraft and divination; the Holiness Code of Leviticus <b>ascribes</b> {{the death penalty}} for two of the three necromantic practices, namely Ba'al ob and Yidde'oni, while the Covenant Code of Exodus <b>ascribes</b> it for kashaph.|$|R

40|$|My aim in {{this paper}} is to examine Aristotle’s notions of {{priority}} in order to determine which sort of priority he <b>ascribes</b> to substances. I try to show that we cannot accept the traditional idea that a substance’s priority must be understood as existential independence. Aristotle rather <b>ascribes</b> to substances a priority in terms of completion, as he <b>ascribes</b> to substances-of-something some specific sort of causal-explanatory priority. Besides that, Aristotle argues, against Platonism, that these two sorts of priority (completion priority and causal-explanatory priority) must be kept apart from each other in any successful ontology...|$|R
5|$|According to De ponderibus et mensuris, {{a famous}} 13th century text {{that exists in}} {{numerous}} variations and is often <b>ascribed</b> to Dino di Garbo, the system of weights used in Salerno {{was different from the}} systems used in Padua and Bologna. As {{can be seen from the}} table, it was also different from the Roman weight system used by Galenus and Dioscorides and from all modern apothecaries' systems: The ounce was divided into 9drachms, rather than 8drachms.|$|E
5|$|An epigraphic {{reference}} <b>ascribed</b> to Garulaka Simhaditya, {{the son of}} Varahdas, {{the king}} of Dwarka, is inscribed on a copper plate dated to 574AD, found in Palitana. The Greek writer of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea referred to a place called Baraca, which has been interpreted as present-day Dwarka. A reference made in Ptolemy's Geography identified Barake as {{an island in the}} Gulf of Kanthils, which has also been inferred to mean Dwarka.|$|E
5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is <b>ascribed</b> to the microbes in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E

5|$|Born a slave in Dorchester County, Maryland, Tubman {{was beaten}} and whipped by her various masters as a child. Early in life, she {{suffered}} a traumatic head wound when an irate slave owner threw a heavy metal weight intending to hit another slave and hit her instead. The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of hypersomnia, which occurred throughout her life. She was a devout Christian and experienced strange visions and vivid dreams, which she <b>ascribed</b> to premonitions from God.|$|E
5|$|Ecgbert (diedNovember 766) was an 8th-century cleric who {{established}} {{the archdiocese of}} York in 735. In 737, Ecgbert's brother became king of Northumbria and the two siblings worked together on ecclesiastical issues. Ecgbert was a correspondent of Bede and Boniface {{and the author of}} a legal code for his clergy. Other works have been <b>ascribed</b> to him, although the attribution is doubted by modern scholars.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{died from}} sepsis on 14 June 1922, at the ancestral {{home of his}} wife at Gorhambury, Hertfordshire, England. His obituarists <b>ascribed</b> this to an obscure form of blood {{poisoning}} brought on by gassing in the trenches during his war service. However, his ailments, including fatigue, heartdigestiveneurological disorders, appendicitis, cognitive problems, depression, anxiety — are today recognised as differential symptoms of malaria. Left untreated they sometimes lead to organ failure and death.|$|E

5|$|In 2008 the BBC Three series Being Human {{became popular}} in Britain. It {{featured}} an unconventional trio of a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who are sharing a flat in Bristol. Another popular vampire-related show is CW's The Vampire Diaries. The continuing {{popularity of the}} vampire theme has been <b>ascribed</b> {{to a combination of}} two factors: the representation of sexuality and the perennial dread of mortality.|$|E
5|$|In his {{writings}} Henson {{referred to his}} two regrets in life.

The second regret was {{that he and his wife}} had been unable to have children. They unofficially adopted a succession of poor boys and paid for their education. At least one of them became a priest and was ordained by Henson.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} centuries after Alexander's death, {{probably}} in Alexandria, {{a quantity of}} the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the Alexander Romance, later falsely <b>ascribed</b> to Callisthenes and therefore known as Pseudo-Callisthenes.

5|$|In {{the fourth}} stratum, fragmentary remains of round or {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered. The potsherds {{found in this}} layer date it to Early Bronze Age. In the third stratum large elliptical buildings, {{very similar to the}} structures uncovered in the third stratum in an excavation near Kiryat Ata, were exposed. An abundance of broken storage vessels, in their original place, were found there. This pottery indicates that the building should be <b>ascribed</b> to an early phase of Early Bronze Age. In the second stratum, sections of minor construction and a few potsherds from diverse periods were found. The potsherds could not be attributed with any degree of certainty to the architectural remains. Early Bronze Age II, Intermediate Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age and the Roman period stand out among the periods, to which these sherds are <b>ascribed.</b> A tomb attributed to the Middle Bronze Age was found; it contained scant remains of human bones and a bronze spearhead with a socket. The corner of a building that probably dated to the Early Roman period was discovered close to the surface {{in the eastern part of}} the excavation area.|$|E
5|$|Interpretations vary. The canvas {{seems to}} portray {{simultaneously}} a dreaming {{woman and the}} content of her nightmare. The incubus and horse's head refer to contemporary belief and folklore about nightmares, but have been <b>ascribed</b> more specific meanings by some theorists. Contemporary critics were taken aback by the overt sexuality of the painting, since interpreted by some scholars as anticipating Jungian ideas about the unconscious.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} from Byzantine sources that the Rus' caught Constantinople unprepared, while the empire was preoccupied by the ongoing Arab–Byzantine wars {{and unable to}} deal with the Rus' threat. After pillaging the suburbs of the Byzantine capital, the Rus' retreated, {{although}} the nature of this withdrawal, and indeed which side was victorious, is subject to debate. The event gave rise to a later Orthodox Christian tradition, which <b>ascribed</b> the deliverance of Constantinople to a miraculous intervention by the Theotokos.|$|E
