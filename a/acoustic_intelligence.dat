2500|$|Passive sonar {{has several}} advantages, most {{importantly}} {{that it is}} silent. If the target radiated noise level is high enough, it can have a greater range than active sonar, and allows the target to be identified. Since any motorized object makes some noise, it may in principle be detected, depending {{on the level of}} noise emitted and the ambient noise level in the area, as well as the technology used. To simplify, passive sonar [...] "sees" [...] around the ship using it. On a submarine, nose-mounted passive sonar detects in directions of about 270°, centered on the ship's alignment, the hull-mounted array of about 160° on each side, and the towed array of a full 360°. The invisible areas are due to the ship's own interference. Once a signal is detected in a certain direction (which means that something makes sound in that direction, this is called broadband detection) it is possible to zoom in and analyze the signal received (narrowband analysis). This is generally done using a Fourier transform to show the different frequencies making up the sound. Since every engine makes a specific sound, it is straightforward to identify the object. Databases of unique engine sounds are part of what is known as <b>acoustic</b> <b>intelligence</b> or ACINT.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the relationships between some basic auditory processing skills, subject variables and speech perception ability in young children using cochlear implants. A modification of the play audiometry procedure {{was used to measure}} electrode discrimination and "rate-of-processing" ability in seventeen 4 - 10 year old children. In the electrode discrimination task, children responded with a game-like motor response when a repeating stimulation on a reference electrode "changed" to a different electrode. In the "rate-of processing" task, children had to respond to the "change" to a different electrode, when the duration of the stimuli and the time interval between the stimuli were decreased. Normally hearing children were assessed on this task with <b>acoustic</b> stimulation.

The {{period was}} marked by major new {{technologies}} and transferring results of ARPA research into deployed DOD and civilian systems. The new work included ARPANET expansion and Internet protocols. Other important national security technologies were smart weapons, Anti-Submarine Warfare capabilities using long towed <b>acoustic</b> arrays, artificial <b>intelligence,</b> speech understanding, unmanned aerial vehicle, and defense aid for of U.S. allies. In cooperation with the Defense Nuclear Agency, a Long Range Research Planning Program in 1973 that guided the introduction of ARPA research programs for the next thirty years, and included network-centric warfare, stealth technology, precision and autonomous systems, and theater missile defenses. The efforts were facilitated by creating the classified Journal of Defense Research on Tactical Warfare. Research on the adverse climate effects of nuclear explosions earthmoving applications helped to discourage USSR use. Increased use of email for long-distance collaboration was newly introduced.|$|R

40|$|It is an auspicious {{time for}} this rst-ever ISRR special session {{on the topic of}} {{underwater}} robotics. Underwater robots are now performing high-resolution acoustic, optical, and physical oceanographic surveys in the deep ocean that previously were considered impractical or infeasible. For example: in 2001 the Argo II underwater robotic vehicle, [1], was employed to discover the rst o-axis hydrothermal vent eld located 15 km from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 30 North Latitude [5]. The dynamics of this important hydrothermal vent site have since been mapped, sampled, and probed extensively with human-occupied submersibles, tethered remotely controlled underwater robots, and untethered autonomous underwater robots [6, 4, 7]. The technical obstacles arising in underwater robotic missions dier from those in land, air, and space missions in several fundamental respects: First, the rapid attenuation of acoustic and electromagnetic radiation in seawater severely restricts the range (and eld of view) of high resolution acoustic and optical sensors. In consequence, high-resolution underwater survey sen-sors must be submerged to the immediate vicinity of a survey site | in sharp contrast to airborne and space-based survey sensors systems. Moreover, ra-dio navigation techniques commonly employed in land, air, and space oper-ations do not function undersea. Second, the high ambient pressure of the underwater environment poses formidable design challenges both for (inhab-ited) submarines and (uninhabited) robots. At present, only a handful of the world's submarines are capable of diving beyond 1000 meters in depth. Only one present-day operational research submarines can dive to 6500 meters; none can dive to the ocean's deepest depths of 11, 000 meters. In contrast, numerous underwater robots operate to 6500 meters, and at least one vehicle presently under construction will be capable of 11, 000 meters operation [2, 3]. Finally, in the case of untethered vehicles, underwater missions are limited not only by on-board energy storage capacity, but also by the severely limited bandwidth and delay inherent in underwater <b>acoustic</b> communication, the <b>intelligence</b> of on board control system, and payload capacity...|$|R
