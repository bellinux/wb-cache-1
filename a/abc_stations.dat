About {{a quarter of the}} 225 existing <b>ABC</b> <b>stations</b> followed suit, but such affiliates were mostly in rural areas of the US.

25|$|Historically, {{the station}} has either pre-empted or aired out of pattern certain ABC network {{programs}} {{to make room}} for other local or syndicated programs or because of internal concerns over a program's content. Beginning in 1970, it was {{one of a handful of}} <b>ABC</b> <b>stations</b> that did not carry American Bandstand, opting to air public service programming instead. It also pre-empted Good Morning America for the first five months of its run from November 1975 to March 1976, in favor of the existing local morning program The AM Show (GMAs short-lived predecessor AM America was also not cleared throughout its run from January to November 1975). Because of its hour-long midday newscast – which airs at 12:00p.m.—WFAA has aired programming scheduled during that hour nationally on a day-behind basis at 11:00a.m.: the soap opera All My Children aired in that slot until September 27, 2011, when it was replaced by current 11:00a.m. slotholder The Chew. From the mid-1970s until that soap concluded in December 1984, WFAA aired The Edge of Night (which the network recommended be aired at 3:00p.m.) on a day-behind basis prior to ABC's morning sitcom rerun block, in order to air feature films after General Hospital. Following the midday newscast's expansion into an hour-long broadcast in September 1992, WFAA aired Loving – which many <b>ABC</b> <b>stations</b> in the Central Time Zone normally aired at 12:30p.m.—on a day-behind basis until the soap opera (which by that time, was reformatted as The City) was cancelled in 1996; for similar reasons, it also carried Port Charles on Tuesday through Saturday early-mornings throughout that soap's run from 1997 to 2004.|$|E
25|$|Because many <b>ABC</b> <b>stations</b> {{in major}} Eastern Time markets carried local news at 12:00 noon, {{the show was}} mostly seen in smaller markets and on {{independent}} stations in some larger markets without network clearances (which had affected the previous occupier of the time slot, soap opera Ryan's Hope), and was canceled after one season. The show's 250th and final episode aired on July 12, 1991. Ross Shafer announced that the show would be moving back to CBS for the 1991–92 season on the finale, but this never materialized. The following Monday, Home was temporarily expanded to 90 minutes to fill the show's time slot (ABC returned the noon time slot to its affiliates in 1992). Match Game was ABC's last daytime game show.|$|E
25|$|WDAZ {{was known}} for its {{coverage}} of University of North Dakota athletics, with former longtime sports director Pat Sweeney handling play-by-play commentating. The station produced telecasts {{in conjunction with the}} University of North Dakota for its own airwaves, often simulcasted on its sister <b>ABC</b> <b>stations</b> statewide, from 1984 until 2012. UND play-by-play coverage began being simulcast on WDAZ's airwaves and a cable network known as the University of North Dakota Sports Network (formerly the Fighting Sioux Sports Network), which was launched in 2002. This network, also known as UNDSN (formerly FSSN), broadcast UND hockey, football, and basketball games which were distributed on cable television by Midcontinent Communications and other cable systems in North Dakota, Minnesota, and South Dakota. The UND Sports Network was also available all across the North American continent via free-to-air satellite. Pat Sweeney also handled play-by-play commentating on UNDSN. UNDSN was folded into the regional Midco Sports Network in 2012, and UND athletics play-by-play broadcast rights were taken over by the new regional network.|$|E

25|$|The TV {{rights for}} {{pre-season}} games not nationally broadcast {{are held by}} Scripps television stations WGBA-TV (Channel 26) in Green Bay and WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) in Milwaukee, along with Quincy Media's six <b>ABC</b> <b>stations</b> in the central, northern and western parts of the state, KQDS-TV (Channel 21) in Duluth-Superior, and in Escanaba/Marquette, Michigan, WLUC-TV (Channel 6), along with their Fox subchannel. As such, these stations are authorized to use the tagline Your official Packers station in their market area by the team, and also carry two weeknight programs; Packers Live on Tuesday evening, and the weekly coach's show, The Mike McCarthy Show on Wedneday evenings at 6:30pm throughout the football season. Until {{the end of the}} 2011 season, the team's partner in Green Bay was WFRV-TV (Channel 5), and sister satellite WJMN-TV in Escanaba. As part of the 2012 deal, McCarren resigned his duties as sports director of WFRV to move to WTMJ/WGBA as a Packers analyst, becoming WGBA's official sports director on April 1, 2013 as his non-compete clause to appear as a sports anchor in Green Bay expired, though he retired as sports director in March 2015 to focus full-time on his duties for the Packer radio and television networks. WFRV/WJMN still airs any Packers regular season home games against an AFC team.|$|E
25|$|In April 1998, when KTEN (which {{had been}} {{affiliated}} with ABC on a part-time basis since its sign-on in 1956) disaffiliated from the network, WFAA began {{serving as a}} default ABC station for areas near {{and south of the}} Red River within the adjacent Sherman-Ada market—including Gainesville, and the southern Oklahoma cities of Ardmore, Durant and Hugo—through its existing availability on most cable providers in the region (KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City served as the primary default affiliate for the northern counties of the DMA in south-central Oklahoma). However, residents in extreme North Texas could view most ABC programs that were pre-empted by KTEN via WFAA for several years beforehand, particularly after the former switched to a primary NBC affiliation in 1986 (steadily reducing ABC-provided content on its schedule to select daytime and prime time programs by 1994, when it added an additional primary affiliation with Fox). The market would regain an ABC station of its own when KTEN launched a digital subchannel affiliated with the network on May 1, 2010. Despite this, WFAA remains available on some cable providers in the southern half of the market; Cable One, however, removed the station from its Sherman and Denison systems on February 26, 2015, due to a clause in its retransmission agreement with KTEN that precluded it from carrying any other <b>ABC</b> <b>stations</b> from nearby markets.|$|E

500|$|The PTC {{started off}} 2005 with their {{campaign}} against the Without a Trace episode [...] "Our Sons and Daughters", leading to CBS being fined for indecency in March 2006; the PTC objected to the depiction of teenagers participating in an orgy in that episode. CBS argued that the episode [...] "featured an important and socially relevant storyline warning parents to exercise greater supervision of their teenagers." [...] The FCC fined CBS $3.63 million in March 2006 for this episode, but after a court settlement, the network agreed to pay $300,000 in fines. [...] At the end of January 2005, the FCC rejected a set of complaints that PTC filed between October 2001 and February 2004 for allegedly indecent programs such as NBC's Friends, the WB's Gilmore Girls, and Fox's The Simpsons. The FCC received complaints from the PTC in the summer over an unedited broadcast of the lyric [...] "who the fuck are you?" [...] in The Who's song [...] "Who Are You" [...] from the Live 8 concert broadcast July 2, 2005 on <b>ABC</b> <b>stations</b> on the East Coast.|$|E
500|$|On January 25, 2008, the FCC {{proposed}} an estimated $1.4 million fine against ABC for {{a scene of}} female nudity in the NYPD Blue episode [...] "Nude Awakening" [...] aired on February 25, 2003. Because the episode aired outside the indecency [...] "safe harbor" [...] in the Central and Mountain Time Zones, the fine applied only to <b>ABC</b> <b>stations</b> in those zones. The PTC praised the FCC's action. However, PTC president Winter condemned ABC's decision to appeal the fine in federal court. PTC has also criticized the Third Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to void the FCC's fine for the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. TV series that the PTC has targeted for FCC complaints in 2008 have included NBC's Today morning show and CBS primetime programs Big Brother 10, , and Two and a Half Men. Profanity was the main concern for Today and Big Brother 10, [...] the extremely brief exposure of contestant Marcus Lehman's penis for Survivor: Gabon, and a [...] "lap-dance" [...] scene for Two and a Half Men. The PTC's first complaint in 2009 was over sexual content in an episode of Family Guy titled [...] "Family Gay". Later in 2009, the PTC urged affiliates of The CW Television Network to pre-empt a Gossip Girl episode to be aired November 9; the episode would reportedly contain a threesome scene. In response to Adam Lambert's performance of his song [...] "For Your Entertainment" [...] {{at the end of}} the 2009 American Music Awards broadcast on ABC, PTC urged viewers to complain to the FCC if living in an area where the performance was shown before 10 p.m. local time. PTC complained that the performance contained a simulation of oral sex. Lambert's performance reportedly was broadcast around 11 p.m. Eastern and Pacific time, [...] "outside the FCC's usual 6am-10pm time frame prohibiting the broadcast of indecent material". ABC also received about 1,500 telephoned complaints.|$|E

50|$|Several factors {{delayed the}} {{dissemination}} of {{the news of the}} cyclone's impact. The destruction of transportation infrastructure and the distance between Darwin {{and the rest of the}} Australian population played a role, as did the fact the storm made landfall on Christmas Day and most media outlets had only a skeleton crew rostered on at best. Most Australians were not aware of the cyclone until late in the afternoon. Dick Muddimer, a reporter for the local <b>ABC</b> <b>station,</b> 5DR, was able to travel through the wreckage to local television station NTD and had the <b>ABC</b> <b>station</b> in Mount Isa, Queensland notify ABC headquarters in Sydney that Darwin had been hit by a cyclone.|$|R
