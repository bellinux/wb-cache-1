500|$|Gallagher {{began to}} suffer drug-induced panic attacks during this period. His {{depression}} and paranoid well-being inspired the song [...] "Gas Panic!", subsequently {{included on the}} 2000 album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants. He claimed to have quit using illicit drugs on 5 June 1998. Gallagher stated in 2001, [...] "I liked drugs, I was good at them. But I'd had panic attacks {{for about a year}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> because [...] I wanted to. After you make the decision, it is quite easy." [...] Between 1993 and 1998, Gallagher claims, [...] "I can hardly remember a thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Welling {{was cast}} in the WB superhero drama Smallville after a {{nationwide}} search for an actor to play Clark Kent. In {{an interview with a}} teen magazine, Welling spoke about the day he auditioned for the role: [...] "I was on my way back from the Warner Bros. studio, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> in a gas station to call my manager and tell him how it went. I called and got him on the phone and he said, 'Can you hold on a second?' Next thing I know, there are literally seven people on the other line and almost in unison they say, 'Tom, you got it!'" [...] The pilot aired in October 2001 and became the highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers. Welling told TV Guide that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job. Like Christopher Reeve, he was not a Superman fan prior to being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continues to not read Superman comics: [...] "I made a conscious decision to stay away from that material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously." [...] He did get the chance to meet two previous Superman actors: Christopher Reeve, who appeared in season 2: episode 17 titled [...] "Rosetta", and Dean Cain, who appeared in season 7: episode 4 titled [...] "Cure".|$|E

He {{snatched}} desperately. The man yelled and lost the bread, the dog, gulping, turned to creep away.|$|R

50|$|I plunged {{full speed}} towards the valley. According to Henri Desgrange's calculation, I was then heading the general {{classification}} with a lead of 18 minutes. So, I was going full speed. All of a sudden, about ten kilometres from Ste-Marie-de-Campan {{down in the}} valley, I feel {{that something is wrong}} with my handlebars. I cannot steer my bike any more. I pull on my brakes <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stop.</b> <b>I</b> see my forks are broken. Well, I tell you now that my forks were broken but I wouldn't say it at the time because it was bad publicity for my sponsor.|$|R

6000|$|... "They were {{speaking}} {{the truth about}} you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> them. I told them {{that sort of thing}} wouldn't do. Why, you're getting fat!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I says to myself, [...] "I hope you're a {{harmless}} specimen." [...] Then an idea struck me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> with the knot in my fingers.|$|E

6000|$|A {{little before}} dark I passed a farm-house, {{at the open}} door of which the farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread <b>and</b> cheese. <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be cross, Pigott, dear," [...] she said. [...] "I didn't mean {{to frighten}} you. I couldn't help going--I couldn't indeed; <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> talking to Mr. Fraser." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, what--" [...] <b>I</b> began, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>stopped.</b> <b>I</b> {{resolved}} that I {{would not}} {{ask that question}} again in that tone in that scrape. I would be cheerful and courageous like Kate--splendid Kate! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes. Two weeks ago, in Boston," [...] said Gaites. [...] "Miss Axewright <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> at the S. B. & H. C. freight-depot to {{see that}} your piano started off all right." ...|$|E

6000|$|As I {{returned}} to the inn I noticed a man standing {{at the entrance of}} a driveway which appeared to lead back to the stable-yards. [...] "Here is some one who may talk," [...] I thought, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Well, I {{just felt}} sick. But I says, I GOT to do it--I can't get OUT of it. Right then along comes a skiff {{with two men}} in it with guns, and they stopped <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped.</b> One of them says: ...|$|E
