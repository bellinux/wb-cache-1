40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Background and aims: Identifying {{strategies}} to increase children’s vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> intake at a population level {{is a key}} strategy in the World Health Organization's Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health. Schools are recommended settings in which population-wide vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> interventions can be delivered. This thesis aimed to: 1. Review, systematic review evidence regarding the effectiveness of school-based vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in increasing children’s consumption of vegetables and fruit.; 2. Describe school Principals’ attitudes and reported barriers {{to the implementation of}} vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in Australia; the prevalence of vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in Australian schools; and the school characteristics and implementation strategies associated with school vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs.; 3. Assess the effectiveness of a multi-strategy intervention in increasing the implementation of a vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> program by a population of primary schools.; 4. Describe schools’ implementation of vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs <b>and</b> other healthy eating and physical activity practices across an eight-year period, and to determine if their implementation varies according to the size, geographic or socio-economic location of schools.; 5. Provide recommendations for future research and practice regarding increasing the implementation of vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in primary schools. Results: A synthesis of systematic reviews found that school-based vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs could have a modest impact on children’s combined vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> intake by approximately + 0. 25 serves per day. A cross-sectional survey of New South Wales school Principals found that only 40 % of schools in 2008 were implementing a vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> program to the recommended level. The thesis then demonstrated in a quasi-experimental study involving 828 schools that a multi-strategy intervention can significantly increase the implementation of a vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> program to the recommended level (intervention vs comparison (OR 2. 36; 95 % CI 1. 60 - 3. 49, p< 0. 001). Finally, using a longitudinal cohort study with 476 New South Wales schools, the thesis found that, over an eight-year period, the implementation of vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs by schools increased, as did other healthy eating practices whilst some physical activity practices did not significantly improve. Conclusion: The thesis provides new evidence and methods on how to implement vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in a population of schools. Furthermore it demonstrates a need and opportunity for public health policy makers and practitioners to adopt such {{strategies to}} enhance the implementation of vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> programs in primary schools...|$|R

Objective: We quantified the extent of the shared genetic influence that underlies FF and liking for vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> in early childhood {{with the use of a}} twin design. Design: Data were from the Gemini cohort, which is a populationbased sample of twins born in England and Wales in 2007. Parents of 3 -y-old twins (n = 1330 pairs) completed questionnaire measures of their children's food preferences (liking for vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruit)</b> <b>and</b> the FF scale from the Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Multivariate quantitative genetic modeling was used to estimate common genetic influences that underlie FF and liking for vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruit.</b> Results: Genetic correlations were significant and moderate to large in size between FF and liking for both vegetables (20. 65) <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> (20. 43), which indicated that a substantial proportion of the genes that influence FF also influence liking. Common genes that underlie FF and liking for vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> largely explained the observed phenotypic correlations between them (68 - 70 %). Conclusions: FF <b>and</b> liking for <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables in young children share a large proportion of common genetic factors. The genetic influence on FF may determine why fussy children typically reject <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{vegetable}} <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> {{consumption in}} the New South Wales population is a key public health priority.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit,</b> “other” foods, fibre, folate, vitamin A, and vitamin C intakes of First Nations {{children and adolescents}} residing in seven communities in northern and southern Ontario, including variations by year and community, and comparisons to current dietary standards and national averages based on age and sex. Also, to implement and {{assess the impact of}} two school nutrition programs (in Kashechewan and Fort Albany, Ontario) on dietary intakes of vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit,</b> “other” foods, fibre, folate, vitamin A, and vitamin C. Also, to evaluate the two school nutrition programs, one a simple food provision program in Kashechewan, Ontario and the other a more comprehensive school nutrition program in Fort Albany, Ontario, in terms of student and teacher impressions and program integrity. For the program in Fort Albany, the impact of the program on nutrition knowledge, self-efficacy, and intentions to eat more vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> will also be assessed. Finally, to {{investigate the}} association between Body Mass Index (BMI) <b>and</b> vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> fibre intake in First Nations children and adolescents living on reserve in Ontario. Methods: Dietary intakes were evaluated using 24 -hour dietary recall data collected via the validated Web-Based Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (WEB-Q) between 2003 and 2010 in seven First Nations communities in northern (Attawapiskat, Fort Albany, Kashechewan, Moose Factory, and Peawanuck) and southern (Christian Island and Georgina Island) Ontario. Vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit,</b> “other” foods, fibre, folate, vitamin A, and vitamin C intakes were compared to current dietary standards and Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 2. 2 (CCHS). Yearly and community differences in intakes were assessed using specific dataset pairs to control for season, year, and community, where conditions were comparable. The association between vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> fibre intake and BMI was investigated using the weight classifications described by Cole and colleagues (2000) and based on selfreported heights and weights. The impact of a simple food provision program in Kashechewan First Nation was examined in terms of vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit,</b> “other” foods, fibre, folate, vitamin A, and vitamin C intakes pre-, oneweek post, and one-year post program using the WEB-Q. Finally, the impact of a comprehensive school vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> education program was evaluated in terms of vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit,</b> “other” foods, fibre, folate, vitamin A, and vitamin C intakes, nutrition knowledge and preferences, and intentions and self-efficacy to eat more vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> pre- <b>and</b> post-program using validated questionnaires. Within each program, parent/guardian, student, and teacher impressions of the program were evaluated via questionnaires and focus groups. iv Results: The majority of participants (n= 443 students from seven communities) had intakes of vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> relevant nutrients below current standards, with the exception of vitamin C. Mean intakes of vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> fell below Canadian Community Health Survey averages. Mean intakes of “other” foods exceeded vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> intakes in all age and sex groups in terms of servings. There was no significant association between vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> or fibre intake and BMI. In certain instances, significant variation in intakes existed between different years and communities. Under ideal conditions (short-term, investigator-run portion of the program), the school food provision program in Kashechewan First Nation produced improvements in vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> intakes (n. s.). Long-term intakes did not improve. Teacher and principal impressions of the program were overwhelmingly positive. In the short term, the vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit,</b> relevant nutrient, <b>and</b> “other” foods intakes of students in Fort Albany did not significantly change following a comprehensive school nutrition education program, and neither did intentions or self-efficacy to eat more vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruit.</b> However, the program resulted in significantly improved nutrition knowledge, as well as significant improvements in the number of vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> that participants had been exposed to and liked. The majority of parents, teachers, and students had positive impressions of the program. Conclusions: Overall, the dietary intakes of the study participants were characterized by poor intakes of vegetables <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> intakes of “other” foods that exceeded vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> intakes in all age and sex groups. Rates of overweight and obesity were higher than those reported in the CCHS. With adequate resources and support, school nutrition programs have the potential to improve the vegetable <b>and</b> <b>fruit</b> intakes of children and adolescents living in the communities involved in this research. However, it is probable that the numerous barriers to healthy eating identified in the communities examined blunted the positive effects of the program piloted in this study. Future initiatives should include community-based approaches to improve accessibility of affordable, healthy foods of reasonable quality. In conjunction with school nutrition programs, such programs may have the ability to positively impact the dietary intakes of children and adolescents living on reserve in Ontario...|$|R
