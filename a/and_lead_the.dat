5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour arose from the German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar and his entourage of chiefs should dismount <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> main body of German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in {{the centre of the}} action, he would {{have no way of knowing}} what was happening in other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) and so was able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was likely in the gap between the two Roman lines.|$|E
5|$|At Great Lakes, Collier went {{regularly}} {{to observe the}} practices of the station's service football team, the Great Lakes Bluejackets. There he met Paul Brown, who had left a head coaching job at Ohio State University {{to serve in the}} Navy <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> Bluejackets team. Collier took notes and hoped to pick up some football knowledge he could use when he returned to Paris. Brown, however, noticed Collier's dedication and brought him onto his staff as a volunteer assistant.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} three seasons, the Rockets were {{eliminated}} three straight times {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, with the first of those in 1988, the Dallas Mavericks defeating the Rockets in four games, leading to Fitch's dismissal.

5|$|Fisher {{wanted to}} {{continue}} to serve as High Commissioner in London when his term expired in 1921, but Hughes did not permit it. Upon his return to Australia, there were attempts to secure Fisher a seat in parliament <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> Labor Party once more, {{but he was not}} interested in doing so. In 1922 he returned to London and lived in retirement at South Hill Park, Hampstead, for the remainder of his life. In his final years, Fisher gradually succumbed to the effects of dementia, such that he would ultimately lose the ability to even sign his own name. He caught a severe bout of influenza in September 1928 and died a month later. He is buried at Hampstead Cemetery in West Hampstead.|$|E
5|$|In June 1790, Harmar and Arthur St. Clair {{were ordered}} to lead another {{expedition}} against the Indians. Harmar had hoped that Scott, Isaac Shelby, or Benjamin Logan would join the campaign <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky militia, but all three declined. Scott had been elected to represent Woodford County in the Virginia General Assembly, and his legislative duty prevented his service. He believed that the Kentucky militiamen would only serve under Colonel Robert Trotter, a veteran of Logan's earlier Indian fighting campaigns. Ultimately, command of the Kentucky militiamen was given to Major John Hardin, and many militiamen refused to join the campaign, just as Scott had predicted. During the expedition, Scott's son, Merritt, who was serving as a captain in the Woodford County militia, was killed and scalped. The entire expedition was a failure, and it solidified the Kentucky militiamen's strong distrust of Harmar; most vowed never to fight alongside him again.|$|E
5|$|It was not {{uncommon}} for wealthy or powerful families to facilitate the construction of large temple complexes, usually by donating {{a portion of their}} family estate to a Buddhist sect. Often the land already contained buildings that could be re-purposed for religions use. The Fei (費) family of the town of Jinze, located just west of Shanghai, converted a mansion on their property into a Buddhist sutra-recitiation hall, and later built several other religious buildings around the hall. This spurred a boom in temple construction in the area, causing Jinze to become a major center of the White Lotus sect of Buddhism, which in turn spurred the construction of more temples <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> town to become a significant location within the Song. The nearby town of Nanxiang gained prominence shortly {{after the fall of the}} Song in large part to the construction of temples and other religious buildings, which spanned the entire Song empire.|$|E

5|$|Kinberg's wife Alice was {{a strong}} feminist, and during the 1980s {{he and his wife}} {{supported}} a number of changes to the liturgy and ritual. These included allowing women to read from the Torah <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> prayers, and changing prayers to be more gender inclusive - for example, using gender-neutral terms and pronouns for God, and adding references to the Biblical matriarchs in prayers like the Amidah, which traditionally only mentioned the Biblical patriarchs. While most congregation members approved of these changes, a minority resisted them.|$|E
5|$|On 25 February 2014, former First Prime Minister of Cambodia Norodom Ranariddh, who {{was ousted}} from FUNCINPEC in 2006, {{announced}} {{plans to return to}} politics <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> formation the Community of Royalist People's Party. The Cambodian Interior Ministry reportedly received a request from the party to be formally registered as a political party. In March 2014, Ranariddh hosted the party's official launching ceremony at the Phnom Penh Sunway Hotel, where he revealed the party logo and signed registration papers for the party. In April 2014, the CRPP's registration was officially approved by the Interior Ministry. A month later, CRPP appointed a new chief-of-cabinet Nop Sothearith, and the party also made an in-advance registration with the Interior Ministry to run for general elections scheduled to be held in 2018. In June 2014, the CRPP held a party to mark its official launch, and opened its headquarters at the Russey Keo District in Phnom Penh.|$|E

5|$|The Black Hills are in {{the southwestern}} part of South Dakota and extend into Wyoming. This range of low {{mountains}} covers 6,000sq. miles (15,500km2.) with mountains that rise from 2,000 to 4,000feet (600 to 1,200m) above their bases. The highest point in South Dakota, Black Elk Peak (formerly named Harney Peak) is 7,242ft or 2,207m above sea level {{and is in the}} Black Hills. This is the highest point in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. Other Black Hills mountains that are over 7,000ft (2,133m) in elevation include Bear Mountain, Crooks Tower, Terry Peak, and Crows Nest Peak. The Black Hills are rich in minerals such as gold, silver, copper, <b>and</b> <b>lead.</b> <b>The</b> Homestake Mine, the largest and deepest gold mine in North America, was located in the Black Hills and produced over $1billion in gold since it started operation in 1876. The mine is now a scientific laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Troops are {{classified}} as multi-male groups, with a matriline as the core group. As with most lemurs, females socially dominate males in all circumstances, including feeding priority. Dominance is enforced by lunging, chasing, cuffing, grabbing and biting. Young females do not always inherit their mother's rank and young males leave the troop between three and five years of age. Both sexes have separate dominance hierarchies; females have a distinct hierarchy while male rank is correlated with age. Each troop has one to three central, high-ranking adult males who interact with females more than other group males <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> troop procession with high-ranking females. Recently transferred males, old males or young adult males {{that have not yet}} left their natal group are often lower ranking. Staying at the periphery of the group they tend to be marginalized from group activity.|$|E
5|$|During spring {{training}} in 2005, Nathan signed a two-year deal {{that includes a}} club option for 2008. He picked up from where he left off in 2004, allowing no earned runs in 15 appearances from April 5 to May 10. He also had streaks of 13 and 12 consecutive save opportunities converted between April and July. As a result, Nathan was named the American League Player of the Week for the week of June 27. Nathan earned another All-Star appearance in 2005 for his pitching {{in the first half}} of the season. Although his record was 1–3 with a 3.57 ERA in 37 appearances, he had struck out 43 batters in 35 innings pitched, <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> AL with 23 saves in 25 opportunities. Nathan pitched in the 2005 MLB All-Star Game alongside fellow pitcher Johan Santana. Pitching the eighth inning of the game, he got Morgan Ensberg to pop out for the first out, then gave out a double to Moisés Alou. Felipe López singled, and Nathan was able to get Miguel Cabrera and Luis Castillo out, but not before Alou scored. Nathan had a brilliant second half as he went 6–1 with 18 saves in 20 chances, and posted an ERA of 1.76. He finished the season with a 7–4 record, a 2.70 ERA, 43 saves in 48 opportunities, and 94 strikeouts. Nathan also became the third pitcher in club history to post consecutive 40 save seasons. The Twins however missed the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|Helios– The former God of the Sun. Helios {{had entered}} into Ares' wager, {{choosing}} the fiery-being Cereyon, who was drowned by Kratos in the God of War comic series. Years later, in Chains of Olympus, Helios was kidnapped by the Titan Atlas {{on behalf of}} the goddess Persephone, who intended to use Helios' power to destroy the Pillar of the World, causing the destruction of Olympus. The plan was thwarted by Kratos, and Helios was rescued. When Kratos turned against the gods <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> Titans in an assault against Olympus in God of War III, Helios was injured and left for dead by the Titan Perses. Found by Kratos, Helios remained loyal to Zeus and attempted to trick Kratos, but was decapitated by the Spartan, which caused worldwide darkness and storms. The Head of Helios became a weapon for Kratos, using it to cast a blinding light and reveal hidden doorways. The character was voiced by Dwight Schultz in Chains of Olympus, and Crispin Freeman in God of War III.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, he had {{received}} worrying British intelligence reports that {{said he was in}} danger of being assassinated and his country may face a coup d'état. His tribesmen were unhappy at Habibullah's perceived subservience to the British, and his council and relatives openly spoke of their suspicions at his inactivity. Habibullah began purging his court of officials who were known to be close to Nasrullah and Amanullah. He recalled emissaries he had sent to Persia for talks with Germany and Turkey for military aid. Meanwhile, the war took {{a turn for the worse}} for the Central Powers. The Arab revolt against Turkey and the loss of Erzurum to the Russians ended the hopes of sending a Turkish division to Afghanistan. The German influence in Persia also declined rapidly, ending the hopes that Goltz Pasha could lead a Persian volunteer division into Afghanistan. The mission came to realise that the Emir deeply mistrusted them. A further attempt by British intelligence to feed false information to the mission, purportedly originating from Goltz Pasha, convinced von Hentig of the Emir's lack of trust. A last offer was made by Nasrullah in May 1916 to remove Habibullah from power <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> frontier tribes in a campaign against British India. However, von Hentig knew it would come to nothing, and the Germans left Kabul on 21 May 1916. Niedermayer instructed Wagner to stay in Herat as a liaison officer. The Indian members also stayed, persisting in their attempts at an alliance.|$|E
5|$|The 8th Parachute Battalion, {{tasked with}} {{destroying}} two bridges near Bures {{and a third}} by Troarn, was widely scattered {{with a number of}} its paratroopers landing in the operational area of 5th Parachute Brigade. When the commanding officer, Alastair Pearson, arrived at the battalion rendezvous point at 01:20, he found only thirty paratroopers and a small group of sappers with a Jeep and trailer. By 03:30, this number had increased to just over 140 paratroopers yet there were still no sign of the sappers who would be required to demolish the bridges. Pearson therefore decided to send a small force to demolish the bridges at Bures, <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> rest of the battalion to a crossroad north of Troarn where it would await more reinforcements before it attacked. The force sent to Bures discovered that the two bridges had already been demolished by a group of sappers, who had reached the bridges a few hours earlier, and so rejoined the battalion near Troarn that had now increased in numbers after another fifty men had arrived. A reconnaissance party, and a party of sappers, was sent into Troarn to ascertain the status of the bridge. These troops came under fire, from a German-occupied house near the bridge. After a brief fire-fight, the paratroopers captured a number of Germans from the 21st Panzer Division. The airborne troops then {{made their way to the}} bridge, which they discovered had been partially demolished already. Once the sappers had widened the length of the bridge demolished, using their explosives, the reconnaissance force withdrew back to the rest of the battalion at the crossroad. Having achieved its objective, the battalion then moved north and took up positions near Le Mesnail to widen the airborne bridgehead formed by the division.|$|E
