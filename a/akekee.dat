50|$|The <b>akekee</b> is {{threatened}} {{by the introduction of}} plants like the banana pōka (Passiflora tarminiana), a passionflower vine, that displace the native plants. Feral pigs and feral goats also destroy native growth. The lack of native host plants leads to the decline of the insects on which the <b>akekee</b> feeds. Avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum) and fowlpox transmitted by accidentally introduced mosquitoes continues to affect the <b>akekee,</b> limiting its populations to habitat above 1,100 meters ASL, where mosquitoes do not occur. Forest clearing {{in different parts of the}} island of Kauai has caused the loss of habitat for this and many other bird species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>akekee</b> (Loxops caeruleirostris) is a {{bird species}} in the family Fringillidae, where it {{is placed in the}} Hawaiian {{honeycreeper}} genus Loxops. It is endemic to the island of Kauai where it is found in small numbers in higher elevations. Because of their similar size, shape, and unusual bill, the <b>akekee</b> and the akepa (Loxops coccineus) were for some time classified as a single species. This was eventually changed, because of differences in their color, nesting behavior, and calls.|$|E
50|$|The <b>akekee</b> is a greenish-yellow {{bird with}} a black mask around the eye (especially {{prominent}} in the male) and a bluish bill, unlike the akepa, which is usually red, canary-yellow or orange, without black, and has a horn-colored bill. The bill-tips are crossed over, though not bent as in the distantly-related crossbills (Loxia). The <b>akekee</b> uses its bill like scissors to cut open buds in search of insects to eat. It also feeds on the nectar of some trees. This bird builds nests primarily of twigs high up in trees, while the akepa uses tree cavities as nest sites.|$|E
50|$|The <b>akekee</b> is {{currently}} {{found only in}} the Waimea Canyon State Park, Alakai Wilderness Preserve and Kōkee State Park. It has been heading toward extinction because of its lack of tolerance to alteration of its habitat, {{which is based on}} mesic and wet forests, especially ōhia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) trees.|$|E
5000|$|Metrosideros polymorpha {{forests in}} Hawaii have been invaded by myriad alien species. In the wet forests {{these include the}} {{strawberry}} guava (Psidium littorale), albizia (Falcataria moluccana), and [...] "purple plague" [...] (Miconia calvescens). In drier areas, problematic invaders include faya tree (Myrica faya) and Christmasberry (Schinus terebinthifolius). Alien grasses such as meadow ricegrass (Ehrharta stipoides) may form an understory that prevents or inhibits natural regeneration of the forests. In drier areas, M. polymorpha has to compete with silk oak (Grevillea robusta) and fountain grass (Pennisetum setaceum). More recently, a strain of Ceratocystis fimbriata has attacked the ʻōhiʻa forests of the Big Island, causing Rapid Oh'ia Death. While ōhia itself remains extremely abundant, some species that depend on it such as the <b>akekee</b> (Loxops caeruleirostris) and longhorn beetles in the genus Plagithmysus have become endangered due to shrinkage of forest areas.|$|E
