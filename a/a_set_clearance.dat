40|$|The use {{of terrain}} {{elevation}} databases in advanced guidance and navigation systems has greatly expanded. However, the limitations and accuracies of these databases {{must be considered}} and established prior to safe system flight evaluation. A simple approach to quantify reasonable flight limits is presented and evaluated for a helicopter guidance system dependent on a terrain database. The flight test evaluated involved a helicopter equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and radar altimeter, and a ground station GPS receiver which provided improved helicopter positioning. The precision navigation and radar altimeter data was acquired while flying low-altitude missions in south-central Pennsylvania. The aircraft-determined terrain elevations were compared with the terrain predicted by the Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) Level 1 terrain elevation data for the same area. The results suggest <b>a</b> safe <b>set</b> <b>clearance</b> altitude of 220 ft for flight testing of a DMA-based guidance avionic in the same area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{clearance}} {{between the}} {{punch and die}} of a fine blanking tool is an important design factor that affects the sheared surface of a product. In a fine blanking process, the clearance is typically assigned a 0. 5 % material thickness. If the clearance is too big, a fractured surface would occur in the product while if it is too small, bulging would occur. In this study, <b>a</b> <b>setting</b> for optimum <b>clearance</b> was proposed for inner corner shapes by checking shear characteristics and bulging effects according to various clearances. After designing a special part with various corner shapes possessing SPFH 590 (thickness: 4 mm), a high-strength steel material, a fine blanking tool was constructed and fine blanking experiments were conducted. The result could be usefully applied in fine blanking processes for high-strength steel automobile parts with corner shapes in the future...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} simulation testing {{of a system that}} will allow a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) to communicate autonomously with an Air Traffic Controller (ATCo). The objective is to develop a system that will enable the RPA to interact directly with an ATCo and respond in a similar manner to that of a human pilot. An existing Voice Recognition and Response (VRR) system developed by UFA Inc. was used for speech and audio conversion. A RPAS simulation was used to test the system. The results showed that the RPAS was able to interact with an ATCo in a similar manner to a conventional pilot; with the RPAS being able to follow <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of simple <b>clearances.</b> The simulation revealed a number of practical challenges, advantages and disadvantages of enabling automated RPA to ATCo communications. These are presented with discussion focussing on those issues that reduce ATCo and Remote Pilot workload, and ensure RPAS operations are in accordance with existing procedures...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a high speed annular compressor cascade for different clearance gap sizes, with stationary or rotating hub wall is investigated. Five hole probe measurements, conducted at the inlet and outlet of the cascade, are used to derive blade performance characteristics, {{in the form of}} loss and turning distributions. Characteristics are presented in the form of circumferentially mass averaged profiles, while distributions on the exit plane provide information useful to interpret the {{performance of}} the blading. Static pressure distributions {{on the surface of the}} blades as well as inside the tip clearance gap have also been measured. <b>A</b> <b>set</b> of four <b>clearance</b> gap sizes, in addition to zero clearance data for the stationary wall, gives the possibility to observe the dependence of performance characteristics on clearance size, and establish the influence of rotating the hub. Overall performance is related to features of the tip clearance flow. Increasing the clearance size is found to increase losses in the clearance region, while it affects the flow in the entire passage. Wall rotation is found to improve the performance of the cascade...|$|R
40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has {{established}} an operational {{plan for the}} future Air Traffic Management (ATM) system, in which the Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) is envisioned to evolve into digital messaging that will take on an ever increasing role in controller to pilot communications, significantly changing the way the National Airspace System (NAS) is operating. According to FAA, CPDLC represents {{the first phase of the}} transition from the current analog voice system to an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) compliant system in which digital communication becomes the alternate and perhaps primary method of routine communication. The CPDLC application is an Air Traffic Service (ATS) application in which pilots and controllers exchange messages via an addressed data link. CPDLC includes <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of <b>clearance,</b> information, and request message elements that correspond to existing phraseology employed by current Air Traffic Control (ATC) procedures. These message elements encompass altitude assignments, crossing constraints, lateral deviations, route changes and clearances, speed assignments, radio frequency assignments, and various requests for information. The pilot is provided with the capability to respond to messages, to request clearances and information, to report information, and to declare/rescind an emergency. A 'free text' capability is also provided to exchange information not conforming to defined formats. This paper presents simulated results of the aeronautical telecommunication application Controller Pilot Data Link Communications over VHF Digital Link Mode 3 (VDL Mode 3). The objective of this simulation study was to determine the impact of CPDLC traffic loads, in terms of timely message delivery and capacity of the VDL Mode 3 subnetwork. The traffic model is based on and is used for generating air/ground messages with different priorities. Communication is modeled for the en route domain of the Cleveland Center air traffic (ZOB ARTCC) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the requirements of}} a control system for active turbine tip clearance control in a generic commercial turbofan engine through design and analysis. The control objective is to articulate the shroud in the high pressure turbine section {{in order to maintain}} <b>a</b> certain <b>clearance</b> <b>set</b> point given several possible engine transient events. The system must also exhibit reasonable robustness to modeling uncertainties and reasonable noise rejection properties. Two actuators were chosen to fulfill such a requirement, both of which possess different levels of technological readiness: electrohydraulic servovalves and piezoelectric stacks. Identification of design constraints, desired actuator parameters, and actuator limitations are addressed in depth; all of which are intimately tied with the hardware and controller design process. Analytical demonstrations of the performance and robustness characteristics of the two axisymmetric LQG clearance control systems are presented. Takeoff simulation results show that both actuators are capable of maintaining the clearance within acceptable bounds and demonstrate robustness to parameter uncertainty. The present model-based control strategy was employed to demonstrate the tradeoff between performance, control effort, and robustness and to implement optimal state estimation in a noisy engine environment with intent to eliminate ad hoc methods for designing reliable control systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{drudgery}} {{involved in}} dehulling breadfruit seed by traditional methods has been highlighted {{as one of}} the major problems hindering the realization of the full potential of breadfruit as a field to food material. This paper describes a development in an African breadfruit seed dehulling machine with increased throughput of about 70 % above reported machines. The machine consists of a 20 mm diameter shaft, carrying a spiral wound around its circumference (feeder). The feeder provides the required rotational motion and turns a circular disk that rotates against a fixed disk. The two disks can be adjusted to maintain a pre-determined gap for dehulling. An inbuilt drying unit reduces the moisture content of the breadfruit for easy separation of the cotyledon from the endosperm immediately after the dehulling process. The sifting unit that separates the shell from the seed is achieved in this design with an electric fan. The machine is design to run at a speed of 250 rpm with an electric motor as the prime mover. The dehulling efficiency up to 86 % and breakage of less than 1. 3 % was obtained at <b>a</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>setting</b> of 12. 4 mm between disks. A sifting efficiency of 100 % was achieved. Based on the design diameter and clearance between the dehulling disks, the machine throughput was 216 kg/h with an electric power requirement of 1. 207 kW...|$|R
