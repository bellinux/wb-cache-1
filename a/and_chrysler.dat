5|$|Playford also {{successfully}} coaxed Chrysler {{to stay in}} Adelaide {{and expand}} its operations. The Housing Trust sold the Tonsley Park where the car manufacturing plant was set up, and helped to install railyards, electricity and water infrastructure there, as it had done at Elizabeth. By the time Playford left office, Holden <b>and</b> <b>Chrysler</b> employed around 11,000 workers, 11% of the state's manufacturing employees. After earlier failed attempts to bring a tyre factory to Adelaide, the plans to build the Port Stanvac oil refinery—which would produce hydrocarbons used in synthetic rubber—in the early 1960s were enough to convince both a Dunlop Rubber-Olympic joint venture and SA Rubber Mills (later Bridgestone Australia) to start manufacturing operations.|$|E
5|$|The Lexus LS {{marked the}} first {{successful}} entrant of a Japanese manufacturer into the prestige luxury arena, a market that had long been dominated by established European and American brands. By 1991, with the LS 400 its top-selling model, Lexus had overtaken Mercedes-Benz and BMW in overall U.S. sales, and in 2000, the marque passed Cadillac as the luxury sales leader in the largest automotive market. Rival manufacturers responded with lower prices and added features. In particular, Mercedes-Benz reorganized its operations, shifting to a targeted-cost process similar to Lexus production methods, and dropped competing U.S. base prices by nearly 10 percent. To rival the LS 400, extra features were rushed for {{the launch of the}} 1991 Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W140), causing budget overruns and costing the job of Daimler-Benz's chief engineer, Wolfgang Peter. Approximately 5 percent of 1989 LS 400 sales went to buyers employed by rival manufacturers, including GM, Ford, <b>and</b> <b>Chrysler.</b> When the LS 400 was disassembled for engineering analysis, Cadillac engineers concluded that the vehicle could not be built using existing GM methods. Industry publications noted the LS 400's precise panel gaps, and the subject became a common evaluation standard in road tests. The LS 430's interior noise level was later used by rival makes as a measure of cabin quiet.|$|E

25|$|Since 2009, GM, Ford <b>and</b> <b>Chrysler</b> {{have managed}} a {{significant}} reorganization of their benefit funds structure after a volatile stock market which followed the September 11 attacks and early 2000s recession impacted their respective U.S. pension and benefit funds (OPEB). General Motors, Ford, <b>and</b> <b>Chrysler</b> reached {{agreements with the}} United Auto Workers Union to transfer the liabilities for their respective health care and benefit funds to a 501(c)(9) Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA). Manufacturing in the state grew 6.6% from 2001 to 2006, but the high speculative price of oil became a factor for the U.S. auto industry during the economic crisis of 2008 impacting industry revenues. In 2009, GM <b>and</b> <b>Chrysler</b> emerged from Chapter 11 restructurings with financing provided {{in part by the}} U.S. and Canadian governments.

25|$|Many {{industry}} journalists, {{as well as}} {{executives at}} Ford <b>and</b> <b>Chrysler,</b> believed the Taurus {{was going to be}} a failure. Chrysler executives believed customers would instead embrace their more conventional Dodge Dynasty <b>and</b> <b>Chrysler</b> New Yorker, which were still in development at the time. Executives at Ford knew producing the Taurus was a gamble, as they ran the risk of the car being so advanced it would turn off potential customers, as was the case with the Edsel. As a result, Ford continued to produce the LTD, which the Taurus was designed to replace in 1986. If the Taurus failed, Ford would have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The Taurus, however, ended up being a resounding success, selling over a million units in its first generation alone.|$|E

50|$|Going in the {{opposite}} direction, Chrysler pushed into the luxury market by marketing the luxury 'Imperial' as a separate make and division starting in 1955. To {{make room for the}} new make, Chrysler Division began expanding downward, while Dodge Division began expanding upward, with larger and more luxurious models. Both <b>Chrysler</b> <b>and</b> Dodge began eating into DeSoto's already small market; <b>and</b> <b>Chrysler's</b> upper management did nothing to stop them.|$|R

50|$|The Packard Light Eight (series 900) was an {{automobile}} model {{produced by the}} Packard Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan only during model year 1932.
