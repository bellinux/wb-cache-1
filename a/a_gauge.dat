5|$|The {{electromagnetic}} field {{can be understood}} as <b>a</b> <b>gauge</b> field, i.e., as a field that results from requiring that <b>a</b> <b>gauge</b> symmetry holds independently at every position in spacetime. For the {{electromagnetic field}}, this gauge symmetry is the Abelian U(1) symmetry of complex numbers of absolute value 1, which reflects the ability to vary the phase of a complex field without affecting observables or real valued functions made from it, such as the energy or the Lagrangian.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, D.C., {{sustained}} winds remained below {{tropical storm}} force, though gusts reached 71mph (114km/h) as {{recorded by the}} National Academy of Science. Hurricane-force winds existed several hundred feet in the air, with wind sensors {{on the top of}} tall buildings recording winds of 70 to 85mph (115 to 135km/h). Rainfall was minimal, amounting to around two inches across the district. <b>A</b> <b>gauge</b> on Wisconsin Avenue recorded a storm surge of 11.3feet (3.4m), and <b>a</b> <b>gauge</b> on a pier in the southwest portion of the district recorded a storm surge of 10.25feet (3.1m). Both observations were records, surpassing the previous observation set by the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{includes a}} dynamical spacetime, {{so it is}} difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of <b>a</b> <b>gauge</b> symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.|$|E

5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei II, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} the gladiator Hawk, who is able to {{communicate}} with demons. The gameplay {{is similar to that of}} the first Shin Megami Tensei: the game is controlled from a first-person view, and has the player exploring dungeons and navigating outdoor areas, which are presented as 2D maps seen from a top-down perspective. In both these types of areas, the player encounters and battles against demons; <b>a</b> <b>gauge</b> on the bottom of the screen shows the likelihood of a demon encounter.|$|E
5|$|The {{gauge of}} the new line was not yet determined, {{although}} the estimates had been prepared {{on the basis that}} it would not exceed 6feet. Many of Grainger and Miller's lines had been to <b>a</b> <b>gauge</b> of 4ft6in; the Dundee and Newtyle Railway (1831) had been at 4ft6½in (1,384mm) and the Dundee and Arbroath Railway, authorised in 1836, was to be 5ft6in (1,676mm). Connections to local railways were considered important in determining the gauge, but the engineer Joseph Locke urged that conformity to the gauge of the English railways was important, and in the end this was adopted: standard gauge, 4ft8½in (1,435mm).|$|E
5|$|Both {{enemies and}} their bullets can be shot down. Defeating enemies will {{sometimes}} reveal item boxes, which can hold precious metals such as {{gold and silver}} for extra points, and bombs. Only five bombs can be held at a time, {{which can be used}} to clear the screen of enemies. Weapon upgrades may appear after defeating certain enemies. These weapons, such as shotguns and machine guns, will increase the player's firing speed or damage output. When a player's bullets hit an enemy, <b>a</b> <b>gauge</b> {{at the bottom of the}} screen will gradually fill. Once filled, the player will be awarded with a Vulcan gun, the most powerful weapon in the game which grants invincibility. The gauge will then begin to deplete and the Vulcan gun will disappear once empty.|$|E
50|$|For {{measurements}} of small strain, semiconductor strain gauges, so called piezoresistors, are often preferred over foil <b>gauges.</b> <b>A</b> semiconductor <b>gauge</b> usually has <b>a</b> larger <b>gauge</b> factor than <b>a</b> foil <b>gauge.</b> Semiconductor gauges {{tend to be}} more expensive, more sensitive to temperature changes, and are more fragile than foil gauges.|$|R
50|$|A {{transporter}} wagon, in railway terminology, is a wagon (UIC) or railroad car (US) {{designed to}} carry other railway equipment. Normally, {{it is used}} to transport equipment of <b>a</b> different rail <b>gauge.</b> In most cases, a transporter wagon is <b>a</b> narrower <b>gauge</b> wagon for transporting <b>a</b> wider <b>gauge</b> equipment, allowing freight in <b>a</b> wider <b>gauge</b> wagons to reach destinations on the narrower gauge network without the expense and time of transshipment into <b>a</b> narrower <b>gauge</b> wagons.|$|R

5|$|Combat {{takes place}} in real-time. Located {{at the bottom of}} the screen is a power bar, <b>a</b> <b>gauge</b> that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy when attacking. Swinging a weapon causes the gauge to empty and then quickly recharge, {{allowing}} that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a weapon increases its skill level to a maximum of eight, unlocking a new special attack with each level. Weapons are upgraded with Weapon Orbs, which are found in dungeons or earned by defeating certain bosses. The player takes each Orb to a blacksmith, located in most towns, who uses it to reforge one weapon.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} can use {{one type of}} weapon, in addition to magical spells. The effectiveness of spells depends on the magical ability of the character and the element of the spell {{in relation to the}} enemy. When in battle mode, attacking monsters fills <b>a</b> <b>gauge</b> that allows the player to use character-specific special attacks. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each {{character can}} increase in level to gain improved character statistics such as strength and evasion. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands—a circular menu which hovers over the controlled party member. The game is paused whenever the Ring Command menu is activated. Within the Ring, the player has nine slots for storing items; additional items can be placed into item storage, which is inaccessible in combat.|$|E
5|$|One {{special case}} of Maldacena's {{proposal}} says that N=4 super Yang–Mills theory, <b>a</b> <b>gauge</b> theory similar {{in some ways}} to quantum chromodynamics, is equivalent to string theory in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. This result helped clarify the earlier work of 't Hooft on the relationship between string theory and quantum chromodynamics, taking string theory back to its roots as a theory of nuclear physics. Maldacena's results also provided a concrete realization of the holographic principle with important implications for quantum gravity and black hole physics. By the year 2015, Maldacena's paper had become the most highly cited paper in high energy physics with over 10,000 citations. These subsequent articles have provided considerable evidence that the correspondence is correct, although so far it has not been rigorously proved.|$|E

50|$|In the toolroom, the {{distinction}} between <b>a</b> height <b>gauge</b> and <b>a</b> surface <b>gauge</b> is that <b>a</b> height <b>gauge</b> has <b>a</b> measuring head (whether vernier, fine rack and pinion with dial, or linear encoder with digital display), whereas <b>a</b> surface <b>gauge</b> has only <b>a</b> scriber point. Both are typically used on a surface plate and have a heavy base with an accurately flat, smooth underside.|$|R

5|$|Panzer Dragoon Sagas battles {{take place}} while flying on the dragon. They mix {{real-time}} and turn-based elements, with three action gauges that charge in real time. When <b>a</b> <b>gauge</b> fills, the player {{can make a}} move, such as attacking or using an item such as a shield or poison cure. Waiting for multiple gauges to charge facilitates more options, such as making multiple moves in quick succession, but this gives the enemy more opportunity to attack. The speed at which the gauges charge is governed by the dragon's agility attribute; if this {{is higher than the}} enemy's agility attribute, the player can make moves more frequently than the enemy, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes the}} role of a young hero who, {{together}} with a heroine, tries to stop the Dark Lord of Glaive from destroying the Tree of Mana. The gameplay focuses on combat with monsters or other enemies, and is seen from a top-down perspective. The player traverses the game world, which is divided into several areas, and makes their way through dungeons. While fighting monster characters, <b>a</b> <b>gauge</b> is shown on the screen filling up over time and resetting when the player gets hit or attacks; by waiting to attack until the gauge is full, the player can use a stronger attack. The player is accompanied by various non-player characters, who each have different skills the player can use, and who help them defeat enemies.|$|E

At the National Weather Service office in Tiyan, <b>a</b> <b>gauge</b> observed 100mm (3.95in) of rain. Gusty winds were also associated with Saomai's outer rainbands, with gusts peaking at a measured 105km/h (66mph) on September4.

40|$|We derive {{the decay}} rate of <b>a</b> <b>gauged</b> Q-ball into fermions, {{applying}} the leading semi-classical approximation. We find that more particles {{come out from}} the surface of <b>a</b> <b>gauged</b> Q-ball, compared to the case of a global Q-ball, due to the electric repulsion. We show that, however, the decay rate of <b>a</b> <b>gauged</b> Q-ball is bounded from above due to the Pauli blocking at the surface of the Q-ball, just {{as in the case of}} a global Q-ball. We also find that there is a further suppression due to the Coulomb potential outside the Q-ball, which we find to play the role of a potential barrier for the fermions coming from the inside the Q-ball.

5|$|Heavy {{rain and}} winds buffeted many parishes located {{east of the}} city of New Orleans. A small radius {{near the center of the}} storm had much of the extreme rainfall, and limited the flooding, which could have been {{disastrous}} if it were widespread. Grand Isle and portions of the lower Plaquemines Parish were the worst hit in Louisiana. Additionally, Grand Isle reported a wind gust of 100 mph (160 km/h) and a storm surge of 5.2 feet (1.6 m). At New Orleans International Airport, sustained winds of 28 mph (45 km/h) and gusts of 33 mph (53 km/h) were reported on July 19. <b>A</b> <b>gauge</b> reported a water level of 4.85 feet (1.5 m) in Venice. Storm tides were 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters) above normal on average. A Coast Guard helicopter had to evacuate 7 Texans who were on a yacht in the Gulf of Mexico forty miles offshore, since their radio was broken and they were therefore unaware they were sailing into the storm. After being rescued, they were treated for minor injuries at a suburban New Orleans hospital.|$|E
5|$|Since the Maxwell {{theory of}} light allows for all {{possible}} energies of electromagnetic radiation, most physicists assumed initially {{that the energy}} quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbs or emits the radiation. In 1905, Einstein {{was the first to}} propose that energy quantization was a property of electromagnetic radiation itself. Although he accepted the validity of Maxwell's theory, Einstein pointed out that many anomalous experiments could be explained if the energy of a Maxwellian light wave were localized into point-like quanta that move independently of one another, even if the wave itself is spread continuously over space. In 1909 and 1916, Einstein showed that, if Planck's law of black-body radiation is accepted, the energy quanta must also carry momentum , making them full-fledged particles. This photon momentum was observed experimentally by Arthur Compton, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1927. The pivotal question was then: how to unify Maxwell's wave theory of light with its experimentally observed particle nature? The answer to this question occupied Albert Einstein {{for the rest of his}} life, and was solved in quantum electrodynamics and its successor, the Standard Model (see Second quantization and The photon as <b>a</b> <b>gauge</b> boson, below).|$|E
