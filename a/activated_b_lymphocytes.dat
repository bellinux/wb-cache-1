40|$|LINE- 1 (abbreviated L 1) {{is a major}} {{class of}} retroelements in humans and mice. If unrestricted, retroelements {{accumulate}} in the cytoplasm and insert their DNA into the host genome, {{with the potential to}} cause autoimmune disease and cancer. Retroviruses and other retroelements are inhibited by proteins of the APOBEC family, of which activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a member. Although AID is mainly known for being a DNA mutator shaping the antibody repertoire in B lymphocytes, we found that AID also restricts de novo L 1 integrations in B- and non-B-cell lines. It does so by decreasing the protein level of open reading frame 1 (ORF 1) of both exogenous and endogenous L 1. In <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> AID deficiency increased L 1 mRNA 1. 6 -fold and murine leukemia virus (MLV) mRNA 2. 7 -fold. In cell lines and <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> AID forms cytoplasmic high-molecular-mass complexes with L 1 mRNA, which may contribute to L 1 restriction. Because AID-deficient <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> do not express ORF 1 protein, we suggest that ORF 1 protein expression is inhibited by additional restriction factors in these cells.

In contrast, resting B cells {{were unable to}} spread similarly on the NIM-R 8 -coated plates. The NIM-R 8 antibody recognized a 90, 000 MW surface glycoprotein (gp 90) present on both B and T lymphocytes. The expression of this molecule was greatly increased after polyclonal (lipopolysaccharide, anti-IgM plus IL- 4 or concanavalin A) activation. The NIM-R 8 mAb with or without IL- 2 or IL- 4 was unable to induce proliferation of splenic lymphocytes. Following the demonstration that the NIM-R 8 mAb recognizes the murine equivalent of human CD 44, the induction of spreading of <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was studied using a panel of mAb recognizing different epitopes of murine CD 44.

40|$|Classical nonhomologous DNA end-joining (C-NHEJ), {{which is}} a major DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway in {{mammalian}} cells, plays a dominant role in joining DSBs during Ig heavy chain (IgH) class switch recombination (CSR) in <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> However, in B cells deficient for one or more requisite C-NHEJ factors, such as DNA ligase 4 (Lig 4) or XRCC 4, end-joining during CSR occurs by a distinct alternative end-joining (A-EJ) pathway. A-EJ also has been implicated in joining DSBs found in oncogenic chromosomal translocations. DNA ligase 3 (Lig 3) and its cofactor XRCC 1 are widely considered to be requisite A-EJ factors, based on biochemical studies or extrachromosomal substrate end-joining studies. However, potential roles for these factors in A-EJ of endogenous chromosomal DSBs have not been tested. Here, we report that Xrcc 1 inactivation via conditional gene-targeted deletion in WT or XRCC 4 -deficient primary B cells {{does not have an}} impact on either CSR or IgH/c-myc translocations in <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Indeed, homozygous deletion of Xrcc 1 does not impair A-EJ of I-SceI–induced DSBs in XRCC 4 -deficient pro–B-cell lines. Correspondingly, substantial depletion of Lig 3 in Lig 4 -deficient primary B cells or B-cell lines does not impair A-EJ of CSR-mediated DSBs or formation of IgH/c-myc translocations. Our findings firmly demonstrate that XRCC 1 is not a requisite factor for A-EJ of chromosomal DSBs and raise the possibility that DNA ligase 1 (Lig 1) may contribute more to A-EJ than previously considered...|$|E

40|$|Innate immune {{responses}} are critical in controlling viral infections. Viral proteins and nucleic acids {{have been shown}} to be recognized by pattern recognition receptors of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, triggering downstream signaling cascades that lead to cellular activation and cytokine production. Viral DNA is sensed by TLR 9, and TLRs 3, 7, and 8 have been implicated in innate responses to RNA viruses by virtue of their ability to sense double-stranded (ds) RNA (TLR 3) or single-stranded RNA (murine TLR 7 and human TLR 8). Viral and synthetic dsRNAs have also been shown to be a potent adjuvant, promoting enhanced adaptive immune responses, and this property is also dependent on their recognition by TLR 3. It has recently been shown that mRNA that is largely single-stranded is a ligand for TLR 3. Here we have investigated the ability of single-stranded homopolymeric nucleic acids to induce innate responses by murine immune cells. We show for the first time that polyinosinic acid (poly(I)) <b>activates</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> dendritic cells, and macrophages and that these {{responses are}} dependent on the expression of both TLR 3 and the adaptor molecule, Toll/IL- 1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta (TRIF). We therefore conclude that TLR 3 is able to sense both single-stranded RNA and dsRNA...|$|R
