50|$|The Department of Labor investigation, which, {{at least}} in part {{prompted}} AOL to limit Community Leader responsibilities, caused a real problem for the company. Without unpaid volunteers, the company would have to hire employees to manage and post online content and run effective online communities previously done by Community Leaders. Leading up to and following the AOL Time Warner merger, AOL did not have the time or money to invest in building and maintaining its online community. The company's later focus on advertising as its major source of income rather than high quality bespoke online content, an intention that began earlier in 1996 when subscriber hourly rates were replaced with a single unlimited-use monthly fee, provided the company little <b>apparent</b> <b>profit</b> incentive to monetize community forums.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether {{deviations from}} a domestic spot-futures relation, as identified through mispricing series in stock index futures, spillover international boundaries. Such spillovers suggest that {{information from a}} mispricing series in one market conveys a signal of similar mispricing in another market. In the presence of arbitrage traders {{and in the absence}} of market frictions, mispricing series should be independent across international boundaries. The study employs a VAR analysis of stock index futures mispricing across three large futures markets - Australia, the UK and the USA. Using time zone differences, tests are conducted for the daily transmission of arbitrage information. The results reveal the relationship between mispricing series is bi-directional. Based on this finding, a trading strategy is employed to examine the economic significance of <b>apparent</b> <b>profits.</b> The results show that some profits are possible after transaction costs but that a long horizon, probably beyond the scope of most traders, is required to exploit the spillover information.

50|$|For example, assume company A, a {{multinational}} which produces a product in Africa and sells {{it in the}} United States, processes its produce through three subsidiary companies: X (in Africa), Y (in a tax haven, usually an offshore financial center) and Z (in the US), each of which acts under instruction from A. Company X sells its product to Company Y at an artificially low price, resulting in a low profit and a low tax for Company X in Africa. Company Y then sells the product to Company Z at an artificially high price, almost {{as high as the}} retail price at which Company Z then sells the final product in the US. As a result, Company Z also records a low profit and, therefore, a low tax. Most of the <b>apparent</b> <b>profit</b> is made by Company Y, even though it acts purely as a middleman without adding much (if any) value to the product (it is likely that the products never pass the country Y, but are shipped directly from X to Z) Because Company Y operates in a tax haven, it pays very little tax, leading to increased profits for the parent Company A. Both jurisdictions of companies X and Z are deprived of tax income, which they would have been entitled to if the product had at each stage been traded at the market rate.|$|E

Stories of financial fraud and outright looting have galvanized the public and shaken the economy. What ethical lessons can we draw from these events? Two explanations seem especially prominent. The first is a story of individuals without an adequate moral compass. Some people 2 ̆ 7 s greed and ambition were unchecked by any internal ethical constraints. For such deviants, no amount of money was enough and no level of consumption too high. One trader at Enron, for instance, reportedly paid 6250 a month for an especially desirable parking space.

The second story is of individuals who did have a sense of right and wrong, but who buckled under organizational pressure. Enron pushed its executives to devise ever more questionable schemes to keep <b>apparent</b> <b>profits</b> growing and its stock price high. Arthur Andersen auditors felt pressure to accept Enron 2 ̆ 7 s numbers in order to preserve millions in consulting fees from the company.

40|$|Provisions allow {{firms to}} defer the funds in {{times when they}} reach {{positive}} results, for the periods, in which they assume higher costs or for less economically successful periods. Similarly to allowances they are accounting items, which do not overestimate assets and revenues, and vice versa underestimate the costs and liabilities. It requires taking of all risks of loss that are known {{at the time of}} compiling of the financial statements into accounting. Reserves represent accruals in a broader sense, as they assign to the revenues generated today associated costs in order to record these revenues again in the future with the aim to eliminate the costs actually incurred. This is the way how enterprises can preclude the risks of financial distress that could arise from lack of resources needed to cover future expenses and they help to strengthen the material substance, since the creation of reserves reduces the possible distribution of the <b>apparent</b> <b>profits</b> to owners. Procedures for the creation and using of reserves are governed by Czech accounting legislation, which allows enterprises a broader application {{in the form of a}} general requirement of establishing reserves for risk and loss, while banks cannot create reserves for general banking risks and other unforeseeable risks. Differences are also among Czech and international rules on creation of reserves. In addition, there are different procedures in terms of fiscal (tax) reserves.

40|$|The paper {{shows that}} the impact of a {{call-back}} service on the financial position of the monopolists in the countries where call-back service is offered, will in many cases be positive. The explanation for this result is found by observing cost and revenue streams, and by taking note of the various elasticities and feedback effects when ever there is an increase in traffic. For carriers selling call-back minutes to service providers, it is the proportionate return rule that provides then with a major, and perhaps the main source of profit on the call-back minutes they sell. The rule provides for the transfer of incoming IDD minutes and the associated hugely profitable settlement credits, from the other competing carriers, to the carrier selling call-back minutes. In this regard, the rule is not even-handed. The higher the market share of the carrier selling call-back minutes, the less well they do under the rule, so much so that under some circumstances a carrier selling call-back minutes at an <b>apparent</b> <b>profit,</b> would actually suffer losses on those minutes. ...|$|E

40|$|A decade ago, market {{players were}} making large capital {{investments}} {{to facilitate the}} import to the United States of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from distant locations, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Russia. This was predicted on the consensus {{at the time that}} U. S. domestic supply was becoming increasingly scarce. However, innovations involving hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling subsequently let to the dramatic growth of domestic production from shale gas. In fact, domestic production growth has been so strong that the U. S. is considered a possible exporter of LNG—an unthinkable notion just a few years ago. This new consensus is fueled by the current reality—one that features abundant supplies and low prices in North America relative {{to the rest of the}} world. Importantly, the commercial aspirations of firms that seek to seize the <b>apparent</b> <b>profit</b> opportunity offered by exports run headlong into concerns that allowing exports from the U. S. will force prices up, thereby negatively impacting industrial activity and household budgets. Hence, the issue of allowing LNG exports from the U. S. has entered the political realm. Several groups—such as the U. S. Energy Information Administration, the Deloitte Center for Energy Solutions, and RBAC—have studied the impact of U. S. exports on domestic prices. These studies generally assume a particular volume of LNG exports from the U. S. when assessing the domestic price impact, but they do not allow interaction between domestic and international markets to influence the volume of trade. U. S. LNG exports will occur in a global setting, so it is an international trade issue. Thus, to separate truth from fiction one must apply the appropriate analytical framework grounded in international trade. Specifically, domestic market interactions with the market abroad will determine export volumes and therefore U. S. domestic price impacts. After introducing a basic international trade framework, the consequences of U. S. LNG exports are discussed. This paper argues that (a) the impact on U. S. domestic prices will not be large if exports are allowed, and (b) the long-term volume of exports from the U. S. will not likely be very large given expected market developments abroad. The bottom line is that certification of LNG exports will not likely produce a large domestic price impact, although the entities involved may be exposed to significant commercial risk...|$|E

40|$|Much of the {{theoretical}} basis for current monetary and financial theory rests on the economic efficiency of financial markets. Not surprisingly, considerable effort has been expended to test the efficient markets hypothesis, usually by examination of the predictability of equity returns. Unfortunately, there are two competing explanations {{of the presence of}} such predictable variation: (1) market inefficiency, and stock price 'overreaction' due to speculative 'fads' and (2) predictable changes in expected security returns associated with forecasted changes in market or individual security 'fundamentals?. These explanations can be distinguished by examining equity returns over short time intervals since there should be negligible systematic changes in the fundamental valuation of individual firms over intervals like a week in an efficient market. This study finds sharp evidence of market inefficiency in the form of systematic tendencies for current 'winners' and 'losers' in one week to experience sizeable return reversals over the subsequent week in a way that reflect <b>apparent</b> arbitrage <b>profits.</b> These measured arbitrage profits persist after corrections for the mismeasurement of security returns because of thin trading and bid-ask spreads and for plausible levels of transactions costs. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. In this {{research}} the market’s reaction to earnings announcements is investigated. The investigation {{can be divided}} into three parts: testing whether earnings announcements convey any information to the market; finding any patterns in the market’s response to the earnings announcements and testing the exploitability of patterns through the simulation of trading strategies. The three part investigation essentially focuses on two parts of the market’s reaction to earnings announcements on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) for the period 1991 to 2010. The first part focuses on the short–term market reaction around earnings announcements including the dynamics of the response and the information content of earnings announcements, the predictability of the earnings surprise and the exploitability of the predictability. We found that the magnitude of the cumulative returns for the days [0; 2] is on average positive and decreases with an increase in firm size. The average information content of earnings announcements also decreases with an increase in firm size. This therefore means information uncertainty decreases with size. The earnings surprise is on average found to be predictable for firms in the two smallest size categories and shares with relatively low liquidity. Proxies for the value effect and particularly the autocorrelation structure of unexpected earnings provide some additional information to predict future unexpected earnings. Our findings regarding the autocorrelation structure of the three–day reaction (event returns) to earnings announcements are consistent with that found by Bernard and Thomas [1]. We however found that the autocorrelation is largely restricted to small size firms. The second part of the investigation involves the longer–term reaction to earnings announcements which includes investigating the statistical significance and exploitability of the post–earnings announcement drift (PEAD). The Post–Earnings Announcement Drift anomaly has been widely researched and confirmed for several markets around the world. It is observed that contrary to previous research conducted on the JSE that confirmed the overreaction phenomenon for the period 1975 – 1989 [2], evidence suggests that for the period under investigation the PEAD effect occurred on the JSE for the period from 1991 to 2010 and it is found to be statistically significant and independent of the size, value and/or momentum effect. All these effects are however found to have a significant influence on the magnitude of the PEAD effect. The results indicate that the market reacts very quickly to the announced earnings and it is not until about the 20 th to 40 th trading day after the earnings announcement that the market starts drifting {{in the direction of the}} initial reaction. The market therefore seems not to underreact to the earnings information at first, but that it receives confirmation in the two months following the announcement that is indicative of better future prospects and that the higher than expected earnings might persist. In retrospect, when only considering earnings news, it thus seems that the market under–reacted to the information released at the earnings announcement. We however found no conclusive evidence in the trading simulation analysis to indicate that the PEAD effect can be exploited on a profitable basis. What the simulation analysis however did reveal was that the liquidity limitations imposed by the simulator lowered the overall returns achieved. It can therefore be argued that the PEAD effect is related to market frictions that prevent arbitrageurs to exploit the <b>apparent</b> <b>profit</b> opportunity. Our results tend to agree with the limited arbitrage hypothesis of Mendenhall [3] who argued that the magnitude of PEAD is related to the risk faced by arbitrageurs and Chordia et al. [4] who found that the PEAD anomaly mainly occurs for the highly illiquid shares. Master...|$|E

"Private {{industry}} {{responded to}} the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 {{with the development of}} an experimental power plant constructed under the auspices of a consortium of interested companies. It soon became <b>apparent</b> that <b>profits</b> from the private exploitation of atomic energy were uncertain and the accompanying risks substantial. Although the AEC offered incentives to encourage investment, there remained {{in the path of the}} private nuclear power industry various problems - the risk of potentially vast liability in the event of a nuclear accident of a sizable magnitude being the major obstacle. Notwithstanding comprehensive testing and study, the uniqueness of this form of energy production made it impossible totally to rule out the risk of a major nuclear accident resulting in extensive damage. Private industry and the AEC were confident that such a disaster would not occur, but the very uniqueness of nuclear power meant that the possibility remained, and the potential liability dwarfed the ability of the industry and private insurance companies to absorb the risk. Thus, while repeatedly stressing that the risk of a major nuclear accident was extremely remote, spokesmen for the private sector informed Congress that they would be forced to withdraw from the field if their liability were not limited by appropriate legislation." ...|$|R

Until 1954, the entire mintage of such issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public.
