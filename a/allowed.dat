5|$|At Super Bowl XLVIII, Thunder led {{the team}} onto the field {{at the start of}} the game, making it the first Super Bowl where he was <b>allowed</b> to do so. Thunder was also <b>allowed</b> to run in the end zone after a touchdown, but because MetLife Stadium was {{considered}} a neutral zone for both teams, he was not <b>allowed</b> to run the length of the field.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, UConn boasted one of {{the better}} {{defenses}} in the country. The Huskies <b>allowed</b> the 10th-fewest yards per game in the nation with 281yards <b>allowed.</b> Connecticut was especially good against the pass; they <b>allowed</b> an average of only 165yards per game, seventh-best in the country. No UConn opponent passed for more than 259yards during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Coursed mud {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, and <b>allowed</b> to dry. More mud is added and <b>allowed</b> to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form is filled with wetter mud and <b>allowed</b> to dry.|$|E

5|$|During this season, Maryland outscored {{its opponents}} 298–38, {{accumulated}} six shutout wins, and <b>allowed</b> only one team, Georgia, to score more than 7 points. No ACC team scored more total points until 1967 and none has ever <b>allowed</b> fewer {{points in the}} regular season (31). Maryland ranked first nationally in terms of rushing defense (83.9 yards <b>allowed</b> per game) and scoring defense (3.1 points <b>allowed</b> per game). At the end of the regular season, the three wire services, the Associated Press, International News Service, and United Press, each named Maryland as the national championship team.|$|E
5|$|Fister {{continued}} {{to play for the}} Double-A West Tenn Diamond Jaxx in 2008. On April 23, Fister was named the Southern League Pitcher of the Week. Fister became the Southern League's first 10-game loser on July 10. On the season, Fister went 6–14 with a 5.43 ERA, and 104 strikeouts in 31 games; 23 starts. Fister was first among Diamond Jaxx pitchers in losses, games started, innings pitched (134), hits <b>allowed</b> (155), runs <b>allowed</b> (95), earned runs <b>allowed</b> (81), home runs <b>allowed</b> (12); and was second in wins, bases on balls (walks) <b>allowed</b> (45), and strikeouts. He was also first in the Southern League in runs allowed; and was second in losses, and earned runs <b>allowed.</b> At the end of the 2008 regular season, Fister played in the Arizona Fall League (AFL) with the Peoria Javelinas. In the AFL, Fister was involved in no decisions with a 3.32 ERA, and 22 strikeouts in 11 games, all in relief.|$|E

50|$|Any-source {{multicast}} <b>allows</b> a {{host computer}} to map IPs and then sends IPs {{to a number}} of groups via IP address. This method of multicasting <b>allows</b> hosts to transmit to/from groups without any restriction on the location of end-user computers by <b>allowing</b> any receiving host group computer to become a transmission source. Bandwidth usage is nominal <b>allowing</b> Video Conferencing to be used extensively. However, this type of multicast is vulnerable in that it <b>allows</b> for unauthorized traffic and denial-of-service attacks.|$|R

Sitz (1990), the Supreme Court <b>allowed</b> discretionless sobriety checkpoints. In Illinois v. Lidster (2004), the Supreme Court <b>allowed</b> focused informational checkpoints.

5|$|Although it {{is unknown}} when it was opened, Loring was host to a Conventional Enhanced Release Training bomb range, which was located {{adjacent}} to the runway.

One disadvantage of the location of Loring was its distance from the Strategic Training Route Complex and bombing ranges in Nevada and Utah.
