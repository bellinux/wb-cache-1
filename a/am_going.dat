5|$|Picture {{me in this}} market-place – I spend {{nearly every}} day there for it fascinates me {{completely}} – have done 16 drawings and two oil things so far – Am feeling thoroughly at home now so <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to take out my big oil box – wanted {{to get used to}} people and things first – Oh how I do love it all!... Oh the sun is shining I must out to work.|$|E
5|$|The story I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to tell is {{a horrible}} one: I beg that daughters and fathers should hold {{themselves}} aloof, while I sing, or if they find my songs enchanting, let them refuse to believe this part of my tale, and suppose that it never happened: or else, if they believe that it did happen, they must believe also in the punishment that followed.|$|E

5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to be happy.|$|E

25|$|In {{contemporary}} spoken language, adjective {{forms are}} often not distinguished from adverbs, as in Sursilvan Jeu mon direct 'I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> directly', rather than Jeu mon directamein. This usage is rare in most other Romance languages with a few sporadic exceptions as in French parler haut or Italian vosà fort 'speak aloud', and the common usage in colloquial Romansh is likely an influence from German.|$|E

5000|$|..... Upon the {{suggestion}} of Gendarmerie Forces Commander Gen. Şener Eruygur, {{we went to the}} social facilities of the gendarmerie. (...) We decided to form an action plan on our own. We <b>were</b> first <b>going</b> {{to take control of the}} media, so I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to invite M.Ö. for that purpose. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to keep in contact with rectors and arrange for students to engage in demonstrations. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to act in unison with unions. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to get posters hung in the streets. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to contact associations and incite them against the government. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do all of this across the country, and it would be known as Sarıkız.|$|R

25|$|I wish no harm to {{any human}} being, but I, as one man, <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to {{exercise}} my freedom of speech. No human {{being on the}} face of the earth, no government is going to take from me my right to speak, my right to protest against wrong, my right to do everything that is for the benefit of mankind. I am not here, then, as the accused; I am here as the accuser of capitalism dripping with blood from head to foot.|$|E
25|$|Before I forget it, let {{me remind}} you that I shall want the trunk and the things you took away from my house as soon as possible. I learn that instead of taking old things, you took my best. Mrs. Rogers is at the White Mountains. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to Fairhaven this afternoon. I hope you will not be there. By the way, I have been using a pair of your gloves in the Mountains, and they don't seem to be much of an attraction.|$|E
25|$|In {{his final}} letter, to Blumentritt – Tomorrow at 7, I shall be shot; but I am {{innocent}} {{of the crime}} of rebellion. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to die with a tranquil conscience. Rizal {{is believed to be the}} first Filipino revolutionary whose death is attributed entirely to his work as a writer; and through dissent and civil disobedience enabled him to successfully destroy Spain's moral primacy to rule. He also bequeathed a book personally bound by him in Dapitan to his 'best and dearest friend.' When Blumentritt received it in his hometown Litoměřice (Leitmeritz) he broke down and wept.|$|E

25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of her seventh studio album Ray of Light (1998), Madonna stated in a live {{interview}} with Larry King on January 19, 1999 that [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to do a movie in April; The Next Best Thing, and then I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to rehearse to go on tour. And then I'll probably play up until the millennium, New Year's Eve." [...] The tour was delayed until 2001, as she had, in her own words, [...] "been distracted by having children and filming movies". She also began a serious relationship with Guy Ritchie in 1999. By 2000, she had become pregnant with her son Rocco Ritchie, released her eighth studio album Music that year, and married Ritchie in December 2000.|$|E
5000|$|Describing her experience, Ramírez said, [...] "I couldn’t {{stand the}} pain anymore. If my baby <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to die, then I decided I {{would have to}} die, too.

I thought that God would save both our lives." ...|$|R
50|$|On 12 November 2014, {{the design}} of the new stadium was {{revealed}} at press conference held by László Vigh and András Cser-Palkovics, mayor of Székesfehérvár.

500|$|Facing an {{ultimately}} detached nature, {{the characters}} find solace in human solidarity. They are {{often referred to}} collectively as [...] "the men", rather than singularly by their professions, creating a silent understanding between them of their togetherness. The first few sentences of section three attest to this connection: [...] "It {{would be difficult to}} describe the subtle brotherhood of men that was here established on the seas. No one said that it was so. No one mentioned it. But it dwelt in the boat, and each man felt it warm him. They were a captain, an oiler, a cook, and a correspondent, and they were friends, friends in a more curiously iron-bound degree than may be common." [...] Survival is also an important thematic element in itself, as it is contingent upon the men to battle the elements in order to save themselves. The correspondent's desire to survive is evident in his refrain of the lyrical line: [...] "If I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to be drowned—if I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to be drowned—if I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to be drowned, why, {{in the name of the}} seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees?" [...] By repeating himself, the correspondent expresses himself ritualistically, and yet he remains existentially adrift.|$|E

500|$|Despite his radical views, Haywood {{emerged from}} the trial with a {{national}} reputation. Eugene Debs called him [...] "the Lincoln of Labor." [...] Along with his colorful background and appearance, he {{was known for his}} blunt statements about capitalism. [...] "The capitalist has no heart," [...] he often said, [...] "but harpoon him in the pocketbook and you will draw blood." [...] Another time, he began a speech by noting, [...] "Tonight I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to speak on the class struggle and I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to make it so plain that even a lawyer can understand it." [...] Yet Haywood also had a flair for dangerous hyperbole that, when quoted in newspapers, was used to justify wholesale arrests of IWW strikers. [...] "Confiscate! That's good!" [...] he often said. [...] "I like that word. [...] It suggests stripping the capitalist, taking something away from him. [...] But there {{has got to be a}} good deal of force to this thing of taking." ...|$|E
