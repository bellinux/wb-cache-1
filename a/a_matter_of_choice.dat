25|$|Rush {{pioneered the}} {{therapeutic}} approach to addiction. Prior to his work, drunkenness {{was viewed as}} being sinful and <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> Rush believed that the alcoholic loses control over himself and identified the properties of alcohol, rather than the alcoholic's choice, as the causal agent. He developed the conception of alcoholism {{as a form of}} medical disease and proposed that alcoholics should be weaned from their addiction via less potent substances.|$|E
25|$|Although {{scientists}} favor biological {{models for}} the cause of sexual orientation, they do not believe that it is the result of any one factor. They generally believe that it is determined by biological and environmental factors; they state that most people's sexual orientation is determined at an early age, and sexual orientation development involves a complex interplay between nature and nurture. The biological factors are genetic and hormonal, both of which affect the fetal development of the brain, while environmental factors may be sociological, psychological, or involve the early uterine environment. Scientists generally do not believe that sexual orientation is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many outergarments like sundresses, tank tops, {{and formal}} evening wear are {{designed}} to be worn without bras. Fashion writers continue to suggest alternatives to bras or ways of dressing without bras, emphasising that wearing a bra is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> and not a requirement. Given the discomfort women experience with ill-fitting bras, an increasing number of women, once they are home, are switching to undershirts, jogbras, or nothing at all. Unhappy bra owners have donated thousands of bras to the Braball Sculpture, a collection of 18,085 bras. The organizer, Emily Duffy, wears a 42B and switched to stretch undershirts with built-in bras because standard bras cut her midsection.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{abandoned}} internal realism, Putnam still resists {{the idea that}} any given thing or system of things {{can only be described}} in exactly one complete and correct way. He thus accepts [...] "conceptual relativity" [...] – the view that it may be <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> or convention, e.g., whether mereological sums exist, or whether space-time points are individuals or mere limits. In other words, having abandoned internal realism Putnam came to accept metaphysical realism in simply the broad sense of rejecting all forms of verificationism and all talk of our 'making' the world.|$|E

2500|$|As {{pointed out}} by Lawrence B. Mohr, the early theorists of {{organizational}} structure, Taylor, Fayol, and Weber [...] "saw the importance of structure for effectiveness and efficiency and assumed without the slightest question that whatever structure was needed, people could fashion accordingly. Organizational structure was considered <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice...</b> When in the 1930s, the rebellion began {{that came to be}} known as human relations theory, there was still not a denial of the idea of structure as an artifact, but rather an advocacy of the creation of a different sort of structure, one in which the needs, knowledge, and opinions of employees might be given greater recognition." [...] However, a different view arose in the 1960s, suggesting that the organizational structure is [...] "an externally caused phenomenon, an outcome rather than an artifact." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Slave morality" [...] {{comes about}} as a {{reaction}} to master-morality. Here, value emerges from the contrast between good and evil: good being associated with other-worldliness, charity, piety, restraint, meekness, and submission; and evil seen as worldly, cruel, selfish, wealthy, and aggressive. Nietzsche sees slave morality as pessimistic and fearful, values for them serving only to ease the existence for those who suffer from the very same thing. He associates slave-morality with the Jewish and Christian traditions, in a way that slave-morality is born out of the ressentiment of slaves. Nietzsche argued that the idea of equality allowed slaves to overcome their own condition without hating themselves. And by denying the inherent inequality of people (such as success, strength, beauty or intelligence), slaves acquired a method of escape, namely by generating new values on the basis of rejecting something that was seen as a perceived source of frustration. It was used to overcome the slave's own sense of inferiority before the (better-off) masters. It does so by making out slave weakness to be <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> by, e.g., relabeling it as [...] "meekness". The [...] "good man" [...] of master morality is precisely the [...] "evil man" [...] of slave morality, while the [...] "bad man" [...] is recast as the [...] "good man".|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{expression}} [...] "curate-in-charge" [...] was mainly used of an informal arrangement whereby an incumbent gave substantial responsibility {{for one of}} the churches within the parish to an assistant, in law it denoted a cleric licensed by the bishop to exercise {{some or all of the}} cure-of-souls when the incumbent had failed to make adequate provision for them or was subject to disciplinary measures. Once in possession of their benefices, rectors and vicars enjoyed a freehold, and could only be removed after due legal process, and for a restricted number of reasons. Perpetual curates were placed on a similar footing in 1838 and were commonly styled [...] "vicars", and this practice was legally recognised in 1868. Clergy (both transitional deacons and priests) who assist the [...] "curate" [...] were, and are, properly called assistant curates, but are often referred to as [...] "the curate". A house provided for an assistant curate is sometimes colloquially called a [...] "curatage". Assistant curates are also licensed by the bishop, but only at the request of the [...] "curate", who had the right of dismissal subject to certain conditions. Although it is customary for a priest to serve as a curate in one or more parishes before becoming an incumbent, it is by no means unknown for priests who have previously been beneficed or consecrated bishop to return to a curacy (as assistant curate), sometimes as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> For example, Geoffrey Francis Fisher served as Curate of Trent near Sherborne after retiring as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1961.|$|E
