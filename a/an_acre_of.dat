5|$|A moat, {{approximately}} 190 metres (620 feet) to {{the south}} of the castle, was constructed in mediaeval times, likely {{around the time of the}} rebuilding in 1305. A Scheduled Ancient Monument in its own right, the moat encloses approximately <b>an</b> <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> land around the property. The moat may have been an enclosure surrounding farm buildings connected to the castle.|$|E
5|$|Living {{alone in}} Mysore, Narayan {{developed}} {{an interest in}} agriculture. He bought <b>an</b> <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> agricultural land and tried his hand at farming. He was also prone to walking to the market every afternoon, {{not so much for}} buying things, but to interact with the people. In a typical afternoon stroll, he would stop every few steps to greet and converse with shopkeepers and others, most likely gathering material for his next book.|$|E

5|$|On {{the death}} of Alphonso Vincent in 1932, his son George {{inherited}} the property. He lived at the site in an old lorry {{until his death in}} 1973. The mill passed to his daughter, who sold it in 1974 to Mr and Mrs Humphries, who intended to convert it into a house. They later changed their minds and offered it for sale for restoration. In 1976, the cap of the mill was blown to pieces in a gale. Thelnetham windmill was purchased by five members of the Suffolk Mills Group in November 1979, and plans for restoration were made. The consortium consisted of Mark Barnard, Charles Dolman, Peter Dolman, David Pearce and Chris Seago. The derelict mill and <b>an</b> <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> land cost £6,000.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} curriculum, {{there are no}} {{references}} to sports being played at Carre's before the 19th century. In 1835, the Marquis of Bristol allowed the school to use <b>an</b> <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> land, which probably functioned as a playground. Sports fields were not added to the grounds until 1908, but the earliest reports of the school participating in sporting events pre-date this by half a century. In the 1860s, the Sleaford Gazette reported on cricket matches with local schools, namely the rival academies run by Mr Boyer and Mr Dibben in Sleaford; by the 1890s, these matches were being organised with more distant schools, like the grammar school at Grantham. Athletics were practised at the school as early as 1871 when a sports day was held; the 100 yards and half a mile races, hurdles, the pole jump and throwing the cricket ball were activities in which forms competed. Football was played at the school as early as 1895. Glebe land was acquired in 1908 for sporting purposes and levelled in the early 1930s. A cycling club was formed in the 1940s and badminton was informally organised by pupils by the 1950s; between 1957 and 1960, a portion of land was converted into tennis courts for the school and rugby {{was introduced in the}} 1966–67 academic year.|$|E

25|$|The first European {{settlement}} of the Hudson area occurred in 1699 when settler John Barnes, who had been granted <b>an</b> <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> the Ockookangansett Indian plantation the year before, built a gristmill on the Assabet River on land that {{would one day be}} part of Hudson. By 1701, Barnes had also built a sawmill on the river and had built a bridge across it. Over the next century, Hudson grew slowly.|$|E
25|$|O'Brien saw {{its prime}} {{importance}} and during 1905 pressed and negotiated {{for what was}} to become, after the January 1906 general election, the Bryce Labourers (Ireland) Act (1906), which {{during the course of}} the next five years financed the erection of over 40,000 commodious cottage homes, each on <b>an</b> <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> land. This unique social housing programme unparalleled anywhere in Europe brought about an unprecedented agrarian revolution, changing the face of the Irish countryside.|$|E

25|$|The IPP rift with O’Brien deepened {{after he}} helped guide the Bryce 1906 Labourers (Ireland) Act through parliament, which {{provided}} large scale government {{funding for a}} programme of extensive rural social housing. In the following five years over 40,000 labourer owned cottages standing on <b>an</b> <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> land and purchases at low annual annuities, were erected by Local County Councils. The Act, and the follow-on Birrell Labourers Act of 1911, housed {{over a quarter of}} a million rural labourers and their families and thereby transformed the Irish countryside.|$|E
25|$|D. H. Morgan Manufacturing, later simply {{known as}} Morgan, was a {{manufacturer}} of roller coaster trains, custom amusement rides, roller coasters, children's rides and other amusement devices. Founded in 1983, the company was originally headquartered in Scotts Valley, California. In 1991, the company moved to La Selva Beach, California and into a new 55,000 square-foot indoor manufacturing facility that also featured <b>an</b> <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> outdoor space. That facility was later increased to 75,000 square feet. The company produced a variety of rides from 1983 until 2001, but is probably {{best known for its}} steel hyper coasters.|$|E
25|$|On 24 September 1900, the Chippenham District County School {{opened in}} Cocklebury Lane, {{now part of}} Wiltshire College (built on <b>an</b> <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> land {{purchased}} in 1896 by the County, Urban and Rural District Councils). The ceremony was attended by the Mayor and Aldermen of Chippenham. In addition to Mr Edward Newall Tuck as headmaster, the staff included three masters and one mistress; there were 99 pupils. The {{total cost of the}} project was £6,000. In addition to the buildings and playground, four acres of adjoining land were rented for playing fields. All day classes were consolidated here and pupil numbers increased rapidly.|$|E

25|$|Citrus {{in central}} Florida did well until the Great Freeze of 1894-5. Many growers {{abandoned}} their groves entirely, but Mead recognized that below ground artesian water {{at a constant}} 70 degrees might provide relief from frost and allow citrus trees to survive freezing temperatures. His engineering background led him to postulate that overhead water irrigation of the trees hanging with fruit could keep the fruit protected from damage at 32° within an ice cocoon regardless of how low the mercury fell. He successfully covered <b>an</b> <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> oranges, installed a pump and irrigation system, and proved the concept, the first known description of a technique still used today.|$|E
25|$|A former {{warehouse}} dock, Pier 2 {{opened in}} May 2014 and {{is dedicated to}} active recreation. The Pier contains over five acres of basketball, handball, bocce, and shuffleboard courts, and over half <b>an</b> <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> artificial play turf, fitness equipment, swing sets, and picnic tables available for walk-up use. A wide promenade wraps around the pier, offering views of the Manhattan skyline and New York Harbor. Restrooms, lockers, water fountains/bottle refilling stations, and bike racks are also available. The Pier and all facilities are fully ADA accessible. A warehouse roof preserved from when the pier was operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey partially covers the pier. Additionally, Brooklyn Bridge Park Boathouse operates a free summer kayaking program, which lets patrons paddle in the protected embayment.|$|E
25|$|The Kings bought <b>an</b> <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> {{land on a}} bare {{hillside}} at Warrandyte, a small {{settlement in}} the Yarra valley, about 25km north-east of Melbourne. In the early 1950s, it was a rural area, rather isolated, and lacking most of the services now taken for granted in suburban areas (such as roads, water, sewerage and electricity). The Kings asked the architect, Robin Boyd (cousin of the artist, Arthur Boyd), to design a house for them. Boyd designed a basic, one-roomed house, which could be extended in modules over time. They did much of the building work themselves. They moved into the house at Christmas, 1952. They had no electricity {{for the first six}} months and no hot-water system for three years and the house had tanks for water. They did not have a car for a couple of years. During this time, the Kings’ two daughters, Joanna and Angela, were born. King later referred to their lifestyle at this time as ‘suburban pioneering’, though such pioneering was not uncommon in the outer suburbs of Melbourne at this time.|$|E

25|$|In the 1870s {{the village}} of Killinghall, in the parish of Ripley, was {{increasing}} in size, and by 1879 had a population of 6,200 who needed a church closer than the one at Ripley. Killinghall consequently became a separate parish. The endowment for this parish came {{from the sale of}} a glebe farm at Ripley. More than <b>an</b> <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> land for the church and its approaches was donated by Dr and Mrs Beaumont of Knaresborough, and donations were given by local landowners and friends of the project. This allowed the church committee to plan a vicarage also. Beaumont later agreed to sell the adjoining two acres of land to the committee for £200, and this was earmarked for the burial ground. The committee received a grant of £1,500 from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and expected to have to raise £3,000 for a church building to accommodate 400–500 persons, and £1,500 for the vicarage. However, in return for the vicarage grant, the new vicar Reverend R.K. Smith had to pay the Commissioners £214 per annum. This sum equalled the whole of his stipend, apart from the use of the vicarage which was not yet built. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday 28–30 August 1879, a bazaar was held under the auspices of Miss Ingilby of Ripley Castle, to raise over £300 towards the cost of the church. This event was designed to attract the gentry of Harrogate, who arrived in large numbers by carriage.|$|E
25|$|In 1871 Waitetuna {{residents}} {{agreed to}} build a school, but an 1872 flood washed away the timber for the scheme. A half-time school and a private school ran for a while. Waitetuna School District was gazetted in 1873, but the Education Rate proved insufficient to pay {{the teacher and the}} school closed in 1875. A new school on donated land opened, with a teacher's residence added in 1877 and an adjacent 11 acres added by the Waste Lands Board in 1878. As early as 1882 a petition requested the school be moved away from the damp hollow, but nothing happened until the main road was diverted through the grounds in 1906. On 24 August 1903 Waitetuna School changed its name to Te Uku. In August 1908 the present school was established about 800 metres to the east, with one room on another 2 acres of donated land. Inadvertently, <b>an</b> <b>acre</b> <b>of</b> Church land was taken by the school until sold for a post office and store in 1923. A second classroom was added in 1935, a teacher's house in 1941, a concrete play area in 1948, a football paddock leased from 1951, a prefab added in 1954, a lavatory block in 1957, a school pool in 1961 and the Aramiro School building moved here in 1965. Ohautira Maori School closed in 1969, shortly after the timber mill, and in 1975 another classroom was added.|$|E
