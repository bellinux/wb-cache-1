5|$|Known in {{the circles}} of clerics, students, and merchants, chess {{entered into the}} popular culture of Middle Ages. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the 209th song of Carmina Burana from the 13thcentury, which starts {{with the names of}} chess pieces, Roch, pedites, regina...|$|E
5|$|Tungsten {{trioxide}} {{can form}} intercalation compounds with alkali metals. These {{are known as}} bronzes; <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> sodium tungsten bronze.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the bipartite double cover, {{formed from}} a graph by {{splitting}} each vertex v into v0 and v1 and replacing each edge u,v with edges u0,v1 and v0,u1. The function mapping v0 and v1 in the cover to v {{in the original}} graph is a homomorphism and a covering map.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> basic <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> {{integrally}} closed domain, i.e., {{a normal}} ring. For <b>an</b> <b>example</b> which <b>is</b> not normal, one can consider the non-integral ring , or {{the ring of}} a nodel curve.|$|R

50|$|Another {{defining}} SNP of R1b1b, M335, {{was first}} documented in 2004, when <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>was</b> discovered in Turkey, which was classified {{at that time}} as R1b4.|$|R
5|$|As La Dispute have {{promoted}} {{their music}} on headline tours {{they have tried}} to create a play different songs and create a different experience for each live show. They have also used songs after a certain period of time: <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> 'King Park', which although was initially considered too emotionally draining for live performances, the band eventually started to play the song live. The band played 'St Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues' from Wildlife at its first performance in September 2012.|$|E
5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the development of wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E
5|$|Early SEGRAs were {{synthetic}} steroids. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> RU24858, one of {{the first}} compounds of this type to be published. Many newer SEGRAs have a different framework, although the similarity to steroids can still be seen in molecules like the benzopyranoquinoline A276575 or in octahydrophenanthrene-2,7-diol derivatives. All of these compounds have been shown to exhibit SEGRA properties in cellular or in animal models.|$|E

5|$|In close {{binary star}} systems {{one of the}} stars can lose mass to a heavier companion. Accretion-powered pulsars may drive mass loss. The {{shrinking}} star can then become a planetary-mass object. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> a Jupiter-mass object orbiting the pulsar PSR J1719-1438. These shrunken white dwarfs may become a helium planet or carbon planet.|$|E
5|$|In {{several other}} locations, {{the tree is}} absent from large areas but still present in a few {{specific}} habitats. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the Bluegrass region of Kentucky, where red maple is {{not found in the}} dominant open plains, but is present along streams. Here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the Grain Belt, despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area.|$|E
5|$|International {{titles are}} awarded to composers and solvers of chess {{problems}} and to correspondence chess players (by the International Correspondence Chess Federation). National chess organizations may also award titles, usually to the advanced players {{still under the}} level needed for international titles; <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the Chess expert title used in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Josquin {{frequently}} used imitation, especially paired imitation, in writing his motets, with sections akin to fugal expositions occurring on successive {{lines of the}} text he was setting. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> his setting of Dominus regnavit (Psalm 93), for four voices; each of {{the lines of the}} psalm begins with a voice singing a new tune alone, quickly followed by entries of other three voices in imitation.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, group theory helps {{predict the}} changes in {{physical}} properties that occur when a material undergoes a phase transition, for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the monuments}} at Takalik Abaj {{are not in}} their {{original}} positions but rather have been moved and reset at a later date, therefore the dating of monuments at the site often depends upon stylistic comparisons. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> a series of four monuments found in a plaza {{in front of a}} Classic period platform, with {{at least two of the}} four (Altar12 and Monument23) dating to the Preclassic.|$|E

50|$|Some {{graphics}} {{systems can}} count horizontal blanks and change how the display is generated during this blank {{time in the}} signal; {{this is called a}} raster effect, of which <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>are</b> raster bars.|$|R
5|$|Municipalities {{can also}} adopt flags of their own. The designs {{of the city}} flags {{are similar to the}} prefectural flags: a mon on a monocolored background. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the flag of Amakusa in Kumamoto Prefecture: the city symbol is {{composed}} of the Katakana character ア (a) and surrounded by waves. This symbol is centered on a white flag, with a ratio of 2:3. Both the city emblem and the flag were adopted in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on an organism's phenotype, {{or physical}} characteristics. Phenotype {{is determined by}} an organism's genetic make-up (genotype) and {{the environment in which}} the organism lives. When different organisms in a population possess different versions of a gene for a certain trait, each of these versions is known as an allele. It is this genetic variation that underlies differences in phenotype. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the ABO blood type antigens in humans, where three alleles govern the phenotype.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} useful {{physical}} properties is the diagnostic chemical shift of the carbenic carbon atom in the 13C-NMR spectrum. Typically this peak is in the range between 200 and 300 ppm, where few other peaks appear in the 13C-NMR spectrum. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>is</b> shown on the left for a cyclic diaminocarbene which has a carbenic peak at 238 ppm.|$|E

50|$|Area {{monitoring}} is {{a common}} application of WSNs. In area monitoring, the WSN is deployed over a region where some phenomenon is to <b>be</b> monitored. <b>A</b> military <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the use of sensors detect enemy intrusion; <b>a</b> civilian <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the geo-fencing of gas or oil pipelines.|$|R
