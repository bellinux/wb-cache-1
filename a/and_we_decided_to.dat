In fact at 67, he had diabetes, some rheumatism, the odd creaky joint, a healthy {{capacity}} to whinge and the usual symptoms connected with smoking and drinking. But by now the horses were gone and the dog had died. He was eating less and drinking more. One night, he fell down the stairs. He was discovered the next morning on the floor by his housekeeper. He was rushed to the local hospital where pneumonia in one lung was treated effectively and efficiently, a fracture near his hip was repaired and he was diagnosed with brain damage.

Labels are going through tough times <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> brave it on our own." [...] Many of the songs on the album were written and performed during the band's extensive touring beginning in 2007, and the songs went through numerous transformations during this time.

La Dulzura debuted at number five on Billboards Top Latin Albums Chart.|$|E
500|$|The film stars Shiv Pandit and Dhruv Ganesh; {{the former}} {{came across the}} film's script during a casual meeting with Saria. In an {{interview}} with Daily News and Analysis, Pandit discussed the meeting between him and Saria, saying, [...] "He {{had no desire to}} cast me, [...] because he thought I do only commercial films. I had to force it out of him. But when I heard it I found it interesting <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> do it". Saria called Ganesh for the table read for the protagonist of the film, Sahil, and was greatly impressed by his approach to the character. However, Ganesh was apprehensive about playing the character, but after initial scepticism he agreed to play the role. Siddharth Menon and Rishabh J. Chaddha play supporting roles in the film. The film marked the last film role for Ganesh, as he died of tuberculosis in January 2015, while the film was in post-production. The opening credits in the film's final cut honour his memory.|$|E
500|$|Following Butler's exit, sole {{remaining}} {{original member}} Tony Iommi put Black Sabbath on hiatus, and {{began work on}} a solo album with long-time Sabbath keyboardist Geoff Nicholls. While working on new material, the original Black Sabbath line-up were offered a spot at Bob Geldof's Live Aid benefit concert; the band agreed, performing at the Philadelphia show, on 13 July 1985. The event {{marked the first time}} the original line-up appeared on stage since 1978, and also featured reunions of the Who and Led Zeppelin. Returning to his solo work, Iommi enlisted bassist Dave Spitz, drummer Eric Singer and initially intended to use multiple singers, including Rob Halford of Judas Priest, former Deep Purple and Trapeze vocalist Glenn Hughes, and former Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio. This plan didn't work as he forecasted. [...] "We were going to use different vocalists on the album, guest vocalists, but it was so difficult getting it together and getting releases from their record companies.

The singer continued to state that [...] "the industry isn't 'Parent's 'R Us and that singers [...] "have the freedom to create art". In an interview for BET, Rihanna further explain why rape {{was used as the}} vehicle to push the story forward in the video despite the lyrics not mentioning rape, saying [...] "Making that into a mini-movie or video, we needed to go back to why it happened. Obviously she's not a cold-blooded killer. It had to be something so offensive. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> hone in on a very serious matter that people are afraid to address, especially if you've been victimized in this scenario."
