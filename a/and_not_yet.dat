Harvey compiled his third consecutive century and highest Test score of 205 as Australia amassed 520 {{in the first}} innings. This put Australia {{in control of the}} Test, despite South Africa successfully chasing an unlikely target of 295. Harvey accumulated 834 Test runs at 92.66 in the series. This surpassed Bradman's aggregate of 806 runs in 1931–32 as a series record against South Africa. In ten Tests against South Africa, he had eight centuries, totalling 1494 runs at an average of 106.71.|$|E

5|$|The {{three main}} {{characteristics}} of MS are {{the formation of}} lesions in {{the central nervous system}} (also called plaques), inflammation, and the destruction of myelin sheaths of neurons. These features interact in a complex <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> fully understood manner to produce the breakdown of nerve tissue and in turn the signs and symptoms of the disease. Additionally, MS is believed to be an immune-mediated disorder that develops from an interaction of the individual's genetics and as yet unidentified environmental causes. Damage is believed to be caused, at least in part, by attack on the nervous system by a person's own immune system.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, Newfoundland was {{a largely}} rural Dominion of the British Empire with a {{population}} of 240,000, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> part of Canada. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 led the Government of Newfoundland to recruit a force for service with the British Army. Even though the island had not possessed any formal military organization since 1870, enough men soon volunteered that an entire battalion was formed, and later maintained throughout the war. The regiment trained at various locations in the United Kingdom and increased from an initial contingent of 500 men to full battalion strength of 1,000 men, before being deployed. After a period of acclimatization in Egypt, the regiment was deployed at Suvla Bay on the Gallipoli peninsula with the 29th British Division in support of the Gallipoli Campaign. With the close of the Gallipoli Campaign the regiment spent a short period recuperating before being transferred to the Western Front in March 1916.|$|E

25|$|While {{the higher}} {{taxonomy}} is fairly well understood, the lower taxonomy within the Serpula genus is somewhat confusing, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> thoroughly worked out.

25|$|After a 30-year void, when LH {{materials}} were finally demonstrated, {{it could be}} said that the designation of negative refractive index is unique to LH systems; even when compared to photonic crystals. Photonic crystals, like many other known systems, can exhibit unusual propagation behavior such as reversal of phase and group velocities. But, negative refraction does not occur in these systems, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> realistically in photonic crystals.|$|E
25|$|Settlement {{patterns}} {{as well as}} village {{plans in}} England fall into two great categories: scattered farms and homesteads in upland and woodland Britain, nucleated villages across a swathe of central England.

The Society built up a complex pyramid of patronage. In 1806, Laplace was also elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.|$|E
