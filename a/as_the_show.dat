5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> {{is based}} in the United Kingdom, this article refers to seasons as series. In the case of changes made in the American broadcast, the title it aired under in the US will be listed below the {{original}} title, while meerkat name changes will be noted in the episode summary.|$|E
5|$|Guest voices {{have come}} {{from a wide range of}} professions, {{including}} actors, athletes, authors, musicians, artists, politicians and scientists. In the show's early years most guest stars voiced original characters, but <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> has continued the number of those appearing as themselves has increased.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match Bobby Lashley, {{who made his}} WWE {{pay-per-view}} debut, faced Simon Dean. Lashley won the match in under two minutes after pinning Dean after a Dominator. Lashley forced Dean to eat 20 double cheeseburgers <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> progressed.|$|E
50|$|For Series 25, Oliver Kent {{continued}} in his ongoing role <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> Series Producer with Belinda Campbell continuing <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> Executive Producer until Episode 45. Johnathan Young, former Executive Producer of The Bill, {{took over as}} Executive Producer from the final two episodes of <b>the</b> <b>show</b> (Episodes 46-47). Mark Catley, <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> writer, continued <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> Consultant Producer.|$|R
5000|$|Carson Daly was {{announced}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> first host. Alison Haislip {{was announced}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> [...] "backstage online and social media correspondent" [...] during <b>the</b> live <b>shows.</b>|$|R
50|$|Darren McMullen, who is {{also the}} host for the adult version, was {{announced}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> first host. <b>The</b> Voice season 1 quarter-finalist Prinnie Stevens was announced <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> backstage correspondent during the Blinds.|$|R
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> progressed through tryouts, Hammerstein {{repeatedly}} revised it, obscuring Suzy's {{profession and}} the nature of Fauna's house. Pipe Dream met with poor reviews, and rapidly closed once it exhausted its advance sale. It had no national tour or London production, and has rarely been presented since. No movie version of the show was made; the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization (which licenses their works) once hoped for a film version featuring the Muppets with Fauna played by Miss Piggy.|$|E
5|$|Central to the {{structure}} and plot {{of the show is}} the use of electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the police—hence the title The Wire. Salon.com described the title {{as a metaphor for the}} viewer's experience: the wiretaps provide the police with access to a secret world, just <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> does for the viewer. Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters' need to sift through this information.|$|E
5|$|Chris hates {{being in}} the Youth Scouts and wants to quit, but is afraid to tell his father Peter. Chris is finally kicked out when he runs over the troop leader during a Soap Box Derby. Peter insists on driving Chris {{and the rest of}} the family (Peter's wife Lois, their {{daughter}} Meg and their infant Stewie) to the Youth Scout headquarters, in Manhattan, to get Chris readmitted. While they are gone, their talking dog Brian is watching Nova just <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> is interrupted to show several episodes of the sitcom One Day at a Time. He tries to change the channel, but is unable to do so (nor he can turn the TV off), losing his intelligence shortly after watching a few episodes.|$|E
50|$|The Mr. Potato Head Show was {{developed}} by Dan Clark and Doug Langdale. The puppets for the characters were created by The Chiodo Brothers. Mark Bryan Wilson served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> puppet master and William Traetta served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> assistant puppet master.|$|R

5|$|Going into {{production}} in summer 1984 – with studio recordings in September and October – the first series of As Seen On TV {{was intended for}} broadcast late that year. As a theatre tie-in, Wood arranged a short stand-up tour with the same name <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> to capitalise on her television appearances around the same time. This backfired when the BBC put back the opening broadcast to early the following year.|$|E
5|$|Jean {{was one of}} {{the writers}} and {{producers}} who worked on The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film that was released in 2007. The show's voice cast was signed on to do the film in 2001, and work then began on the script. The producers of The Simpsons were initially worried that creating a film would {{have a negative effect on}} the show, as they did not have enough crew to focus their attention on both projects. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> progressed, additional writers and animators were hired so that both the show and the film could be produced at the same time. Groening and Brooks were therefore able to invite Jean (who continued to work as show runner on the television show) to produce the film with them.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon—the head {{writer of}} The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS)—is {{preparing}} to air another episode of TGS, but is angry that her co-workers have forgotten her 40th birthday. Tracy Jordan frustrates her further by deciding to break character during the show's live broadcast in {{an homage to}} The Carol Burnett Show. TGS co-star Jenna Maroney is determined to not let Tracy upstage her and declares she will have a deliberate wardrobe malfunction and bare her breast on live television if Tracy does not stop. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> goes awry due to Tracy and Jenna's unprofessionalism, Liz is forced to cut away from their regularly scheduled programming to commercials for Dr. Leo Spaceman's new album of erotic ballads to cure erectile dysfunction and Drew Baird's public service announcement for hand-transplant surgery.|$|E
50|$|Griffin McElroy serves <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> primary {{host and}} Dungeon Master.|$|R

5|$|On 16 August {{she played}} at the Staffordshire leg of the V Festival, and the {{following}} day played the Chelmsford leg of the festival. Organizers said that Winehouse attracted the biggest crowds of the festival. Audience reaction was reported as mixed. On 6 September, she was Bestival's Saturday headliner, where her performance was described as polished—terminated by a curfew <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> running overdue, after Winehouse started an hour late—and her storming off stage.|$|E
5|$|Ratings {{continued}} to plummet, {{due to the}} continuing success of SMTV Live. In March 2001, the BBC made an unprecedented move and extended the series over the summer, like SMTV was broadcast, but announced {{it would be the}} final series. Hill was replaced by Heather Suttie <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> was moved to BBC Scotland on 21 April until 15 September 2001 when the final show aired. It was replaced by The Saturday Show, which {{continued to}} be broadcast all year round.|$|E
5|$|The Unit is an American drama {{television}} series. It began airing on CBS on March 7, 2006, in the United States, as a mid-season replacement. The {{fourth season}} began on September 28, 2008 and ended on May 10, 2009, {{which was also}} the series finale <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> was not renewed for a fifth season. A total of 69 episodes of the series aired.|$|E
5000|$|... "Pine Barrens" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> most famous episode.|$|R
5000|$|Bart Everson, {{also known}} as B, who serves <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> editor.|$|R
25|$|With {{popularity}} came {{controversy over}} <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> suitability for children. Morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse repeatedly {{complained to the}} BBC in the 1970s over what she saw <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> frightening and gory content. John Nathan-Turner produced the series during the 1980s and was heard {{to say that he}} looked forward to Whitehouse's comments, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> ratings would increase soon after she had made them.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} network {{version of}} the U.S. Millionaire and the subsequent primetime specials were hosted by Regis Philbin. When the syndicated version was being developed, the production team {{felt that it was}} not feasible for Philbin to continue hosting, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> recorded four episodes in a single day, and that the team was looking for qualities in a new host: it had to be somebody who would love the contestants and be willing to root for them. Rosie O'Donnell was initially offered a hosting position on this new edition, but declined the opportunity almost immediately. Eventually Meredith Vieira, who had previously competed in a celebrity charity event on the original network version, was named host of the new syndicated edition.|$|E
5|$|The {{season was}} {{produced}} by Touchstone Television (now ABC Studios), Bad Robot Productions and Grass Skirt Productions and was aired on the ABC Network in the U.S. The executive producers were co-creator J. J. Abrams, co-creator Damon Lindelof, Bryan Burk, Jack Bender and Carlton Cuse. The staff writers were Lindelof, Cuse, co-executive producer Steven Maeda, supervising producer Javier Grillo-Marxuach, supervising producers Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz, supervising producer Leonard Dick, supervising producer Jeph Loeb, supervising producer Craig Wright, producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and Christina M. Kim. The regular directors were Bender, producer Stephen Williams, camera operator Paul Edwards and Eric Laneuville. Lindelof and Cuse served <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> runners.|$|E
5|$|The sixteenth {{episode of}} Gundam SEED {{features}} {{a scene in}} which Kira Yamato is seen dressing after getting out of a bed where the teenage girl Flay Allster lies sleeping naked, suggesting a sexual relationship. The Japanese Commission for Better Broadcasting reported that viewers filed complaints regarding the scene <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> was aired at 6pm when children would be watching. Mainichi replied by mentioning it should have given more careful consideration to the episode before airing it. The scene was extended in one of the compilation films with John Oppliger noting it expanded the off-screen scene with three shots.|$|E

5|$|Various {{changes have}} been made to the basic set since the {{syndicated}} version's premiere in 1983. In 1996, a large video display was added center stage, which was then upgraded in 2003 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> began the transition into high-definition broadcasting. In the mid-1990s, the show began a long-standing tradition of nearly every week coming with its own unique theme. As a result, in addition to its generic design, the set also uses many alternate designs, which are unique to specific weekly sets of themed programs. The most recent set design was conceived by production designer Renee Hoss-Johnson, with later modifications by Jody Vaclav. Previous set designers included Ed Flesh and Dick Stiles.|$|E
5|$|Correspondent {{segments}} {{feature a}} rotating supporting cast, and involve the show's members travelling to different locations to file comedic reports on current news stories and conduct interviews with people {{related to the}} featured issue. Topics have varied widely; {{during the early years}} of the show they tended toward character-driven human interest stories such as Bigfoot enthusiasts. Since Stewart began hosting in 1999, the focus of the show has become more political and the field pieces have come to more closely reflect current issues and debates. Under Kilborn and the early years of Stewart, most interviewees were either unaware or not entirely aware of the comedic nature of The Daily Show. However, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> began to gain popularity—particularly following its coverage of the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections—most of the subjects now interviewed are aware of the comedic element.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Barker got his {{break with}} the satirical sketch series The Frost Report, having been {{recommended}} for the show by producer James Gilbert. The show starred David Frost, John Cleese and Barker's future comedy partner Ronnie Corbett, whom he had met in 1963 when Corbett was the barman at the Buckstone Club near the Haymarket Theatre, and the two became friends. Corbett stated in his autobiography that the two had gravitated towards each other because of their similar backgrounds; neither had attended university, {{while many of the}} other Frost Report cast and writers had. Each episode of the show, which was performed and broadcast live, was focused on a single topic and principally revolved around a continuous monologue from Frost, with sketches from Barker, Corbett and Cleese <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> went on. Barker starred alongside Cleese and Corbett in The Frost Reports best known sketch, which satirised the British class system, with Barker representing the middle class.|$|E
