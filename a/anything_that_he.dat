5|$|Concurrent {{with these}} events, Mary Margaret (Goodwin) {{continues}} {{to visit the}} amnesiac David (Joshua Dallas) at the hospital. At the same time, Kathryn (Anastasia Griffith) also continues to visit David, showing him pictures to jog his memory but later admits, although he claimed otherwise to Kathryn, to Mary Margaret that he doesn't remember <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw in the pictures. As Mary Margaret notices David becoming more attracted to her, she still feels threatened by Kathryn's presence. This prompts Mary Margaret to submit her letter of resignation as a volunteer at the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{appeared}} in other {{television and radio}} shows, including Just a Minute and, from 1992 until 1998, {{playing the role of}} GamesMaster in the television show of the same name: a character who professed to know {{everything there is to know}} about video gaming. He would issue video game challenges and answered questions on cheats and tips. The show's host, Dominik Diamond, claimed that Moore did not understand <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> said on the show, yet managed to record his contributions in single takes.|$|E
5|$|Carl (Martin Sheen's character) {{represents}} {{the working class}} in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> sees {{as a threat to}} his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings form the basis of the film's subtext. This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in Platoon. In Wall Street the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the creative destruction brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.|$|E

25|$|Setting this aside, however, opportunism was the key. Napoleon {{had been}} {{motivated}} neither by an altruistic desire {{to spread the}} benifts of freedom and enlightenment, nor by a gigantic strategic combination, nor by an overwhelming clan loyalty that made the creation of family courts the centrepiece of French foreign policy. Strategic, ideological and historical factors were present in his thinking, certainly, {{but in the last}} resort what mattered was, first, the emperor's character, and, second, the force of circumstance. Forever eager to demonstrate his prowess, impose his stamp upon affairs, and demonstrate his contempt for diplomacy, the emperor was confronted with a situation in which nothing seemed to stand between him and the stroke that was more audacious than <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had yet attempted. Never had he been more wrong.|$|E
500|$|Pratchett {{had told}} Neil Gaiman that <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had been working}} on {{at the time of his}} death should be put in the middle of a road and then {{destroyed}} by a steamroller crushing it. On 25 August 2017 Rob Wilkins, who manages the Pratchett estate, fulfilled this wish by destroying Terry Pratchett's computer hard-drive. He did this by running it over with a steamroller called [...] "Lord Jericho" [...] at the Great Dorset Steam Fair.|$|E
500|$|Historian L. G. Thomas {{recognized}} Stewart's admirable qualities, but criticized him for lacking Sifton's [...] "ruthless and forceful leadership" [...] {{and claimed}} that [...] "few provincial premiers have been more universally praised by their opponents and more unanimously deplored by their supporters." [...] Even so, he acknowledged that the decisive factor in Stewart's downfall was not <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did, but {{the decision by the}} UFA to run candidates in 1921; in Thomas's view, Sifton would have been defeated in 1917 if he had had to contend with a politicized UFA.|$|E

"They {{said that}} this god of theirs {{was in the air}} before there was heaven or earth or <b>anything</b> else, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was ab eterno (from eternity) and not made or created by anybody from <b>anything,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> alone made and created all that we have {{mentioned}} simply by his own volition because he wanted to make something so beautiful as the heaven and earth, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> made and created one man and one woman out of the earth, from whom have come and descended all the men and their generations that are in the world." ...|$|R

He’s in a place where he couldn’t care less about putting things out or about something being a product. He’s living by different standards right now with a different philosophy, so he doesn’t {{want to be a part}} of <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knows is going to end up being a product. A Mars Volta record definitely ends up being a product".|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of Divine's birth in 1945, the Milsteads were {{relatively}} wealthy and socially conservative Baptists. Later describing his upbringing, Divine would recollect: [...] "I {{was an only child}} in, I guess, your upper middle-class American family. I was probably your American spoiled brat." [...] His parents lavished almost <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted upon him, including food, and he became overweight, a condition he lived with {{for the rest of his}} life. Divine preferred to use his middle name, Glenn, to distinguish himself from his father, and was referred to as such by his parents and friends.|$|E
500|$|Crash Bandicoot is {{the title}} {{character}} and main protagonist of the Crash Bandicoot series. Introduced in the 1996 video game Crash Bandicoot, Crash is an eastern barred bandicoot who was genetically enhanced by the series' main antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex and soon escaped from Cortex's castle after a failed experiment in the [...] "Cortex Vortex". Throughout the series, Crash acts as the opposition against Cortex and his schemes for world domination. While Crash {{has a number of}} offensive maneuvers at his disposal, his most distinctive technique is one in which he spins like a tornado at high speeds and knocks away almost <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> strikes.|$|E

5000|$|Hunter {{also talked}} about some collaborations saying that the band [...] "got to work with some {{different}} producers than we used on the first one. We got to work with some other key people, namely Boi-1da." [...] On working with Boi-1da, Hunter said [...] "we got some wicked stuff out of him, considering he's a straight-up hip-hop guy. The songs we made with him don't sound like <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> done. One {{of them is a}} track we're going to try to put to rock, alternative-rock radio. The song is called 'Professional'. I'm really pumped about that." ...|$|R

500|$|The two {{met again}} in July at Fremland in Essex. Garnet told Catesby that he [...] "wished {{him to look}} what he did if he {{intended}} <b>anything.</b> <b>That</b> <b>he</b> must first look to the lawfulness of the act itself, and then he must not have so little regard of Innocents that he spare not friends and necessary persons for the Commonwealth." [...] When Catesby offered to tell the priest more, Garnet declined: [...] "I told him what charge we all had of quietness and to procure the like in others." [...] Garnet also spoke with William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, asking him [...] "if Catholics {{were able to make}} their part good by arms against the King", but Monteagle's reply was vague. [...] Author Alan Haynes suggests that Garnet may at that point have become marginalised.|$|E
500|$|Hardy himself {{admitted}} {{to his family}} that he was [...] "scared to death" [...] when he first arrived overseas, but believed that the soldiers were fed something to make them brave, which he referred to as [...] "brave pills". After a short time in the military, he claimed {{that he was not}} afraid of <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> experienced from then on. Even in the heat of battle, Hardy professed that he would get [...] "wound up" [...] at times, but never frightened. He recalled many strange experiences with food and drink, such as getting used to drinking green water from canteens and eating hardtacks, which he found to be surprisingly filling. To go with this, there was often little more than small tins of ham or chicken and occasionally coffee to drink and pudding or pie for dessert. Hardy also witnessed many of his friends get killed in action, and relied on his faith in God to get him through the toughest times.|$|E
500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the series, Crash's sole offensive maneuvers were jumping onto his enemies and a distinctive technique in which he spins around like a tornado, kicking away anyone or <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> strikes. In later games Crash can expand his range of abilities by defeating boss characters. The expanded abilities include a powerful splash, the ability to jump while in the air, the [...] "Death Tornado Spin" [...] (a variation of his spinning technique that allows him to hover through the air for a limited time), a bazooka that fires Wumpa Fruit, increased running speed, the ability to safely tip-toe on top of explosive crates, and the ability to jump at incredibly high heights. The games Crash of the Titans and [...] allow Crash to further expand his offensive abilities with new fighting moves learned from collecting a magical substance known as [...] "Mojo". In , Crash has the ability to throw TNT crates, and can use his Yo-yo to bring in enemies to spin attack.|$|E

5000|$|The band {{recorded}} a track for the Game of Thrones episode [...] "Walk of Punishment", entitled [...] "The Bear and the Maiden Fair", and released it, alongside a new track, [...] "Criminal Fingers", for Record Store Day 2013. Regarding the release, guitarist Tad Kubler stated, [...] "Steve Selvidge - our guitar player wasn’t {{in the band}} when we did the last record so we haven’t formally released <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he’s</b> played on - other than an iTunes session or something like that. Having been away for a few years, we thought {{this would be a}} great opportunity to reintroduce the newest version of the band." ...|$|R
500|$|Baradwaj Rangan, {{writing for}} The Hindu, said without a human protagonist, only a villain and a heroine, the {{audience}} is [...] "led through a story that's funny, sentimental, action-packed, romantic—there's even {{a bit of the}} occult thrown in". Also for The Hindu, Malathi Rangarajan wrote, [...] "Let's celebrate the figment of [...] imagination that has made the housefly appear as invincible as any of our muscle-flexing heroes". Karishma Upadhyay of The Telegraph called the film [...] "a winner from the first frame to the last" [...] and praised Rajamouli's screenplay, writing that it made [...] "the absurd seem real, willing you to accept <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> throws at you". J. Hurtado of Twitch Film called Eega the [...] "best, most insane, most inventive film of the year", and praised Rajamouli's scripting, the visual effects and Sudeep's performance, calling the latter [...] "legitimately hilarious". V. S. Rajapur, Indo-Asian News Service gave Eega four stars out of five, and praised the performances and music; Rajapur was particularly appreciative of the visual effects, saying the hard work put in by the entire team was [...] "clearly visible onscreen". A reviewer from Sify called Eega an [...] "escapist, comic book-like fantasy" [...] that [...] "throws you into an experience so profound that nothing else really matters".|$|E
2500|$|The band {{recorded}} their backing tracks without Rollins, who overdubbed vocals with {{band members}} Greg Ginn (guitar) and Chuck Dukowski (bass) coaching him afterward. The most complicated vocal tracks {{ended up being}} Dukowski's [...] "What I See", {{which was supposed to}} have an improvised speech in the song's bridge but ended up having one written out by Dukowski when Rollins could not come up with <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was satisfied with, and [...] "T.V. Party", which featured backing vocals from the entire band.|$|E
2500|$|King hired Lawrence Christensen as {{supply chain}} {{director}} in 2004. Previously {{he was an}} expert in logistics at Safeway, but left following its takeover by Morrisons. Immediate supply chain improvements included the reactivation of two distribution centres. At {{the time of the}} business review on 19 October 2004, referring to the availability problems, Justin King said [...] "Lawrence hadn't seen <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hadn't seen before. He just hadn't seen them all in the same place at the same time".|$|E
60|$|Alured {{was well}} again, but inert and crushed, and heartless about doing <b>anything,</b> except <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{walked over to}} Spinney Lawn, and brought home Trevor's dog, to which he gave himself up all day, and insisted on having it in his room at night.|$|R
60|$|I {{took the}} liberty once, in our freedoms, {{to tell him}} he was too bountiful, and that I was too {{chargeable}} to him for a mistress, and that I would be his faithful servant at less expense to him; and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> not only left me no room to ask him for <b>anything,</b> but <b>that</b> <b>he</b> supplied me with such a profusion of good things that I could scarce wear them, or use them, unless I kept a great equipage, which, he knew, was no way convenient for him or for me. He smiled, and took me in his arms, and told me he was resolved, while I was his, I should never be able to ask him for <b>anything,</b> but <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be daily asking new favours of me.|$|R

2500|$|He held Quintanilla in {{especially}} low regard: [...] "Quintanilla's {{method was}} simple: disregard {{any evidence that}} was counter to his hypothesis." [...] Hynek wrote that during Air Force Major Hector Quintanilla's tenure as Blue Book's director, “the flag of the utter nonsense school was flying at its highest on the mast.” Hynek reported that Sergeant David Moody, one of Quintanilla's subordinates, “epitomized the conviction-before-trial method. <b>Anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> didn't understand or didn't like was immediately put into the psychological category, which meant ‘crackpot'.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{campaign}} of 1761 {{was almost as}} abortive as the {{campaign of}} 1760. Frederick acted on the defensive with consummate skill, and the capture of the Prussian fortress of Kolberg on Christmas Day 1761, by Rumyantsev, was the sole Russian success. Frederick, however, was now at the last gasp. On 6 January 1762 he wrote to Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein, [...] "We ought now to think of preserving for my nephew, by way of negotiation, whatever fragments of my territory we can save from the avidity of my enemies," [...] which means, if words mean <b>anything,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was resolved to seek a soldier's death on the first opportunity. A fortnight later he wrote to Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, [...] "The sky begins to clear. Courage, my dear fellow. I have received the news of a great event." [...] The great event which snatched him from destruction was {{the death of the}} Russian empress (5 January 1762 (N.S.)).|$|E
