40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the change}} in faustmannian age considering the social benefits due to carbon sequestration under the Regulation 2080 / 92, the subsidies provided by the afforestation program and investigates, from the social point of view, the profitability of <b>afforesting</b> agricultural <b>land.</b> The analysis refers to Calabria, a region situated {{in the south of}} Italy. Representative species are chosen for this study. The optimal harvesting age excluding social benefits varies between 32 and 40 years according to the species considered. When including social benefits, optimal harvesting age increases for a carbon price of 20 Euro/t to 34 - 44 years and is close to the one excluding them. The inclusion of subsidies to encourage afforestation shortens the optimal harvesting age to 17 - 20 years from the forest owner's point of view. Interestingly the provision of subsidies contributes to a substantial increase in social loss due to the differences in optimal harvesting ages: starting from zero C price the loss vary between 65 and 165 Euro/ha according to the species used and increases with rising carbon prices up to 200 - 400 Euro/ha for carbon price of 100 Euro/t. Furthermore, results suggest that from the social point of view the profitability of <b>afforesting</b> agricultural <b>land</b> in the study region very much depends on the price of carbon, on the type of agricultural <b>land</b> <b>afforested</b> and on the species used.

On its journey south it is joined by Reoch Burn as it passes through Carseriggan Moor. Continuing its journey it passes Isle-na-Gower and becomes a border between the <b>afforested</b> <b>land</b> at Hopeless Howe and the Ring of Barfad. Shortly after this it is met and joined by Black Burn. At this point the river is bordered on its east side by Barnley Plantation. Crossing the river at the {{stepping}} stones is a single-track road which links Mark of Shennanton with Little Eldrig. Shortly after this point the river widens briefly at Broad Wheel. Continuing on its journey southwards it is next forded by Shennanton Bridge where the A75 crosses it. Next we come to Linn Wood and the waterfall at Linn of Barhoise. The river then moves on past Barhoise Farm to Barhoise Mill. In 1684 according to Symson, this area had a salmon fishery with nets on both the Bladnoch and the Tarff. At the Mill of Barhoise, the Laird of Craichlaw had fishing rights. Barhoise Mill is a T-shaped two storey construction of granite, whinstone and slate, which is falling into a dilapidated state. The mill was driven by a wheel which was situated {{at the side of}} the building. Of this wheel only the wooden axle remains. The datestone above the door reads 1827, but this mill is most certainly a reconstruction of a much earlier one, perhaps connected with the Old Place of Glaisnick, a one-time nearby residence of the powerful Gordon family of Craichlaw. The main road from Kirkcowan to Wigtown and from Kirkcowan to Minnigaff via Glaisnick crossed the river just south of this mill. There are still stepping stones at the fording place east of Ring Farm.|$|E

The carbon sink was quantified, and the effects of the main species were assessed. The carbon sink increased from 2. 26 × 106 kg in 1999 to 8. 32 × 106 kg in 2010 with the sustainable growth of the converted areas. The black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) soil increased SOC content in the top soil (0 - 100 cm) in the initial 7 -yr period, while the sequestration occurred later (> 7 yr) in the 100 - 120 cm layer after the "Grain-for-Green" project was implemented.

Substantial financial incentives are available to encourage landowners, especially farmers, to plant. To achieve the desired scale of timber production, the plan assumes that grant-funded forests will be managed and harvested in a similar way to State forests. This study set out to determine the objectives of private forest owners for their forests and to establish whether they planned to thin their stands. It also looked at the factors influencing a private forest owner's decision to harvest and the role that extension plays in this process. A survey of 120 private forest owners who had <b>afforested</b> <b>land</b> since 1980 was conducted in 2007. The study found that while most forest owners hoped to produce timber from their woods many of them either planned to use the timber themselves or were unsure as to whether they would put it on the market.

30|$|Herders {{reported}} that the decline of some shrub species in the lowlands is due to an increased density of landless herders in fewer grazing areas following their eviction from closed <b>afforested</b> <b>land.</b> The availability of Salix tetrasperma is declining because it is harvested by landowners to supply the wood industry for furniture and sport items. Quercus incana and Quercus dilatata are mainly harvested by local communities for fuel and is also less available. Other species such as Corylus avellana and Aesculus indica are disappearing {{as a result of}} crop extension on upland slopes. These trees usually grow in areas with deep soil and high moisture, contribute to soil retention, but are disliked because of their shade cover, which exclude any other form of cropping beneath. Obviously, such good quality land is preferred for extending crop fields. Similarly, Celtis caucasica, Acacia nilotica, Ficus sarmentosa, Debregeasia salicifolia and Artemisia maritima are decreasing because of the utility of these species as fuel by landowner groups, particularly if found in the vicinity of settlements. The growing cover by Ailanthus chinensis is due to high pollination and germination ability, whereas Grewia oppositifolia is planted at an increasing rate by landowner farmers on the field boundaries for fodder. The population of Dodonaea viscosa remains stable, despite extensive harvesting for its use as fuel in tobacco processing and for household fuel, since it has a high pollination and reproducibility.|$|E

The results indicated that land leasing {{will continue to increase}} in the future, but if the landowner mandate to co-finance costly land improvements is increased, landowners are predicted to respond significantly to these mandates and search for other land management options. Three heterogeneous landowner groups were identified based on their land use choices.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{carbon leakage}} due to reduced emissions from deforestation (RED). We find that leakage with RED is good because the policy induces afforestation {{that contributes to}} a further carbon sequestration. By ignoring the domestic component of carbon leakage, the literature can either overestimate or underestimate leakage, depending on the magnitudes of the numerator and the denominator of the leakage formulas. Unlike the literature, we include the land and agricultural markets {{in the analysis of}} carbon leakage with forestation policies. In this model, carbon leakage depends on: (1) supply and demand elasticities of timber production and consumption, respectively in the country introducing a RED policy (Home country) and {{in the rest of the}} world; (2) Home country’s production and consumption share in the world timber production and consumption, respectively; (3) prices of land and crop products in the Home country and the rest of the world; (4) initial allocation of land between forestry and agriculture; (5) share of total forest area set aside under RED; and (6) relative carbon sequestration potential of the forest planted on an <b>afforested</b> <b>land</b> and of the forest withdrawn from timber harvest. These potentials depend heavily on the forest species as well as on timing of the policy, and on the discount rate and time path of increasing carbon prices. carbon leakage, forestry, reduced emissions from deforestation, afforestation, Agricultural and Food Policy, Environmental Economics and Policy, Land Economics/Use, Q 23, Q 24, Q 54,...|$|E

Abstract I use {{simulations}} from the Land Use in Rural New Zealand model to consider mitigation for different classes of sheep-beef farms under climate policy.

Farmers in intensive farm classes tend to bear the costs of emissions because their opportunity cost of exiting pastoral agriculture is high. The dominant land-use response in more extensive systems is land abandonment or afforestation, depending on location. Less profitable farm classes generally face higher average liabilities in relation to profits, both before and after the land-use response.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{multiple}} objective, decision-making model {{that focuses on}} forest policies that simultaneously achieve carbon uptake and maintenance of ecosystem diversity objectives. Two forest carbon measures are used – a nominal (undiscounted) net carbon uptake {{as a proxy for}} long-term carbon sequestration and discounted net carbon uptake that captures the “fast” carbon accumulation aspect. Ecosystem diversity is expressed in terms of desired structures for forest and <b>afforested</b> agricultural <b>land.</b> Economic effects of possible strategies are examined by comparing attainment of these objectives with the net discounted returns from commercial timber harvests and agricultural activities. The tradeoffs between timber and non-timber objectives are obtained by means of compromise programming. Two measures of distance between the current objective values and the ideal ones are used to assess attainment of multiple goals. We explore how the choice of a measure affects the decisions and overall performance.

The objective was to determine the best aspect on the tree, number of needle age classes, and number of trees that would best predict top height in these plantations at age 20. Needles were sampled from thirty subplots representative of the geographical and productivity range of this species. On the fifth whorl of each sample tree, random groups of 10 fascicles were collected from various trees, aspects, and age classes and measured for average needle length. Total height, height to the first and sixth whorls above breast height and diameter at breast height were measured on each sample tree. Weighted simple linear regression models quantified the relationship between needle length and top height of the stand at 20 years, with top height specified as the mean height of four possible stand components. Mean needle lengths were computed as plot-level means for each age class-aspect combination as well as plot-level means for 2 - to 5 -consecutive years by aspect. To assess for the necessity of sampling from a fixed aspect, the null hypothesis of no differences between aspects was tested on a plantation-, plot-, and tree-level. Only the current year's needle lengths had a significant difference in needle lengths (NL) between NW and SE aspects. The stand component representing the 100 -most dominant stems per hectare by diameter was selected for the final model because on average this dimension was more reliably predicted. Because precipitation is thought to have an effect on needle length, and because precipitation fluctuates widely between years, it is advisable to measure as many age classes of needles as possible to obtain accurate estimates of potential site productivity...|$|E

Compensation values for silvicultural regimes involving rotation lengths greater than economically optimal were computed using the Faustmann formula. Mean values obtained were US$ 8. 16 (MgCO 2 -e) -Â  1 and US$ 7. 19 (MgCO 2 -e) -Â  1 for average and high site indexes, respectively. Results show that carbon supply is more cost-efficient in highly productive sites.

The estimated value of the tonne of carbon defines minimum values {{to be paid to}} forest owners, in order to induce a change in silvicultural management regimes.

For both sites, price elasticity of supply was found to be inelastic and increased as rotation length moved further away from economically optimal: 0. 24 and 0. 27 for age 11 Â years in average- and high-productivity sites, respectively. This would be due to biomass production potential as a limiting factor; beyond a certain threshold value, an increase in price does not sustain a proportional change in carbon storage supply.

This paper presents a modelling study with a dual objective. Firstly, the biogeochemical Daycent model was evaluated to predict soil N 2 O emissions in different land uses in a typical Mediterranean agroecosystem. Secondly, the study aimed to determine the impact of climate change on soil N 2 O emissions in different Mediterranean land uses over an 85 -year period. Soil N 2 O emissions were measured in three land uses (cropland, abandoned land and <b>afforested</b> <b>land)</b> over 18 months (December 2011 to June 2013) in a characteristic Mediterranean site in Spain. For climate change simulations, Daycent was run with and without atmospheric CO 2 enrichment using climate data from the CGCM 2 -A 2 model. The cumulative N 2 O emissions predicted by the Daycent model agreed well with the observed values. The lack of fit (LOFIT) and the relative error (E) statistics determined that the model error was not greater than the error in the measurements and that the bias in the simulation values was lower than the 95 % confidence interval of the measurements. For the different land uses and climate scenarios, annual cumulative N 2 O emissions ranged from 126 to 642 g N 2 O-N/ha/yr. Over the simulated 85 -year period, climate change decreased soil N 2 O emissions in all three land uses. At the same time, under climate change, water filled pore space (WFPS) values decreased between 4 % and 15 % depending on the land use and climate change scenario considered. This study demonstrated {{the ability of the}} Daycent model to simulate soil N 2 O emissions in different land uses.

The ability of the models to simulate the long-term trends of metal fate was assessed by comparing model results and observations of either the present metal status, using hind cast simulations with historical deposition trends, or metal pools in chronosequences of <b>afforested</b> agricultural <b>land</b> of different stand age, or metal concentrations observed in a long-term monitoring study. The model simulations show the long times needed to approach equilibrium concentrations of metals due {{to changes in the}} atmospheric deposition of metals, sulphur and nitrogen. Dynamic models are therefore indispensable tools for the assessment of metal concentrations at changing levels of metal inputs to soil-water system...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} quality of wood from two {{distinct}} sites in the Czech Republic—from former <b>afforested</b> agricultural <b>land</b> and forest land. We compared the properties of Norway spruce wood (Picea abies Karst.) and Scots pine wood (Pinus sylvestris L.), the most important domestic tree species, to Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco), a North American tree species and a potential substitute for the domestic spruce. Wood density, modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR) and impact bending strength were the properties tested that were used for comparing tree species. Without taking into consideration the site, the highest density values from the tested tree species were obtained for Douglas fir (0. 568 g·cm− 3), followed by the pine (0. 508 g·cm− 3) and the spruce (0. 463 g·cm− 3). The Douglas fir also dominated in the remaining assessed properties, whilst the influence of site was not confirmed, {{with the exception of}} MOE and MOR, and only for the Douglas fir wood, wherein higher values were obtained for forest land. In terms assessed Douglas fir properties, it exceeds the domestic softwoods and represents a possible suitable replacement for them. The site only plays a role in terms of the Douglas fir, and only for certain properties...|$|R
40|$|This article {{identifies}} {{drivers of}} forest transition in a province of Northern Vietnam between 1993 and 2000 by applying geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis to remotely sensed and statistical data. The regression model highlighted the spatial {{variation of the}} relationship between the percentage of <b>land</b> <b>afforested</b> and its proximate causes Factors identified as having a major impact on afforestation are: the presence or proximity of a wood-processing industry, the distance to highways, and land allocation to households. Whereas the two former variables are in most areas of the province positively correlated with afforestation, an unexpected negative correlation was observed for the latter The analysis of these results, supported by an in-depth knowledge of the area and of the political context, leads to the conclusion that. during the time period considered. afforestation was largely driven by state organisations on protected state-owned land, and forestry was not a significant component of household economic activities (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
