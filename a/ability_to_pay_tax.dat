40|$|The South African primary rebate {{is governed}} by Section 6 of the Income Tax Act (58 of 1962). This primary tax rebate entitles taxpayers to a tax-free income portion {{up to a certain}} level {{depending}} on the rebate amount (also referred to as the tax threshold). The concept of tax thresholds in a tax system in essence adhere to the first tax canon of Smith (1776 : 676), which suggests that individuals should pay taxes in proportion to each person’s <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>tax.</b> The implication of this tax canon is that individuals who have a limited or no <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>tax</b> should only be subject to pay tax in relation to their ability. Therefore, before tax can be levied, an amount for the necessities-of-life must be deducted from the taxpayer’s income (Vivian, 2006 : 85). The primary rebate system thus gives individuals a tax-free income portion which is supposed to first compensate for an individual’s necessities-of-life expenses or put differently the costs to survive. The main {{purpose of the present study}} is to critically analyse and compare the fairness of the primary rebates in South Africa in relation to other countries. To meet the main purpose a comparison was done between South Africa’s primary rebate and related government grant programs to that of Brazil and Australia. It was found that South Africa rebate system creates significant vertical and horizontal unfairness and that it compares poorly to the fairer multiple rebate and government grant systems of Brazil and Australia. Accordingly it was recommended that the unified primary rebate system of South Africa is reviewed and brought in line with the multiple rebate systems implemented in countries such as Brazil and Australia.

40|$|Like in all {{countries}} in transition, the tax {{as well as}} the transfer system have been under serious reform pressures. The socialistic systems were not able to fulfill the necessary functions in providing a certain degree of redistribution and social security, which are inevitable for social oriented market economies. Increasing income and wage differentiation {{is one of the most}} important prerequisites for a market oriented <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>tax</b> system. But in the transformation period, numerous quasi-legal or even illegal property transactions have taken place, thus leading to wealth concentrations on the one hand while as consequence of the bankruptcy of socialism, enormous poverty problems have arisen on the other. For the political acceptance of the transformation process it is of utmost importance that an efficient and fair tax system is implemented and social security is organised by the state on a level which secures at least the physical minimum of subsistence or – if economically possible – even a social-cultural minimum. Whether the state should go further in providing compulsory social insurance systems has been a hotly debated topic for decades even in the welfare and social states of the Western type. Whereas the basic security systems have to be financed by general tax revenue, for a compulsory social insurance system – due to the insurance character – special earmarked social security contribution are held necessary. Both public goods and services as well as at least basic security have to be financed by total tax revenue. For the acceptance and fairness of the whole system the total redistributive effect of both sides of the budget – the tax system {{as well as the}} expenditure system – are decisive. In this paper we will concentrate on the revenue side, e. g. on the taxes as well as on the social security contributions. Adam Smith had already formulated some very simple tax norms which have been transformed in modern tax theory. The equivalence as well as the ability-topay principle are basic yardsticks for every tax system in a democratic oriented market system, not to forget tax fairness. In the historical development process equity-oriented measures have often produced an enormous complexity of the single taxes as well as of the whole tax system. Therefore, reconsidering the Smithian principles of simplicity and of minimum compliance costs for the tax payer would even press many Western European tax systems to undergo serious reform processes which often are delayed because of intense interest group influence. Hence, a modern tax system is a simple one which consists only of a few single taxes which are easy to administer. Such a system consists of two main taxes, the income and the value added tax. Consequently in {{all countries}} of transition both taxes have been implemented, while the implementation was fostered by the fact that both also constitute the typical components of the EU member states systems. Therefore such a harmonising tax reform is the most important prerequisite to become a membership candidate. Bulgaria also tried to follow this general pattern in reforming the income tax system starting in 1992 and replacing the old socialistic turnover tax and excise duty system by the value added tax (VAT) in 1994. Especially with regard to the income tax system the demand for simplicity has not been met yet. Complex rules to define the tax base as well as a steeply progressive tax schedule have led to behavioral adaptations which are even strengthened by the effects of a high social contribution burden which is predominantly laid on the employers. In the following some concise descriptions of the tax and social contribution system are given; the paper closes with a summary, in which the impacts of the system are evaluated and some political recommendations for further reforms are presented. ...|$|E

40|$|Although {{their meaning}} and {{contours}} {{have long been}} controversial, the general criteria for evaluating changes in tax law enjoy both stability and consensus. At least since Adam Smith, there has been virtually universal agreement that the nation 2 ̆ 7 s tax law should be fair, economically efficient, and simple to comply with and to administer. Tax law changes should be designed to make the law more equitable, easier to comply with, more conducive to economic growth, {{and less likely to}} interfere with private economic decisionmaking. Precisely what these criteria imply for policymaking is controversial, however. Fairness is often said to require that people with equal <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>pay</b> equal amounts of tax, and those with greater <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> pay more. Disputes have long raged over the traits relevant to evaluate whether people 2 ̆ 7 s circumstances are appropriately similar to warrant similar tax treatment and over the standards for evaluating peoples 2 ̆ 7 relative <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes.</b> Nonetheless, a 2 ̆ 2 fair 2 ̆ 2 distribution of the tax burden among people at different levels of income has long been regarded as a necessary attribute of a just tax system, and its assessment is essential to evaluate how a nation 2 ̆ 7 s tax law—or proposed changes in it—measure up. Likewise, answers to questions regarding the economic effects of proposed or enacted tax legislation are routinely disputed. Even the need to finance budget expenditures with revenues—a seemingly straightforward imperative—proves controversial in its execution. The pursuit of simplicity is frequently a bystander. Conflict among these concerns is inevitable—conflict that demands, and is reflected in, inevitable political compromise. Tradeoffs among these goals are the stuff from which tax legislation is made...|$|R

In colonial Kenya, direct taxation of Africans began in 1901.

This system was, however, replaced in 1928 by a hut and poll tax in which each man aged 16 and over was required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a prescribed <b>tax</b> in cash annually. To meet this requirement, Borana had begun to trade livestock {{between the north and}} central Kenya by the 1930 s (Colonial Report 1930). 79 However, the codification of males aged 16 and over is telling of the gender designation of men as heads of households who had <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> and not women. It has often been argued {{that in the case of}} northern Kenya and pastoralists, the tax policies encouraged trade in livestock, introducing the cash economy in the north.

40|$|Inspired by Ruth Mason’s recent article, Citizenship Taxation, which {{reaches a}} general {{conclusion}} against citizenship taxation, this Article also questions citizen taxation {{under the same}} normative framework, but with a particular focus on efficiency and administrability, and takes a much less critical stance towards the merits of citizenship taxation. First, neither citizenship taxation nor residence-based taxation can completely account for the differences between residents’ and nonresidents’ <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> under the fairness argument. Second, the efficiency argument, that citizenship taxation may distort both Americans’ and non-Americans’ citizenship decisions, is not convincing. The American citizenship renunciation rate is not particularly serious compared to other countries, and it is U. S. immigration law, not U. S. tax law, that should be blamed for obstructing highly skilled and educated immigrants. Third, despite enforcement difficulties abroad under the administrative argument, determining residence by considering all facts and circumstances in residence-based taxation would be worse than the bright-line citizenship criterion in citizenship taxation. After discussing the competing normative arguments on citizenship taxation, this Article aims to defend the administrability of citizenship taxation in conjunction with new reporting obligations. Individual taxpayers’ obligations to file Foreign Bank Account Reports (FBAR) or report under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) are not seriously onerous. The fact that citizenship taxation along with FBAR and FATCA enhances global transparency further supports the case for citizenship taxation...|$|R

Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates originally suggested that the exclusion of forgiven mortgage debt from taxable income may result in about $ 968 million in federal revenue losses from fiscal year (FY) 2008 through FY 2013 and more recent estimates suggest that the revenue losses could be closer to $ 1. 9 billion. The Department of Treasury estimates suggest that the exclusion may result in federal revenue losses of about $ 1. 4 billion from FY 2008 through FY 2013.
