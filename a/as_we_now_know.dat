The Roman philosopher and atomist Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BC) explicated these ideas in his poem De rerum natura (On the Nature of Things). In the Epicurean system, {{it was assumed that}} many living forms had been spontaneously generated from Gaia in the past, but that only the most functional forms had survived to have offspring. The Epicureans did not anticipate the full theory of evolution <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>know</b> it, but seem to have postulated separate abiogenetic events for each species.|$|E

25|$|Planetary nebulae are {{generally}} faint objects, and none are {{visible to the}} naked eye. The first planetary nebula discovered was the Dumbbell Nebula in the constellation of Vulpecula, observed by Charles Messier in 1764 and listed as M27 in his catalogue of nebulous objects. To early observers with low-resolution telescopes, M27 and subsequently discovered planetary nebulae somewhat resembled the gas giants, and William Herschel, discoverer of Uranus, eventually coined the term 'planetary nebula' for them, although, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>know,</b> they are very different from planets.|$|E
2500|$|... 3C 273 is a quasar {{located in}} the {{constellation}} of Virgo. It is the optically brightest quasar in our sky {{and was the first}} object to be identified <b>as</b> what <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>know</b> quasars to be — extremely luminous objects at cosmological distances.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of 3C 273, several other radio sources had been associated with optical counterparts, the first being 3C 48. Also, many active galaxies had been misidentified as variable stars, including the famous BL Lac, W Com, and AU CVn. However, it wasn't understood what these objects were, since their spectra were unlike those of any known stars. Its spectrum did not resemble that of any normal stars with typical stellar elements. 3C 273 was the first object to be identified <b>as</b> what <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>know</b> quasars to be [...] - [...] extremely luminous objects at cosmological distances.|$|R

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>know,</b> {{the fixed}} stars are not fixed. Those that {{reside in the}} Milky Way turn with the galaxy, exhibiting proper motions. Those that are outside our galaxy (such as nebulae once mistaken to be stars) {{participate}} in their own motion as well, partly due to expansion of the universe, and partly due to peculiar velocities. The Andromeda galaxy is on collision course with the Milky Way at a speed of 117km/s. The concept of inertial frames of reference is no longer tied to either the fixed stars or to absolute space. Rather, the identification of an inertial frame {{is based upon the}} simplicity of the laws of physics in the frame. In particular, the absence of fictitious forces is their identifying property.|$|E
25|$|The British central government's {{policy of}} {{cultural}} suppression against Highland culture culminated in 1747 when the Act of Proscription, which forbade {{the wearing of}} kilts by civilian males, went into effect. The Act was repealed in 1782 {{and in the early}} 19th century, there was something of a romanticisation of Highland culture (or such as it was imagined to be). This revival, later boosted greatly by Queen Victoria's enthusiasm for it, included the beginnings of the Highland games <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>know</b> them. Highland dancing {{was an integral part of}} the Games from the very start of their modern revival, but the selection of dances performed at Games was intentionally narrowed down, mostly for the convenience of judges. Therefore, while the tradition of Highland games seemed at first glance to have fostered and preserved Highland dancing, many older dances got lost because nobody considered them worthwhile to practice, as they were not required for competition. The nature of these displays and competitions also affected the style of the dancing itself.|$|E

2500|$|Chu shogi (中将棋 chū shōgi or Middle Shogi) is a {{strategy}} board game native to Japan. It is similar to modern shogi (sometimes called Japanese chess) in its rules and gameplay. Its name means [...] "mid-sized shogi", from {{a time when there}} were three sizes of shogi variants that were regularly being played. Chu shogi seems to have been developed in the early 14th century as a derivative of dai shogi ("large shogi").

40|$|Until recently, Soviet {{economic}} theorists operated {{with only}} one concept of the transition period which was contained in all political economy textbooks. This is the period of transition from capitalism to socialism. In actual fact, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> well <b>know,</b> this period dragged on for seven decades. It {{turned out that the}} transition was in the wrong direction and that it was necessary to return to the starting point. However, with the "transition to the market" today, the question of what we should return to is, in some strange fashion, skirted, and instead the mass media actively propagandize the primitive idea that if everything is not distributed according to plan, but is bought and sold, our lives will be rich and happy. ...|$|R

2500|$|Self-experimentation {{has value}} in rapidly obtaining the first results. [...] In some cases, such as with Forssmann's {{experiments}} done {{in defiance of}} official permission, results may be obtained that would never otherwise have come to light. [...] However, self-experiment lacks the statistical validity of a larger experiment. [...] It {{is not possible to}} generalise from an experiment on a single person. [...] For instance, a single successful blood transfusion does not indicate, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>know</b> from the work of Karl Landsteiner, that all such transfusions between any two random people will also be successful. [...] Likewise, a single failure does not absolutely prove that a procedure is worthless. [...] Psychological issues such as confirmation bias and the placebo effect are unavoidable in a single-person self-experiment where {{it is not possible to}} put scientific controls in place.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{like most}} such claims, this is debated by others {{who claim to}} {{remember}} similar burritos from earlier in the decade.
