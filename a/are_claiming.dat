2500|$|Nevertheless, the {{completion}} of the Torah and its elevation to the centre of post-Exilic Judaism was as much or more about combining older texts as writing new ones – the final Pentateuch was based on existing traditions. In Ezekiel , written during the Exile (i.e., {{in the first half of}} the 6th century BCE), Ezekiel, an exile in Babylon, tells how those who remained in Judah <b>are</b> <b>claiming</b> ownership of the land based on inheritance from Abraham; but the prophet tells them they have no claim because they don't observe Torah. Isaiah [...] similarly testifies of tension between the people of Judah and the returning post-Exilic Jews (the [...] "gôlâ"), stating that God is the father of Israel and that Israel's history begins with the Exodus and not with Abraham. The conclusion to be inferred from this and similar evidence (e.g., Ezra-Nehemiah), is that the figure of Abraham must have been preeminent among the great landowners of Judah at the time of the Exile and after, serving to support their claims to the land in opposition to those of the returning exiles.|$|E
2500|$|In the United Kingdom, degrees {{may only}} be awarded by {{institutions}} that have degree-awarding powers recognised by the UK authorities (the UK parliament, the Scottish parliament, the National Assembly for Wales or the Northern Ireland Assembly). Some institutions do not have degree-awarding powers but provide complete courses leading to recognised UK degrees that are validated by institutions which have degree-awarding powers. The UK authorities recognise those institutions which have been granted degree-awarding powers by either a Royal charter, an Act of Parliament or the Privy Council. These degree-awarding institutions are known as [...] "recognised bodies." [...] All UK universities and some higher education colleges are [...] "recognised bodies." [...] If an institution is not a [...] "recognised body" [...] or makes degree awards not validated by such a body, {{it is likely to}} be a degree mill. It is an offence against section 214 of the Education Reform Act 1988 for any organisation to offer a degree qualification which could be taken to be that of a UK institution unless it is a [...] "recognised body." [...] The UK Border Agency maintains a list of institutions licensed to sponsor migrant students so that overseas students can check that they are attending an appropriate institution, and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) maintain a directory of higher education providers regulated in England. Higher Education Degree Datacheck (HEDD) is an initiative sponsored by HEFCE which aims to prevent Higher Education fraud in the UK by maintaining a list of UK degree-awarding bodies, including name changes, mergers and antecedents since 1990, and where institutions that <b>are</b> <b>claiming</b> to be universities are known to be bogus, these are also listed.|$|E

60|$|The {{story of}} Ruth {{is also the}} consecration of woman's love. I do not mean of the love of wife to husband, divine and blessed as that is.

How right she is in doing it!

60|$|But if this danger {{exists for}} all men, it exists {{especially}} for the Englishman. The Englishman is never so insular as when he is imperial; except indeed when he is international. In private life {{he is a good}} friend and in practical politics generally a good ally. But theoretical politics are more practical than practical politics. And in theoretical politics the Englishman is the worst ally the world ever saw. This is all the more curious because he has passed so much of his historical life in the character of an ally. He has been in twenty great alliances and never understood one of them. He has never been farther away from European politics than when he was fighting heroically in the thick of them. I myself think that this splendid isolation is sometimes really splendid; so long as it is isolation and does not imagine itself to be imperialism or internationalism. With the idea of being international, with the idea of being imperial, comes the frantic and farcical idea of being impartial. Generally speaking, men are never so mean and false and hypocritical as when they are occupied in being impartial. They are performing the first and most typical of all the actions of the devil; they <b>are</b> <b>claiming</b> the throne of God. Even when it is not hypocrisy but only mental confusion, it is always a confusion worse and worse confounded. We see it in the impartial historians of the Victorian Age, who now seem far more Victorian than the partial historians. Hallam wrote about the Middle Ages; but Hallam was far less mediaeval than Macaulay; for Macaulay was at least a fighter. Huxley had more mediaeval sympathies than Herbert Spencer for the same reason; that Huxley was a fighter. They both fought in many ways for the limitations of their own rationalistic epoch; but they were nearer the truth than the men who simply assumed those limitations as rational. The war of the controversionalists was a wider thing than the peace of the arbiters. And in the same way the Englishman never cuts a less convincing figure before other nations than when he tries to arbitrate between them.|$|E
