The film remains the best-known of the hundreds of films made by Méliès, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> in which the capsule lands in the Moon's eye {{remains one of the most}} iconic and frequently referenced images in the history of cinema. It is widely regarded as the earliest example of the science fiction film genre and, more generally, as one of the most influential films in cinema history.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May 1940, Leopold met senior {{representatives of}} his Government {{for a final}} time at the Kasteel van Wijnendale in West Flanders. The meeting is {{frequently}} cited as {{the start of the}} Royal Question <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> of the decisive break between King and Government. Four ministers of the Government were present: Hubert Pierlot, Paul-Henri Spaak, Henri Denis and Arthur Vanderpoorten. By the time of the meeting, {{against the backdrop of the}} bloody Battle of the Lys, the Belgian government was preparing to continue the fight against Germany from exile in France. They urged the King to join them, following the examples of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. The King rejected their arguments and hardened his own position. He refused to leave Belgian territory and his army in Flanders at any cost. The ministers suspected that Leopold's aides were already negotiating with the Germans. The meeting broke up with no agreement and the Belgian Government left for France.|$|E

25|$|Kierkegaard’s {{influence}} on Barth’s early theology {{is evident in}} The Epistle to the Romans. The early Barth read at least three volumes of Kierkegaard’s works: Practice in Christianity, The Moment, and an Anthology from his journals and diaries. Almost all key terms from Kierkegaard which had {{an important role in}} The Epistle to the Romans can be found in Practice in Christianity.

25|$|The {{production}} design and cinematography also won some praise from critics. Claire Sisco King called {{the use of}} real footage unconventional and disruptive in a positive way. The editing was described as akin {{to that of a}} music video, and critic Laura Kern found it effectively paced. Michael Koresky described Joey's death scene in the red-drenched bathroom very effectively staged, although Peter Hartlaub found that the lighting obscured the action rather than enhancing it. Except for the strobe light effects during Chaz's death <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> when the killer's scythe touches Eddie's glass eye, Kern found the special effects only average.|$|E
25|$|The {{challenges}} of the global food crisis followed by {{challenges of}} the global financial crisis made room for more integrated policy reforms.

Indeed, moderate financial panic occurred driven—at least partially—by the fear that other investors are about to panic and sell. There were falls in stock and bond market prices, and rises in nominal interest rates.|$|E

25|$|Scorpions are {{opportunistic}} predators {{of small}} arthropods, although the larger kinds {{have been known}} to kill small lizards and mice. The large pincers are studded with highly sensitive tactile hair, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> an insect touches these, they use their chelae (pincers) to catch the prey. Depending on the toxicity of their venom and size of their claws, they will then either crush the prey or inject it with neurotoxic venom. This will kill or paralyze the prey so the scorpion can eat it. Scorpions have an unusual style of eating using chelicerae, small claw-like structures that protrude from the mouth that are unique to the Chelicerata among arthropods. The chelicerae, which are very sharp, are used to pull small amounts of food off the prey item for digestion into a pre-oral cavity below the chelicerae and carapace. Scorpions can ingest food only in a liquid form; they have external digestion. The digestive juices from the gut are egested onto the food and the digested food sucked in liquid form. Any solid indigestible matter (fur, exoskeleton, etc.) is trapped by setae in the pre-oral cavity, which is ejected by the scorpion.|$|E

[...] During the 1920 legislative session, the Republicans held a majority in the state House of Representatives and were a minority by only two votes in the state Senate. During the session, Morrow was often able to convince C. W. Burton, a Democratic senator from Grant County, to support Republican proposals. Tie votes in the Senate were broken by Republican lieutenant governor S. Thruston Ballard. Consequently, Morrow was able to effect a considerable reorganization of the state government, including replacing the Board of Control with a nonpartisan Board of Charities and Corrections, centralizing highway works, and revising property taxes. He oversaw improvements to the education system, including better textbook selection and a tax on racetracks to support a minimum salary for teachers. Among Morrow's reforms that did not pass was a proposal to make the judiciary nonpartisan.|$|E
500|$|D'Este {{wrote that}} the failure to unhinge the German front line south of Caen and outflank the I SS Panzer Corps, was [...] "one of the costliest Allied mistakes" [...] of the campaign. With the British {{withdrawal}} the chance of mounting a [...] "snap airborne operation" [...] to seize Caen or to deepen the Allied bridgehead had been lost. Wilmot wrote that after the battle, [...] "Caen [...] be taken only by a set-piece assault". Hastings called Villers-Bocage a [...] "debacle" [...] <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> which [...] "marked, for the British, {{the end of the}} scramble for ground that had continued since D-Day". Reynolds {{wrote that the}} consequences of the battle would be felt in the coming weeks, during the costly attacks needed to drive the Germans from Caen and the surrounding area. The official 7th Armoured Division history called the battle indecisive: [...] "... the brilliant defensive battle of Villers Bocage ..., although it obliged us to withdraw some seven miles, cost the enemy casualties disproportionate to this gain". This view is shared by Taylor, who wrote that the battle ended with no clear winner.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} Quatermass serials, Cartier and Kneale collaborated on several one-off dramas, {{including}} literary and theatrical adaptations of Wuthering Heights (6 December 1953) <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Moment</b> of Truth (10 March 1955), {{as well as}} Kneale's own The Creature (30 January 1955). Of particular note was their collaboration on an adaptation of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, originally broadcast on 12 December 1954, regarded as Cartier's most famous work. The Timess review the day after its broadcast noted its [...] "vividness... the two minutes' hate was, for instance, a wonderfully riotious orgy of vindictiveness." [...] The production also attracted considerable controversy. There were questions asked in the House of Commons concerning some of the graphic scenes of horror in the play, and the BBC received several telephone calls threatening Cartier's life if the second live performance, scheduled for 16 December, went ahead. The BBC took these threats seriously enough to assign him bodyguards. Cartier appeared live on television himself to defend the production in a studio debate, and eventually the Board of Governors of the BBC voted that the second performance should go ahead as planned. The production had by this time received {{the backing of the}} Duke of Edinburgh, who commented during a speech to the Royal Society of Arts that he and the Queen had watched and enjoyed the first performance.|$|E

The following year, she was named [...] "India's top brand endorser" [...] by the same agency, becoming the first woman to top the endorsement charts in India. Manish Porwal of Alchemist Talent Solutions said in 2012 that Chopra was a stable and dependable brand endorser, and many brands renewed their contract with her. Chopra has represented many brands, including TAG Heuer, Pepsi, Nokia, Garnier and Nestlé; she was the first female representative of Hero Honda. She and three other Bollywood actors (Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Hrithik Roshan) had their likenesses made into a series of miniature dolls for Hasbro and the UK-based Bollywood Legends Corporation. In 2009, Chopra became the first Indian actress to cast a foot impression at the Salvatore Ferragamo Museum in Florence, Italy, and she received custom-designed shoes from the Ferragamo house. In 2013, she became the first Indian model to represent Guess, whose CEO Paul Marciano called her [...] "the young Sophia Loren".

500|$|The table below lists Ottoman sultans, {{as well as}} {{the last}} Ottoman caliph, in chronological order. The tughras were the calligraphic seals or {{signatures}} used by Ottoman sultans. They were displayed on all official documents as well as on coins, and were far more important in identifying a sultan than his portrait. The [...] "Notes" [...] column contains information on each sultan's parentage and fate. For earlier rulers, there is usually a time gap between the moment a sultan's reign ended <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> his successor was enthroned. This is because the Ottomans in that era practiced what historian Quataert has described as [...] "survival of the fittest, not eldest, son": when a sultan died, his sons had to fight each other for the throne until a victor emerged. Because of the infighting and numerous fratricides that occurred, a sultan's death date therefore did not always coincide with the accession date of his successor. In 1617, the law of succession changed from survival of the fittest to a system based on agnatic seniority ( [...] ekberiyet), whereby the throne went to the oldest male of the family. This in turn explains why from the 17th century onwards a deceased sultan was rarely succeeded by his own son, but usually by an uncle or brother. Agnatic seniority was retained until the abolition of the sultanate, despite unsuccessful attempts in the 19th century to replace it with primogeniture.|$|E
