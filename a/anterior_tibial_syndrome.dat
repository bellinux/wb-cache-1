40|$|ABSTRACT: I {{studied the}} results of {{fasciotomy}} of the affected muscle compartment in eight patients with chronic anterior-compartment syndrome (involvement of the <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> compartment) and in nine patients with medial <b>tibial</b> <b>syndrome</b> (involvement of the deep posterior compartment), {{all of whom had}} pain with ex-ercise. In the patients with chronic anterior-compart-ment syndrome, the preoperative intramuscular pressure in the <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> compartment, as mea-sured by the wick-catheter method, was increased ten minutes after exercise to 52 ± 36 millimeters of mercury. After fasciotomy this pressure was significantly lowered to 4 ± 6 millimeters of mercury (p < 0. 01).

40|$|Introduction. <b>Anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> muscle hernia is {{the most}} {{frequent}} lower extremities muscle hernia. The aim {{of this paper was}} to present a possibility of a new surgical technique for <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> muscle hernia reparation. Case report. We presented three cases of <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> muscle hernia in adolescents. The cases were diagnosed clinically and ultrasonographycally. In all three cases reconstruction was done with periosteal patch plasty of fascial defect. Conclusions.

40|$|Ankle {{arthroscopy}} {{carries a}} {{lower risk of}} vascular complications when standard anterolateral and anteromedial portals are used. However, {{the thickness of the}} fat pad at the anterior ankle affords little protection for the thin-walled <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> artery, rendering it susceptible to indirect damage during procedures performed on the anterior ankle joint. To our knowledge, only 11 cases of pseudoaneurysm involving the <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> artery after ankle arthroscopy have been described in the literature. Here we reported a rare case of a 19 -year-old soccer player who presented with pseudoaneurysm of the <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> artery following ankle arthroscopy using an ankle distraction method and underwent anastomosis for the <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> artery injury. Excessive distraction of the ankle puts the neurovascular structures at greater risk for iatrogenic injury of the <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> artery during ankle arthroscopy. Surgeons should look carefully for postoperative ankle swelling and pain after ankle arthroscopy...|$|R
30|$|As the ACL {{worked against}} <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> drawer, the <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> {{translation}} under <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> load {{increased in the}} ACL-injured knee (Amis & Dawkins 1991; Markolf et al. 1984). Amis et al. (1991) reported that the <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation increased by approximately 140 % after removal of the ACL on application of 150  N of <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> load at 20 ° of flexion. Besides, Markolf et al. (1984) reported the increased V-V laxity in the ACL-deficient knee in response to V-V torque, as compared {{to that in the}} intact knee. Our results showed that the V-V laxity increased under V-V torque, while the in situ force of the ACL was 16 – 30  N under 5  Nm of varus and valgus torques, respectively. Thus, the ACL also had a restraining force against V-V rotation of the knee joint (Grood et al. 1981; Markolf et al. 1990). In addition, the tibia in the ACL-deficient knee located more anteriorly than in the intact knee even under non-weight bearing conditions (DeFrate et al. 2006; Matsuo et al. 2014; Mishima et al. 2005). Matuso et al. (2014) reported that the <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation in the ACL-deficient knee was 1.4  mm greater than that in the normal knee in supine and extended knee position. Hence, the <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation was assumed {{to be associated with the}} greater V-V laxity in the ACL-deficient knee. In the present study, the increase in V-V laxity in the ACL-deficient knee was attenuated by adding posterior tibial load because the <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation was restrained. These findings suggest that posterior tibial load should be applied during assessment of V-V instability in the ACL-deficient knee for accurate physical evaluation of the V-V laxity.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify possible predisposing neuromuscular factors for knee injuries, particularly anterior cruciate ligament tears in female athletes by investigating anterior knee laxity, lower extremity muscle strength, endurance, muscle reaction time, and muscle recruitment order in response to <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation. We recruited four subject groups: elite female (N = 40) and male (N = 60) athletes and sex-matched nonathletic controls (N = 40). All participants underwent a subjective evaluation of knee function, arthrometer measurement of <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation, isokinetic dynamometer strength and endurance tests at 60 and 240 deg/sec, and <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation stress tests. Dynamic stress testing of muscles demonstrated less <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation in the knees of the athletes (both men and women) com pared with the nonathletic controls. Female athletes and controls demonstrated more <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> laxity than their male counterparts and significantly less mus cle strength and endurance. Compared with the male athletes, the female athletes took significantly longer to generate maximum hamstring muscle torque during isokinetic testing. Although {{no significant differences were found}} in either spinal or cortical muscle reaction times, the muscle recruitment order in some female athletes was markedly different. The female athletes appeared to rely more on their quadriceps muscles in response to <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation; the three other test groups relied more on their hamstring muscles for initial knee stabilization...|$|R

Several intensities of stimulation were employed. In every instance the recovery curves showed two distinct peaks of facilitation, which appeared with the same delay in muscles with antagonist functions. Also, reciprocal facilitation and inhibition phenomena which occurred after a 25 ms delay and which lasted more than 1000 ms were observed. The intervention of suprasegmentary neuronal mechanisms is proposed to explain the facilitation peaks, while the longer lasting phenomena are probably dependent on spinal processes...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To examine {{differences}} in <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation in 3 groups: single-bundle {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) -reconstructed, double-bundle ACL-reconstructed, and ACL-intact knees under gradual dynamic quadriceps muscle activation. Methods: Thirty male patients underwent successful single-bundle (n = 15) and double-bundle (n = 15) ACL reconstructions; 15 healthy controls {{were included in the}} study. <b>Anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation was assessed at 30 degrees of knee flexion in the resting position (0 % quadriceps activation) and under 50 % and 100 % of maximum quadriceps concentric contraction using an isokinetic dynamometer with the KT- 2000 arthrometer securely attached to the participants' knees. Results: The 2 ACL-reconstructed groups were similar regarding International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Score (KOOS), Tegner, and Lysholm scores and preliminary isokinetic evaluation (P =. 38). Quadriceps activation significantly affected <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation (P =. 001, alpha = 0. 98). In all 3 study groups, <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation was significantly higher under 100 % quadriceps activation compared with 0 % contraction (P =. 01) and 50 % quadriceps activation (P =. 047). There were no between-group {{differences in}} <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation with 0 %, 50 %, or 100 % quadriceps activation (P =. 46). Conclusions: Under quadriceps muscle activation, anteroposterior knee laxity in ACL-intact and ACL-reconstructed knees is gradually increased. Single-bundle and double-bundle ACL-reconstructed knees show a similar increase in <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation under gradual quadriceps contraction. When comparing different ACL reconstruction techniques in the experimental setting, dynamic, in addition to static, testing is advised to reach a comprehensive assessment of anteroposterior knee stability...|$|R

Material/Methods: Eighty-one randomly selected in-patients with T 2 DM were divided into 2 groups – a vascular complication neg-ative group (n= 42) and a vascular complication positive group (n= 39). Forty healthy volunteers were enrolled in a control group. Ultrasonographic scans using Xstrain ™ technique were conducted for every patient to ob-tain the maximum circumferential strain (CSmax) of <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> artery; patient blood pressure was also mea-sured for calculating strain-blood pressure index (SBPI=CSmax / [(local pulse pressure) / local diastolic blood pressure] × 100 %.

40|$|The routine use of {{functional}} knee braces in the ante rior cruciate ligament-deficient, injured, or recon structed knee, lacks biomechanical support. Although subjective reports favoring bracing are plentiful, objec tive proof of significant control of tibial translation is not. This in vivo {{study was designed}} to assess the effect of six popular braces on <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation, isoki netic performance, and neuromuscular function in five chronically unstable anterior cruciate ligament-defi cient knees. A knee stress test was performed on a specially designed device that allowed free tibial move ment while monitoring <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation and muscle function in the quadriceps, hamstring, and gas trocnemius muscles. Results show that braces can decrease <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation between 28. 8 % and 39. 1 % without the stabilizing contractions of the ham string, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius muscles. With lower extremity muscle activation and bracing, <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation was decreased between 69. 8 % and 84. 9 %. Some improvement in spinal level muscle re action times was seen with brace use, especially in the quadriceps muscle.

40|$|The medial {{collateral}} ligament (MCL) is {{the primary}} restraint to knee valgus rotation and a secondary restraint to <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation. The <b>anterior</b> cruciate ligament (ACL) is a primary restraint to <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation, but its contribution to valgus restraint was debated. To address this, a combined experimental and computational {{study was conducted to}} determine the effect of ACL injury on MCL insertion site and contact forces during valgus loading and <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> loading. Six finite element (FE) models were constructed and used to simulate boundary and loading conditions from corresponding cadaveric experiments. It was shown that in the ACL-deficient knee, the MCL is indeed subjected to higher insertion site and contact forces in response to an anterior load. However, MCL forces due to a valgus torque were not significantly increased in the ACL-deficient knee. It follows that the MCL resists <b>anterior</b> <b>tibial</b> translation when the ACL is intact, but the ACL is not a restraint to valgus rotation when a healthy MCL is present.
