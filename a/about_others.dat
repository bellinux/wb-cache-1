5|$|By 2005, Marvel Entertainment began {{planning}} to independently produce its own films and distribute them through Paramount Pictures. Previously, Marvel had co-produced several superhero films with Columbia Pictures, New Line Cinema and others, including a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox. Marvel made relatively little profit from its licensing deals with other studios {{and wanted to}} get more money out of its films while maintaining artistic control of the projects and distribution. Avi Arad, head of Marvel's film division, was pleased with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films at Sony, but was less pleased <b>about</b> <b>others.</b> As a result, they decided to form Marvel Studios, Hollywood's first major independent movie studio since DreamWorks.|$|E
5|$|The new {{pieces were}} {{publicly}} announced on May 15, 1965, and coin dealers immediately offered $7.50 each for them, ensuring {{that they would}} not circulate. The public announcement prompted a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources during a severe coin shortage, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 dollars had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure {{that there would be no}} repetition, Congress inserted a provision in the Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. No 1964-D Peace dollars are known to exist in either public or private hands. Two specimens were discovered in a Treasury vault in 1970 and were destroyed, but rumors and speculation <b>about</b> <b>others</b> in illegal private possession continue to appear from time to time. The issue has also been privately restruck using unofficial dies and genuine, earlier-date Peace dollars resulting in an altered date.|$|E
25|$|Individuals know a {{lot more}} about {{themselves}} than they do <b>about</b> <b>others.</b> Because information <b>about</b> <b>others</b> is less available, information about the self versus others leads people to make specific conclusions about their own risk, but results in them having a harder time making conclusions about the risks of others. This leads to differences in judgments and conclusions about self-risks compared to the risks of others, leading to larger gaps in the optimistic bias.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{possible}} that someone can escape egocentric thinking. In one study, researchers had one group of participants list all factors that influenced their chances of experiencing a variety of events, and then a second group read the list. Those who read the list showed less optimistic bias in their own reports. It's possible that greater knowledge <b>about</b> <b>others</b> and their perceptions of their chances of risk bring the comparison group closer to the participant.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} of the optimistic bias is that people know more about themselves than they do <b>about</b> <b>others.</b> While individuals know how to think about themselves as a single person, they still think of others as a generalized group, which leads to biased estimates and inabilities to sufficiently understand their target or comparison group. Likewise, when making judgments and comparisons about their risk compared to others, people generally ignore the average person, but primarily focus on their own feelings and experiences.|$|E
25|$|In summary, {{the mental}} working models that {{underlie}} attachment styles appear to contain information about self and information <b>about</b> <b>others</b> organized into relational schemas. The relational schemas are themselves organized into a three-tier hierarchy. The {{highest level of}} the hierarchy contains relational schemas for a general working model that applies to all relationships. The middle level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for working models that apply to different types of relationships (e.g., friends, parents, lovers). The lowest level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for working models of specific relationships.|$|E

25|$|The {{main concern}} with {{individuals}} with autism regarding learning {{is in the}} imitation of skills. This can be a barrier in many aspects such as learning <b>about</b> <b>others</b> intentions, mental states, speech, language, and general social skills. Individuals with autism tend {{to be dependent on}} the routines that they have already mastered, and have difficulty with initiating new non-routine tasks. Although an estimated 25–40% of people with autism also have a learning disability, many will demonstrate an impressive rote memory and memory for factual knowledge. As such, repetition is the primary and most successful method for instruction when teaching people with autism.|$|E
25|$|The {{secure and}} dismissive {{attachment}} styles {{are associated with}} higher self-esteem compared to the anxious and fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about the self in working models. The secure and anxious attachment styles are associated with higher sociability than the dismissive or fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts <b>about</b> <b>others</b> in working models. These results suggested working models indeed contain two distinct domains—thoughts about self and thoughts about others—and that each domain {{can be characterized as}} generally positive or generally negative.|$|E
25|$|People with BPD {{can be very}} {{sensitive}} to the way others treat them, by feeling intense joy and gratitude at perceived expressions of kindness, and intense sadness or anger at perceived criticism or hurtfulness. Their feelings <b>about</b> <b>others</b> often shift from admiration or love to anger or dislike after a disappointment, a threat of losing someone, or a perceived loss of esteem {{in the eyes of}} someone they value. This phenomenon, sometimes called splitting, includes a shift from idealizing others to devaluing them. Combined with mood disturbances, idealization and devaluation can undermine relationships with family, friends, and co-workers. Self-image can also change rapidly from healthy to unhealthy.|$|E

25|$|Marx {{also argues}} that, insofar as {{capitalist}} class society is intrinsically a very contradictory system – it contains many conflicting and competing forces – the masking of its true characteristics becomes an integral feature {{of how it}} actually operates. Buyers and sellers compete with other buyers and sellers. Businesses cannot practically do so without confidentiality and secrecy. Workers compete for job opportunities and access to resources. Capitalists and workers compete for {{their share of the}} new wealth that is produced, and nations compete with other nations. The masks are therefore not optional, but necessary, and the more one is able to know <b>about</b> <b>others,</b> the more subtle, ingenious and sophisticated the masks become.|$|E

25|$|DeNeve (1999) {{argued that}} there are three trends in the {{relationship}} between personality and SWB. Firstly, SWB is closely tied to traits associated with emotional tendencies (emotional stability, positive affectivity, and tension). Secondly, relationship enhancing traits (e.g. trust, affiliation) are important for subjective well-being. Happy people tend to have strong relationships and be good at fostering them. Thirdly, the way people think about and explain events is important for subjective well-being. Appraising events in an optimistic fashion, having a sense of control, and making active coping efforts facilitates subjective well-being. Trust, a trait substantially related to SWB, as opposed to cynicism involves making positive rather than negative attributions <b>about</b> <b>others.</b> Making positive, optimistic attributions rather than negative pessimistic ones facilitates subjective well-being.|$|E

Campers live together in tents at the US camps, and in rooms at the European camp. Bunking assignments are changed every two weeks, so that each student shares accommodations with 16 different young people {{over the course of a}} summer, during the course of which he or she is exposed to many different cultures and individuals. Dining hall table assignments are changed weekly, further supporting the opportunity to learn <b>about</b> <b>others</b> and make new friendships.

25|$|The series {{focuses on}} several social themes such as faith, organ {{donation}} {{and the treatment}} of middle-aged men. However, the main philosophy seen across the story is the individualism, the stance which emphasizes the moral worth of an individual. Subaru and Hokuto believe that nobody can fully understand another person's suffering. Despite his belief in this philosophy, Subaru is a resigned individual who worries more <b>about</b> <b>others</b> than himself. This is because Subaru believes he can hurt others {{with the idea that}} he will never understand other people. The same problem comes from the fact Subaru and Hokuto are twins and as a result try to live in order to see each other as different people. Across the plot, Subaru develops as an individual as his actions are deemed as arrogant by Seishiro for taking the guilt. Additionally, he starts taking actions that he believes are immoral despite his reasons for them such as lying to a mother about her daughter's wish to stop her from taking revenge.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{children}} raised under the Kibbutz system of equality are given by Yosef Criden. When an aunt {{from a nearby}} city comes to visit her niece or nephew and brings a box of chocolate as a present for them, the child will excitedly open it up and eat {{a few of the}} chocolates. Then the child will go over {{to the rest of the}} group and give the rest of the chocolates to their peers. This is the ideology instilled in the children, to value the self but also to always think <b>about</b> <b>others.</b> Another example Yosef gives is that when his son, who was born and raised on a kibbutz, went into the army, he and his fellow bunk mates asked their supervising officer for a box. They wanted to keep the box in the middle of the room and whenever they would get care packages, they would put the items into the box and share them communally. They did not want to be like most of the units of officers from towns and cities, where each officer would hide their packages under their beds.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} investigated negotiators' information search strategies as {{a function}} of other's personality (cooperative vs. competitive vs. unknown) and own social value orientation (pro-social vs. selfish). In Experiment 1, participants selected questions <b>about</b> <b>other's</b> intention to cooperate or to compete. In Experiment 2, participants generated questions themselves, which were coded as asking about cooperation or competition. Consistent with the false-consensus hypothesis (Ross, Greene, & House, 1977) and inconsistent with the triangle hypothesis (Kelley & Stahelski, 1970), selfish negotiators who had no information <b>about</b> the <b>other's</b> personality asked more questions <b>about</b> <b>other's</b> intention to compete, and pro-social negotiators asked more questions <b>about</b> <b>other's</b> intention to cooperate. Furthermore, both selfish and pro-social negotiators engaged in confirmatory information search. Implications in terms of a self-fulfilling prophecy are discussed...|$|R
