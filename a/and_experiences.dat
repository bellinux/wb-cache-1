40|$|The {{importance}} of education <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> {{to the successful}} performance of new firms is well recognized both by management practitioners and academics.

Possible reasons for conflicting results are identified, such as lack of sound theoretical bases that relate education <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> to performance, varying definitions of the key variables and the diversity of measures used. Finally, a framework is developed that incorporates variables that interact with <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> education to influence new venture performance...|$|R
