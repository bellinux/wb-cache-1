40|$|Recursive Bayesian {{estimation}} using sequential Monte Carlos methods is {{a powerful}} numerical technique to understand latent dynamics of non-linear non-Gaussian dynamical systems. Classical sequential Monte Carlos suffer from weight degeneracy {{which is where the}} number of distinct particles collapse. Traditionally this is addressed by resampling, which effectively replaces high weight particles with many particles with high inter-particle correlation. Frequent resampling, however, leads to a lack of diversity amongst the particle set in a problem known as sample impoverishment. Traditional sequential Monte Carlo methods attempt to resolve this correlated problem however introduce further data processing issues leading to minimal to comparable performance improvements over the sequential Monte Carlo particle filter. A new method, the <b>adaptive</b> <b>path</b> particle filter, is proposed for recursive Bayesian estimation of non-linear non-Gaussian dynamical systems. Our method addresses the weight degeneracy and sample impoverishment problem by embedding a computational intelligence step of <b>adaptive</b> <b>path</b> switching between generations based on maximal likelihood as a fitness function. Preliminary tests on a scalar estimation problem with non-linear non-Gaussian dynamics and a non-stationary observation model and the traditional univariate stochastic volatility problem are presented. Building on these preliminary results, we evaluate our <b>adaptive</b> <b>path</b> particle filter on the stochastic volatility estimation problem. We calibrate the Heston stochastic volatility model employing a Markov chain Monte Carlo on six securities. Finally, we investigate the efficacy of sequential Monte Carlos for recursive Bayesian estimation of astrophysical time series. We posit latent dynamics for both regularized and irregular astrophysical time series, calibrating fifty-five quasar time series using the CAR(1) model. We find the <b>adaptive</b> <b>path</b> particle filter to statistically significantly outperform the standard sequential importance resampling particle filter, the Markov chain Monte Carlo particle filter and, upon Heston model estimation, the particle learning algorithm particle filter. In addition, from our quasar MCMC calibration we find the characteristic timescale τ to be first-order stable in contradiction to the literature though indicative of a unified underlying structure. We offer detailed analysis throughout, and conclude with a discussion and suggestions for future work...|$|E

In this work, we focus on improving the perceived quality of video streaming through dynamic path selection. Selecting one of several Internet paths is possible using multihoming and/or an over-lay routing infrastructure. We conduct an experimental comparison of various measurement-based path selection techniques for video stream-ing. The path selection is based on the measurement of network-layer metrics, such as loss rate, jitter or available bandwidth, while the video quality is evaluated based on the VQM tool. Our experiments show that the most eective technique for <b>adaptive</b> <b>path</b> selection relies on an es-timate of the lower bound of the available bandwidth variation range.

Their design increasingly includes a challenge to high faulttolerance, as entire systems become complicated. This paper presents a partial irregular-network routing {{in order to provide}} a high fault-tolerance in k-ary n-cube networks. Since an irregular-network routing usually performs poorly in k-ary n-cube networks, it is only used for progressive deadlock-recovery, and avoiding hard failures. The network is logically divided into the fault and regular regions. In the regular region, most packets are transferred along fully <b>adaptive</b> <b>paths</b> that are computed, assuming that there are no hard failures, so as to uniformly distribute the traffic. Simulation results show that the proposed routing achieves the same throughput as that of Duato’s protocol under no hard failures. As the number of faulty links increases to up to 8 on 256 nodes, its throughput is only decreased by 15 %. Moreover, the throughput of the proposed deadlockrecovery routing is almost maintained during a dynamic reconfiguration...|$|R

40|$|A fitness {{landscape}} is a genetic space – with two genotypes adjacent if they differ {{in a single}} locus – and a fitness function. Evolutionary dynamics produce a flow on this landscape from lower fitness to higher; reaching equilibrium only if a local fitness peak is found. I use computational complexity to question the common assumption that evolution on static fitness landscapes can quickly reach a local fitness peak. I do this by showing that the popular NK model of rugged fitness landscapes is PLS-complete for K ≥ 2; the reduction from Weighted 2 SAT is a bijection on adaptive walks, so there are NK fitness landscapes where every <b>adaptive</b> <b>path</b> from some vertices is of exponential length. Alternatively – under the standard complexity theoretic assumption that there are problems in PLS not solvable in polynomial time – this means {{that there are no}} evolutionary dynamics (known, or to be discovered, and not necessarily following adaptive paths) that can converge to a local fitness peak on all NK landscapes with K = 2. Applying results from the analysis of simplex algorithms, I show that there exist single-peaked landscapes with no reciprocal sign epistasis where the expected length of an <b>adaptive</b> <b>path</b> following strong selection weak mutation dynamics is eO(n 1 / 3) even though an <b>adaptive</b> <b>path</b> to the optimum of length less than n is available from every vertex.
