5|$|On 2 February 1996, {{the tunnel}} company had an {{agreement}} with Bru og Tunnelskelskapet, which operates the Bergen Toll Ring, to collect the tolls in the tunnel using the Autopass automatic toll collection system. A manual collection system was estimated to cost NOK1.4 million per year, while an <b>automated</b> <b>system</b> was estimated at NOK0.4 million. The tunnel opened on 7 May 1996, {{the same day the}} last ferry ran. Originally the plan was to charge tolls similar to the ferry. With a manual system, it would not be possible to charge for two-wheeled vehicles and passengers, so the fares for other vehicles were raised slightly. In 1995, it had cost NOK44 for a single passing with a car on the ferry. The tolls were set to NOK120 for all types of vehicles, except two-wheelers, and NOK72 was charged per travel with pre-paid ticket books. Bus riders had to pay for two extra zones. The toll plaza was open a few hour each week to allow people to purchase discounted tickets.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Automated {{teaching}} aids have become widespread {{during the last}} few years also in the universities in Finland. Studies have been made on the impact of these systems on the teaching results, and results have generally been encouraging. In this research the general attitudes of students towards automated learning environments and automated assessment are evaluated by surveys made to the participants of two courses in which <b>automated</b> <b>systems</b> have been recently adopted. The research shows that <b>automated</b> <b>systems</b> are in general trusted and preferred by the students. Independent of their own success, students consider <b>automated</b> <b>systems</b> to be more professional and to treat the students equally. However, the students did not endorse the adoption of <b>automated</b> <b>systems</b> without reservations: developers and teachers need to remember the importance of human interaction and to spend appropriate effort in evaluating the need for and the quality of <b>automated</b> <b>systems</b> instead of adopting them without reservations. ...|$|R

5|$|The Port Authority {{voted to}} proceed with the {{scaled-down}} system in 1996. A final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for the JFK people mover, conducted by the Port Authority and released in 1997, examined eight possible transport improvements that could be constructed in order to provide this direct connection. Ultimately, a light rail with the qualities of a people mover, tentatively called the JFK Light Rail System, was selected as the most feasible mode of transportation for the new system. It would replace the shuttle buses that traveled between the terminals as well as to and from Howard Beach. The FEIS determined that an <b>automated</b> <b>system</b> with frequent headways was the most optimal design. The light rail would run from the airport terminals to either Jamaica or Howard Beach. It had been almost 30 years between the first JFK rail link proposal and the approval of the light rail system; within that time period, there had been 21 proposals for direct rail links to New York-area airports, which were all canceled.|$|E

However, even the <b>automated</b> <b>system</b> is not fool-proof, as the computer can miscount the number of pins that remain standing.|$|E
