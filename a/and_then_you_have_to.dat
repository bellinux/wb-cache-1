It's when you're so stoked about something <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> sing a song that bums you out. And I'll never live down when I licked a sledgehammer." ...|$|E
500|$|Oh said of Yang's {{expressions}} of emotions during season eight: [...] "You see her express her emotions {{with only two}} people: her best friend Meredith and her husband Owen. To see someone being pulled apart so intensely, which honestly most everyone goes through in their life in some ways, if you're lucky you're completely pulled apart <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pull yourself together, which hopefully will be the exploration within hopefully the next season." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though {{they go to the}} darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E
500|$|Finding it {{ironic that}} Outliers {{provided}} {{suggestions on how}} to resolve cultural biases, the Sunday Times review by Kevin Jackson agreed that the book itself suffered from an unbalanced focus on American subjects, predicting that this would lead to better sales in the United States than in the United Kingdom. Jackson was disappointed in the book's lack of new ideas, noting that it merely expands on the concept that [...] "you have to be born at the right moment; at the right place; to the right family (posh usually helps); <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work really, really hard. That's about it." [...] He was also skeptical towards Gladwell's arguments for the 10,000-Hour Rule by countering that The Beatles' success {{had more to do with}} [...] "the youthful spirit of the age, the vogue for guitar bands and a spark of collaborative chemistry". Regarding the book, Paul McCartney, former member of The Beatles, said in an interview on August 6, 2010: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I feel bright," [...] said Jim. [...] "For one thing, I've got up, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{been here}} some time. You brace one. I felt that when I was very sick." ...|$|R
500|$|The album {{title is}} rooted in the idea of [...] "yielding to nature," [...] a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, [...] "I think the title Yield has to do with maybe being more {{comfortable}} within ourselves, with this band....we're all a little bit older and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me– yielding, letting something else happen and going with it." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> think, 'What are the real battles?' 'What's really important?' You get to a certain point, and it's really hard to remember what music is and to remember what drives you." ...|$|E
500|$|Among Dylan's contemporaries, Phil Ochs was {{impressed}} by Highway 61, explaining: [...] "It's {{the kind of music}} that plants a seed in your mind <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hear it several times. And as you go over it you start to hear more and more things. He's done something that's left the whole field ridiculously in the back of him." [...] In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine described Highway 61 as [...] "one of those albums that changed everything", and placed it at numberfour in its list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time". The Rolling Stone list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" [...] ranked [...] "Highway 61 Revisited", [...] "Desolation Row" [...] and [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] at number373, number187, and numberone, respectively. In 2012, The Best 100 Albums of All Time book ranked Highway 61 Revisited as the greatest album of all time. It was also included in Robert Christgau's [...] "Basic Record Library" [...] of 1960s music and Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E
500|$|Like other Disney media {{products}} {{which are}} often localized through Disney Character Voices International, Frozen was translated and dubbed into 41 languages (compared with only 15 for The Lion King). A major challenge was to find sopranos capable of matching Menzel's warm vocal tone and three-octave vocal range in their native languages. Rick Dempsey, the unit's senior executive, regarded the process of translating the film as [...] "exceptionally challenging"; he explained, [...] "It's a difficult juggling act {{to get the right}} intent of the lyrics and also have it match rhythmically to the music. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go back and adjust for lip sync! ...requires a lot of patience and precision." [...] Lopez explained that they were told by Disney to remove complex wordplay and puns from their songs, to ensure the film was easily translatable and had globally appealing lyrics. For the casting of dubbed versions, Disney required native speakers in order to [...] "ensure that the film feels 'local'." [...] They used Bell and Menzel's voices as their [...] "blueprint" [...] in casting, and tried to match the voices [...] "as much as possible," [...] meaning that they auditioned approximately 200 singers to fill the 41 slots for Elsa alone. For nearly 15 dubbed versions, they cast Elsa's singing and speaking parts separately, since not all vocalists could act the part they were singing. After casting all the other roles for all 41 languages, the international cast ended up including more than 900 people, who voiced their roles through approximately 1,300 recording sessions.|$|E

6000|$|... "She {{would not}} believe it. It has been so before, Leonardo, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been passionate, <b>and</b> pleaded your cause all over again. I have promised that I will never ask her to see you again." ...|$|R
2500|$|I think [...] {{has stated}} that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, and that's as simple as {{they want to keep}} it. They don't {{want to get into the}} nitty-gritty things such as if you bury a Scud missile to hide it from detection, there is a little thing called corrosion. Where do you hide the fuel, how do you make this stuff up, how do you align it. Because when you {{disassemble}} it, there is a process called re-alignment. There is a factory involved in that. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> test launch it to make sure that the alignment works, and that's detectable, and they haven't done that. There is a lot of common sense things that go into consideration of whether or not Iraq has a operational weapons of mass destruction capability.|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{retired from}} {{acting in the}} early 1960s and later turned down the role of Belle Rosen, a {{character}} with a crucial swimming scene, in The Poseidon Adventure. (The role eventually went to Shelley Winters.) She continued to lend her name to a line of retro women's swimwear. [...] "Women worldwide are fighting a thing called gravity," [...] said Williams. [...] "I say to women when I talk to them, 'You girls of 18 have until about 25, 30 at the most, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> report to me. My suits are quality fabric.'" [...] She went on: [...] "I {{put you in a}} suit that contains you and you will swim in. I don't want you to be in two Dixie cups and a fish line." ...|$|E
6000|$|The princess softly persisted, and he said: [...] "She {{lives in}} the East. In Chicago. It's too far off to find her. It takes five days to get down there on a cattle train, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look her up in a directory, and then trail her down. I couldn't find her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't grin, {{you little}} beast," [...] he shouted. [...] "There's nothing to laugh at. You go {{chucking}} bags that don't belong to {{you out of}} the window, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the frightful cheek to grin about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Louisa, dear," [...] said Mr Auberly, {{recovering}} from the grim smile which had indicated his appreciation of his own fireside, [...] "pour me out another cup of coffee, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better run away to bed. It is getting late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You always mean {{to manage}} everything, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no time!"

6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{you have}} to have recommendations--they won't touch you without 'em; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have about seventy-five dollars capital to start with. You got to get your coat, and your cap, and your badge, and you got to have about twenty dollars of your own to make change with, first off; company don't start you with a cent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't answer {{everything}} at once," [...] he said finally. [...] "So you'd better {{let me tell}} what I know in my own way. Big Horn Ranch is located out in Montana, and it comprises a thousand acres or more--how large I don't exactly know. To get there you journey by rail to a little jumping-off place called Four Rocks, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ride or drive to the ranch, which is four or five miles away. The nearest town of any size is Arrow Junction, which is quite a distance off." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{the little}} expanse of open shore had been fished {{over a few}} times, the trout there seemed to grow more shy, {{and there was a}} certain monotony in walking this tiny quarter-deck of space. So I went round to the west side, where the water-lilies are. Fish were rising about three yards beyond the weedy beds, and I foolishly thought I would try for them. Now, you cannot {{overestimate}} the difficulty of casting a fly across yards of water-lilies. You catch in the weeds as you lift your line for a fresh cast, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> extricate it laboriously, shortening line, and then to let it out again, and probably come to grief once more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you see {{the sides}} are not smooth; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not {{sharpened}} it uniformly. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> cut away more at the corners than <b>you</b> <b>have</b> in the middle, {{so that it is}} thicker in the middle. That is the way that boys always sharpen wedges." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir Robert, a man {{thoroughly}} {{versed in}} arts of improving money, but thoroughly honest, said to me, [...] "Madam, I am glad you {{approve of the}} method that I proposed to you; but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> begun wrong; <b>you</b> should <b>have</b> come for your interest at the half-year, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{had the money to}} put out. Now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> lost half a year's interest of £350, which is £9; for I had but 5 per cent, on the mortgage." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Stooges is over. Basically, everybody's dead except Iggy and I. So {{it would}} be sort-of ludicrous to try and tour as Iggy And The Stooges when there's only one Stooge in the band <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> side guys. That doesn't {{make any sense to}} me.|$|R
5000|$|... "Imagination" [...] {{was among}} the last songs that Tamia {{recorded}} for her debut album. Commenting on its recording process, she elaborated: [...] "When you work with Jermaine Dupri, you party on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Then you have like six hours left <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go {{in the studio and}} work." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a 2000 {{article from}} LA Weekly, in {{reference}} to how she portrays Buttercup on The Powerpuff Girls, Daily says: [...] "Spicy Buttercup is feisty. She's passionate about things, {{and a little bit}} aggressive I get to rage out every now <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be pretty contained a lot of the time, and Buttercup sometimes gets a little leaky." ...|$|E
60|$|Let it also be {{considered}} that, either in the present confusion you settle a permanent contingent, which will and must be trifling, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no effectual revenue; or you change the quota at every exigency, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> on every new repartition <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> a new quarrel.|$|R
6000|$|... “It’s {{good to be}} young. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been a man of action, and {{necessarily}} a believer in success. But I have been looking too long at life not to distrust its surprises. Age! Age! Here I stand before you a man full of doubts and hesitation—spe lentus, timidus futuri.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Forester. [...] "You only collect {{them in the}} press, {{which you}} always carry with you in your pocket.

5000|$|A {{fortnight}} later, Palentino {{was again}} {{subject to a}} protest after finishing first in the Group 1 Australian Guineas, with Tarzino's jockey Craig Newitt claiming interference with 600 metres remaining {{and again in the}} straight. This time the protest was dismissed, with stewards saying the opposing horse had also rolled towards Palentino. Jockey Mark Zahra said, [...] "It was a shame we had to go through all that because you can’t enjoy the moment <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> sweat it out. It means a lot and I said after last time, I’ll cop that as long as we win the Guineas." ...|$|E
5000|$|During his {{grade school}} years, {{he was an}} amateur {{photographer}} who developed his own film in his bathtub. While in 8th grade, he was awarded his first acting role in a film that was to star William Powell, but World War II forced the cancellation of the production. By the age of 15, he was a regular stage performer and developed an interest in film-making when he attempted to shoot his performances. In 2008, he said, [...] "I figured out {{that you have to}} move the camera around to get different angles, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> edit the film when you're done." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{is kind of}} you, however--kind and good-natured. I {{shall not}} forget it in a hurry. But <b>you</b> <b>have</b> more good nature and all that, than anybody living, I believe.
