50|$|Both {{coffee and}} tea have tannins, which is {{responsible}} for the astringent taste, but tea has nearly three times smaller tannin content than coffee. Thus, decaffeination of tea requires more care to maintain tannin content than decaffeination of coffee in order to preserve this flavor. Preserving tannins is desirable not only because of their flavor, but also because they have been shown to have anticarcinogenic, <b>antimutagenic,</b> antioxidative, and antimicrobrial properties. Specifically, tannins accelerate blood clotting, reduce blood pressure, decrease the serum lipid level, produce liver necrosis, and modulate immunoresponses.|$|E

50|$|In {{the yeast}} cell wall, mannan {{oligosaccharides}} {{are present in}} complex molecules that {{are linked to the}} protein moiety. There are two main locations of mannan oligosaccharides in the surface area of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall. They can be attached to the cell wall proteins as part of -O and -N glycosyl groups and also constitute elements of large α-D-mannanose polysaccharides (α-D-Mannans), which are built of α-(1,2)- and α-(1,3)- D-mannose branches (from 1 to 5 rings long), which are attached to long α-(1,6)-D-mannose chains. This specific combination of various functionalities involves mannan oligosacharides-protein conjugates and highly hydrophilic and structurally variable 'brush-like' mannan oligosaccharides structures that can fit to various receptors of animal digestive tracts, and to the receptors on the surface of bacterial membranes, impacts these molecules bioactivity. Mannan oligosacharides-protein conjugates are involved in interactions with the animal's immune system and as result enhance immune system activity. They also play a role in animal antioxidant and <b>antimutagenic</b> defense.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} the {{medicinal}} value of essential oils is thymol, isomeric with carvacrol and found in oil of the common spice thyme.

Thymol has been shown to act as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA in vitro.|$|E
50|$|A 2006 study {{published}} in the Journal of Experimental Therapeutics and Oncology indicated that Colostrinin may affect the aging process by reducing the spontaneous or induced mutation frequency in the DNA of cells. Such DNA damage is implicated in the general process of aging. The study, which was performed in both hamster and human cells, looked at the effect of Colostrinin on the frequency of defined DNA mutations in these cells as they occur naturally and when induced by various known chemical or physical agents. In cells stressed oxidatively, Colostrinin reduced the frequency of mutation induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to nearly background levels in a dose-dependent manner. Likewise, Colostrinin reduced the frequency of mutation caused by two mutagenic agents, methyl methane sulfonate and mitomycin-C, the latter often used in cancer chemotherapy. Notably Colostrinin decreased UVA and UVB radiation induced mutation frequency. These damaging radiations are a natural part of sunlight. UVA radiation plays a role in the induction of malignant melanoma and UVB radiation is the primary cause of squamous cell carcinomas. It is suggested that the <b>antimutagenic</b> properties of Colostrinin are achieved via multiple mechanisms - by decreasing intracellular levels of ROS and so preventing DNA damage and by increasing the efficiency of natural DNA repair mechanisms.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAntimutagenic {{activities}} of pure commercial chemicals and food supplements {{were compared with}} that of herb extracts using a method based on the umu test system for screening natural antimutagens. Of the 55 products investigated, 22 were commercial products, 12 were food supplements and 21 were aqueous and ethylic herb infusions. All commercial products showed antimtagenic properties. BHT was shown to be a very strong antimutagen. All food supplements showed medium or neutral <b>antimutagenic</b> properties, except for echinaforce and coenzyme-Q 10 which behaved as mutagenic products. All herbs showed <b>antimutagenic</b> properties except Italian parsley that had mutagenic activity. With regard to the metabolites, those from commercial products showed <b>antimutagenic</b> properties, except those from BHA and especially Biochanin A that showed high mutagenic activity. All metabolites from food supplements showed <b>antimutagenic</b> properties, except those from Fluxarola that showed <b>antimutagenic</b> properties.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{metabolic}} {{transformation of the}} monoterpenes Linalool (Lin), Myrcene (Myr) and Eucalyptol (Euc) was evaluated on their <b>antimutagenic</b> potential against t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) and 2 -nitropropane (2 NP) in E. coli WP 2 and in S. typhimurium reversion assays, respectively. Spontaneous mutagenesis was also monitored in both assays. Mammalian metabolic transformation was provided by rat liver microsomes (S 9 fraction). None of the monoterpenes was mutagenic, either with or without S 9. Results obtained without S 9 showed the <b>antimutagenic</b> potential of Lin against t-BOOH, of Myr against both t-BOOH and 2 NP, and of Euc against spontaneous and mutagenesis induced with both mutagens. Mammalian enzymes significantly reduced the <b>antimutagenic</b> effect of Lin, completely diminished the <b>antimutagenic</b> effect of Myr, but did not alter the <b>antimutagenic</b> effect of Euc. Considering the results, metabolic transformation by host enzymes could significantly influence <b>antimutagenic</b> potential and {{should be included in}} antimutagenicity studies in prokaryotic assays.

40|$|Coffee pulp (Coffea arabica) {{and peanut}} testa (Arachis hypogaea) are common {{agricultural}} wastes which are extensively studied as {{potential sources of}} bioactive compounds. This study attempted to determine the correlation of the antioxidant potential, lipid peroxidation inhibition and <b>antimutagenic</b> activities of the crude extracts of both plant samples. Quantification of phenolic compounds, flavonoids and monomeric anthocyanins and Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) analysis were performed to characterize bioactive compounds. Based from the results, peanut testa extract (PTE) exhibited higher total antioxidant capacity (TAC) compared to coffee pulp extract (CPE) at 500 μg/mL but was lower than L-Ascorbic Acid (LAA). The <b>antimutagenic</b> activity of PTE at > 125 μg/mL was higher compared to both RPE and LAA. Mitotic indices of A. cepa treated with PTE+MMS were higher compared to groups treated with RCPE+MMS, LAA+MMS, deionized water and MMS only. Correlation analysis revealed the TAC of ripe coffee pulp extract had significant moderate correlation with its <b>antimutagenic</b> activity but high correlation with LPI. The LPI of CPE showed significant moderate correlation with its <b>antimutagenic</b> activity. In PTE, TAC shows high significant correlation with its <b>antimutagenic</b> property and LPI while LPI has significant moderate correlation with its <b>antimutagenic</b> property. The observed activity of the CPE and PTE may be attributed primarily to the phenolic compounds in both plant extracts...|$|E
40|$|The {{fish meat}} of {{yellowtail}} was broiled until the surface temperature come up 260 ℃ {{before or after}} the immersing treatment in the gel-filtrated fractions of cabbage juice for 20 min at room temperature,and the effect of each fraction on mutagenicity of the broiled fish was examined by a some modified Ames's method using Salmonela typhimurium TA 98. Cabbage juice was separated into four fractions of F-I (high MW fraction), F-II (low MW fraction) - 1, 2 and 3 by a gel-filtration using Sephadex G- 25. When the fish meat was broiled after the immersing treatment in each fraction, F-I, F-II- 2 and F- II- 3 fractions showed <b>antimutagenic</b> activities, especially, F-II- 3 which is most low molecular weight fraction had a higher <b>antimutagenic</b> activity than the other fractions, and F-II- 3 heated at 100 ℃ for 20 min had also high <b>antimutagenic</b> activity. When the fish meat was immersed in F-II- 3 after broiling, F-II- 3 showed high <b>antimutagenic</b> activity, but no <b>antimutagenic</b> activity was detected when F-II- 3 was heated at 100 ℃ for 20 min. These results suggested that F-II- 3 has the <b>antimutagenic</b> activity on mutagens of charred materials produced on the surface of broiled fish and has inhibitory action on formation of mutagens in charred materials, but the former activity of F-II- 3 is unstable with the heat treatment...|$|E
40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{gastrointestinal}} model, which simulates {{the conditions in}} the human digestive tract, {{was used to determine}} potential <b>antimutagenic</b> activity of extracts of black tea and green tea. In this paper, results are presented on the availability for absorption of potential <b>antimutagenic</b> compounds present in tea and on the influence of the food matrix on this activity. Between 60 and 180 min after the tea was introduced into the model, <b>antimutagenic</b> activity was recovered from the jejunal compartment by means of dialysis: the dialysate appeared to inhibit the mutagenicity of the food mutagen MeIQx in the direct plate assay with Salmonella typhimurium (Ames test). The maximum inhibition was measured at 2 h after the start of the experiment and was comparable for black tea and green tea extract. To determine the influence of food matrices on the <b>antimutagenic</b> activity of tea, the model was loaded with black tea together with milk or a homogenized standard breakfast. The maximum inhibition observed with black tea was reduced by 22, 42 and 78 % in the presence of whole milk, semi-skimmed milk, and skimmed milk, respectively. Whole milk and skimmed milk abolished the <b>antimutagenic</b> activity of green tea by more than 90 %; for semi-skimmed milk the inhibition was more than 60 %. When a homogenized breakfast was added into the model together with the black tea extract, the <b>antimutagenic</b> activity was completely eliminated. When tea and MeIQx were added together into the digestion model, MeIQx mutagenicity was efficiently inhibited, with green tea showing a slightly stronger <b>antimutagenic</b> activity than black tea. In this case, the addition of milk had only a small inhibiting effect on the antimutagenicity. Antioxidant capacity and the concentration of catechins were also measured in the jejunal dialysates. The reduction in <b>antimutagenic</b> activity corresponded with reduction in antioxidant capacity and with a decrease of concentration of three catechins, viz. catechin, epigallocatechin gallate and epigallocatechin. The in vitro gastrointestinal model appears to be a useful tool to study the antimutagenicity of food components. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.
