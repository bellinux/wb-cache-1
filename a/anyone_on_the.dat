5|$|On 7 September 1909 two {{visitors}} were left stranded {{at the top}} of the tower as the final lift car of the night descended without them. The woman and twelve-year-old child were not noticed during the final round of inspection and so, without a way to communicate with <b>anyone</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, they spent the night on the tower until 10am the following morning. They did not appear too concerned by the ordeal and left without giving their names to officials.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the impact}} was {{far greater than}} <b>anyone</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Allied side realised, and the ramifications went far beyond New Guinea. Imperial General Headquarters had {{regarded}} the defeats in the Guadalcanal Campaign and Battle of Buna–Gona as setbacks only, and had continued to plan offensives in the South West Pacific. Now it concluded that the Japanese position was over-extended. A new defensive line was drawn running through Western New Guinea, the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands. Henceforth, positions beyond that line would be held as an outpost line. General Imamura was now charged not with winning a decisive victory, but only with holding on {{as long as possible}} so as to delay the Allied advance.|$|E

Even though the players' contract with the federation stipulated that <b>anyone</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> World Cup roster had the right to play in the tour, she did not play in any of the three games against Mexico, being replaced by Briana Scurry for the first and third matches, and Nicole Barnhart for the second. The third match against Mexico, on October 20, 2007, marked the end of the U.S. women's national team's 2007 season. The team regrouped in January 2008 to begin preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Ryan left the team after his contract was not renewed in December 2007.|$|E
5|$|When Marceau {{believes}} she has solved the murder, Poirot gathers the passengers and poses {{a series of}} questions to Marceau about the clues found. He goes on to reveal three possible solutions to Ratchett's death. The first two are identical to the novel. Poirot suggests that an assassin may have come aboard the train during the night, killed Cassetti, and then escaped the train, which is supported by evidence such as a bloodied stiletto with fingerprints that do not match <b>anyone</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> train. The second solution pieces together a number of clues showing that all of the trains' passengers and the conductor, Pierre Michel, are responsible for the murder, to which they confess.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} The 3rd Birthday was {{composed}} by Mitsuto Suzuki and Tsuyoshi Sekito, with additional work by Yoko Shimomura. Shimomura was involved {{from an early}} stage, when The 3rd Birthday was still a mobile game. When she was originally asked to compose for the title, she was involved {{with a number of}} other projects which made handling the entire score difficult. When asked whether she wanted to work with <b>anyone</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> composition, she suggested Suzuki and Sekito. The general instruction was to follow the pattern used by the music for Parasite Eve, with Suzuki and Sekito handling the majority of tracks, going so far as referring to the songs from the original Parasite Eve when handling remixes of old themes. In keeping with the game's other development goals, Shimomura wanted to alter some of the established music, although she asked the team to include familiar themes from earlier games for fans. When she started out, she knew nothing about the game's story, but became familiar with it later in development and also found the project less challenging than she initially anticipated. Suzuki was responsible for a large amount of track mixing. Sekito was mostly involved with choosing and helping with instrumentation, in particular whether to include symphonic music. The composers had a relatively high degree of freedom, but they also had problems when composing some tracks that did not fit into selected scenes.|$|E

25|$|Janković {{became the}} world no. 1 {{again during the}} fall {{in the midst of}} winning three {{consecutive}} tournaments. At the China Open, Janković defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova in two sets to win the title. The following week, Janković played in the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Germany, where she defeated Venus Williams in the semifinals and Nadia Petrova in the final. In the Kremlin Cup in Moscow, Janković defeated defending champion Dementieva in the semifinals before triumphing against Vera Zvonareva in the final for her third title in three weeks, the first time for a player on the WTA tour to do so since 2005. As the top seed at the year-end 2008 WTA Tour Championships held in Doha, Qatar, Janković won two of her three round-robin matches, including only the second win of her career over Ivanovic.

After three more victories by margins of 10 points or more, the Wildcats began play in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) on January 8, 1966, at Florida.
