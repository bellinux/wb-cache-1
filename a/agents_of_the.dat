5|$|The {{announcement}} of the result was marred by a two-hour-long delay because of arguments over the discrepancies of the postal votes by Pakatan Rakyat election <b>agents.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 2,827 ballot papers issued for postal votes, BN won 2,323 votes (82.2%), DAP won 70 (2.4%), the independent won 36 (1.2%) while 208 (7.3%) were considered spoilt.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of the {{operation}} began soon after Árbenz's resignation on June 27, 1954, with several agents being dispatched to Guatemala beginning on July 4. These included <b>agents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CIA and the Office of Intelligence Research (OIR). The first phase involved the collection of 150,000 documents from sources including Árbenz's personal possessions, trade union offices, and police agencies. The ruling military junta led by Carlos Castillo Armas aided these efforts. Following a presentation made to US President Dwight Eisenhower on July 20, a decision was taken to accelerate the operation, and the number of people working in Guatemala was increased. The new team members posed as unaffiliated with the US government to maintain plausible deniability. The operation helped set up the Guatemalan National Committee of Defense Against Communism, which was covertly funded by the CIA: <b>agents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> committee became involved in PBHistory. The team studied over 500,000 documents in total, and finished processing documents on 28 September 1954.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of small vessels {{from all over the}} south of England were pressed into service to aid in the Dunkirk evacuation. They {{included}} speedboats, Thames vessels, car ferries, pleasure craft, and many other types of small craft. The most useful proved to be the motor lifeboats, which had a reasonably good capacity and speed. Some boats were requisitioned without the owner's knowledge or consent. <b>Agents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ministry of Shipping, accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely looking vessels, had them checked for seaworthiness, and took them downriver to Sheerness, where naval crews were to be placed aboard. Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.|$|E

5|$|At Easter, 1151, Theobald {{took over}} the {{management}} of the chapter's estates, as the new prior, Walter Parvus, was not up to the task. At first, there were no disputes, but soon the monks felt that Theobald was cheating them and imposing too rigorous a definition of poverty, and asked that the stewardship of the estates be restored to Parvus. Theobald refused and the monks attempted to appeal to the papacy. Their envoys, however, were caught by <b>agents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> archbishop and the appeal went nowhere. Theobald then deposed Parvus and appointed a new prior. Theobald's relations with the monks after this point seem to have been without incident.|$|E

5|$|Hearings began September 27, 1918, {{shortly before}} the end of World War I. Nearly four dozen {{witnesses}} testified. Many were <b>agents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bureau of Investigations (BOI), the predecessor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The agents, controversially and usually erroneously, implicated high-profile American citizens as pro-German, using the fallacy of guilt by association. For example, the Bureau chief labeled some people pro-German because they had insubstantial and non-ideological acquaintance with German agents. Others were accused because their names were discovered in the notebooks of suspected German agents, of whom they had never heard.|$|E

5|$|In 1623, Kepler at last {{completed}} the Rudolphine Tables, {{which at the}} time was considered his major work. However, due to the publishing requirements of the emperor and negotiations with Tycho Brahe's heir, it would not be printed until 1627. In the meantime, religious tension — the root of the ongoing Thirty Years' War — once again put Kepler and his family in jeopardy. In 1625, <b>agents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Counter-Reformation placed most of Kepler's library under seal, and in 1626 the city of Linz was besieged. Kepler moved to Ulm, where he arranged for the printing of the Tables at his own expense.|$|E
5|$|In 726 Asad {{rebuilt the}} city of Balkh, which had been {{destroyed}} by Qutayba ibn Muslim following a revolt, and transferred there the Arab garrison troops from nearby Barukhan. Asad also resumed, after almost a decade, the practice of sending envoys to the Chinese court. This move was clearly linked to the Turgesh threat, as the Turks were Chinese vassals and were regarded by the Transoxianians as the <b>agents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese emperor, sent to deliver them from Arab rule. Asad is also said to have built the village of Asadabad near Nishapur, which his descendants held until Tahirid times.|$|E

5|$|In early May, Damjanović led most of {{the troops}} under his command into northwestern Italy, where they {{surrendered}} to the British and were placed in detention camps. Many were extradited to Yugoslavia, where between 1,500 and 3,100 were executed by the Partisans and buried in mass graves in the Kočevski Rog plateau. Others immigrated to western countries, where they established émigré organizations intended to promote Zbor's political agenda. Many of Ljotić's followers settled in Munich, where they ran their own publishing house and printed a newspaper called Iskra (Spark). In 1974, Ljotić's brother {{was shot and killed}} by <b>agents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yugoslav State Security Service (Uprava državne bezbednosti, UDBA). The antagonism between pro-Ljotić groups and those affiliated with the Chetniks continued in exile.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a {{paramilitary}} {{group known as}} Combat 18 (C18) was formed to protect BNP events from anti-fascist protesters. Tyndall was displeased that by 1992, C18 was having an increased influence over the BNP's street activities. Relations between the groups deteriorated such that by August 1993, activists from the BNP and C18 were physically fighting each other. In December 1993, Tyndall issued a bulletin to BNP branches declaring C18 to be a proscribed organisation, furthermore suggesting {{that it may have}} been established by <b>agents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state to discredit the party. To counter C18's influence, he secured the American white nationalist militant William Pierce as a guest speaker at the BNP's annual rally in November 1995.|$|E

They and their weapons reached the island on 31 May. Grbić passed the terrorists and their weapons to the <b>agents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Serbian Narodna Odbrana for transport into Austro-Hungarian territory and from safe-house to safe-house. Princip and Grabež crossed into Austria-Hungary on the evening of 1 June. Princip and Grabež and the weapons were passed from agent to agent until on 3 June they arrived in Tuzla. They left the weapons in the hands of the Narodna Odbrana agent Miško Jovanović and rejoined Čabrinović.|$|E
5|$|One {{probable}} {{reason for}} the British clergy's refusal {{to cooperate with the}} Gregorian missionaries was the ongoing conflict between the natives and the Anglo-Saxons, who still were encroaching upon British lands {{at the time of the}} mission. The British were unwilling to preach to the invaders of their country, and the invaders saw the natives as second-class citizens, and would have been unwilling to listen to any conversion efforts. There was also a political dimension, as the missionaries could be seen as <b>agents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> invaders; because Augustine was protected by Æthelberht, submitting to Augustine would have been seen as submitting to Æthelberht's authority, which the British bishops would have been unwilling to do.|$|E
