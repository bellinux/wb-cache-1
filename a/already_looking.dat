5|$|In August, several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals {{proposed}} {{the imposition of}} martial law, ostensibly {{to break up the}} demonstrations, but in reality to prepare for a military coup. However, Nhu, <b>already</b> <b>looking</b> to arrest Buddhist leaders and crush the protest movement, used the opportunity to preempt the generals and embarrass them. He disguised Tung's Special Forces in army uniforms and used them to attack the Buddhists, thereby causing the general public and South Vietnam's U.S. allies to blame the army, diminishing the generals' reputations and ability to act as future national leaders.|$|E

In 1936, BMC with a subsidiary of Associated Lead Manufactures Ltd. formed The Basinghall Mining Syndicate Ltd. to explore the possibility of purchasing Greenside, believing it had only failed {{from a lack of}} working capital.|$|E
25|$|Assistant Secretary Bard was {{convinced}} that a standard bombardment and naval blockade {{would be enough to}} force Japan into surrendering. Even more, he had seen signs for weeks that the Japanese were actually <b>already</b> <b>looking</b> for {{a way out of the}} war. His idea was for the United States to tell the Japanese about the bomb, the impending Soviet entry into the war, and the fair treatment that citizens and the Emperor would receive at the coming Big Three conference. Before the bombing occurred, Bard pleaded with Truman to neither drop the bombs (at least not without warning the population first) nor to invade the entire country, proposing to stop the bloodshed.|$|E

In those days, marriages were performed while the bride and groom were very young, and Shamshad's parents were <b>already</b> <b>looking</b> out for a suitable alliance for her. Their efforts {{were on the verge of}} bearing fruit in 1934 when Ganpat Lal Batto and Shamshad made the decision to marry each other.

25|$|As {{early as}} the 1870s, state and federal {{agencies}} were <b>already</b> <b>looking</b> at the Central Valley as an area in need of a large water transport project. In 1931 California came up with the State Water Plan, which entailed the construction of dams and canals to transport water from the Sacramento River to the rapidly dwindling San Joaquin. The project was still in its planning stages when the Great Depression hit the United States, and California was unable to raise the funds necessary for building the various facilities. As a result the project was transferred to the federal government and switched hands several times between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) before finally being authorized in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1937 as a USBR undertaking and part of the New Deal, a series of large-scale reforms and construction projects intended to provide jobs for the millions of unemployed during the Depression.|$|E

[...] He further stated: [...] "We did it and I am very happy for the team {{because we had a}} really strong weekend and it feels great to win in this fashion." [...] Lotterer said of the result: [...] "It's no holds barred all the time and is very fun, especially at Spa-Francorchamps. It's for this type of race that we hit track." [...] Dumas, who finished in second alongside Lieb and Jani, stated he found driving in dry weather conditions difficult because he was not experienced participating in such conditions. Lieb said his battle with Tréluyer was [...] "great" [...] and said the contact between the two drivers was part of motor racing. Jani stated while he did not win the race he praised his car. Third-place co-finisher Webber said that his team had [...] "too many own goals" [...] and that they did not wanted to be [...] "gifted results" [...] if they were not performing at the highest level. Bernhard said that despite taking the stop-and-go penalty his team did not give up and gave it their best effort to stand on the podium.|$|E
500|$|In 1969, the Greek {{military}} junta agreed to procure {{a total of}} 190 AMX-30s and 14 AMX-30Ds, making Greece the first foreign nation to purchase the French tank. Throughout the 1960s, Spain had considered both the AMX-30 and the Leopard 1 to complement their existing fleet of M47 and M48 Patton tanks. Ultimately, Spain opted for the AMX-30 {{for a variety of}} reasons, including British unwillingness to sell the L7 tank gun to a fascist regime and the French offer to allow the AMX-30 to be manufactured in Spain. Spain ordered 19 tanks in 1970, and later agreed to manufacture another 180 tanks in Spain. In 1979, Spain began the production of a second batch of 100 tanks, completing a total of 299 AMX-30s issued to the Spanish Army; these were designated AMX-30Es. Spain also procured 10 AMX-30Ds and 18 AMX-30Rs. As production of the AMX-30E ended in 1979, the Spanish Army was <b>already</b> <b>looking</b> for a modernization program {{to improve the quality of}} the tank's mobility. In 1987, the Spanish Army began a six-year modernization program which brought 150 tanks up to AMX-30EM2 standards and modified another 149 tanks to AMX-30EM1 standards. The former was a much more complete upgrade, which saw improvements to the tank's mobility through the adoption of a new engine and gearbox, as well as to the tank's firepower, with the development of a new kinetic energy penetrator and the introduction of a far more complex and accurate fire control system for the tank's gunner, amongst other things. The AMX-30EM1 was termed a [...] "reconstruction" [...] and only saw improvements to the tank's mobility by adopting a new transmission and renovating much of the vehicle's worn out systems, such as the brakes, indicators and controls. These rebuilt AMX-30s were soon replaced by M60 Patton tanks procured from the United States in the early 1990s, while its fleet of AMX-30EM2s was later replaced by the B1 Centauro anti-tank vehicle.|$|E

In May, a decade after their arrival in Indiana, the Harmonists purchased land along the Ohio River eighteen miles from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and were making arrangements to advertise the sale of their property in Indiana. The move, although it was made primarily for religious reasons, would provide the Harmonists with easier access to eastern markets and {{a place where they}} could live more peacefully with others who shared their German language and culture. On May 24, 1824, a group of Harmonists boarded a steamboat and departed Indiana, bound for Pennsylvania, where they founded the community of Economy, the present-day town of Ambridge.
