During this 18-year period, about 40 other solar and lunar eclipses take place, but with a somewhat different geometry. One saros equaling 18.03 years is not equal to a perfect integer number of lunar orbits (earth revolutions with respect to the fixed stars of 27.32166 days sidereal month), therefore, even though the relative geometry of the Earth–Sun–Moon system will be nearly identical after a saros, the Moon will be in a slightly different position with respect to the stars for each eclipse in a Saros series.

40|$|It {{is known}} that, in the weak-field and slow-motion {{approximation}} of general relativity, the stationary {{component of the}} gravitational field of a rotating body, proportional to its angular momentum, is able to discriminate between the opposite directions of motion {{of a pair of}} counter-orbiting tests particles moving along geometrically identical paths: it is the so-called gravitomagnetic clock effect. In this paper, we show that, to the first post-Newtonian level, there is also a gravitolectric clock effect induced by the static component of the gravitational field of a non-rotating body. Indeed, the difference of the draconitic periods of two test particles moving in opposite directions along identical quasi-circular orbits turns out to be non-vanishing. It depends on the shape, the size and the pericenter location of the orbit, but it is independent of the initial position along it. On the contrary, the gravitoelectric corrections to the <b>anomalistic</b> <b>periods</b> {{turn out to be the}} same for both prograde and retrograde orbital motions. For a hypothetical pair of Earth satellites in Supertundra-like orbits, the gravitoelectric draconitic clock effect could be as large as 46 μs, while a Juno-like orbital configuration around Jupiter would allow to reach about 0. 01 s.

Expressed as 29days + 12hours + 793/1080hours this value has been used later in the Hebrew calendar. The Chaldeans also knew that 251 synodic months ≈ 269 anomalistic months. [...] Hipparchus used the multiple of this period by a factor of 17, because that interval is also an eclipse period, and is also close to an integer number of years (4267 moons : 4573 <b>anomalistic</b> <b>periods</b> : 4630.53 nodal periods : 4611.98 lunar orbits : 344.996 years : 344.982 solar orbits : 126,007.003 days : 126,351.985 rotations). What was so exceptional and useful about the cycle was that all 345-year-interval eclipse pairs occur slightly over 126,007 days apart within a tight range of only about ±1/2 hour, guaranteeing (after division by 4267) an estimate of the synodic month correct to one part in order of magnitude 10 million.

40|$|Abstract. We present new {{spectroscopic data}} and {{physical}} parameters for the early-type binary system β Sco A. Radial velocity measurements of Reticon spectra {{have been made}} using both cross-correlation and disentangling techniques. Spectroscopic orbits, based on the new data and published radial velocities are presented. The orbital period and apsidal motion rate have been refined using 603 radial velocities covering a time interval of 84 years. The <b>anomalistic</b> <b>period</b> is 6. 828245 ± 0. 000009 days, and the apsidal motion rate is ˙ω = 0. 00131 ± 0. 00004 degrees per day. The first visual-spectroscopic orbit for the system is given here as well, from which we derive a parallax for the system of 0. ′ ′ 0070 ± 0. ′ ′ 0001 corresponding to a distance of 143 ± 3 pc. This has allowed us to compute the absolute dimensions and mean internal structure constant for the system. We find, for the primary and secondary respectively, masses, radii, and effective temperatures of: mp/m ⊙ = 13. 5 ± 0. 9, ms/m ⊙ = 9. 6 ± 0. 4, rp/r ⊙ = 6. 8 ± 0. 4, rs/r ⊙ = 4. 2 ± 0. 3, Tp = 28000 ± 2000 K, and Ts = 26400 ± 2000 K. The corresponding spectral types of the components are B 0. 5 IV-V and B 1. 5 V. Line photometry produced from the disentangling solutions suggests the presence of eclipses in β Sco A, which must be verified through systematic photometry.

50|$|The saros, {{a period}} of 6585.3211 days (14 common years + 4 leap years + 11.321 days, or 13 common years + 5 leap years + 10.321 days), is useful for {{predicting}} the times at which nearly identical eclipses will occur. Three periodicities related to lunar orbit, the synodic month, the draconic month, and the anomalistic month coincide almost perfectly each saros cycle. For an eclipse to occur, either the Moon must be located between the Earth and Sun (for a solar eclipse) or the Earth must be located between the Sun and Moon (for a lunar eclipse). This can happen only when the Moon is new or full, respectively, and repeat occurrences of these lunar phases result from solar and lunar orbits producing the Moon's synodic period of 29.53059 days. During most full and new moons, however, {{the shadow of the}} Earth or Moon falls to the north or south of the other body. Eclipses occur when the three bodies form a nearly straight line. Because the plane of the lunar orbit is inclined to that of the earth, this condition occurs only when a full or new Moon is near or in the ecliptic plane, that is when the moon is at one of the two nodes (the ascending or descending node). The period of time for two successive lunar passes through the ecliptic plane (returning to the same node) is termed the draconic month, a 27.21222 day period. The three-dimensional geometry of an eclipse, when the new or full moon is near one of the nodes, occurs every 5 or 6 months when the Sun is in conjunction or opposition to the Moon and coincidentally also near a node of the Moon's orbit at that time, or twice per eclipse year. Two Saros eclipses have the same appearance and duration due to the distance between the Earth and Moon being nearly the same for each event because the Saros eclipse cycle is also an integer of the <b>anomalistic</b> month, the <b>period</b> of the eccentricity of lunar orbit, 27.5545 days.After one saros, the Moon will have completed roughly an integer number of lunar orbit cycles and synodic, draconic, and <b>anomalistic</b> <b>periods</b> (241, 223, 242, and 239) and the Earth-Sun-Moon geometry will be nearly identical: the Moon will have the same phase and be at the same node and the same distance from the Earth.

Given the date of an eclipse, one saros later a nearly identical eclipse can be predicted. During this 18-year period, about 40 other solar and lunar eclipses take place, but with a somewhat different geometry. One saros equaling 18.03 years is not equal to a perfect integer number of lunar orbits (earth revolutions with respect to the fixed stars of 27.32166 days sidereal month), therefore, even though the relative geometry of the Earth-Sun-Moon system will be nearly identical after a saros, the Moon will be in a slightly different position with respect to the stars for each eclipse in a Saros series. The axis of rotation of the Earth-Moon system exhibits a precession period of 18.59992 years.|$|R
50|$|The second {{precession}} {{is that of}} {{the major}} axis of the Moon's elliptical orbit (the line of the apsides from perigee to apogee), which precesses eastward by 360 degrees in approximately 8.85 years. This is the reason that an <b>anomalistic</b> month (the <b>period</b> of time that the Moon moves from the perigee to the apogee and to the perigee again) is longer than the sidereal month (the period of time when the Moon completes one revolution with respect to the fixed stars). This apsidal precession completes one rotation in {{the same time as the}} number of sidereal months exceeds the number of anomalistic months by exactly one, after about 3233 days (8.85 years).|$|R
40|$|The {{orbital motion}} of a binary system is {{characterized}} by various characteristic temporal intervals which, by definition, are different from each other: the draconitic, <b>anomalistic</b> and sidereal <b>periods.</b> They all coincide in the Keplerian case. Such a degeneracy is removed, in general, when a post-Keplerian acceleration is present. We analytically work out the corrections to such otherwise Keplerian periods which are induced by general relativity (Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring) and, at the Newtonian level, by the quadrupole of the primary. In many astronomical and astrophysical systems, like exoplanets, {{one of the most}} accurately determined quantities is just the time span characterizing the orbital revolution, which is often measured independently with different techniques like the transit photometry and the radial velocities. Thus, our results could be useful, in principle, to either constrain the physical properties of the central body and/or perform new tests of general relativity, especially when no other standard observables like, e. g., the orbital precessions are accessible to observations. The difference of two independently measured periods would cancel out the common Keplerian term leaving just a post-Keplerian correction. Furthermore, by comparing the theoretically predicted post-Keplerian expressions T^(pK) with the experimental accuracy σ_T_exp in measuring the orbital period(s) it is possible to identify those systems whose observations should be re-processed with genuine post-Keplerian models if T^(pK) >σ_T_exp. It seems just the case for WASP- 33 b since σ_T_exp= 0. 04 s, while 3 s≤ T_dra^(J_ 2) ≤ 9. 5 s, T_dra^(GE) = 0. 36 s. Comment: LaTex 2 e, 8 pages, no figures, no tables.
