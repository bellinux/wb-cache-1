5|$|Numerous {{copper alloys}} have been formulated, many with {{important}} uses. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Bronze usually refers to copper-tin alloys, but {{can refer to}} any alloy of copper such as <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronze.</b> Copper {{is one of the}} most important constituents of silver and carat gold and carat solders used in the jewelry industry, modifying the color, hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys. Some lead-free solders consist of tin alloyed with a small proportion of copper and other metals.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, bronze 5 centavos and {{cupro-nickel}} 10 and 20 centavos were introduced, followed, in 1924, by bronze 10 and 20 centavos and <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronze</b> 50 centavos and 1 escudo. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>bronze</b> {{was replaced}} with cupro-nickel in 1927.|$|E
25|$|Metals include <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronze,</b> silver, {{gold and}} {{bi-metal}} coins. Nugget coins are issued in ounces and fractions or kilograms {{and come in}} gold and platinum, some are denominated in dollars others only their weight value.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to summarise the microstructural changes which {{take place in}} <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronzes</b> during heat treatment. Another objective {{of this study was}} to map the potential of a certain type of <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronzes</b> for undergoing martensitic transformation. The methods, which were chosen for assessing the results of heat treatment with regard to their availability, included measurement of hardness and observation of microstructure using light and scanning electron microscopy, Additional tools for evaluation of microstructure comprised measurement of microhardness and chemical analysis by EDS. An important part of the experiment is observation of microstructural changes in the Jominy bar during the end-quench test. Upon completing experiments of this kind, one can define the heat treatment conditions necessary for obtaining optimum properties. In addition, the paper presents important findings on how to improve the corrosion resistance of <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronzes</b> by special heat treatment sequences...|$|R
25|$|On 11 February 1991, $1 and $2 coins were {{introduced}} to replace the $1 and $2 notes in circulation. These coins were minted in <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronze,</b> and were the first New Zealand coins to be minted to metric specifications.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, {{the last}} {{substantial}} issue of silver coins was made, whilst, in 1939, moves {{to reduce the}} cost of the coinage led to copper being replaced by <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronze</b> and nickel by stainless steel. All issuance of coinage came to a halt in 1943.|$|E
25|$|The 5, 10, 20 and 50 cent coins {{are made}} of cupronickel (75 percent copper and 25 percent nickel). The one and two dollar coins {{are made of}} <b>{{aluminium}}</b> <b>bronze</b> (92 percent copper, 6 per cent aluminium and 2 per cent nickel). The two dollar, one dollar, 50 and 20 cent circulating coins occasionally feature commemorative designs.|$|E
50|$|Dissolution of {{base metals}} can cause {{detrimental}} {{changes in the}} brazing alloy. For example, aluminium dissolved from <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronzes</b> can embrittle the braze; addition of nickel to the braze can offset this.|$|R
50|$|Another notable {{property}} of <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronzes</b> are their biostatic effects. The copper {{component of the}} alloy prevents colonization by marine organisms including algae, lichens, barnacles, and mussels, and therefore can be preferable to stainless steel or other non-cupric alloys in applications where such colonization would be unwanted.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, fifty satang coin was minted both old <b>aluminium</b> series <b>bronze</b> and new copper series.|$|R
25|$|The first {{circulating}} United States coins were cents (pennies), {{produced in}} 1793, and made entirely from copper. Silver content was reduced in many coins in the 19th century (use of billon), {{and the first}} coins made entirely of base metal (e.g. nickel, cupronickel, <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronze),</b> representing values higher than {{the value of their}} metal, were minted in the mid 19th century.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, {{coins in}} {{denominations}} of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 santeem, and 1 dinar were introduced, with the 1, 2 and 5 santeem struck in aluminium, the 10, 20 and 50 santeem in <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronze</b> and the 1 dinar in cupro-nickel. The obverses showed {{the emblem of}} Algeria, while the reverses carried the values in Eastern Arabic numerals. In later decades, coins were issued sporadically with various commemorative subjects. However, the 1 and 2 santeem were not struck again, whilst the 5, 10 and 20 santeem were last struck in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the Ministry of Finance and the Royal Thai Mint {{announced}} the 2009 coin series, which included changes in materials to reduce production costs {{as well as}} an update of the image on the obverse to a more recent portrait of the king. The two-baht coin, confusingly similar in color and size to the one-baht coin, was changed from nickel-clad low-carbon steel to <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronze.</b> New two-baht coin {{was the first of the}} new series released on February 3, 2009, followed by a satang coin in April, a five-baht coin in May, a ten-baht coin in June, and a one-baht coin in July 2009.|$|E

2500|$|In 1974, the [...] "Ang Bagong Lipunan" [...] ("The New Society") series, was {{introduced}} with the ₱5 coins included. <b>Aluminium</b> replaced <b>bronze</b> and cupro-nickel replaced nickel-brass that year.|$|R
25|$|There are {{presently}} two series of coins in circulation: <b>aluminium,</b> <b>bronze</b> and nickel coins dated between 1991 and 2010. These come in denominations of 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 rupiah. The older series of coins has been gradually disappearing. Due {{to the low}} value and general shortage of small denomination coins (below 100 rupiah), {{it is common to}} have amounts rounded up (or down) or to receive sweets in lieu of the last few rupiah of change in supermarkets and stores.. A new series of coins featuring Indonesia's national heroes were issued in 2016 in denominations of 100-, 200-, 500 and 1000 rupiah.|$|E
25|$|The {{series is}} {{therefore}} {{divided into three}} sequences, {{each with its own}} metal colour. This division into colours has its roots in history. In earlier times, the value of the coins was equivalent to the value of the metal from which they were minted: gold was used for the coins of the highest denominations, silver for the next-highest, and copper for the lowest coin denominations. This correlation between colour and value has been retained in the present coin series (see examples to the right). The 50-øre coins are thus minted from copper-coloured bronze, the 1-, 2- and 5-krone coins from a silver-coloured cupronickel alloy, and the 10- and 20-krone coins from golden <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronze.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1941, {{a series}} of silver coins was {{introduced}} in denominations of 5, 10, and 20 satang, due to a shortage of nickel caused by World War II. The next year, tin coins were introduced for 1, 5, and 10 satang, followed by 20 satang in 1945 and 25 and 50 satang in 1946. In 1950, aluminium-bronze 5, 10, 25, and 50 satang were introduced whilst, in 1957, bronze 5 and 10 satang were issued, along with 1 baht coins struck in an unusual alloy of copper, nickel, silver, and zinc. Several Thai coins were issued for many years without changing the date. These include the tin 1942 1 satang and the 1950 5 and 10 satang, struck until 1973, the tin 1946 25 satang struck until 1964, the tin 50 satang struck until 1957, and the <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronze</b> 1957 5, 10, 25, and 50 satang struck until the 1970s. Cupronickel 1 baht coins were introduced in 1962 and struck without date change until 1982.|$|E

40|$|With the {{increase}} in wall thickness of the casting of iron-nickel-aluminium-bronze, by {{the reduction of the}} cooling rate the size of κII phase precipitates increases. This process, in the case of complex <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronzes</b> with additions of Cr, Mo and W is increased. Crystalliza-tion of big κII phase, during slow cooling of the casting, reduces the concentration of additives introduced to the bronze matrix and hard-ness. Undertaken research to develop technology of thick-walled products (g> 6 mm) of complex <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronzes.</b> Particular attention was paid to the metallurgy of granules. As a result, a large cooling speed of the alloy, and also high-speed solidification casting a light weight of the granules allows: to avoid micro-and macrosegregation, decreasing the particle size, increase the dispersion of phases in multiphase alloys. Depending on the size granules as possible is to provide finished products with a wall thickness greater than 6 mm by infiltration of liquid alloy of granules (composites). Preliminary studies was conducted using drip method granulate of CuAl 10 Fe 5 Ni 5 bronze melted in a INDUTHERM-VC 500 D Vacuum Pressure Casting Machine. This bronze is a starting alloy for the preparation of the complex <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronzes</b> with additions of Cr, Mo, W and C or Si. Optimizations of granulation process was carried out. As the pro-cess control parameters taken a casting temperature t (°C) and the path h (mm) of free-fall of the metal droplets in the surrounding atmos-phere before it is intensively cooled in a container of water.

50|$|<b>Aluminium</b> <b>bronzes</b> {{are most}} valued for their higher {{strength}} and corrosion resistance {{as compared to}} other bronze alloys. These alloys are tarnish-resistant and show low rates of corrosion in atmospheric conditions, low oxidation rates at high temperatures, and low reactivity with sulfurous compounds and other exhaust products of combustion. They are also resistant to corrosion in sea water. Aluminium bronzes' resistance to corrosion results from the aluminium in the alloys, which reacts with atmospheric oxygen to form a thin, tough surface layer of alumina (aluminium oxide) which acts {{as a barrier to}} corrosion of the copper-rich alloy. The addition of tin can improve corrosion resistance.|$|R
25|$|In 2003, the Banco de Mexico {{began the}} gradual {{launch of a}} new series of {{bimetallic}} $100 coins. These number 32 – one for each of the nation's 31 states, plus the Federal District. While the obverse of these coins bears the traditional coat of arms of Mexico, their reverses show the individual coats of arms of the component states. The first states to be celebrated in this fashion were Zacatecas, Yucatán, Veracruz, and Tlaxcala. In circulation they are extraordinarily rare, but their novelty value offsets the unease most users feel at having such a large amount of money in a single coin. Although the Bank has tried to encourage users to collect full sets of these coins, issuing special display folders for the purpose, the high cost involved has worked against them. Bullion versions of these coins are also available, with the outer ring made of gold, instead of <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronze.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, coins {{of the new}} {{currency}} (dated 1992) {{were issued}} in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 centavos, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 nuevos pesos. The 5 and 10 centavos were minted in stainless steel and the 20 and 50 centavos in <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronze.</b> The nuevo peso denominations were bimetallic, with the 1, 2 and 5 nuevos pesos having <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronze</b> centers and stainless steel rings, and the 10, 20 and 50 nuevos pesos having [...]925 silver centers and <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronze</b> rings.|$|E
2500|$|The {{circulating}} and non-circulating commemoratives may {{be issued}} jointly, but have quite different purposes. Denmark, for instance, has since 1990 developed {{a pattern of}} issuing <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronze</b> 20 kroner commemoratives and accompanying silver 200 krone commemoratives. The <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronze</b> coins are circulating along with the non-commemorative 20 krone coins, while the silver coins are never circulated. The circulating commemoratives brings variation into the circulating coin mass, while the silver coins are collectors items {{and a source of}} revenue for the state. Likewise, in East Germany, some commemorative coins were issued with a primary purpose of earning foreign currency, while others actually circulated, albeit in smaller quantity than the bank notes of the corresponding denominations.|$|E
40|$|This is a {{copper-aluminium}} bronze containing 10 wt% aluminium. A {{small amount}} of iron is often added {{to act as a}} grain refiner to improve the mechanical properties. Alloys with more than 8 wt% aluminium solidify as the β phase. Below about 930 °C, Widmanstätten α phase precipitates. At the eutectoid temperature (565 °C) the remaining β decomposes to a lamellar eutectoid of α and β. Rapid cooling from the high temperature β phase can form martensite instead of Widmanstätten α. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>bronzes</b> have high strength, corrosion resistance and good high temperature properties (up to 300 - 400 °C). Typical applications include bearings, gears and corrosion resistant vessels. ...|$|R
25|$|The new markka coinage {{consisted}} initially of six denominations: 1 (<b>bronze,</b> later <b>aluminium),</b> 5 (<b>bronze,</b> later <b>aluminium),</b> 10 (aluminium-bronze, later aluminium), 20 and 50 penniä (aluminium-bronze) and 1 markka (silver, later cupro-nickel).

25|$|Aluminium oxide is {{responsible}} for the resistance of metallic aluminium to weathering. Metallic aluminium is very reactive with atmospheric oxygen, and a thin passivation layer of aluminium oxide (4nm thickness) forms on any exposed aluminium surface. This layer protects the metal from further oxidation. The thickness and properties of this oxide layer can be enhanced using a process called anodising. A number of alloys, such as <b>aluminium</b> <b>bronzes,</b> exploit this property by including a proportion of aluminium in the alloy to enhance corrosion resistance. The aluminium oxide generated by anodising is typically amorphous, but discharge assisted oxidation processes such as plasma electrolytic oxidation result in a significant proportion of crystalline aluminium oxide in the coating, enhancing its hardness.|$|R
