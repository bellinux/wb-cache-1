All pupils must have gained a selective place through the Eleven Plus and placed The Judd School as a preference on their application form. Because the school is usually over-subscribed, priority is given to students in Local Authority Care in the first instance. Students are then ranked according to their aggregate scores in the Eleven Plus, and the distance from a students home to the school (<b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crow</b> <b>flies)</b> is used as a tiebreaker.|$|E
5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crow</b> <b>flies,</b> but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E

50|$|Crowflight {{missions}} {{were initially}} flown from Ramey AFB, Puerto Rico (Det 3), and Plattsburgh AFB, New York (Det 4). The U-2 aircraft {{being used in}} these Crowflight missions were designated as WU-2A's which carried some of the sampling equipment in the aircraft nose. This resulted in the nose being flat at the tip to accommodate the sampling device. Further sampling inlets were carried {{on the port side}} {{just in front of the}} Nose wheel well. Filter membranes were placed inside these units and after flying though the radioactive clouds the membranes were sent for analysis. From this test the strength and make up of the Nuclear device could be determined. Aircraft flew in a Straight line, North to South and then reversed course, hence the mission name of Crowflight (<b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crow</b> <b>fly's).</b>|$|R
50|$|On March 7, 2009 (sol 1,820), Opportunity first imaged {{the rim of}} Endeavour after driving about 3.2 km {{since it}} left Victoria in August 2008. Opportunity also imaged Iazu crater, which is about 38 km away and about 7 km in diameter. At that time, Opportunity was 12 km from Endeavour <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Martian <b>crow</b> <b>flies,</b> but to avoid hazards, it was {{estimated}} that it would take about 30% more driving distance than that to reach Endeavour. Based on the amount of time it had taken to drive from Victoria, {{it was estimated that}} this journey would take over one Martian year (23 months). On May 5, 2010, to avoid hazardous dune fields along the direct path between Victoria and Endeavour, the charted route between the two craters was extended to an estimated 19 kilometers.|$|R

It is true that Christian did here meet with Apollyon, with whom he had also a sore combat; but that fray was the fruit of those slips that he got in his going down the hill; for they that get slips there, must look for combats here. And hence it is that this valley has got so hard a name. For the common people, when they hear that some frightful thing has befallen such a one in such a place, are of an opinion that that place is haunted with some foul fiend or evil spirit; when, alas! it is for the fruit of their doing that such things do befall them there. This Valley of Humiliation is of itself as {{fruitful}} a place <b>as</b> any <b>the</b> <b>crow</b> <b>flies</b> over; and I am persuaded, if we could hit upon it, we might find, somewhere hereabouts, something that might give us an account why Christian was so hardly beset in this place." ...|$|R

25|$|The longest qanat was the 94km long Gadara Aqueduct in {{northern}} Jordan.

Only 35km long <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crow</b> <b>flies,</b> its length was almost tripled by following closely the contours of the local topography, avoiding valleys and mountain ridges alike. The monumental work seemed to be carried out in seven stages of construction between 130 and 193AD. The distance between the individual vertical shafts was on average 50m. Probably the project was initiated by Hadrian, who had granted privileges to the cities during a longer stay in the Decapolis. The aqueduct remained operational until the Byzantines lost control of the region after the Battle of Yarmuk in 636.|$|E

40|$|Griffiths, H. M. (2011) 'Clawdd Terfyn' Barddas, 312, p. 23 - 26. This {{collection}} of poems examines {{the impacts of}} climate change on communities in Wales and is structured around images of a farmer on his death bed. Through images of memories, present uncertainties and an apocalyptic future, impacts on landscape and society are presented. The first poem depicts the farmer in hospital kept alive by a life-support machine and medication. The second describes {{a vision of a}} landscape scarred by flooding and erosion, the patterns of human influence on the landscape shattered, which is, possibly, a drug-induced hallucination. Refugees are depicted walking across a post-apocalyptic landscape and a preacher searches for refuge in the chapel. I then return to the old farmer on the ward whose time is running out. The sixth poem depitcs a fuel rationing after peak oil. The seventh poem is full of images from the farmer?s memories of harvesting hay in the days before mechanisation, before his illness and before climate change began to unsettle the familiar patterns. It is a memory distorted by time. The eighth poem depicts a polar bear ?dancing? on the melting and thinning ice, becoming a metaphor for human society. The penultimate poem returns to the farmer who has survived another night, and for whom a new dawn signifies a small measure of hope. The final poem occurs in the recent past, {{at the beginning of the}} farmer?s illness. He is confined to his bed in front of a window, staring out at the land that he used to tend. A storm is brewing, and fields of corn bend <b>as</b> <b>the</b> winds strengthen. <b>Crows</b> <b>fly</b> overhead and <b>the</b> seasons seem to merge. However, he sees his grandson going about his work. The farmer?s resilience in the face of his illness mirrors society?s resilience in the face of climate change. This series of poems received very high commendation in the main poetry competition of the 2011 National Eisteddfod in Wales, and was adjudged to be worthy of the prize. It was published in Barddas, the principal outlet of Welsh medium poetry. The themes discussed arise directly from the poet?s research interests in human-environment interactions and environmental change, and represents an innovative intervention in Welsh literature which has raised the profile of these themes to a wider, non-specialist audience...|$|R
