In this study, the method by which several protozoa degrade 5 '-methylthioadenosine (MTA) was shown to differ from MTA catabolism in human cells. To exploit this metabolic difference, two analogs of methylthioribose (MTR), an MTA catabolite, were synthesized and found to be cytocidal to Plasmodium falciparum, Giardia lamblia, and Ochromonas malhamensis in vitro. In contrast, these analogs had no effect on cultured mammalian cells. Analogs of MTR represent a potential new class of antiprotozoal drugs...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{analyzed}} the antiprotozoal effects of eighteen Cuban propolis extracts (brown, {{red and yellow}} type) collected in different geographic areas, using Leishmania amazonensis (as a model of intracellular protozoa) and Trichomonas vaginalis (as a model of extracellular protozoa). All evaluated propolis extracts caused inhibitory effect on intracellular amastigotes of L. amazonensis. However, cytotoxicity on peritoneal macrophages from BALB/c mice was observed. Only five samples decreased the viability of T. vaginalis trophozoites at concentrations lower than 10 g/mL. No correlation between the type of propolis and antiprotozoal activity was found.

40|$|We {{describe}} herein {{an evaluation}} of the trypanocidal effect of eight piperamides (1 - 8) isolated from Piper tuberculatum bearing dihydropyridone, piperidine, and isobutyl moieties against epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas` disease. Based on such results, three hydrogenated and two hydrolyzed derivatives (10 - 14) were prepared and evaluated as well. The dihydropyridone amides (1 - 3) displayed higher anti-trypanosomal activity. The (Z) -piplartine (1) showed higher activity with a 50 % inhibition concentration (IC(50)) value of 10. 5 mu M, almost four times more potent than the positive control, benznidazole (IC(50) = 42. 7 mu M), and should be further evaluated as a suitable hit for the design of new <b>antiprotozoal</b> <b>agents.</b> FAPESP[03 / 11524 - 9]CNPq[07 / 56140 - 4]CNPq[03 / 00886 - 7...|$|E

40|$|Over 170 {{chemical}} agents were screened for antiprotozoal action in bovine ruminal fluid. Compounds were tested at 0. 1 and 0. 05 % concentrations. Tested compounds included inorganic compounds, antibiotics, biocides, neuromuscular agents, arsenicals, {{plant and animal}} hormones, antimalarials, surface-active agents, anthelmintics, and many others. The most active compounds were cupric sulfate, nickel sulfate, nitrofurazone, hydrogen peroxide, dodecyl sodium sulfate, pelargonic acid, iodoacetic acid, 1 -diethylaminoethylamino- 4 -methylthiaxanthrone, sodium arsanilate, sodium arsenate, bismuth glycolyl arsanilate, 1 -β-hydroxyethyl- 2 -methyl- 5 -nitroimidazole, and p-nitroaniline. Copper ion was not particularly effective against entodinia; nickel ion {{had no effect on}} holotrichs. Hydrogen peroxide and iodoacetic acid were effective at a concentration of 0. 005 %. Anionic surface-active agents were very effective, especially long-chain sulfates and phosphates.

40|$|Several {{species of}} the genus Acanthamoeba cause human diseases. Treatment of infections {{involves}} various problems, emphasising {{the need to develop}} alternative <b>antiprotozoal</b> <b>agents.</b> We studied the anti-amoebic activity of Essential Oils (EOs), derived from rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) and cloves (Syzygium aromaticum L. Merr. & Perry), against Acanthamoeba polyphaga strain. The amoebicidal activity of cloves and rosemary EOs was preliminary demonstrated by the morphology change (modifications in the cell shape, the presence of precipitates in the cytoplasm, autophagic vesicles, membrane blends) of the treated trophozoites. The cell-counts, carried out after staining trophozoites with a Trypan blue solution, revealed that both EOs were active in a dose-dependent manner and in relation to the exposure time. This activity was evident after few hours, with encouraging results obtained in particular with cloves EO, able to act at the lower concentrations and after 1 Â h, probably for its high eugenol content (65. 30 %) ...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is {{a complex}} vaginal {{infection}} most commonly associated with women of child-bearing age. Risk factors for BV are numerous. There are currently multiple clinical and laboratory tests for diagnosis of BV, including {{the most commonly used}} diagnostic methods: Amsel’s criteria or Nugent’s Gram stain scale. The mainstay of BV therapy is metronidazole, but tinidazole as well as a few other agents have also been used successfully. Tinidazole is the second nitroimidazole <b>antiprotozoal</b> <b>agent</b> and a structural derivative of metronidazole. With a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and reduced side effects, tinidazole is an alternative agent for BV treatment. There are minimal head-to-head comparative data to establish tinidazole’s superiority to metronidazole or other therapeutic agents.
