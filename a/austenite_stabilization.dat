40|$|An {{investigation}} of the phase transformation and the <b>austenite</b> <b>stabilization</b> in a high strength austenite has been made. An Fe- 29 Ni- 4. 3 Ti austenite age-hardened by gamma-prime (Ni 3 Ti) precipitates showed a further increase of strength after martensitic and reverse martensitic phase transformations. The stability of ausaged austenite as well as ausaged and transformation-strengthened austenite was improved significantly through an isothermal treatment at 500 C. The Ms temperature of the strengthened austenite was restored to nearly that of annealed austenite while the austenite was hardened to R(C) 41 through precipitation and phase transformations. The observed <b>austenite</b> <b>stabilization</b> is attributed {{to the formation of}} GP zones or short-range order of less than about 10 A in size...|$|E
40|$|The {{quenching}} and partitioning (Q&P) {{process is}} a two-stage heat-treatment procedure proposed for producing steel microstructures that contain carbon-enriched retained austenite. In Q&P processing, <b>austenite</b> <b>stabilization</b> is accomplished by carbon partitioning from supersaturated martensite. A quench temperature selection methodology was developed to predict an optimum process quench temperature; extension of this methodology to include carbon partitioning kinetics is developed here. Final austenite fraction is less sensitive to quench temperature than previously predicted, in agreement with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Quenching and {{partitioning}} (Q&P) {{has been}} developed as a novel steel heat treatment to produce advanced high-strength microstructures consisting of a martensitic matrix containing significant amounts of retained austenite. <b>Austenite</b> <b>stabilization</b> is hypothesized to result from decarburization of the martensite and transport into the austenite. Differential scanning calorimetry was employed to study Q&P microstructures. Two exothermic events were observed when heating a Q& P sample from room temperature to 600 C. An activation energy suggesting a mechanism controlled by carbon diffusion in bcc iron is obtained for the first peak which {{is believed to be}} associated with carbon partitioning. The second peak is believed to be associated with austenite decomposition...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe medium Mn steels are a {{topic of}} {{interest}} from both practical and scientific point of view. Many studies were focused on the microstructure characterization, but only some of them addressed the mechanisms of <b>austenite</b> formation and <b>stabilization.</b> Hence, there are still remaining questions regarding {{the link between the}} optimum retained austenite fraction and stability and the austenite formation including both the morphological and kinetics aspects. In this work, different ART annealing treatments were performed on a cold rolled 0. 1 C – 4. 7 Mn (wt. %) steel. SEM and TEM observations as well as XRD and magnetic measurements were done to characterize the resulting microstructures. Microstructure evolution was analyzed as a function of soaking time: precipitation and dissolution of cementite; austenite nucleation, growth and stabilization. The experimental observations were compared with the predictions from thermodynamic calculations. Based on the obtained results, a mechanism of <b>austenite</b> formation and <b>stabilization</b> during ART annealing is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This work {{presents}} the results of investigations using Mössbauer spectroscopy technique and XRD, and their interpretation concerning precipitations and transformation of iron carbides and retained <b>austenite</b> <b>stabilization.</b> It also discusses changes in hardened matrix during tempering in relation to previously conducted dilatometric, microscopic and mechanical examinations. This research was carried out using a new high-carbon alloy 120 MnCrMoV 8 - 6 - 4 - 2 steel, which was designed in 1998, in Phase Transformations Research Group at the AGH UST. The influence of the tempering time on the mechanical and chemical stability of retained austenite and on the products of its transformation, nucleation and solubility of iron carbides and cementite nucleation and growth, was determined...|$|E
40|$|A {{development}} program {{was performed to}} establish whether a corrosion-resistant bearing material, such as a 14 Cr steel, could be modified to allow carburization, thereby providing the excellent fracture toughness characteristics feasible with this process. The alloy selected for investigation was AMS 5749. Several modifications were made including {{the addition of a}} small amount of nickel for <b>austenite</b> <b>stabilization.</b> While some promising results were achieved, the primary objective of an acceptable combination of case hardness and microstructure was not attained. Because the high chromium content presents a serious problem in achieving a viable carburizing cycle, a number of experimental steels having lower chromium contents (8 to 12 %) were produced in laboratory quantities and evaluated. The results were basically the same as those initially obtained with the modified AMS 5749. Corrosion tests were performed on AMS 5749, AISI M 50, and 52100 bearing steels {{as well as some of}} the lower chromium steels. These tests showed that a reduced chromium level (10 to 12 %) provided essentially the same corrosion protection as the 14 Cr steels...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the development of}} high performance steels presenting higher properties of strength and ductility rely on the TRIP effect, i. e. on the mech. -induced martensitic transformation of retained austenite dispersed in a soft ferrite-based matrix. As a consequence, the stabilization and retention of austenite at room temp. have become of primary importance, leading to specifically designed steel grades and thermal or thermomech. treatments. Particularly, carbon enrichment of the austenite during intercrit. annealing and bainite transformation was effective in retaining austenite. This study deals with the influence of chem. geometrical and mech. parameters of the microstructure of low alloy steels on the retention of austenite at room temp. The influence of different alloying elements on the inhibition of cementite pptn. and on the resulting <b>austenite</b> <b>stabilization</b> during the bainite transformation is scrutinised. The influence of the redn. in the austenite grain size on the mechanisms of nucleation and growth of bainite is demonstrated. Finally, the change in bainite morphol. resulting from prior deformation of the austenite is clearly exemplified and explainedinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Hot-rolling direct {{quenching}} and partitioning (HDQ&P) processes {{were applied to}} both low carbon high silicon vanadium micro-alloyed steel and low carbon low silicon steel with phosphorus addition. Proeutectoid ferrite with an area fraction of about 30 % was introduced {{into some of the}} sheets. Microstructures were characterized using SEM, TEM and XRD. Mechanical properties were investigated by means of uniaxial tensile test. <b>Austenite</b> <b>stabilization,</b> retained austenite stability, tensile deformation and fracture were comprehensively analyzed by making the comparison between the two steels and between the sheets with and without ferrite considering the different precipitation statuses in ferrite. Experimental results showed that the high silicon vanadium micro-alloyed steel contained more retained austenite with higher stability compared with the low silicon phosphorus added steel. Filled with much more carbides with larger sizes, the martensite in the low silicon phosphorus added steel exhibited a much salient tempered feature. The high silicon vanadium added steel possessed higher strength and ductility than the low silicon phosphorus added steel. The introduction of ferrite can result in an extremely obvious post-necking elongation drop in the low silicon phosphorus added steel. The dispersed V-bearing precipitates and high silicon content in ferrite can increase the yield strength and simultaneously diminish the hardness difference betwee...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{a lot of}} effort has been paid to {{optimising}} the thermomechanical processing of TRIP steels that stands for transformation induced plasticity. The precise characterization of the resulting multiphase microstructure of low alloyed TRIP steels is of great importance for the interpretation and optimisation of their mechanical properties. The results obtained in situ neutron diffraction laboratory experiment concerning the austenite to ferrite transformation in Si-Mn bulk TRIP steel specimens, displaying the transformation induced plasticity (TRIP), are presented. The advancement of ferrite formation during transformation in conditioned austenite is investigated at different transformation temperatures and has been monitored using neutron diffraction method. The relevant information on transformation proceeding is extracted from neutron diffraction spectra. The integrated intensities of austenite and ferrite neutron diffraction profiles developed during the transformation are then assumed as a measure of the phase volume fractions of both phases in dependence on transformation temperature and austenite conditioning. According to the yielding information on ferrite volume fractions from isothermal transformation kinetics data the thermo mechanical processing of bulk specimen was designed in order to support <b>austenite</b> <b>stabilization</b> through bainitic transformation. The volume fractions of retained austenite resulting at alternating transformation conditions were measured by neutron and X-ray diffraction respectively. The stability of retained austenite in bulk specimens during room temperature mechanical testing was characterized by in situ neutron diffraction experiments as well...|$|E
40|$|Multiphase TRIP steels are a {{relatively}} new class of steels exhibiting excellent combinations of strength and cold formability, a fact that renders them particularly attractive for automotive applications. The present work reports models regarding the prediction of the stability of retained austenite, the optimisation of the heat-treatment stages necessary for <b>austenite</b> <b>stabilization</b> in the microstructure, {{as well as the}} mechanical behaviour of these steels under deformation. Austenite stability against mechanically-induced transformation to martensite depends on chemical composition, austenite particle size, strength of the matrix and stress state. The stability of retained austenite is characterized by the M-S(sigma) temperature, which can be expressed {{as a function of the}} aforementioned parameters by an appropriate model presented in this work. Besides stability, the mechanical behaviour of TRIP steels also depends on the amount of retained austenite present in the microstructure. This amount is determined by the combinations of temperature and temporal duration of the heat-treatment stages undergone by the steel. Maximum amounts of retained austenite require optimisation of the heat-treatment conditions. A physical model is presented in this work, which is based on the interactions between bainite and austenite during the heat-treatment of multiphase TRIP steels, and which allows for the selection of treatment conditions leading to the maximization of retained austenite in the final microstructure. Finally, a constitutive micromechanical model is presented, which describes the mechanical behaviour of multiphase TRIP steels under deformation, taking into account the different plastic behaviour of the individual phases, as well as the evolution of the microstructure itself during plastic deformation. This constitutive micromechanical model is subsequently used for the calculation of forming limit diagrams (FLD) for these complex steels, an issue of great practical importance for the optimisation of stretch-forming and deep-drawing operations...|$|E
40|$|Low-alloy TRIP steels are a {{new class}} of steels with {{excellent}} combinations of strength and formability, which offer a unique field for the study of multiscale effects in materials, in the sense that experimental observations and models referring to different scale levels have to be combined, for the understanding and the design of these steels. In the present work, models involving multiscale physical quantities are reported, which regard prediction of the stability of retained austenite and of the kinetics of its mechanically-induced transformation to martensite, optimization of the heat-treatment stages necessary for <b>austenite</b> <b>stabilization</b> in the microstructure, as well as prediction of the mechanical behaviour of these steels under deformation. Austenite stability depends on chemical composition, austenite particle size, strength of the matrix and stress state, i. e. on factors ranging from the nano- to the macro-scale. The stability of retained austenite against mechanically-induced transformation to martensite is characterized by the s M temperature, which can be derived {{as a function of the}} aforementioned multiscale factors by an appropriate model presented in this work. The kinetics of the mechanically-induced transformation of retained austenite to martensite are also dependent on multiscale factors, such as the population density of martensitic nucleation sites, the retained austenite particle size and the macroscopic level of plastic deformation. In the present work, a model describing the kinetics of this mechanically-induced transformation as a function of these factors is presented. Furthermore, the mechanical behaviour of TRIP steels also depends on the amount of retained austenite present in the microstructure, which is determined by the combinations of temperature and temporal duration of the heat-treatment stages undergone by the steel. Optimum amounts of retained austenite require optimization of the heat-treatment conditions. A physical model is presented in this work, which is based on the interactions between bainite and austenite during the heat-treatment of TRIP steels, which allows for the selection of treatment conditions leading to the maximization of retained austenite in the final microstructure. Finally, a constitutive micromechanical model is presented, which describes the mechanical behaviour of TRIP steels under deformation, taking into account the evolution of the microstructure during plastic deformation. This model is then used for the calculation of forming limit diagrams (FLD) for these complex steels, thus allowing for the optimization of stretch-forming and deep-drawing operations. © 2007 Springer...|$|E
