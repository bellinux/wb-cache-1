5|$|Dannatt was {{appointed}} Chief of the General Staff (CGS) in August 2006, succeeding General Sir Mike Jackson. Dannatt faced controversy over his outspokenness, in particular his calls for improved pay and conditions for soldiers {{and for a}} drawdown of operations in Iraq {{in order to better}} man those in Afghanistan. He also set about trying to increase his public profile, worried that he was not recognisable enough <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had to defend the Army's reputation against alleged prisoner abuse in Iraq. He later assisted with the formation of Help for Heroes to fund a swimming pool at Headley Court and, later in his tenure, brokered an agreement with the British press that allowed Prince Harry to serve in Afghanistan. He was succeeded as CGS by Sir David Richards and retired in 2009, taking up the largely honorary post of Constable of the Tower of London, which he held until July 2016.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's second (or third) wife, Maria of Mangup, was of {{the family}} of the princes of Theodoro. She was {{probably}} also cousins with the Muscovite Grand Princess Sophia Palaiologina, and was related to Trebizond's royal couple, Emperor David and Empress Maria. The Stephen–Maria marriage took place in September 1472, but she died in December 1477. During her brief stay in Moldavia, Maria supported the Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople, contributing to the friendly contacts between Stephen and Catholic powers. Stephen's third (or fourth) wife, Maria Voichița, was the daughter of Radu the Fair, Voivode of Wallachia. She was the mother of Stephen's immediate successor, Bogdan, and a daughter named Maria Cneajna. The latter married into the House of Sanguszko. Stephen is known to have fathered two other sons who died in childhood, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was married to Maria Voichița: Bogdan died in 1479, and Peter (Petrașco) in 1480. Scholars are divided as to whether their mother was Evdochia or Maria. Archivist Aurelian Sacerdoțeanu believes that Bogdan also had a twin, Iliaș.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg's {{resources}} were worn out after {{over a decade}} of continuous war. Alfonso and the pope could not provide for him fully, while Venice continued to undermine Skanderbeg. The latter considered war with Skanderbeg since he maintained his alliance with Aragon. Relations with the Italian state worsened further when Lekë Dukagjini, Skanderbeg's elusive ally in the north, captured Dagnum. Even though Skanderbeg {{did not participate in}} this, Venice used it as a casus belli to launch an expedition against Skanderbeg. War never started but Albanian-Venetian relations sunk to their lowest point. The Venetian rectors continued to provoke Skanderbeg <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had grown relatively weak due to his nephew and one of his most important officers, Hamza Kastrioti, deserting and joining the Ottomans. Hamza had become dissatisfied with Skanderbeg's growing power and, upon being received by the sultan, was offered control over much of Albania once conquered. Stung by the betrayal, Skanderbeg offered an ultimatum to Venice where they had to halt their provocations or begin war. Since a crusade was anticipated against the Ottomans, Venice did not want to seem pro-Ottoman and eased their stance towards Albania.|$|E

5|$|The same year, Grant {{acquired}} a slave from his father-in-law, a thirty-five-year-old man named William Jones. In March 1859, Grant freed William, worth about $1,500, instead of selling him <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> desperately needed money. Grant moved to St. Louis, {{taking on a}} partnership with Julia's cousin Harry Boggs working in real estate business as a bill collector, again without success, and at Julia's recommendation dissolved his partnership. In August, Grant applied for a position as county engineer, believing his education qualified him for the job. His application came with thirty-five notable recommendations, but Grant correctly assumed the position would be given {{on the basis of}} political affiliation and was passed over as he was believed to share his father-in-law's Democratic sentiments. In April 1860, Grant and his family moved north to Galena, accepting a position in his father's leather goods business run by his younger brothers Simpson and Orvil. In a few months, Ulysses paid off the debts he acquired in Missouri. Ulysses and family attended the local Methodist church and he soon established himself as a reputable citizen of Galena.|$|E

25|$|Besides Historia, he {{published}} Miraculum naturae sive uteri muliebris fabrica in 1672 and Ephemeri vita, in 1674.

The work contains long passages on the glory of the creator. His Bybel der Natuure was a collection of his papers and drawings.|$|E
25|$|Many saw Birt's role in {{government}} as controversial, since {{as a special}} advisor, rather than a civil servant, he was not formally obliged to face questions from House of Commons Select committees.

25|$|Members of the Labour Party accused John Key {{of lying}} about his {{shareholding}} in Tranz Rail, by not disclosing {{nearly half of}} the shares he and his family trusts owned in the company, even though this presented a clear conflict of interest with Key's role as his party's spokesperson on transport, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> asked several questions in the House about the government's plans regarding rail infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{returning}} to Australia after the war, Iverson only played golf and tennis for recreation, {{until he had}} a chance encounter with blind cricketers near the Melbourne Cricket Ground which motivated him to join the suburban Brighton Cricket Club <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had no cricketing equipment. He rose rapidly, from the third XI at Brighton in late 1946, to the Melbourne Cricket Club in 1948 and the Victorian team a year later.|$|E
25|$|At age eight, Nadal won an under-12 {{regional}} tennis championship <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{was also}} a promising football player. This made Toni Nadal intensify training, {{and at that time}} he encouraged Nadal to play left-handed for a natural advantage on the tennis court, as he noticed Nadal played forehand shots with two hands. This {{may be due to the}} fact he is ambidextrous, playing tennis with his left hand, and writing with his right.|$|E

25|$|Beethoven's {{love life}} was {{hampered}} by class issues. In late 1801 {{he met a}} young countess, Julie ("Giulietta") Guicciardi through the Brunsvik family, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was giving regular piano lessons to Josephine Brunsvik. Beethoven mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to his boyhood friend, Franz Wegeler, {{but he could not}} consider marrying her, due to the class difference. Beethoven later dedicated to her his Sonata No. 14, now commonly known as the Moonlight sonata or Mondscheinsonate (in German).|$|E

In 2005, Warne also broke the record for the number of wickets in a calendar year, with 96 wickets. His ferocious competitiveness was a feature of the 2005 Ashes series, when he took 40 wickets at an average of 19.92 and scored 249 runs. Warne shared player of the series honour with England's Andrew Flintoff.|$|E
25|$|Malan {{grew up in}} {{a middle-class}} and pro-apartheid Afrikaner family in a white suburb of Johannesburg. He {{attended}} Blairgowrie Primary School in Randburg.

He attended the then Witwatersrand University for a year. To avoid conscription, which was compulsory for all white males (see End Conscription Campaign), he moved to Los Angeles in 1977 and worked as a journalist.|$|E

25|$|In film, he {{has been}} {{consistently}} depicted as a villain, and with scant regard for accuracy. In Cecil B. de Mille's 1935 film The Crusades, he is played by Joseph Schildkraut as a scheming traitor, plotting King Richard's death with Prince John in England <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was actually already defending Tyre. The 1954 film King Richard and the Crusaders, loosely based on The Talisman, similarly depicts him as a villain, played by Michael Pate. Egyptian director Youssef Chahine's 1963 film Al Nasser Salah Ad-Din also shows Scott's influence in its hostility towards Conrad (played by Mahmoud El-Meliguy) and Philip, while depicting Richard more favourably.|$|E
25|$|Suez damaged Eden's {{reputation}} for statesmanship, in many eyes, {{and led to}} a breakdown in his health. He went on vacation to Jamaica in November 1956, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was still determined to soldier on as Prime Minister. His health, however, did not improve, and during his absence from London his Chancellor Harold Macmillan and Rab Butler worked to manoeuvre him out of office. On the morning of the ceasefire Eisenhower agreed to meet with Eden to publicly resolve their differences, but this offer was later withdrawn after Secretary of State Dulles advised that it could inflame the Middle Eastern situation further.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, Williams {{was elected}} {{a fellow of}} his alma mater, Trinity College, Cambridge. He left Westcott and joined Trinity as a {{lecturer}} in the New Testament.

He underwent psychoanalysis, which would alter profoundly his understanding of himself and his faith. Appointed Dean of Trinity College Chapel in 1958, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> still found officiating difficult, he gradually regained his confidence and continued in post for eleven years.|$|E
