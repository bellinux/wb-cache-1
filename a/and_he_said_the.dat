500|$|Calum Waddell, in Fighting Spirit Magazine, called The Ultimate Warrior's {{win over}} the Honky Tonk Man [...] "genuinely captivating," [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> match between The British Bulldogs and The Fabulous Rougeaus was an [...] "exciting battle". In contrast, he had a {{negative}} reaction to the main event match, citing it as [...] "predictably one-dimensional" [...] and [...] "abysmal". Similarly, Adam Nedeff of 411mania.com called the tag team match between The British Bulldogs and The Rougeaus [...] "a solid match" [...] but stated that the [...] "lack of a finish was a disappointment". Although he reviewed most of the matches negatively, he called the WWF World Tag Team Championship match a [...] "good match". Overall, he rated the event a 4.5 out of 10 and stated, [...] "Without Warrior's big win and Elizabeth's surprise finish, this is a totally forgettable show." ...|$|E
500|$|The part of John Munch {{was based}} on Jay Landsman, a {{practical}} joker who was known in his homicide unit for his morbid wit. Both Belzer and the character Munch he portrays are cynical, caustic former hippies who are so similar that Belzer declared the character [...] "exactly as I would be if I were a cop". Stanley Bolander was inspired by Detective Donald Worden who, like his on-screen counterpart, was nicknamed [...] "The Big Man". Ned Beatty only met Worden once before taking on the role, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> detective had [...] "an uncluttered mind and a near-photographic memory". Beau Felton {{was based on}} Detective Donald Kincaid, and Felton's clashes with Pembleton were based on Kincaid's real-life strong dislike for Harry Edgerton. Kay Howard was {{based in part on}} the female Detective Bert Silver, and in part on the male Detective Rich Garvey, who experienced a real-life string of good luck in solving consecutive cases, just as Howard did in the first season.|$|E

One Vietnamese public servant said that [...] "All these preparations are the result of a big misunderstanding on both sides.

500|$|Ford became Vice President as the Watergate scandal was unfolding. On Thursday, August 1, 1974, Chief of Staff Alexander Haig {{contacted}} Ford to {{tell him}} that [...] "smoking gun" [...] evidence had been found. The evidence left little doubt that President Nixon had {{been a part of the}} Watergate cover-up. At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated vice president's residence in Washington, D.C. However, [...] "Al Haig asked to come over and see me," [...] Ford later said, [...] "to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared, that things might change dramatically and you could become President.' And I said, 'Betty, I don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house.|$|E
500|$|On August 4, 2007, at 2:45a.m., she {{discovered}} {{the money that}} became part of a political scandal in the electoral campaign of President of Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. It was {{in the possession of}} a Key Biscayne, Florida, associate of President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez. The carrier, Guido Antonini Wilson (who is referred to in the press by both Antonini and Wilson and who is sometimes referred to by the nicknames [...] "El Gordo" [...] or [...] "The Fat Man"), is an interpreter and was part of a delegation of executives that traveled to Argentina in advance of Chávez' energy deal signing. He opened the bag at the insistence of Telpuk, who noticed the six dense and perfectly rectangular blocks in the luggage scans. At first, Wilson had explained the items as books and papers. When forced to open it, he began to stammer and show signs of nervousness, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> suitcase only contained about $60,000. The blocks turned out to be US$790,550. The delegation, which arrived on a Cessna Citation jet from Caracas, Venezuela, chartered by Energía Argentina, SA, carried five Venezuelans and three Argentines who represented their respective governments' energy companies. In a country known for its corruption, Telpuk did not have an interest in a bribe although she felt Wilson may have expected her to be willing to take one. Instead of pursuing a bribe, she reported the finding.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, Kaplický won {{the design}} {{competition}} for the new Czech National Library building. This {{was to have been}} his first major building in his home country, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> project was the most important event in his life. However, the design for the building, resembling a green and purple blob and nicknamed by locals [...] "the Octopus", was heavily criticised. President of the Czech Republic Václav Klaus was overheard saying {{he would be willing to}} prevent the building going ahead with his own body; his spokesman later clarified it was an off-hand remark that had not been meant to be taken seriously. Pavel Bém, the Civic Democrat Mayor of Prague, supported the design when it was selected but later become hostile to it, saying that the City Council of Prague, which is dominated by the Civil Democratic Party, would not allow the Octopus to be built as it would ruin Prague's panorama. Vlastimil Jezek, a former director of the Library, regarded Kaplický as [...] "another protagonist of Czech culture who has been crushed by Czech narrow-mindedness." [...] Although the design was eventually dropped, Kaplický remained hopeful that the building would be built through funds from a private foundation established for this purpose.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his first}} four days at home his {{appetite}} decreased and his cough worsened; this prompted {{his parents to}} send him to the doctor, who, at once, ordered bed rest. Inflammation was diagnosed, and as was the custom at that time, the doctor decided to perform bloodletting. The doctor cut Dominic's arm ten times in the space of four days and it is now considered that this probably hastened his death. In his biography, John Bosco records that Dominic was calm throughout the procedure. The doctor assured his parents that the danger had passed and now it only remained for him to recuperate. Dominic, however, was sure that his death was approaching, and asked that he be allowed to make his Confession and receive Communion. Though they thought it unnecessary, his parents sent for the parish priest who heard Dominic's confession and administered the Eucharist. After four days, despite the conviction of the doctor and his parents that he would get better, Dominic asked that he be given the Anointing of the Sick in preparation for death. Again, his parents agreed, to please him. On March 9, he was given the papal blessing <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> Confiteor. Don Bosco records that throughout these days, he stayed serene and calm. On the evening of March 9, 1857, after being visited by his parish priest, he asked his father to read him the prayers for the Exercise of a Happy Death from his book of devotions. Then he slept a while, and shortly awakened and said in a clear voice, ...|$|E

The Economist attributed the exodus from Haifa to orders to leave from the Higher Arab Executive as well as expulsion by Jewish troops.
