40|$|Abstract — In {{smart card}} {{embedded}} programs, some operations {{must not be}} suddenly interrupted, because if they are, the card is left in an inconsistent state. Since the card can be removed at any time from the terminal, which interrupts any running program, some instructions must be executed at each reset in order to verify if a tearing occurred and to restore a consistent state if necessary. In this case, the card is said to ensure the <b>anti-tearing</b> property. This paper presents a method to formally prove that a C program verifies the <b>anti-tearing</b> property for a given “tearingsensitive” operation. The back-ground methodology, presented in [1], [2], enables to prove global properties from source code. It is here illustrated by the proof of <b>anti-tearing</b> properties, which requires {{an extension of the}} method in order to specify and verify functions behaviour {{in the case of a}} sudden interruption of their execution...|$|E
40|$|As the {{progress}} of modern techniques for cataract extraction surgery and various needs of intraocular lens(IOL) implantation, continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis(CCC) is still in absolute dominance among different ways of incision of anterior capsular lens in clinical practices, due to its advantages such as smoothness of capsulor opening, strong <b>anti-tearing</b> ability, integrity of supporting capsular bag, and strength at maintaining IOL stability. This article describes in general {{the historical development of}} CCC and complementary methods adapted to raise success rate when it is used in special cases of cataract extraction surgery. Meanwhile, the article also discusses briefly and envisions the prospects of femotsecond laser applied in CCC technique for cataract extraction...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{presented}} to prepare anatomical slides of plant materials including a combination of soft and hard tissues, such as stems with cambial variants, arboreal monocotyledons, and tree bark The method integrates previous techniques aimed at softening the samples and making them thereby more homogeneous, {{with the use of}} <b>anti-tearing</b> polystyrene foam solution In addition, we suggest two other alternatives to protect the sections from tearing adhesive tape and/or Mayer`s albumin adhesive, both combined with the polystyrene foam solution This solution is cheap and easy to make by dissolving any packaging polystyrene m butyl acetate It is applied before each section is cut on a sliding microtome and ensures that all the tissues in the section will hold together This novel microtechnical procedure will facilitate the study of heterogeneous plant portions, as shown in some illustrated example...|$|E
