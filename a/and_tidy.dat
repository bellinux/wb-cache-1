25|$|From Dachau, the Rebbe was {{dispatched}} to the Muldorf Forest, where the Nazis were building an underground airport, hangar and missile batteries in order to bomb major European cities. He {{and thousands of other}} prisoners were forced to work 12-hour shifts, carrying 110-pound bags of cement from the rail depot to the cement mixers inside the hangar. Halberstam grew very weak from this difficult work. When he collapsed under his burden, he was beaten. He refused to work at all on Shabbat, which brought on more beatings. Finally, his friends persuaded the camp managers to give him to the job of camp custodian, allowing him to sweep <b>and</b> <b>tidy</b> the barracks while engaging in prayer the entire day.|$|E
25|$|The reader learns a {{great deal}} about what the family was like from how the robots {{continue}} on in their functions. Breakfast is automatically made, clothes are laid out, voice reminders of daily activities are called out, but no one is there. Robotic mice vacuum the home <b>and</b> <b>tidy</b> up. As the day progresses, the rain quits, and the house prepares lunch and opens like a flower to the warm weather. A starving dog, apparently the family pet, whines at the door, is admitted and dies. Outside, a vivid image is given: the family's silhouettes were permanently burned onto {{the side of the house}} (as occurred at Hiroshima) when they were vaporized by the nuclear explosion. That night, a storm crashes a tree into the home, starting a fire that the house cannot combat, as the municipal water supply has dried up and failed. By the next morning, the entire house has collapsed except for one wall that announces the date over and over.|$|E
25|$|William Lever {{was born}} on 19 September 1851 at 16 Wood Street, Bolton, Lancashire, England. He was the eldest son and the seventh child born to James Lever (1809–1897), a grocer, and Eliza Hesketh, {{daughter}} of a cotton mill manager. From age six to age nine William attended a small private school run by the Misses Aspinwall in a house on Wood Street, {{not far from the}} Lever family home. At the age of nine he was sent to another of Bolton's private schools before finishing his formal education at Bolton Church Institute from 1864 to 1867. Not a particularly bright scholar, he was nevertheless keen to acquire academic learning. His mother wanted him to enter the learned professions, ostensibly medicine, and William himself was very interested in becoming an architect. His father, however, had other, somewhat less erudite plans for his eldest son and thus, not long after his fifteenth birthday, he started work in the family grocery business. By then, the Lever family had moved from Wood Street to a larger house adjacent to the grocery business. In the celebrated Victorian manner, the boss’s son was, initially at least, shown no preferential treatment, being required to sweep the floor <b>and</b> <b>tidy</b> up before the staff arrived. Other tasks included various practical assignments {{more to do with the}} fundamentals of the wholesale grocery trade, almost certainly designed to prepare the youth for management in later years. His remuneration was “a shilling a week all found” which meant that his board and lodgings were provided, making the financial aspect of the contract more-or-less pocket money.|$|E

500|$|Melinda Houston, {{writing for}} The Age, called Sense and Sensibility [...] "a {{gorgeous}} adaptation {{of her most}} frivolous work" [...] and added, [...] "It's all beautifully made, beautifully cast, and the script snaps and crackles. Maybe Eleanor isn't quite as flawed as originally drawn but that's unlikely to detract from your enjoyment." [...] Lenny Ann Low from The Sydney Morning Herald stated, [...] "The locations, costumes and acting are excellent, with a particularly striking use of light – cold and grey skies foretelling doom through to rich candlelight signalling new passions." [...] The New York Times critic Ginia Bellafante said, [...] "There's nothing glaringly wrong with this new Sense and Sensibility, the last in Masterpiece's winter-long homage to Austen; it is both lush <b>and</b> <b>tidy.</b> But it alters the emotional chemistry, {{and the result is}} an adaptation that feels more arid than Mr. Lee's effort." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1976, {{speaking}} as The Thin White Duke, Bowie's persona at the time, and [...] "at least partially tongue-in-cheek", he made statements that {{expressed support for}} fascism and perceived admiration for Adolf Hitler in interviews with Playboy, NME and a Swedish publication. Bowie was quoted as saying: [...] "Britain is ready for a fascist leader... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism... I believe very strongly in fascism, people have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership." [...] He was also quoted as saying: [...] "Adolf Hitler {{was one of the}} first rock stars" [...] and [...] "You've got to have an extreme right front come up and sweep everything off its feet <b>and</b> <b>tidy</b> everything up." [...] Bowie later retracted these comments in an interview with Melody Maker in October 1977, blaming them on mental instability caused by his drug problems at the time, saying: [...] "I was out of my mind, totally, completely crazed." ...|$|E

500|$|Certainly he {{must have}} been a very talented writer, gaining a {{reputation}} of eloquence while he still lived in London (Bethurum, 58). [...] In a letter to him, [...] "the writer asks to be excused from translating something Wulfstan had asked him to render into English and pleads as an excuse his lack of ability in comparison with the bishop’s skill" [...] (58). [...] Similarly, [...] "ne early student of Wulfstan, Einenkel, and his latest editor, Jost, agree in thinking he wrote verse and not prose" [...] (Continuations, 229). [...] This suggests Wulfstan's writing is not only eloquent, but poetic, and among many of his rhetorical devices is marked rhythm (229). [...] Taking a look at Wulfstan's actual manuscripts, presented by Volume 17 of Early English Manuscripts in Facsimile, it becomes apparent that his writing was exceptionally neat and well structured– even his notes in the margins are well organised <b>and</b> <b>tidy,</b> and his handwriting itself is ornate but readable.|$|E
500|$|Diane Hamer likens Bannon's {{work to the}} Mills and Boon of lesbian literature, {{but unlike}} {{conventional}} romance novels, her stories never really have neat <b>and</b> <b>tidy</b> conclusions. Hamer also takes note of Bannon's use of Freudian symbolism: in I Am a Woman, Jack frequently mentions that he is being psychoanalyzed, and his friends react with interest. Jack labels Laura [...] "Mother" [...] and continues to refer to this nickname instead of her real name throughout the series, as though Bannon—through Jack—is vaguely mocking Freud and the ideas that have framed the construction of sexuality in the 1950s. Scholar Michele Barale remarks that Bannon's literary devices in Beebo Brinker defy {{the expectations of the}} audience for whom the novel was specifically marketed: heterosexual males. Bannon chooses the first character, an [...] "everyman" [...] named—significantly—Jack Mann, with whom the male audience identifies, only to divulge that he is gay and has maternal instincts. His interest turns to Beebo, whom he finds [...] "handsome" [...] and lost, and he takes her home, gets her drunk, and becomes asexually intimate with her. Barale writes that Bannon manipulates male readers to become interested in the story, then turns them into voyeurs and imposes homosexual desires upon them, though eventually places them in a safe position to understand a gay story from a heterosexual point of view.|$|E
2500|$|The Tanka prostitutes were {{considered}} to be [...] "low class", greedy for money, arrogant, and treating clients with a bad attitude, they were known for punching their clients or mocking them by calling them names.

2500|$|Another {{limitation}} of OFT {{is that it}} lacks precision in practice.

[...] However, in reality, {{it is difficult to}} define basic concepts like prey type, encounter rates, or even a patch as the forager perceives them.
