5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E

25|$|I {{bought my}} first copy in 1968 – a small, fat bundle of Pelican {{with a picture}} of a Yorkshire miner on the front – and I still have it, bandaged up and {{exhausted}} by the years of labour. From the first of its 900-odd pages, I knew, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> at the University of Sussex knew, that this was something else. We talked about it in the bar and on the bus and in the refectory queue. Imagine that: young male students more interested in a book than in gooseberry tart and custard.|$|E

25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> {{were all very}} worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E
500|$|Groups who cited Slayer {{among their}} major {{influences}} include Bullet for My Valentine, Slipknot, Gojira, Hatebreed Cannibal Corpse, Pantera, Kreator, Mayhem, Darkthrone, System of a Down, Lamb of God, Behemoth, Evile and Lacuna Coil. Steve Asheim, drummer for Deicide, declared that [...] "there obviously {{would not have}} been a Deicide as we know it without the existence of Slayer." [...] Sepultura guitarist Andreas Kisser affirmed that [...] "without Slayer, Sepultura would never be possible." [...] Weezer mentions them in the song [...] "Heart Songs" [...] from their 2008 self-titled [...] "Red" [...] album. The verse goes: [...] "Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and Slayer taught me how to shred..." [...] Dave Grohl recalled, [...] "Me <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends,</b> we just wanted to listen to fucking Slayer and take acid and smash stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the song came from a street named Blue Jay Way, one of the [...] "bird streets" [...] high in the Hollywood Hills West area {{overlooking}} the Sunset Strip, where Harrison had rented a house for his stay. Jet-lagged after the flight from London, he began writing the composition on a Hammond organ as he and Boyd waited for Taylor and the latter's wife, Joan, to join them. The home's location, on a hillside of narrow, winding roads, together with the foggy conditions that night, created the backdrop for the song's opening lines: [...] "There's a fog upon L.A. / <b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> have lost their way." [...] Harrison had almost completed the song {{by the time the}} Taylors arrived, around two hours later than planned.|$|E

500|$|Minaj {{has said}} that artists who have {{influenced}} her musical style include Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes, Lil Wayne, Smokey Robinson, Lauryn Hill, Jadakiss, Natasha Bedingfield, Remy Ma, Lil' Kim, Missy Elliott, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Beyoncé, Britney Spears, Marilyn Monroe, Grace Jones, M.I.A., Cyndi Lauper and TLC. She cites Foxy Brown and Jay-Z as major influences: [...] "I really loved [...] as a female rapper. I was really interested in her mind and her aura [...] I was really, really into Jay-Z. Me <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> in high school, we were reciting all of the Jay lyrics. His words were our words in our conversations all the time." [...] She said: [...] "I never really told Foxy how much she has influenced me and how much she changed my life, and you've gotta tell people that when they're alive to {{even be able to}} take the compliment, instead of paying tribute to them when they're no longer here", adding that Foxy Brown was [...] "the most influential female rapper" [...] for her, though she initially was compared to Lil Kim when she first debuted. Nicki and Lil Kim, often cited as Foxy's main rap rival, have reportedly exchanged words with each other, on social media and in their music.|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able to}} get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E
500|$|Jinnah devoted much of {{his time}} to his law {{practice}} in the early 1900s, but remained politically involved. [...] Jinnah began political life by attending the Congress's twentieth annual meeting, in Bombay in December 1904. He {{was a member of the}} moderate group in the Congress, favouring Hindu–Muslim unity in achieving self-government, and following such leaders as Mehta, Naoroji, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale. They were opposed by leaders such as Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai, who sought quick action towards independence. [...] In 1906, a delegation of Muslim leaders headed by the Aga Khan called on the new Viceroy of India, Lord Minto, to assure him of their loyalty and to ask for assurances that in any political reforms they would be protected from the [...] "unsympathetic [...] majority". [...] Dissatisfied with this, Jinnah wrote a letter to the editor of the newspaper Gujarati, asking what right the members of the delegation had to speak for Indian Muslims, as they were unelected and self-appointed. [...] When many of the same leaders met in Dacca in December of that year to form the All-India Muslim League to advocate for their community's interests, Jinnah was again opposed. The Aga Khan later wrote that it was [...] "freakishly ironic" [...] that Jinnah, who would lead the League to independence, [...] "came out in bitter hostility toward all that I <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> had done... He said that our principle of separate electorates was dividing the nation against itself." [...] In its earliest years, however, the League was not influential; Minto refused to consider it as the Muslim community's representative, and it was ineffective in preventing the 1911 repeal of the partition of Bengal, an action seen as a blow to Muslim interests.|$|E

Clapton issued a statement the next day, saying that the victims [...] "were my companions, my associates <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends.</b> This is a tragic loss of some very special people. I will miss all of them very much." [...] A Coptic cross necklace, worn by Vaughan, was given to Jimmie Vaughan.|$|E
2500|$|On August 6, 2010, Prince Albert II, the Principality of Monaco's Head of State, and his fiancée Charlene Wittstock, on a {{vacation}} tour of the United States, also toured Graceland. Albert explained: [...] "If you're on a summer holiday, you've got to come {{at this time of}} year. I've always wanted to come to Graceland. Charlene <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> wanted to be here today for this visit, Elvis touched our lives as well and the lives of so many people.

2500|$|In {{interview}} with People, she revealed she draws her musical inspirations from humming a melody off the note of a whirring fan or tapping her {{foot to the}} rhythm of the bathtub dripping; stating she can hear melodies from natural sounds like birds chirping or the taxis and construction in Manhattan. Occasionally, however, Harrison wishes she could stop the music. [...] "In the middle of a conversation, I'll start humming or moving my feet, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> will say, 'You can't be serious, she says. [...] "It's such a reflex that I'm totally unaware I look like an idiot." [...] Most of her songs are helmed from personal experiences in her life as well as friends' experiences.|$|E

2500|$|After her diagnosis, the {{following}} {{issue of the}} National Enquirer ran the headline: [...] "Gilda Radner In Life-Death Struggle". [...] Without asking for her comment, the publication asserted that she was dying. Radner wrote in It's Always Something: [...] "They found an old photo of me looking frightened from a 'Saturday Night Live' sketch and blew that up to make the point. What they did probably sold newspapers, {{but it had a}} devastating effect on my family <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends.</b> [...] It forced [...] Gene [...] to compose a press release to respond. [...] He said that I had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, had had surgery, and my prognosis was good. [...] The Enquirer doesn't like good news, so the Gilda Radner story stopped running." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trisha {{resides in}} Chennai {{with her mother}} and grandmother. Her mother tongue is Tamil, and she converses fluently in Hindi, French, and English. Her mother Uma Krishnan, had been offered various roles by several Tamil film makers and actors {{including}} Kamal Hassan, but turned them down, as she wanted to concentrate on Trisha's career. She accompanies Trisha on film shoots, events, and functions, and they have appeared together only in a commercial advertisement. About her relationship with her mother, Trisha remarks, [...] "She has been the pillar of my strength and has stood by me like a rock through thick and thin. Everyone in the industry <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> know how close I'm to my mom." [...] Trisha's father died in October 2012. On 23 January 2015 Trisha became engaged to Varun Manian, a Chennai-based businessman. In May 2015, she confirmed that the couple had ended their engagement.|$|E
2500|$|At a press conference, Hart defiantly stated, [...] "I {{said that}} I bend, but I don't break, and believe me, I'm not broken." [...] Hart {{identified}} the invasive media coverage, and its need to [...] "dissect" [...] him, as his reason for suspending his campaign, [...] "If someone's able {{to throw up}} a smokescreen and keep it up there long enough, you can't get your message across. You can't raise the money to finance a campaign; there's too much static, and you can't communicate....Clearly, under the present circumstances, this campaign cannot go on. I refuse to submit my family <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> and innocent people and myself to further rumors and gossip. It's simply an intolerable situation." [...] Hart paraphrased Thomas Jefferson and warned, [...] "I tremble for my country when I think we may, in fact, {{get the kind of}} leaders we deserve." [...] Hart later recalled, [...] "I watched journalists become animals, literally." ...|$|E

I have been very unjustly treated by these writers, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> are coming to the front in defense, as all the missions have done the same things, and all believe they are right. So also does Mr. Conger, who is our good friend. Do not be disturbed by anything you see in the papers. The correspondents jump on to the missionaries when they are out of matter, and news has been very scarce this winter.

2500|$|In March 2009, it was {{revealed}} that the singer was parting ways with Columbia Records. Speaking of her decision to leave, Rowland said, [...] "as a solo artist, I felt the need to explore new directions, new challenges, and new freedoms outside my comfort zone <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> and family at Columbia have been incredibly understanding about my evolution. I want to thank everyone at Columbia for the love and support they've shown and I will never forget how many good times we've had over the years." [...] It was also announced in March that Guetta was releasing [...] "When Love Takes Over", his collaboration with Rowland. The song went on to be a worldwide success for the duo. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said [...] "the success comes at an intriguing time in Rowland's career", having noted that she had landed a hosting job on Bravo's The Fashion Show and was in between labels.|$|E
2500|$|Another similar, {{though less}} spectacular, episode {{happened}} with 2005 Divac's {{attempt to take}} over the Večernje novosti, a Serbian high-circulation daily. He made an agreement with small shareholders {{to take over the}} company by means of registering a new company with joint capital, which would increase the share capital. However, the Serbian Government intervened and halted {{what should have been a}} mere technical move. [...] While the attempted takeover was a [...] "backdoor" [...] one indeed, it was legal and similar cases had already happened. The government ostensibly feared lack of control over the influential daily. Even though the Supreme Court of Serbia eventually ruled in Divac's favor, he withdrew from the contest, citing [...] "friendly advice" [...] by unnamed persons. Embittered, he decided to stop his attempts to invest in Serbia: [...] "All of this is ugly and I'm very upset... I realized that there's no place for me in Serbia <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> can meet me in Madrid from now on... In Serbia, some different rules are in effect, and I can't conceive them".|$|E
