The <b>Americans</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> arrest Ko but first allow Smiley up to twelve weeks to pursue Circus interests. Smiley quickly realises that Tiu, Ko's second-in-command, travelled to Shanghai six weeks before Ricardo's flight to meet with Ko's brother, Nelson, a high-ranking Chinese official and Soviet mole; Tiu was to arrange their rendezvous, through which Nelson would escape China.|$|E
25|$|On November 29, 2012, a House {{subcommittee}} met {{to consider}} replacing the dollar bill. This action took {{place after the}} seventh Government Accountability Office report on the subject. The latest report claimed that switching to dollar coins would save $4.4 billion over thirty years. However, according to polls, few <b>Americans</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> give up dollar bills. Recent budgets passed by Congress have included provisions to prevent the Treasury Department from spending any of its funds to redesign the one dollar bill, largely because of potential cost impacts on the vending machine industry.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1910s, the area of {{northeast}} Oklahoma around Tulsa flourished, including the Greenwood neighborhood, which {{came to be known}} as [...] "the Negro Wall Street" [...] (now commonly referred to as [...] "the Black Wall Street"). The area was home to several prominent black businessmen. Greenwood boasted a variety of thriving businesses that were very successful up until the Tulsa Race Riot. Not only did black <b>Americans</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> contribute to the success of their own shops, but there were also racial segregation laws that prevented them from shopping anywhere other than Greenwood. Following the riots, the area was rebuilt and thrived until the 1960s when desegregation allowed blacks to shop in areas from which they were previously restricted.|$|E

50|$|Many {{stories like}} the one {{published}} by Hearst were printed across the country blaming the Spanish military {{for the destruction of}} the USS Maine. These stories struck a chord with the American people stirring public opinion up into a divided frenzy, with a large group of <b>Americans</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> attack and another <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> wait for confirmation. The <b>Americans</b> that <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> attack <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> remove Spain from power in many of their colonies close to the U.S. Those easily persuaded by the Yellow Journalism eventually prevailed, and American troops were sent to Cuba.|$|R

5000|$|Another common {{stereotype}} is that <b>Americans</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "the world's policemen", {{believing that}} the entire world needs their help - even if this results in preemptive military intervention - because someone or something makes them inherently exceptional. This relatively recent stereotype spawned from Cold War and post-Cold War military interventions such as the Vietnam War and Iraq War, which many people opposed.|$|E
5000|$|Just {{as a lack}} {{of uranium}} ore impeded the German and Japanese {{attempts}} to make an atomic bomb, the <b>Americans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> maintain their monopoly against the Soviets.

50|$|The <b>Americans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{prosecute the}} murders, but were limited by {{international}} law to crimes {{against their own}} military personnel, or military or civilians of allies.

50|$|The {{aggressive}} {{foreign policy}} of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler in Germany after 1933 aroused fears {{of a new world}} war. <b>Americans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> keep out of it and in 1937 Congress passed an even more stringent Neutrality Act.

50|$|Alexander {{writes that}} Americans are ashamed of their racial history, and {{therefore}} avoid talking about race, or even class, so the terms used {{in her book}} may seem unfamiliar to many. <b>Americans</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> believe that everybody is capable of upward mobility, given enough effort {{on his or her}} part; this assumption forms a part of the national collective self-image. Alexander points out that a large percentage of African Americans are hindered by the discriminatory practices of an ostensibly colorblind criminal justice system, which end up creating an undercaste where upward mobility is severely constrained.|$|E

This publication became a key handbook for the thousands of <b>Americans</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> cross the continent. In the Civil War, Marcy became chief of staff to his son-in-law George B.

50|$|The {{legal issue}} of same sex unions may be {{attributed}} to sexual stigmatization. Marriage gives legal recognition of partnership and rights to resources and protections. Survey data indicates that large numbers of lesbian, gay, and bisexual <b>Americans</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> marry if given opportunity and many have done so, including those registered in domestic partnership or civil unions. Civil unions and domestic partnerships are huge advancements but are undermining to marriage. Same-sex marriage in the United States was not recognized federally until June 2013.

5000|$|The Brookings Institution {{advocated}} a government-facilitated solution in which Big Three assets are transferred or sold to other firms {{better able to}} deploy the plant and employee resources. [...] "The most constructive role the government can play {{at this point is}} to provide a short-term infusion of capital with strict repayment rules that will essentially require the auto makers to sell off their assets to other, successful companies." [...] The authors argued that the Big Three make automobiles that not enough <b>Americans</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> buy, which cannot be solved by a bankruptcy restructuring focused initially on cost-side considerations like wages and benefits.|$|E

[...] Augustina Lindlbauer, the manager of an area guesthouse, noted that the area had lakes, forests, and vistas worth visiting, {{but there was an}} [...] "obsession with Fucking".

50|$|The {{operation}} {{had some}} initial success {{but the effect}} that the <b>Americans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> achieve did not happen.

The bread surprisingly was not donated because of its health benefits, but because <b>Americans</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> divest excess wheat to foreign markets to increase their profits. The milk meanwhile was chosen for its ability to quickly bolster underfed children.|$|R
