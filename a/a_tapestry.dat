5|$|After {{dinner on}} 8 September, the guests at Tranby Croft listened to music from Ethel Lycett Green until about 11pm, when the prince {{suggested}} {{a game of}} baccarat. Although the Wilsons {{did not have a}} suitably-sized table, Stanley Wilson improvised, putting two card tables alongside the smoking room table—all of which were of differing sizes—and covered them with <b>a</b> <b>tapestry</b> cloth. Among the evening's players were the prince, who acted as dealer; Sassoon, who took the part of banker; and Gordon-Cumming. Sitting next to the last-named was Stanley Wilson, who was on Levett's left.|$|E
5|$|Gertrude summons Hamlet to {{her room}} to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has {{possession}} of his ill-gotten goods: his brother's crown and wife. He sinks to his knees. Hamlet, {{on his way to}} visit his mother, sneaks up behind him, but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while his father's ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind <b>a</b> <b>tapestry,</b> makes a noise.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the second}} and third Macedonian wars Rome faced further {{conflict}} in the region due to <b>a</b> <b>tapestry</b> of shifting rivalries, alliances and leagues all seeking to gain greater influence. After the Macedonians had been defeated in the Second Macedonian War in 197 BC, the Greek city-state of Sparta stepped into the partial power vacuum in Greece. Fearing the Spartans would take increasing control of the region, the Romans drew on help from allies to prosecute the Roman-Spartan War, defeating a Spartan army at the Battle of Gythium in 195 BC. They also fought their former allies the Aetolian League in the Aetolian War, against the Istrians in the Istrian War, against the Illyrians in the Illyrian War, and against Achaia in the Achaean War.|$|E
5|$|On the upper-left side of what {{is today}} {{considered}} {{the back of the}} vessel, the mask of young Pan {{can be seen in the}} tree. Below, a goat is reaching for ripened grapes. Behind the goat lies fruit and a table, most likely an anclabris with five ceremonial vessels on top. On the left side of the table stands a small female figure, whose lit torches represent the festivities and the orgies associated with the cult's rites. Frédéric de Clarac argued that the statues could very well symbolize either Telete or Ceres, two deities often associated with Dionysus. Above the table is <b>a</b> <b>tapestry</b> and two bacchante masks. To the right, in an apple tree, another mask of Pan can be seen. Two more bacchante masks are present on the bottom, in front of the table.|$|E
5|$|Rendered {{unable to}} speak because of her injuries, Philomela wove <b>a</b> <b>tapestry</b> (or a robe) that told her story and had it sent to Procne. Procne was incensed and in revenge, she killed her son by Tereus, Itys (or Itylos), boiled him and served him as a meal to her husband. After Tereus ate Itys, the sisters {{presented}} him with the severed head of his son, and {{he became aware of}} their conspiracy and his cannibalistic meal. He snatched up an axe and pursued them with the intent to kill the sisters. They fled but were almost overtaken by Tereus at Daulia in Phocis. In desperation, they prayed to the gods to be turned into birds and escape Tereus' rage and vengeance. The gods transformed Procne into a swallow and Philomela into a nightingale. Subsequently, the gods would transform Tereus into a hoopoe.|$|E

5|$|The De Beatis description, only rediscovered by Steppe in the 1960s, cast {{new light}} on the {{commissioning}} of a work that was previously thoughtsince it has no central religious imageto be an atypical altarpiece. Many Netherlandish diptychs intended for private use are known, and even a few triptychs, but the Bosch panels are unusually large compared with these and contain no donor portraits. Possibly they were commissioned to celebrate a wedding, as large Italian paintings for private houses frequently were. Nevertheless, The Gardens bold depictions do not rule out a church commission, such was the contemporaneous fervor to warn against immorality. In 1566, the triptych served as the model for <b>a</b> <b>tapestry</b> that hangs at El Escorial monastery near Madrid.|$|E
5|$|The cloisters were {{restored}} in the 20thcentury, and {{the stained glass}} windows contain the images of some 130saints. The cloister garth contains a modern sculpture entitled The water of life by Stephen Broadbent. The refectory roof is dated 1939 and was designed by F.H.Crossley. The east window with reticulated tracery was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott and is dated 1913. The stained glass in the west window, depicting the Creation, was designed by Ros Grimshaw and installed in 2001 to celebrate the Millennium. On the refectory's west wall there is <b>a</b> <b>tapestry</b> depicting Elymas being struck with blindness which was woven at Mortlake in the 17thcentury from a cartoon by Raphael. The heraldic paintings on the north wall represent {{the arms of the}} Earls of Chester.|$|E
5|$|Expensive and {{elaborate}} ornamentation {{was an important}} part of a ship's appearance in the 1660s, even though it had been simplified since the early 17th century. Such ornamentation was believed to enhance the authority of absolute monarchs and to portray the ship as a symbol of martial prowess and royal authority. There are no contemporary illustrations of the ornamentation of Kronan, but according to common practice it was most lavish on the transom, the flat surface facing aft. There are two images of Kronan shown from the stern by two Danish artists. Both works were commissioned many years after the sinking to commemorate the Danish victory. Claus Møinichen's painting at Fredriksborg Palace from 1686 shows a transom dominated by two lions rampant holding up a huge royal crown. The background is blue with sculptures and ornaments in gold. Swedish art historian Hans Soop, who has previously studied the sculptures of Vasa, a prestige ship of Gustavus Adolphus's navy that sank only 20 minutes into her maiden voyage in Stockholm in 1628, has suggested that Møinichen may have intentionally exaggerated the size of the ship to enhance the Danish victory. <b>A</b> <b>tapestry</b> at Rosenborg Castle shows Kronan as a two-decker with a crown motif that is even larger than Møinichen's painting.|$|E
