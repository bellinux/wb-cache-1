5|$|The postwar climate sees {{a period}} of {{austerity}} and mistrust towards the machines. Returning from {{the horrors of the}} war, Marke becomes the Consul of Berlin and instates a reign of isolation and deurbanization. Advanced weapons <b>are</b> <b>destroyed,</b> people are driven out into the countryside to cultivate the land, and the giant energy accumulators <b>are</b> <b>destroyed.</b> Columns made to look like bulls are erected in city squares and at crossroads, and roar twice a day like a dying animal to remind people of the catastrophe of the Ural War. Marduk succeeds Marke as the Consul and continues the period of brutal authoritarian rule.|$|E

This makes the retention controversy moot since the virus can be easily recreated even if all samples <b>are</b> <b>destroyed.</b> Although the scientists performed the research to help development of new vaccines as well as trace smallpox's history, the possibility of the techniques being used for nefarious purposes was immediately recognized, leading to new regulation questions.|$|E
5|$|In Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties, {{the three}} new civilizations must build a Wonder to advance from age to age, instead of {{advancing}} from the Town Center. Unlike previous Age of Empires games, the player does not achieve victory {{by building a}} wonder. Players can choose from a selection of wonders, each having benefits unique to their civilization. Once built, this wonder provides an initial bonus of units or resources, while continuing to provide a benefit to the player's civilization. This initial bonus becomes larger, depending on which age is being advanced to. Since the wonder is a building, players can assign different numbers of villagers to build it, which affects the speed of advancement. Wonders that <b>are</b> <b>destroyed</b> cannot be rebuilt.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Osea was {{extremely}} destructive {{to some of}} the islands in French Polynesia. Over 700homes <b>were</b> <b>destroyed</b> or severely damaged on Maupiti, Bora-Bora, and Raiatea. Several roofs were blown off of buildings across the archipelago. On Maupiti, an island with a population of 1,100, about 95% of the infrastructure <b>was</b> <b>destroyed.</b> The town hall, twoschools, and an airfield <b>were</b> <b>destroyed.</b> The town hall was originally being used as an emergency shelter, but was later evacuated due to strong winds and <b>was</b> later <b>destroyed.</b> Furthermore, many roadways and highways were blocked due to flooding.

5|$|Nevertheless, several {{woodpeckers}} {{are under}} threat as their habitats <b>are</b> <b>destroyed.</b> Being woodland birds, deforestation and clearance {{of land for}} agriculture and other purposes can reduce populations dramatically. Some species adapt to living in plantations and secondary growth, or to open countryside with forest remnants and scattered trees, but some do not. A few species have even flourished when they have adapted to man-made habitats. There are few conservation projects directed primarily at woodpeckers, but they benefit whenever their habitat is conserved. The red-cockaded woodpecker {{has been the focus}} of much conservation effort in the southeastern United States, with artificial cavities being constructed in the longleaf pines they favour as nesting sites.|$|E
5|$|Niko and Roman are {{immediately}} {{forced to flee}} to Bohan after their apartment and taxi company <b>are</b> <b>destroyed</b> by Dimitri's men in arson attacks.

50|$|Wetlands {{and marine}} areas have endured {{high levels of}} habitat destruction. More than 50% of {{wetlands}} in the U.S. have <b>been</b> <b>destroyed</b> {{in just the last}} 200 years. Between 60% and 70% of European wetlands have <b>been</b> completely <b>destroyed.</b> About one-fifth (20%) of marine coastal areas have been highly modified by humans. One-fifth of coral reefs have also <b>been</b> <b>destroyed,</b> and another fifth has been severely degraded by overfishing, pollution, and invasive species; 90% of the Philippines’ coral reefs alone have <b>been</b> <b>destroyed.</b> Finally, over 35% mangrove ecosystems worldwide have <b>been</b> <b>destroyed.</b>|$|R

Near the Pungwe River, a road that connected Mozambique to Zimbabwe <b>was</b> <b>destroyed.</b> Many nearby homes and fields <b>were</b> <b>destroyed,</b> forcing numerous families to seek shelter. Throughout the nation of Mozambique, large portions of the maize, potatoes, tomatoes, cucumber, and pumpkin crops were washed away due to flooding.|$|R
5|$|September 14, 1944 — The 1944 Great Atlantic {{hurricane}} makes landfall on Long Island as a category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale {{at a high}} {{forward speed}} of 40mph (64km/h). Wind gusts of well over 100mph (160km/h) breaks previous wind records in New York City, while a minimum pressure reading of 28.47inches is recorded on Long Island. 117homes are completely destroyed, while 2,427are severely damaged and almost 1000businesses <b>are</b> <b>destroyed</b> or damaged. In all, six people are killed, and one person is injured.|$|E
5|$|September 15, 2003- Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Tropical Storm Henri produce heavy rainfall over portions of Delaware, including a peak of 9.02inches (229mm) in Hockessin. The flooding damages hundreds of houses, and traps motorists in submerged vehicles. Several bridges <b>are</b> <b>destroyed</b> or damaged due to rising flood waters, including the Red Clay Creek which peaks at 17.27feet (5.2m). Damage totals $16.1million (2003USD, $18.9million 2008USD). Due to the damage, President George W. Bush declares the state a disaster area.|$|E
5|$|The {{parasite}} {{is relatively}} protected from {{attack by the}} body's immune system because {{for most of its}} human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells <b>are</b> <b>destroyed</b> in the spleen. To avoid this fate, the P.falciparum parasite displays adhesive proteins {{on the surface of the}} infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen. The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria. Sequestered red blood cells can breach the blood–brain barrier and cause cerebral malaria.|$|E

5|$|This species' {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} shallow water is naturally susceptible to {{problems such as}} drought or the encroachment of vegetation, but this duck's habitat might be increasingly threatened by climate change. Populations are also affected by the conversion of wetlands and grassland to arable crops, depriving the duck of feeding and nesting areas. Spring planting means that many nests of this early breeding duck <b>are</b> <b>destroyed</b> by farming activities, and a Canadian study showed {{that more than half}} of the surveyed nests were destroyed by agricultural work such as ploughing and harrowing.|$|E
5|$|Apoptosis is a {{controlled}} {{process in which}} the cell's structural components <b>are</b> <b>destroyed,</b> resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} continues, {{several of the}} vessels <b>are</b> <b>destroyed</b> by explosions. The Doctor {{suspects}} that the crew aboard the Buccaneer, a 17th-century pirate ship, responsible {{as it was the}} closest vessel at the time of destruction. Turlough, while attempting to escape control of the Black Guardian, ends up aboard the Buccaneer, and meets the Eternal Captain Wrack, learning she too is working for the Black Guardian. He finds equipment aboard her ship that appears to be the source of the device destroying the other ships and hears the Black Guardian's voice nearby. Later, Wrack offers the Edwardian officers a reception aboard her ship. During the reception, Turlough demonstrates the equipment to the Doctor, while Wrack gifts Tegan with a tiara with a red crystal. After the reception and continuation of the race, the Doctor sees the Buccaneer nearing the Edwardian ship, and determines that the red crystal is used as a focal point of the weapon, and gets rid of the tiara before Wrack can destroy the ship.|$|E
