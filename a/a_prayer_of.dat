25|$|Other prayers honouring Mary's immaculate {{conception}} are in use outside the formal liturgy. The hymn Immaculate Mary, addressed to Mary as the Immaculately Conceived One, is {{closely associated with}} Lourdes. The Immaculata prayer, composed by Saint Maximillian Kolbe, is <b>a</b> <b>prayer</b> <b>of</b> entrustment to Mary as the Immaculata.

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>prayer</b> <b>of</b> {{petition}} is {{a request}} to God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give definite form to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention on what we have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of <b>a</b> <b>prayer</b> <b>of</b> petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of {{the view}} that the prayer is {{secondary}} argue that (1) the context requires <b>a</b> <b>prayer</b> <b>of</b> illumination and not a communal confession of sin, and (2) {{the beginning and end of}} the prayer are marked by duplications in verses 3-4a and verses 20-21a that are most plausibly interpreted as redactional seams. However, these considerations have not proved decisive, and arguments in favor of the prayer's authenticity have also been advanced. In particular, the concluding passage in verses 20-27 contains several allusions to the language in the prayer, suggesting that it was included purposefully by the author(s) of the chapter, even if it was not originally composed by the same author(s).|$|E

Goren was on hand during the capture of East Jerusalem on 7 June 1967, where he gave <b>a</b> <b>prayer</b> <b>of</b> thanksgiving broadcast live to the entire country. Shortly afterwards Goren, blowing a shofar and carrying a Torah scroll, held the first Jewish prayer session at the Western Wall since 1948. The event was one of the defining moments of the war, and several photographs of Goren, surrounded by soldiers in prayer, have since become famous around the world and particularly in Israel. The most famous photograph shows Goren blowing the Shofar against the background of the Western Wall.|$|E
25|$|The ritual book on {{pastoral}} {{care of the}} sick provides three rites: anointing outside Mass, anointing within Mass, and anointing in a hospital or institution. The rite of anointing outside Mass begins with a greeting by the priest, followed by sprinkling of all present with holy water, if deemed desirable, and a short instruction. There follows a penitential act, as {{at the beginning of}} Mass. If the sick person wishes to receive the sacrament of penance, it is preferable that the priest make himself available for this during a previous visit; but if the sick person must confess during the celebration of the sacrament of anointing, this confession replaces the penitential rite A passage of Scripture is read, and the priest may give a brief explanation of the reading, a short litany is said, and the priest lays his hands on the head of the sick person and then says <b>a</b> <b>prayer</b> <b>of</b> thanksgiving over the already blessed oil or, if necessary, blesses the oil himself.|$|E
500|$|The {{philosophical}} album closer [...] "Africa" [...] celebrates D'Angelo's heritage, while reaffirming his contemporary {{mission in}} life. It {{has been cited}} by Questlove as his favorite song on the album. The theme of [...] "Africa" [...] concerns the finding of a spiritual home amid geographical displacement, and of passing that sense of belonging on to one's children. [...] "Africa" [...] was originally written in honor of D'Angelo's son, Michael Archer, Jr., and ended up as a dedication to history, Africa, and God. Opening with a shimmery rustle of chimes, the song contains a drum interpretation of Prince's [...] "I Wonder U" [...] from his Parade (1986), which was also utilized for the Ursula Rucker and The Roots track [...] "The Return to Innocence Lost" [...] from Things Fall Apart. Questlove discussed producing the opening chime sounds for [...] "Africa", stating [...] "we took the cover off the rhodes and mic'd 'em". One critic described C. Edward Alford's guitar work for [...] "Africa" [...] as [...] "backward guitar solos (at least they sound backward)". Another critic described the song as a [...] "lullaby" [...] and [...] "a gorgeous, opalescent closer ... <b>a</b> <b>prayer</b> <b>of</b> sorts". Voodoos coda, which consists of chopped-up track snippets run backwards, plays at the song's conclusion.|$|E

500|$|In 1915, Marquis Stanislas de La Rochethulon (1862–1945), {{founding}} {{president of}} the Anglo-French association Souvenir Normand (Norman Remembrance), which called itself [...] "a work of peace and justice inspired by the testament of William the Conqueror, who {{is considered to be}} the ancestor of all the royal families of Europe", sent this prayer to Pope Benedict XV in the midst of World War I. The Pope had an Italian translation published {{on the front page of}} L'Osservatore Romano on 20 January 1916. It appeared under the heading, [...] "The prayers of 'Souvenir Normand' for peace", with a jumbled explanation: [...] "'Souvenir Normand' has sent the Holy Father the text of some prayers for peace. We have pleasure in presenting in particular the prayer addressed to the Sacred Heart, inspired by the testament of William the Conqueror." [...] On 28 January 1916, the newspaper La Croix reprinted, in French, the article from L'Osservatore Romano, with exactly the same heading and explanation. La Rochethulon wrote to La Croix to clarify that it was not <b>a</b> <b>prayer</b> <b>of</b> Souvenir Normand; but he failed to mention La Clochette, the first publication in which it had appeared. Because of its appearance in L'Osservatore Romano and La Croix as a simple prayer for peace during World War I, the prayer became widely known.|$|E
500|$|The Byrds' {{recording}} of the song opens with a distinctive, Bach-inspired guitar introduction played by McGuinn and then, like Dylan's version, goes into the song's chorus. Although Dylan's version contains four verses, The Byrds only perform the song's second verse and two repeats of the chorus, followed by {{a variation on the}} song's introduction, which then fades out. The Byrds' arrangement of the song had been shortened during the band's rehearsals at World Pacific Studios in 1964, at the suggestion of Jim Dickson, in order to accommodate commercial radio stations, which were reluctant to play songs that were over two-and-a-half minutes long. Thus, while Dylan's version is five-and-a-half minutes long, The Byrds' runs just short of two-and-a-half minutes. The lead vocal on The Byrds' version of [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] was sung by McGuinn, who attempted to modify his singing style to fill what he perceived as a gap in the popular music scene of the day, somewhere between the vocal sound of John Lennon and Bob Dylan. The song also took on a spiritual aspect for McGuinn during the recording sessions, as he told The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan in 1997: [...] "I was singing to God and I was saying that God was the Tambourine Man and I was saying to him, 'Hey, God, take me for a trip and I'll follow you.' It was <b>a</b> <b>prayer</b> <b>of</b> submission." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{official}} {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World states: [...] "Jack Thorne, a young artist, finds his efforts unappreciated, {{and he and his}} wife and little daughter {{are on the verge of}} starvation. The final blow comes when his last painting, on which he had built much hope, was rejected by a rich man, whom an artist chum kindly brought to the impoverished studio. Jack decides that he can struggle no longer. Unseen by his wife, he picks up his revolver, puts it in his pocket and goes out, intending to end everything. But his little daughter has watched him; she follows him and stays his hand. Her prayers and entreaties bring him to a realization of what his rash act would mean to the two helpless ones that would be left behind. Penitent and remorseful, he accompanies his child back to their poor home. There he confesses to his wife that it was only the child's timely interference that saved him from ending it all. The mother drops on her knees beside her child, and clasping her in her arms, raises grateful eyes to Heaven in <b>a</b> <b>prayer</b> <b>of</b> thankfulness. Jack, looking up suddenly, sees the beautiful group of mother and child, with a light as if from Heaven upon them. Realizing that [...] is the inspiration and subject for which he has sought in vain, he calls for them not to move, and at once begins his great painting of them, which brings him fame and wealth." ...|$|E
