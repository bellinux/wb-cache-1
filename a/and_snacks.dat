5|$|In {{the wake}} of the tornado {{outbreak}} law enforcement officers, including 30 national guard troops, were sent to Lone Grove to provide security. The American Red Cross opened shelters in Ardmore, Edmond, and Oklahoma City. About 100 volunteers from the Sorghum Mill Estates Neighborhood Association traveled to affected areas in Edmond to help with cleanup efforts. A local restaurant provided free meals to the volunteers as they assisted relief workers. The Salvation Army had two canteens in Oklahoma City, one in Lone Grove, and one in Perkins. About 2,000 meals, drinks, <b>and</b> <b>snacks</b> were provided by the Salvation Army to emergency responders. Feed the Children sent two truckloads of relief supplies to Carter County. They also sent three food trucks, containing a total of 619 meals, 900 drinks, and about 500 snacks, to Ardmore. On February22, the New Life Baptist Church sent drinks and prepackaged snacks, along with items needed for clean-up. Baptist Disaster Relief assisted in Lone Grove with food and emotional care. The Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA) gave away two tickets to anyone who made a donation of $25 or an equivalent amount of food to benefit victims of the tornado. A concert featuring Chris Cagle and other local musicians at Heritage Hall in Ardmore raised over $18,000 to benefit Carter County tornado victims.

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{association}} of adolescents' <b>snack</b> <b>and</b> soft drink consumption with friendship group <b>snack</b> <b>and</b> soft drink consumption, availability of <b>snacks</b> <b>and</b> soft drinks at school, <b>and</b> personal characteristics, <b>snack</b> <b>and</b> soft drink consumption was assessed in 749 adolescents (398 girls, 351 boys, age 12. 4 - 17. 6 years), and their friends, <b>and</b> <b>snack</b> <b>and</b> soft drink availability at schools was measured. In regression analysis, consumption by friends, <b>snack</b> <b>and</b> soft drink availability within school, and personal characteristics (age, gender, education level, body mass index) were examined as determinants of <b>snack</b> <b>and</b> drink consumption. <b>Snack</b> <b>and</b> soft drink consumption was higher in boys, soft drink consumption was higher in lower educated adolescents, <b>and</b> <b>snack</b> consumption was higher in adolescents with a lower body weight. Peer group <b>snack</b> <b>and</b> soft drink consumption were associated with individual intake, particularly when availability in the canteen and vending machines was high. The association between individual <b>and</b> peer <b>snack</b> consumption was strong in boys, adolescents with a lower education level, and adolescents with lower body weights. Our study shows that individual <b>snack</b> <b>and</b> soft drink consumption is associated with specific combinations of consumption by peers, availability at school, and personal characteristics...|$|R

Ann's accountant brother Brian Souter joined the firm and expanded the business into bus hire. Robin Gloag subsequently sold his shareholding in the business and ceased any involvement in 1982 with the collapse of his marriage to Ann. The Transport Act 1980, which freed express services of 35 miles and over from regulation by the Traffic Commissioner, brought new opportunities for the Perth based company and services were launched from Dundee to London using second-hand Neoplan coaches. For a while, they offered a very personal service with Brian Souter doing the driving and Ann Gloag making up sandwiches <b>and</b> <b>snacks</b> for the passengers.|$|E
