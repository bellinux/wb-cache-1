5|$|Following an {{off-season}} {{marred by}} financial difficulties {{that resulted in}} wage cuts {{for a number of}} riders, the 2005 spring season was the strongest yet for CSC, with wins by Julich and Jens Voigt. Julich's victory in Paris–Nice made him the first rider to wear the leader's jersey in the new UCI ProTour. This was followed by three team stage wins in the Giro d'Italia, one by David Zabriskie and two by Basso, though the overall victory escaped from Basso when he was beset by <b>a</b> <b>stomach</b> ailment.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, at school, Bart {{does not}} want to take a test, so he fakes <b>a</b> <b>stomach</b> ache. Mrs. Edna Krabappel asks if Bart has ever read The Boy Who Cried Wolf.

He begins to take her advice on ways to cheer everyone up around the plant by playing the music of Tom Jones over the plant's speakers, which further depresses the employees.|$|E

5|$|Sea anemones {{have what}} can be {{described}} as an incomplete gut; the gastrovascular cavity functions as <b>a</b> <b>stomach</b> and possesses a single opening to the outside, which operates as both a mouth and anus. Waste and undigested matter is excreted through this opening. The mouth is typically slit-like in shape, and bears a groove at one or both ends. The groove, termed a siphonophore, is ciliated, and helps to move food particles inwards and circulate water through the gastrovascular cavity.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} his death has been debated. Napoleon's physician, François Carlo Antommarchi, led the autopsy, which found {{the cause of death}} to be stomach cancer. Antommarchi did not sign the {{official}} report. Napoleon's father had died of stomach cancer, although this was seemingly unknown {{at the time of the}} autopsy. Antommarchi found evidence of <b>a</b> <b>stomach</b> ulcer; this was the most convenient explanation for the British, who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of Napoleon.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} rare {{case of an}} elderly patient with an {{advanced}} gastric cancer arising from <b>an</b> upside-down <b>stomach</b> through <b>a</b> paraesophageal hiatal hernia (PEH). An 82 -year-old man presented with appetite loss and anemia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a type 1 tumor located in the middle body of the stomach. An upper gastrointestinal series and computed tomography showed organoaxial rotation of the stomach, which was located in the mediastinum, through a PEH, indicating <b>an</b> upside-down <b>stomach.</b> The preoperative diagnosis was gastric cancer arising from <b>an</b> upside-down <b>stomach</b> through <b>a</b> PEH. The patient underwent total gastrectomy with lymph node dissection and closure of the hernial orifice. Although a large PEH is a chronic disorder, gastric malignancies {{should be considered in}} patients with PEH manifested as <b>an</b> upside-down <b>stomach</b> due to its anatomical characteristics, and careful preoperative diagnosis is mandatory...|$|R

5|$|After the 23 July {{show at the}} Day on the Green festival at the Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, California, Bonham {{and members}} of Led Zeppelin's support staff were arrested after a member of {{promoter}} Bill Graham's staff was badly beaten during the band's performance. The following day's second Oakland concert was the group's final live appearance in the United States. Two days later, as they checked in at a French Quarter hotel for their 30 July performance at the Louisiana Superdome, Plant received news that his five-year-old son, Karac, had died from <b>a</b> <b>stomach</b> virus. The rest of the tour was immediately cancelled, prompting widespread speculation about Led Zeppelin's future.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{started his}} {{season in the}} Brisbane International as the {{defending}} champion, despite having a virus when the tournament started. However, in a rematch of the previous year's final, he lost in the final to Milos Raonic in straight sets. Federer then participated at the 2016 Australian Open and rebounded from his third round defeat by Andreas Seppi in 2015 by reaching the semifinals but lost to eventual champion Novak Djokovic in four sets. The day after his loss to Djokovic, Federer sustained a knee injury and in early February, he underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his knee and missed the tournaments in Rotterdam, Dubai and Indian Wells in February and March. He was scheduled to return to action in Miami. Due to <b>a</b> <b>stomach</b> virus he had to withdraw from Miami thus prolonging his time on the sidelines.|$|E
5|$|Flick {{began his}} career in semi-professional {{baseball}} and played in minor league baseball for two years. He was noticed by George Stallings, {{the manager of the}} Phillies, who signed Flick as a reserve outfielder. Flick was pressed into a starting role in 1898 when an injury forced another player to retire. He excelled as a starter. Flick jumped to the Athletics in 1902, but an court injunction prevented him from playing in Pennsylvania. He joined the Naps, where he continued to play for the remainder of his major league career, which was curtailed by <b>a</b> <b>stomach</b> ailment.|$|E

5|$|In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, {{receiving}} vital colostrum milk. Lambs {{that either}} fail to nurse or are prevented {{from doing so}} by the ewe require aid in order to live. If coaxing the pair to accept nursing does not work, one of several steps may then be taken. Ewes may be held or tied {{to force them to}} accept a nursing lamb. If a lamb is not eating, <b>a</b> <b>stomach</b> tube may also be used to force feed the lamb in order to save its life. In the case of a permanently rejected lamb, a shepherd may then attempt to foster an orphaned lamb onto another ewe. Lambs are also sometimes fostered after the death of their mother, either from the birth or other event.|$|E
5|$|In {{the thirteenth}} {{stage of the}} 1967 Tour de France, Simpson {{collapsed}} and died during the ascent of Mont Ventoux. He was 29 years old. The post-mortem examination found that he had mixed amphetamines and alcohol; this diuretic combination proved fatal when combined with the heat, the hard climb of the Ventoux and <b>a</b> <b>stomach</b> complaint. A memorial near where he died has become a place of pilgrimage for many cyclists. Simpson was known to have taken performance-enhancing drugs during his career, when no doping controls existed. He is held in high esteem by many cyclists for his character and will to win.|$|E

Chelsea won the Premier League, only their second English top-flight championship and their first in 50 years, and the League Cup. Later, Drogba scored in extra time in a 3–2 final win against Liverpool at the Millennium Stadium, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League. Drogba scored a somewhat disappointing 16 goals in a total of 40 games for Chelsea in his first season: ten in the Premier League, five in the Champions League and one in the League Cup final.|$|E
