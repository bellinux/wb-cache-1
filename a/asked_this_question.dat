[...] He was taken to New York, where due to his rank he was permitted to go at large on his parole. [...] During this time in New York, it was common for British officers to amuse themselves by insulting American prisoners with pointed questions such as [...] "What Trade were you of before you entered the service?"

500|$|Jason {{has been}} {{referenced}} or parodied in other films. In the film Scream, directed by Freddy Krueger creator Wes Craven, actress Drew Barrymore's character is being stalked by a killer who calls {{her on her}} home phone. In order to survive, she must answer the man's trivia questions. One question is [...] "name the killer in Friday the 13th." [...] She incorrectly guesses Jason, who did not become the killer for the film series until Part 2. Writer Kevin Williamson claimed his inspiration for this scene came when he <b>asked</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> in a bar while a group was playing a movie trivia quiz game. He received a free drink, because nobody got the answer right. In another Wes Craven film, Cursed, a wax sculpture of Jason, from Jason Goes to Hell, {{can be seen in}} a wax museum. [...] In 2014, Jason made a cameo appearance in the RadioShack Super Bowl XLVIII commercial [...] "The '80s Called".|$|E

2500|$|In 2007 {{during the}} Kid's Music Special, the {{question}} [...] "What children's song {{is contained in}} the song Down Under?"

The lawsuit was over the main flute riff that accompanies the line from children's nursery rhyme Kookaburra which Larrikin Music alleged was reproduced in the Men at Work song Down Under. The lawsuit ruled in favour of Larrikin Music.|$|E

[...] This kept occurring until Pepperberg said [...] "Fine, what color five?" [...] Alex replied [...] "none". This was said to suggest that parrots, like children, get bored. Sometimes, Alex answered the questions incorrectly, despite knowing the correct answer.|$|E
2500|$|After being detained, Lindh first {{said that}} he was Irish. While being interviewed by the CIA, he did not reveal that he was American. Spann asked Lindh, [...] "Are you a member of the IRA?" [...] He was <b>asked</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> because, when {{questioned}} by Spann, an Iraqi in the group identified Lindh as an English speaker. Lindh had been told to say he was [...] "Irish" [...] in order to avoid problems. Moments later, around 11am, the makeshift prison was the scene of a violent Taliban uprising, which became known as the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi. Spann and hundreds of foreign fighters were killed; only 86 prisoners survived. According to other detainees interviewed by the journalist Robert Young Pelton for CNN, Lindh was fully aware of the planned uprising, yet remained silent and did not cooperate with the Americans.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{the early}} {{phases of the}} project, many people {{claiming}} to have psychic powers presented themselves to the lab. The vast majority quickly proved to have no such ability, or, just as commonly, used sleight of hand to make their [...] "abilities" [...] work. Many of these were convinced {{what they were doing}} was [...] "real". However, after a short while it became apparent that two young men, Steve Shaw and Michael Edwards, were much more successful, and the lab started to focus their energies on them. In fact, the two young men were [...] "plants", friends of Randi whom he had met some time before as part of his magician's trade. Part of Randi's instructions to these men was to tell the truth if they were ever asked whether they were faking the results; they were never <b>asked</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> directly. The researchers assumed that the participants would have no qualms about lying in their answer to a straightforward question if they were also lying about their abilities.|$|E
2500|$|The slogan [...] "Free a Marine to Fight" [...] {{proved to}} be a strong drawing card for the WR, {{stronger}} than any fashioned by the WAC, Waves, or SPARS. Young women were eager to serve in the military during World WarII, often in defiance of their family's wishes. Marian Bauer's parents were so upset when she joined the corps that they did not see her off. Jane Tailor's father, a World War I veteran, gave her this advice: [...] "Don't ever complain to me. You're doing this of your own free will. You weren't drafted or forced. Now, golearn, travel, and do your job {{to the best of your}} ability." [...] And there were those parents who asked special consideration for daughters who were too young to enlist. The minimum age of 20 years, set by law, remained the same throughout the war for the WR. Some parents wondered why 18-year-boys were sent into combat and 18-year-old girls could not even serve. Aside from patriotism, Colonel Streeter was interested to learn the reasons why young women joined the WR. A survey of 1,000 new enlistees was conducted at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, which <b>asked</b> <b>this</b> <b>question.</b> The results of this survey showed that the 750 enlistees had had positive reasons for enlisting. Some had male relatives or friends in the armed forces, and some wanted revenge against the enemy, while others wanted the experience it would bring to their lives. The remaining 250 acknowledged they were trying to escape from something: a bad home life, a broken marriage, boredom, or some personal disappointment. Indications were that Streeter was not displeased with the findings. The WR met its recruitment goal by 1June 1944, and then stopped all recruiting. It began again on 20September 1944, but on a limited basis. The peak strength was 17,640 enlisted and 820 officers.|$|E
