25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, Sutherland had already established a reputation as a diva with a voice out of the ordinary. She sang Lucia to great acclaim in Paris in 1960 and, in 1961, at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera. In 1960, she sang a superb Alcina at La Fenice, Venice, where she was nicknamed La Stupenda ("The Stunning One"). Lucia di Lammermoor generated so much excitement that standees began lining up at 7:30 that morning. Her singing of the Mad Scene drew <b>a</b> <b>thunderous</b> 12-minute ovation. Sutherland would soon be praised as La Stupenda in newspapers around the world. Later that year (1960), Sutherland sang Alcina at the Dallas Opera, with which she made her US debut.|$|E
25|$|His intense {{work ethic}} and {{athletic}} physique gave him the ability to consistently make highlight-reel plays, such as applying defensive intensity, forcing a turnover, stealing the ball and starting a one-man fast break that he would finish with <b>a</b> <b>thunderous</b> slam dunk. As Pippen himself has attested, he and Jordan would compete to see who could force more turnovers and produce more offense from defense in each game (fast break points). During the 1990 Slam Dunk Contest, Pippen exhibited his leaping ability with a dunk from the free throw line. He was an athletic finisher at the rim, both with dunks and a skillful finger roll that he added to his skill set over time. He was also a prolific perimeter shooter, taking about three thousand and making almost one thousand three-pointers in his career.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the run-up to UEFA Euro 2000 that he gained acclaim, with the tournament itself {{providing}} the platform some of his finest performances. His raw pace and acceleration down the flank, coupled with his ability to function both as a wing-forward and as a wing-back made him a versatile player {{to have in the}} squad. His man of the match performance in a friendly against Germany {{at the turn of the}} millennium cemented his position in the national team – he set up the opening goal for Patrick Kluivert, then added his own name to the scoresheet with <b>a</b> <b>thunderous</b> volley from Ronald de Boer's corner, before nearly putting the gloss on the finish when he left the entire German defence for dead with his raw pace, beat the goalkeeper with his shot, only for it to rebound off the upright.|$|E

25|$|She and her troupe {{departed}} from Le Havre for America on 15 October 1880, arriving in New York on 27 October. On 8 November, she performed Scribe's Adrienne Lecouvreur at Booth's Theater {{before an audience}} which had paid a top price of $40 for a ticket, an enormous sum at the time. Few in the audience understood French, {{but it was not}} necessary; her gestures and voice captivated the audience, and she received <b>a</b> <b>thunderous</b> ovation. She thanked the audience with her distinctive curtain call; she did not bow, but stood perfectly still, with her hands clasped under her chin, or with her palms on her cheeks, and then suddenly stretched them out to the audience. After her first performance in New York, she made 27 curtain calls. Although she was welcomed by theater-goers, she was entirely ignored by New York high society, who considered her personal life scandalous.|$|E
25|$|In Game 1, LeBron James {{dominated}} with a 49-point performance, while Howard had 30. Early in the game, Howard made <b>a</b> <b>thunderous</b> jam {{that caused}} the shot clock to fall backwards. Although James had a potential game-winning three-point play, a furious rally and a game-winning three-pointer by Rashard Lewis allowed the Magic to escape with a victory in game 1. Much like Game 1, Game 2 had the Cavs with an 18-point lead by the second quarter, only for the Magic to rally back in the closing minutes. A jump shot by Hedo Türkoğlu gave the Magic a 2-point lead with 1 second left on the clock, but LeBron James hit a three-pointer to tie the series. In Game 3, the Magic dominated at home, leading to a 10-point victory behind Dwight Howard's 24 points. In Game 4, two clutch free throws by LeBron James sent the game into overtime. While James dominated with 44 (his third 40-point game of the playoffs), an off half-court shot allowed the Magic to escape again with a victory. Down 3–1, James' triple-double allowed his team to stave off elimination in Game 5. After a win in Game 6, the Magic received their second NBA Finals berth in franchise history.|$|E
25|$|Format in {{this tournament}} was {{same as the}} first one: four groups of three, then two groups of four in quarter-finals; top two into semi-finals. This {{competition}} was played in London, Lord's and Oval, and Nottingham. Out of the 10 full members, Zimbabwe withdrew its participation. Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland qualified for the tournament. It was full of surprise victories, as favourites fell {{at the hands of}} underdogs. The hosts, England, set the ball rolling in the first match of the tournament as they were embarrassed by Netherlands in a final-ball thriller. Australia were dominated by West Indies, largely thanks to <b>a</b> <b>thunderous</b> innings by Chris Gayle, as he hit 88 off 50 balls, including some of the largest sixes seen in England. Australia were then defeated by Sri Lanka, who bowled tightly and batted with dominance, including quick-fire half centuries from Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara. Ireland beat Bangladesh in the Group stage to qualify for the Super Eight. Previous champions, India, lost all its matches of the Super Eight Stage. South Africa hadn't lost a group stage match going into the semi-finals against Pakistan, but Shahid Afridi produced a match winning performance with both bat and ball. He blasted his way to 51 and bagged two wickets for 16 runs to secure victory. The final at Lord's was a repeat of a group stage match between Sri Lanka and Pakistan; the latter lost the previous encounter. Pakistan managed to remove Dilshan, the Player of the Series for his 317 runs, without scoring, which had a big impact on the Sri Lanka innings. Sangakkara put up a fight scoring an unbeaten 64, but a target of 138 wasn't going to be easy to defend. Afridi proved this to be correct, hitting an unbeaten 54, which helped Pakistan win the trophy with 8 balls to spare.|$|E

Ralph reads too much into Lisa's gesture and, much to Lisa's dismay, relentlessly pursues her with affection. Lisa snaps at Ralph and angrily tells him they are not together and that she never liked him. Heartbroken, Ralph channels his feelings into his performance as George Washington in the school's President's Day pageant. After <b>a</b> <b>thunderous</b> applause from the audience, he is able to accept Lisa as just a friend.|$|E

Richard Whitington wrote in the 1970s that McCabe's innings [...] "still warms {{the blood of the}} dwindling number of Australians who watched it". McCabe received <b>a</b> <b>thunderous</b> standing ovation from the 46,000 spectators.

500|$|The Oceanides (Finnish title: , {{translated}} to English as Nymphs of the Waves or Spirits of the Waves; original working title [...] in English, Rondo of the Waves), Op.73, is a single-movement tone poem for orchestra written in 1913–14 by the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius. The piece, {{which refers to}} the nymphs in Greek mythology who inhabited the Mediterranean Sea, premiered on 4June 1914 at the Norfolk Music Festival in Connecticut with Sibelius conducting. Praised upon its premiere as [...] "the finest evocation of the sea... ever... produced in music", the tone poem, in Dmajor, consists of two subjects, said to represent the playful activity of the nymphs and the majesty of the ocean, respectively. Sibelius gradually develops this material over three informal stages: first, a placid ocean; second, a gathering storm; and third, <b>a</b> <b>thunderous</b> wave-crash climax. As the tempest subsides, a final chord sounds, symbolizing the mighty power and limitless expanse of the sea.|$|E

An energetic, [...] "turbo-charged Broadway chorus number," [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] was written in common time at a [...] "free" [...] tempo of 50 beats per minute, spanning a length of three minutes and forty-four seconds. In [...] "Be Our Guest," [...] Orbach's [...] "low" [...] tenor or baritone vocal range spans roughly three octaves, from the low note of F3 to the high note of D♭6. Described as a [...] "scintillating," [...] "jolly," [...] "lavish and bouncy" [...] song, [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] is, {{according to}} TV Guide, a [...] "boisterous" [...] number, comparing it to songs from the Broadway musicals Hello, Dolly! and Mame.

500|$|After Tosca's [...] "Non la sospiri" [...] and the {{subsequent}} argument inspired by her jealousy, the sensuous character of the love duet [...] "Qual'occhio" [...] provides what opera writer Burton Fisher describes as [...] "an almost erotic lyricism that has been called pornophony". The brief scene in which the sacristan returns with the choristers to celebrate Napoleon's supposed defeat provides almost the last carefree moments in the opera; after the entrance of Scarpia to his menacing theme, the mood becomes sombre, then steadily darker. As the police chief interrogates the sacristan, the [...] "fugitive" [...] motif recurs three more times, each time more emphatically, signalling Scarpia's success in his investigation. In Scarpia's exchanges with Tosca the sound of tolling bells, interwoven with the orchestra, creates an almost religious atmosphere, for which Puccini draws on music from his then unpublished Mass of 1880. The final scene in the act is a juxtaposition of the sacred and the profane, as Scarpia's lustful reverie is sung alongside the swelling Te Deum chorus. He joins with the chorus in the final statement [...] "Te aeternum Patrem omnis terra veneratur" [...] ("Everlasting Father, all the earth worships thee"), before the act ends with <b>a</b> <b>thunderous</b> restatement of the Scarpia motif.|$|E
500|$|A {{diplomatic}} scandal {{between the}} United Kingdom and Malaysia {{broke out in}} 1984, when several British newspapers published pieces on Sultan Iskandar's coronation, citing the headlines such as [...] "Killer becomes King" [...] and [...] "King a Killer", which enraged the Malaysian government, who demanded an apology from the British government. The British government refused to apologise {{on behalf of the}} newspapers, hence triggering tensions between the two countries. Two months later, in June 1984, Sultan Iskandar in his capacity as the Agong, surprised the Malaysian public when he publicly called upon the then-Deputy Prime Minister, Musa Hitam, to make a public apology in front of the entire congregation present at the National Mosque. Sultan Iskandar, on his part, was angry over remarks which Musa made {{during the course of the}} 1983 constitutional crisis that he deemed to be disrespectful. Musa abided to the Agong's demand and boldly came forward to make the apology, which was greeted by <b>a</b> <b>thunderous</b> applause from the entire congregation. The event, which was broadcast live throughout the nation on Malaysian Radio (although the television stations abruptly terminated its broadcast halfway), was seen by many observers as an act of confrontation by the Agong to put Musa in his place.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} universal acclaim from critics.

[...] Denney commented [...] "it frames Kanye’s inner demons in a universal way, recasting Vernon’s semi-mythical woodland retreat {{as his own}} cipher for spiritual replenishment". Los Angeles Times writer Ann Powers called the song an important piece of the album, saying that the sampling of Bon Iver was both surprising and inspired, and noted the differences from [...] "Woods" [...] and [...] "Lost in the World". David Amidon of PopMatters viewed that the track contained [...] "glass-shattering bass", and viewed that the track [...] "storms out of all this dreariness with <b>a</b> <b>thunderous,</b> plodding house bass and Kanye taking Bon Iver in every which direction as the song exudes nothing but triumph." [...] Chris Martins of Spin stated that West managed to transform Iver's [...] "melancholic 'Woods' into a perversely bright experimental dance track." [...] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker commented that the song was difficult to classify as purely a rap song, noting that [...] "West’s music is born of hip-hop, but it now includes so many varieties that it feels most accurate to call it simply Kanye." [...] Jones noted than in less than the six minutes of the song's running time, West [...] "moves from a loner in the woods to his own isolation {{and on to the}} entire African-American experience." ...|$|E
