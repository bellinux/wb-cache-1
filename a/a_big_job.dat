500|$|Adam {{later told}} UK daily {{newspaper}} The Guardian: [...] "No one was allowed in Fort Knox but because [...] Cubby Broccoli {{had some good}} connections and the Kennedys loved Ian Fleming's books I was allowed to fly over it once. It was quite frightening - they had machine guns on the roof. I was also allowed to drive around the perimeter but if you {{got out of the}} car there was a loudspeaker warning you to keep away. There was not a chance of going in it, and I was delighted because I knew from going to the Bank of England vaults that gold isn't stacked very high and it's all underwhelming. It gave me the chance to show the biggest gold repository in the world as I imagined it, with gold going up to heaven. I came up with this cathedral-type design. I had <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>job</b> to persuade Cubby and the director Guy Hamilton at first." ...|$|E
500|$|Bible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, {{who served}} as an aide to the {{executive}} committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: [...] "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held {{a large number of}} votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office." [...] Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, [...] "Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I guess he was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>job</b> on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his memoirs, Dodd {{described}} Mrs. Parker accordingly: [...] "As {{a teacher}} , I {{had taught her}} how to speak; as a legislator, I had gotten her a scholarship that gave her a college education; and as lieutenant governor, I had found her <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>job</b> in our administration. She was a wonderful speaker and a good administrator, but she must have been a born ingrate." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{fell into}} that despondency that lies in {{wait in the}} small hours. He had got too <b>big</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> on--too <b>big</b> <b>a</b> <b>job....</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{imagine you}} are giving me <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>job</b> than you know. If Festing {{has taken the}} {{railroad}} contract, he'll probably stop until he had carried it out. Now I don't imagine I'd find it amusing to loaf about and watch him work; for one thing, it's pretty cold in the ranges after the snow comes." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2005, {{referring}} to her previous efforts at health care reform, she said, [...] "I learned some valuable lessons about the legislative process, the importance of bipartisan cooperation and the wisdom of taking small steps to get <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>job</b> done." [...] Again in 2007, she reflected on her role in 1993–1994: [...] "I think that both {{the process and the}} plan were flawed. We were trying to do something that was very hard to do, and we made a lot of mistakes." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 18, 2006, President George W. Bush {{nominated}} Portman {{to be the}} Director of the Office of Management and Budget, replacing Joshua Bolten, who {{was appointed}} White House Chief of Staff. Portman {{said at the time}} that he looked forward to the responsibility, [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>job.</b> The Office of Management and Budget touches every spending and policy decision in the federal government," [...] while President Bush expressed his confidence in the nominee, [...] "The job of OMB director is a really important post and Rob Portman is the right man to take it on. Rob's talent, expertise and record of success are well known within my administration and on Capitol Hill." [...] He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate unanimously by voice vote on May 26, 2006.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing very much," [...] Gerald replied. [...] "Mental strain, I expect. Managing a bank is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>job</b> and I'm {{not used}} to responsibility." ...|$|E

50|$|SFA {{established}} {{chapters on}} college campuses {{up and down the}} East Coast and held conferences. Among other issues, SFA supported Helms' bid for re-election and organized abortion clinic protests. Reed was temporarily arrested during an abortion protest at the Fleming Center Abortion Clinic in Raleigh but was not charged with any crime. After Reed left SFA for <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>job</b> at the Christian Coalition, SFA faded out of existence by the early 1990s.|$|R

6000|$|... "That's {{where you}} are wrong now. I do wish to see it come to an end. I don't want to see tens of {{thousands}} of men losing their lives because one portion of these States wants to ride rough-shod over the other. The sooner the North looks this affair squarely in the face and sees that it has taken up <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>job</b> than it can carry through, and agrees to let those who wish to leave it go if they like, the better for all parties. That's what I think about it." ...|$|R
50|$|Kohle's sister Bridget checked Hayley's e-mail {{account and}} could see the last message Hayley sent was one to her, {{just days before the}} death, which said she was very excited about good news she'd {{received}} about <b>a</b> <b>big</b> modelling <b>job.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It hits {{me where}} I feel it, and hits me hard. I reckon {{the men who}} fought that old battle meant to make good. I don't know how Miss Halliday knows what a man with red blood feels when he's got to put over <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hard <b>job,</b> but she does know." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “Then, there’s <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>job</b> ahead,” grumbled Bethune; “and my {{experience}} is {{that as soon as}} you drive a chisel into old work you come upon a spike. Unfortunately, we haven’t a grindstone.” ...|$|E

50|$|Constructing a {{new code}} is like {{building}} a new language and writing a dictionary for it; it was <b>an</b> especially <b>big</b> <b>job</b> before computers. If a code is compromised, the entire task must be done all over again, and {{that means a lot}} of work for both cryptographers and the code users. In practice, when codes were in widespread use, they were usually changed on a periodic basis to frustrate codebreakers, and to limit the useful life of stolen or copied codebooks.|$|R
50|$|Forster left ICI in 1966, {{determined}} {{to use her}} experience to read for the Bar and become a patent attorney. To pay her way {{she worked as a}} business consultant, but when she secured <b>a</b> particularly <b>big</b> <b>job</b> in January 1968, she found she had no time to continue her studies and became a full-time consultant. By 1970, being self-employed was becoming impractical so she established Industrial Aids Limited as a consultancy business. The business grew rapidly and allowed her to indulge her hobby of yacht racing.|$|R
6000|$|... "For one thing, they reckon it's theirs. Then {{they have}} money {{enough to get}} to work properly. You have taken up too <b>big</b> <b>a</b> <b>job,</b> and now's your chance to quit. If you're prudent, you won't let it go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That will be <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>job,</b> chief, {{but there}} is no doubt we must lay in a great store of it. Well, there is plenty of timber down in the valley, and with ten horses we can bring up a tidy lot every day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I haven't {{followed}} these Rovers all the {{way from}} Valley Brook farm to here for nothing," [...] went on Henry Bradner.

6000|$|Jonas smiled. [...] "My {{opinion about}} morals to stories {{is that the}} people who read them ought to work them out for themselves," [...] said he. [...] "Some people work out one kind of moral, and others work out another kind. It was <b>a</b> pretty <b>big</b> <b>job</b> to write that story, which I had to do the most of, and I don't think I ought to be called on to put in any moral, which is a good deal like being asked to make bread for the man who buys my wheat." ...|$|R
