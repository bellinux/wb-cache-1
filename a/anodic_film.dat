The positron annihilation lifetime spectra of the anodized aluminium were measured and fitted into three lifetime components.

40|$|Porous anodic alumina {{films with}} self-ordered {{nanopore}} channels {{have been used}} for surfacetreatment of aluminum and its alloys to improve corrosion and wear resistance. The films are also of recentinterest as key materials for nanodevices and as template for fabrication of nanomaterials. Self-orderingelectrochemical anodizing has been recently extended to other metals including titanium, zirconium,niobium, iron and stainless steel, and these nanostructured anodic films have many promising applications. The extensions to many metals and alloys were mainly achieved by finding novel organic electrolytescontaining fluoride and small amounts of water. Although extensive studies on formation mechanism ofporous anodic alumina films formed in aqueous acid electrolytes have been conducted, little is known aboutthe growth mechanism of the anodic films in the organic electrolytes, particularly on iron that is the mostimportant practical metal. Understanding the growth mechanism is of significant importance to control themorphology and composition of the anodic films. Thus, this study focused on elucidating the growthmechanism of the nanostructured anodic films on iron. Further, in this study {{it was found that the}} fluoridecontainingorganic electrolytes with a wide range of water concentrations are suitable for the formation ofcompact, so-called barrier-type anodic films on magnesium, which is also a practically important lightmetal. This dissertation includes six chapters. Chapter 1 describes the general introduction of anodizingand objective of this dissertation. In chapter 2, the preparation of materials and experimental conditionsemployed for this study as well as major characterization techniques were described in detail. Chapter 3 describes the critical factors influencing the film morphology and growth mechanism onthe <b>anodic</b> <b>film</b> on iron. Water concentration in electrolyte influences largely the film structure andcomposition of the <b>anodic</b> <b>film</b> as well as the distribution of fluoride-rich layer within the <b>anodic</b> <b>film.</b> Forinstance, scalloped metal/film interface, typical of porous anodic alumina, was observed only when thewater concentration was ≥ 1. 5 mol dm- 3. At lower water concentrations the interface became flat. A thinnerbarrier layer beneath the porous layer was formed by an increase in water concentration. Carbon andfluoride incorporations were also suppressed at high water concentration. TEM observations clearlydisclosed that fluoride enrichment occurred at the cell boundaries as well as at the scalloped metal/filminterface when the water concentration was 1. 5 ml dm- 3. The preferential dissolution of fluoride-rich cellboundaries caused the development of self-ordered nanotubular anodic films at high water concentrations. In contrast, no fluoride enrichment was found at cell boundaries when the water concentration was low (0. 1 mol dm- 3). Thus, no nanotubular film was formed at low water concentrations. Through the findings in thischapter, a transition of the growth mechanism from “field-assisted dissolution” to “field-assisted flow” withwater concentration was proposed. In Chapter 4, a barrier-type <b>anodic</b> <b>film</b> was formed on magnetron-sputtered iron by employingpotentiodynamic anodizing at a relatively fast sweep rate, and the influence of electric field on thedissolution of the barrier-type <b>anodic</b> <b>film</b> was examined. It was found from Rutherford backscatteringspectroscopy that the barrier-type <b>anodic</b> <b>film</b> formed in ethylene glycol electrolyte containing 0. 1 mol dm- 3 NH 4 F and 0. 1 mol dm- 3 water consists of two layers, comprising an outer iron hydroxy-fluoride layer andan inner iron fluoride layer, with the latter layer forming as a consequence of the faster migration of fluorideions in comparison with oxygen species. The barrier layer was formed even at a current efficiency as lowas 49 %. The application of electric field to the barrier-type film on iron accelerated the chemical dissolutionof the <b>anodic</b> <b>film</b> at the film/electrolyte interface. Below the critical field of approximately 2. 8 MeV cm- 1,uniform thinning of the <b>anodic</b> <b>film</b> occurred due to field-assisted dissolution, while a nanoporous film wasdeveloped above the critical field. The critical field for <b>anodic</b> <b>film</b> on iron is much lower than that recentlyexamined on aluminum (~ 5. 5 MeV cm- 1). In chapter 5, the uniform growth of barrier-type <b>anodic</b> <b>film</b> on magnetron-sputtered magnesiumwas examined in fluoride and phosphate-containing ethylene glycol-H 2 O mixed and aqueous electrolytes. The addition of phosphate to fluoride-containing organic electrolytes induced amorphization of anodic filmand increases the volume expansion factor. The anodic films consisted of phosphate-incorporatedoxyfluoride and the concentration of incorporated phosphate decreased gradually with an increase in waterconcentration. The anodic films consist of two layers with an inner layer containing less amount ofphosphate. The outer layer is formed at the film/electrolyte interface by the migration of Mg 2 + ionsoutwards, while the inner layer is formed at the metal/film interface. The efficiency of film growth reducedfrom 100 % at 0. 1 mol dm- 3 H 2 O to ∼ 52 % in aqueous electrolyte. Despite the low efficiency in aqueouselectrolyte, a barrier-type <b>anodic</b> <b>film</b> with a uniform thickness was developed. The reason for the formationof the barrier-type <b>anodic</b> <b>film,</b> not the porous-type film, at such low efficiency was discussed.

The structures were extensively studied and characterized by EPMA coupled with FEG-SEM and FEG-TEM coupled with EDX at meso and nanoscopic scales, in other words, at {{the scale of}} a single basic cell making up the highly ordered porous <b>anodic</b> <b>film.</b> The analyses allowed {{the identification of the}} chemical compounds present and the evaluation of their levels in the different parts of each cell. Of note was the absence of phosphates inside the “skeleton” and their high content in the “internal part”. Various models of porous <b>anodic</b> <b>film</b> growth are discussed {{on the basis of the}} results, contributing to a better understanding of AAO template preparation and selfnanostructuring phenomena...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA model <b>anodic</b> <b>film</b> was {{prepared}} to incorporate PolyTetraFluoroEthylene (PTFE) nanoparticles into the porous structure of the film. Firstly, {{the influence of the}} anodization parameters on the morphology (thickness and pore diameter) was studied, using notably FEG scanning electronic microscopy. Then, using an improved sedimentation technique, the nanoparticles were successfully inserted into the porous structure and onto its surface. EDX and Raman spectroscopy attested the presence of PTFE particles {{down to the bottom of}} the pores. Secondly, the study demonstrated the benefit of incorporating the PTFE particles. Tribological tests were also carried out and the lubricating properties of the composite analyzed. Friction coefficient curves showed a 75 fold improvement of the total lifetime of the <b>anodic</b> <b>film</b> with a reduced friction coefficient...|$|E
40|$|Anodizing of sputtering-deposited {{magnesium}} and Mg- 0. 75 at. %Cu and Mg- 1. 23 at. %W alloys {{has been}} carried out in a fluoride/ glycerol electrolyte. The aims of the study were to investigate the enrichment of alloying elements in the alloy immediately beneath the <b>anodic</b> <b>film</b> and the migration of alloying element species in the film. The specimens were examined by electron microscopy and ion beam analysis. An enrichment of copper is revealed in the Mg-Cu alloy that increases with the anodizing time up to ∼ 6 × 10 15 Cu atoms cm - 2. Copper species are then incorporated into the <b>anodic</b> <b>film</b> and migrate outwards. In contrast, no enrichment of tungsten occurs in the Mg-W alloy, and tungsten species are immobile in the film...|$|E
40|$|Niobium {{has been}} {{anodized}} {{at a constant}} current density to 10 V with a current decay in 0. 8 mol dm- 3 K 2 HPO 4 -glycerol electrolyte containing 0. 08 to 0. 65 mass% water at 433 K to develop porous <b>anodic</b> oxide <b>films.</b> The film growth rate is markedly increased when the water content is reduced to 0. 08 mass%; a 28 μm-thick porous film is developed in this electrolyte by anodizing for 3. 6 ks, while the thickness is 4. 6 and 2. 6 μm in the electrolytes containing 0. 16 and 0. 65 mass% water respectively. For all the electrolytes, the film thickness changes approximately linearly with the charge passed during anodizing, indicating that chemical dissolution of the developing oxide is negligible. SIMS depth profiling analysis was carried for <b>anodic</b> <b>films</b> formed in electrolyte containing ~ 0. 4 mass% water with and without enrichment of H 218 O. Findings disclose that water in the electrolyte is a predominant source of oxygen in the <b>anodic</b> oxide <b>films.</b> The <b>anodic</b> <b>films</b> formed in the electrolyte containing 0. 65 mass% water are practically free from phosphorus species. Reduction in water content increased the incorporation of phosphorus species...|$|R
40|$|Microstructures such as microchannels and microchambers were {{fabricated}} on <b>anodic</b> oxide <b>film</b> {{of aluminium}} with laser direct patterning technique. The aluminium substrate covered with porous type <b>anodic</b> oxide <b>film</b> was dyed with organic dyes followed by hydrothermal treatment. The coloured and pore sealed film shows much higher absorption then as-formed porous film, that makes possible to pattern {{various types of}} microstructures on the film by removing {{the upper part of}} the film surface by laser irradiation. Structure of the crystallized hydroxide layer on the surface of the <b>anodic</b> oxide <b>film,</b> formed during pore sealing, as well as the partial removal of <b>anodic</b> oxide <b>film</b> from the surface is described. Microstructures with depth lower than 1 – 27 μm were patterned successfully on 16 and 32 μm thick <b>anodic</b> oxide <b>film</b> surfaces, using various combinations of laser power and laser scanning speed. The affect of the laser scanning speed and laser power density on the shape of the microstructures is also explained...|$|R
