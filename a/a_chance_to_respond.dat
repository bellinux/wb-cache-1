The region's Protestant mission established the United Mission of Copperbelt (UMCB), which led to the establishment of Protestant bodies such as the Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia (CCAR) in 1945 and the United Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia in 1958 (which became the United Church of Zambia in 1965).|$|E
25|$|Months {{after the}} {{preliminary}} version of VIGOR {{was published in}} the New England Journal of Medicine, the journal editors learned that certain data reported to the FDA {{were not included in the}} NEJM article. Several years later, when they were shown a Merck memo during the depositions for the first federal Vioxx trial, they realized that these data had been available to the authors months before publication. The editors wrote an editorial accusing the authors of deliberately withholding the data.

He had earlier denied any relationship between the timing of the editorial and the trial. Although his testimony was not actually used in the December trial, Curfman had testified well before the publication of the editorial.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike most game shows, {{there is}} no minimum age {{necessary}} to participate in [...] "Family Feud." [...] Each round begins with a [...] "face-off" [...] question {{that serves as a}} toss-up between two opposing contestants. The host asks a survey question that was previously posed to a group of 100 people (e.g., [...] "Name the hour that you get up on Sunday mornings."). A certain number of answers are concealed on the board, ranked by popularity of the survey's responses. Only answers that receive two or more responses can appear on the board. The first contestant to buzz-in gives an answer; if it is the most popular, his/her family immediately wins the face-off. Otherwise, the opponent responds and the family member providing the higher-ranked answer wins. Ties are broken in favor of the contestant who buzzes-in first. If neither contestant's answer is on the board, the other eight contestants have <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond,</b> one at a time from alternating sides, until an answer is revealed.

40|$|Apoptosis is {{a genetically}} {{regulated}} biological process that {{plays a major}} role in chemotherapy-induced tumor cell killing. It may be triggered by two major intracellular signaling cascades, the mitochondrial pathway and the death receptor pathway, both leading to caspase activation and cleavage of specific cellular substrates. The p 53 gene is involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Caspase activation following wild-type p 53 induction is associated with the release of the apoptogenic factors cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from the mitochondria, that is in turn controlled by the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl- 2 family proteins. In ovarian cancer p 53 status is a strong predictor of response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients whose tumors have p 53 mutations experience <b>a</b> lower <b>chance</b> of achieving <b>a</b> complete response following platinum-based regimens when compared to patients without p 53 mutations. Conversely, experimental and clinical data seem to show that paclitaxel enhances apoptosis through a p 53 -independent pathway, that probably involves the Bax gene. Whereas patients with wild-type p 53 tumors have <b>a</b> good <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> platinum, patients with mutant p 53 tumors may have a clinical benefit from the addition of paclitaxel to platinum-based chemotherapy. Therefore determining p 53 status can be useful in predicting therapeutic response to specific drugs. Moreover the understanding of cellular mechanisms regulating apoptosis might offer a strong rationale for the combination of chemotherapy with other biological treatments...|$|R
40|$|Background: Patients coinfected with HBV, HDV, HCV and HIV {{are usually}} {{excluded}} from clinical trials. Data on pegylated interferon treatment {{in this setting}} are limited, with predictive factors for HDV virologic success being unknown. Objectives: In this study we analyzed {{the time course of}} HDV viral load and HBsAg in HBV-HDV-HCV-HIV patients, who underwent pegylated alfa- 2 a interferon (peg-IFN) therapy for HDV infection between 2005 and 2009, with different virologic outcomes (no response, relapse or sustained response). Methods: Three patients were selected for virologic analysis, since complete clinical and laboratory data and stored residual blood samples, collected before/during/after peg-IFN treatment were available. Plasma samples were retrospectively analyzed for HDV-RNA detection and quantitative HBsAg determination. Results: All patients were HCV-Ab positive, persistently HCV-RNA negative, and received a peg-IFN treatment curse (180 mcg/week) for 12 to 18 months. HIV and HBV viral loads remained undetectable due to underlying Tenofovir/Emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) treatment. Low baseline HDV-RNA and HBsAg levels were both observed in the patient with sustained viral response. A HDV-RNA decline greater than 2 log 10 at month 6 was observed in two of the three patients, both with compensated liver cirrhosis, achieving a viral clearance at the end of treatment. Conclusions: Although performed in few patients, this study suggests that a decline of HDV-RNA during treatment and low baseline quantitative HBsAg may be associated to HDV virologic response to peg-IFN in HIV-infected subjects, independently of fibrosis stage. If confirmed on larger patient number, these data may help to select those HDV-infected patients with <b>a</b> reliable <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> prolonged peg-IFN treatment and suggest the importance of quantitative HBsAg monitoring in this setting...|$|R
40|$|Administrative law is {{animated}} by two complementary purposes: first, to protect participatory rights in public decision-making, and second, to ensure accountability for public decision-making. The Anti-Terrorism Bill, with its sweeping and vague goals related to combatting terrorism, raises important and complex {{questions regarding the}} scope of participatory rights and accountability in the national security decision-making context. This chapter explores {{the way in which}} the Anti-Terrorist Bill intersects with each of these purposes. Using the Charity Registration (Security Information) Act as a case study, Sossin demonstrates that procedural guarantees can and will be sacrificed in contexts of national security. Ministerial certificates indicating that a person or group is engaged in terrorist activities, may be based on secret evidence, and may be signed and applied in circumstances where the affected parties never have <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> know or <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the allegations made against them. While limited review is provided for some of these extraordinary ministerial powers (for example, Ministerial certificates are referred to Federal Court Judges to determine whether the Minister had a reasonable basis for signing them), Courts are likely to defer to the judgment of executive decision-makers exercising broad discretion in the context of national security. While the jurisprudence of administrative suggests both participatory rights and accountability measures may be sacrificed to promote national security, Sossin argues that they should not be so lightly set aside. Both procedural fairness and meaningful forms of public review lead to more accurate, more just and more legitimate decision-making, which in turn may well result in enhancing both national security and respect for the rule of law...|$|R

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the future of Africa lies in the {{development}} of its rural areas. Indeed, there is no need to stress that freedom without supportive economic strength, is like a house without walls. And it is high time that Africa seriously concentrated on building the walls to protect its freedom The establishment of CIRDAFRICA (Centre on Integrated Rural Development for Africa) was agreed upon at the 10 th Regional Conference of the FAO for Africa and the agreement was adopted by 34 African countries who attended the 1976 Government Consultation Meeting in Arusha, Tanzania where the Centre's headquarters were opened in 1982. The need for an integrated approach to development was also explicitly stated in the OAU Lagos Plan of Action. Apart from CIRDAFRICA there are three similar centres designed to cover other Third World countries: CIRDAP in Bangladesh for Asia and the Pacific; and those being established in Jordan and Saint Dominica for the Near East and Latin America, respectively. The main purpose in establishing CIRDAFRICA was to bring African countries closer together for more effective discussion of common development problems. This will hopefully lead to joint action at both the regional and continental level designed to enhance opportunities for a real confrontation with the issues of development in rural areas. CIRDAFRICA is thus not meant to impose a development plan on any country nor to intervene in ongoing development programmes. Its role is that of a catalyst: to identfy the specific strategies needed to enhance and speed up the success of national programmes. In this regard, its charter provides for the establishment of a network of National Integrated Rural Development Centres (NlRDCs), through which it operates within each national boundary. Considering the pan-African nature of its activities and the diversity of the environment in which it is operating, the Centre effectively plays an advisory and supportive role on research, training and planning of programmes and emphasizes that national programmes should be drawn upon the lines suggested by the Lagos Plan nf Action To promote and facilitate the implementation of national IRD programmes CIRDAFRICA provides many opportunities for the exchange of information and experience between member states by bringing together planners and other people involved in rural development programmes. This is done by organizing conferences, workshops and seminars at both the regional and sub-regional level as well as through CIRDAFRICA publications As a mechanism by which African countries can exchange experiences among themselves or with developing countries in other regions, CIRDAFRICA provides a way for countries to learn from one another and <b>a</b> unique <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> both opportunity and obligation CIRDAFRICA P.

40|$|Introduction: Regeneration oft the HPA-system is {{considered}} as a prerequisite for appropriate response to antidepressants. The FKBP 5 -gene regulates {{the function of the}} HPA-system by modulating the sensitivity of the GR. Previous studies demonstrated that polymorphisms in this gene are associated with response to different classes of antidepressants. This association has most consistently been shown for the single nucleotide polymorphism rs 1360780 in two previous studies. The present study firstly aimed to replicate these findings in a sample of unipolar depressed inpatients during an entire complex treatment process. The patients were randomized to either standardized algorithm-guided treatment or naturalistic treatment. The second objective {{of the study was to}} analyse if the FKBP 5 -genotype exerts an influence on the effect of an algorithm- guided pharmacotherapy. This would mean that the effect of the algorithm is disproportionately high for a specific genotype and that this genotype might benefit notably from standardization of treatment. Methods: For objective 1 we analysed the association of genotype and response respectively remission in the total sample of 298 patients for two different treatment periods which were oriented towards the algorithm: The first period lasted up to 6 weeks (antidepressant monotherapy in the algorithm), the second up to 14 weeks of treatment (complete treatment process including pharmacological augmentation strategies). The sample was composed of 171 algorithm-treated and 127 naturalistically treated patients. For objective 2 we analysed for statistical interactions between genotype and treatment mode (standardized vs. naturalistic). Main statistical method was Cox-regression analysis. Response was defined as a 50 % reduction of HAMD- 21 and remission was achieved with a HAMD-score < 10. Results: In accordance with previous studies we found a significant association of the FKBP 5 -genotype with treatment outcome. T/T-carriers showed <b>a</b> higher <b>chance</b> of <b>responding</b> compared <b>to</b> C-allele carriers. The difference was significant for the first observation period (HR = 1, 77; p = 0, 032) with an even stronger level of significance for the entire observation period of up to 14 weeks (HR = 1, 92; p = 0, 008). The results for remission were similar. Regarding the second objective of the study we detected a significantly superior effect of the algorithm-guided treatment in C-allele carriers, whereas the treatment mode did not influence treatment outcome in T/T-carriers. Conclusion: Our findings replicate the association of FKBP 5 genotype with response to antidepressant treatment and show the association even for a complex treatment process. Homozygous carriers of the T-allele showed <b>a</b> significantly higher <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> independently of the treatment mode. The results suggest that especially C- allele carriers benefit from a highly standardized treatment and thus their “genetic disadvantage” concerning treatment response can partially be compensated...|$|R
