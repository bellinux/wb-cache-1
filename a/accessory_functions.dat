Viability was approximately 90 % 0 - 72 h after exposure of ADH to 5 mJ/cm 2 of UV-B. Interleukin 1 (IL- 1) activity of supernatants of ADH was assayed on C 3 H/HeJ mouse thymocytes. Pretreatment of ADH with 5 mJ/cm 2 UV-B decreased lipopolysaccharide-stimulated IL- 1 activity from 169 +/- 34 (mean U/ml +/- s. e.) to 4 +/- 1 (P less than 0. 01, n = 4). Lysates of UV-B irradiated.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of human peripheral blood (PB) dendritic cells (DC) and monocytes to facilitate T cell activation {{and the interaction}} molecules employed were compared. We have shown that precursors of DC constitute 2 to 3 % of circulating PBMC, and can be isolated as CD 33 +CD 14 dim cells, whereas monocytes are CD 33 +CD 14 bright. Freshly obtained DC expressed similar densities of HLA-DR and the accessory molecules LFA- 3, ICAM- 1, and B 7 as monocytes; after a 36 -h incubation the expression of HLA-DR, ICAM- 1, and B 7 increased on both APC. <b>Accessory</b> cell <b>function</b> was examined in PB T cell cultures stimulated by suboptimal concentrations of immobilized mAb to CD 3, and by stimulation of an allospecific T cell line. Freshly isolated monocytes and DC were comparable accessory cells in these assays, but their <b>accessory</b> <b>function</b> was increased by in vitro preincubation, although cultured DC and monocytes were comparably active. In contract, DC were much more effective stimulators of freshly isolated allogeneic T cells than monocytes. DC were much more effective stimulators of freshly isolated allogeneic PB CD 4 + naive and memory T cells than monocytes, whereas DC and monocytes were comparable accessory cells for memory and naive T cells stimulated with immobilized anti-CD 3.

We do not know, however, how well plasmids that do not encode <b>accessory</b> <b>functions</b> can survive in nature. The goal {{of this study was}} to characterize the backbone and accessory gene content of plasmids that were captured from freshwater sources without selecting for a particular phenotype or cultivating their host. To do this, triparental matings were used such that the only required phenotype was the plasmid's ability to mobilize a nonconjugative plasmid. Based on complete genome sequences of 10 plasmids, only 5 carried identifiable accessory gene regions, and none carried antibiotic resistance genes. The plasmids belong to four known incompatibility groups (IncN, IncP- 1, IncU, and IncW) and two potentially new groups. Eight of the plasmids were shown to have a broad host range, being able to transfer into alpha-, beta-, and gammaproteobacteria. Because of the absence of antibiotic resistance genes, we resampled one of the sites and compared the proportion of captured plasmids that conferred antibiotic resistance to their hosts with the proportion of such plasmids captured from the effluent of a local wastewater treatment plant. Few of the captured plasmids from either site encoded antibiotic resistance.

In contrast, depletion of HLA-DR+ cells {{had no effect}} on NK activity against K 562 target cells. When HLA-DR-depleted cells were added to Leu- 11 b-depleted cells, NK activity against CMV-FS 4 was restored. Negative selection experiments indicated that the HLA-DR+ cells contributing to NK activity against CMV-FS 4 are not B or T cells, while negative and positive selection experiments excluded a role for monocytes. Experiments in which HLA-DR- and Leu- 11 b- cells were mixed in varying proportions indicated that NK(CMV-FS 4) is mediated by Leu- 11 b+ cells, while HLA-DR+ cells provide an <b>accessory</b> <b>function.</b> Irradiation (50 GY) abolished the NK effector function of Leu- 11 b+ cells, but not the <b>accessory</b> <b>function</b> of HLA-DR+ cells.

The ability of these supernatants to restore NK activity of HLA-DR- cells was completely abrogated by the addition of neutralizing amounts of antibody to IFN-alpha.

A unified description and the new tabular algorithm of various arithmetic operations run between the various types of fuzzy sets are proposed and tabular methods of reliability analysis of the basic structures of fuzzy systems are developed. Originality. A generalized description of triangular and trapezoid-shaped <b>accessory</b> <b>functions</b> of fuzzy boundaries in a special tuples is introduced, analytical expressions for the formation of tabular schedules of their functions and the calculation of the reliability of fuzzy systems with complex structures are obtained: sequential, redundant - parallel, serial-parallel, parallel-serial. The practical value. The obtained models and tabular algorithms simplify the calculations of the reliability of complex electro-mechanical human-machine automation systems with fuzzy parameters and vague boundaries...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} T-cells, B-cells, {{and natural}} killer cells of four normal individuals for surface-bound fibronectin (FN) using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and double fluorescence labeling with monoclonal antibodies. While Leu 12 (CD 19) -positive B-cells stained also uniformly with anti-FN antibody, neither OKT 3 (CD 3) -positive T-cells nor Leu 11 (CD 16) -positive {{natural killer cells}} could be labeled with anti-FN. Although an anti-FN receptor antibody was not available, these data strongly suggest a distinct pattern of FN-binding by human lymphocytes. Key words: fibronectin, B-lymphocytes, FACS Previous studies indicate that monocytes [1], granulocytes [2], and platelets [3] have membrane receptors for fibronectin (FN). Although the significance of surface bound FN {{has not yet been}} clearly defined, it is hypothesized that FN on the surface of granulocytes and monocytes participates in nonspecific host resistance through regulation of mononuclear phagocytic cell function [4, 5]. Preliminary data also suggest that FN is involved in the <b>accessory</b> <b>function</b> of canine dendritic cells and monocytes (unpublished observation). Since certain lymphocyte subpopulations can also exert <b>accessory</b> <b>function,</b> we investigated whether lymphocytes of B and T lineage and natural killer cells also express FN on their surface. Heparinized peripheral blood was obtained from four healthy donors (two males and two females, 21 - 46 years of age). Mononuclear cells were isolated using Ficoll-Hypaque gradients (LSM-Bionetics) [6]. T-cell (E) and non-T-cell (E) subpopulalions were prepared by mixing washed peripheral blood lymphocytes with 2 -amino...|$|R
40|$|The surface {{expression}} of class II {{major histocompatibility complex}} immune-associated (Ia) antigen is a principal <b>accessory</b> <b>function</b> of macrophages for antigen-specific T-cell activation and immunoregulation. To explore the mechanisms of impaired cell-mediated immunity in invasive amebiasis, we investigated the effects of Entamoeba histolytica proteins on gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) -induced Ia expression by murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. Pretreatment of macrophages with secreted (conditioned medium) or whole soluble amebic proteins inhibited the induction of IFN-gamma-induced surface Ia antigen expression by 30 to 61 % but {{had no effect on}} surface Ia molecules already expressed. By Northern (RNA) blot analysis, amebic proteins suppressed IFN-gamma-induced macrophage I-A beta mRNA accumulation by 36 % but did not alter the constitutive levels of actin mRNA expression. E. histolytica stimulated macrophages to produce high levels of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) as determined by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and quantification by PGE 2 -specific radioimmunoassay. Inhibition of PGE 2 biosynthesis with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin abrogated ameba-induced suppression of Ia antigen by 60 %, whereas exogenously added PGE 2 decreased IFN-gamma-induced macrophage Ia expression by 44 %. Our results suggest that the mechanism whereby E. histolytica suppresses IFN-gamma-induced macrophage surface Ia molecule synthesis and I-A beta mRNA expression is by stimulating the production of PGE 2, which acts in an autocrine fashion for immunoregulation. E. histolytica subverting critical macrophage <b>accessory</b> <b>function</b> via PGE 2 biosynthesis is a novel strategy which the parasite uses to suppress host defenses...|$|R
40|$|The {{activation}} mechanism of resident peritoneal macrophages by in vivo g-irradiation was investi-gated. The function of macrophages as accessory cells in concanavalin A-induced proliferation of spleno-lymphocytes (<b>accessory</b> <b>function)</b> was enhanced 4 h after a low-dose irradiation (4 cGy) in vivo, {{but not in}} vitro, indicating that low-dose irradiation acts indirectly on the activation of macrophages. Because we expected that macrophages were activated by the recognition of substances damaged by in vivo irradiation, we co-cultured macrophages with oxidized erythrocyte-ghosts. No change was found in their <b>accessory</b> <b>function.</b> The production of inflammatory cytokines, interleukin- 1 b (IL- 1 b) and inter-feron-g (IFN-g), in the supernatant of cocultures of spleno-lymphocytes and macrophages was deter-mined by an ELISA. Production of both increased {{in the presence of}} in vivo irradiated macrophages. Furthermore, IL- 1 b production from in vivo-irradiated macrophages treated with recombinant IFN-g also was enhanced. The mRNA expression of the cytokines released from macrophages and lymphocytes was determined by RT-PCR. Increases in IL- 1 b mRNA expression were found in both in vivo- and in vitro-irradiated macrophages. In vivo irradiation also enhanced the expression of IFN-g mRNA in lympho-cytes, whereas there was no change after in vitro irradiation. On the basis of these observations, we propose that the activation of macrophages is caused by interaction with neighboring cells, such as lymphocytes, and by paracrine induction of certain cytokines which is initiated by the small amount of IL- 1 b released by irradiated macrophages...|$|R
