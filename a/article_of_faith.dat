25|$|The {{veracity}} of the apparitions of Lourdes {{is not an}} <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> for Catholics. Nevertheless, all recent Popes visited the Marian shrine at some time. Benedict XV, Pius XI, and John XXIII went there as bishops, Pius XII as papal delegate. He also issued an encyclical, Le pèlerinage de Lourdes, on the one-hundredth anniversary of the apparitions in 1958. John Paul II visited Lourdes three times during his Pontificate, and twice before as a Bishop.|$|E
25|$|The Calendar for May by Pseudo-Jacquemart. (fol.3r) is {{an example}} of {{iconography}} first used by Jean Pucelle in the Belleville Breviary. Each month of the year shows an apostle, representative of the New Testament, and a prophet of the Old Testament. The prophet submits a veiled prophecy which is explained by the apostle as an <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith,</b> while simultaneously, the prophet gives the apostle a stone from the synagogue, which as the months progress is reduced to a ruin.|$|E
25|$|Liberal {{branches}} of Judaism make some additional {{changes to the}} opening benedictions. the phrase umeivi go'eil ("and brings a redeemer") is changed in Reform Judaism to umeivi ge'ulah ("who brings redemption"), replacing the personal messiah with a Messianic Age. The phrase m'chayei hameitim ("who causes the dead to come to life") is replaced in the Reform and Reconstructionist siddurim with m'chayei hakol ("who gives life to all") and m'chayei kol chai ("who gives life to all life"), respectively. This represents a {{turn away from the}} traditional <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> that God will resurrect the dead.|$|E

25|$|However, the First Cause {{does not}} {{necessarily}} have to be temporally the first. Thus, {{the question of whether}} or not the universe can be imagined as eternal was fiercely debated in the Middle Ages. The University of Paris's condemnation of 1270 denounced the belief that the world is eternal. Aquinas' intellectual rival, Bonaventure, held that the temporality of the universe is demonstrable by reason. Aquinas' position was that the temporality of the world is an <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith,</b> and not demonstrable by reason; though one could reasonably conclude either that the universe is temporal or eternal.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between the Sikhs and the Mughals further deteriorated following {{the execution of the}} ninth Guru Tegh Bahadur by Aurengzeb, who was highly intolerant of Sikhs, partially driven by his desire to impose Islamic law. Following the executions of their leaders and facing increasing persecution, the Sikhs officially adopted militarization for self-protection by creating the Khalsa; the executions also prompted formalization of various aspects of the Sikh faith. The tenth and final guru, Guru Gobind Singh formally included the kirpan as a mandatory <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> for all baptised Sikhs, making it a duty for Sikhs to be able to defend themselves and others from oppression.|$|E
25|$|According to the Ahmadi Muslim view, {{the fourth}} <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> in Islam is {{concerned}} with the belief in all divine prophets sent by God. Ahmadi Muslims believe that when the world is filled with unrighteousness and immorality, or when a specific part of the world displays these attributes, or when the followers of a certain law (religion) become corrupt or incorporate corrupted teachings into the faith, thus making the faith obsolete or in need of a Divine Sustainer, then a Prophet of God is sent to re-establish His Divine Will. Aside from the belief in all prophets in the Quran and the Old Testament, the Community also regards Zoroaster, Krishna, Buddha, Confucius as prophets.|$|E

25|$|The fifth <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> {{relates to}} the Day of Judgment. According to the Ahmadis, after belief in one God, belief in the Day of Judgement is the most {{emphasized}} doctrine mentioned in the Quran. According to Ahmadi Muslim beliefs, the entire universe will {{come to an end}} on the Day of Judgment, a position also taken by all other Islamic sects and schools of thought. The dead will be resurrected and accounts will be taken of their deeds. People with good records will enter into Heaven while those with bad records will be thrown into Hell. Hell is understood in Ahmadiyya as a temporary abode, lasting an extremely long time but not everlasting, much like in mainstream Judaism. It is thought to be like a hospital, where souls are cleansed of their sins, and this view is based on the Quran and Hadith.|$|E
25|$|One {{of these}} movements, Mahdism, {{was founded in}} the late nineteenth century. It has been likened to a {{religious}} order, {{but it is not a}} tariqa in the traditional sense. Mahdism and its adherents, the Ansar, sought the regeneration of Islam, and in general were critical of the turuq. Muhammad Ahmad ibn as Sayyid Abd Allah, a faqih, proclaimed himself to be al-Mahdi al-Muntazar ("the awaited guide in the right path"), the messenger of God and representative of the Prophet Muhammad, an assertion that became an <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> among the Ansar. He was sent, he said, to prepare the way for the second coming of the Prophet Isa (Jesus) and the impending end of the world. In anticipation of Judgment Day, it was essential that the people return to a simple and rigorous, even puritanical Islam (see Mahdiyah). The idea of the coming of a Mahdi has roots in Sunni Islamic traditions. The issue for Sudanese and other Muslims was whether Muhammad Ahmad was in fact the Mahdi.|$|E

Author Simon Leng refers to the album as a [...] "forgotten blockbuster", representing [...] "the close of an age, the last offering of the Beatles' London era". EMI reissued the album in 2006, in remastered form with bonus tracks, and released a deluxe-edition CD/DVD set that included film clips of four songs.|$|E
500|$|The Ten Wings were {{traditionally}} {{attributed to}} Confucius, possibly {{based on a}} misreading of the Records of the Grand Historian.

500|$|Harrison {{would not}} again release an album {{that matched the}} {{critical}} and commercial achievements of All Things Must Pass; however, his next solo album, 1973's Living in the Material World, held the number one spot on the Billboard album chart for five weeks, and the album's single, [...] "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)", also reached {{number one in the}} US. In the UK, the LP achieved number two, spending 12 weeks on the charts with the single peaking at number 8. The album was lavishly produced and packaged, and its dominant message was Harrison's Hindu beliefs. In Greene's opinion it [...] "contained many of the strongest compositions of his career". Stephen Holden, writing in Rolling Stone, felt the album was [...] "vastly appealing" [...] and [...] "profoundly seductive", and that it stood [...] "alone as an <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith,</b> miraculous in its radiance". Other reviewers were less enthusiastic, describing the release as awkward, sanctimonious and overly sentimental, a reaction that left Harrison despondent.|$|E
500|$|George Harrison's 1973 album Living in the Material World had divided music critics, with Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone lauding it as [...] "a pop {{religious}} {{ceremony for}} all seasons" [...] and [...] "an <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith,</b> miraculous in its radiance", while the NMEs reviewer derided the pious {{nature of the}} songs and concluded: [...] "So damn holy I could scream." [...] Although the album was another [...] "massive" [...] commercial success for Harrison, and the general perception remained {{that he was still}} the most capable of the four ex-Beatles, Harrison was reportedly stung by this criticism of the overt Vaishnava Hindu spirituality in his music. His purchase of Bhaktivedanta Manor early that year as a UK headquarters for ISKCON – or, colloquially, [...] "the Hare Krishna movement" [...] – led to ridicule in the British press. Author Joshua Greene, a former ISKCON devotee, describes a visit Harrison made to the house in August 1973 when the singer shared his concerns with Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the movement's international leader: [...] "I'm provoking a bad reaction," [...] Harrison confided.
