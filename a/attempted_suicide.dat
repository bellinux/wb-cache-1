5|$|In Singapore, <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide,</b> abetment of suicide, and abetment of <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide</b> are {{criminal}} acts. This {{applies to}} physicians who aid patients in ending their lives. Such physicians {{are unable to}} claim a defence under section 88 of the Penal Code since they intended to cause the patients' deaths. However, physicians are absolved of liability if patients refuse treatment for terminal illnesses by issuing advance medical directives.|$|E

40|$|Some {{patients}} who <b>attempt</b> <b>suicide</b> refuse treatment. These patients are invariably treated if brought to hospital. There {{are several reasons}} for this. These reasons justify the treatment {{of many of these}} patients, but not all. Some {{patients who}} <b>attempt</b> <b>suicide</b> ought to be allowed to die. My argument for this claim turns on judging some patients who <b>attempt</b> <b>suicide</b> to be sufficiently competent and rational be allowed to die...|$|R
50|$|Previous <b>attempts</b> of <b>suicide</b> {{also play}} a major role in a youth <b>attempting</b> <b>suicide</b> again. On average, it has been {{recorded}} that the follow-up period for suicide-attempters was 3.88 years. Evidence shows that the primary suspects for suicide are those who failed in their original <b>attempts</b> at <b>suicide,</b> with research claiming that those previously <b>attempting</b> <b>suicide</b> can have anywhere from a 40 to over a 100 times higher chance of committing suicide compared to that of the general population.|$|R

50|$|Research on suicide {{can be a}} {{difficult}} process because suicidal patients are commonly covert about their intentions to avoid hospitalization. An implicit cognition associated self-task was applied in one experiment to unveil any suspicious behavior of people who might <b>attempt</b> <b>suicide.</b> This study found patients who were released from mental hospitals showed significant implicit association to <b>attempt</b> <b>suicide.</b> The Implicit Association Task would predict whether a patient was likely to <b>attempt</b> <b>suicide</b> depending on they respond. An individual's implicit cognition {{may lead to a}} behavior to best cope with stress. This behavior may be suicide, substance abuse, or even violence. However, implicit association with death will show those most at risk for <b>attempting</b> <b>suicide</b> because this individual is looking for the best solution for ending their stress.|$|R

It was found to be generally superior to dicoumarol, and in 1954 was approved for medical use in humans. An early recipient of warfarin was US president Dwight Eisenhower, who was prescribed the drug after having a heart attack in 1955.|$|E

5|$|Braun herself <b>attempted</b> <b>suicide</b> on 10 or 11 August 1932 by {{shooting}} {{herself in the}} chest with her father's pistol. Historians feel the attempt was not serious, but was a bid for Hitler's attention. After Braun's recovery, Hitler became more committed to her {{and by the end}} of 1932 they had become lovers. She often stayed overnight at his Munich apartment when he was in town. Beginning in 1933, Braun worked as a photographer for Hoffmann. This position enabled her to travel—accompanied by Hoffmann—with Hitler's entourage as a photographer for the Nazi Party. Later in her career she worked for Hoffman's art press.|$|E
