40|$|This article {{addresses}} Russia's barter economy. Using interview data, it {{examines the}} mechanics of barter settlements and classifies the main types of non-monetary transactions. The major reason for barter is lack of a competitive monetary system. In the 1990 s barter represented a specific vehicle to perform settlements. Barter itself is not a way to evade taxes or to defraud enterprises of assets. But barter changed the motivation of enterprises and led to systematic distortion of accounting data. The low transparency of the barter economy creates barriers for investment and restructuring. The barter economy is an insider's economy. The lack of <b>affiliated</b> <b>entity</b> regulation and mechanisms for disclosure of transactions with related parties stimulates insiders to criminal application of barter and monetary surrogates. Barter has become a profitable business {{for a number of}} important economic agents including financial intermediaries affiliated with top managers of the biggest privatised enterprises and government agencies. ...|$|E

40|$|To {{approach}} {{the implementation of}} the Green Intellectual Property (GIP) scheme outlined in earlier work, this article envisions a concrete image for the institutional and procedural construction of the entire system. The GIP system is designed to impose a levy on patent applicants/owners in three forms: GIP Reserve, GIP Premium and GIP Tax, which would establish a GIP Trust Fund to facilitate the unimpeded prevalence of eco/socio-friendly technologies. From this Fund, the system would disburse GIP Financial Assistance in two forms: GIP Insurance and GIP Aid, which would make it possible for users lacking capital to access necessary technologies. Since this financial assistance would ultimately pass to patentees, the system would convince patent applicants/owners to bear the cost for the GIP Trust Fund. The GIP system would be operated by the International Bank for Intellectual Property (IBIP), a financing institution proposed to be an <b>affiliated</b> <b>entity</b> of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Previous estimations have concluded that the Fund could reach several tens of billions of US dollars annually, which would substantially accelerate the distribution of various eco/socio-friendly technologies, typically including renewable energy technologies such as solar power generation and essential medicines such as AIDS/HIV drugs...|$|E
