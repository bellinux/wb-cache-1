40|$|Leprosy {{is caused}} by a {{bacterium}} that attacks the peripheral nerves. This may cause nerve function impairment (NFI), resulting in handicaps and disabilities. Therefore, prediction and prevention of NFI is extremely important in the management of leprosy. In 2000, a prediction rule for NFI was published, but circumstances have changed since the study was performed in the 1990 s: the leprosy detection delay has shortened and the definition of NFI has changed. The original rule used ‘leprosy classification’ and ‘NFI present at diagnosis’ to predict future NFI. In the current patient population we studied an <b>adjusted</b> <b>rule</b> based on ‘leprosy classification’ and ‘presence of antibodies’. This <b>adjusted</b> <b>rule</b> predicted NFI more often than the original rule. With the <b>adjusted</b> <b>rule</b> it is now also possible to assess NFI risk before the first nerve damage event takes place. This may help doctors and health workers to improve surveillance for people at high risk. Early detection and treatment can then prevent permanent disabilities...|$|E

I evaluate the economic value of trading rules by estimat-ing the weight of trading rules in the optimal portfolios of investors with power utility preferences. I find that {{on the basis of}} gross returns trading rules form a significant weight in optimal portfolios. This ap-pears to be due to the low correlation with index returns and the skewed pattern of rule returns. However, these benefits do no sur-vive the reality check imposed by transaction costs. After allowing for transaction costs, optimal portfolios rarely include trading rules. These findings, both before and after trading costs, generally persist for several years. This suggests that rule returns are consistent with market efficiency. JEL Classification: E 11, G 2...|$|E

40|$|Non-relativistic quantum {{mechanics}} is reconstructed here with a different approach. The approach takes the relational property among quantum systems, instead of the independent property of a quantum system, as a foundation to formulate the quantum theory. The idea leads to a new framework to calculate the probability when measuring a quantum system. The relational information is quantified in a matrix representation, and the probability is postulated to be proportional to the summation of the probe-response relational information from all applicable alternatives. The rule to count the alternatives depends on the entanglement between the systems. Born's rule is deduced from this framework. The wave function {{is found to be}} a summation of relational information. Entanglement brings in inference information thus the rule to count alternatives is adjusted. Mathematically, the reduced density matrix method implements this <b>adjusted</b> <b>rule.</b> Schrödinger Equation is recovered when there is no entanglement in the relational information, while measurement theory is derived when there is change in the entanglement measure. The Feynman Path Integral can be naturally integrated into the framework, and further generalized to describe an entangled system. A quantum state is relational in nature; However, the objectivity of a quantum state can be preserved via synchronization of information among observers. Comment: 47 pages, 3 figures.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} empirically {{the effect}} of financial frictions and public debt on economic variables and seeks for an appropriate fiscal consolidation strategy. First, the thesis explores the determinants of output volatility, especially the roles of financial development and government debt. The analysis, based on a panel of 127 countries over four decades, employs system GMM dynamic panel regression. According to the regression results financial development is estimated to have a non-linear effect on output volatility. Increased government debt levels are statistically associated with increased macroeconomic volatility. However, we need {{to interpret the results}} carefully due to endogeneity problems. The effect of the interactions between the two is insignificant. Second, it analyses the role of financial frictions on economic fluctuations. When the three models are compared with the U. S. data along the second moments, the firm friction model helps in fitting some macroeconomic variables and outperforms the other models. In the impulse response functions, we find that financial frictions greatly amplify and propagate the effects of the exogenous shocks on economic variables. Specially, the firm friction model shows more persistent response than the bank friction model. In addition, the size of the response depends on the leverage in the model with financial frictions. Third, the thesis considers how the effects of fiscal policy consolidation differ depending on alternative strategies. To do this, we develop an open economy DSGE model with an endogenous risk premium mechanism. The government consumption cut has larger negative effects on output than the government investment cut because of a complementarity with private consumption. The response of the tax hike is smaller than the expenditue cut because the tax hikes reduce more debts and the lower risk premium crowds in consumption and investment. Among three fiscal rules, the expenditure <b>adjusted</b> <b>rule</b> is the most effective for both preventing the economic downturn and reducing government debt...|$|E

40|$|Generally, {{rule-based}} systems work to {{make sense}} of a large volume of alerts generated by the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) every minute. Hence, it is very significant to verify that these systems are error-free and that the rules are suitable for the current network. This topic is addressed by Rule Adjustment, which automatically <b>adjusts</b> the <b>rules</b> based on the current network environment. The problem with the rule adjustment is to adjust the internal thresholds and to keep the structure unchanged. In this paper, we propose a method for <b>adjusting</b> the <b>rules,</b> online. This method does the threshold adjustment without changing the structure of the rules. Here, our approach for online threshold adjustment is to monitor the alerts and detect constant changes in them.

Our approach was successfully able to <b>adjust</b> the <b>rules</b> in all the cases with marginal error...|$|R
40|$|Fault {{detection}} for {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) {{has been}} studied intensively in recent years. Most existing works statically choose the manager nodes as probe stations and probe the network at a fixed frequency. This straightforward solution leads however to several deficiencies. Firstly, by only assigning the fault detection task to the manager node the whole network is out of balance, and this quickly overloads the already heavily burdened manager node, which in turn ultimately shortens the lifetime of the whole network. Secondly, probing with a fixed frequency often generates too much useless network traffic, which results in a waste of the limited network energy. Thirdly, the traditional algorithm for choosing a probing node is too complicated {{to be used in}} energy-critical wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we study the distribution characters of the fault nodes in wireless sensor networks, validate the Pareto principle that a small number of clusters contain most of the faults. We then present a Simple Random Sampling-based algorithm to dynamic choose sensor nodes as probe stations. A dynamic <b>adjusting</b> <b>rule</b> for probing frequency is also proposed {{to reduce the number of}} useless probing packets. The simulation experiments demonstrate that the algorithm and <b>adjusting</b> <b>rule</b> we present can effectively prolong the lifetime of a wireless sensor network without decreasing the fault detected rate...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince the Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 2001, it has drawn a world-wide attention mainly because of its balanced combination of exploration and exploitation and ease of application.

However, a series of papers was recently published by an author which insisted that the HSA is equivalent to an evolution strategy (ES). The ES, based on ideas of adaptation and evolution, consists of two operators: recombination and mutation operators. Except the similarity in generating a single new solution at each iteration which can replace the worst solution in the population, other components (e. g., their exploration and exploitation strategies and structure) are totally different between the HSA and ES.

30|$|In the {{earliest}} form of ML, rules {{were used to}} produce decision trees needed to build algorithms that extracted named entities in unstructured texts. Nowadays, ML uses algorithms {{that are designed to}} allow a computer to learn from statistical regularities or other patterns found in data.

In supervised ML, to classify entities, a model is trained on an annotated (manually tagged by human experts) set of documents (corpus). The semi-supervised ML is a hybrid system that uses a combination of annotated and non-annotated data, machine learning, and rule-based approach [6]. To improve the training process, human experts are selectively given training examples to label while other training examples are automatically labeled by the machines [19, 21]. ML algorithms that are fully automated learn rules in an unsupervised way from data that has not been pre hand-annotated.|$|R
