5|$|Following {{the death}} of his father in 1894, Riley began regretting his choice not to marry or have children. To {{compensate}} for the lack of his own children, he became a doting uncle, showering gifts on his nieces <b>and</b> <b>nephews.</b> He had repurchased his childhood home in 1893 and allowed his divorced sister, Mary, his widowed sister-in-law, Julia, and their daughters to live in the home. He provided for all their needs and spent the summer months of 1893 living with them. He took his nephew Edmund Eital as a personal secretary and gave him a $50,000 wedding gift in 1912. Riley was well loved by his family.|$|E

5|$|Simon Keynes saw Æthelstan's law-making as his {{greatest}} achievement. His reign predates the sophisticated {{state of the}} later Anglo-Saxon period, but his creation of the most centralised government England had yet seen, with the king and his council working strategically to ensure acceptance of his authority and laws, laid the foundations on which his brothers <b>and</b> <b>nephews</b> would create {{one of the wealthiest}} and most advanced systems of government in Europe. Æthelstan's reign built upon his grandfather's ecclesiastical programme, consolidating the local ecclesiastical revival and laying the foundation for the monastic reform movement later in the century.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice fell in {{love with}} Prince Henry of Battenberg, the son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine and Julia von Hauke and {{brother-in-law}} of her niece Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. After a year of persuasion, Queen Victoria, whose consent was required pursuant to the Royal Marriages Act, finally agreed to the marriage, which took place at Whippingham on the Isle of Wight on 23 July 1885. Queen Victoria consented on condition that Beatrice and Henry make their home with her and that Beatrice continue her duties as the Queen's unofficial secretary. The Prince and Princess had four children, but 10 years into their marriage, on 20 January 1896, Prince Henry died of malaria while fighting in the Anglo-Asante War. Beatrice remained at her mother's side until Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901. Beatrice devoted the next 30 years to editing Queen Victoria's journals as her designated literary executor and continued to make public appearances. She died at 87, outliving all her siblings, two of her children, and several nieces <b>and</b> <b>nephews</b> including George V and Wilhelm II.|$|E
5|$|The {{maker of}} the work is unknown; it is not signed or marked, and goldsmiths of the period rarely did this. There are a number of goldsmiths' names known from {{accounts}} and other records, but none of the few surviving works can be attached to a particular maker. Paris was the centre of production for the great numbers of joyaux, secular and religious, produced for the extended Valois royal family and other buyers. Berry and his brothers <b>and</b> <b>nephews</b> had goldsmiths on salaries or retainers for what must have been a continuous flow of commissions, whose results are tersely catalogued in various inventories of the period, but of which there are now only a handful of survivals. Only one item mentioned in the records of the Berry collection might match the reliquary, but this was made after 1401, which conflicts with the date suggested by the heraldry. Another possibility is that the reliquary was made and given as a gift, as many such pieces were, in between inventories.|$|E

25|$|Realizing {{that the}} 17th Street Elementary school {{provided}} better books and educational benefits, Mendez {{and her husband}} Gonzalo, decided {{that they would like}} to have their children <b>and</b> <b>nephews</b> enrolled in there. Thus, in 1943, when her daughter Sylvia Mendez was only eight years old, she accompanied her aunt Sally Vidaurri, her brothers and cousins to enroll at the 17th Street Elementary School. Her aunt was told by school officials that her children, who had light skin, would be permitted to enroll - but that neither Sylvia Mendez nor her brothers would be allowed because they were dark-skinned and had a Hispanic surname. Mrs. Vidaurri stormed out of the school with her children, niece <b>and</b> <b>nephews,</b> and recounted her experience to her brother Gonzalo and her sister-in-law.|$|E
