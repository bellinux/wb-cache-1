500|$|A {{meeting was}} {{arranged}} for the following day; Caroline went to a secluded room, where Leopold arrived with two aides. As Leopold II was unknown to her, Caroline was so flustered with the encounter that she mixed up Belgium and Sweden in the king's presence, referring to him as His Majesty Oscar, to his surprise and amusement. The two aides' purpose soon became clear: one sat {{on each side of}} her and began asking questions that required her to [...] "turn my head first to the right, then to the left ... their only aim, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> later, being to show off my two profiles to the mute personage", according to her memoirs. Leopold confessed himself pleased and invited Caroline to Austria with him; a large sum of money duly arrived the next day, along with some empty trunks, as Leopold was aware that she loved to buy clothes.|$|E
2500|$|Probably Myers' best-known {{contribution}} to opening theory is the eccentric line 1.c4 g5, {{a sort of}} Grob's Attack (1.g4) with colors reversed. It {{has become known as}} Myers' Defense because of his advocacy of it. When Myers discussed it in New Strategy in the Chess Openings his publisher, without consulting him, inserted in the book the remark, [...] "I can't believe that 1.c4 g5 is good for Black. There is no need to even give the reasons for my opinion; the move 1.-- g5 violates chess principles <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> them." [...] International Master John L. Watson, an authority on the English Opening, wrote that this variation [...] "has become the theoretical property of Hugh Myers, who has both played it and published proposed improvements." [...] Watson opined that the line [...] "seems playable", but it is largely ignored in general opening manuals. It is not mentioned at all in the current edition of Modern Chess Openings (2008), the Encyclopedia of Chess Openings (1996), or Batsford Chess Openings 2 (1989), and it receives only a brief footnote in Nunn's Chess Openings (1999). In the first edition of Batsford Chess Openings (1982), future World Champion Garry Kasparov famously dismissed 1...g5 with the remark that, [...] "Chess is not skittles." ...|$|E

60|$|They were {{father and}} son, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> from the {{conversation}} the elder was holding with my mother, who ministered to their wants at the table. Horace Sampson was the man's name, {{and he called}} the lad Paul.|$|E
60|$|From the {{standpoint}} of the authorities, their situation was as desperate as ours. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> afterward, the Board of Prison Directors had been summoned by telegraph, and two companies of state militia were being rushed to the prison.|$|E

60|$|My {{threat was}} unfortunate and {{resulted}} in {{more harm than good}} to Dejah Thoris, for, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> later, men do not kill women upon Mars, nor women, men. So Sarkoja merely gave us an ugly look and departed to hatch up deviltries against us.|$|E

60|$|I {{learned a}} good deal about that creed as the train fled on; and I {{wondered}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned.</b> It was a strange thing to watch that poor human soul, broken and bowed by its loss, nerving itself against each new pang of pain with the iterated assurance that it was safe against the pains of Hell.|$|E
60|$|I shut my eyes, {{being so}} very tired, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> afterwards, slept for twelve hours or more, to awake {{on the morning}} of the {{following}} day, feeling wonderfully stronger and able to eat with appetite.
