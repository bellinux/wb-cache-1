5|$|Anti-Napoleonic {{sentiment}} {{was high}} in Southern France, {{and this was}} prominently displayed in the White Terror, which saw the purge of all important Napoleonic officials from government and the execution of others. The people of France committed barbarous acts against some of these officials. Guillaume Marie Anne Brune (a Napoleonic marshal) was savagely assassinated, and his remains thrown into the Rhône River. Louis XVIII deplored such illegal acts, but vehemently supported the prosecution of those marshals that helped Napoleon in the Hundred Days. Louis XVIII's government executed Napoleon's Marshal Ney in December 1815 for treason. His confidants Charles François, Marquis de Bonnay, and the Duke de La Chatre <b>advised</b> <b>him</b> to inflict firm punishments on the “traitors”.|$|E

Despite being freed of Ares' influence, {{including}} the Blades of Chaos, Kratos was forgiven but was not relieved of his nightmares. A dissatisfied and despairing Kratos {{tried to commit suicide}} but was saved by Athena, who guided him to Olympus. Awarded the Blades of Athena, Kratos became the new God of War.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{reacted to}} his deselection by announcing {{that the people}} of Merthyr, not the local Labour Party, would decide his future. If {{physically}} fit he would contest the next election as an Independent Socialist. Friends <b>advised</b> <b>him</b> not to risk humiliation; no deselected candidate in recent times had won election against the party machine, and Davies would, they predicted, get no more than 1,000 votes. Within a few days of the deselection meeting Wilson called a snap general election, which gave the Merthyr party little time to find their new candidate. They chose Tal Lloyd, an Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) official, a long-serving councillor and a former mayor, on the moderate wing of the Labour Party, and a strong supporter of Wilson.|$|E
