5|$|There is {{a complex}} of similar {{freshwater}} and estuarine Himantura in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australasia that are or were tentatively identified with H. polylepis. The Australian freshwater Himantura were described as a separate species, H. dalyensis, in 2008. The freshwater Himantura in New Guinea are probably H. dalyensis rather than H. polylepis, though confirmation awaits further study. Trygon fluviatilis from India, as described by Nelson Annandale in 1909, closely resembles and may be conspecific with H. polylepis. On the other hand, comparison of freshwater whipray DNA and amino acid sequences between India and Thailand has revealed significant differences. Finally, <b>additional</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> needed to assess the degree of divergence amongst populations of H. polylepis inhabiting various drainage basins across its distribution, so as to determine whether further taxonomic differentiation is warranted.|$|E

25|$|The {{data on the}} {{relationship}} between diet and prostate cancer is poor. In light of this the rate of prostate cancer is linked to the consumption of the Western diet. There is little if any evidence to support an association between trans fat, saturated fat and carbohydrate intake and risk of prostate cancer. Evidence regarding the role of omega-3 fatty acids in preventing prostate cancer does not suggest that they reduce the risk of prostate cancer, although <b>additional</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> needed. Vitamin supplements appear to have no effect and some may increase the risk. High calcium intake has been linked to advanced prostate cancer. Consuming fish may lower prostate cancer deaths but does not appear to affect its occurrence. Some evidence supports lower rates of prostate cancer with a vegetarian diet. There is some tentative evidence for foods containing lycopene and selenium. Diets rich in cruciferous vegetables, soy, beans and other legumes may be associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer, especially more advanced cancers.|$|E

25|$|Right {{hemisphere}} damage {{can lead}} to aprosodia—the inability to produce or comprehend emotional prosody of language. Emotional prosody is typically conveyed and interpreted through changes in pitch, rhythm, or loudness (Leon et al., 2005). Research thus far has focused primarily on motoric-imitative and cognitive-linguistic approaches to prosody treatment. In a motoric-imitative approach, the client imitates clinician-modeled sentences produced with target emotional prosody. Modeling and cueing is gradually reduced following a six-step hierarchy until the client reaches independent production. In the cognitive-linguistic approach, the client is prompted to produce sentences {{with the support of}} cue cards. Cues include the name of the target emotion, the vocal characteristics of the emotional tone, and a picture of a corresponding facial expression. Again, cues are gradually removed as the client progresses toward independent production. Clinical studies of small groups of participants (four participants; 14 participants.) revealed statistically significant gains in the production of emotional prosody following treatment. <b>Additional</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> needed to replicate the results of the limited studies that have been conducted thus far, to evaluate the efficacy of additional treatment approaches, and to compare the relative efficacy of different approaches.|$|E
500|$|In the two {{predominant}} mutations of NSML ( [...] and [...] ) {{the mutations}} cause {{a loss of}} catalytic activity of the SHP2 protein (the gene product of the PTPN11 gene), which is a previously unrecognized behavior for this class of mutations. This interferes with growth factor and related signalling. While further research confirms this mechanism, <b>additional</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> needed to determine how this relates {{to all of the}} observed effects of NSML.|$|E
500|$|If {{the carbon}} in {{freshwater}} is partly acquired from aged carbon, such as rocks, then {{the result will}} be a reduction in the / ratio in the water. For example, rivers that pass over limestone, which is mostly composed of calcium carbonate, will acquire carbonate ions. Similarly, groundwater can contain carbon derived from the rocks through which it has passed. These rocks are usually so old that they no longer contain any measurable , so this carbon lowers the / ratio of the water it enters, which can lead to apparent ages of thousands of years for both the affected water and the plants and freshwater organisms that live in it. This is known as the hard water effect because it is often associated with calcium ions, which are characteristic of hard water; other sources of carbon such as humus can produce similar results. [...] The effect varies greatly and there is no general offset that can be applied; <b>additional</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> usually needed to determine the size of the offset, for example by comparing the radiocarbon age of deposited freshwater shells with associated organic material.|$|E

2500|$|Previous {{studies have}} theorized that CSE is an {{underlying}} (i.e., latent) trait {{that explains the}} relationship between locus of control, neuroticism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. [...] However, {{it has also been}} suggested that core self-evaluations can be conceptualized as an [...] "aggregate construct," [...] which is composed of or predicted by its four dimensions. In other words, an individual's levels on each of these traits may predict their level of core self-evaluations as opposed to the other way around. This conceptualization difference has important implications for how CSE is measured and, thus, has important implications for the effects found when researching this construct. For this reason, <b>additional</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> necessary to examine this conceptualization discrepancy.|$|E
2500|$|Right {{hemisphere}} damage {{can lead}} to deficits in discourse abilities, including difficulty with interpretation of abstract language, making inferences, and understanding nonverbal cues. In particular, individuals with right hemisphere damage struggle with the skilled use of context to interpret and express ideas. A study of five participants with right hemisphere damage found that participants’ ability to orally interpret metaphors was statistically significantly improved following a five-week structured training intervention. The training program included five phases focused on facilitating the use of word meanings and semantic associations to increase participants’ understanding of metaphors. [...] Another study of three participants found that a contextual stimulation treatment increased participants’ ability to efficiently activate distantly associated meanings and to suppress contextually inappropriate meanings. Again, <b>additional</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> needed to replicate and extend results, but the emerging literature represents a small step toward evidence-based treatments for right hemisphere damage.|$|E
