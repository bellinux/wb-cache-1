40|$|The key {{drivers of}} growth in the European life {{insurance}} market are undisputed : the persistent need for additional protection against risks, the desire on the part of savers to optimize their return on investment, and the ability of banking channels to capture an increasing amount of life insurance business. Moreover, we need to rethink the indicators we use to measure growth in the life insurance market. Premium income no longer appears to be the best indicator, and <b>actuarial</b> <b>reserves</b> and net income are increasingly used as relevant indicators of growth trends.

40|$|The stormy years {{following}} {{introduction of the}} single market appear to be over at last. In {{spite of the fact}} that the premium level in the main segments was cut for good, insurers were for the first time able to impose substantial increases in premium rates in 2001, a development which is reflected in the consumer price index. Premium revenues were also augmented by a greater number of insured risks. The need for Austrian insurers to correct their price policy was driven chiefly by the negative actuarial results of the property and liability insurance. More than a third of the insurers in this business were unable to compensate losses from the actual insurance business by income from investment. Echoing the overall economic development, income from premiums on life insurance also showed stunted growth in 2001. The only volume to develop with genuine dynamism was that of annuity insurance premiums (+ 42. 8 percent). Payouts from life insurance rose dramatically in 2001, as a consequence of the 1996 tax reform which produced a surge in advanced insurance contracts. Those contracts are now beginning to mature. Demand for supplementary health insurance coverage has been declining for years, but insurers could still boost revenues by increasing premium payments. Expenditure on claims was affected by an increase of almost 3 percent in the number of claims incurred. After the disasters of 2000, the number of claims incurred levelled off throughout the property liability insurance sector. Developments in both revenues and expenditures markedly moderated the claims ratio for the entire business segment. In 2001, private insurers recorded the lowest growth rate of provisions during the past decade. The lower growth rate in <b>actuarial</b> <b>reserves</b> for life insurance was not fully compensated by the upswing in the two other segments. With regard to the portfolio structure, the shift from loans to mutual funds continues; cash holdings expanded considerably in 2001. The return on investment dipped slightly, so that the gap to the yield on federal bonds narrowed to some 1. 5 percentage points.

40|$|Among {{business}} sectors, {{the insurance}} industry {{is known for its}} great variation of real net output over the year – a pattern generated less by smoothly incoming revenue flows from premium payments, but primarily by the accidental nature of loss events. Thus, when observing the real net output over time, the high proportion of transfers within the risk pool as a ratio of overall transactions in {{the insurance industry}} needs to be considered. To this end, Eurostat specifies a precise procedure and adjusts the payment flows by transfers. The National Accounts describe the value of all final products and services produced within a given period in Austria. They illustrate economic activities from three points of view: production, use and income distribution. As a mirror of the national income accounting, the capital finance account comprises the assets and liabilities of individual business sectors. The insurance industry plays just a small part in the national income accounting, but a comparatively larger one in the capital finance account. Private insurance is quite a small sector, at just 1. 5 percent of the real value added. In the NACE classification scheme of economic activities, Eurostat has assigned it a two-digit group of its own, together with the pension funds (NACE 66). The low contribution to the real net output is due to the high degree of asset transfers within the risk pool. Much of the insurance premiums received is paid out again by way of benefits to households or companies that have suffered losses. Moreover, life and health insurance contracts involve capital accumulation over time, since benefits as a rule are paid {{out at the end of}} the contract period. In view of its high investment volumes, the insurance business is a major economic factor in the capital finance account. Gross output of the insurance industry is computed year-round by WIFO using Eurostat's "B method". This method provides for the claims payments and increase in <b>actuarial</b> <b>reserves</b> to be deducted from the premium intakes and investment income. In view of the considerable variations in claims, this method produces high rates of change between quarterly values. Using preliminary values directly in the quarterly accounts would affect the business cycle pattern, so that the quarterly values are subjected to a dampening mechanism while retaining the year-round pattern.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} new systematic {{procedures to}} estimate aggregate unpaid claims {{as of the}} current accounting date.

The accounting date framework provides a fresh perspective which differs from traditional <b>actuarial</b> <b>reserving</b> methods that typically derive unpaid claim estimates using individual accident year experience. Current accounting date aggregate unpaid claims are directly estimated from the emergence of aggregate claim experience which had been unpaid as of prior accounting dates. Exploration of this accounting date framework leads to techniques that may be understood as accounting date analogues of commonly used accident year reserving methods including the incurred development and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. In addition to revealing visibly apparent aggregate unpaid claim estimates, the structure of appropriate accounting date reserving applications suggests improved accuracy over corresponding accident year development methods...|$|R
40|$|To meet future {{liabilities}} {{general insurance}} companies will set-up reserves. Predicting future cash-flows {{is essential in}} this process. <b>Actuarial</b> loss <b>reserving</b> methods will help them {{to do this in}} a sound way. The last decennium a vast literature about stochastic loss reserving for the general insurance business has been developed. Apart from few exceptions, all of these papers are based on data aggregated in run-off triangles. However, such an aggregate data set is a summary of an underlying, much more detailed data base that is available to the insurance company. We refer to this data set at individual claim level as "micro-level data. " We investigate whether the use of such micro-level claim data can improve the reserving process. A realistic micro-level data set on liability claims (material and injury) from a European insurance company is modeled. Stochastic processes are specified for the various aspects involved {{in the development of a}} claim: the time of occurrence, the delay between occurrence and the time of reporting to the company, the occurrence of payments and their size and the final settlement of the claim. These processes are calibrated to the historical individual data of the portfolio and used for the projection of future claims. Through an out-of-sample prediction exercise we show that the micro-level approach provides the actuary with detailed and valuable reserve calculations. A comparison with results from traditional <b>actuarial</b> <b>reserving</b> techniques is included. For our case-study reserve calculations based on the micro-level model are to be preferred; compared to traditional methods, they reflect real outcomes in a more realistic way...|$|R
40|$|Within the Solvency II {{framework}} {{the insurance}} industry requires a realistic modelling of the risk processes relevant for its business. Every insurance company should be capable of running a holistic risk management process to meet this challenge. For property and casualty (P&C) insurance companies the risk adequate modelling of the claim reserves {{is a very important}} topic as this liabilities determine up to 70 % percent of the balance sum. We propose a three dimensional (3 D) stochastic model for claim reserving. It delivers consistently the reserve's distribution function as well as the distributions of all parts of it that are needed for accounting and controlling. The calibration methods for the model are well known from data analysis and they are applicable in an practitioner environment. We evaluate the model numerically by the help of Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Classical <b>actuarial</b> <b>reserve</b> models are two dimensional (2 D). They lead to an estimation algorithm that is applied on a 2 D matrix, the run off triangle. Those methods (for instance the Chain - Ladder or the Bornhuetter - Ferguson method) are widely used in practice nowadays and give rise to several problems: They estimate the reserves' expectation and some of them - under very restriction assumptions - the variance. They provide no information about the tail of the reserve's distribution, what would be most important for risk calculation, for assessing the insurance company's financial stability and economic situation. Additionally, due to the projection of the claim process into a two dimensional space the results are very often distorted and dependent on the kind of projection. Therefore we extend the classical 2 D models to a 3 D space because we find inconsistencies generated by inadequate projections into the 2 D spaces. ...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made in the last decade in developing models to describe the distribution of unpaid losses for a line of insurance.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{takes into}} account the problem of the {{solvency}} of an insurance company referring to the reserve valuation. Considering a portfolio of deferred life annuities the paper presents a model to front this kind of problem based on the consideration of the insurance company portfolio as a block of business, that is as a cash flow of assets and liabilities. In this order of ideas, a stochastic interest environment is assumed; in particular the force of interest is supposed to be modelled by an Ornstein – Uhlenbeck process, and by means of the traditional <b>actuarial</b> functions the <b>reserve</b> is evaluated by calculating the expected value of the portfolio random loss and its variability computing the variance. Then the impact of the longevity risk on the obtained results is studied introducing projected mortality tables. Numerical applications are discussed.
