5|$|A {{chemical}} tracer is 24-isopropylcholestane, {{which is a}} stable derivative of 24-isopropylcholesterol, which {{is said to be}} produced by demosponges but not by eumetazoans ("true animals", i.e. cnidarians and bilaterians). Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> examined the biochemistry and genes of one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could not produce 24-isopropylcholesterol but that investigation of a wider range of choanoflagellates would be necessary in order to prove that the fossil 24-isopropylcholestane could only have been produced by demosponges.|$|E

5|$|Enrico Fermi and <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> at the University of Rome {{reported}} that they had discovered element 94 in 1934. Fermi called the element hesperium and mentioned it in his Nobel Lecture in 1938. The sample was actually a mixture of barium, krypton, and other elements, but this was not known at the time. Nuclear fission was discovered in Germany in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. The mechanism of fission was then theoretically explained by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch.|$|E

This makes the retention controversy moot since the virus can be easily recreated even if all samples are destroyed. Although the scientists performed the research to help development of new vaccines as well as trace smallpox's history, the possibility of the techniques being used for nefarious purposes was immediately recognized, leading to new regulation questions.|$|E

5|$|Uranium, element 92, is the {{heaviest}} {{of the elements}} that occur significantly in nature; heavier elements can only practically be produced by synthesis.

In the coming years, American scientists undoubtedly synthesized the following elements up to mendelevium, element 101, in 1955. However, starting with element 102, priority of discovery was contested between American and Soviet physicists.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> led by Eichler {{calculated}} that lawrencium's enthalpy of adsorption on metal sources would differ enough depending on its electron configuration {{that it would}} be feasible to carry out experiments to exploit this fact to measure lawrencium's electron configuration. The s2p configuration was expected to be more volatile than the s2d configuration, and be more {{similar to that of the}} p-block element lead. No evidence for lawrencium being volatile was obtained and the lower limit for the enthalpy of adsorption of lawrencium on quartz or platinum was significantly higher than the estimated value for the s2p configuration.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> {{led by the}} National Institute of Beekeeping in Bologna, Italy, found pollen {{obtained}} from seeds dressed with imidacloprid contain significant levels of the insecticide, and suggested the polluted pollen might cause honey bee colony death. Analysis of maize and sunflower crops originating from seeds dressed with imidacloprid suggest large amounts of the insecticide will be carried back to honey bee colonies. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in sucrose solution have also been documented to affect homing and foraging activity of honey bees. Imidacloprid in sucrose solution fed to bees in the laboratory impaired their communication for a few hours. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in laboratory and field experiment decreased flight activity and olfactory discrimination, and olfactory learning performance was impaired.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the crystal}} {{structure}} of linezolid {{bound to the}} 50S subunit of a ribosome from the archaean Haloarcula marismortui was elucidated by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> from Yale University and deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Another team in 2008 determined the structure of linezolid bound to a 50S subunit of Deinococcus radiodurans. The authors proposed a refined model for the mechanism of action of oxazolidinones, finding that linezolid occupies the A site of the 50S ribosomal subunit, inducing a conformational change that prevents tRNA from entering the site and ultimately forcing tRNA to separate from the ribosome.|$|E

Produced by exploitation filmmaker Roger Corman {{and his brother}} Gene, {{it was one of}} the first films directed by Bernard L.

It starred several actors who had regularly worked with Roger Corman, including Michael Emmet, Ed Nelson, Steve Dunlap, Georgianna Carter and Tyler McVey. The film was theatrically released in Dec., 1958 on a double bill with She Gods of Shark Reef.|$|E

5|$|WASP-44 is a G-type star in {{constellation}} Cetus {{that has}} the Jupiter-size planet WASP-44b in orbit. The star is slightly less massive and slightly smaller than the Sun; it is also slightly cooler, but is more metal-rich. The star was observed by SuperWASP, an organization in search of planets, starting in 2009; manual follow-up observations used WASP-44's spectrum and measurements of its radial velocity led {{to the discovery of}} the transiting planet WASP-44b. The planet and its star were presented along with WASP-45b and WASP-46b on May 17, 2011 by <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> testing the idea that Hot Jupiters tend to have circular orbits, an assumption that is made when the orbital eccentricity of such planets are not well-constrained.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> led by Owen Beattie, a {{professor}} of anthropology at the University of Alberta, began a series of scientific studies of the graves, bodies, and other physical evidence left by Franklin's men on Beechey Island and King William Island. They concluded that the men buried on Beechey Island most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, and that lead poisoning may have worsened their health, owing to badly soldered cans held in the ships' food stores. However, it was later suggested that the source of this lead may not have been tinned food, but the distilled water systems fitted to the ships. Cut marks on human bones found on King William Island were seen as signs of cannibalism. The combined evidence of all studies suggested that the crewmen did not all die quickly. Hypothermia, starvation, lead poisoning and diseases including scurvy, along with general exposure to a hostile environment whilst lacking adequate clothing and nutrition, killed everyone on the expedition in the years following its last sighting by Europeans in 1845.|$|E
5|$|In an {{underwater}} facility, <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> is {{doing research on}} mako sharks {{to help in the}} re-activation of dormant human brain cells like those found in Alzheimer's disease patients. After one of their sharks escapes the facility and attempts to attack a boat full of teenagers, financial backers send corporate executive Russell Franklin to investigate the facility. In the laboratory, doctors Susan McAlester and Jim Whitlock prove their research is working by testing a certain protein complex that was removed from the brain tissue of their largest shark. However, Jim's right arm is bitten off by the animal shortly afterwards. Brenda Kerns, the tower's operator, calls a helicopter to evacuate Jim, but as he is being lifted, the stormy weather causes Jim to fall into the shark pen. The shark then grabs Jim's stretcher and pulls the helicopter into the tower, killing Brenda and the pilots.|$|E
5|$|In late 2000, Clonaid {{announced}} that they had received a large donation to fund the cloning of a child, and that Boisselier supervised <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> at a secret laboratory in the United States who would soon produce a human clone.

This declaration received significant press coverage in the United States, and Boisselier appeared on many television programs. After a court in Florida launched a child welfare investigation, she stated that the cloned child's parents had withdrawn their offer to provide evidence of the cloning and would have no further public comment. No evidence of the cloning, or subsequent procedures reported by Clonaid, was ever offered, and the announcements were widely perceived {{to have been a}} hoax.|$|E
