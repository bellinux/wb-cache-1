He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
25|$|Furtwängler resumed conducting. On April 25, 1935, he {{returned}} to the Berlin Philharmonic with a program dedicated to Beethoven. Many people who had boycotted the orchestra during his absence came to the concert to support him. He was called out seventeen times. On May 3, in his dressing room before conducting the same program, he was informed that Hitler and his entire staff would attend the concert. He was given the order to welcome Hitler with the Nazi salute. Furtwängler was so furious that he ripped the wooden panelling off a radiator. Franz Jastrau, the manager of the orchestra, suggested that he keep his baton in his right hand <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> he entered the hall, all the Nazi leaders were present making the Hitler salute, but Furtwängler kept hold of his baton and began the concert immediately. Hitler probably could not have imagined that such an affront was possible but decided to put up a good show: he sat down and the concert went on.|$|E
25|$|In {{place of}} these, Gowen {{proposed}} his own reorganization plan based, one more time, upon optimistic earnings estimates {{and his ability}} to attract new money into the company. Also, one more time, his oration carried the audience into great enthusiasm. Such was the momentum generated by Gowen's overall campaign that Keim conceded the January 1886 presidential election in advance; Gowen and his Board of Managers slate were elected unanimously and adopted a resolution calling for a change in the receivership. Notwithstanding the optimistic reorganization plan Gowen rode back into the presidency, shareholder enthusiasm and a board resolution were insufficient to remove the Reading from its deeply troubled circumstance. Before Gowen was able to mobilize any of the money required to take action, Morgan reentered the arena, this time heading a syndicate that offered to return peace and prosperity to the company through a different means. An anonymous member of Morgan's syndicate described a central element of the proposed peace:In order to do this it has been found necessary to get rid of Mr. Gowen. We have all combined {{to get him out of}} railroad management, just as all the powers of Europe combined to crush Napoleon, and there will be no peace until Mr. Gowen is in St. Helena. He is an able and brilliant man and in some respects a veritable Napoleon, but he is no railroad manager.... The trouble with Mr. Gowen is that he wants to be fighting <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> he was after the Molly Maguires he was in his element, but as a railroad manager he is a failure.|$|E

2500|$|The character's [...] "scantily clad" [...] attire {{has been}} commented {{on in the}} British tabloid press, with Tony Stewart from [...] the Daily Mirror {{suggesting}} that Gemma Bissix might [...] "turn up in Albert Square starkers next". In May 2008, Clare was shown dressed as Princess Leia, and according to Stewart she looked like [...] "a porno version" [...] of the Star Wars character, [...] "in white hot pants and a skimpy top that [...] her galactic orbs to bounce about". In {{an article in the}} Daily Mail, the journalist suggested that the character had quickly made a name for herself [...] "thanks to her plunging necklines and knee-high boots [...] dressed in a tight, short silver dress and fishnet tights [...] her love of fitted clothes has attracted the attention of many of Albert Square's male residents." [...] Commenting on her character's revealing clothing, Bissix has said, [...] "I wasn't aware {{she was going to be}} so scantily clad. I knew she was going to be a minx but not that she was going to wear so little so often.

2500|$|The character's first return storyline {{concentrated}} on her attempt to seduce and then blackmail wealthy resident Ian Beale (played by Adam Woodyatt). [...] "Clare's a chancer," [...] explains Bissix, [...] "She sees Ian as a route to easy money!" [...] The Sun newspaper reported that [...] "Ian is mesmerised" [...] by Clare's attempts to lure {{him away from}} his wife Jane (Laurie Brett). Commenting on the storyline, Bissix said [...] "Clare knows Ian is married! But that makes it more of a challenge." [...] Eventually Clare's true motive was unearthed. After Ian nearly relented to her attempts at seduction, she proceeded to blackmail him. An EastEnders insider said: [...] "Ian has been completely blown away by Clare ever since {{she returned to the}} Square. She is a saucy little minx and will stop at nothing to get him into bed. But she’s not really interested in him – she just wants his money. So Ian is really playing with fire and risking his marriage just by being alone with Clare. But he’s more of a silly old fool than anything – although I’m not sure that Jane will see it like that, especially if she finds out about their kiss. And Clare being Clare, she probably will – unless of course Ian pays her to keep quiet." [...] However, in the storyline, Clare's games were eventually halted when Ian confessed to Jane and she ordered Clare to [...] "Stay away from Ian!". According to Bissix, filming these scenes was particularly hard for Adam Woodyatt, who knew her well when she was only a child from her first stint in the soap: [...] "Poor Adam. He spent a day staring at my chest for one scene, trying to get the fact that the last time he saw me I was 14 out of his head. He was a friend of Nigel so he was around <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> I was first here and we'd done scenes together.
