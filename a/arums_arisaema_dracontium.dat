It consists of 2200 hectares of mixed terrain of which almost 40% is open water, marsh or swamp and provides a habitat for resident and migrant birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and plants. It {{is home to the}} Green Dragon, <b>Arisaema</b> <b>dracontium,</b> a plant listed as vulnerable in Canada. It is managed by a volunteer organization, the Friends of Hullett, to benefit the wildlife of the area and provide day-use recreation activities.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{it shares}} the {{temperate}} climate found in Southern Ontario, {{its proximity to}} Lake Ontario moderates winter temperatures and it also benefits from a sheltering effect of the Niagara Escarpment, allowing the most northerly tracts of Carolinian forest to thrive on the Escarpment that runs through western sections of city. Several species of flora and fauna usually found only in more southern climes have their only Canadian presence here including paw-paw, green dragon (<b>Arisaema</b> <b>dracontium),</b> tuckahoe (Peltandra virginica), American columbo (Frasera carolinensis), wall-rue (Asplenium ruta-muraria), plus the Louisiana waterthrush, the hooded warbler, the southern flying squirrel and the rare eastern pipistrelle.

50|$|Within {{the genus}} <b>Arisaema,</b> A. <b>dracontium</b> is {{classified}} in the section Tortuosa and is most {{closely related to the}} Mexican A. macrophyllum. In fact, A. macrophyllum has sometimes been considered a subspecies of A. dracontium. The rest of the section contains species from east Asia and India. A. dracontium is not a close relative to the other American Arisaema species, A. triphyllum (jack-in-the-pulpit), which is in a different section of Arisaema.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Arisaema</b> <b>dracontium</b> (dragon-root, green dragon) is a {{herbaceous}} perennial {{plant in}} the genus Arisaema and the family Araceae. It is native to North America from Quebec through Minnesota south through Florida and Texas, where it is found growing in damp woods. It has also been reported from northeastern Mexico (Nuevo León + Veracruz) Plants grow 20 - 50 cm tall when in bloom and after flowering reach 100 cm, and each grows from a corm. [...] Normally, a plant produces one leaf with a long petioles, its leaf is composed of 7 to 13 leaflets, with its central leaflet being the largest one and with leaflets becoming smaller as they are produced distally, the leaflets are held out horizontally over the plant. During flowering in spring, a single slender, green spathe 3 - 6 cm long is produced; it covers a tapering, long thin spadix. The tail-like spadix grows out {{around the top of}} its spathe. After flowering, up to 150 berries are produced in a club-shaped column. In late summer, the green berries turn orange-red, each berry produces 1 to 3 seeds. It is listed as a vulnerable species in Canada.|$|R

40|$|Arisaema species exhibit gender diphasy, or sex change, where {{individual}} plants produce either male, monoecious {{or female}} inflorescences {{depending on their}} size. Three basic sex-change patterns have been described in Arisaema. Type I species change between male and monoecious phases, type II species change between male, monoecious and female phases, while type III species change {{between male and female}} phases. Theoreti-cal models suggest that sex ratios should be biased toward males, the sex with the lowest cost of reproduction. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine sex-ratio variation among Arisaema species that differ in sex-change patterns. Data from an extensive literature review, consisting of all available studies reporting Arisaema sex ratios, were combined with data from extensive field surveys of <b>Arisaema</b> <b>dracontium</b> and <b>Arisaema</b> triphyllum in southern Indiana, USA. This data set contains nearly 30 000 plants from 12 species. All species conformed to either the type I or type III pattern of sex change. There was little evidence for a distinct type II pattern of sex change, given that plants with monoecious inflorescences were rare relative to plants with pistillate inflorescences. The mean sex ratio in type I species (79. 9 % male) was significantly greater than in type III species (63. 7 % male). The data are consistent with the prediction that type I species are likely to have greater costs associated with female reproduction. We suggest that all Arisaema species have similar patterns of floral development, but differ in their ontogenetic patterns for male and female flowering...|$|R
40|$|<b>Arisaema</b> <b>dracontium</b> is an aroid {{perennial}} herb which {{grows in}} wooded floodplains. It occurs throughout {{a large part}} of eastern North America, but is considered rare at the northern periphery of its range which includes Canada and a number of northeastern states in the USA. The genetic structure, fertility and fecundity of A. dracontium was studied across the species 2 ̆ 7 range in order to assess whether those aspects of the population biology leave the species more vulnerable in the northern ecological margins. The study of genetic structure was preceded by an analysis of the mode of inheritance of the species in order to correctly interpret isozyme banding patterns. Existing evidence from chromosome counts and morphology suggest that A. dracontium is diploid in parts of Florida and an autotetraploid throughout the rest of its range. The mode of inheritance was investigated by examining banding patterns from cellulose acetate allozyme electrophoresis. Unbalanced heterozygotes and tri-allelic loci were observed in tetraploid cytotypes; however, only balanced heterozygotes and di-allelic loci were observed in diploid cytotypes. This is consistent with disomic and tetrasomic inheritance, respectively, and also supports the hypothesis that tetraploid cytotypes are autotetraploid in nature. A survey of allozyme variation revealed that genic and clonal diversity is high {{in all parts of the}} species 2 ̆ 7 range although population differentiation and the number of unique twelve-locus allelomorphs was higher in the northern periphery. A single Florida population was sampled, and found to be markedly distinct from all the other populations. Fertility and fecundity were extremely variable in all regions of the range. Fertility was not lower in the northern marginal areas, however, highly fecund populations had significantly lower seed mass and somewhat lower seed set in the northern margins relative to populations elsewhere in the species 2 ̆ 7 range.
