5|$|In 2009, the Royal National Theatre {{created a}} stage {{version of the}} book, adapted and {{directed}} by Katie Mitchell. Seussical, a musical adaptation that incorporates aspects of many Dr. Seuss works, features the Cat in the Hat as narrator. The musical received weak reviews when it opened, in November 2001, but eventually became a staple in regional and school theaters. The Cat also stars in the 1982 television film The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat and the 2010 animated television series The Cat in the Hat Knows <b>a</b> <b>Lot</b> <b>About</b> <b>That!</b> A ride at Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure park in Orlando, Florida, is based around The Cat in the Hat.|$|E

25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

2500|$|Four {{television}} series have been adapted from Geisel's work. The first, Gerald McBoing-Boing, was an animated television adaptation of Geisel's 1951 cartoon {{of the same}} name and lasted three months between 1956 and 1957. The second, The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss, was a mix of live-action and puppetry by Jim Henson Television, the producers of The Muppets. It aired for one season on Nickelodeon in the United States, from 1996 to 1997. The third, Gerald McBoing-Boing, is a remake of the 1956 series. Produced in Canada by Cookie Jar Entertainment (now DHX Media) and North America by Classic Media (now DreamWorks Classics), it ran from 2005 to 2007. The fourth, The Cat in the Hat Knows <b>a</b> <b>Lot</b> <b>About</b> <b>That!,</b> produced by Portfolio Entertainment Inc., began on August 7, 2010, in Canada and September 6, 2010, in the United States and is currently still showing.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was a warm}} golden evening, fit for October, and I was {{watching}} (with regret) {{a lot of little}} black pigs being turned out of my garden, when the postman handed to me, with a perfunctory haste which doubtless masked his emotion, the Declaration of Futurism. If you ask me what Futurism is, I cannot tell you; even the Futurists themselves seem a little doubtful; perhaps they are waiting for the future to find out. But if you ask me what its Declaration is, I answer eagerly; for I can tell you quite <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> It is written by an Italian named Marinetti, in a magazine which is called Poesia. It is headed [...] "Declaration of Futurism" [...] in enormous letters; it is divided off with little numbers; and it starts straight away like this: [...] "1. We intend to glorify the love of danger, the custom of energy, the strengt of daring. 2. The essential elements of our poetry will be courage, audacity, and revolt. 3. Literature having up to now glorified thoughtful immobility, ecstasy, and slumber, we wish to exalt the aggressive movement, the feverish insomnia, running, the perilous leap, the cuff and the blow." [...] While I am quite willing to exalt the cuff within reason, it scarcely seems such an entirely new subject for literature as the Futurists imagine. It seems to me that even through the slumber which fills the Siege of Troy, the Song of Roland, and the Orlando Furioso, and in spite of the thoughtful immobility which marks [...] "Pantagruel," [...] "Henry V," [...] and the Ballad of Chevy Chase, there are occasional gleams of an admiration for courage, a readiness to glorify the love of danger, and even the [...] "strengt of daring," [...] I seem to remember, slightly differently spelt, somewhere in literature.|$|E

5000|$|... "Stonewalled" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Meredith Blake of The A.V.

[...] TV Fanatic’s Teresa L. rated the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars, commenting [...] "This episode proved to the most compact and well-developed hour of the show.

5000|$|Despite his vocal style, Valfar did {{not relate}} his music to black metal, {{probably}} because of how the scene acted and was stereotyped.
