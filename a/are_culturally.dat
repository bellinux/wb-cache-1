5|$|Although Sri Lankan Tamils <b>are</b> <b>culturally</b> and linguistically distinct, genetic studies {{indicate}} that they {{are closely related to}} other ethnic groups in the island while being related to the Indian Tamils from South India as well.

5|$|Although Sri Lankan Tamils <b>are</b> <b>culturally</b> and linguistically distinct, genetic studies {{indicate}} that they {{are closely related to}} Sinhalese ethnic group in the island. The Sri Lankan Tamils are mostly Hindus with a significant Christian population. Sri Lankan Tamil literature on topics including religion and the sciences flourished during the medieval period in the court of the Jaffna Kingdom. Since the beginning of the Sri Lankan Civil War in the 1980s, it is distinguished by an emphasis on themes relating to the conflict. Sri Lankan Tamil dialects are noted for their archaism and retention of words not in everyday use in the Tamil Nadu state in India.|$|E

5|$|The Mikea <b>are</b> <b>culturally</b> and linguistically nearly {{identical}} to the neighboring Vezo fishing clan and Masikoro herding and farming clan of the Sakalava; only the traditional source of livelihood distinguishes the three groups. The popular association of the Mikea with the ancestral Vazimba clan has contributed to widespread belief that the Mikea possess Vazimba attributes, such as being small in stature, unclothed, shy and avoidant of contact with outsiders, and living in perfect harmony with the natural environment. None of these are borne out by evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislative}} {{intent of}} the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000 {{was to develop a}} national program to guard America's sound recording heritage. The Act resulted in the formations of the National Recording Registry, The National Recording Preservation Board and a fund-raising foundation to aid their efforts. The act established the Registry specifically for the purpose of maintaining and preserving sound recordings and collections of sound recordings that <b>are</b> <b>culturally,</b> historically, or aesthetically significant. Beginning in 2002, the National Recording Preservation Board began selecting nominated recordings each year to be preserved.|$|E
5|$|The diverse {{origins of}} Malagasy culture {{are evident in}} its {{tangible}} expressions. The most emblematic instrument of Madagascar, the valiha, is a bamboo tube zither carried to Madagascar by early settlers from southern Borneo, and is very similar in form {{to those found in}} Indonesia and the Philippines today. Traditional houses in Madagascar are likewise similar to those of southern Borneo in terms of symbolism and construction, featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar. Reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors, tombs <b>are</b> <b>culturally</b> significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material, typically stone, and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living. The production and weaving of silk {{can be traced back to}} the island's earliest settlers, and Madagascar's national dress, the woven lamba, has evolved into a varied and refined art.|$|E

A person with coprolalia may repeat the word mentally rather than saying it out loud; these subvocalizations can be very distressing.|$|E
