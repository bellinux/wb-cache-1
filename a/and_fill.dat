5|$|Acurad was a {{die casting}} process {{developed}} by General Motors {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, and dense. It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional solidification with the fast cycle times of the traditional die casting process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: thermal analysis, flow <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die castings, and indirect squeeze casting (explained below).|$|E

40|$|Our {{theme in}} this {{dissertation}} is {{the theory of}} empty <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> intentions (leere und erfüllte Intentionen), as that theory is introduced, developed, and employed in the opening years of Husserl‘s career. The first major exposition and employment of the theory is provided by Husserl‘s Logical Investigations (Logische Untersuchungen, 1900 / 1). In chapter 1, we show how the introduction of empty <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> intentions in Investigation I arises from Husserl‘s attempt {{to understand the nature}} and function of signs. In chapter 2, we turn to Husserl‘s further exploration and use of the theory of empty <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> intentions in Investigations V and VI. To elucidate the background and development of the theory of empty <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> intentions, we turn to Philosophy of Arithmetic (Philosophie der Arithmetik, 1891). In chapters 3 and 4, we uncover a series of parallels between the theory of empty <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> intentions in Logical Investigations and the theory of ―symbolic and authentic presentations‖ (symbolische und eigentliche Vorstellungen) in Philosophy of Arithmetic. This leads us to argue that the theory of empty <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> intentions is actually a more mature version of the theory of symbolic and authentic presentations...|$|R

5|$|Carbohydrates are {{aldehydes}} or ketones, {{with many}} hydroxyl groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates {{are the most}} abundant biological molecules, <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of energy (starch, glycogen) and structural components (cellulose in plants, chitin in animals). The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides and include galactose, fructose, and most importantly glucose. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form polysaccharides in almost limitless ways.|$|E

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore {{with a damp}} sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun {{with a bag of}} powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the bagged charge through the vent hole, <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.|$|E
5|$|Each {{class of}} cadets elects representatives {{to serve as}} class {{president}} <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> several administrative positions.

Each class crest is required to contain the initials USMA and their class motto. The class motto is proposed by the class during cadet basic training and voted on by the class prior {{to the beginning of}} their freshman academic year. Class mottos typically have verbiage that rhymes or is phonetically similar with their class year.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{decomposition}} of the shale into smaller fragments can affect slope stability, necessitating shallower slopes that require more material be disturbed in cut <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> work, exacerbating the {{acid rock drainage}} problem. The cut material cannot be used as fill beneath roads and structures due to volumetric expansion, compounding the problem. The Tioga ash beds contain bentonite clay which presents a landslide hazard in the unexcavated rock as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{shots of}} the teen hang-out where they play pinball were filmed in the original location of the Hog's Breath Saloon on Okaloosa Island. This restaurant later relocated to Destin, Florida as its original building was susceptible to hurricane damage.

5|$|Using a {{technique}} pioneered on Back to the Future Part II, another {{shot with a}} different lighting scheme was filmed.

Because Paramount continued to add new shots to the busy schedule and tight budget, some elements were flipped for reuse, including the star fields and {{a shot of the}} Bird of Prey firing. Whenever possible, the ships were filmed from below to reinforce the nautical theme, with their movements intended to remind the audience of galleons or other large seafaring vessels.|$|E

5|$|An {{inclined}} tramway, the ramp, {{was built}} {{from the front}} of the terrace, on the axis of the gatehouse, down towards the port area of Fremantle. The ramp, constructed between 1852 and 1853, is of limestone rubble from the cut <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> activities required to create the prison site and the terrace. The ramp is an integral part of the original design of the prison complex and is of exceptional heritage significance. It is now cut at its western end by a modern road which severs the historic visual link with Fremantle. On each side of the alignment of the ramp, where it intersects with Henderson Street, are three terrace houses for the accommodation of prison warders. These were erected between 1851 and 1858 and mark the boundary of the Convict Establishment at this point. The limestone used for the early prison and its associated housing was quarried on the site.|$|E
5|$|Dan's {{health is}} {{determined}} by a health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan runs out of health, the game will end. Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that replenish Dan's health <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> any empty Life Bottles Dan has. In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls, which can be collected if the player dispatches enough enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means). If the player clears a level with a Chalice in hand, Dan is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can speak to a hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the true ending is revealed.|$|E

The bedrock mainly occurs on the mountains {{in this part of the}} watershed. In the middle reaches of the creek, the surficial geology mainly features bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale, alluvium, and a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till. Some Wisconsinan Outwash and alluvial terrace is also present near Koonsville. Some patches of Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and wetlands are also present. In its upper reaches, the creek is almost entirely dominated by Wisconsinan Till, bedrock, and some lakes. However, there is a patch of alluvial fan immediately north of Shickshinny Lake and some Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and Wisconsinan Outwash not far from the creek's source.|$|E
