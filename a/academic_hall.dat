5|$|On September 16, 1891, University Hall, the school's first brick {{building}}, {{caught on}} fire. As {{a result of}} the fire the top two floors of the building as well as the roof were destroyed. The building was then re-built after the 1891 fire, but unlike the original plans it was constructed with a Mansard style roof. Additionally, a square tower was also built on top in lieu of the original cupola which included a school bell. From its construction until 1987, Waller Hall was used as an <b>academic</b> <b>hall</b> and hosted classes along with housing the school's chapel and as offices for the faculty.|$|E
25|$|<b>Academic</b> <b>Hall</b> burned on 9 January 1892, {{leaving only}} the famous six columns that now stand {{in the center of}} Francis Quadrangle. The fire was ignited by an {{electric}} chandelier in the meeting room, the forerunner of Jesse Auditorium, during a debate.|$|E
25|$|During the American Civil War, Union troops {{used the}} Library in <b>Academic</b> <b>Hall</b> as a guard room. The Union troops caused {{significant}} damage, including taking 467 volumes to build fires. The Board of Curators later sued the US Army {{for the destruction}} on campus. Settled in 1915, the suit's award was used to build the Memorial Gateway on {{the northern edge of}} Red Campus.|$|E

Additional computers and laboratories are spread across all of the <b>academic</b> <b>halls.</b> Welte Hall, Maloney Hall, and the Student Center function as large gathering areas for events, music performances, and theater productions. Welte contains the main auditorium and Kaiser Hall houses the main gymnasium, and houses an olympic-size pool. Fitness classes are freely available to students in Memorial Hall and fitness equipment is provided in four locations across campus through RECentral.|$|R
25|$|The {{university}} was officially founded on June 11, 1906 {{with the first}} class totaling 543 students in an off-campus facility. The first permanent campus building was <b>Academic</b> <b>Hall.</b> Its cornerstone was laid on August 10, 1907 and construction was completed in January 1909. The building {{is now known as}} Carrington Hall, named after William T. Carrington, the first president of the State Normal School. It serves as the University's administrative center.|$|E
25|$|Edmund {{became one}} of Oxford's first lecturers with a Master of Arts, but was not Oxford's first Doctor of Divinity. Long hours at night spent in prayer had the result that he often 'nodded off' during his lectures. There is a {{long-established}} tradition that he utilised his lecture-fees to build the Lady Chapel of St Peter's in the East at Oxford. The site where he lived and taught was formed into a mediaeval <b>academic</b> <b>hall</b> in his name and later incorporated as the college of St Edmund Hall. His mother influenced him towards self-denial and austerity, and this led to his taking up the study of theology.|$|E
25|$|Although {{chartered}} as a university, {{for many}} years Washington University functioned primarily as a night school located on 17th Street and Washington Avenue {{in the heart of}} downtown St. Louis. Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the St. Louis Public Schools. Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of <b>Academic</b> <b>Hall</b> and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, Smith Academy, and the Mary Institute.|$|E
50|$|The {{campus is}} 290 acre and {{includes}} a 2,200-seat gymnasium, dormitories {{for men and women}} including a married housing complex, separate lodges for the fraternities and sororities, <b>academic</b> <b>halls,</b> an administration center, baseball and softball parks, two soccer fields, an indoor swimming pool, and wellness center.|$|R
50|$|From 2014 a new indoor {{athletics}} complex will {{be constructed}} along Nevada {{in the existing}} 4-Diamonds area. North Nevada is the 2nd phase of campus in the long-term, and extreme long-term build-out calls for dozens of new buildings, <b>academic</b> <b>halls,</b> and another resident village to be built along Nevada.|$|R
50|$|The main {{campus is}} the {{original}} and largest, {{with most of the}} classrooms, administration buildings and residence halls. The Quad is anchored by Durick Library to the west and the Chapel of Saint Michael the Archangel to the east. The three <b>academic</b> <b>halls,</b> Cheray Hall, Jeanmarie Hall, and Saint Edmund's Hall, along with the McCarthy Arts Center line the Quad to the south. The Alliot Student Center and the four underclass residence halls wall the Quad on the north.|$|R
25|$|In 1891, Gardiner {{resigned}} from {{the management of the}} school and was succeeded by Rev. Theodosius Stevens Tyng. Simultaneous with the appointment of Rev. Tyng, the school's name was changed from St. Paul's School to St. Paul's College; curriculum changes were introduced; and a formal application was made for a government license. Enrollment jumped, but the school buildings were in a poor state of repair and were condemned as unsafe by government inspectors. As president of the school Tyng immediately set off to the United States on a fundraising tour. Less than three weeks after his return to Tokyo an earthquake in 1894 leveled much of the original school facilities, highlighting the perils of building on reclaimed land next to the Sumida River. The college was temporarily housed in Trinity Parish House, and by 1896 new buildings including an <b>academic</b> <b>hall</b> and student dormitory were ready for occupation.|$|E
500|$|The main {{buildings}} {{are located in}} the centre of Oxford, between Turl Street, Ship Street, Cornmarket Street and Market Street. The main entrance is on Turl Street. The {{buildings are}} arranged in three quadrangles, the first quadrangle containing the oldest college buildings and the third quadrangle the newest. The foundation charter gave to the college a site between Market Street and Ship Street (which is still occupied by the college) as well as the buildings of a defunct university <b>academic</b> <b>hall</b> on the site, called White Hall. The buildings that now surround the first quadrangle were erected in stages between 1571 and the 1620s; the principal's lodgings were the last to be built. Progress was slow because the new college lacked the [...] "generous endowments" [...] that earlier colleges enjoyed. Before new buildings were completed, the students lived in the old buildings of White Hall.|$|E
2500|$|On January 9, 1892, <b>Academic</b> <b>Hall,</b> the institution's main building, {{burned in}} a fire that {{completely}} gutted the building, leaving little more standing than six stone Ionic columns.

50|$|Another {{characteristic}} of the 20th century was the establishment of agreements with foreign institutions of university education, at first with Portuguese universities. From then on, <b>academic</b> <b>halls</b> were established for women, who became members of the university in the 1913-1914 academic year. Moreover, the number of books of the institution has been increased with new endowments, {{such as that of}} the American Library.|$|R
2500|$|Loung, Meng and Kim {{returned}} to Bat Deng in 1998 {{for a large}} family reunion with Khouy, Chou and all their relatives, including their 88-year-old grandmother. [...] The Ungs arranged a Buddhist ceremony to honor their parents, Sem and Ay, and their sisters, Keav and Geak, who had all died {{at the hands of}} the Khmer Rouge regime; the service was attended by many hundreds of relatives and friends. Two years later, her first memoir was published. In 2002, Loung married her college sweetheart, Mark Priemer, and bought two and a half acres of land in Cambodia just a short distance from her sister Chou's home. During commencement ceremonies at Saint Michael's College in May 2002, Loung was inducted into the inaugural class of the college's Alumnae <b>Academic</b> <b>Hall</b> of Fame: [...] "Saint Michael's is proud beyond measure to honor its 1993 graduate, Loung Ung". [...] In 2003, she was chosen by Saint Michael's to address the graduating class. Her second memoir was published in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Jesse Hall is {{the main}} {{administration}} building for the University of Missouri. Its dome has towered 180 feet above {{the south end of}} David R. Francis Quadrangle since its completion in 1895. In the lawn in front of Jesse Hall are The Columns, all that remains of its predecessor <b>Academic</b> <b>Hall,</b> which burned in 1892. The building contains the office of the chancellor, university registrar, graduate school, admissions, and financial aid. One of the most photographic landmarks in Missouri, the building was designed by Missouri architect Morris Frederick Bell, and is his largest surviving work. Jesse Auditorium had hosted graduations and countless university functions over the years. The University Concert Series presents national and international concerts, Broadway shows, performers, bands, speakers, and theater to the largest auditorium in Columbia. As the former home of the School of Music, student performances occasionally happen. The building is the most prominent contributing structure to the David R. Francis Quadrangle National Register of Historic Places District.

5000|$|Notable in the Thayer {{vision was}} the cloister-style {{construction}} of the school, with interconnected buildings forming an architectural ensemble in which the entire school was essentially under one roof, in many cases with dorms on the upper floors of the buildings and classrooms and other <b>academic</b> <b>halls</b> in the lower floors.
