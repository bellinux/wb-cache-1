25|$|The CTA was, however, not revoked. On the contrary, its {{implementation}} was widened. Thevar again led agitations and <b>awareness-raising</b> campaigns against the Act.

25|$|In 2012, the {{government}} of Saint Helena funded {{the creation of the}} St. Helena Human Rights Action Plan 2012–2015. Work is being done under this action plan, including publishing <b>awareness-raising</b> articles in local newspapers, providing support for members of the public with human rights queries, and extending several UN Conventions on human rights to St. Helena.|$|E
500|$|Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, {{described}} by the Index on Censorship {{as one of the}} best-known human rights activists in the world, is the co-founder of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights and a vocal critic of the government. Al-Khawaja was arrested in 2004 and 2007, and reportedly beaten in 2005 over his opposition activities. He holds Danish and Bahraini dual citizenship. His role in the uprising was much less; his activities were limited to [...] "organising peaceful <b>awareness-raising</b> and human rights education". He said he had intentionally kept himself away from the Pearl Roundabout in order to avoid [...] "giv the authorities any reason to arrest" [...] him. Salah al-Khawaja is a former member of Islamic Action Society (Amal) and brother of Abdulhadi al-Khawaja. During the uprising, he sought to document events and contact international media.|$|E
500|$|Another song on {{the album}} that deals {{with the need to}} escape the {{confines}} of society is David Crosby's [...] "Dolphin's Smile". The song was an early example of Crosby's penchant for using nautical imagery in his songs, a thematic trait he would utilize in future compositions, including [...] "Wooden Ships" [...] and [...] "The Lee Shore". The theme of unfettered idyllic bliss is further explored in the Hillman-penned [...] "Natural Harmony". Like [...] "Goin' Back", [...] "Natural Harmony" [...] conveys a sense of longing for the innocence of youth, albeit filtered through the <b>awareness-raising</b> properties of psychedelic drugs. It has been suggested by some commentators that the song exhibits the strong influence of Crosby's writing style, with its laid-back, jazzy feel and dreamy, high tenor vocal part.|$|E
500|$|A common {{criticism}} of the plan {{is that it is}} not victim-centric and that its support for victims is insufficient. Bethany Hastie of McGill University said that the HTNCC had a good track record of intelligence assessment and <b>awareness-raising</b> with respect to human trafficking, and she therefore approved of the plan's funding of the HTNCC. She was critical of the plan's emphasis on law enforcement, saying that [...] "the crime-fighting focus of the plan has unfortunately detracted from...victim services." [...] She said that more attention to victim services was necessary because most Canadian provinces were employing only ad-hoc methods of supporting victims, often omitting important elements such as legal aid and situation-appropriate shelter. A few weeks after the establishment of the NAP-CHT, Dean Allison, MP for Niagara West—Glanbrook, Ontario travelled to Cambodia and Thailand to learn more about human trafficking as part of a parliamentary delegation with World Vision Canada, and he said that his meetings there convinced him [...] "that we are on the right track in Canada with our National Action Plan." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith's {{proposal}} received strong endorsement from {{organizations that}} support human trafficking victims and from law enforcement agencies. Marlene Jennings, a Liberal MP, praised Smith's proposal overall but {{argued that it}} did not sufficiently distinguish between human trafficking and prostitution. Smith responded that there is a clear correlation between the two issues. Callandra Cochrane of Citizens for Public Justice said that such a plan [...] "has become an imperative in order to ensure the protection of victims and effectively combat human trafficking," [...] but that Smith's proposal had [...] "definite weaknesses that need to be strengthened." [...] Cochrane praised the document's suggestions that NGOs be granted funding, that efforts be coordinated with First Nations communities, that <b>awareness-raising</b> campaigns be initiated, and that immigration be regulated. She argued that [...] "Connecting the Dots" [...] was too focused on those who create the demand for sex trafficking and did not sufficiently address victim rehabilitation. Loly Rico of the Canadian Council for Refugees made the same complaint. Rico recommended that the proposal be amended to allow human trafficking victims to become permanent residents of Canada so they would be more effectively protected against being trafficked again.|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternative}} trading organization (ATO) {{is usually}} a non-governmental organization (NGO) or mission-driven business aligned with the Fair Trade movement, aiming [...] "to contribute to the alleviation of poverty in developing {{regions of the world}} by establishing a system of trade that allows marginalized producers in developing regions to gain access to developed markets". Alternative trading organizations have Fair Trade at the core of their mission and activities, using it as a development tool to support disadvantaged producers and to reduce poverty, and combine their marketing with <b>awareness-raising</b> and campaigning.|$|E
2500|$|According to EFTA, the {{defining}} characteristic of alternative trading organizations is that of equal partnership and respect – partnership between the developing region producers and importers, shops, labelling organizations, and consumers. Alternative trade [...] "humanizes" [...] the trade process – making the producer-consumer chain as short as possible so that consumers {{become aware of the}} culture, identity, and conditions in which producers live. All actors are committed to the principle of alternative trade, the need for advocacy in their working relations and the importance of <b>awareness-raising</b> and advocacy work. Examples of such organisations are Ten Thousand Villages, Greenheart Shop, Equal Exchange and SERRV International in the US and Equal Exchange Trading, Traidcraft, Oxfam Trading, Twin Trading and Alter Eco in Europe as well as Siem Fair Trade Fashion in Australia.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2015, {{the website}} Personnel Today {{revealed}} that, {{in order to}} tackle [...] "ongoing concerns within the profession" [...] about the scheme's low profile, 'Fit For work' had [...] "linked up with conciliation service Acas to unveil a programme of <b>awareness-raising</b> events around the country". The main vehicle for raising awareness about the scheme was a roadshow featuring David Frost, the co-author of Black's 2011 report, as the keynote speaker. Personnel Today also reported criticism of the narrow scope of 'Fit for work' by AXA PPP Healthcare, an existing private occupational healthcare provider. [...] AXA's Director of Health Consulting warned that 'Fit for work' wasn't a [...] "panacea" [...] for all sickness absence issues; in particular, [...] {{he pointed out that}} the government-funded service only covered sickness absence of four weeks or more, which would not be responsive enough to address health conditions that could benefit from earlier intervention.|$|E
2500|$|The studies {{conducted}} by Ludwig, Geller, and colleagues focused on inducing drivers to use safety belts and turn signals {{and to come}} to a complete stop at intersections. The interventions assessed in this research included <b>awareness-raising,</b> safety pledges, individual and group goal-setting (with goals assigned by managers or developed by workers), directives from management, and individual and group competitions for rewards. [...] In general, the researchers found that high-involvement interventions were effective in changing the targeted behaviour, and that in some cases these also seemed to be associated with positive changes in other safe driving behaviours. [...] In addition, individualized public feedback was more effective than generic feedback, and worked well for those who were initially non-compliant with low-level, non-intrusive interventions. When external consequences were discontinued, compliance was not sustained. The researchers recommended that organizations begin with low-intensity, low-cost interventions such as group meetings, signage, or other media, progressing to more intrusive interventions for those who fail to respond to low-level interventions. They also noted that those who comply initially can be enlisted as agents of change who can influence co-workers, family, and friends to drive safely.|$|E

50|$|UN-SPIDER's {{knowledge}} management activities {{are accompanied by}} its <b>awareness-raising</b> efforts. Since <b>awareness-raising</b> is a {{process by which the}} level of understanding among the persons targeted is raised, fostering change in attitudes and behaviour, it is central to the success of promoting the use of space-based information. In the framework of UN-SPIDER, <b>awareness-raising</b> is designed as an ongoing process accompanying, facilitating and preparing activities, as new audiences are addressed, new partnerships are formed and new technological solutions are developed, offering new opportunities for existing and new target groups. UN-SPIDER implements its <b>awareness-raising</b> activities mainly via its publications such as the monthly Updates and the biannual Newsletter as well as via its Knowledge Portal.|$|E
