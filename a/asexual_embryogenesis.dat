40|$|In plants, {{embryogenesis}} generally occurs {{through the}} sexual process of double fertilization, which involves a haploid sperm cell fusing with a haploid egg cell to ultimately {{give rise to}} a diploid embryo. Embryogenesis can also occur asexually in the absence of fertilization, both in vitro and in vivo. Somatic or gametic cells are able to differentiate into embryos in vitro following the application of plant growth regulators or stress treatments. <b>Asexual</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> also occurs naturally in some plant species in vivo, from either ovule cells as part of a process defined as apomixis, or from somatic leaf tissue in other species. In both in vitro and in vivo <b>asexual</b> <b>embryogenesis,</b> the embryo precursor cells must attain an embryogenic fate without the act of fertilization. This review compares the processes of in vitro and in vivo <b>asexual</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> including what is known regarding the genetic and epigenetic regulation of each process, and considers how the precursor cells are able to change fate and adopt an embryogenic pathway...|$|E

The Ethephon effect {{could be attributed}} to volatile and nonvolatile substances. The volatile component was probably entirely ethylene. Ethylene was liberated in the cultures in direct proportion to Ethephon added to the medium. Autoclaving of Ethephon caused a substantial decrease of measurable ethylene. Continuous exposure of callus to 5 μl/l ethylene depressed somatic cell embryogenesis, but not markedly. Depression of embryogenesis by 2, 4 -D was unrelated to ethylene evolution...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- Somatic or <b>asexual</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> is {{the process}} by which somatic cells develop into plants. The rapid {{improvement}} in somatic embryogenesis methods allow the use of somatic embryos in plant micropropagation as synthetic seeds. However, practical applications of somatic embryogenesis are not limited to synthetic seed technology. Somatic embryogenesis can be used in the regeneration of genetically transformed plants, polyploid plants, or somatic hybrids. Moreover, promising results indicate the possibility to use somatic embryogenesis in cell selection programs and germplasm cryopreservation. The application of somatic embryogenesis to plant virus elimination, metabolite production, and in vitro mychorrhizal initiation has been investigated. Additional index terms: cell selection, cryopreservation, plant regeneration, somatic hybrid, transgenic plants, virus elimination...|$|E
40|$|Why does {{regeneration}} occur? And why, when it manifests itself, {{does it do}} so in some but not all metazoan species? Hence, {{what are}} the permissive or inhibitory factors operating behind this phenomenon? When it comes to regeneration, many questions, such as these, remain unanswered. In fact, the problem of animal regeneration has withstood the probing of scientific inquiry for over 250 years and still awaits a satisfactory mechanistic explanation. In this essay, I will review the distribution and the modes of regeneration that {{are found in the}} different metazoan phyla. Also, I will re-examine ideas on its evolutionary origins, and discuss its possible relationship to both <b>asexual</b> reproduction and <b>embryogenesis.</b> This endeavor has two objectives. First, to bring forward an interpretation of regeneration which integrates evolutionary and developmental considerations into its discussion. And second, to suggest a comparative experimental approach to this problem that may bring us closer to understanding the molecular basis of this long-standing biological problem.

40|$|The twofold cost of sex {{implies that}} sexual and asexual {{reproduction}} do not coexist easily. Asexual forms tend to outcompete sexuals but may eventually suffer higher extinction rates, creating tension between short- and long-term advantages of different reproductive modes. The ‘short-sightedness’ of asexual reproduction takes a particularly intriguing form in gynogenetic species complexes, {{in which an}} asexual species requires sperm from a related sexual host species to trigger <b>embryogenesis.</b> <b>Asexuals</b> are then predicted to outcompete their host, after which neither species can persist. We examine whether spatial structure can explain continued coexistence of the species complex, and assess the evidence based on data on the Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa). A modification of the Levins metapopulation model creates two regions of good prospects for coexistence, connected by a region of poorer patch occupancy levels. In the first case, mate discrimination and/or niche differentiation keep local extinction rates low, and most patches contain both species; the other possibility resembles host–parasite dynamics where parasites frequently drive the host locally extinct. Several dynamical features are counterintuitive and relate to the parasitic nature of interactions in the species complex: for example, high local extinction rates of the asexual species can be beneficial for its own persistence. This creates a link from the evolution of sexual reproduction to that of prudent predation...|$|R
40|$|Tunicates {{are useful}} models for {{comparing}} differing developmental {{processes such as}} <b>embryogenesis,</b> <b>asexual</b> reproduction, and regeneration, {{because they are the}} closest relatives to vertebrates and are the only chordates to reproduce both sexually and asexually. Among them, the ascidian Botryllus schlosseri displays high regenerative potential of the colonial circulatory system (CCS). The CCS runs in the common tunic, forming an anastomized network of vessels defined by simple epithelia and connected to the open circulatory system of the zooids. During asexual propagation, new vessels form by means of a tubular-sprouting mechanism, resembling that occurring in other metazoans, particularly during vertebrate angiogenesis. We studied the regeneration of experimentally ablated CCS by analyzing the general dynamics of reorganization of vessels and tunic, their ultrastructure, cell proliferation, and the immunohistology of regenerating structures using antibodies against vertebrate angiogenic factors-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor- 2 (FGF- 2), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and receptors: VEGFR- 1, VEGFR- 2, and EGFR. Results show that the regenerative process of CCS occurs by a sprouting mechanism, with participation of angiogenic factors. They also show correspondence between the CCS sprouting of B. schlosseri and angiogenic sprouting in vertebrates, during both normal development and regeneration, and support the idea that this morphogenetic mechanism was co-opted during the evolution of various developmental processes in different taxa...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Obligate {{intracellular}} symbionts {{of insects}} are metabolically and developmentally integrated with their hosts. Typically, reproduction fails in many insect nutritional endosymbioses when host insects are cured of their bacterial symbionts, and yet remarkably {{little is known}} about the processes that developmentally integrate host and symbiont. Here in the best studied insect obligate intracellular symbiosis, that of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, with the gammaproteobacterium Buchnera aphidicola, we tracked the expression and localization of amino acid transporter ApGLNT 1 gene products during <b>asexual</b> <b>embryogenesis.</b> Recently being characterized as a glutamine transporter, ApGLNT 1 has been proposed to be a key regulator of amino acid biosynthesis in A. pisum bacteriocytes. To determine when this important mediator of the symbiosis becomes expressed in aphid embryonic bacteriocytes, we applied whole-mount in situ hybridization and fluorescent immunostaining with a specific anti-ApGLNT 1 antibody to detect the temporal and spatial expression of ApGLNT 1 gene products during <b>asexual</b> <b>embryogenesis.</b> Results During embryogenesis, ApGLNT 1 mRNA and protein localize to the follicular epithelium that surrounds parthenogenetic viviparous embryos, where we speculate that it functions to supply developing embryos with glutamine from maternal hemolymph. Unexpectedly, in the embryonic bacteriome ApGLNT 1 protein does not localize to the membrane of bacteriocytes, a pattern that leads us to conclude that the regulation of amino acid metabolism in the embryonic bacteriome mechanistically differs from that in the maternal bacteriome. Paralleling our earlier report of punctate cytoplasmic localization of ApGLNT 1 in maternal bacteriocytes, we find ApGLNT 1 protein localizing as cytoplasmic puncta throughout development in association with Buchnera. Conclusions Our work that documents ontogenetic shifts in the localization of ApGLNT 1 protein in the host bacteriome demonstrates that maternal and embryonic bacteriomes are not equivalent. Significantly, the persistent punctate cytoplasmic localization of ApGLNT 1 in association with Buchnera in embryos prior to bacteriocyte formation and later in both embryonic and maternal bacteriomes suggests that ApGLNT 1 plays multiple roles in this symbiosis, roles that include amino acid transport and possibly nutrient sensing...|$|E
40|$|Miscanthus × giganteus is {{a popular}} energy crop, which due to its hybrid origin is only vegetatively reproduced. <b>Asexual</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> in anther and {{microspore}} culture leading to double haploids production could allow to regain the ability for sexual reproduction and to increase the biodiversity of the species. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} paper was to investigate the requirements of androgenesis in Miscanthus. The standard protocols used for monocotyledonous plants were applied with many modifications regarding the developmental stage of the explants at the time of culture initiation, stress treatment applied to panicles and isolated anthers as well as various chemical and physical parameters of in vitro culture conditions. Our results indicated that the induction of androgenesis in M. × giganteus is possible. However, the very low efficiency of the process and the lack of regeneration ability of the androgenic structures presently prevent the use of this technique...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Many insects host their obligate, maternally {{transmitted}} {{symbiotic bacteria}} in specialized cells called bacteriocytes. One of the best-studied insect nutritional endosymbioses {{is that of}} the aphid and its endosymbiont, Buchnera aphidicola. Aphids and Buchnera are metabolically and developmentally integrated, but the molecular mechanisms underlying Buchnera transmission and coordination with aphid development remain largely unknown. Previous work using electron microscopy to study aphid <b>asexual</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> has revealed that Buchnera transmission involves exocytosis from a maternal bacteriocyte followed by endocytotic uptake by a blastula. While the importance of exo- and endocytic cellular processes for symbiont transmission is clear, the molecular mechanisms that regulate these processes are not known. Here, we shed light on the molecular mechanisms that regulate Buchnera transmission and developmental integration. Results We present the developmental atlas of ACYPI 000536 and ACYPI 008904 mRNAs during <b>asexual</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Immediately before Buchnera invasion, transcripts of both genes were detected by whole-mount in situ hybridization in the posterior syncytial nuclei of late blastula embryos. Following Buchnera invasion, expression of both genes was identified in the region occupied by Buchnera throughout embryogenesis. Notably during Buchnera migration, expression of both genes was not concomitant with the entirety of the bacterial mass but rather expression colocalized with Buchnera in the anterior region of the bacterial mass. In addition, we found that ACYPI 000536 was expressed in nuclei at {{the leading edge of the}} bacterial mass, joining the bacterial mass in subsequent developmental stages. Finally, quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR suggested that early in development both transcripts were maternally provisioned to embryos. Conclusions We venture that ACYPI 000536 and ACYPI 008904 function as nutrient sensors at the site of symbiont invasion to facilitate TOR-pathway-mediated endocytosis of Buchnera by the aphid blastula. Our data support earlier reports of bacteriocyte determination involving a two-step recruitment process but suggest that the second wave of recruitment occurs earlier than previously described. Finally, our work highlights that bacteriocyte-enriched amino acid transporter paralogs have additionally been retained to play novel developmental roles in both symbiont recruitment and bacteriome development...|$|E
40|$|Tunicates {{are useful}} models for {{comparing}} differing developmental {{processes such as}} <b>embryogenesis,</b> <b>asexual</b> reproduction, and regeneration, {{because they are the}} closest relatives to vertebrates and are the only chordates to reproduce both sexually and asexually. Among them, the ascidian Botryllus schlosseri forms colonies of numerous individuals embedded in the common tunic, that is the peculiar extracellular matrix (ECM) of tunicates. In B. schlosseri colonies this ECM holds also the colonial circulatory system (CCS) : an anastomized network of vessels defined by simple epithelia and connected to the open circulatory system of the zooids. Recently, we have demonstrated that, during asexual propagation, new vessels form by means of a tubular sprouting mechanism, resembling that occurring in other metazoans, particularly during vertebrate angiogenesis. Moreover the immunohistology of CCS structures using antibodies against vertebrate angiogenic factors (VEGF, FGF- 2, EGF) and receptors (VEGFR- 1, VEGFR- 2, EGFR), have shown that CCS sprouting occurs with their participation (1). In B. schlosseri, the CCS possesses a remarkable regenerative potentiality, as shown by its ability to reform tunic and peripheral vascular network. We have also studied the regeneration of experimentally ablated CCS by analyzing the general dynamics of reorganization of vessels and tunic, their ultrastructure, cell proliferation, and the immunohistology of regenerating structures (2). Results show that the regenerative process of CCS occurs, similarly to normal growth, by the sprouting mechanism, with participation of same angiogenic factors. Statistical analyses on recent experiments are now indicating a significant increase of tunic and vessels regeneration in groups of colonies injected with angiogenic factors (EGF, VEGF) with respect to injected with PBS. This demonstrates that same factors have an angiogenic impact in B. schlosseri and vertebrates circulatory systems. Despite the different embryonic origin of their tissues (the former has an ectodermic origin, the latter mesodermic), all these data indicate that an homologous morphodynamic mechanism, controlled by homologous signal pathways, is involved during normal growth and regeneration of both systems. As a conclusion 1) we can hypothesize that tubular sprouting had a parallel evolution in these two structures, 2) our data support the idea that this morphogenetic mechanism was co-opted during the evolution of various developmental processes in several taxa...|$|R
