50|$|A plate nut, {{also known}} as a <b>nut</b> plate, <b>anchor</b> <b>nut</b> or <b>anchor</b> plate, is a stamped sheet metal nut that is usually riveted to a workpiece. They have a long tube that is {{internally}} threaded and a plate with two clearance holes for rivets. The most popular versions have two lugs and they exist as fixed <b>anchor</b> <b>nuts</b> and as floating <b>anchor</b> <b>nuts.</b> The latter allows the nut to move slightly and so enlarges the positioning tolerances of the mounted parts. They were originally developed for the aerospace industry, but are now also common in automotive racing.These nuts are made up of variety of soft and hard materials. The choice of material depends on environment to which nut is subjected. Soft materials like copper or brass are used when nut is used in electrical application. Hard materials are used when nut is subjected to high stress environment. Sometimes stainless steel or nickel-plated nuts are used in order to increase corrosion resistance.|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} was to evaluate Vespel for potential application on the Solid Rocket Booster to replace all-metal deformed self-locking <b>nuts</b> and <b>anchor</b> <b>nuts</b> and be used as self-locking elements for bolts and screws. The Vespel self-locking elements were tested for prevailing torque retention at room temperature, after heating to 450 F and exposure for 3 hr, breakaway torque at 450 F and for vibration at a level consistent with the maximum expected on the SRB at lift-off and reentry. The investigation revealed Vespel has properties that can provide a self-locking capability for threaded fasteners up to 450 F and it can be used in <b>nuts</b> and <b>anchor</b> <b>nuts</b> for installation on the SRB. Vespel elements in bolts did not meet all our SRB requirements for reuse, however, we have defined a design for Vespel elements in nuts/anchor nuts that fully meets all requirements. It is recommended that No. 1, 1 / 4 in. and 5 / 16 in. nuts/anchor nuts be procured for use on the SRB. This system will eliminate the galling problems now encountered and achieve a much higher reuse life than the present deformed nut design...|$|R
5000|$|An {{insert nut}} {{provides}} a threaded socket for a wooden workpiece, {{similar to a}} wall <b>anchor.</b> Insert <b>nuts</b> are inserted into a pre-drilled hole by one of two means: screw in and hammer in. In both cases, the external protrusions bite into the wood, preventing the nut from either turning or pulling out.|$|R
40|$|Safe {{participation}} in the sport of rock climbing is dependent on using a range of equipment and using appropriate techniques. However, the level of safety achieved {{will depend on the}} specific equipment used, in terms of design, type, adequate load rating and condition, and also upon the climbing technique as this can significantly help to minimise any impact loads in the advent of a fall. In addressing these issues, this paper describes some mechanical tests which have been carried using a specially designed drop load rig in which falling weights have been applied to samples of climbing rope to establish impact loads. The load-time histories have been recorded and peak loads have been compared with those determined theoretically. In addition, some new and also used <b>anchor</b> <b>nuts</b> have been test loaded to failure and the different failure modes which resulted are described. Finally, the general design of climbing equipment is discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|A {{self-aligning}} nut, {{also known}} as a spherical nut or leveling nut, is a type of nut that is used in applications where the fastener is not perpendicular to the surface the <b>nut</b> <b>anchors</b> to. It achieves this action by using a flanged nut inside a specially shaped dished-out washer. They are commonly used in the aerospace industry. If this nut were not used the object would have to be spot faced perpendicular to the fastener.|$|R
40|$|Foundation, {{and method}} for the {{production}} of such a foundation. It is proposed that it be based on prefabricated concrete elements. The elements consist of base elements (2) and end elements (4). Each element is provided with two sockets for receiving pretensioning cables (6), which sockets are situated at a distance from each other, viewed in the vertical direction, and extend over the full length of the element. End elements are provided with further sockets relating to the other direction in which such end elements extend. After the elements have been placed against each other {{in the form of a}} closed curve, the tensioning cables are fitted in the sockets concerned and pretensioning is applied by means of pretensioning <b>anchors</b> comprising pretensioning <b>nuts.</b> Thereafter, the pretensioning anchors are sealed off relative to the environment, and the foundation is ready for use.

40|$|The {{pre-stressing}} concrete {{used for}} casting of section {{is quite different}} from Reinforced cements concrete (RCC.) in concrete Technology. The device mechanism developed for duct forming & anchoring with less losses of pre-stressing value in steel bars of concrete structural element. In modern type of pre-stressing electricity with low voltage and high current is used for a duct forming in concrete member & sulpher coating on steel bars, as duct material. While supplying electricity in the structure, sulpher get melted up because heat generated on the steel bars of the structure. No provision of any duct formation is requiring in concrete structural element. The high strength steel structure could be <b>anchored</b> by tightening <b>nuts</b> at both the ends. The Pre-stressing in concrete structure element is found more effective as compare to the RCC technology. To-day pre-stressing is preferred for many large structural elements like bridge etc. minute modification is required to adopt for all small concrete structure sections also. It is demand to replace RCC completely by pre-stress concrete, because of RCC have large section with less strength as compare to pre-stress concrete. RCC system is rein-forced first, to concrete structural element and then loaded after casting, when ever in the pre-stressing system, where reinforcement which are stressed first then casted & force is applie...|$|R
6000|$|YANK--[With a hard, bitter laugh.] Welcome to your city, huh? Hail, hail, de gang's all here! [At {{the sound}} of his voice the {{chattering}} dies away into an attentive silence. YANK walks up to the gorilla's cage and, leaning over the railing, stares in at its occupant, who stares back at him, silent and motionless. There is a pause of dead stillness. Then YANK begins to talk in a friendly confidential tone, half-mockingly, but with a deep undercurrent of sympathy.] Say, yuh're some hard-lookin' guy, ain't yuh? I seen lots of tough <b>nuts</b> dat de <b>gang</b> called gorillas, but yuh're de foist real one I ever seen. Some chest yuh got, and shoulders, and dem arms and mits! I bet yuh got a punch in eider fist dat'd knock 'em all silly! [This with genuine admiration. The gorilla, as if he understood, stands upright, swelling out his chest and pounding on it with his fist. YANK grins sympathetically.] Sure, I get yuh. Yuh challenge de whole woild, huh? Yuh got what I was sayin' even if yuh muffed de woids. [Then bitterness creeping in.] And why wouldn't yuh get me? Ain't we both members of de same club--de Hairy Apes? [They stare at each other--a pause--then YANK goes on slowly and bitterly.] So yuh're what she seen when she looked at me, de white-faced tart! I was you to her, get me? On'y outa de cage--broke out--free to moider her, see? Sure! Dat's what she tought. She wasn't wise dat I was in a cage, too--worser'n yours--sure--a damn sight--'cause you got some chanct to bust loose--but me--[He grows confused.] Aw, hell! It's all wrong, ain't it? [A pause.] I s'pose yuh wanter know what I'm doin' here, huh? I been warmin' a bench down to de Battery--ever since last night. Sure. I seen de sun come up. Dat was pretty, too--all red and pink and green. I was lookin' at de skyscrapers--steel--and all de ships comin' in, sailin' out, all over de oith--and dey was steel, too. De sun was warm, dey wasn't no clouds, and dere was a breeze blowin'. Sure, it was great stuff. I got it aw right--what Paddy said about dat bein' de right dope--on'y I couldn't get IN it, see? I couldn't belong in dat. It was over my head. And I kept tinkin'--and den I beat it up here to see what youse was like. And I waited till dey was all gone to git yuh alone. Say, how d'yuh feel sittin' in dat pen all de time, havin' to stand for 'em comin' and starin' at yuh--de white-faced, skinny tarts and de boobs what marry 'em--makin' fun of yuh, laughin' at yuh, gittin' scared of yuh--damn 'em! [He pounds on the rail with his fist. The gorilla rattles the bars of his cage and snarls. All the other monkeys set up an angry chattering in the darkness. YANK goes on excitedly.] Sure! Dat's de way it hits me, too. On'y yuh're lucky, see? Yuh don't belong wit 'em and yuh know it. But me, I belong wit 'em--but I don't, see? Dey don't belong wit me, dat's what. Get me? Tinkin' is hard--[He passes one hand across his forehead with a painful gesture. The gorilla growls impatiently. YANK goes on gropingly.] It's dis way, what I'm drivin' at. Youse can sit and dope dream in de past, green woods, de jungle and de rest of it. Den yuh belong and dey don't. Den yuh kin laugh at 'em, see? Yuh're de champ of de woild. But me--I ain't got no past to tink in, nor nothin' dat's comin', on'y what's now--and dat don't belong. Sure, you're de best off! Yuh can't tink, can yuh? Yuh can't talk neider. But I kin make a bluff at talkin' and tinkin'--a'most git away wit it--a'most!--and dat's where de joker comes in. [He laughs.] I ain't on oith and I ain't in heaven, get me? I'm in de middle tryin' to separate 'em, takin' all de woist punches from bot' of 'em. Maybe dat's what dey call hell, huh? But you, yuh're at de bottom. You belong! Sure! Yuh're de on'y one in de woild dat does, yuh lucky stiff! [The gorilla growls proudly.] And dat's why dey gotter put yuh in a cage, see? [The gorilla roars angrily.] Sure! Yuh get me. It beats it when you try to tink it or talk it--it's way down--deep--behind--you 'n' me we feel it. Sure! Bot' members of dis club! [He laughs--then in a savage tone.] What de hell! T' hell wit it! A little action, dat's our meat! Dat belongs! Knock 'em down and keep bustin' 'em till dey croaks yuh wit a gat--wit steel! Sure! Are yuh game? Dey've looked at youse, ain't dey--in a cage? Wanter git even? Wanter wind up like a sport 'stead of croakin' slow in dere? [The gorilla roars an emphatic affirmative. YANK goes on with a sort of furious exaltation.] Sure! Yuh're reg'lar! Yuh'll stick to de finish! Me 'n' you, huh?--bot' members of this club! We'll put up one last star bout dat'll knock 'em offen deir seats! Dey'll have to make de cages stronger after we're trou! [The gorilla is straining at his bars, growling, hopping from one foot to the other. YANK takes a jimmy from under his coat and forces the lock on the cage door. He throws this open.] Pardon from de governor! Step out and shake hands! I'll take yuh for a walk down Fif' Avenoo. We'll knock 'em offen de oith and croak wit de band playin'. Come on, Brother. [The gorilla scrambles gingerly out of his cage. Goes to YANK and stands looking at him. YANK keeps his mocking tone--holds out his hand.] Shake--de secret grip of our order. [Something, the tone of mockery, perhaps, suddenly enrages the animal. With a spring he wraps his huge arms around YANK in a murderous hug. There is a crackling snap of crushed ribs--a gasping cry, still mocking, from YANK.] Hey, I didn't say, kiss me. [The gorilla lets the crushed body slip to the floor; stands over it uncertainly, considering; then picks it up, throws it in the cage, shuts the door, and shuffles off menacingly into the darkness at left. A great uproar of frightened chattering and whimpering comes from the other cages. Then YANK moves, groaning, opening his eyes, and there is silence. He mutters painfully.] Say--dey oughter match him--wit Zybszko. He got me, aw right. I'm trou. Even him didn't tink I belonged. [Then, with sudden passionate despair.] Christ, where do I get off at? Where do I fit in? [Checking himself as suddenly.] Aw, what de hell! No squakin', see! No quittin', get me! Croak wit your boots on! [He grabs hold of the bars of the cage and hauls himself painfully to his feet--looks around him bewilderedly--forces a mocking laugh.] In de cage, huh? [In the strident tones of a circus barker.] Ladies and gents, step forward and take a slant at de one and only--[His voice weakening]--one and original--Hairy Ape from de wilds of--[He slips in a heap on the floor and dies. The monkeys set up a chattering, whimpering wail. And, perhaps, the Hairy Ape at last belongs.] ...|$|R
