40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that Technology Transfer (TT) {{activity}} from the transferees' view point is an important issue when it comes to economic development, especially in developing countries. This present study is concerned with Technology Transfer Strategies and Practices (TTS&P) within/between Nigerian <b>construction</b> <b>organisations,</b> from the transferees' perspective where emphasis is placed more on the indigenous <b>construction</b> <b>organisations.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a framework of TTS&P for Nigerian indigenous <b>construction</b> <b>organisations.</b> This study recognised the importance of collaboration in any Technology Transfer (TT) activities, as Technology Transfer (TT) is a give and take process. Therefore, the study investigated Technology Transfer Strategies and Practices (TTS&P) from both indigenised foreign <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> and indigenous <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> in Nigeria. It investigated the current Technology Transfer Strategies and Practices (TTS&P) employed, the effectiveness of Technology Transfer Strategies and Practices (TTS&P), the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) that influence the implementation of Technology Transfer Strategies and Practices (TTS&P), the benefits and challenges associated with Technology Transfer Strategies and Practices (TTS&P). Evidence from literature revealed the need for TTS&P in Nigerian indigenous <b>construction</b> <b>organisations.</b> It also revealed that there are very few studies on TT that have been undertaken in developing countries, whilst no study has been done on TTS&P, especially in Nigerian <b>construction</b> <b>organisations.</b> The objectives of this empirical study were to explore TTS&P within Nigerian <b>construction</b> <b>organisations.</b> The research adopted an interpretive stance and employs multiple data collection methods. It employed a combination of both postal questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. A total of 143 completed questionnaires representing 108 questionnaires from indigenous <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> and 35 questionnaires from indigenised foreign <b>construction</b> <b>organisations,</b> formed the data base for the quantitative analysis. The qualitative data were from 23 semi-structured interviews (9 interviews came from indigenised foreign <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> and 14 interviews from indigenous <b>construction</b> <b>organisations).</b> The study concluded that organisational alliance through technology transfers are growing and the potential benefits of such organisational arrangements are not being realised because participating organisations are emphasising on short-term profit sharing to the detriment of more long-term and ultimately, core value-added, dimensions of knowledge creation and organisational learning. The study therefore recommended a long-term collaboration that would embrace technology transfer strategies and practices which would encourage <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> to move away from their traditional client-contractors relationships to more contractorscontractors- clients relationship for more knowledge, skills and techniques sharing processes. This study was limited to Nigerian <b>construction</b> <b>organisations,</b> especially the indigenous <b>construction</b> <b>organisations,</b> but can be generalised and thus applied to other organisations that exhibit similar characteristics...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Emerging {{information}} and communication technology (ICT) introduces opportunities for improving communication to enhance effectiveness of many construction processes at each project phase as well as creating new business opportunities. Thus, perceived ICT benefits have motivated numerous <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> to adopt and invest in this technology. However, many <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> {{have found that the}} ICT investment has failed to meet their expectations. One significant problem is a lack of understanding of how to actually implement ICT into a <b>construction</b> <b>organisation.</b> This may lead to ICT implementation failure or retardation by all users within a <b>construction</b> <b>organisation.</b> In addition, a lack of focus on actual ICT implementation may explain why ICT implementation problems still occur. Before substantial progress can be made to remedy deficiencies in ICT implementation, a better understanding is needed about the context and influence of a range of workplace, organisational and personal factors on ICT implementation.

The general focus of this paper is directed upon ICT implementation in <b>construction</b> <b>organisations,</b> with a specific focus using results from a study of a small but indicative sample of Australian ICT literate <b>construction</b> <b>organisations.</b> An improved understanding of ICT implementation can be achieved through a general survey of the literature and then testing theory developed from the literature using a representative pool of general <b>construction</b> <b>organisation.</b> Alternatively, a narrow focus could be directed at organisations that are already well experienced in the use of ICT. The authors concentrated upon Australian <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> with over a decade of experience in ICT implementation so that salient lessons learned could be more readily available for dissemination more widely. This paper attempts to fill ICT implementation gaps by focusing on ICT diffusion at the actual implementation stage.

40|$|Abstract: Research {{about the}} {{implementation}} of health and safety (H&S) {{in the construction industry}} is required, as it may create more awareness on strategies to significantly reduce the rate of incidents and fatalities in <b>construction</b> <b>organisations.</b> It may encourage such organisations to improve their H&S performances on construction projects. The aim of this research is to establish the drivers of H&S implementation in <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> within the Gauteng Province in South Africa. The research adopted a quantitative research methodology. A survey questionnaire was used to collect primary data. Judgemental and snowball sampling techniques were employed to select the respondents consisting of site engineers, site agents, contracts managers, construction managers and project managers. Data were analysed through descriptive statistics, mean item score and standard deviation. Findings indicated that the most important drivers are the need to manage hazards; organisations regard H&S as important; compliance with the legislation; consideration of H&S as a way to do business and to reduce costs associated with accidents and injuries. These results may assist <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> in setting H&S as a priority, since little {{attention has been paid to}} the objective of H&S implementation. This study was restricted to large <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> within the Gauteng Province in South Africa and therefore may not be generalizable to all <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> within South Africa and in other geographical locations...|$|R

Relevant {{problems}} related {{to the adoption of}} unprogrammed solutions in the process of managing the production  activity of a construction enterprise in unstable, a priori  underdetermined economic environments are addressed. The aim of  the study is todevelop tools and methods for assessing the  effectiveness of the current state of construction production and on  this basis to identify the most effective management of a  <b>construction</b> <b>organisation</b> under unstable market conditions. Methods. The methodology of the conducted research is based on the application of the mathematical apparatus of fuzzy sets for the  processing of expert data and the formation on this basis of linguistic functions that determine the analytical relationship between various  indicators of the production activity of the <b>construction</b> <b>organisation.</b> Results. A method is developed for processing expert data using  fuzzy logic, making it possible to form an analytical relationship  between the performance indicators of the production activity of the  <b>construction</b> <b>organisation</b> and the management parameters that  determine its current state. An alternative means for selecting the  most effective management approach, accounting for its influence on the efficiency of the production activity of the construction organisation, is developed. Conclusion. An information-economic model of situational management of the development of a <b>construction</b> <b>organisation</b> is  developed. The proposed tools and methods allow the effective  management of the production activity of the construction  organisation to be organised, and on this basis to increase the  efficiency of production under different economic conditions in the presence of spontaneously arising perturbative factors.

Methods. As a methodological basis for the study, principles of situational management of complex socio-economic systems and  means of calculating the efficiency of production potential loading of  <b>construction</b> <b>organisation</b> are employed {{on the basis of the}} ratio of  production activity financial results to the costs of input factors introduced into the production process. Results. The necessity for managing the production potential of the <b>construction</b> <b>organisation</b> and its goals are substantiated. The rules  are systematised, allowing organisational-economic and  organisational- technical management measures to be promptly  identified on a situational basis, these being the most effective in the current economic situation SE to eliminate the differences between  the situations ST and SC. The set of such inference rules for each element of the production potential of the construction organisation  ai, i = 1, 2, [...] ., 5 will determine the situational model for managing  the production potential of the <b>construction</b> <b>organisation</b> in various  situations SjE, the economic environment for which the actual or  desired model of the state of its production potential form a  reference.

40|$|The {{project-based}} {{nature of}} <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> creates a learning opportunity {{from most of}} the activities carried by these organisations. Knowledge is being created in the course of carrying core and non-core activities in the organisation. For organisations {{to make the most of}} this knowledge, a mechanism for tapping has to exist. Such tapping can occur through the organisation’s various activities and organisations stand to benefit if these activities are done strategically not only to tap, but also to create and transfer knowledge and ultimately enhance performance. The study has henceforth analysed the knowledge transfer process of <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> in the Tanzania construction industry and explored how these organisations facilitate creation and transfer of knowledge. A survey in a pilot study in the year 2001 was conducted to refine and focus the study’s questions and propositions and a case study strategy of inquiry has been adopted for the main study. Four <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> in the Tanzania construction industry are studied. The analyses from findings support the propositions set forth in the study and among others establish: the specificity of the knowledge transfer process in <b>construction</b> <b>organisations,</b> the situational nature of the knowledge being transferred, the ephemeral nature of goals and the “selling of jobs” in construction sites influencing incentives for knowledge management initiatives. The study further establishes that there are inadequate attributes towards knowledge creation in the organisations. That: there is limited practice of on-the-job training, peer assist and learning by imitation; codification of procedures, rules, and checklists is done insignificantly or absent completely; networking of knowledge is poor; experience sharing and learning by doing is low. In effect the study proposes an optimal knowledge transfer process for <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> in Tanzania using an IDEF 0 business process model, and explores the cost-effectiveness for organisations in the industry pursuing knowledge management initiatives such as the knowledge transfer process.

40|$|Technology {{transfer}} is increasingly {{being seen as}} an important issue for economic development and growth. Arguably, this is why developed and especially developing countries are very keen on technology transfer. However, there are those that contend that organisations in the Nigerian construction industry are not as engaged in technology transfer as many would like, and that potential benefits of doing so are not realized. In the same vein, the challenges that confront <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> in Nigeria in terms of technology transfer have received very little empirical studies. This paper, therefore, presents a thorough review of literature on strategic issues and choices that Nigerian <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> face in grappling with technology transfer, together with associated challenges. Consideration is also given to what technology transfer actually means to such organisations, and how this is viewed in line with other terms such as innovation. The paper argues and concludes that the challenges that confront <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> in Nigeria are multifaceted and likely to impact on their strategic choices. In the same vein, it is also argued that these have implications for researchers attempting to investigate technology transfer practices and strategies in <b>construction</b> <b>organisations</b> in Nigeria {{in terms of their}} choice of research strategy and design...|$|R
