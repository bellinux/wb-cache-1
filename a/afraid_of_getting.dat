25|$|Sexual {{abstinence}} is {{the practice}} of refraining from some or all aspects of sexual activity for medical, psychological, legal, social, financial, philosophical, moral or religious reasons. For the last twenty years, abstinence rates among American adolescents have risen. The percentage {{of high school students}} in the US who reported that they have ever had sexual intercourse dropped from 54.1% in 1991 to 47.8% in 2007 and to 43% in 2011. A cross-sectional survey in 1998 found that fear of pregnancy was the most commonly cited reason for choosing abstinence, especially among girls, as well as boys who had caused a pregnancy in the past. Other reasons included a fear of sexually transmitted infections, a lack of desire, being <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> caught, and the belief that sex was not appropriate for someone of their age.|$|E
25|$|Śrībhārgavāvatāropakramaḥ (Sanskrit: श्रीभार्गवावतारोपक्रमः). The poet {{invokes the}} blessings of the goddess of {{learning}} Sarasvatī, Gaṇeśa, Śiva's consort Pārvatī, Śiva, Sītā and Rāma, and finally the two Rāmas, {{the subject of the}} narrative. Bhṛgu, the seventh son of the creator-god Brahmā, and his wife Khyāti beget a son named Ṛcīka in the seventh Manvantara. Ṛcīka marries Satyavatī, the daughter of the Kṣatriya king Gādhi. Ṛcīka prepares two bowls of Pāyasa for Satyavatī and her mother, with Brāhmaṇa and Kṣatriya qualities, respectively. Satyavatī's mother stealthily exchanges the bowls to get a son with Brāhmaṇa qualities (this son would later become Viśvāmitra). On knowing her mother's act, Satyavatī beseeches Ṛcīka to transfer the Kṣatriya qualities to her grandson, as she is <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> a fierce or violent son. Ṛcīka obliges her and the couple get a son named Jamadagni. Jamadagni marries Reṇukā, the daughter of the sage Reṇu. The couple have three sons. For the fourth son, the couple performs penance to please Rāma. Meanwhile, a son named Arjuna is born to the Haihaya king Kṛtavīrya. Arjuna obtains the boon of a thousand arms from Dattātreya, he is subsequently known as Sahasrārjuna ("thousand-Arjuna"). Sahasrārjuna terrorizes the whole world – he stops the flow of the river Narmadā, defeats and incarcerates the demon-king Rāvaṇa (who is later released on the request of Pulastya), and takes over the Svarga ("heaven") and the offerings of the Yajña ("fire sacrifice") from the Devatās ("gods"). The distressed Devatas go to Sāketaloka with Brahmā and pray to Rāma. Rāma tells the Devatās that his Aṃśa will incarnate as the fourth son of Jamadagni and Reṇukā to slay Sahasrārjuna. This Aṃśa would annihilate despotic Kṣatriya races, offer all lands to the sage Kaśyapa, and would finally reenter him in Mithilā. The Devatās go back convinced and Reṇukā becomes pregnant with Rāma entering her womb.|$|E

Halfpenny told Inside Soap that Amy goes off the rails {{because she is}} convinced everything goes wrong in her life. [...] "She's <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> hurt, so she spoils things for herself before anyone else can get there first." [...] Halfpenny explained that Val's parental approach compared to Eric's was contrasting. Eric had not been around when his son David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) grew up, Halfpenny said this factor meant that Eric is not tolerant with Amy's bad behaviour. Though, Val had brought up her own children, her approach towards Amy is [...] "light-hearted." [...] However, when Amy continues her alcohol binges, Val and Eric feel she has [...] "gone too far" [...] and [...] "question their {{ability to cope with}} her." [...] Served with an ultimatum, Amy has to endure changes to remain with her new family. Halfpenny claimed the main change she had to make was [...] "to keep her tongue in her own mouth and cool it down with the boys." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{developing}} {{the characteristics of}} their version of Lois Lane, the writers took inspiration from other leading ladies in cinema, for example, Karen Allen's character Marion Ravenwood, from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Todd Slavkin describes the character as having a [...] "sophisticated, worldly experience", and {{was considered to be}} more of an adult {{than the rest of the}} cast. Durance believes that she embodies many of the characteristics that the creative team wanted to show in their version of Lois, specifically the fact that Lois has a lot of [...] "nervous energy" [...] from trying to [...] "find herself", the same nervous energy that Durance brings to the role. The actress also relates to Lois's sassy, and independent nature, but, conversely, she is not as extroverted as Lois. Gough describes the character as coming from the school of hard knocks; she is street smart, and a very capable woman. Durance believes her character is [...] "fiercely independent", but at the same time she is not afraid to admit that she has flaws, and she is only human; Lois also does not feel sorry about having those flaws. She goes into further detail, identifying the character as more of a tomboy who is vulnerable, with Gough adding that she is also [...] "slightly neurotic". BuddyTV's John Kubicek characterizes her as a fast-talking woman, who, though she whines over petty annoyances, can take care of herself. He goes on to further describe how she is not <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> herself into trouble just so she can dig herself out.|$|E

In September 1995, he got international recognition, taking seven wickets for the PCB Patron's Eleven against the visiting Sri Lankans.

[...] In June Juanico's book Elvis in the Twilight of Memory, she stated she was <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> pregnant.

2500|$|Boys {{who caused}} a {{pregnancy}} {{in the past}} were {{more than twice as}} likely to become abstinent after this episode than boys who had not. However, for girls, a past pregnancy had little correlation with secondary abstinence. Fear of pregnancy, wanting to wait until marriage, and not wanting to have sex were cited more often by virgins in the 12th grade than they were by 9th graders. [...] Of the sexually experienced who are now practicing abstinence, girls were more likely than boys to say a lack of desire, fear of STDs, being <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> caught, the belief that sex was not appropriate for someone their age, and that their parents had taught them the advantages of waiting as reasons why they made their decision.|$|E

The album was widely {{addressed}} a personal album, speaking {{about what it}} is like to be [...] "a girl like me"—things that girls Rihanna's age at the time were going through—as well as every aspect of her life: people being cheated on, falling in and out of love, people hating on you, having feelings towards a guy and partying. [...] "SOS" [...] tells about a guy who gives the girl a feeling that is very overwhelming—he drives the girl crazy, and she needs someone to rescue her from it. [...] "Kisses Don't Lie" [...] talks about a girl who's in love with a guy but is stuck between an ultimatum because she's <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> hurt. [...] "Unfaithful" [...] documents the decay of a relationship when another person starts cheating. According to Rihanna, [...] "I'm referred to as a murderer in that song, meaning I'm taking this guy's life by hurting him, cheating on him. He knows, and it makes him feel so bad. It's killing him to know that another guy is making me happy." [...] "We Ride" [...] talks about how a guy promises a girl that they will be together forever, while the girl describes moments which he did things that could tear them apart. The lyrics of [...] "Dem Haters" [...] portray a message about how [...] "haters" [...] try to bring people down and recommends excluding them from your life. [...] "Final Goodbye" [...] talks about a woman who wants to spend the rest of her life with a man but feels that she needs to reveal a secret before moving on. [...] "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" [...] continues the theme of love in a similar vein to [...] "SOS", however, [...] "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" [...] portrays a message about being in love, whereas [...] "SOS" [...] talks about having an overwhelming feeling towards a guy.|$|E

A patient might feel dread so strongly because of autophobia that they may hyperventilate and feel like they may die because of it. It is also noted that patients with hyperventilation and death anxiety might also develop or have autophobia because they are so <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> dying, <b>getting</b> seriously injured, or otherwise find themselves in a dire situation, that they become deathly <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> being alone. Without somebody to help them in case they need it, autophobia-induced anxiety may occur along with other anxieties or phobias included in the agoraphobic cluster.|$|R
