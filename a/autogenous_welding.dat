5000|$|Lead burning is an <b>autogenous</b> <b>welding</b> process. Two {{sheets of}} lead are formed {{mechanically}} to lie close against each other. They are then heated with the torch flame and flow together. No filler rod is required, the sheets {{form their own}} filler (<b>autogenous</b> <b>welding).</b> Neither is a flux used. Soldering, by contrast, uses a solder alloy that is some compatible alloy showing eutectic behaviour. This gives a melting point lower than the base metal, allowing a soldering process rather than welding. A filler rod may be needed for some welds, {{if there is no}} convenient way to form sufficient close overlap at a sheet edge. Offcuts of the same lead sheet are used as this filler. Excessive use of a filler, rather than an initial close fit, is considered a sign of poor technique.|$|E
5000|$|Not all welding {{processes}} require filler metal. <b>Autogenous</b> <b>welding</b> processes only require {{part of the}} existing base metal to be melted and this is sufficient, provided that the joint is already mechanically close-fitting before welding. Forge- or hammer welding uses hammering to close up the hot joint and also to locally increase its heat.|$|E
50|$|In 1898, the {{acetylene}} factory, Augsburg {{was founded}} by Johann Josef Keller and Jakob Knappich {{for the production of}} low-cost domestic and municipal lighting, household appliances and automobile headlights. In 1905, the production was extended to the innovative <b>autogenous</b> <b>welding</b> equipments. After the First World War, Keller and Knappich resumed production of safety-, manual- and power-winches and began the manufacturing of large vessels. As a result, the Bayerische Kesselwagen GmbH was formed in 1922. The Bayerische Kesselwagen GmbH was responsible for the development and production of superstructures for municipal vehicles (street cleaning machines, sewage trucks, garbage trucks). In 1927, this business division presented the first large garbage truck. The name KUKA came into being in the same year through the company’s name at that time “Keller und Knappich Augsburg”.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{advanced}} manufacturing technologies is laser welding. Due to the limited power of the beam, the difficulty of precise preparation of the joint {{and the possibility of}} hardening in a narrow heat affected zone laser welding is used only for basic low carbon and low alloy steels.

50|$|These {{limitations}} {{are the reasons}} why large high crown panels such as wings and fenders are often made in many pieces. The pieces are then welded together usually with one of two processes. TIG welding (Tungsten Inert Gas) produces less heat distortion, but produces a harder, more brittle weld that may cause problems when planishing/smoothing by hand, or in the wheeling machine. Oxy-acetylene welding joints don't have this drawback, provided {{they are allowed to}} cool to room temperature in air, but do produce more heat distortion. Panel joints may be achieved using <b>autogenous</b> <b>welding</b> - that is welding without filler rod (Oxy-acetylene or TIG processes), this is useful when finally smoothing the welding joints as it reduces the amount filing/grinding/linishing needed or almost eliminates it altogether. It also, more importantly, reduces heat distortion of the surface contour, which must be corrected on the wheel or with hammer and dolly.|$|E
50|$|As {{copper and}} nickel alloy {{with each other}} easily and have simple structures, the alloys are ductile and readily fabricated. Strength and {{hardness}} for each individual alloy is increased by cold working; they are not hardened by heat treatment. Joining of 90-10 (C70600) and 70-30 (C71500) is possible by both welding or brazing. They are both weldable {{by the majority of}} techniques, although <b>autogenous</b> (<b>welding</b> without weld consumables) or oxyacetylene methods are not recommended. The 70-30 rather than 90-10 weld consumables are normally preferred for both alloys and no after-welding heat treatment is required. They can also be welded directly to steel, providing a 65% nickel-copper weld consumable is used to avoid iron dilution effects. The C71640 alloy tends to be used as seamless tubing and expanded rather than welded into the tube plate. Brazing requires appropriate silver-base brazing alloys. However, great care must be taken to ensure that there are no stresses in the Cu-Ni being silver brazed, since any stress can cause intergranulary penetration of the brazing material, and severe stress cracking (see image). Thus, full annealing of any potential mechanical stress is necessary.|$|E

30|$|The {{failure of}} the <b>autogenous</b> <b>weld</b> joint was located at the weld centre {{regardless}} of the test temperature, recorded the lowest hardness in the weld joint (refer to Fig.  7). In single pass <b>autogenous</b> <b>weld,</b> the weld metal solidifies as coarse columnar grains by epitaxial growth towards the weld centre with preferential orientation, which {{may result in a}} weak centre line in the weld (Villafuerte and Kerr 1990). The higher tensile strength of filler-added joint than the autogenous joint at all test temperatures is attributed to the fine Nb- and Mo-rich carbides. In turn, B retained in the austenitic matrix without precipitation of detrimental carboborides in the WM of filler-added joint. The retention of elemental B in the WM increases the hardenability and thereby resulted in increased strength of the filler-added joint. The reduction in the strength values of weld joints with increase in test temperature is attributed to the accelerated recovery process (Choudhary and Rao Palaparti 2012).|$|R
50|$|The {{weld pool}} must be carried along the joint in a {{consistent}} width and depth, and the motion {{used to carry}} the weld pool has a direct effect {{on the quality of}} the weld bead.

30|$|The mode of {{solidification}} in {{stainless steels}} is strongly {{dependent on the}} chemical composition which is usually represented as Cr and Ni equivalents (Valiente Bermejo 2012; Brooks et al. 1983).

The Cr and Ni equivalent of <b>autogenous</b> <b>weld</b> metal is determined as 18.2 and 14.7  %, respectively. Similarly, the Cr and Ni equivalent for filler-added weld metal is determined as 19.4 and 23.1  %.

40|$|Abstract. Growing {{demand to}} reduce fuel {{consumption}} has accelerated {{the application of}} Al sheets to the body structure of automobiles. While recent studies on laser welding of Al 5 xxx series and Al 6 xxx series alloys have examined weldability, the laser <b>autogenous</b> <b>welding</b> usually results in low gap bridging capability and weld defects such as porosity, underfill, cracking, and so on. In this study, we evaluated the gap bridging capability and the crack sensitivity during laser <b>autogenous</b> <b>welding,</b> laser welding with filler wire, and laser-arc hybrid welding, respectively. Al 5 J 32 and 6 K 21 sheets were used as the base metal and Al 4 xxx series and Al 5 xxx series wires were used as the filler metal. Employing adequate welding conditions, the gap bridging capability during butt welding was investigated for each welding process. To clarify the solidification crack sensitivity, bead-on-plate welding was implemented for a tapered specimen as a self-restraint crack test. Compared with the laser <b>autogenous</b> <b>welding,</b> laser welding with filler wire and the laser-arc hybrid welding showed improved gap bridging capability and reduced crack sensitivity...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: Influence of basic parameters of laser welding on shape {{and quality of the}} butt joints and the range of optimal parameters of welding were determined. Findings: It was showed that there is a wide range of laser <b>autogenous</b> <b>welding</b> parameters which ensures high quality joints of mechanical strength not lower than the strength of the base material (BM). The butt joints of austenitic steel AISI 321 sheets welded by the HPDL diode laser at optimal parameters are very high quality, without any internal imperfections and the structure and grain size of weld metal and HAZ is very small and also the HAZ is very narrow and the fusion zone is very regular.

To meet this requirement, different procedures used in antiquity were reproduced by means of experimental archaeology. These models correspond to three metal-joining methods reported by ancient recipes: solid-state diffusion with copper salt, brazing and <b>autogenous</b> <b>welding.</b> These techniques were studied by different analytical methods in order to characterize them at both compositional and microstructural level (SEM-EDS, metallography, μ-XRF and μ-PIXE). The results obtained show that the solid-state diffusion bonding with copper salt presents a crystal hexagonal structure without phase changes in the joining point, where only a variation in the grain size is observed. At the compositional level, this soldering method is characterized by a local increase in copper concentration and a small decrease in gold content. In contrast, brazing shows a dendritic-porous structure due to the superposition of the soldering alloy and the crystal structure of the original foils. Besides, the compositional analysis revealed an increment of silver and copper concentrations and a simultaneous reduction of gold concentration.

30|$|The <b>autogenous</b> <b>weld</b> of Super 304 H first solidifies as δ ferrite {{near the}} fusion line {{due to the}} {{peritectic}} solidification, followed by eutectic single austenite solidification phase evident from the cellular structure of austenite in the weld centre. The austenite continues to grow into the peritectic δ ferrite by solid state transformation, with austenite as the more stable phase. Metalographically hard to distinguish peritectic and eutectic ferrite was retained in the intercellular austenitic/austenitic and austenitic/δ-ferrite boundaries of the <b>autogenous</b> <b>weld</b> (refer to Fig.  2 b), as the solid state transformation of δ ferrite to austenite is not complete due to segregation or cooling conditions (Brooks et al. 1983). The addition of B to stainless steel enhances the hardenability and creep strength, however the B in solid solution is beneficial and precipitated borides are detrimental. The segregation of Fe, Cr, B and C (refer to Fig.  4 f) in the intercellular region of the austenite reveals the presence of (Fe,Cr) 23 (C,B) 6 borocarbides (Hoffman and ASM 1989; Karlsson et al. 1982). The limited solubility of B in austenitic stainless steel of 30 PPM at 900  °C may cause the excess B to segregate along the grain boundaries and combine with Cr and Fe to form a low melting eutectic with the austenite (Carinci 1994). Such eutectic formation and borocarbide precipitation within the ferrite stringers alter {{the composition of the}} solidifying liquid ahead of the austenite/liquid interface and hinder the liquid to solidify as austenite in the intercellular boundaries.|$|R

[EN]: This manuscript collects {{the results}} obtained in the investigation carried out during the PhD studies about the non-destructive characterization of archaeological gold jewelry, developed mainly within the investigation project: Riqueza, valor y precio: el metal como referente en las sociedades mediterraneas (s. V a. C. - I d. C.), supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation. Gold and gold artifacts are excellent objects for unraveling the secret of ancient times and its society from their ambivalent character as condensed wealth and that basis of power, but also as transcendental symbols of eternal life and beauty, also considering {{that the work of}} gold {{was one of the first}} metallurgical techniques performed by man. This work arises in response to the need to understand and study the production techniques of pre-romans jewelries, starting from the systematic characterization of the different soldering methods used in the antiquity to produce these objects. To reach this aim, a portable device of X-rays fluorescence was designed and developed. This system allows to analyze in situ micrometric details of the archaeological jewelry by means of a micro-beam, for example, the soldering area of antiquity jewelries. The results obtained have demonstrated that using a focalization optics device, provides a high flux density of X-rays in the sample and a lateral resolution of 30 µm. The sensibility and the detection limits of this device allow to analyze the majority, minority and trace elements. In a second stage, before moving to the archaeological jewelry studies, models of the production processes used in the antiquity, by means of the experimental archaeology were performed. These models reproduce the three soldering/welding methods, reported by an ancient recipe: solid state diffusion bonding with copper salt, brazing and <b>autogenous</b> <b>welding.</b> The three techniques have been studiedby different methods (SEM-EDS, metallography, micro-XRF and micro-PIXE). The results obtained show that the solid state diffusion bonding with copper salt presents a crystal hexagonal structure without phase changes in the joining point, where only a variation in the dimensions of the crystal grains is observed. At the compositional level, this kind of alloy is characterized by an increase in the copper composition and a small decrease of gold content. The brazing shows a dendritic-porous structure, due to the superposition of the soldering alloy on the crystal structure of the sheet alloy. In the compositional analysis of the brazing an increment of the silver and copper concentration and simultaneous decrease of gold concentration is observed. Finally, in the <b>autogenous</b> <b>welding</b> no changes in micro-structural and compositional level are observed. The results obtained were utilized, in the third stage of this work, to study and characterize the ancient jewelry using the micro-XRF system. Several objects representative of two coetaneous cultures from the Mediterranean Basin, Tartesic and Etruscan, were analyzed. Tartesic were a civilization located in the South-West of the Iberian Peninsula, from the Bronze Age to the 4 th century B. C. The studied objects are a group of pieces belonging to the El Carambolo treasure, which is the most representative example of Tartesic jewelry. The results obtained have showed a good homogeneity in the alloys composition and the use of <b>autogenous</b> <b>welding</b> and brazing as joining method. Besides, some similarities and differences in the production processes have been observed, which supports the hypothesis that these objects were produced in the same workshop, where there was a collaboration between different goldsmiths using different techniques.

The samples were subjected to tensile testing after an aging {{post weld heat treatment}} was performed at 480 ºC for 3 hours. Acceptable results were obtained although some concerns emerged regarding the ability of the welding jig to ensure repeatability of joint fit-up and alignment of the laser beam with respect to the seam. Alternative techniques such as dual focus (twin spot), scanner welding, addition of filler material and pulsed Nd:YAG welding were investigated to increase the operating window compared to autogenous single spot laser welding by making the process less sensitive to fit up and alignment. Metallurgical investigations were also performed to compare the microstructures produced by the various welding techniques. Twin spot and pulsed Nd:YAG welding increased the tolerance with regards to laser beam offset to 0. 5 mm compared to 0. 2 mm for single spot <b>autogenous</b> <b>welding.</b> The higher heat input of twin spot resulted in a higher fraction of reverted austenite after PWHT at 480 ºC for 3 h and reduced mechanical properties compared to pulsed Nd:YAG welding.

40|$|Type 441 {{stainless}} steel (EN 1. 4509 or UNS S 43940) {{is a low}} carbon dual-stabilised ferritic grade with a nominal chromium content of 18 %. This steel displays high corrosion and oxidation resistance, good formability, excellent high temperature strength and thermal fatigue resistance. Type 441 {{stainless steel}} is used primarily in high temperature applications such as the automotive exhaust systems. The ferritic grades of stainless steel are difficult to weld successfully, especially in thicker sections, and for applications involving welding, the recommended plate thickness is limited to 2. 5 mm for type 441. This investigation studied the weldability of type 441 stainless steel in thicker sections, with specific emphasis on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the weld metal and heat-affected zone after {{gas tungsten arc welding}} and laser beam welding at various heat input levels. The precipitation of intermetallic compounds (such as Laves and sigma phase) during the weld thermal cycle, carbide precipitation and grain growth in the weld metal and high temperature heat-affected zone were considered. The results indicate that the microstructures of the weld and heat-affected zone that form during <b>autogenous</b> <b>welding</b> of type 441 stainless steel are complex and strongly dependent on the cooling rate after welding (and therefore the weld heat input used). Laves phase, sigma phase, M 23 C 6 carbides and needle-like titanium-rich carbides (with niobium in solid solution) were observed in the welds and heat-affected zones of gas tungsten arc welds. The presence of intermetallic compounds and carbides embrittled the weld metal and increased the hardness of the weld metal significantly. The fusion zones of the laser welds were observed to be mostly free of second phase particles, whereas the heat-affected zone contained partially dissolved cuboidal titanium-rich carbides and some M 23 C 6 carbides (in the higher heat input welds). The laser welds displayed significantly higher strength and ductility, which {{can be attributed to the}} lower heat inputs utilised and the finer grain sizes obtained. Although type 441 is dual-stabilized with titanium and niobium, welding at low heat input levels resulted in chromium-rich M 23 C 6 precipitation in the high temperature heataffected zone during cooling, effectively sensitising the welds to intergranular corrosion. Sensitisation in gas tungsten arc welds was limited to a narrow region of the HTHAZ adjacent to the fusion line in low heat input welds, but extended well into the HTHAZ and weld metal at heat inputs of 0. 3 kJ/mm and 0. 45 kJ/mm. Sensitisation was mostly suppressed in samples welded at a heat input of 0. 7 kJ/mm. Sensitisation was observed in the weld metal of laser welds performed at 0. 11 kJ/mm, and in the weld and HTHAZ after welding at 0. 23 kJ/mm.

40|$|Nitrogen-alloyed {{austenitic}} stainless steels are becoming increasingly popular, mainly due to their excellent combination of strength and toughness. Nitrogen desorption to the atmosphere during the <b>autogenous</b> <b>welding</b> of these steels is often a major problem, resulting in porosity and nitrogen losses from the weld. In order to counteract this problem, the addition of nitrogen to the shielding gas has been proposed. This study deals with the absorption and desorption of nitrogen during the autogenous arc welding {{of a number of}} experimental stainless steels. These steels are similar in composition to type 310 stainless steel, but with varying levels of nitrogen and sulphur. The project investigated the influence of the base metal nitrogen content, the nitrogen partial pressure in the shielding gas and the weld surface active element concentration on the nitrogen content of autogenous welds. The results confirm that Sievert's law is not obeyed during welding. The weld nitrogen content increases with an increase in the shielding gas nitrogen content at low nitrogen partial pressures, but at higher partial pressures a dynamic equilibrium is created where the amount of nitrogen absorbed by the weld metal is balanced by the amount of nitrogen evolved from the weld pool. In alloys with low sulphur contents, this steady-state nitrogen content is not influenced to any significant extent by the base metal nitrogen content, but in high sulphur alloys, an increase in the initial nitrogen concentration results in higher weld nitrogen contents over the entire range of nitrogen partial pressures evaluated. A kinetic model can be used to describe nitrogen absorption and desorption during welding. The nitrogen desorption rate constant decreases with an increase in the sulphur concentration. This is consistent with a site blockage model, where surface active elements occupy a fraction of the available surface sites. The absorption rate constant is, however, not a strong function of the surface active element concentration. Alloys with higher base metal nitrogen contents require increased levels of supersaturation prior to the onset of nitrogen evolution as bubbles. These increased levels of supersaturation for the higher-nitrogen alloys is probably related to the higher rate of nitrogen removal as N 2 the onset of bubble formation. Given that nitrogen bubble formation and detachment require nucleation and growth, it is assumed that a higher nitrogen removal rate would require a higher degree of supersaturation. Nitrogen losses from nitrogen-alloyed stainless steels can be expected during welding in pure argon shielding gas. Small amounts of nitrogen can be added to the shielding gas to counteract this effect, but this should be done with care to avoid bubble formation. Supersaturation before bubble formation does, however, extend the range of shielding gas compositions which can be used. Due to the lower desorption rates associated with higher surface active element concentrations, these elements have a beneficial influence during the welding of high nitrogen stainless steels. Although higher sulphur contents may not be viable in practice, small amounts of oxygen added to the shielding gas during welding will have a similar effect.

40|$|Beryllium is an {{interesting}} metal that has a strength to weight ratio six times that of steel. Because of its unique mechanical properties, beryllium is used in aerospace applications such as satellites. In addition, beryllium is also used in x-ray windows because it is nearly transparent to x-rays. Joining of beryllium has been studied for decades (Ref. l). Typically joining processes include braze-welding (either with gas tungsten arc or gas metal arc), soldering, brazing, and electron beam welding. Cracking which resulted from electron beam welding was recently studied to provide structure/property relationships in <b>autogenous</b> <b>welds</b> (Ref. 2). Braze-welding utilizes a welding arc to melt filler, and {{only a small amount}} of base metal is melted and incorporated into the weld pool. Very little has been done to characterize the braze-weld in terms of the structure/property relationships, especially with reference to multipass welding. Thus, this investigation was undertaken to evaluate the effects of multiple passes on microstructure, weld metal composition, and resulting material properties for beryllium welded with aluminum-silicon filler metal...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This work {{considers}} {{the use of}} Holographic Optical Elements (HOEs) to shape the weld beam and control the microstructure of the weld bead. The beam profiles investigated are a standard Gaussian and an Offset Rugby Post produced by a HOE. <b>Autogenous</b> <b>welds</b> have been produced on plain carbon steel {{with the introduction of}} a nickel alloy filler powder, using different energy densities. Cross sections of the welds have been analysed in terms of the weld profile, weld pool shape, HAZ and the extent of the deposit/substrate mixing. Electron BackScatter Diffraction (EBSD) coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) has been used to study the microstructures developed. The results have shown that by utilising HOE’s the weld pool shape can be modified so that a squarer profile can be obtained. The grain structure within the weld pool can be controlled such that a finer more equiaxed grain structure can be developed when compared with the coarse columnar grains seen with a Gaussian beam with a marked difference in the microstructures in the HAZ...|$|R
40|$|The {{autogenous}} friction welded- titanium alloys, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and Ti- 6 Al- 2 Sn- 4 Zr- 6 Mo, {{were studied}} during this Ph. D. degree.
