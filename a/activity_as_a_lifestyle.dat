40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityOverweight {{and obesity}} {{contribute}} {{to the risk of}} heart disease, diabetes, and other serious chronic health problems. Among adults, married and cohabiting people represent the majority of the overweight and obese people in the United States. Modest weight loss of 5 - 10 % of body weight contributes to a reduction of health risk factors. Nurse practitioners, traditionally health educators, may help their patients to appreciate the value of weight loss by using a couple-centered approach to facilitate behavioral adjustments that incorporate dietary changes and physical <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> toward improving overall health...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of rising chronic {{diseases}} amongst Indigenous peoples, there are calls for the adoption of more healthy "lifestyles. " In this context, this paper explores thoughts about physical activity from 21 Indigenous families through the voices of women and girls living in remote rural communities in the Torres Strait and Northern Peninsula Area, Australia. Speaking back to physical <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> "choice," three consistent themes emerged: shame, gendered positioning, and welfarism. In conclusion, the perspectives of Torres Strait islanders and Northern Peninsula Area communities {{suggest that there are}} deeply embedded ways of thinking about the body, familial obligations, and the provision of and access to being active that are not consistent with Western health policies predicated upon individuals shouldering responsibility for "taking exercise.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{understand}} parents 2 ̆ 7 {{perspectives of}} their preschoolers 2 ̆ 7 physical activity behaviours. METHODS: A maximum variation sample of 71 parents explored their preschoolers 2 ̆ 7 physical activity behaviours through 10 semi-structured focus group discussions. RESULTS: Parents perceived Canada 2 ̆ 7 s Physical Activity Guidelines for Children as inadequate; that their preschoolers get and {{need more than}} 30 - 90 minutes of activity daily; and that physical activity habits must be established during the preschool years. Nine barriers against and facilitators toward adequate physical activity were proposed: child 2 ̆ 7 s age, weather, daycare, siblings, finances, time, society and safety, parents 2 ̆ 7 impact, and child 2 ̆ 7 s activity preferences. DISCUSSION: The need for education and interventions that address current barriers are essential for establishing physical <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> behaviour during early childhood and, consequently, helping to prevent both childhood and adulthood obesity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Pharmacists {{have the}} unique {{opportunity}} to promote phys-ical <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> obesity prevention <b>lifestyle</b> measure while providing med-ication counseling. Common child-hood disorders treated with medica-tions include asthma, type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, attention-defi cit hyperactivity disorder, juvenile arthri-tis, and mental disorders. Medications are always associated with benefi ts and risks; in some situations, the medi-cation may allow a child to enjoy phys-ical activity that otherwise might not be possible. In other situations, the med-ication may cause side effects {{that could result in}} physical limitations. Educational efforts on the benefi ts of physical activity {{to reduce the risk of}} chronic disease must be enhanced...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Comparative {{effectiveness}} research (CER) {{is designed to}} support informed decision making at both the individual, population, and policy levels. The American College of Sports Medicine and partners convened a conference with the focus of building an agenda for CER {{within the context of}} physical activity and nonpharmacological lifestyle approaches in the prevention and treatment of chronic disease. This report summarizes the conference content and consensus recommendations that culminated in a CER roadmap for physical activity and lifestyle approaches to reducing the risk of chronic disease. Methods: This conference focused on presentations and discussion around the following topic areas: 1) defining CER, 2) identifying the current funding climate to support CER, 3) summarizing methods for conducting CER, and 4) identifying CER opportunities for physical activity. Results: This conference resulted in consensus recommendations to adopt a CER roadmap for physical activity and lifestyle approaches to reducing the risk of chronic disease. In general, this roadmap provides a systematic framework by which CER for physical activity can move from a planning phase to a phase of engagement in CER related to lifestyle factors with particular emphasis on physical activity to a societal change phase that results in changes in policy, practice, and health. Conclusions: It is recommended that physical activity researchers and health care providers use the roadmap developed from this conference <b>as</b> <b>a</b> method to systematically engage in and apply CER to the promotion of physical <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> key <b>lifestyle</b> behavior that can be effective at making an impact on a variety of health-related outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Most {{physical}} activity researchers {{are familiar with}} the epidemiological evidence that suggests that {{physical activity}} has {{an important role in the}} primary prevention of Type 2 diabetes. There is compelling evidence from large well-conducted prospective cohort trials to show that the risk of diabetes is reduced by up to 50 % in people who are habitually active. There is also evidence from large randomised controlled trails to support the view that physical <b>activity,</b> <b>as</b> part of <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> change program, can prevent Type 2 diabetes and the onset and progression of metabolic syndrome. This is the strongest evidence in support of a beneficial role for physical activity in the primary prevention of any health problem; much stronger than that for the links between smoking and lung cancer. This presentation will critically evaluate this evidence, and explore the notion that, while physical activity may postpone the development of Type 2 diabetes, it may not actually prevent the onset of problem at the population level. As the (self-reported) prevalence of Type 2 diabetes has more than doubled in the last 20 years, it is critical that we explore effective strategies for ensuring that we can ‘activate’ Australians sufficiently to prevent, rather than simply postpone, the development of this significant health problem...|$|R
40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} {{on the benefits of}} physical activity on human health, however, much of the world’s population does not practice it in line with the recommendations. Epidemiological studies have shown that women, people with lower socioeconomic status and ethnic groups report less physical activity. Despite these inequalities, the role of gender in physical activity has been little explored. Objective: To reflect on the relevance of gender perspective in the study of physical activity, taking as a reference its relevance in the study of health. Methodology: Review of Latin American theoretical contributions of some feminist authors which are relevant to the study of physical activity. Results: Gender perspective enables a greater understanding of the physical activity because it guides the inquiry into aspects little investigated by the traditional approach of its study, in which physical activity is understood as an individual responsibility, ignoring that gender as a system social organization imposes unequal power relations that influence physical activity and any decision regarding to the health. Thus, issues such as work, time use, the body, discourses on the movement and beauty become relevant for understanding physical <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background National {{guidelines}} {{recommend that}} healthy pregnant women take 30 {{minutes or more}} of moderate exercise a day. Most women reduce the level of physical activity during pregnancy {{but only a few}} studies of women's experiences of physical activity during pregnancy exist. The aim {{of the present study was}} to elucidate experiences and views of leisure time physical activity during pregnancy in nulliparous women who were physically active prior to their pregnancy. Methods A qualitative study was conducted by means of personal interviews. Nineteen women, all with a moderate pre-pregnancy level of physical activity but with different levels of physical activity during pregnancy, participated in the study. Content analysis was applied. Results In the analyses of experiences and views of physical activities during pregnancy, four categories and nine sub-categories were developed: Physical <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>lifestyle</b> (Habit and Desire to continue), Body awareness (Pregnancy-related discomfort, Having a complicated pregnancy and A growing body), Carefulness (Feelings of worry and Balancing worry and sense of security) and Sense of benefit (Feelings of happiness and Physical well-being). Conclusion As other studies have also shown, women find that the discomfort and complications associated with pregnancy, the growing body, and a sense of insecurity with physical activity are barriers to maintaining former levels of physical activity. This study adds a new perspective by describing women's perceptions of these barriers and of overcoming them - thus, when pregnant, the majority of the women do not cease to be physically active but continue to be so. Barriers are overcome by applying one's own experience, looking to role models, mirroring the activities of other pregnant women and following the advice of experts (midwives/physiotherapists). Women then continue to be physically active during pregnancy, most often to a lesser extent or in alternative activities, and derive considerable enjoyment and physical well-being from this. </p...|$|E

Methods applied in the thesis: To find out the effectiveness of the controlled exercise intervention, it was applied, for three months, to a group of four persons (one male and three females, aged 28 to 36). The effectiveness was evaluated by exercise test in a laboratory run by FTVS UK in Prague. Outcome: The first proband managed to reduce the overall weight by 2 kg (i. e. 2. 65 %), out of which the percentage of body fat decreased by 11. 82 % and the weight of fat-free matter increased by 0. 2 kg (i. e. 0. 3 %). The ECM/BCM ratio increased by 0. 04 (i. e. 4. 7 %). The value of aerobic endurance VO 2 max increased by 8. 9 ml. kg- 1. min- 1 (i. e. 23. 2 %). The running speed per one kilometre (min. km- 1) at the anaerobic threshold level fell from the original 4 : 58 minutes to 4 : 30 minutes (acceleration of 28 seconds). Probands Nos. 2, 3 and 4 managed, on average, to increase their overall weight by 1. 7 kg (i. e. 2. 11 %), out of which the percentage of body fat increased by 3. 07 % and the weight of fat-free matter increased, on average, by 0. 73 kg (i. e. 1. 11 %).
