2500|$|The Vancouver and District Waterfront Workers' Association (VDWWA) was {{established}} as a company union following a defeated longshoremen's strike in 1923, replacing the International Longshoremen's Association. Communist organizers with the Workers' Unity League (WUL) managed to seize control of the VDWWA's executive a decade later and transformed it into a militant union, which then began working towards strike action. A strike, or more accurately a lock-out, finally commenced on 27 May 1935. This was several months after an agreement had been reached between the union and the Shipping Federation of British Columbia, but the terms of which were unfavourable to the longshoremen. In late May, union membership voted {{to take over the}} despatching of work gangs on the harbour to load and unload ships as required. Despatching was a key issue for longshoremen, and prior to the 1923 strike had been carried out by the union. Longshoremen claimed that the Shipping Federation of British Columbia, an employers' association of waterfront-based companies and the main employer on the docks, unfairly discriminated against workers. Especially targeted were those considered sympathetic to an independent union or simply disliked by the despatcher, making the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> a punitive mechanism and the job itself insecure. When the union unilaterally took over despatching, the Federation claimed it was a violation of their agreement and locked out the longshoremen. Replacement workers, known pejoratively as [...] "scabs" [...] by strikers, were mobilized along with hundreds of police specials recruited to break the strike.|$|E

In this way, gender plays a mediating role in work discrimination, and women find themselves in positions that do not allow for the same advancements as males.|$|E

Within this context his main contribution has been to endogenize the definition of both means and ends, and to clarify that by considering only leisure as argument of the utility function is tantamount to assuming that workers are physical 'things' not different from iron instead of human beings. On the basis of this critique various welfare theorems could be re-stated: the sum of utilities and productivity of work instead of the utility alone have to be equal in each use; the technological efficiency is not any more an essential requirement for economic efficiency; and the maximization of profit does not any more imply an efficient <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

40|$|Career {{progression}} {{for women}} academics {{to higher levels}} is not in proportion to their representation within the profession. This paper looks at theories about this and relates them to current practices within universities for allocating <b>work.</b> The management <b>of</b> workloads can disadvantage women {{through a number of}} interactive factors. Interruptions in continuity of employment and fractional contracts can work to exclude or hinder research activity, an area pivotal for higher progression. The issue that many models for allocating work exclude research from their calculations exacerbates this. Additionally this feeds off expectations that research work is conducted after hours at home, a feature that women may find more difficult.

40|$|Function Allocation {{methods are}} {{important}} for the appropriate allocation of tasks between humans and automated systems. It is proposed that Operational Event Sequence Diagrams (OESDs) provide a simple yet rigorous basis upon which <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> can be assessed. This is illustrated {{with respect to a}} design concept for a passenger aircraft flown by just a single pilot where the objective is to replace or supplement functions normally undertaken by the second pilot with advanced automation. A scenario-based analysis (take off) was used in which there would normally be considerable demands and interactions with the second pilot. The OESD analyses indicate those tasks that would be suitable for allocation to automated assistance on the flight deck and those tasks that are now redundant in this new configuration (something that other formal Function Allocation approaches cannot identify). Furthermore, OESDs are demonstrated to be an easy to apply and flexible approach to the allocation of function in prospective systems.

30|$|Economists {{have been}} inquiring about the {{determinants}} of labor supply, the intra-household <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> resources, and {{the economic impact of}} physical attractiveness for decades. Is there any common link among all these different forces? As illustrated in the seminal work byChiappori (1992), the family has considerable influence on the behavior of its members, and in particular on their labor supply choices. The wife’s decision power, which depends on her characteristics and wellbeing outside marriage relative to her spouse’s (relative age, wage, education, non-labor income, divorce laws, etc.), will affect both her own and her husband’s <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> hours <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Although many studies have analyzed the role of spouses’ differences along several dimensions, the literature has remained silent on the role of differences in physical attractiveness 1. This is somewhat surprising, since relative attractiveness seems to be a relevant determinant of the bargaining power of each spouse, and existing works directly link physical attractiveness measures (e.g., photo ratings, body mass index) to several economic outcomes, such as individual employment status, earnings, and even criminal activity (e.g., Hamermesh and Biddle 1994; Mocan and Tekin 2010; Rooth 2009).|$|R
