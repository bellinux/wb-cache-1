5|$|The {{first showing}} of {{films in the}} Dutch East Indies was in 1900, <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> twenty years foreign productions– {{generally}} from the United States– were imported and shown throughout the country. Domestic production of documentaries had begun in 1911 but were unable to compete with imported works. By 1923 a local feature film production spearheaded by the Middle East Film Co. was announced, but the work was not completed.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on October3. It tracked westward, reaching the Caribbean Sea on October10. By October13, a large area of convection persisted from Hispaniola southwestward through Panama, <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few days the convection organized and concentrated in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. An anticyclone became established near Jamaica on October15, which created a favorable upper-level environment for the system by reducing wind shear. Around the same time, a low-level trough emerged from the Intertropical Convergence Zone, heading north off the coast of Nicaragua. Early on October 16, the system developed into a broad tropical depression about halfway between Central America and Jamaica.|$|E

5|$|A {{veteran of}} the Spanish–American War, Neuer worked as a {{brakeman}} before taking up baseball professionally. He played for various minor league teams in 1905 and 1907 before making his debut for the New York Highlanders. With New York, he threw three shutouts in seven games, and was praised by manager Clark Griffith for his pitching ability during that stretch. However, his control deteriorated after that season, <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three years he played for various minor league teams. He retired after 1910 and became an umpire. He then worked at Bendix Aviation {{until his retirement in}} 1942.|$|E
5|$|After Hitler's death, Speer {{offered his}} {{services}} to the so-called Flensburg Government, headed by Hitler's successor, Karl Dönitz, and took {{a significant role in}} that short-lived regime. On May15, an allied delegation arrived and asked Speer if {{he would be willing to}} provide information on the effects of the air war. Speer agreed, <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> several days, provided information on a broad range of subjects. On May23, two weeks after the surrender of German forces, British troops arrested the members of the Flensburg Government and brought Nazi Germany to a formal end.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century {{there was}} a surge in {{historical}} interest in the Peasants' Revolt, spurred by the contemporary growth of the labour and socialist movements. Work by Charles Oman, Edgar Powell, André Réville and G. M. Trevelyan established the course of the revolt. By 1907 the accounts of the chroniclers were all widely available in print and the main public records concerning the events had been identified. Réville began to use the legal indictments that had been used against suspected rebels after the revolt as a fresh source of historical information, <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> century extensive research was carried out into the local economic and social history of the revolt, using scattered local sources across south-east England.|$|E

5|$|Born {{near the}} eastern edge of the Cape Colony, Kruger took part in the Great Trek as a child during the late 1830s. He had almost no {{education}} apart from the Bible and, through his interpretations of scripture, believed the Earth was flat. A protégé of the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, he witnessed the signing of the Sand River Convention with Britain in 1852 <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> decade played a prominent role in the forging of the South African Republic, leading its commandos and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions.

5|$|In 1646, the Parliamentary Colonels John Birch and Robert Kyrle marched {{south from}} their {{successful}} Siege of Hereford and besieged the castle, {{with the aim}} of eliminating {{one of the few remaining}} Royalist strongholds. There was some personal animosity between Lingen and Birch, and both were outspoken, impulsive men. Birch's first move was to prevent further attacks from Lingen, and on 9March he burned the weakly defended stables in a surprise night attack, driving away the Royalist horses and temporarily denying the Royalist forces' mobility. Birch was unable to press home his advantage however, <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few months Lingen succeeded in replacing some of his horses and resumed his attacks on Parliamentary forces.|$|E

In 1792 Rotheram was made first lieutenant of HMS Culloden and was still in this position when the French Revolutionary War broke out a year later. Culloden was part of the Channel Fleet under Rotheram's old commander Lord Howe, and the ship was captained by Isaac Schomberg during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794, in which Howe pursued a French fleet deep into the Atlantic, bringing it to battle at the Glorious First of June.|$|E

Government inquiries into the incident began and Bute, among others, provided analysis and reports to Whitehall. In the aftermath, Richard Lewis, one of the radical crowd, was hanged in Cardiff. The execution proved controversial and it is unknown whether Bute, who had by then left to attend Parliament in London, approved of the decision.|$|E

5|$|The {{triangular}} {{area was}} originally home to Victorian housing but in 1977, the city used eminent domain {{to purchase the}} area southwest of Mount Vernon Square itself, <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few years, the homes and businesses on these blocks were razed. In the 1980s, Golub Realty and Willco Construction purchased the site and proposed an 11-floor office block. They sold it to Peterson Co., who sold it to Monument Realty in May 1999. Monument Realty had envisaged building either an office and retail complex, or a 1,000-room hotel. They finally sold it to Boston Properties for $43.2 million in October 2000.

5|$|To {{strengthen}} the division's positions, the 1st Brigade was brought {{forward into the}} front lines overnight. The next day, an attack was launched by the brigade's 1st Wellington Battalion. Supported by artillery, which suppressed an attack made by the Germans minutes {{before the start of}} the battalion's advance from Flers Village, Grove Alley was captured. That evening the weather deteriorated <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few days rain filled trenches and shell holes, and turned the ground to thick mud. The New Zealanders were continually harassed by German artillery and localised attacks from the spur overlooking Grove Alley. Despite the conditions, the 1st Brigade carried out operations to {{strengthen the}} division's exposed left flank, but it remained vulnerable to enfilade fire from the German positions.|$|E
5|$|When Korea {{was split}} into two {{separate}} countries, North and South, along the 38th parallel tensions {{between the two countries}} were worsened when other countries began to get involved on both sides.
