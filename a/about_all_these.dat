Since the verb encodes information <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> arguments, {{any of them}} can always be dropped (see pro-drop, null subject). It {{is not uncommon for}} pronoun arguments to be dropped.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{philosophers}} of mathematics were already beginning to divide into various schools of thought <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> questions, broadly distinguished by their pictures of mathematical epistemology and ontology. Three schools, formalism, intuitionism, and logicism, emerged at this time, partly in response to the increasingly widespread worry that mathematics as it stood, and analysis in particular, did not live up to the standards of certainty and rigor that had been taken for granted. Each school addressed the issues that came to the fore at that time, either attempting to resolve them or claiming that mathematics is not entitled to its status as our most trusted knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Children and {{adolescents}} often use the Internet (including social media) in ways which risk their privacy: {{a cause for}} growing concern among parents. Young people also may not realise that all their information and browsing can and may be tracked while visiting a particular site, {{and that it is}} up to them to protect their own privacy. They must be informed <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> risks. For example, on Twitter, threats include shortened links that lead one to potentially harmful places. In their e-mail inbox, threats include email scams and attachments that get them to install malware and disclose personal information. On Torrent sites, threats include malware hiding in video, music, and software downloads. Even when using a smartphone, threats include geolocation, meaning that one's phone can detect where they are and post it online for all to see. Users can protect themselves by updating virus protection, using security settings, downloading patches, installing a firewall, screening e-mail, shutting down spyware, controlling cookies, using encryption, fending off browser hijackers, and blocking pop-ups.|$|E

500|$|... "I {{brought it}} up at some point because the song that the title came from was 'Dusty', but my title for it was 'Down on the Upside', but Ben wrote the music and he called it 'Dusty'. So since we don't really like having song titles being {{the title of the}} record, 'cause it brings this weird, undue focus to the song, I thought it would be cool to call it Down on the Upside. We started {{thinking}} <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> other titles, and worrying about them describing the whole record without excluding anything... So it was the last minute and we were at a photo shoot for Spin and someone called and said, 'We need your title now so we can start doing the record package,' so Matt [...] brought up the title again, and everyone went, 'yeah, that's it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Fifteen" [...] was {{directed}} by Roman White, who previously directed Swift's music video [...] "You Belong with Me". White began {{with the intention of}} creating a video different than others Swift did in the past. To do so, he believed he needed to set the video outside of high school. White explained, [...] "Well, I think I really wanted this video to kind of be an evolution for Taylor [...] I actually said to her, 'I don't think we should shoot in a high school.' And I don't think she wanted to either." [...] White conceptualized the video's setting by taking into account the literal meaning of the song and transforming into something new. He conceptualized the setting to be new world where Swift could revisit her memories, as they manifest around her. [...] "Let's take the literal meaning of this song and watch it evolve in front of us ... almost as a memory in your head. And create this world, somewhere you walk in on this desolate desert and you start to sing <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> great memories you have... of everything you love blooming around you, and so we literally grew this garden around her", White said. [...] The world moved from one situation to the next. White decided to annex surreal elements to create a cross between a garden and the heart of the memories. He intertwined Swift's emotions with the growth of the garden. The garden grew when Swift felt happy, but at the sight of pain and negative emotions, clouds appear and the garden dies, which also symbolized Anderson's broken heart.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} {{between the}} two also saw racial dust-ups caused by perceptions of remarks made by campaign surrogates. [...] In March 2008 Ferraro gave {{an interview with the}} Daily Breeze in which she said: [...] "If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept." [...] (Ferraro had made a similar comment in 1988 disparaging Jesse Jackson's candidacy in the party's presidential primaries, saying that because of his [...] "radical" [...] views, [...] "if Jesse Jackson were not black, he wouldn't be in the race.") Ferraro justified the statements by referring to her own run for vice president. Echoing a statement she wrote about herself in 1988, Ferraro said that [...] "I was talking about historic candidacies and what I started off by saying (was that) {{if you go back to}} 1984 and look at my historic candidacy, which I had just talked <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things, in 1984, if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would have never been chosen as a vice-presidential candidate. It had nothing to do with my qualification." [...] Her comments resonated with some older white women, but generated an immediate backlash elsewhere. There was strong criticism and charges of racism from many supporters of Obama and Obama called them [...] "patently absurd". Clinton publicly expressed disagreement with Ferraro's remarks, while Ferraro vehemently denied she was a racist. Again speaking to the Breeze, Ferraro responded to the attacks by saying: [...] "I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?" [...] Ferraro resigned from Clinton's finance committee on , 2008, two days after the firestorm began, saying that she didn't want the Obama camp to use her comments to hurt Clinton's campaign.|$|E

2500|$|... "You {{know that}} I have always {{considered}} that {{literature and the}} arts pursue an aim independent of morality. Beauty of conception and style is enough for me. But this book, whose title (Fleurs du mal) says everything, is clad, as you will see, in a cold and sinister beauty. It was created with rage and patience. Besides, the proof of its positive worth is in all the ill that they speak of it. The book enrages people. Moreover, since I was terrified myself of the horror that I should inspire, I cut out a third from the proofs. They deny me everything, the spirit of invention and even {{the knowledge of the}} French language. I don't care a rap <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> imbeciles, and I know that this book, with its virtues and its faults, will make its way in the memory of the lettered public, beside the best poems of V. Hugo, Th. Gautier and even Byron." ...|$|E
2500|$|Noel Gallagher was {{an early}} {{champion}} of the band, inviting them to support at Oasis’ historic Knebworth concerts, but from the outset of their career, Kula Shaker polarised UK media opinion. This arguably stemmed from age old British preconceptions about class and race. Not only were they white youngsters singing about Krishna in Sanskrit, they were seen as coming from privileged middle class backgrounds. Speaking {{in an interview in}} 2016, Mills says [...] "When I was in private schools, they called me 'common', and when I was in state schools they called me 'posh'. It made me very cynical <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> labels." [...] At the height of Britpop, and 'lager culture', music publications like Melody Maker, Select, and NME often focused on the class angle and ridiculed Kula's fascination with Indian culture. Mills commented in 2016: [...] "The musical styles on K are mainstream now. [...] people didn't know how to understand it or where to place it, so all that was left to do was deride it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Ryan Seacrest, Clarkson stated {{that she and her}} producers strove to record her voice in the album as it is heard at live performances, with as little auto-tune processing as possible, saying [...] "What separates this album are the vocals. They sound richer and fuller, and, for the first time, how I sound when I’m performing live. The producers I worked with just let me sing and be me." [...] Clarkson remarked that [...] "It was a lot of soulful stuff. You know what I'm saying? Like, Radiohead is alternative, but they're very soulful. And Sheryl Crow, very soulful singer-songwriter. So it's all very soulful, rhythmic pop rock." [...] Shortly after the final track listing was revealed, MTV observed that the word [...] "you" [...] featured prominently in the songs' titles. Clarkson asserted [...] "They're all different 'you's'. There's no common, like, it wasn't like one, I didn't have a bad breakup or anything, it wasn't like that. No, I just think life is about relationships, so I always write <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> different ones going on in my life and I don't really have a filter.

2500|$|As well, the hip hop music {{community}} {{has been criticized for}} its homophobia and transphobia. Hip hop song lyrics contain offensive, homophobic slurs (most popularly, the pejorative term [...] "faggot") and sometimes violent threats towards queer people, such as rapper DMX's [...] "Where the Hood At," [...] rapper Eazy-E's [...] "Nobody Move," [...] rap group Brand Nubian's [...] "Punks Jump Up to Get Beat Down". Many rappers and hip hop artists have advocated homophobia and/or transphobia. These artists include Ja Rule, who in an interview claimed,"We need to go step to MTV and Viacom, and let's talk <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> fucking shows that they have on MTV that is promoting homosexuality, that my kids can’t watch this shit," [...] and rap artist Erick Sermon, who has said publicly," [...] will never accept transgender rappers." [...] Until the 2010s, hip hop music has excluded the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. This has perpetuated a culture in hip hop that is prejudiced towards queer and trans people, making it a tough culture for queer artists to participate in. Despite this prejudice, some queer/genderqueer rappers and hip hop artists have become successful and popular in the 2010s. One of the more notable members of the LGBT community in hip hop is Frank Ocean, who came out in 2012 and has released critically acclaimed albums and won two Grammy Awards. Other successful queer hip hop/rap artists include female bisexual rapper Azealia Banks, pansexual androgynous rapper and singer Angel Haze, lesbian rapper Siya, and genderqueer rapper Mykki Blanco.|$|E
