5|$|From 1903 to 1905 the {{original}} school building {{was known as}} Pocantico Lodge, a small year-round hotel. In 1905 Alice Knox, an employee <b>at</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Dow's School, opened Miss Knox's School in the building. Destroyed by fire in 1912, the school moved to nearby Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. The Knox School moved to St. James, on Long Island, in 1954. The only remaining feature of the Pocantico Lodge building is a stone retaining wall {{in front of the}} current building on the site, built in 1925 by Oscar Vatet for Rufus P. Johnston (pastor of John D. Rockefeller's Fifth Avenue Baptist Church). The building, later occupied by Arthur O'Connor, Cognitronics, and Frank B. Hall, is currently an unused part of Briarcliff Corporate Campus.|$|E

Toby appears, enraged <b>at</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Lovett's death, and Todd allows Toby to slit his throat with his own razor. Toby leaves as Todd bleeds to death over his dead wife.|$|E
5|$|After a large fire at Miss Knox's School (site of the Briarcliff Corporate Campus) in 1912, the department's {{equipment}} was upgraded {{to deal with}} larger fires. The village purchased its first motorized vehicle, an American LaFrance pumper truck. The existing hose-and-chemical wagon was motorized and became the chief's car. In 1914, the Briarcliff Manor Municipal Building was constructed to house the government and fire engines. The likeness of its garage doors {{can be seen in}} the façade of the present restaurant. Later in 1914 the department established sub-stations <b>at</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Whitson's barn on Pleasantville Road and on the Holden farm at Scarborough Road (roughly opposite the current firehouse); these were discontinued in 1921. The first major fire to involve the motorized vehicles was in 1916 at the central business district. In spite of the new equipment, several buildings at the northern end were destroyed. The 1908 hook-and-ladder truck was motorized in 1923 and two years later, the chief's car was replaced by another American LaFrance vehicle. An electric siren was installed in 1928 after a complaint that the previous alarm sounded more like a call to breakfast than an alarm of fire.|$|E

5|$|Another {{close friend}} of SpongeBob is Sandy Cheeks, a {{squirrel}} from Texas. She is a scientist and an expert in karate. She lives in an oak tree entrapped in a clear glass dome locked by an airtight, hand-turned seal. When outside of her dwelling, she wears an astronaut-like suit because she cannot breathe underwater. Mr. Krabs, a miserly crab obsessed with money, {{is the owner of}} the Krusty Krab restaurant and SpongeBob's boss. Krabs has a teenage whale daughter named Pearl, whom he values equally with his riches. His rival, Plankton, is a small green copepod who owns a low-rank fast-food restaurant called the Chum Bucket, located {{across the street from the}} Krusty Krab. Plankton spends most of his time planning to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers, so as to gain the upper hand and put the Krusty Krab out of business. The majority of Plankton's plans come from his intelligent yet sarcastic computer wife Karen, who is more competent and less conceited than him. When SpongeBob is not working at the Krusty Krab, he can often be found <b>at</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Puff's boating school (the underwater equivalent of a driver's education course). SpongeBob is perpetually unable to pass Mrs. Puff's exams, which is why he almost always walks around town.|$|E

30|$|We {{found that}} {{patients}} with poor functional outcome <b>at</b> discharge (<b>mRS</b> 5 – 6) had lower nadir hemoglobin values than patients with good functional outcome. Patients with low admission hemoglobin values had longer lengths of stay, but only nadir hemoglobin remained an independent predictor of LOS after controlling for other factors impacting outcome. After controlling for age, NIHSS, and admission hemoglobin, transfusion did not remain {{a significant predictor of}} NIHSS at discharge and poor functional outcome at discharge.|$|R
40|$|Background: Recovery from stroke {{is presumed}} to be a {{function}} of a cerebral network. Chronic small vessel disease (SVD) has been shown to disrupt this network’s integrity and has been proposed as a predictor of poor outcome after stroke. We studied this hypothesis in patients with acute ischemic stroke of the striatocapsular region, an area of pronounced cortical and subcortical connectivity. Methods: We identified 62 patients with isolated striatocapsular stroke from our stroke registry. The standardized workup included clinical rating according to the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and MRI, rated according to the Fazekas scale for the extent of SVD, ranging from grade 0 to III. <b>MRS</b> <b>at</b> admission, at discharge, and a short-term recovery parameter (the difference between <b>mRS</b> <b>at</b> admission and discharge) were correlated with the extent of SVD. Comorbidity was assessed with the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Results: SVD was graded 0 in 7 %, I in 60 %, II in 18 %, and III in 16 % of patients. The median <b>mRS</b> <b>at</b> discharge for the groups was 2, 1, 2 and 4, and the median recovery parameter was 2, 1, 1 and 0. 5, respectively. The extent of SVD significantly correlated with both the <b>mRS</b> <b>at</b> discharge and the recovery parameter. While age was also a significant predictor of these outcome parameters, SVD severity was a significant predictor even after correction for age or CCI. Conclusions: SVD is a predictor of poor outcome and recovery in striatocapsular stroke, independent of age or comorbidity. Severe SVD disturbs the integrity of the cerebral network leading to aggravation of and poor recovery from neurological deficits. Copyright (c) 2011 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|R

25|$|<b>At</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Lavell's {{request for}} {{judicial}} review of the Registrar's decision, Mrs. Lavell's case was referred to Judge B.W. Grossberg of the York County Court as per section 9(3) of the Indian Act. Mrs. Lavell argued that Section 12(1)(b) of the Indian Act was inoperative due to an irreconcilable abridgement of her right to equality before the law, guaranteed by the Canadian Bill of Rights. In particular, Mrs. Lavell asserted that the Indian Act discriminated against Indian women since only they lost their status as an Indian under the Act, whereas Indian men could marry whomever they so desired without adverse legal consequence. The decision of registrar, she argued, must therefore be reversed.|$|E
25|$|Eager {{to achieve}} fame (and {{undoubtedly}} some expiation) {{in the cause}} of anti-slavery, he emigrated to the United States of America in the fall of 1786, moving to Philadelphia. His unsuccessful efforts to lead a contingent of free black Americans to join the small British settlement of London blacks {{at the mouth of the}} Sierra Leone River in West Africa were looked on favorably by Philadelphia's Quaker establishment. Some leaders of the new republic—notably James Madison, with whom he lodged <b>at</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Mary House's prominent boarding establishment in 1787 and 1788—were cognizant of Thornton's abolitionist activities. However, after moving to the City of Washington, he took advantage of slavery. According to a diary his wife kept in 1800, he frequently shopped for slaves and bought and hired them. In 1788, he became an American citizen. Thornton married Anna Maria Brodeau, daughter of a school teacher, in 1790.|$|E
