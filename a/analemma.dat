25|$|Although GOES-3 {{ceased to}} be used for weather {{operations}} in 1989, it spent over 20 years as a critical part of communications between the U.S. and Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station before being decommissioned in 2016. Geostationary satellites expend fuel to keep themselves stationary over the equator, and thus cannot normally ordinarily be seen from the poles. When that fuel is depleted, solar and lunar perturbations increase the satellite's inclination so that its ground track begins to describe an <b>analemma</b> (a figure-8 in the north-south direction). This usually ends the satellite's primary mission. However, when the inclination is high enough the satellite may begin to rise above the polar horizons at the extremes of the figure-8, as was the case for GOES-3. A nine-meter dish was constructed at the station, and communication with the satellite could be obtained for about five hours per day. Data rates were around 2.048 megabytes/second (bi-directional) under optimum conditions.|$|E
50|$|Diagrams of <b>analemmas</b> {{frequently}} carry marks {{that show}} {{the position of the}} Sun at various closely spaced dates throughout the year. <b>Analemmas</b> with date marks can be used for various practical purposes. Without date marks, they are of little use, except as decoration.|$|R
50|$|Geosynchronous {{satellites}} {{revolve around}} the Earth with a period of one sidereal day. Seen from a fixed point on the Earth's surface, they trace paths in the sky which repeat every day, and are therefore simple and meaningful <b>analemmas.</b> They are generally roughly elliptical, teardrop shaped, or figure-8 in shape. Their shapes and dimensions depend on {{the parameters of the}} orbits. A subset of geosynchronous satellites are geostationary ones, which ideally have perfectly circular orbits, exactly in the Earth's equatorial plane. A geostationary satellite therefore ideally remains stationary relative to the Earth's surface, staying over a single point on the equator. No real satellite is exactly geostationary, so real ones trace small <b>analemmas</b> in the sky. Since the sizes of the orbits of geosynchronous satellites are similar {{to the size of the}} Earth, substantial parallax occurs, depending on the location of the observer on the Earth's surface, so observers in different places see different <b>analemmas.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Analemmas</b> (as {{they are}} known today) {{have been used in}} {{conjunction}} with sundials since the 18th century to convert between apparent and mean solar time. Prior to this, the term referred to any tool or method used in the construction of sundials.|$|R

50|$|QZSS uses three satellites, each 120° apart, {{in highly}} inclined, {{slightly}} elliptical, geosynchronous orbits. Because of this inclination, {{they are not}} geostationary; they do not remain {{in the same place}} in the sky. Instead, their ground traces are asymmetrical figure-8 patterns (<b>analemmas),</b> designed to ensure that one is almost directly overhead (elevation 60° or more) over Japan at all times.|$|R
50|$|With {{reference}} {{to the image of}} a simulated <b>analemma</b> in the eastern sky, the lowest point of the <b>analemma</b> has just risen above the horizon. If the Sun were at that point, sunrise would have just occurred. This would be the latest sunrise of the year, since all other points on the <b>analemma</b> would rise earlier. Therefore, the date of the latest sunrise is when the Sun is at this lowest point (29 December, when the <b>analemma</b> is tilted as seen from latitude 50° north, as is shown in the diagram); however, in some areas that use daylight saving time, the date of the latest sunrise occurs on the day before daylight saving time ends. Similarly, when the Sun is at the highest point on the <b>analemma,</b> near its top-left end, (on 15 June) the earliest sunrise of the year will occur. Likewise, at sunset, the earliest sunset will occur when the Sun is at its lowest point on the <b>analemma</b> when it is close to the western horizon, and the latest sunset when it is at the highest point.|$|E
5000|$|In diagrams, the <b>analemma</b> {{is drawn}} {{as it would}} be seen in the sky by an {{observer}} looking upward. If north is at the top, west is to the right. This corresponds with the sign of the equation of time, which is positive in the westward direction. The further west the Sun is, compared with its mean position, the more [...] "fast" [...] a sundial is, compared with a clock. (See Equation of time#Sign of the equation of time.) If the <b>analemma</b> is a graph with positive declination (north) plotted upward, positive equation of time (west) is plotted to the right. This is the conventional orientation for graphs. When the <b>analemma</b> is marked on a geographical globe, west in the <b>analemma</b> is to the right, while the geographical features on the globe are shown with west to the left. To avoid this confusion, {{it has been suggested that}} analemmas on globes should be printed with west to the left, but this is not done, at least, not frequently. In practice, the <b>analemma</b> is so nearly symmetrical that the shapes of the mirror images are not easily distinguished, but if date markings are present, they go in opposite directions. The Sun moves eastward on the <b>analemma</b> near the solstices. This can be used to tell which way the <b>analemma</b> is printed. See the image above, at high magnification.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{parameters}} {{that affect the}} size and shape of the <b>analemma</b> — obliquity, eccentricity, and the angle between the apse line and the line of solstices. Viewed from an object with a perfectly circular orbit and no axial tilt, the Sun would always appear at the same point in the sky at the same time of day throughout the year and the <b>analemma</b> would be a dot. For an object with a circular orbit but significant axial tilt, the <b>analemma</b> would be a figure of eight with northern and southern lobes equal in size. For an object with an eccentric orbit but no axial tilt, the <b>analemma</b> would be a straight east-west line along the celestial equator.|$|E
50|$|The {{measurement}} should, of course, {{be done on}} the diagram, but {{it should}} be expressed in terms of the angle that would be subtended at an observer on the ground by the corresponding distance in the <b>analemma</b> in the sky. It can be useful to compare it with the length of the <b>analemma,</b> which subtends 47 degrees. Thus, for example, if the length of the equatorial segment on the diagram is 0.4 times the length of the <b>analemma</b> on the diagram, then the segment in the celestial <b>analemma</b> would subtend 0.4 × 47 or 18.8° at the observer on the ground. The angle, in degrees, should be divided by 15 to get the time difference in hours between sunrise and 6 a.m. The sign of the difference is clear from the diagram. If the horizon line at sunrise passes above the origin of the <b>analemma,</b> the Sun rises before 6 a.m., and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|The <b>analemma</b> is {{oriented}} {{with the}} smaller loop appearing {{north of the}} larger loop. At the North Pole, the <b>analemma</b> would be completely upright (an 8 with the small loop at the top), and only {{the top half of}} it would be visible. Heading south, once below the Arctic Circle, the entire <b>analemma</b> would become visible. If you see it at noon, it continues to be upright, and rises higher from the horizon as you move south. When you get to the equator, it is directly overhead. As you go further south, it moves toward the northern horizon, and is then seen with the larger loop at the top. If, on the other hand, you looked at the <b>analemma</b> in the early morning or evening, it would start to tilt to one side as you moved southward from the North Pole. By time you got down to the equator, the <b>analemma</b> would be completely horizontal. Then, as you continued to go south, it would continue rotating so that the small loop was beneath the large loop in the sky. Once you crossed the Antarctic Circle, the <b>analemma,</b> now nearly completely inverted, would start to disappear, until only 50%, part of the larger loop, was visible from the South Pole.|$|E

50|$|The exact {{dates are}} those {{on which the}} Sun is at the points where the horizon is {{tangential}} to the <b>analemma,</b> which in turn depend on how much the <b>analemma,</b> or the north-south meridian passing through it, is tilted from the vertical. This angle of tilt is essentially the co-latitude (90 degrees minus the latitude) of the observer. Calculating these dates numerically is complex, {{but they can be}} estimated fairly accurately by placing a straight-edge, tilted at the appropriate angle, tangential to a diagram of the <b>analemma,</b> and reading the dates (interpolating as necessary) when the Sun is at the positions of contact.|$|E
50|$|The <b>analemma</b> {{is drawn}} {{as it would}} be seen in the sky by an {{observer}} looking upward. If north is shown at the top, west is to the right.

5000|$|In astronomy, an <b>analemma</b> ( [...] ; from Greek [...] <b>analēmma</b> [...] "support") is {{a diagram}} showing the {{variation}} {{in the position of}} the Sun in the sky {{over the course of a}} year, as viewed at a fixed time of day and from a fixed location on the Earth. The north-south component of the <b>analemma</b> is due to variance of the Sun's declination caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis, and the east-west component is due to nonuniform rate of change of the Sun's right ascension, governed by combined effects of axial tilt and Earth's orbital eccentricity. The diagram has the form of a slender figure eight, and can often be found on globes of the Earth.|$|E
5000|$|The {{use of the}} {{adjective}} [...] "analemmatic" [...] to describe this class of sundial can be misleading, {{because there is no}} use of the equation of time or the <b>analemma</b> in the design of an analemmatic sundial.

50|$|In {{temperate}} latitudes, {{the dates}} get {{further from the}} solstices as the absolute value of the latitude decreases. In near-equatorial latitudes, the situation is more complex.
