5|$|A 2017 study {{examined}} the histology of thin-sectioned dodo bones, modern Mauritian birds, local ecology, and contemporary accounts, to recover information about the life history of the dodo. The study suggested that dodos bred around August, after having potentially fattened themselves, corresponding with the fat and thin cycles of many vertebrates of Mauritius. The chicks grew rapidly, reaching robust, almost adult, sizes, and sexual maturity before <b>Austral</b> <b>summer</b> or the cyclone season. Adult dodos which had just bred moulted after <b>Austral</b> <b>summer,</b> around March. The feathers of the wings and tail were replaced first, and the moulting would have completed {{at the end of}} July, in time for the next breeding season. Different stages of moulting may also account for inconsistencies in contemporary descriptions of dodo plumage.|$|E
5|$|Cryolophosaurus {{originally}} was {{collected during the}} 1990–91 <b>austral</b> <b>summer</b> on Mount Kirkpatrick in the Beardmore Glacier region of the Transantarctic Mountains. The discovery was made by Hammer, a professor at Augustana College, and his team. The fossils {{were found in the}} siliceous siltstone of the Hanson Formation, formerly the upper Falla Formation, and dated to the Pliensbachian stage of the early Jurassic. Cryolophosaurus was the second dinosaur, and first theropod, to be discovered in Antarctica. It was discovered after Antarctopelta, but named earlier.|$|E
5|$|Isotope {{studies have}} {{established}} that the lake has long had a permanent ice cover. Further, studies carried out during the <b>austral</b> <b>summer</b> confirm the lake's homogeneous characteristics, with thermal convection as the reason given for its hydro-geochemical and isotropical nature. It is replenished perennially by a process of underwater melting of the adjacent glacier ice. It is also stated that the lake existed during the Holocene period when it emerged from a melt-water pond.|$|E

5000|$|Rand Peak (...) is a {{prominent}} peak (1510 m) {{in the south}} part of Nebraska Peaks, Britannia Range. Named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) after John H.

25|$|Maintenance {{on the ice}} pier {{begins at}} the end of the <b>austral</b> <b>summer.</b> Equipment {{operators}} remove the gravel and store it for the next season. Removing the gravel prevents the gravel’s insulating qualities from inhibiting further thickening of the ice during winter. Winter operations include plowing insulating snow from the dock and flooding the pier with seawater to help sustain the ice strength.|$|E
25|$|Thus primary {{production}} – {{the conversion of}} sunlight into organic biomass, {{the foundation of the}} food chain – has an annual carbon fixation of 1–2g/m2 in the open ocean. Close to the ice it can reach 30–50g/m2. These values are not outstandingly high, compared to very productive areas like the North Sea or upwelling regions, but the area over which it takes place is enormous, even compared to other large primary producers such as rainforests. In addition, during the <b>Austral</b> <b>summer</b> there are many hours of daylight to fuel the process. All of these factors make the plankton and the krill a critical part of the planet's ecocycle.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Antarctic Division {{conducted}} {{an expedition to}} Heard Island during the <b>austral</b> <b>summer</b> of 2003-04. A small team of scientists spent two months on the island, conducting studies on avian and terrestrial biology and glaciology. Glaciologists conducted further research on the Brown Glacier, {{in an effort to}} determine whether glacial retreat is rapid or punctuated. Using a portable echo sounder, the team took measurements of the volume of the glacier. Monitoring of climatic conditions continued, with an emphasis on the impact of Foehn winds on glacier mass balance. Based on the findings of that expedition, the rate of loss of glacier ice on Heard Island appears to be accelerating. Between 2000 and 2003, repeat GPS surface surveys revealed that the rate of loss of ice in both the ablation zone and the accumulation zone of Brown Glacier was more than double average rate measured from 1947 to 2003. The increase in the rate of ice loss suggests that the glaciers of Heard Island are reacting to ongoing climate change, rather than approaching dynamic equilibrium. The retreat of Heard Island's glaciers is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.|$|E
50|$|Conant Valley is {{a valley}} between Duncan Bluff and Communication Heights in the {{southern}} part of the Darwin Mountains; the valley mouth opens to Hatherton Glacier.

500|$|The {{species is}} territorial, with the males {{defending}} the territory. Nesting timing varies by location; in Venezuela {{it is reported}} to occur {{during the rainy season}} (June to September), and in Argentina during the <b>austral</b> <b>summer</b> (October to January). The nests are cup-shaped, [...] across, [...] high and [...] deep. Nests have been recorded being constructed from fine dry grass, or woven plant fibre and a few rootlets. Nests are placed in the forks of branches [...] up in trees [...] tall. The clutch size is three eggs, which are greenish with brown spots. Both sexes incubate the eggs during the 14–15 day brooding period. The species has been described as very tame during this interval – staying on the nest even as researchers came within a few centimetres of the bird – but were very aggressive in attacking birds, like guira cuckoos, or other animals that came near the nest. The hatchlings are dark-skinned with grey down and pink mouths. Pink mouths in chicks are very unusual in suboscines.|$|E
