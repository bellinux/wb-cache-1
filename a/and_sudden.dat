5|$|About 6% {{of those}} with {{epilepsy}} have seizures that are often triggered by specific events and are known as reflex seizures. Those with reflex epilepsy have seizures that are only triggered by specific stimuli. Common triggers include flashing lights <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> noises. In certain types of epilepsy, seizures happen more often during sleep, and in other types they occur almost only when sleeping.|$|E
5|$|Romanian vampires {{were said}} to bite their victims over the heart or between the eyes, <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> deaths could {{indicate}} {{the presence of a}} vampire. Graves were often opened five or seven years after burial and the corpse checked for vampirism, before being washed and reburied.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the coma}} and tail are {{illuminated}} by the Sun and may become visible when a comet passes through the inner Solar System, the dust reflects Sunlight directly while the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible {{without the aid of}} a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Occasionally a comet may experience a huge <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of the coma greatly increases for a period of time. This happened in 2007 to Comet Holmes.|$|E

5|$|Causes include falls, vehicle collisions, and violence. Brain trauma {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of a sudden acceleration or deceleration within the cranium or by a complex combination of both movement <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> impact. In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, a variety of events in the minutes to days following the injury may result in secondary injury. These processes include alterations in cerebral blood flow and the pressure within the skull. Some of the imaging techniques used for diagnosis include computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).|$|E
5|$|Characteristics of lava dome eruptions include shallow, long-period and hybrid seismic activity, {{which is}} {{attributed}} to excess fluid pressures in the contributing vent chamber. Other characteristics of lava domes include their spherical dome shape, cycles of dome growth over long periods, <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> onsets of violent explosive activity. The average rate of dome growth {{may be used as}} a rough indicator of magma supply, but it shows no systematic relationship to the timing or characteristic of lava dome explosions.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, about 100,000 pilgrims {{paid tribute}} to St. Barbara at St. Michael's Monastery. Before the Russian Revolution in 1917, rings {{manufactured}} and blessed at St. Michael's Monastery, known as St. Barbara's rings, were very popular among the citizens of Kiev. They usually served as good luck charms and, according to popular beliefs, occasionally protected against witchcraft but were also effective against serious illnesses <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> death. These beliefs reference the facts that the Monastery was not affected by the plague epidemics in 1710 and 1770 and cholera epidemics of the nineteenth century.|$|E

5|$|The 1900 season {{revealed}} grave {{problems with}} Rostislavs boilers. Black smoke from burning oil was more conspicuous than coal smoke. Uneven distribution of heat inside the boilers caused severe local overheating, buckling of fireboxes <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> backdrafts. For {{three and a}} half months the boilers failed one by one, starting with small auxiliary power units and ending with the main boilers. Oil delivered by the Rothschild-controlled Russian Standard Oil was not at fault; similar problems were experienced by oil-fired ships of the Baltic Fleet.|$|E
5|$|The ribs {{are bound}} to the spine by {{flexible}} cartilage, which allows the ribcage to collapse rather than snap under high pressure. While sperm whales are well adapted to diving, repeated dives to great depths have long-term effects. Bones show the same pitting that signals decompression sickness in humans. Older skeletons showed the most extensive pitting, whereas calves showed no damage. This damage may indicate that sperm whales are susceptible to decompression sickness, <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> surfacing could be lethal to them.|$|E
5|$|Tiger sharks {{have a large}} upper lobe, {{which allows}} for slow {{cruising}} <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> bursts of speed. The tiger shark {{must be able to}} twist and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet, whereas the porbeagle shark, which hunts schooling fish such as mackerel and herring, has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fast-swimming prey. Other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly, such as the thresher shark's usage of its powerful, elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid.|$|E

5|$|Worms Armageddon {{includes}} {{a very high}} level of customizability – in multiplayer games or skirmishes, the player can create custom game modes with preferred gameplay options and weapon sets. Regular options include starting health, whether the worms can move, how long a turn lasts, <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> death options. Weapons settings include what weapons the teams start with, which weapons will fall in crates and how often, and how powerful individual weapons are. Worms Armageddon offers several levels of customizability outside of direct gameplay options.|$|E
5|$|Dynamic editing {{contributed to}} the surrealistic nature of the episode. Abrupt cuts from {{close-up}} to extreme wide angles <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> shifts from normal speed to super slow-motion are used in Buffy's dream: several sequences become slow-motion partway through them, then revert to normal speed as they continue. Xander's dream features mismatches between sound and image: characters are sometimes shown not speaking even as their voices are heard. Additionally, silence is used frequently, to both reflect the characters' disorientation and to unsettle the audience. Whedon cited films by Steven Soderbergh as his main inspirations for the odd editing, especially The Limey and The Underneath. He also listed Orson Welles' version of The Trial and Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut as inspirations for many of his shooting and editing decisions.|$|E

5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.|$|E
5|$|People with {{epilepsy}} are at {{an increased}} risk of death. This increase is between 1.6 and 4.1 fold greater than that of the general population and is often related to: the underlying cause of the seizures, status epilepticus, suicide, trauma, <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Death from status epilepticus is primarily due to an underlying problem rather than missing doses of medications. The risk of suicide is increased between two and six times in those with epilepsy. The cause of this is unclear. SUDEP appears to be partly related to the frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and accounts for about 15% of epilepsy related deaths. It is unclear how to decrease its risk. The greatest increase in mortality from epilepsy is among the elderly. Those with epilepsy due to an unknown cause have little increased risk. In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 40–60% of deaths are possibly preventable. In the developing world, many deaths are due to untreated epilepsy leading to falls or status epilepticus.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began in}} 1979, when Deodato was {{contacted}} by German film producers {{to make a}} film similar to Last Cannibal World, which was also directed by Deodato. He accepted the project and immediately went in search of a producer, choosing his friend Francesco Palaggi. The two first flew to Colombia to scout for filming locations. Leticia was chosen as the principal filming location after Deodato met a Colombian documentary filmmaker at the airport in Bogotá, who suggested the town as a location ideal for filming. Other locations had been considered, specifically the locations where the film Burn!, directed by Gillo Pontecorvo, had been shot, but Deodato rejected these locations due to lack of suitable rainforest. Leticia was only accessible by aircraft, and from there, the cast and crew had to travel by boat to reach the set. The locale presented many problems for the production, in particular the heat <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> rain storms, which sporadically delayed filming.|$|E

5|$|The overall {{gameplay}} received mixed reviews. Some critics {{believed that}} the gameplay was enjoyable, serviceable and acceptable by modern standards, but most others agreed {{that some of the}} gameplay mechanics, such as the cover system, lacked polish and were flawed. Some critics considered the gameplay generic due to its inclusion of typical shooter elements such as on-rail and turret segments, and stated that such mechanics are unable to help the game differentiate itself from other shooters such as Gears of War, and give the game an identity crisis. Some critics lamented that gameplay occasionally disconnects players from the story, creating tonal dissonance. Many criticized the game for not having a roll mechanic. The artificial intelligence system was criticized for not being strong enough to make the game more gratifying, though some critics thought that the AI system for Adams and Lugo was well-crafted and did not suffer from severe or frequent technical problems, although {{they may not be able}} to carry out player's commands. Some critics criticized the game's low replay value, unbalanced difficulty level, <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> difficulty spike.|$|E
5|$|Several {{causes for}} the decline <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> {{disappearance}} of the hoopoe starling have been proposed, all connected to the activities of humans on Réunion, who it survived alongside for two centuries. An oft-repeated suggestion is that {{the introduction of the}} common myna (Acridotheres tristis) led to competition between these two starling species. The myna was introduced to Réunion in 1759 to combat locusts, and became a pest itself. However, the hoopoe starling coexisted with the myna for nearly 100years and they may not have shared habitat. The black rat (Rattus rattus) arrived on Reunion in the 1670s, and the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in 1735, multiplying rapidly and threatening agriculture and native species. Like the hoopoe starling, the rats inhabited tree cavities and would have preyed on eggs, juveniles, and nesting birds. During the mid-19th century the Réunion slit-eared skink (Gongylomorphus borbonicus) became extinct due to predation by the introduced wolf snake (Lycodon aulicum), which may have deprived the bird of a significant food source. Hoopoe starlings may have contracted diseases from introduced birds, a factor known to have triggered declines and extinctions in endemic Hawaiian birds. According to ecologist Anthony S. Cheke, this was the chief cause of the hoopoe starling's extinction; the species had survived for generations despite other threats.|$|E
5|$|The most {{complete}} {{books on the}} Pony Express are The Story of the Pony Express and Saddles and Spurs by Raymond & Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as {{he was the first}} writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new <b>and</b> <b>sudden</b> development, as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account {{on the history of the}} Pony Express amongst many historians.|$|E
