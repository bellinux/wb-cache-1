He was reelected in 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008.

5|$|Hobbs {{was very}} close to Ada, his wife of 56 years; the pair were able to live comfortably in later life through Hobbs' {{substantial}} wage from Surrey, his commercial endorsements, and the proceeds of the sporting goods shop he opened in 1921 <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of his life. After his cricketing retirement, he also worked in journalism. Knighted in 1953, the first professional cricketer to be so honoured, he spent his later years nursing his wife. He died, aged 81, a few months after her in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Pinafore {{opened in}} New York on 1 December 1879 (with Gilbert onstage in the chorus) <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of December. After a {{reasonably}} strong first week, audiences quickly fell off, since most New Yorkers {{had already seen}} local productions of Pinafore. This was unexpected and forced Gilbert and Sullivan to race to complete and rehearse their new opera, The Pirates of Penzance, which premiered with much success on 31 December. Shortly thereafter, Carte sent three touring companies around the United States East Coast and Midwest, playing Pinafore alongside Pirates.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} {{was a critical}} event in both candidates' political careers, with Warren becoming a political icon after entering the Senate, and being drafted to run for President in 2016. After the election loss, Brown was considered the most prominent Republican in Massachusetts and heavily favored {{to run in the}} Senate special election the following year or for Governor in 2014, though he declined to do either. He instead moved to New Hampshire <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Senate there in 2014 against Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen. He lost, 51% to 48%, becoming the first man to lose two Senate races to women.|$|E

It {{went on to}} have a total theatrical run of 26 weeks, thereby becoming a silver jubilee film. The film contributed to Ganesan's long string of successful films.|$|E
5|$|Wilkes {{was active}} in Republican Party {{political}} affairs <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United States Congress against James Brooks, losing the race in 1870, with Brooks receiving 12,845 votes and Wilkes 7149 votes. Wilkes, along with John Chamberlain and Marcus Cicero Stanley, introduced pari-mutuel betting in the United States. Wilkes also {{was active in}} promoting boxing, acting as the promoter for some prizefights. Wilkes also became involved {{in an effort to}} colonize Baja California, becoming trustee of a colonizing company in 1867. In 1877 he published his last work, Shakespeare from an American Point of View, which reflected his lifelong interest in William Shakespeare. This work was revised twice, with the third edition appearing in 1882.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of 1998, Ferraro left Crossfire <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Democratic {{nomination}} again in the 1998 United States Senate election in New York. The other candidates were Congressman Charles Schumer and New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green. She had done no fundraising, {{out of fear of}} conflict of interest with her Crossfire job, but was nonetheless immediately perceived as the front-runner. Indeed, December and January polls had her 25percentage points ahead of Green in the race and even further ahead of Schumer. Unlike the previous campaigns, her family finances never became an issue. However, she lost ground during the summer, with Schumer catching up in the polls by early August and then soon passing her. Schumer, a tireless fundraiser, outspent her by a five-to-one margin, and Ferraro failed to establish a political image current with the times. In the , 1998 primary, she was beaten soundly by Schumer by a 51percent to 26percent margin. Unlike 1992, the contest was not divisive, and Ferraro and third-place finisher Green endorsed Schumer at a unity breakfast the following day. Schumer would go on to decisively unseat D'Amato in the general election.|$|E
5|$|By October 1991, Ferraro {{was ready}} to enter {{elective}} politics again, <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Democratic nomination in the 1992 United States Senate election in New York. Her opponents were State Attorney General Robert Abrams, Reverend Al Sharpton, Congressman Robert J. Mrazek, and New York City Comptroller and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman. Abrams was considered the early front-runner. The D'Amato campaign feared facing Ferraro the most among these, as her Italian ancestry, effective debating and stump speech skills, and her staunch pro-choice views would eat into several of D'Amato's usual bases of support. Ferraro emphasized {{her career as a}} teacher, prosecutor, congresswoman, and mother, and talked about how she was tough on crime. Ferraro drew renewed attacks during the primary campaign from the media and her opponents over Zaccaro's finances and business relationships. She objected that a male candidate would not receive nearly as much attention regarding his wife's activities. Ferraro became the front-runner, capitalizing on her star power from 1984, and using the campaign attacks against her as an explicitly feminist rallying point for women voters. As the primary date neared, her lead began to dwindle under the charges, and she released additional tax returns from the 1980s to try to defray the attacks.|$|E
5|$|To stop this, the Spartan {{commander}} ordered {{some of his}} men {{to charge}} the Athenians, but the peltasts fell back, easily outrunning the hoplites, and then, when the Spartans turned {{to return to the}} regiment, the peltasts fell upon them, flinging spears at them as they fled, and inflicted casualties. This process was repeated several times, with similar results. Even when a group of Spartan cavalrymen arrived, the Spartan commander made the curious decision that they should keep pace with the hoplites in pursuit, instead of racing ahead to ride down the fleeing peltasts. Unable to drive off the peltasts, and suffering losses all the while, the Spartans were driven back to a hilltop overlooking Lechaeum. The men in Lechaeum, seeing their predicament, sailed out in small boats to as close as to the hill as they could reach, about a half mile away. The Athenians, meanwhile, began to bring up their hoplites, and the Spartans, seeing these two developments, broke <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> boats, pursued by the peltasts all the way. All in all, in the fighting and pursuit, 250 of the 600 men in the regiment were killed.|$|E

25|$|Welsh had {{determined}} not to reenter politics but in 1954 {{he changed his mind}} <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Indiana Senate, winning the election. As the General Assembly was dominated by the Republican Party at that time, Welsh had very little impact during his time as senator. In 1956, his name was entered as a candidate for governorship at the State Democratic Convention, but he was narrowly defeated in the vote by Ralph Tucker, the mayor of Terre Haute. In 1957, he became the minority leader in the state senate, a position he held until 1959.|$|E

25|$|The reason {{given for}} the {{appointments}} of Emerson and Fortier was that the Conservatives were completely {{shut out of the}} three most populous cities in Canada – Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver. The Liberals were the only party to win seats in all three, with the Bloc represented in Montreal and the NDP in Toronto and Vancouver. Emerson's riding is Vancouver Kingsway, and Fortier lives and works in the Montreal-Laval area, <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> riding of Laval West for the Tories in 2000. The only major city this left out was Toronto, although the Conservatives have indicated that they consider that enough Cabinet Ministers are from the Greater Toronto Area, including Jim Flaherty and Bev Oda, to adequately represent the city in Cabinet.|$|E

In his seven years of term, he proposed two constitutional reform proposals in 2005 and 2010 and saw the second ones passed after he reached a compromise with the pro-democracy legislators, making it {{the first and only}} political reform proposals to be passed in the SAR history. He carried out a five-year policy blueprint and ten large-scale infrastructure projects during his term. His popularity began to decline after the introduction of the Political Appointments System which was marked by controversies and scandals.|$|E
