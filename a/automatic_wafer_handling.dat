40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the process integration of a temporary <b>wafer</b> <b>handling</b> system for <b>wafer</b> thinning and thin wafer backside processing. Thin <b>wafer</b> <b>handling</b> is a key technology and enabler for the wafer level fabrication of through silicon via (TSV) based 3 D architectures. The work was done as evaluation study to prove the compatibility of a thin <b>wafer</b> <b>handling</b> system with standard processes used for thinning and backside processing of "via-first" TSV wafers {{as well as for}} thinning of bumped wafers. The used thin <b>wafer</b> <b>handling</b> system is based on perforated carrier wafers, which are bonded by an adhesive to the customer wafer and de-bonded by solvent release of the adhesive. All wafers used in this work had 200 mm format. The evaluation was run systematically in three major phases. In the first phase the main process scenarios, which require thin <b>wafer</b> <b>handling,</b> were defined. In a second phase setup trials for bonding, thinning, backside processing and debonding we re run on monitor wafers with different types of front side topography, but without TSVs. After finishing the setup trials in a third phase, the monitor wafers were replaced by wafers with copper filled TSVs, which were fabricated in "via-first" technology. Using the established thin <b>wafer</b> <b>handling</b> and processing sequence, silicon interposer wafers with 55 m thickness were manufactured.

This work investigates the influence of different wafer grippers on the optical properties of grown random pyramids as well as their impact on the quality of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si) passivation layers. The homogeneity of the random pyramids is characterized by examination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and reflectance measurements. The influence of the wafer grippers on the electrical properties is investigated by calibrating quasi-steady-state photoconductance (QSSPC) measurements to photoluminescence (PL) images.

This thesis describes the generation and mathematical verification of a dynamic model for a three degrees-of-freedom <b>wafer</b> <b>handling</b> mechanism with one linear and two rotary axes.

40|$|Photovoltaic {{manufacturing}} is material intensive {{with the}} cost of crystalline silicon wafer, used as the substrate, representing 40 % to 60 % of the solar cell cost. Consequently, there is a growing trend to reduce the silicon wafer thickness leading to new technical challenges related to manufacturing. Specifically, <b>wafer</b> breakage during <b>handling</b> and/or transfer is a significant issue. Therefore improved methods for breakage-free handling are needed to address this problem. An important pre-requisite for realizing such methods is the need for fundamental understanding of the effect of handling device variables on the deformation, stresses, and fracture of crystalline silicon wafers. This knowledge is lacking for <b>wafer</b> <b>handling</b> devices including the Bernoulli gripper, which is an air flow nozzle based device. A computational fluid dynamics model of the air flow generated by a Bernoulli gripper has been developed. This model predicts the air flow, pressure distribution and lifting force generated by the gripper. For thin silicon wafers, the fluid model is combined with a finite element model to analyze the effects of wafer flexibility on the equilibrium pressure distribution, lifting force and handling stresses. The effect of wafer flexibility on the air pressure distribution is found to be increasingly significant at higher air flow rates. The model yields considerable insight into the relative effects of air flow induced vacuum and the direct impingement of air on the wafer on the air pressure distribution, lifting force, and handling stress. The latter effect is found to be especially significant when the wafer deformation is large. In addition to silicon wafers, the model {{can also be used to}} determine the lifting force and handling stress produced in other flexible materials. Finally, a systematic approach for the analysis of the total stress state (handling plus residual stresses) produced in crystalline silicon wafers and its impact on <b>wafer</b> breakage during <b>handling</b> is presented. Results confirm the capability of the approach to predict <b>wafer</b> breakage during <b>handling</b> given the crack size, location and fracture toughness. This methodology is general and can be applied to other thin <b>wafer</b> <b>handling</b> devices besides the Bernoulli gripper. Ph. D.
