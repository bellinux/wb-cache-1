25|$|Terrence Tognolini {{was later}} {{implicated in the}} murder of Vicki Joy Jacobs, a 37-year-old woman who was shot six times as she slept next to her six-year-old son in her {{apartment}} in Long Gully, Bendigo on June 12, 1999. The previous year, Jacobs had given evidence that helped convict her ex-husband Gerald David Preston for the August 1996 murders of drug dealer and mechanic Les Knowles and his employee Tim Richards in Adelaide, and her testimony implicated the Hells Angels in hiring Preston for the killings. The prosecution heard that Tognolini had contracted Preston to murder Knowles who was trying to expand into the Hells Angels' drug territory, and also sold him the Luger pistol that was used in the murders. Victoria Police bulldozed their way into the fortified Thomastown headquarters of the Nomads chapter in July 1999 as part of the investigation, seizing a sawn-off shotgun, bulletproof vest, bags of documents and three motorcycles. Tognolini was overseas and Preston imprisoned at the time of Jacobs' murder <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> been charged with the crime; however, a coronial inquest in 2004 declared that police believe she was killed on the orders of the Hells Angels as a payment for Preston remaining silent over the club's involvement in the Adelaide murders.|$|E
500|$|The Peace Candle is {{believed}} to be the largest non-wax Christmas candle in the United States. Since it was first erected in 1951, Easton city officials have at various times declared it the largest candle in the world. In 1972, city council president Henry Schultz declared, [...] "We claim, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> ever argued with us, that this is the largest candle in the world." [...] However, the Schlitz Christmas Candle, a non-wax candle-like structure in Schlitz, a small town in Hesse, Germany, is larger at [...] tall. The current Peace Candle is taller than the Guinness World Record-holder for tallest candle, which belongs to an [...] tall, [...] wide candle exhibited at the General Art and Industrial Exhibition of Stockholm in 1897. However, only wax candles are eligible for the record, and there is no Guinness World Record for largest non-wax candle. When the third incarnation of the Peace Candle was built in 1990, Easton officials tried unsuccessful to seek a Guinness record for it.|$|E
500|$|Dave Zinkoff, {{the public}} address announcer, began announcing Chamberlain's point total after {{each of his}} baskets. With ten minutes {{to play in the}} game, Warriors forward Tom Meschery sensed the team concept {{breaking}} down. The team's offense had shifted to getting Chamberlain the ball and then stopping and watching instead of cutting and moving without the ball. Chamberlain needed 25points with eight minutes remaining to reach 100, a rate equivalent to 150points in a full game. He scored his 79th point with 7:51 left, breaking his own record and sending the crowd into a frenzy. The 4,124 spectators screamed, [...] "Give it to Wilt! Give it to Wilt!" [...] After he reached 80, the crowd yelled for 100. Chamberlain thought, [...] "Man, these people are tough. I'm tired. I've got 80 points <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> ever scored 80." [...] The Warriors continued giving Chamberlain the ball. Warrior Al Attles later explained, [...] "We wanted that Wilt got the record, because we all liked him." [...] Attles himself led by example, passing up on an easy layup so that Chamberlain could score points 88 and 89, five minutes before the end.|$|E

500|$|Davis {{verbally}} {{committed to}} Kentucky on August 13, 2010, choosing {{it over his}} other finalists, which were DePaul, Ohio State, and Syracuse. He had officially visited DePaul and Ohio State. On August 24, 2010, he became the number one rated player in the national class of 2011 at Scout.com. [...] The pay-for-play scandal had played out very publicly in the press. Before Davis committed to Kentucky, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that his father, Anthony Davis, Sr. asked Kentucky for $200,000 for a commitment from his son. The report was initially released on Wednesday August 4, 2010 by Sun-Times reporter Michael O'Brien. Citing [...] "a reliable source", he posted the following text [...] "rumors/sources that have Davis choosing Kentucky are also alleging that the commitment cost $200,000." [...] before it was edited to say [...] "rumors that Davis' commitment is for sale have surfaced since he cut his list of schools down about a month ago." [...] and then removed later that day from the Sun-Times high school sports website following a threat from a University of Kentucky lawyer. A Lexington, Kentucky law firm sent a letter under the signature of attorney Stephen L. Barker that expressed a [...] "formal demand that you (O'Brien and the Sun-Times) withdraw the publication from any source from which it has been published, and issue an immediate statement that you know of no credible evidence indicating {{that there is any}} truth to the 'rumors' referred to in your article." [...] Baker's letter also threatened potential [...] "punitive damages for your malicious and willful actions." [...] Anthony Davis Sr. declined to speak to the Chicago Tribune on August 4 regarding the allegation, although he denied the allegations to the Sun-Times stating [...] "We haven't asked anyone for anything, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> offered us anything", on July 30 before the story broke.|$|E

Grant had at the time been manager of The Yardbirds.

For his part, Laarbi Maateis denied any involvement with fundamentalist movements, indicating that no member of Tablig had ever been arrested or identified as a suspect in connection with jihadism. He also said the prosecution were not understandable [...] "because the Maliki rite is practiced both here and in the rest of Spain and Morocco <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> tried to change that, especially because {{it seems to be the}} best for the city." ...|$|E

2500|$|Theory of mind is {{a theory}} insofar as the mind {{is the only thing}} being {{directly}} observed. The presumption that others have a mind is termed a theory of mind because each human can only intuit the existence of their own mind through introspection, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> direct access to the mind of another. It is typically assumed that others have minds analogous to one's own, and this assumption is based on the reciprocal, social interaction, as observed in joint attention, the functional use of language, and the understanding of others' emotions and actions. Having theory of mind allows one to attribute thoughts, desires, and intentions to others, to predict or explain their actions, and to posit their intentions. As originally defined, it enables one to understand that mental states can be the cause of—and thus be used to explain and predict—the behavior of others. Being able to attribute mental states to others and understanding them as causes of behavior implies, in part, that one must be able to conceive of the mind as a [...] "generator of representations". If a person does not have a complete theory of mind it may be a sign of cognitive or developmental impairment.|$|E
