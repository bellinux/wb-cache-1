50|$|One of {{the most}} useful {{chemical}} properties of n-BuLi {{is its ability to}} deprotonate a wide range of weak Brønsted acids. t-Butyllithium and s-butyllithium are more basic. n-BuLi can deprotonate (that is, metalate) many types of C-H bonds, especially where the conjugate base is stabilized by electron delocalization or one or more heteroatoms (non carbon atoms). Examples include acetylenes (H-CC-R), methyl sulfides (H-CH2SR), thioacetals (H-CH(SR)2, e.g. dithiane), methylphosphines (H-CH2PR2), furans, thiophenes and ferrocene (Fe(H-C5H4)(C5H5)).

40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) is {{a modern}} separation technique that has some distinct advantages for toxicological analysis, such as a high efficiency, fast analysis, flexibility, and complementary separation mechanisms to chromatographic methods. CE can be applied in various modes, which each have a different separation mechanism or selectivity. The most common mode is capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), in which charged analytes migrate in a buffer {{under the influence of}} an electric field. In micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC), micelles are added to the buffer which interact with the analytes. MEKC can also be used for the separation of neutral compounds. In non-aqueous CE (NACE), the aqueous buffer is replaced by a background of electrolytes in organic solvents. A sample that needs to be screened can easily be analyzed subsequently by these CE modes using the same instrumentation. The aim {{of the study was to}} develop procedures for the analysis of basic and acidic drugs in serum and urine using CZE, MEKC, and NACE. A test mixture that consisted of six basic and six <b>acidic</b> <b>compounds</b> was used to study the separation behavior of five CE methods. The results showed that three methods (based on CZE, MEKC, and NACE) were suitable for the analysis of basic compounds and three methods (based on CZE and MEKC) for the analysis of <b>acidic</b> <b>compounds.</b> For the extraction of analytes from serum and urine, a solid-phase extraction (SPE) and a liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) method were compared. Both SPE and LLE methods provided clean extracts after extraction of the basic compounds from serum and urine. The extracts of <b>acidic</b> <b>compounds</b> contained more matrix interferences, especially for urine. The SPE method had some advantages compared to LLE, as it lead to cleaner extracts and higher peaks, and as it elutes basic and <b>acidic</b> <b>compounds</b> in one fraction. The potentials and pitfalls of the various methods for screening purposes in analytical toxicology are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|The use of alkali {{has proven}} to reduce the {{adsorption}} of anionic surfactants (Hirasaki et al. 2008). Alkali increases the pH and decreases the number of positive sites available for the adsorption on the surface. Sodium carbonate is a conventional alkali used to achieve a low interfacial tension (IFT) by generating in situ surfactants by reacting with <b>acidic</b> <b>compound</b> present in the crude oil. It can also act as a sacrificial agent resulting in the decreased adsorption because it consumes the multivalent cations which would otherwise precipitate with surfactants and cause plugging in rock pores thereby reducing permeability (Grigg et al. 2004; Hirasaki et al. 2008). Another alkali, sodium tetraborate which {{is also known as}} Borax is a novel alkali which can isolate multivalent cations by coordination rather than precipitation. Sodium tetraborate has a high salinity tolerance due to comparatively less ionic strength as compared to sodium metaborate (Lv et al. 2011).|$|E

Frederickson et al.

However, Edwards and Subler (2011) reviewed literatures and stated that vermicomposting process eliminates or suppresses human pathogens. Lazcano et al.

30|$|In cereal grains, {{phytic acid}} (InsP 6) is {{considered}} {{as the major}} source of phosphorus and inositol phosphates. Phytic acid is an <b>acidic</b> <b>compound</b> which is highly reactive and readily binds to divalent mineral cations forming mixed salt complexes known as phytate (Lott et al. 1995). In rice, about 80 % of phytate accumulates in the aleurone layer and embryo of mature seeds (Ogawa et al. 1977), which is degraded by phytase during germination (Laboure et al. 1993; Barrientos et al. 1994). Degradation of phytate mediated by the action of phytase, releases the bound mineral cations, phosphorus and myo-inositol which are required for proper growth and development of seedlings (Raboy 2002). Moreover, the monogastric animals, due to lack of this phytase enzyme, cannot digest phytate efficiently, rendering the bound phosphorus and mineral cations (Fe 2 +, Zn 2 +, Ca 2 +) unavailable for absorption (Bregitzer and Raboy 2006). Therefore, various {{attempts have been made to}} develop low phytate crops which would facilitate improvement in the bioavailability of phosphorus and micronutrients.|$|E

Peptides and small proteins rich in arginine were used as the basic components. The extent of complex formation correlates with the number of phosphate and sulfate groups in the acidic component and with the number of arginines in the basic component. Neither the acidic amino acid residue aspartic and glutamic acid nor the basic lysine and histidine contribute to complex formation.
