In most cases, the animals either healed naturally or died without any treatment, taking into consideration that animal diseases in the past were significantly less frequent than now, as the animals were generally in better health due to increased mobility and a diet that included a wide range of fresh plants. Today, the animals are presenting different types of ailments than in the past. These ailments are generally treated with new chemical-based, rather than plant-based, medicines, either because pharmaceuticals are known to cure the ailments quickly, or because the Badu have not seen these ailments before and therefore do not know what plants to treat them with.|$|E

All these factors can facilitate the interaction of prooxidants with the cellular macromolecules resulting in the generation of free radicals and the propagation of oxidative reactions. The oxidation is a major deterioration reaction which often results in a significant loss of meat product quality. Carnosine and anserine are naturally occurring skeletal muscle dipeptides. Their function is not completely understood, but they are thought to act both as buffering agents and as antioxidants in vitro e in vivo. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the carnosine and anserine content in muscles of conventionally processed young bulls of two different breeds (Charolais and Limousine) raised in 4 different intensive-farms.

Pigs, or rather the mini pig breeds are part of the preclinical testing of drugs in toxicology. In dermatology tend to be an experimental model in the healing wounds and burns, or the study of melanoma. Cardiovascular system of pigs is used in connection with the formation of atherosclerosis and congenital heart defects. The omnivorousness of pigs to test of dietary supplements; is also monitored in experimental diabetes, gastric ulcer or cirrhosis of the liver. Just the liver and their ability to regenerate them is in the laboratory pigs the focus of many research groups around the world. The central nervous system offers the opportunity to study stroke, or spinal cord injury. In transgenic animals is studied Huntington's disease and its treatment in humans. Titanium implants and various types of biomaterials are injected into the skeletal system of a pig, then reactions and bone healing are examined. In the area of experimental xenotransplantation could in the future be strains of genetically modified pigs become a source of organs for humans. While unresolved problem is the HAR-Hyperacute Rejection so rejection of the implant, and the risk of transmission of certain diseases from pigs to humans. Payoff experimental pigs is of undoubted importance and need this potential wisely and purposefully use, without wasting experimental animals and unnecessary pain. Emphasis should be placed on adherence to regulatory compliance and the concept of 3 R. Actual laboratory pigs breeding is at a high standard. Unfortunately, his major weakness on global scale is incomplete reported data related to exact values used pigs in experiments. In the Czech Republic was the most laboratory pigs used in 1994 exactly 6882 pieces, in 1998 has been used 7122 pieces, higher number of laboratory swine was also reported for the year 2009, namely 4445 pieces. In recent years, the numbers of used laboratory pigs in the Czech Republic have settled around an average value of 2, 400 pieces. Using the Mann-Whitney U test were compared to the values used in the laboratory pigs Czech Republic and the European Union, on a per capita basis. From the resulting value of p = 0. 486, bigger than alpha = 0. 05 it follows, that was not proved a difference in the use of experimental pigs between the Czech Republic and the other member states of the European Union.

Blood samples were taken from 15 cystic Holstein cows and 15 healthy ones. Samples were taken from their tail veins using a venoject tube and the then sera were extracted by centrifugation. Blood concentrations of E 2, BUN and Cu in cystic cows were significantly higher (P 0. 05).

In this study, we developed a probe-based quantitative gene expression assay for immunological assessment of captive beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) {{that is one of}} the most common cetacean species on display in aquariums worldwide. Six immunologically relevant genes (IL- 2 Rα, - 4, - 10, - 12, TNFα, and IFNγ) were selected for analysis, and two validated housekeeping genes (PGK 1 and RPL 4) with stable expression were used as reference genes. Sixteen blood samples were obtained from four <b>animals</b> with different <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> and stored in RNAlater™ solution. These samples were used for RNA extraction followed by qRT-PCR analysis. Analysis of gene transcripts was performed by relative quantitation using the comparative Cq method with the integration of amplification efficiency and two reference genes.

Transcript outliers for IL- 2 Rα, IL- 4, IL- 12, TNFα, and IFNγ were noticed in four samples collected from two clinically unhealthy animals.

In the production of suckler cows only a few problems were identified; the main obstacle to further development of organic cattle rearing {{was considered to be}} the low prices paid to producers. A further study looked at what preventive measures against the major disease groups of mastitis, lameness, metabolic disorders were used in organic dairy farming, collected data on the actual <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> situation and developed preventive <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> concepts that were made available to advisory services. In the same period, a study of the effect of homeopathic remedies for mastitis in dairy cows showed that the use of dry-cow antibiotics can be reduced, but their use cannot be fully eliminated in problem cases. Another status analysis from 2003 to 2004 focused on the state of knowledge on issues such as mastitis, fertility, metabolism and claw disorders in dairy cows and selected diseases in pigs and poultry. The surveys showed that the <b>health</b> status of <b>animals</b> in the organic livestock was not signifi-cantly different from that in conventional animal production and that there was a relatively high inci-dence rate, regardless of the production method. Between 2004 and 2005, a vulnerability assess-ment of the acute need for improvement focusing on small ruminants was carried out, leading to various recommendations. In 2007, building on the previous results, a large, interdisciplinary collaborative project on the health and performance of dairy cows was set up. At the same time the CORE Organic project on health planning for dairy cows (ANIPLAN) was running (also in the UK).
