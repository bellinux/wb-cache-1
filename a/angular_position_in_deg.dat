Flankers varied <b>in</b> contrast, orientation, <b>angular</b> <b>position,</b> and sign. Rats are impaired at detecting visual targets with collinear flankers, compared to configurations where flankers differ from the target <b>in</b> orientation or <b>angular</b> <b>position.</b> <b>In</b> particular, rats {{are more likely to}} miss the target when flankers are collinear. The same impairment is found even when the flanker luminance was sign-reversed relative to the target. These findings suggest that contour alignment alters visual processing in rats, despite their lack of orientation columns in visual cortex. This is the first report that the arrangement of visual features relative to each other affects visual behavior in rats. To provide a conceptual framework for our findings, we relate our stimuli to a contrast normalization model of early visual processing. We suggest a pattern-sensitive generalization of the model which could account for a collinear deficit.
