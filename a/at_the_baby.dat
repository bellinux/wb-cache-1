5|$|As Jerry is {{sleeping}} on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer, who apparently has ratted out Jerry. When Jerry protests that {{he had nothing to}} do with it, they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This jolts him awake. He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot go back to his apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On the way out of the bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the picture tube of his television set.|$|E
25|$|A lesser known {{story from}} the Brahma Vaivarta Purana narrates a {{different}} version of Ganesha's birth. On the insistence of Shiva, Parvati fasted for a year (punyaka vrata) to propitiate Vishnu {{so that he would}} grant her a son. Vishnu, after the completion of the sacrifice, announced that he would incarnate himself as her son in every kalpa (eon). Accordingly, Ganesha was born to Parvati as a charming infant. This event was celebrated with great enthusiasm and all the gods were invited to take a look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> However Shani (Saturn), the son of Surya, hesitated to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> since Shani was cursed with the gaze of destruction. However Parvati insisted that he look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> which Shani did, and immediately the infant's head fell off. Seeing Shiva and Parvati grief-stricken, Vishnu mounted on Garuda, his divine eagle, and rushed to the banks of the Pushpa-Bhadra river, from where he brought back the head of a young elephant. The head of the elephant was joined with the headless body of Parvati's son, thus reviving him. The infant was named Ganesha and all the Gods blessed Ganesha and wished Him power and prosperity.|$|E

50|$|After being {{discharged}} from the military, McIntosh worked as a pathology assistant <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Boston City Hospital. Moving to New York City, he became a medical intern at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and a pediatric intern and resident <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Babies</b> Hospital (now Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital). He worked {{in private practice in}} New York from 1923 and 1927, before relocating to Baltimore to take up a position <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Johns Hopkins Hospital under the pediatrician Edwards A. Park. In 1930, he returned to work at NewYork-Presbyterian, where he was appointed chief of pediatrics <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Babies</b> Hospital and made a professor at Columbia University. He married Millicent Carey McIntosh in 1932; the couple had five children.|$|R
50|$|Rustin McIntosh (September 29, 1894 - February 14, 1986) was an American pediatrician.

25|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} pre-eclampsia is {{the delivery of}} the baby and placenta. The timing of delivery should balance the desire for optimal outcomes for the baby while reducing risks for the mother. The severity of disease and the maturity of the baby are primary considerations. These considerations are situation-specific and management will vary with situation, location, and institution. Treatment can range from expectant management to expedited delivery by induction of labor or Caesarian section, in addition to medications. Important in management is {{the assessment of the}} mothers organ systems, management of severe hypertension, and prevention and treatment of eclamptic seizures. Separate interventions directed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> may also be necessary. Bed rest has not been found to be useful and is thus not routinely recommended.|$|E

500|$|... "Sometimes" [...] {{attained}} worldwide success, peaking {{inside the}} top ten in eleven countries. In the United States, the song peaked at number twenty one. The song reached number one in Belgium (Flanders), Netherlands and New Zealand, while reaching number two in Australia. In the United Kingdom, the song reached number three, and is also Spears' third best-selling single in the country. An accompanying music video, directed by Nigel Dick, was shot at the Paradise Cove in Malibu, California. It portrays Spears watching her love interest from afar. Spears has performed [...] "Sometimes" [...] in four of her concert tours, including <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ...<b>Baby</b> One More Time Tour (1999), the Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour (2000–01), and the Dream Within a Dream Tour (2001–02).|$|E

60|$|She {{could see}} nursemaids {{wheeling}} <b>babies</b> towards <b>the</b> Gardens, and noted their faces gazing, not <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>babies,</b> but, uppishly, <b>at</b> other nursemaids, or, {{with a sort}} of cautious longing, at men who passed.

500|$|... "The Baby Shower" [...] {{was first}} {{read by the}} show's cast on November 14, 1990. It was filmed {{in front of a}} live {{audience}} on November 20. A technique called [...] "Poor Man's Process" [...] was used during the car scene with George and Jerry; one or two crew members would shake the car {{to give the impression that}} it was moving, though it never actually was. Other crew members would move lights around the set to simulate street lights or headlights of other cars. Behind the car, two lights on a wheeled stand were placed to give the impression that there was a car behind it. A cheap plastic sticker was put on Jerry's television screen to give the impression that it was broken. A number of scenes were changed or cut during production of the episode. In early drafts of the script, the episode opened with Kramer telling Jerry about the Russian cable installers. In the first draft of the script Elaine and Jerry would realize ahead of time that the baby shower and the cable installation would take place at the same time. This was changed as the writers felt it would be better left as a surprise. Some dialogue was removed from the scene, as Kramer initially told Jerry Benjamin Franklin would have wanted free cable. Additional dialogue between the baby shower guests regarding turning off men was also cut. The scene in which Mary Cantardi, a woman Jerry went out with once but never called afterwards, makes a scene <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> shower was not in the original script, but was added during rehearsals to give Seinfeld more involvement in the final scene.|$|E
2500|$|Although she was {{originally}} named after Saint Mary of Graces, Xuxa, {{the youngest member}} of the Meneghel family, received the nickname by which she came to be known from her brother, Bladimir. When their mother arrived home, she said to him: [...] "Look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> that I bought to play with you." [...] To this, he replied: [...] "I know, it's my Xuxa." [...] The nickname stuck, though it was not until 1988 that she officially became Maria da Graça Xuxa Meneghel.|$|E
2500|$|The {{painting}} shows {{a fairly}} conventional depiction {{of this very}} common scene, with some unusual details. [...] The number of shepherds is rather large at nine, and the pose of the shepherd pointing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> Jesus while {{looking over his shoulder}} outside the picture space suggests that more are arriving. Or possibly he has seen the approaching Magi, the next arrivals in the traditional narrative. [...] Saint Joseph, often a rather superfluous figure in paintings of the Nativity, is shown making himself useful by carrying hay, presumably to feed the ox and ass, in the background, so filling a gap in the composition, and perhaps distracting them from joining in with the bagpipe music. The relegation of the ox and ass to a dimly-lit background is typical of 17th century compositions.|$|E
