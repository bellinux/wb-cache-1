40|$|Soft elastic layers {{with top}} and bottom {{surfaces}} adhered to rigid bodies are abundant in biological organisms and engineering applications. As the rigid bodies are pulled apart, the stressed layer can exhibit various modes of mechanical instabilities. In cases where the layer's thickness is much smaller than its length and width, the dominant modes that have been studied are the cavitation, interfacial and fingering instabilities. Here we report a new mode of instability which emerges if the thickness of the constrained elastic layer is comparable to or smaller than its width. In this case, the middle portion along the layer's thickness elongates nearly uniformly while the constrained fringe portions of the layer deform nonuniformly. When the applied stretch reaches a critical value, the exposed free surfaces of the fringe portions begin to undulate periodically without debonding from the rigid bodies, giving the fringe instability. We use experiments, theory and numerical simulations to quantitatively explain the fringe instability and derive scaling laws for its critical stress, critical strain and wavelength. We show that in a force controlled setting the elastic fingering instability is associated with a snap-through buckling that does not exist for the fringe instability. The discovery of the fringe instability will not only advance the understanding of mechanical instabilities in soft materials but also have implications for biological and engineered <b>adhesives</b> <b>and</b> <b>joints.</b> United States.

40|$|For {{toughened}} <b>and</b> flexible <b>adhesives</b> it {{is found}} that a simple prediction model for overlap joints can be used to calculate the ultimate strength for the static load case. The absolute maximum strength for a lap joint is when the whole of the adhesive layer is at the shear yield strength. An additional requirement regards yielding of the connecting substrates. The model is validated for a variety of <b>adhesives</b> <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> geometries. To apply this simple prediction model for practical application, the partial (safety) factor has to be calibrated. With use of the probabilistic techniques this process is illustrated for a number of adhesives.

A disadvantage of mechanical connections such as bolts, screws or rivets {{is that they}} do not uniformly distribute the load; hence large local stresses result.

The effects of water, temperature and chemicals on the <b>adhesive</b> <b>and</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>joints</b> are investigated. Stainless steel plates are pretreated with a primer and isopropanol, there after joined together with single lap modeling. The strength of the joint is tested with a tensile test and additionally a watertightness test is performed {{to determine if the}} joints are watertight. For this project three versions of stainless steels is used and two different technologies of two- part <b>adhesives,</b> silicone <b>and</b> silane-modified polymer and one technology of tape, a double coated acrylic foam tape are tested. The result shows that all the <b>adhesives</b> fails cohesively <b>and</b> that tape fails partly adhesively. Result shows that all tests are affected by water, temperature and chemicals on different levels but tape is affected the most with a minimum of 40 % loss in shear strength. Watertightness test shows that aged tape joints are not watertight. The polymer shows no signs of decreasing in shear strength and is watertight, but does become more viscous by aging. The report shows that a possible combination of <b>adhesive</b> <b>and</b> pretreatment that can withstand the effects of water, temperature and chemicals is found. The polymer presents a possibility to bond stainless steel with a simple pretreatment.

After drilling joints of 75 º, 78 º, 81 º, 84 º, and 87 º degrees on Oriental beech, European oak, Scotch pine, and MDF samples, a diagonal tensile test was applied on corners glued with polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) and polyurethane (D-VTKA = Desmodur-Vinyl Trieketonol Acetate) according to ASTM D 1037 standard.

40|$|A mesh-independent {{continuum}} damage {{model has}} been proposed to predict the residual strength of adhesively-bonded joints by introducing a displacement-based damage parameter into the constitutive equation of the damaged materials. This approach was originally developed for EA 9321 -bonded single-lap <b>joints</b> <b>and</b> this paper extends it to butt joints bonded with a different ductile adhesive (E 32). This involves not only a different <b>adhesive</b> <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> configuration but the high hydrostatic stress requires a more realistic yielding model. A dry and a partially saturated steel joint were used to calibrate the moisture dependent damage parameters of the <b>adhesive</b> E 32, <b>and</b> then these parameters were used without further modification to predict {{the failure of the}} other environmentally degraded steel butt <b>joints</b> <b>and</b> the aluminum butt joints. The FEA package ABAQUS was used to implement the coupled mechanical-diffusion analyses required. A von Mises yield model was used initially. Then, a linear Drucker-Prager plasticity model was used, as this could incorporate the hydrostatic stress dependency found in the adhesive. The predicted joint residual strengths agreed well with the corresponding experimental data, which exhibited a significant reduction in strength on exposure to moisture but still retained a cohesive failure mode in the adhesive.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model {{to study the}} coupled transverse and longitudinal vibrations of a single lap adhesive joint is proposed in this paper which includes partial differential form of the motion equations. A balanced single lap adhesive joint consist of two identical adherents of mild steel which are lap jointed over a certain length by a viscoelastic material, epoxy resin(araldite). Adherents are modeled as Euler-Bernoulli Free-Free beam. Both transverse and axial deformation of adherents, shear and peel stresses at the <b>adhesive</b> <b>joint</b> interface <b>and</b> deflection of mid plane of adhesive layer (3 -parameter model) is considered in deriving the equations of motion.

The governing equations of motions are derived for three parameter elastic foundation model. The numerical solutions of the governing equations for free vibrations yield the system natural frequency.
