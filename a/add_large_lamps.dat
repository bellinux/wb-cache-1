60|$|The {{lights were}} lit after that, and kept burning brightly {{all through the}} long winter--one <b>large</b> <b>lamp</b> {{on the deck of}} the Ice King, and another equally large in front of the hut on shore. Smaller lamps were {{likewise}} kept burning constantly indoors.|$|R
60|$|It was {{certainly}} {{a fact that the}} <b>large</b> <b>lamp</b> which illuminated the staircase now burned dim and duskily; so that several figures which passed hastily down the stairs and went forth from the porch appeared rather like shadows than persons of fleshly substance.|$|R
60|$|In {{spite of}} my disappointment, I {{was glad to be}} in a warm house, and hoped {{we might be able to}} stay there. I could hear the storm beating furiously against the window-panes behind the drawn shades. There was a stove in the sitting-room, and a <b>large</b> <b>lamp.</b>|$|R
50|$|The lamps are {{becoming}} variable {{in shape and}} distribution. We still find lamps similar to the Late Bronze period. In addition, other forms evolve, such as small lamps with a flat base and <b>larger</b> <b>lamps</b> with a round base. The later form continues into the Iron Age II.|$|R
5000|$|A stone {{relief that}} shows two men sitting on chairs across a table from one another. The men are each {{reading a book}} and a <b>large</b> <b>lamp</b> sits on the table between the two men. The relief was {{installed}} in a semicircular space above {{the entrance to the}} building.|$|R
50|$|Westfriedhof is an U-Bahn {{station in}} Munich on the U1 {{line of the}} Munich U-Bahn system, it opened on 24 May 1998, the {{extension}} onwards to Georg-Brauchle-Ring was completed in 2003. 11 <b>large</b> <b>lamps</b> measuring 3.80 metres in diameter were installed in 2001 and bathe the station in blue, red and yellow light.|$|R
50|$|In May 1929 two <b>large</b> <b>lamps</b> {{mounted on}} a tripod toppled over on a sound stage where Burgess {{was working at the}} Fox Movietone Studio. She was cut {{severely}} over her left eye by one of the incandescent lamps. Burgess was rushed to a studio hospital where several stitches were taken in her wound.|$|R
6000|$|For every {{tiny town}} or place [...] God made the stars especially; [...] Babies look up with owlish face [...] And see them tangled in a tree: [...] You saw a moon from Sussex Downs, [...] A Sussex moon, untravelled still, [...] I saw a moon {{that was the}} town's, [...] The <b>largest</b> <b>lamp</b> on Campden Hill.|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosed}} {{area of the}} haveli was 24,000 sq.ft (2,230 sq. meters) which consisted of four stories {{with a total of}} 45 rooms. The rooms had large windows and were lit on evenings by <b>large</b> <b>lamps</b> and chandeliers. The embellishments and the wooden decoration of the haveli borrowed a lot from Central Asian and European architectures.|$|R
5000|$|In the center, a <b>large</b> <b>lamp</b> is {{hung from}} a rope. The chandelier, also called a [...] (crown) or {{circular}} chandelier, hung in the nave until 1944, when it was removed {{to protect it from}} bombing. It hung above the altar in the crossing from the reopening of the cathedral in 1960 to 2010, when cathedral restoration work began.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{additions}} to the decorations have been made since St. Patrick's completion, first in 1922 by Guido Nincheri and again in 1931 by Victor Marion. The <b>large</b> <b>lamp</b> hanging in the sanctuary is unique in North America. Weighing 1800 pounds, (815 kg), it was installed in 1896. Each of the six angels on the pedestal stands 2 m high.|$|R
5000|$|Lamp bulbs with dual (carbon) {{filaments}} {{were built}} {{as early as}} 1902 to allow adjustable lighting levels. <b>Large</b> <b>lamps</b> of 500-watt rating were used for street lighting in France, which had a second filament at 200 watts to reduce lighting costs. In 1933 in the United States, Westinghouse announced a dual-filament lamp for commercial lighting and a smaller lamp for residential use.|$|R

50|$|General Electric Company Building, Buffalo, New York (1912; new {{lighting}} scheme 1927): multi-level floodlights, purple {{lights on}} tower, revolving searchlights. One {{of the first}} color lighting schemes, {{and one of the}} first to use <b>large</b> <b>lamps</b> instead of outlining with many small ones. Often lit in particular colors for seasonal and other special displays. Building design: Esenwein & Johnson. Lighting design Walter D'Arcy Ryan.|$|R
50|$|At {{the top of}} the {{building}} a <b>large,</b> solar-powered <b>lamp</b> visible from across the city was planned.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{automobiles}} parked on Hill Street, looking north from Seventh Street in Los Angeles, ca. 1920. Automobiles line {{the sides of}} the road, while others amble down the street. A large sidewalk strip is visible at left, and the street is lined with <b>large</b> <b>lamps</b> bearing the American flag. Wires criss-cross above the road, while buildings of varying heights are visible {{on both sides of the}} thoroughfare...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the "Dummy" line (?), a San Diego and Pacific Beach {{railroad}} car, ca. 1890. Several {{men can be}} seen posing {{near the}} car behind the caboose. The caboose (at left) appears {{to be filled with}} passengers. A bell and a <b>large</b> <b>lamp</b> sits on top of the car behind the caboose. Painted on the rear car is " 1 " and "S. D. &. P. B. Ry. "...|$|R
6000|$|It {{had been}} {{arranged}} that the Esquimaux {{and some of}} the sailors were to live on shore, while Barwell Dawson and his party, and the captain and engineer and two others, remained on the steamer. Thus all had more [...] "elbow room" [...] than if they had crowded the entire party in one place or the other. From the hold of the vessel several <b>large</b> <b>lamps</b> were produced and put into readiness for use.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have noticed}} it, then?" [...] she said. [...] "It comes also from my father's fears. He {{does not like}} to have one dark corner in the whole house. He walks about a good deal at night, and {{inspects}} everything, from the attics {{right down to the}} cellars. He has <b>large</b> <b>lamps</b> in every room and corridor, even the empty ones, and he orders the servants to light them all at dusk." ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} view of Stockton Post Office, ca. 1900. The two-story, stone building {{stands at}} center with columns and <b>large</b> <b>lamps</b> {{in front of}} its entrance. Awnings reach out over the front windows and an American flag waves on a pole above the roof. A horse-drawn carriage {{sits in front of}} the sidewalk. A second building can be seen down the street in the right background while trees stand in the left background...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{four men}} {{on the front of}} a Los Angeles Junction Railway Company {{locomotive}}, [s. d. ]. The steam locomotive is at center and four men in overalls can be seen standing {{on the front of the}} engine. The number 200 appears on the front of the engine, directly below a <b>large</b> <b>lamp.</b> Several sets of railroad tracks can be seen in the foreground, and several boxcars can be seen at left...|$|R
50|$|Pressure was {{provided}} by a hand-worked stirrup pump on the tank. Once pressurised, a <b>large</b> <b>lamp</b> could burn for some hours before the pressure fell enough to require more pumping. A particular feature of the Wells design was that the tank could be refilled whilst the lamp was still burning (i.e. without releasing the pressure in the tank) by using this same pressurisation pump as a fuel pump to suck in oil from another container.|$|R
50|$|Version with <b>added</b> <b>large</b> centrimetric radar unit, {{introduced}} in 1943.|$|R
50|$|Body changed {{compared}} to earlier models to accommodate <b>larger</b> rear <b>lamps,</b> rear seat area modified to give room for new torque converter.|$|R
6000|$|Both of {{the young}} ladies were in the parlour when Corey entered with their father, and both were frankly {{indifferent}} to the few books and the many newspapers scattered about on the table where the <b>large</b> <b>lamp</b> was placed. But after Corey had greeted Irene {{he glanced at the}} novel under his eye, and said, in the dearth that sometimes befalls people at such times: [...] "I see you're reading Middlemarch. Do you like George Eliot?" ...|$|R
50|$|As an executive, Morrison ensured the {{management}} and enforcement of GE's patents. On April 28, 1926 Morrison wrote to Gerard Swope, president of GE at the time, to bring attention to the early expiration of three vital patents covering the tungsten lamp, upon which GE's market share virtually completely rested. Morrison went on to acknowledge that cross-patent licensing agreements with Westinghouse, GE's <b>largest</b> <b>lamp</b> manufacturing competitor, was essential to prevent other competitors from gaining share of General Electric's markets.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} {{the altar}} inside the Kong Chew Temple in Los Angeles's old Chinatown, November 1933. The large altar can be seen at center and is ornately {{decorated}} with gold etchings. A <b>large</b> <b>lamp</b> can be seen next to the altar at left, while a table is visible in front of it. Several Chinese characters appear {{on the back of the}} altar. At left, a small wooden chair with a carved back is visible...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{the main}} {{auditorium}} of the Church of Nativity, in Bethlehem, Palestine, ca. 1900 - 1910.

A row of <b>large</b> <b>lamps</b> suspend from the ceiling, hovering above the short stair leading up to what appears to be an altar area. The wooden beams of the high ceiling appear overhead, atop the walls lined with arched windows...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{lighthouse}} on {{the site}} was built in 1839-40. This timber structure was replaced with a square bluestone lighthouse tower, designed by Henry Ginn. The bluestone section has battered lower stories featuring rusticated masonry with smooth string courses and originally had a castellated parapet with mast and spherical, copper plate timeball above. The masonry was quarried and worked by prisoner labour. Four lamps were shining in May 1849; a <b>larger</b> <b>lamp</b> was installed in August 1849.|$|R
25|$|The {{local police}} turned {{up during the}} middle of a {{rehearsal}} demanding immediate payment of a fine; the residents who lived nearby were complaining of excessive noise and were exhausted from their sleepless nights. Also, FBI officers threatened {{to put a stop to}} the whole proceedings because they were being deprived of electricity. 30 <b>large</b> <b>lamps</b> had been installed on top of FBI headquarters, and they were causing problems with their surveillance of Colonel Gaddafi, who was visiting the city at that time.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{windsock}} {{hanging from}} {{the right of the}} end of a metal tower on an unidentified airport, ca. 1927. Beneath the tower sits {{what appears to be a}} water tank, in front of which is a light-colored structure with a single door. A metal ladder is built into the tower and extends to the top, where a box-like structure surrounds what could be a <b>large</b> <b>lamp.</b> In the background lies a flat piece of land behind a wire fence...|$|R
