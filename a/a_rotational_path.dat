40|$|The {{provision}} of removable partial dentures remains a viable treatment modality for many partially dentate patients. Replacing missing anterior teeth with a removable partial denture using <b>a</b> <b>rotational</b> <b>path</b> of insertion provides improved retention and appearance. The use of <b>a</b> <b>rotational</b> <b>path</b> of insertion also provides additional retention for a removable partial denture restoring combined anterior and posterior bounded saddles.

40|$|AbstractThe famous four-colour {{problem of}} planar maps is equivalent, by an optimally fast reduction, {{to the problem}} of {{colouring}} pairs of binary trees (CPBT). Extant proofs of the four colour theorem lack conciseness, are not lucid in their detail and require hours of electronic computation. The search for a more satisfactory proof continues and, in this spirit, we explore one approach to CPBT based upon the rotation operation in binary trees. We prove that a more satisfactory proof exists if <b>a</b> <b>rotational</b> <b>path</b> between the two trees of every problem instance satisfies our non-colour-clashing sequence conjecture...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND. Though implant {{dentistry}} is {{very successful}} and predictable in treatment {{of patients with}} destroyed dentition, there are some cases with limitations to implant therapy. In these cases, alternative treatment modality should be considered. CASE DESCRIPTION. A patient with destroyed dentition was rehabilitated with a lateral rotational path removable partial denture. According to the diagnosis, we determined to raise vertical dimension for esthetic and functional restoration. The final restoration was performed after four months of provisional period. CLINICAL IMPLICATION. The edentulous patients with compromised esthetics and functions can be successfully treated with <b>a</b> <b>rotational</b> <b>path</b> removable partial denture through adequate treatment planning and precise laboratory procedure.

40|$|Background: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} the effect of the location of the rotational center and the morphology of teeth resulting in interference with the <b>rotational</b> <b>path</b> of insertion and to estimate when an interference test should be performed. Methods: A total of 400 dental radiograms of maxillary and mandibular first and second molars (100 for each position) were selected. The radiograms were used to hand-sketch the outlines on tracing paper. Then, an interference test was simulated using calipers. Mesial long occlusal rest seats with three different lengths were designed. <b>A</b> curve-simulated <b>rotational</b> <b>path</b> was drawn on the tracing paper showing the outline of a molar. If the curve was intersected by the mesial outline, interference was occurred. A total of 1200 tests were performed. Results: A significant number of interference cases (18. 5 %, N =  400) occurred when the rotational center was placed at the most distal margin of the occlusal surface. The interference was reduced (2. 75 %, N =  400) but still present at the distal fourth of the occlusal surface. At the distal one-third of the occlusal surface, interference did not occur (0 %, N =  400). There was {{a significant difference between the}} results of the three rotational centers (p <  0. 0001). Conclusions: The interference test was not required for <b>a</b> <b>rotational</b> center at the distal third to half of the occlusal surface. However, if the length of the long occlusal rest extends beyond the distal third, an interference test is recommended before final impression...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The crystallographic orientations of calcite in tectonites {{from the}} Morcles Nappe and the Glarus Overthrust have been {{measured}} by X-ray texture goniometry. The orientation data are represented bypole figures, inverse pole figures and as orientation distribution functions. The patterns of preferred orientation ~observed in the specimens from the Morcles Nappe are correlated with intracrystalline slip mechanisms. The patterns exhibit quasi-axial symmetry {{and in some}} cases the axis of symmetry isoblique to the symmetry of the macroscopic fabric. This obliquity is interpreted as the result of <b>a</b> <b>rotational</b> strain <b>path</b> and may be used to infer direction and sense of shear. Some specimens of the Lochseiten mylonite from the Glarus Thrust how no strong preferred crystallographic orientation. This suggests hat grain boundary sliding was the major deformation mechanism. The crystallographic orientation (texture) of experimentally deformed limestones has been measured by X-ray methods for specimens de...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{designing}} partial prostheses with <b>rotational</b> <b>path</b> of insertion has been debated for years but most dentists {{do not consider}} this treatment method. In conventional partial prostheses, the rests have a single path of insertion while in <b>rotational</b> <b>path</b> of insertion, first the center of rotation sits in the rest then the prosthesis is roated and inserted in final position. In <b>rotational</b> <b>path</b> of insertion prostheses, a rigid retainer is needed as well as conventional clasps. The rigid retainer is inserted in undesirable undercut areas that are not used in conventional method. In current study, methods of rotational partial prostheses {{as well as their}} advantages and disadvantages are introduced and discussed...|$|R
40|$|It can be esthetically {{and financially}} {{daunting}} for patients to lose teeth in an anterior {{region of the}} mouth. For these patients, traditional treatment options presented {{in the past have}} included fixed partial denture, implants, and conventional removable partial denture (RPD). For patients faced with financial, anatomical, and/or esthetic limitations, the edentulous region can be restored successfully with <b>a</b> <b>rotational</b> <b>path</b> RPD. Rotational path RPD designs have often been overlooked by the dental profession due to its complex concepts involving the prosthetic design and sensitive laboratory techniques. With better understanding of the concepts and design, the dental clinician can deliver the highest esthetic outcome in compromised areas in which other treatment options may often face limitations. This paper reviews the method used to esthetically design and plan a posterior-anterior rotational path RPD in an edentulous mandibular anterior region for a patient missing the mandibular incisors. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Due to inadequate understanding of the mechanics of rotational path RPDs, many clinicians have not adapted the application of this advantageous prosthesis. When correctly designed and fabricated, the rotational path RPD provides improved esthetics, cleanliness, and retention for patients who may not be suitable candidates for implants or fixed partial dentures in tooth-supported edentulous regions.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{emphasis on}} physical appearance in contemporary society has increased the demand for esthetic dental restorations. Although the success of implant dentistry has expanded the scope of esthetic fixed prostheses, many patients demand a removable partial denture (RPD) for health, anatomic, psychological, or financial reasons. Fabricating an esthetically pleasing RPD while avoiding the unsightly display associated with conventional clasp assemblies often presents a challenge to dentists. This article examines using lingual clasps, proximal undercuts (also known as <b>rotational</b> <b>path</b> insertion), and acetal resin clasps as simple and effective means of improving RPD esthetics. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present methods to {{smoothly}} interpolate orientations, given N rotational key frames {{of an object}} along a trajectory. The methods allow the user to impose constraints on the <b>rotational</b> <b>path,</b> such as the angular velocity at the endpoints of the trajectory. We convert the rotations to quaternions, and then spline in that non-Euclidean space. Analogous to the mathematical foundations of flat-space spline curves, we minimize the net “tangential acceleration” of the quaternion path. We replace the flat-space quantities with curved-space quantities, and numerically solve the resulting equation with finite difference and optimization methods...|$|R
