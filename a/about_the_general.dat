5|$|In 2004–05, {{researchers}} from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, 268Db, as a fivefold alpha decay {{product of the}} newly created element 115. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow chemical experimentation. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer {{was removed from the}} surface of the target (with dubnium on it), dissolved in aqua regia with tracers and lanthanum carrier, from which precipitated various +3, +4, and +5 species on adding ammonium hydroxide. The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, in which it was converted to nitrate form then dried on a film and counted. It mostly contained a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, but also a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further at both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium in that experiment appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and not even once in niobium-only fractions. However, it was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> chemical profile of dubnium.|$|E

25|$|The second {{aspect of}} the Fermi paradox is the {{argument}} of probability: given intelligent life's ability to overcome scarcity, and its tendency to colonize new habitats, it seems possible {{that at least some}} civilizations would be technologically advanced, seek out new resources in space, and colonize their own star system and, subsequently, surrounding star systems. Since there is no significant evidence on Earth, or elsewhere in the known universe of other intelligent life after 13.8billion years of the universe's history, there is a conflict requiring a resolution.

Capra adored the script and disregarded the risk of making a film that broke California's (and 29 other states') laws concerning the portrayal of miscegenation.

In 1952–53, the US and Soviet Union detonated their first thermonuclear weapons (hydrogen bombs), far more powerful than the atomic bombs tested and deployed since 1945. In 1954, the US Castle Bravo test at Bikini Atoll (part of Operation Castle) had a yield of 15 megatons of TNT, more than doubling the expected yield. The Castle Bravo test resulted in the worst radiological event in US history as radioactive particles spread over more than , affected inhabited areas (including Rongelap Atoll and Utirik Atoll), and sickened Japanese fishermen aboard the Lucky Dragon upon whom [...] "ashes of death" [...] had rained. In the same year, a Soviet test sent radioactive particles over Japan. Around the same time, victims of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima visited the US for medical care, which attracted significant public attention. In 1961, the Soviet Union tested the Tsar Bomba, which had a yield of 50 megatons and remains the most powerful man-made explosion in history, though due to a highly efficient detonation fallout was relatively limited. Between 1951 and 1958, the US conducted 166 atmospheric tests, the Soviet Union conducted 82, and Britain conducted 21; only 22 underground tests were conducted in this period (all by the US).|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} setbacks of 1707 {{continued through}} the opening months of 1708 with the defection of Brugge and Gent to the French. Marlborough remained despondent <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> situation, but his optimism received a major boost with the arrival in theatre of Prince Eugene, his co-commander at Blenheim. Heartened by the Prince's robust confidence, Marlborough set about to regain the strategic initiative. After a forced march, the Allies crossed the river Schelde at Oudenaarde just as the French army, under Marshal Vendôme and the duc de Burgundy, was crossing farther north {{with the intent of}} besieging the place. Marlborough – with renewed self-assurance – moved decisively to engage them. His subsequent victory at the Battle of Oudenaarde on 11 July 1708 demoralised the French army in Flanders; his eye for ground, his sense of timing and his keen knowledge of the enemy were again amply demonstrated. The success, aided by the dissension of the two French commanders, restored the strategic initiative to the Allies, who now opted to besiege Lille, the strongest fortress in Europe. While the Duke commanded the covering force, Eugene oversaw the siege of the town, which surrendered on 22 October; however, it was not until 10 December that the resolute Boufflers yielded the citadel. Yet for all the difficulties of the winter siege, the campaign of 1708 had been a remarkable success, requiring superior logistical skill and organisation. The Allies re-took Brugge and Gent, and the French were driven out of almost all the Spanish Netherlands: [...] "He who has not seen this", wrote Eugene, [...] "has seen nothing".|$|E

500|$|In the late-1980s, 1990s and 2000s ideological, postcolonial and Marxist {{criticism}} dominated Austen studies. Generating heated debate, Edward Said {{devoted a}} chapter of his book Culture and Imperialism (1993) to Mansfield Park, arguing that the peripheral position of [...] "Antigua" [...] {{and the issue of}} slavery demonstrated that colonial oppression was an unspoken assumption of English society during the early 19th century. The question of whether Mansfield Park justifies or condemns slavery has become heated in Austen scholarship, and Said's claims have proved to be highly controversial. The debate about Mansfield Park and slavery is the one issue that in Austen scholarship that has transcended the limits of academia to attract widespread public attention. Many of Austen's critics come from the field of post-colonial studies, and taken up Said's thesis about Mansfield Park reflecting the [...] "spatial" [...] understanding of the world that he argued was used to justify the British empire. Writing in a post-colonial vein, Carl Plasa in his 2001 essay [...] "'What Was Done There Is Not To Be Told' Mansfield Parks Colonial Unconscious" [...] argued that the [...] "barbarism" [...] of Maria Bertram's sexuality, which leads her into adultery, is a metaphor for the [...] "barbarism" [...] of the Haitian revolution, which attracted much media attention in Britain at the time, which was often presented as due to the [...] "barbarism" [...] and uncontrolled sexuality of the Haitian slaves. Plasa argued that British society in Austen's time was based upon set of expectations about everyone being in their [...] "place", which created order. The Haitian revolution was seen as a symbol of what happened to a society without order, and Plasa argued that it was not accident that when Sir Thomas Bertram leaves Mansfield Park for his plantation in Antigua that his family falls apart, showing the importance of the family and individuals staying in their proper [...] "place". Likewise, Maaja Stewart in her 1993 book Domestic Realities and Imperial Fictions argued that the plantations in the Caribbean were the source of much worry about female sexuality in Austen's time with the main concerns being the need of slave owners to depend upon the fertility of slave women to create more slaves when the slave trade was abolished in 1807, and <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> collapse of traditional English morality in the West Indies as the slave masters routinely kept harems of slave women or alternatively raped female slaves. Stewart linked these concerns to Mansfield Park, writing that Sir Thomas Bertram's failure to manage his own family is put down to his failure to manage the emerging sexuality of his teenage daughters, which is precisely the same charge that was applied to the owners of the plantations in the West Indies at the same time.|$|E
