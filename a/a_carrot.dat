5|$|It is a {{piece of}} public art, an {{advertising}} sign, a retail kiosk selling newspapers and hot food, as well as a bus shelter. It has been criticised by local residents who liken it to <b>a</b> <b>carrot</b> or a space ship, although it is meant to symbolise man's harmony with the sea. This was part of North Somerset Council's ongoing civic pride initiative that has sought to revitalise Weston-super-Mare's public spaces, which had suffered a period of decline. Other public space improvements have been made throughout the town such as improvements to the street scene in Grove Park Village.|$|E
5|$|Back in the present, Chandler apologizes to Monica. Rachel reveals that's not {{the story}} she was {{referring}} to. The flashbacks continue to 1988; Ross and Chandler arrive for dinner {{to find that}} Monica has slimmed down, and Chandler now finds her attractive. Monica tells Rachel {{that she wants to}} humiliate Chandler for calling her fat, so Rachel suggests tricking him into taking off his clothes. Monica tries to seduce Chandler by rubbing various objects, including a knife, against her skin. She drops the knife and severs his toe. He is rushed to hospital to have it reattached but, in the commotion, Monica mixes up the digit with <b>a</b> <b>carrot.</b> In the present, Chandler becomes upset after learning that he had lost his toe because he called Monica fat, and angrily leaves. When Monica comes by his apartment seeking his forgiveness by putting a turkey on her head, he inadvertently tells her he loves {{her for the first time}} in their relationship. A tag scene shows another of Phoebe's past life memories as she serves in a World War I field hospital and again lost an arm.|$|E

25|$|The Third Reich 'n Roll came next, a {{pastiche}} on 1960s {{rock and}} roll with an overarching Nazi theme, represented visually on the album cover, which featured Dick Clark in an SS uniform holding <b>a</b> <b>carrot,</b> {{with a number of}} Hitlers dancing on clouds behind him. On each side of the record was a single composition, approximately 17½ minutes long, using recordings of classic {{rock and roll}} songs that were spliced, overdubbed, and edited with new vocals, instrumentation and tape noises.|$|E
25|$|Nor {{could the}} federal {{government}} take its component states to task. The initial federal budget was quite small, limiting {{the federal government}}'s ability to use its financial largesse as <b>a</b> <b>carrot.</b> It was dependent upon grants from the United Kingdom and from its member states. The provincial budgets of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago were both larger than the federal budget. This led to repeated requests for those states to provide greater financing to the federal government. These requests were not well received, as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago together already contributed 85 {{percent of the federal}} revenue, in roughly equal portions.|$|E
25|$|Unrounded front vowels (or Intermediate or neutral vowels) {{can occur}} {{together}} with either back vowels (e.g. répa carrot, kocsi car) or rounded front vowels (e.g. tető, tündér), but rounded front vowels and back vowels can occur together only in words of foreign origins (e.g. sofőr = chauffeur, French word for driver). The basic {{rule is that}} words including at least one back vowel take back vowel suffixes (e.g. répá|ban in <b>a</b> <b>carrot,</b> kocsi|ban in a car), while words excluding back vowels usually take front vowel suffixes (except for words including only the vowels i or í, {{for which there is}} no general rule, e.g. liszt|et, hid|at).|$|E

In addition, he ordered {{the construction of a new}} city, al-Muwaffaqiyyah, which provided provisions and other services for his men. Throughout the siege he utilized <b>a</b> <b>carrot</b> and stick approach with the rebels; Zanj troops that voluntarily surrendered were granted guarantees of safety and rewards, and were paraded in front of al-Mukhtarah to convince others to join them, while rebel soldiers that were killed in battle were at times decapitated and their heads were displayed in view of the defenders.|$|E
25|$|Plastid {{differentiation}} is not permanent, in fact many interconversions are possible. Chloroplasts may {{be converted}} to chromoplasts, which are pigment-filled plastids responsible for the bright colors seen in flowers and ripe fruit. Starch storing amyloplasts can also {{be converted to}} chromoplasts, {{and it is possible}} for proplastids to develop straight into chromoplasts. Chromoplasts and amyloplasts can also become chloroplasts, like what happens when <b>a</b> <b>carrot</b> or a potato is illuminated. If a plant is injured, or something else causes a plant cell to revert to a meristematic state, chloroplasts and other plastids can turn back into proplastids. Chloroplast, amyloplast, chromoplast, proplast, etc., are not absolute states—intermediate forms are common.|$|E

Upon Vladimir's return, the increasingly jaded Estragon suggests that they hang themselves, but they abandon the idea when the logistics seem ineffective. They then speculate on the potential rewards of continuing to wait for Godot, but can come to no definite conclusions. When Estragon declares his hunger, Vladimir provides <b>a</b> <b>carrot</b> (among a collection of turnips), at which Estragon idly gnaws, loudly reiterating his boredom.|$|E

500|$|Throffer has not, however, been universally adopted; Michael R. Rhodes {{notes that}} there has been some {{controversy}} in the literature on whether to use throffer, citing a number of writers, including Lawrence A. Alexander, David Zimmerman and Daniel Lyons, who do not use the term. Some, including political scientists Deiniol Jones and Andrew Rigby, consider throffer to be synonymous with carrot and stick, an idiom which refers to the way a donkey is offered <b>a</b> <b>carrot</b> to encourage compliance, while noncompliance is punished with a stick. Other writers, while electing to use the word, consider it a poor one. For instance, literary scholar Daniel Shore calls it [...] "a somewhat unfortunate term", while using it in his analysis of John Milton's Paradise Regained.|$|E

[...] For desensitization training, Judge and the rest of Thunder's team would haul him to the football field at a local high school to work with people carrying pom-poms and to run across a marked field.

500|$|Beatles biographer Bill Harry {{wrote that}} Lennon began drawing and writing creatively {{at an early}} age with the {{encouragement}} of his uncle. He collected his stories, poetry, cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the Daily Howl. The drawings were often of crippled people, and the writings satirical, and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay. According to classmate Bill Turner, Lennon created the Daily Howl to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate Pete Shotton, to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it. Turner said that Lennon [...] "had an obsession for Wigan Pier. It kept cropping up", and in Lennon's story <b>A</b> <b>Carrot</b> in a Potato Mine, [...] "the mine {{was at the end of}} Wigan Pier." [...] Turner described how one of Lennon's cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question, [...] "Why?". Above was a flying pancake, and below, [...] "a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog—also wearing glasses".|$|E
