25|$|Although the Vikings {{held the}} wind {{advantage}} {{again during the}} final quarter, the Giants defense managed to shut them down to preserve the victory. The Vikings had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>chance</b> {{to tie the game}} when Carter caught a deep pass from backup quarterback Sean Salisbury and appeared to be {{on his way to a}} sure touchdown, but safety Myron Guyton caught up with him from behind and knocked the ball out of his hands. Jackson recovered it for the Giants on the Vikings 15-yard line to put the game away.|$|E
25|$|Their defense {{subsequently}} {{gave them}} <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>chance</b> {{to take the}} lead when they recovered a fumble from Craig on the 49ers 37-yard line. But penalties stalled the drive and Murray missed a 43-yard field goal attempt. Still, the Lions defense came up with another huge opportunity as defensive back Bobby Watkins intercepted a pass from Montana and returned it 24 yards to the San Francisco 27. This time the Lions offense managed to covert the turnover with a 2-yard touchdown run by Sims, giving them their first lead of the game, 23–17 with 4:44 remaining.|$|E

New Orleans defensive end Vince Buck recovered the ball and returned it 62 yards for a potential touchdown, only to see the play wiped out by an offsides penalty on teammate Robert Massey, who had lined up with his hand over the neutral zone. The penalty not only eliminated the score, but it also gave Chicago a first down, and seven plays later, Butler kicked a 25-yard field goal to put them up 13-3.|$|E

25|$|Buffalo had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>chance</b> to put {{the game}} away when Lou Piccone blocked a Chargers punt that was {{recovered}} by linebacker Ervin Parker on the San Diego 38. But safety Glen Edwards intercepted a pass from Ferguson on the San Diego 9-yard line to keep the Bills from scoring. With 6:17 left in regulation, Buffalo got another chance to get a decisive score when they recovered a fumbled punt return from Mike Fuller. But two plays later, defensive tackle Fred Dean dropped Joe Cribbs for a 1-yard loss on third and 1, and then Nick Mike-Mayer missed a 49-yard field goal attempt, giving the ball back to San Diego with 3:59 left.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} quarter, a fumble lost by Los Angeles running back Eric Dickerson led to Washington kicker Jess Atkinson's 25-yard field goal. The Redskins then {{extended}} their lead, 10–0, driving 60 yards to quarterback Jay Schroeder's 14-yard touchdown to running back Kelvin Bryant. A key {{play on the}} drive was a controversial pass interference penalty against Rams Pro Bowl cornerback LeRoy Irvin, which gave the Redskins 28 yards; 13 from the initial penalty and another 15 against Irvin for arguing with officials about it. LA had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>chance</b> to respond when quarterback Jim Everett completed a 45-yard pass to Kevin House on the Redskins 28, but the drive ended with no points when Dickerson lost another fumble.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} tactical {{decision is}} the choice of shot types. Round shot is the default shot type, with upgrades providing grape shot and chain shot. Each type causes {{a different type of}} damage, and also has different ballistic capabilities. Round shot has the longest range of the three, and greatest speed. Upon impact, it has <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>chance</b> of damaging a ship's hull (potentially sinking the ship), and a smaller chance of destroying cannon, killing crew, or damaging the sails. Chain shot has a shorter range and flies at a slower speed in a high trajectory. Its impact is most likely to cause sail damage to the enemy ship, slowing it down or potentially dismasting it. Chain shot also has a small chance of killing enemy crew. Grape shot is very slow and has a short range, but upon impact it can kill large portions of the enemy crew, weakening the ship and slowing its reloading. Grape shot also has the potential of damaging enemy sails.|$|E

25|$|Philadelphia's offense {{made a major}} {{improvement}} {{in the second half}} (229 yards and 11 first downs), but they would not score until 10:38 remained in the fourth quarter when fullback Anthony Toney capped an 80-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 14-7. Eagles linebacker Seth Joyner then picked off a pass from Everett on the Philadelphia 30-yard line, giving the team <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>chance</b> to drive for the tying score. But they ended up punting {{at the end of an}} ugly series in which Heath Sherman fumbled after an 11-yard run (recovered by receiver Cris Carter), Randall Cunningham fumbled a snap (he recovered it), and then threw two incompletions. Los Angeles subsequently put the game away with a 84-yard, 7-play scoring drive. Everett kept it going on third and 5 with a 15-yard completion to running back Buford McGee, and then Bell took off for a 54-yard burst on the next play, moving the ball to the Eagles 10-yard line. Eventually, he finished the drive with a 7-yard touchdown run, making the final score 21-7.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Baltimore {{defensive}} back Chris McAlister gave the offense <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>chance</b> to score when he intercepted a pass from Stewart {{and returned it}} 18 yards to the Steelers 7-yard line. But on the next play, safety Brent Alexander intercepted Grbac's pass {{in the end zone}} for a touchback. The Steelers took over and drove to the Ravens 9-yard line, but on third down, Stewart was sacked for an 8-yard loss by Larry Webster and Brown's ensuing field goal attempt was wide left. Following another three and out for Baltimore, receiver Troy Edwards returned their punt 27-yards to the Ravens 43-yard line, setting up Zereoue's second touchdown run. Then linebacker Jason Gildon recovered a fumble from Terry Allen on Baltimore's next drive and the Steelers capitalized with a 46-yard field goal from Brown, increasing their lead to 20–0 with 4:23 left in the half. After going all this time without a single first down, Baltimore finally managed to respond on their next drive. Tight end Shannon Sharpe caught four passes for 48 yards on an 11-play, 57-yard drive. Matt Stover capped it off with a 26-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 20–3 at halftime.|$|E
25|$|In 1393 the Bulgarian tsar Ivan Shishman {{had lost}} Nicopolis— his {{temporary}} capital— to the Ottomans, while his brother, Ivan Stratsimir, still held Vidin {{but had been}} reduced to an Ottoman vassal. In the eyes of the Bulgarian boyars, despots and other independent Balkan rulers, the crusade was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>chance</b> to reverse the course of the Ottoman conquest and free the Balkans from Islamic rule. In addition, the frontline between Islam and Christianity had been moving slowly towards the Kingdom of Hungary. The Kingdom of Hungary was now the frontier between the two religions in Eastern Europe, and the Hungarians were in danger of being attacked themselves. The Republic of Venice feared that an Ottoman control of the Balkan peninsula, which included Venetian territories like parts of Morea and Dalmatia, would reduce their influence over the Adriatic Sea, Ionian Sea and Aegean Sea. The Republic of Genoa, on the other hand, feared that if the Ottomans were to gain control over River Danube and the Turkish Straits, they would eventually obtain a monopoly over the trade routes between Europe and the Black Sea, where the Genoese had many important colonies like Caffa, Sinop and Amasra. The Genoese also owned the citadel of Galata, located at the north of the Golden Horn in Constantinople, to which Bayezid had laid siege in 1395.|$|E

Earnhardt was quick to forgive him for the last-lap accident: [...] "He didn't wreck anyone on purpose. He was trying to push the 48. I don't think he thought, 'Oh, here's my chance to knock them both out.' He just got excited trying to push the 48." [...] Johnson was less sanguine: [...] "We had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>chance</b> to make up some points and got crashed by a teammate... I was real patient until the white flag was up.

Only a 35-yard Gerrard smasher was going to change that. The players have been magnificent – we are proud of the way we played." [...] Captain Nigel Reo-Coker found defeat hard to take as he felt they had done enough to win the final: [...] "I can't describe it how I feel at the moment – gutted because I think we deserved to win this game. The players put in a fantastic effort, but it just wasn't to be for us. It was a marvellous FA Cup final and we gave all we could. I hope everyone was proud – it just wasn't our day." ...|$|E

Francesco Moser, who won in 1984 and {{finished in the top}} three in 1985 and 1986, did not participate because of a head trauma and bruises sustained in a crash in the weeks prior to the race. Spanish sports newspaper El Mundo Deportivo and Gian Paolo Ormezzano from Italy's La Stampa named several other riders as contenders for the overall classification, such as Giuseppe Saronni, then-world champion Moreno Argentin, Stephen Roche, and Robert Millar. Since [...] team leader Greg LeMond did not participate in the race due to injuries sustained in a , El Mundo Deportivo believed Jean-François Bernard to be a dark horse.

[...] Ology's Josh Harrison similarly praised [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] for having [...] "some wonderful Krusty the Klown moments and some clutch guest star appearances". He also cited the visual gags in the episode as [...] "clever".

50|$|The 2005 RL {{was also}} the first Honda vehicle to use the Advanced Compatibility Engineering (ACE) body structure, which has since proliferated {{throughout}} every newly introduced Honda and Acura vehicle design.

In practical terms, this means in an SUV versus ACE structure car collision, there is <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>chance</b> that the ACE body structure will engage with the SUV's frame and dissipate collision forces around the passenger compartment.
