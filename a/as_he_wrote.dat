5|$|Balzac {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the novel during a trip to Brittany arranged by a family friend in 1828. Intrigued by the people and atmosphere of the region, he began collecting notes and descriptions for later use. After publishing an Avertissement for the novel, he released three editions – each of them revised significantly. The first novel Balzac published without a pseudonym, he used many titles <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> and published, including Le Gars, Les Chouans ou la Bretagne il y a trente ans, and Le Dernier Chouan ou la Bretagne en 1800.|$|E
5|$|Carl Eytel (September 12, 1862 – September 17, 1925) was a German American {{artist who}} built his {{reputation}} for paintings and drawings of desert subjects in the American Southwest. Immigrating to the United States in 1885, he settled in Palm Springs, California in 1903. With an extensive knowledge of the Sonoran Desert, Eytel traveled with author George Wharton James <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> the successful Wonders of the Colorado Desert, and contributed over 300 drawings to the 1908 work. While he enjoyed success as an artist, he lived as an ascetic and would die in poverty. Eytel's most important work, Desert Near Palm Springs, hangs in the History Room of the California State Library.|$|E
5|$|However, in Berlin Meyerbeer faced many problems, {{including}} the enmity of the jealous Gaspare Spontini, who since 1820 had been Court Kapellmeister {{and director of}} the Berlin Hofoper. Complaints were made in the Berlin press about the delay of the Berlin premiere of Robert le diable (which finally took place in June 1832), and Meyerbeer's music was decried by the critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab. There was no sign of the German opera expected from Meyerbeer. Moreover, reactionary censorship laws prevented production of Les Huguenots in Berlin, (and indeed in many other cities of Germany). Nevertheless, Meyerbeer, who (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> to a friend) 'years ago...swore to myself never to respond personally to attacks on my work, and never under any circumstances to cause or respond to personal polemics', refused to be drawn on any of these matters.|$|E

5|$|Minority Report also {{continues}} Spielberg's {{tradition of}} depicting broken families.*Vest. pg. 136 In Dick's short story, Anderton is a childless, married man whose main motives are self-preservation and preventing the disassembly of the PreCrime division. While {{he is also}} trying to save himself in the movie, his greater concern is uncovering the story behind his son's disappearance. Spielberg would later transform his next science fiction film, War of the Worlds, from a story about a single man to one about a divorced father concerned with protecting his children. Buckland notes that the two tragic parent-child relationships in the picture (Agatha and Ann Lively, John and Sean Anderton) have a common element. The movie has four shots of them submerged in water. Agatha's face is shown in a close up shot, taken from directly above her, when she is submerged in her photon milk, nutrient bath. When photos of her mother's submerged corpse are shown to her, the emphasized photograph is a similar image of her face taken from directly above. Anderton and his son are shown together in a pool flashback scene in which they have a contest to see who can hold their breath longest. John is underwater when his son is taken, and later in the apartment he is shown lying motionless, immersed in a filled bathtub, in a manner Buckland finds similar to the shots of Agatha and Ann. Buckland notes that co-screenwriter Frank introduced the water theme, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> Agatha and her mother's back stories while adding the bathtub scene.|$|E

25|$|As 1923 {{turned into}} 1924, Sibelius was distracted {{from his work}} on the symphony by a number of outside events: the award of a large cash prize from a Helsinki foundation, family birthdays and the {{composition}} of a number of brief piano works.

25|$|Swedenborg {{proposed}} many scientific ideas {{during his}} lifetime. In his youth, {{he wanted to}} present a new idea every day, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> to his brother-in-law Erik Benzelius in 1718. Around 1730, he had changed his mind, and instead believed that higher knowledge {{is not something that}} can be acquired, but that it is based on intuition. After 1745, he instead considered himself receiving scientific knowledge in a spontaneous manner from angels.|$|E
25|$|Later Greek historians {{consider}} Democritus to {{have established}} aesthetics {{as a subject}} of investigation and study, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> theoretically on poetry and fine art long before authors such as Aristotle. Specifically, Thrasyllus identified six works in the philosopher's oeuvre which had belonged to aesthetics as a discipline, but only fragments of the relevant works are extant; hence of all Democritus's writings on these matters, {{only a small percentage}} of his thoughts and ideas can be known.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{original}} outline, Adams {{was said to}} make up the stories <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote.</b> He turned to John Lloyd for help with the final two episodes of the first series. Lloyd contributed bits from an unpublished science fiction book of his own, called GiGax. Very little of Lloyd's material survived in later adaptations of Hitchhiker's, such as the novels and the TV series. The TV series was based on the first six radio episodes, and sections contributed by Lloyd were largely re-written.|$|E

25|$|With these plays, Wilde came to {{dominate}} late-Victorian era British theatre. His plays are noted for the lightness of their wit, {{but he also}} contrived to address some serious issues around sexual and class roles and identity, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> himself 'treating the serious things lightly and the light things seriously'. Events in Wilde's personal life were to overtake his literary success and he died in Paris in 1900. He {{remains one of the}} great figures in the history of Irish theatre and his plays are frequently performed all over the English-speaking world.|$|E

25|$|On May 16, 1883, Sir Laurence Oliphant {{wrote in}} the New York Sun that he had met with Mr. Sursock {{regarding}} {{the construction of a}} railway in the Jezreel Valley, and claimed that he could see surveying work <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote,</b> from his home in Daliyat al-Karmel. Oliphant founded a company along with Gottlieb Schumacher, {{one of the founders of}} the German Colony of Haifa, and Georg Agger of Jaffa, which would find investors for attaining a construction permit from the Sursock family, and the construction itself.|$|E
25|$|After {{attending}} {{primary school}} in Bucharest, Grigore {{was sent to}} Lycée Louis-le-Grand. In 1902, he enrolled in the Zürich Polytechnic, graduating in 1907. After becoming an engineer, he studied at the law faculty of the University of Paris, earning a qualification as a lawyer. During that interval, he had left-wing sympathies, attending events organized by Barbu Lăzăreanu and Christian Rakovsky. He witnessed Rakovsky's disputes with Romanian nationalists, which, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> in 1912, gave him the certainty that socialism would eventually win. In 1909, Filipescu married Ioana (born 1890), daughter of Matei B. Cantacuzino and {{a representative of the}} Cantacuzene aristocrats. The couple had no children.|$|E
25|$|Galen {{saw himself}} as both a {{physician}} and a philosopher, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> in his treatise entitled That the Best Physician Is Also a Philosopher. Galen {{was very interested in}} the debate between the rationalist and empiricist medical sects, and his use of direct observation, dissection and vivisection represents a complex middle ground between the extremes of those two viewpoints. Many of his works have been preserved and/or translated from the original Greek, although many were destroyed and some credited to him are believed to be spurious. Although there is some debate over the date of his death, he was no younger than seventy when he died.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of complements {{depends on the}} pattern followed by the verb (for example, {{whether it is a}} transitive verb, i.e. one taking a direct object).

25|$|Lewis {{suggested}} {{that he did not}} directly intend to write his Narnia stories as Christian tales, but that these aspects appeared subconsciously <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote,</b> although the books did become Christian as they progressed. He thought that the tales were not direct representations or allegory, but that they might evoke or remind readers of Biblical stories. In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Aslan is a Christ-like figure who suffers a death of atonement and returns to life in a similar way to Christ's crucifixion and resurrection. The Magician's Nephew has similar biblical allusions, reflecting aspects of The Book of Genesis such as the creation, original sin and temptation.|$|E
25|$|By 1460, the {{nautical}} charts would {{refer to}} this island as Ilha de São Luis. It was at about this time that Valentim Fernandes da Morávia, a German intellectual and translator residing in Lisbon, recounted the first story related to the settlement of the island. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote,</b> Frair Pedro, the queen's confessor, traveled with the Infanta D. Isabella of Portugal, Duchess of Burgundy, to Flanders, where he met and developed a friendship with the nobleman Josse van Huerter. During their conversations D. Pedro talked to van Huerter of the islands and that there existed deposits of silver and tin (which he assumed were the Ilhas Cassitérides, or in English, the Islands of Tin). Van Huerter convinced 15 other men of the profitability of a venture in the archipelago.|$|E

At 15 he became a novice monk with the Roman Catholic Brothers of Ploermel in Jersey and later in Shropshire, but left the monastery six years later after losing his faith. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> in his autobiography he realised he wanted to break each of the Ten Commandments in order and thought he should get out before he did something serious. He did his national service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving from 1955 until 1957.
