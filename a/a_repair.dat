5|$|Bonhoeffer et al. {{suggested}} that template switching by the reverse transcriptase acts as <b>a</b> <b>repair</b> process {{to deal with}} breaks in the ssRNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin {{suggested that}} recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged ssRNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is <b>a</b> <b>repair</b> process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized {{whether or not the}} two genomes differ genetically. On the view that that recombination in HIV is <b>a</b> <b>repair</b> process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.|$|E

5|$|Reclassified as <b>a</b> <b>repair</b> ship on 16 August 1937, Asahi {{was taken}} out of reserve in November, after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident that started the Second Sino-Japanese War, and was used as a {{transport}} to land troops in an amphibious landing at Hangzhou Bay. Afterwards she began conversion at Kure, Japan, into <b>a</b> <b>repair</b> ship; this was completed on 18 December 1938. Asahi was fitted with a dummy wooden main battery fore and aft to resemble an old battleship after her arrival in Shanghai on 29 December. In May 1939 she was modified to act as a torpedo depot ship and carried out patrols between 29 May and 7 November 1940. She was transferred to Camranh Bay, French Indochina, on 15 November 1940 and later transported the 11th Base Unit from Kure to Camranh Bay 19 November – 7 December 1941.|$|E

5|$|In {{its first}} {{operating}} year, a stable {{was built for}} the lodge, at the lodge's south driveway about 100 yards from Scarborough Road. In 1909 an addition was built (of 62 by 126 feet) and the entire structure became used for an automobile garage. The interior of the old stable was replaced. The east end held a commercial kitchen, dining room, and a billiard and smoking room. The west end held <b>a</b> <b>repair</b> shop. The {{front of the building}} held supply rooms, closets, and an office. The upstairs held bedrooms and bathrooms for the chauffeurs.|$|E
5|$|The variable-quality cement {{which had}} been used in the {{construction}} of the Causeway bridges meant that by the early 2000s, they had suffered significant damage, leading to <b>a</b> <b>repair</b> contract being awarded to Kulin Group in 2004. Localised patching of cracks in the piers was undertaken. At the ends of the piers, the cracking was more substantial and had to be tied back with carbon fibre reinforcement. Repairs were then coated with moisture-resistant coating, and were expected to lengthen the life of the bridges by decades.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to the United Kingdom in 1904, Victorious served as the second flagship of the Channel Fleet. She remained in active service with the fleet in various units until 1908, when she was modernized and then placed in reserve. At {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in August 1914 she was mobilized with three of her sister ships into the 9th Battle Squadron, though by January 1915 she was again withdrawn from front-line service. In September her main guns were removed to arm a pair of monitors. Victorious was subsequently used as <b>a</b> <b>repair</b> ship. After {{the end of the war}} she was renamed Indus II; plans to use her as a harbor ship were cancelled and, in April 1923, she was sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|At the FBI Academy, Dana Scully reads Mulder's initial report. The only {{connection}} between the murders that he can see is that the suspects all destroyed an electronic device during the killings. Meanwhile, Bonnie McRoberts, another Franklin resident, drops by <b>a</b> <b>repair</b> shop {{to pick up her}} car, where a message on an engine diagnostic display warns her that the mechanic is going to rape her. She impulsively kills him with an oil can spout. When Mulder and Spencer question her the next morning, her kitchen microwave instructs her to kill them. When she grabs a knife and attacks Mulder, she is shot and killed by Spencer.|$|E
5|$|Bombs often {{landed on}} the estate during the blitz of Bristol. In September 1940, during a raid on the Bristol Aeroplane Company factory at Filton, bombs cut off the estate's water supply, and during a later raid, one bomb badly damaged the lantern roof light over the hallway. In 1946, {{after the end of}} the war, Lady Wraxall applied to the Ministry of Defence for <b>a</b> <b>repair</b> grant, but was turned down. As a result damp, and latterly birds, entered the house through the roof light, until the house came into the {{ownership}} of the National Trust and was repaired.|$|E

5|$|HMS Romney {{returned}} to Britain in November that year, {{at which point}} Captain Robert McDougall took command. By March 1783 she was sailing in the Western Approaches under Captain John Wickey and flying the broad pendant of Captain John Elliot. Wickey was replaced by Captain Thomas Lewes in July 1782, {{who went on to}} capture the 12-gun privateer Comte de Bois-Goslin off Ushant on 17 October 1782. Romneys next commander was Captain Samuel Osborn, from January to April 1783, after which she was paid off. After a period spent in ordinary, she underwent <b>a</b> <b>repair</b> and refit at Woolwich, eventually recommissioning in March 1792 under Captain William Domett, as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Samuel Goodall. She served in the Mediterranean until the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, recommissioning under Captain William Paget in March 1793, and returning to the Mediterranean {{to take part in the}} British occupation of Toulon.|$|E
5|$|Interned at New Orleans, Louisiana at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Breslau was seized in 1917 by the United States after her entry into the war and commissioned into the Navy as USS Bridgeport. Originally slated to be <b>a</b> <b>repair</b> ship, she was reclassified as a destroyer tender the following year. Bridgeport completed several transatlantic convoy crossings before she was stationed at Brest, France, where she remained in a support role {{after the end of}} World War I. After returning to the United States in November 1919, she spent the next five years along the East Coast and in the Caribbean tending destroyers and conducting training missions. She was decommissioned in November 1924 and placed in reserve at the Boston Navy Yard.|$|E
5|$|M-86 {{currently}} uses two bridges {{eligible for}} listing on the NRHP. The span over the St. Joseph River in Three Rivers {{was built in}} 1903. It is a five-span concrete arch bridge constructed to look as though created from stacked masonry blocks. The current railings were added in 1952 by the MSHD during <b>a</b> <b>repair</b> project. The second historic structure is the bridge over the Prairie River in Centreville. This camelback pony truss span was moved to its current location in 1938–39, although it was originally built on an unknown location in 1923. In the move, two sidewalks, one {{on either side of}} the trusses, were eliminated from the structure. This project was part of Public Works Administration relief work in the area.|$|E

Upon leaving, the agents find their car going out of control on its own, leading it to crash into another car. At <b>a</b> <b>repair</b> shop, the car is found to have no evidence of tampering, but an electrical charge is detected within it.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March, Scharnhorst, Tirpitz, and Lützow steamed to Altafjord {{for repairs}} to damage {{incurred}} in heavy storms. In early April, Scharnhorst, Tirpitz, and nine destroyers conducted a training mission to Bear Island in the Arctic Ocean. On the 8th, a serious internal explosion {{occurred in the}} aft auxiliary machinery space above the armor deck. The explosion killed or injured 34 men and prompted the crew to flood the magazines for turret Caesar as a precaution against a magazine explosion. <b>A</b> <b>repair</b> ship completed work on the vessel in two weeks. Fuel shortages prevented major operations {{for the next six}} months, during which Scharnhorst was able to conduct only short training maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|On 24 February 1990, tugboats moved Texas from {{dry dock}} to <b>a</b> <b>repair</b> {{facility}} on Green's Bayou for further repairs. It {{was here that}} the wood deck was installed and four of the ten mounts of quad 40mm guns were installed. On 26 July, the ship was returned to her berth at San Jacinto where the final six mounts of 40mm guns were installed. Repairs complete, the ship officially reopened to the public on 8 September 1990. Since returning to her slip at San Jacinto, members of the ship's staff and volunteers have worked to restore the interior spaces.|$|E
