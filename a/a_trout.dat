5|$|The {{site was}} closed in 1978 and leased {{to a private}} company; however, the venture failed, and it closed to bathers in 1984. It was {{for a short time}} used as <b>a</b> <b>trout</b> farm, but was {{threatened}} with demolition, as an alternative to repair. In 2003 Bath and North East Somerset council put the site up for sale or long lease, and it was added to the English Heritage Buildings at Risk Register. A trust was formed in 2005 to rescue the pool from dilapidation. In 2006 its listed building status was raised from II to II* as it is considered particularly important buildings of more than special interest.|$|E

50|$|The first streams were {{designated}} as Class <b>A</b> Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters in 1983. At that time, 138 stream sections, totaling nearly 400 mi of streams, {{were found to}} meet the criteria. As more streams were assessed, the number of Class <b>A</b> Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters grew rapidly. By 2005, there were 436 Class <b>A</b> Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters, totaling 2036 km. By the end of 2008, there were 487 such stream sections, which together included 1436 mi of streams.

5000|$|Class <b>A</b> Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters are the [...] "best of the best" [...] streams {{for trout}} fishing in Pennsylvania. They are {{distributed}} widely across the state. However, most {{are found in}} north-central and northeastern Pennsylvania, while very few are in the western third of the state. Some Class <b>A</b> Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters are located in The Poconos or the Lehigh Valley. As of 2009, 49 of the state's 67 counties contain at least one Class <b>A</b> Wild <b>Trout</b> stream. However, in that year, only nine counties contained at least 30 mi of Class <b>A</b> Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters.|$|R
5|$|Historically, the Lenni Lenape people {{inhabited}} {{the area in}} the vicinity of Darby Creek. By the 17th century, the Dutch and Swedish had arrived in the area, followed some years later by the English. Numerous mills of various types were eventually build along the creek and several railroads traversed the watershed. In modern times, grants by various organizations have been awarded to improve the creek and its watershed. The Darby Creek Valley Association operates within the watershed. Part of the creek's length is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery, part is <b>a</b> <b>Trout</b> Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Various species of fish, including redbreast sunfish, eels, and trout, inhabit it. Several areas {{in the vicinity of the}} creek are listed on the Delaware County Natural Areas Inventory. These include the Darby Creek Mouth Mudflat, the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge, and the Ithan-Darby Creek Wetlands. A reach of the creek is navigable by canoe.|$|E
5|$|In the Georgian period Bath {{had grown}} in {{popularity}} as a spa town. The opening of Pulteney Bridge enabled {{the development of}} Bathwick and land {{to the east of}} the River Avon. The pools were built next to the river on the site of old marl pits. The developers went bankrupt ten years after opening the pools but they were sold had operated privately until they were taken over by the local corporation in the 1890s. They then operated as a public swimming baths until the 1970s. The pool closed in 1984 and was used for a short time as <b>a</b> <b>trout</b> farm before closure and falling into disrepair. In 2005 a trust was formed to raise funds for renovation and reopening of the pools. Public support and grants from bodies such as the Heritage Lottery Fund have aided regeneration of the site, which is expected to reopen in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{watershed}} of Roaring Creek is in Columbia County, but small areas are in Montour County, Northumberland County, and Schuylkill County. More than 40 percent of {{the watershed}} is forested and nearly 40 percent is agricultural land. State game lands and state forests {{are also in the}} watershed. A total of approximately 3,500 people inhabit the watershed, as of 2000. The creek's drainage basin is a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery upstream of Lick Run. Downstream of Lick Run, the main stem is <b>a</b> <b>Trout</b> Stocked Fishery and Migratory Fishery. A reach of the creek above Lick Run is designated as Class A Wild Trout Waters. 31 species of fish were observed at 20 sites in the watershed in 2003 and 2004.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, {{there were}} 274 Class <b>A</b> Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters for brook trout, {{comprising}} 743.6 mi of streams.

50|$|Class <b>A</b> Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters are {{the highest}} biomass class given to streams in Pennsylvania by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. They are {{considered}} to contain the highest-quality naturally reproducing trout populations in Pennsylvania. The first streams received their Class <b>A</b> Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters designations in 1983. There are now hundreds of such waters, comprising nearly 1500 mi of streams. Class <b>A</b> Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters receive certain legal protections. For instance, they are typically classified by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection as High-Quality Coldwater Fisheries. Most Class <b>A</b> Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters are subject to standard statewide angling regulations by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission.|$|R
50|$|The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection designates Class <b>A</b> Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters as High-Quality Coldwater Fisheries, {{provided}} {{that there has}} been an adequate period of public comment and participation. This provides such streams with extra legal protections under the federal Clean Water Act. Thus, any activity involving discharges into a Class <b>A</b> Wild <b>Trout</b> Stream is required to comply with more restrictive standards than for other streams. Some streams receive Exceptional Value status due to their classification as Class <b>A</b> Wild <b>Trout</b> Waters.|$|R
5|$|US131 and its {{predecessors}} bears several memorial designations {{in addition to}} the Sidney Ouwinga Memorial Bypass near Cadillac. One of the oldest is the Mackinaw Trail, named after a former Indian trail that ran from Saginaw to Mackinaw City and Sault Ste. Marie. By 1915, the name was transferred to the roadway that was later numbered US131. The Mackinaw Trail Association was formed that year to promote an all-weather highway between Grand Rapids and Mackinaw City, using a logo incorporating <b>a</b> <b>trout</b> for the road. The name was to be officially applied to the highway in 1929, but the State Senate did not agree to the proposal. The official endorsement of the name came in 1959, after the opening of the Mackinac Bridge revitalized the idea.|$|E
5|$|The main stem of Darby Creek is {{designed}} as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its source to the Pennsylvania Route 3 bridge. From that point downstream to its mouth, the non-tidal portions of the creek's main stem are <b>a</b> <b>Trout</b> Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Numerous fish species were observed in the creek during a 2009 electrofishing survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for smallmouth bass was slightly over 10 and the rate for rock bass was under 10. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for redbreast sunfish was 123, the highest of several warmwater streams tested during the survey. Some stocked rainbow trout and brown trout were also captured in the creek. High numbers of American eels were observed in the creek was well. Fish species such as mummichogs, silvery minnows, striped bass, and white perch were found at the head-of-tide of the creek. Brown trout naturally reproduce in the creek's headwaters.|$|E

25|$|Releasing wild trout helps {{preserve}} {{the quality of}} a fishery. Trout are more delicate than most fish and require careful handling. When <b>a</b> <b>trout</b> has been caught but the hook is still embedded, wet your hands before handling the fish. Dry hands stick to the adhesive slime coating the fish and can pull off its scales. It is preferred for the fish to remain in the water when removing the hook, but holding the trout out of the water will not be lethal, provided the hook is removed quickly and the trout is returned immediately.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the hook}} has been removed, return the trout into the water. Support the trout until it stabilizes. This {{includes}} holding {{the fish in}} water deep enough to submerge its gills. After long fights, {{it may be necessary}} to manually move water past its gills. This can be done either by holding the trout in moving water with its head facing upstream, or, in calm water, moving the trout backwards and forwards repeatedly. Once stabilized, the trout will swim off on its own. If released prematurely, the trout, not having enough energy to move, will sink to the bottom of the river and suffocate. Take however long is necessary to revive <b>a</b> <b>trout.</b>|$|E
