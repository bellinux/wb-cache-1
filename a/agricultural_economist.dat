40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{in the past that}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>economists</b> have had a limited input to the agricultural policy making process because of their preoccupation with issues of economic efficiency. The contrary hypothesis that the contribution of <b>agricultural</b> <b>economists</b> to the policy debate is hampered as much by our limited understanding of human behaviour and the lack of relevant data as it is by any preoccupation with efficiency is advanced in this paper. This notion is illustrated with reference to commodity stabilisation policy, the role of expectations in economic models, the economics of regulation and issues associated with the competitiveness of the rural sector. In discussing these issues, an attempt is made to outline areas where research is needed in order that <b>agricultural</b> <b>economists</b> can further the policy debate.

40|$|ArticleThe main {{argument}} {{in this article}} is that <b>agricultural</b> <b>economists</b> in South Africa must address at least two fundamental questions, namely: (1) "What is the influence of public policy on the structure of agriculture?" and (2) "What is the influence of the governance of farm businesses on their success from a financial, economic, social and environmental point of view?" These questions have been {{at the core of the}} profession of agricultural economics since its beginning, but if <b>agricultural</b> <b>economists</b> want to provide useful answers they will need to revisit the currently dominant paradigm of applied microeconomics.
