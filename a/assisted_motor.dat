40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method of enhancing computer <b>assisted</b> <b>motor</b> rehabilitation for brain injury patients by detailing {{a method of}} overcoming a significant technical constraint. The focus of our system is three dimen- sional(3 D) tracking of upper limb movements on a horizontal tabletop system. We describe a new horizontal table- top system that utilises real-time stereo vision for 3 D tracking of user interaction in the workspace. An overview of existing background removal techniques is presented, and their strengths and weaknesses discussed. We then present a novel approach that utilises polarisation of light for background removal. The system uses an LCD panel for the display device, which achieves a more portable system, and also allows for total removal of screen interference by utilising the polarising nature of LCD technology. Initial testing of this approach has proved highly successful. Key benefits are outlined...|$|E
40|$|Motion capture {{coupled with}} on-body sensing and {{biofeedback}} are key enabling technologies for <b>assisted</b> <b>motor</b> rehabilitation. However, wearability, power efficiency and measurement repeatability remain the principle challenges {{that need to}} be addressed before widespread adoption of such systems becomes possible. The weight and the size of the on-body sensing system needs to be kept small, and the system should not interfere with the user's movements or actions, but in general they are bulky due to their power consumption requirements. Furthermore, on-body sensors are very sensitive to positioning, which causes increased variability in the motion data. Isolating the characteristic patterns that represent the most important motion data affected by random positioning errors, while also reducing the power consumption, is the authors' main concern. An automated computational approach is considered to address the two problems. The use of functional principal component analysis is investigated for signal separation, whilst accounting for variability in the sensor position. To generate motion data, movements of human subjects and a robot arm are captured. As joint angles are considered in the analysis, the results are independent from the technology used to measure motion. The proposed post-processing technique can compensate for uncertainties due to sensor positional changes, whilst allowing greater energy efficiency of the sensors, thus enabling improved flexibility and usability of on-body sensing...|$|E

40|$|Longitudinal {{changes in}} {{cortical}} function {{are known to}} accompany motor skills learning, and can be detected as an evolution in the activation map. These changes include attenuation in activation in the prefrontal cortex and increased activation in primary and secondary motor regions, the cerebellum and posterior parietal cortex. Despite this, comparatively little is known regarding {{the impact of the}} mode or type of training on the speed of activation map plasticity and on longitudinal variation in network architectures. To address this, we randomised twenty-one subjects to learn a complex motor tracking task delivered across six practice sessions in either "free-hand" or "gaze-contingent motor control" mode, during which frontoparietal cortical function was evaluated using functional near infrared spectroscopy. Results demonstrate that upon practice termination, gaze-assisted learners had achieved superior technical performance compared to free-hand learners. Furthermore, evolution in frontoparietal activation foci indicative of expertise was achieved at an earlier stage in practice amongst gaze-assisted learners. Both groups exhibited economical small world topology; however, networks in learners randomised to gaze-assistance were less costly and showed higher values of local efficiency suggesting improved frontoparietal communication in this group. We conclude that the benefits of gaze-assisted motor learning are evidenced by improved technical accuracy, more rapid task internalisation and greater neuronal efficiency. This form of <b>assisted</b> <b>motor</b> learning may have occupational relevance for high precision control such as in surgery or following re-learning as part of stroke rehabilitation. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
