5|$|Chorale preludes were {{composed}} later by Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg and Johann Gottfried Müthel. Max Reger composed <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> as No. 21 of his 52 Chorale Preludes, Op. 67 in 1902. Preludes were also written by Sigfrid Karg-Elert (Op. 87, No. 2), Reinhard Schwarz-Schilling (1927), Karl Höller (Op. 22, 1936), Joseph Ahrens (1942) and Max Drischner (1945).|$|E
5|$|The {{first day}} at Gettysburg, more {{significant}} than simply <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to the bloody second and third days, ranks as the 23rd biggest battle of the war by number of troops engaged. About one quarter of Meade's army (22,000 men) and one third of Lee's army (27,000) were engaged.|$|E

5|$|Following the Battle of France, the Luftwaffe {{started its}} attacks on Channel convoys as <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to the Battle of Britain. The primary task of JG 51 {{during this time}} was to provide fighter escort to these bomber missions. The {{commander}} of JG 51, Oberst Theo Osterkamp established a policy of unrestricted combat air patrol (freie Jagd) of fighter Staffeln providing loose protection rather than close escort to the bombers, actively seeking out Royal Air Force fighters. On 7 July 1940 Oesau claimed one Spitfire.|$|E
5|$|In June 1940, the Wehrmacht had conquered most of Western Europe and Scandinavia. At that time, {{the only}} major power {{standing}} in the way of a German-dominated Europe was the British Empire and the Commonwealth. After having several peace offers rejected by the British, Adolf Hitler ordered the Luftwaffe to destroy the RAF in order to gain air superiority or air supremacy as <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to launching Operation Sea Lion, an amphibious assault by the Wehrmacht (German armed forces) onto the British mainland.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, high scores in cricket matches were {{becoming}} more common as pitches improved, and in the summer of 1880, Roe gave <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to his record breaking of the following year when he hit 223 in a one-day match against his former school. In competitive, albeit second-class, county cricket, his scores remained significantly lower. Nor did he impress in the trial matches at Cambridge in his second year, resulting in him not appearing for the university that season.|$|E

50|$|Between 1708 and 1714, while Johann Sebastian Bach was court organist at the ducal {{court in}} Weimar, he {{compiled}} chorale preludes for the liturgical year in his Orgelbüchlein and included it as a catechism hymn, BWV 638. Georg Friedrich Kauffmann published <b>a</b> Chorale <b>Prelude</b> in Leipzig in 1733. Johann Ludwig Krebs also wrote <b>a</b> Chorale <b>Prelude.</b> Max Reger composed <b>a</b> chorale <b>prelude</b> as No. 10 of his 52 Chorale Preludes, Op. 67 in 1902, another in 1914 in his Op. 135a.|$|R

5|$|Males {{make two}} calls that are {{directed}} at females, sometimes as <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to mating. One is {{a sequence of}} short squeaks; the other {{is made up of}} consecutive ah notes with 0.1 second between each note. These calls can be brief or last up to several minutes. Nestlings make a noisy grating begging call when seeking or expecting food. An adult female may also make the call while incubating the eggs. Immature birds also make a grating call not associated with begging that parents ignore.|$|E
5|$|On the February 16, 2007 {{episode of}} SmackDown! Moore {{suddenly}} switched brands, appearing in an in-ring brawl with other SmackDown! cruiserweights, which was <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to a Cruiserweight Open at No Way Out. Moore was {{eliminated from the}} Cruiserweight Open by the defending WWE Cruiserweight Champion Gregory Helms. Moore then {{established himself as a}} fan favorite by teaming with Scotty 2 Hotty and Jimmy Wang Yang to defeat Helms, Chavo Guerrero, and Daivari in a six-man tag team match.|$|E
5|$|The American {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington were opposed to a wet season Hmong offensive, supporting instead a holding action {{on the edge of}} the Plain of Jars as <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to a possible cease-fire. Washington also insisted that U.S. airpower be used to interdict PAVN supply lines, not as close air support for ground operations. Vang Pao took up the offensive anyway, but his forces could only occupy half of the Plain before his offensive sputtered out at the end of July.|$|E

5|$|The book {{is divided}} into 27 chapters, with <b>a</b> <b>prelude,</b> coda, {{bibliography}} and index. Each chapter deals with a new topic, such as the potential fates of plastics, petroleum infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and artworks.

There is no unifying narrative, cohesive single-chapter overview, or thesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{dictator}} of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, {{took advantage}} of the Uruguayan situation during late 1864 to establish his nation as a regional power. On 11 November of that year, he ordered a Brazilian civilian steamship seized, triggering the Paraguayan War. Then in December, the Paraguayan army invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (currently the state of Mato Grosso do Sul). Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory as <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to an attack upon the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E
5|$|Turkey {{used its}} F-16s {{extensively}} in its conflict with separatist Kurds in Kurdish parts of Turkey and Iraq. Turkey launched its first cross-border raid on 16 December 2007, <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to the 2008 Turkish incursion into northern Iraq, involving 50 fighters before Operation Sun. This {{was the first}} time Turkey had mounted a night-bombing operation on a massive scale, and also the largest operation conducted by Turkish Air Force.|$|E

5|$|With 1,300 deputies {{still in}} Cripple Creek, Sheriff Bowers {{was unable to}} control the army he had created. On June 5, the deputies moved into Altman, perhaps as <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to {{storming}} Bull Hill. The deputies cut the telegraph and telephone wires leading out of town, and imprisoned a number of reporters. Concerned that the paramilitary force might get out of hand, Waite again dispatched the state militia, this time {{under the command of}} General E.J. Brooks.|$|E
5|$|American {{shipwreck}} hunter David Mearns {{first learned}} of the battle in 1996, and began to study it as <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to {{a search for the}} ships in 2001. Mearns, with the aid of other researchers, focused on primary sources (rediscovering several archive files and diaries in the process), and {{came to the conclusion that}} the German accounts were true, and that the ship would be found at the northern position. After attracting the interest of the RAN, Mearns entered into a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search, a not-for-profit company set up to administer and help fund an expedition to locate Sydney and Kormoran. State and Federal government grants totalling just under A$5 million, coupled with private and corporate donations, were used to fund a 45-day search from the end of February to early April 2008.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to his planned {{campaign}} in Greece, Philip went on {{campaign in}} the winter of 339 BC, against the Scythians living south of the Danube, near the river's mouth (in Dobruja). He defeated them in battle, taking many captive, and built a statue of Heracles to commemorate his victory. He then marched through the territory of the Triballi in a demonstration of force, which probably lay upstream along the course of the Danube. During a skirmish, he was severely wounded in the leg when a spear passed through it and killed the horse he was riding. Recovering from this wound may have delayed Philip's campaign in Greece, since he did not set off until the autumn of 339 BC.|$|E

5|$|Douglas-Home {{accepted}} the foreign affairs portfolio in Heath's shadow cabinet. Many expected {{this to be}} a short-lived appointment, <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to Douglas-Home's retirement from politics. It came at a difficult time in British foreign relations: events in the self-governing colony of Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia), which had been drifting towards crisis for some years, finally erupted into open rebellion against British sovereignty. The predominantly white minority government there opposed an immediate transfer to black majority rule before the colony had achieved sovereign statehood, and in November 1965 it unilaterally declared independence. Douglas-Home won the approval of left-wing Labour MPs such as Wedgwood Benn for his unwavering opposition to the rebel government, and for ignoring those on {{the right wing of the}} Conservative party who sympathised with the rebels on racial grounds.|$|E
5|$|In {{a sign of}} {{problems}} to come, three Spaniards passing through a region near the Peñol de Cerquín were attacked and killed. This area was considered pacified, and the attack deeply disturbed Montejo, since similar incidents during his conquest of Yucatán had been <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to general uprisings. He rushed {{to the scene of}} the attack with a strong force, and summoned all the native leaders to meet him, in an effort to forestall rebellion. He investigated the attack and meted out punishment to the most guilty, then continued with conciliatory policies towards the rest of the leaders, who reaffirmed their loyalty. Montejo let the leaders return to their people, then marched to Comayagua to reinforce Cáceres, before returning to Gracias a Dios.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the copper shark is viviparous, in which the yolk sac of the {{developing}} embryo, once depleted, is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Adult females have one functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites the female as <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> to mating. In the Southern Hemisphere, mating takes place from October to December (spring and early summer), when both sexes have migrated into offshore waters at higher latitudes. Birthing seems to occur from June to January, peaking in October and November.|$|E
