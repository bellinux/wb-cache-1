5|$|In 2016, two genetic {{studies of}} North American gray wolves {{found that they}} formed six {{ecotypes}} – genetically and ecologically distinct populations separated from other populations by their different type of habitat. These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, <b>Arctic,</b> <b>High</b> Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables. These findings were in accord with previous studies that precipitation influenced morphology and that vegetation and habitat type influenced wolf differences. The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf's preference {{to remain in the}} type of habitat that it was born into.|$|E

500|$|Due to its {{location}} in the Great Plains and its distance from both mountains and oceans, the city has a humid continental climate (Köppen (Dfb)), USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 4a. It has four very distinct seasons and great variation in temperatures over very short periods of time. As there are no nearby mountain ranges or bodies of water to ameliorate the climatic conditions, Grand Forks lies exposed to numerous weather systems, including bitterly cold <b>Arctic</b> <b>high</b> pressure systems. The city has long, cold, and snowy winters. Summers are often warm to hot and often quite humid with frequent thunderstorms. Although warm weather normally ends soon after Labor Day, a few warm days sometimes occur as late as October. Spring and autumn are short and highly variable seasons. Record temperature extremes range from [...] on January 11, 1912 to [...] on July 12, 1936.|$|E
500|$|In winter, North Carolina is {{somewhat}} {{protected by the}} Appalachian Mountains to the west. Cold fronts from Canada are typically reduced in intensity by the mountains. However, occasionally cold air can move from the north or northeast, east of the Appalachian Mountains, from <b>Arctic</b> <b>high</b> pressure systems that settle over the Northeastern or New England states. Other polar and Arctic outbreaks can cross the mountains and force temperatures to drop to about [...] in central North Carolina. Still, temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit are extremely rare outside of the mountains. The coldest ever recorded temperature in North Carolina was [...] on January 21, 1985, at Mount Mitchell. The winter temperatures on the coast are milder due to the warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream. The average ocean temperature in Southport in January is still {{higher than the average}} ocean temperature in Maine during July. Snow is common in the mountains, although many ski resorts use snowmaking equipment to make sure there is always snow on their land. North Carolina's relative humidity is highest in the winter.|$|E
500|$|Another {{significant}} snowfall hit the Raleigh area in January 2000 {{when more}} than [...] of snow fell. [...] There was also a heavy snowfall totaling [...] that hit the Wilmington area on December 22-23, 1989. This storm affected only the Southeastern US coast, {{as far south as}} Savannah, GA, with little to no snow measured west of I-95. [...] Most big snows that impact areas east of the mountains come from extratropical cyclones which approach from the south across Georgia and South Carolina and move off the coast of North or South Carolina. These storms typically throw Gulf or Atlantic moisture over cold Arctic air at ground level, usually propelled southward from <b>Arctic</b> <b>high</b> pressure over the Northeastern or New England states. If the storms track sufficiently far to the east, snow will be limited to {{the eastern part of the}} state (as with the December 22-23, 1989 storm). If the cyclones travel close to the coast, warm air will get pulled into eastern North Carolina due to increasing flow off the milder Atlantic Ocean, bringing a rain/snow line well inland with heavy snow restricted to the Piedmont, foothills and mountains, as with the January 22, 1987 storm. If the storm tracks inland into eastern North Carolina, the rain/snow line ranges between Raleigh and Greensboro.|$|E

50|$|On decadal {{and longer}} timescales, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) indices affect the flow {{pattern of the}} transpolar drift stream. During times of {{positive}} NAO (NAO+) and positive AO (AO+), there is a weak <b>Arctic</b> <b>high</b> and the associated surface winds produce a cyclonic (anti-clockwise) ice drift motion in eastern Arctic Ocean. In this case, the drift flows from the Laptev Sea towards the Beaufort Sea before exiting the Arctic Ocean through the Fram Strait. Conversely, during periods of NAO- and AO-, {{there is a strong}} <b>Arctic</b> <b>high</b> and ice motion flows in an anticyclonic (clockwise) motion in the Eurasian Basin. In this phase, the drift flows directly from the Laptev Sea through the Fram Strait.|$|E

Due to its location in the Canadian Prairies, and its distance from both mountains and oceans, it has an extreme humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb, USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 2b), in that there are great differences between summer and winter temperatures. The openness of the prairies leaves Winnipeg exposed to numerous weather systems including blizzards and cold <b>Arctic</b> <b>high</b> pressure systems, known as the polar high.

5000|$|Calm conditions, {{especially}} with clear skies, indicate {{the dominance of}} a high pressure area. Because highs are broad regions of descending air, they discourage the formation of phenomena typically associated with weather, such as clouds, wind, and precipitation. Calm conditions, though, may also result from a circumstance known as [...] "the calm before the storm," [...] in which a large thunderstorm cell to the west may be updrafting the westerly surface wind before it can arrive locally. This situation is readily identifiable by looking to the west - such an approaching storm will be close enough to be unmistakable.

50|$|This Barotropic {{vorticity}} equation assumes {{the atmosphere is}} nearly barotropic, {{which means that the}} direction and speed of the geostrophic wind are independent of height. In other words, there is no vertical wind shear of the geostrophic wind. It also implies that thickness contours (a proxy for temperature) are parallel to upper level height contours. In this type of atmosphere, high and low pressure areas are centers of warm and cold temperature anomalies. Warm-core highs (such as the subtropical ridge and Bermuda-Azores high) and cold-core lows have strengthening winds with height, with the reverse true for cold-core <b>highs</b> (shallow <b>arctic</b> <b>highs)</b> and warm-core lows (such as tropical cyclones).|$|R
5000|$|Grand Forks lies in {{the middle}} of the North American {{continent}} on low-lying, flat land. Since it is located in the Great Plains, it has an extreme continental climate, in that there are great differences between summer and winter temperatures. As there are no nearby mountain ranges or bodies of water to ameliorate the winter climatic conditions, Grand Forks lies exposed to numerous weather systems including bitterly cold <b>Arctic</b> <b>high</b> pressure systems. This can result in bone-chilling temperatures as early as the end of October, followed by bitter cold temperatures and readings during December, January and February. During these three months, the high reaches freezing on only 18 days, and the low falls below 0 F for 50 days per year. [...] Cold weather and snow will occasionally extend into April, although in general the winter weather begins to moderate in late February or early March. The lowest temperature ever recorded was -43 F, most recently on January 30, 2004.|$|E
5000|$|During March 11 and 12, 1993, {{temperatures}} {{over much}} of the eastern United States began to drop as an <b>arctic</b> <b>high</b> pressure system built over the Midwest and Great Plains. Concurrently, an extratropical area of low pressure formed over Mexico along a stationary front draped west to east. By the afternoon of March 12, a defined airmass boundary was present along the deepening low. Supported by a strong split-polar jet stream and a shortwave trough, the nascent system rapidly deepened. The system's central pressure fell to [...] by 00:00 UTC on March 13. A powerful low-level jet over eastern Cuba and the Gulf of Mexico enhanced a cold front extending from the low southward to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Furthermore, the subtropical jet stream was displaced unusually far south, reaching into the Pacific Ocean near Central America and extending toward Honduras and Jamaica. Intense ageostrophic flow was noted over the southern United States, with winds flowing perpendicular to isobars over Louisiana.|$|E
