5|$|When in 2002 {{another life}} {{sentence}} prisoner challenged the Home Secretary's power to set minimum terms, Hindley {{and hundreds of}} others, whose tariffs had been increased by politicians, looked likely {{to be released from}} prison. Hindley's release seemed imminent and plans were made by supporters for her to be given a new identity. Home Secretary David Blunkett ordered Greater Manchester Police to find new charges against her, to prevent her release from prison. The investigation was headed by Superintendent Tony Brett, and initially looked at charging Hindley with the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, but the advice given by government lawyers was that because of the DPP's decision taken 15 years earlier, a new trial would probably be considered an <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before May 2011, {{it was not}} {{possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin, the appellants contended that a declaration might be obtained in proceedings taken under Order 53 of the Rules of Court. The Court of Appeal, following Re Application by Dow Jones (Asia) Inc. (1987), held that it had no power to grant a declaration under Order 53 because a declaration is not a form of prerogative order. If a declaration was sought, it had to be applied for by way of writ if there were substantial factual disputes between the parties, or, if not, by originating summons. In Yip Kok Seng v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2010), the High Court expressed the view that due to the lack of a unified regime in Singapore for applying for prerogative orders and declarations, it was not an <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> for an applicant to seek redress for a public law right by way of a declaration instead of applying for a prerogative order.|$|E

He put it to the court that the videos showed inconsistencies with the evidence given by security guards and supported his version of events.|$|E
25|$|The {{court has}} a {{discretion}} regarding the above. Specifically, {{even if all}} the requirements are met, the court still has a discretion to refuse the application, as in the case, for example, of <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>process,</b> or when {{it will not be}} to the advantage of creditors, because there are not enough assets to cover the liabilities. Another example is Ex parte Logan.|$|E
25|$|As of July 2010, only Sandra Dowling {{had been}} {{successfully}} prosecuted. Indicted on 25 felony counts, Dowling eventually {{pleaded guilty to}} patronage for giving a summer job to her daughter, a single class-2 misdemeanor which was not among the original counts, although {{as part of the}} plea bargain she also agreed to recuse herself from the Maricopa County Regional School District. Dowling later filed suit, alleging negligence, malicious prosecution, <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> and several constitutional violations, although Arpaio won summary judgment against her claims.|$|E

50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{ordinary}} injunctions {{of the previous}} paragraph there also exist the so-called Mareva injunctions in Article 9(2). In common law, these are ex parte and in personam orders used to freeze assets (including bank accounts) to prevent <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> <b>process.</b> They can be issued as worldwide injunctions, preventing worldwide dispersal. In that case, their effectiveness depends on their in personam character, as a party who {{is found to be}} guilty of disposing of assets will be held to be in contempt of court. Like Anton Piller orders, their use is confined mostly to the UK.|$|R
25|$|On 11 May 1990, Magistrate Gurry ordered Einem {{to stand}} trial for the two murders of Alan Barnes and Mark Langley. Einem's defence counsel appealed the decision, {{launching}} an <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> action in the Supreme Court of South Australia to achieve a permanent stay of proceedings, as well as stating that the huge media interest in the charges would result in their client not getting a fair trial. Proceedings began on 19 June 1990 before Justice Kevin Duggan, and six months later on 17 December 1990, Justice Duggan released his findings. He ordered Einem {{to stand trial}}, however he expressed concerns {{with most of the}} prosecution's evidence.|$|E
25|$|Mote {{appealed the}} {{decision}} of Portsmouth Crown Court to the Court of Appeal on two main grounds. First, that he had applied to the European Court of Justice to have his immunity as an MEP upheld {{and that it was}} an <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> for the Crown Court not to have suspended the case pending its decision. Second, that the fact the jury had convicted him on 21 counts of fraud and acquitted him on 4 counts was inconsistent. Giving his judgment, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, stated that Portsmouth Crown Court had correctly decided that {{there was no need to}} wait for the CFI's decision, noting in any case that it was unlikely the CFI would differ in its final judgment from {{the decision of}} the European Parliament. On the second ground of appeal, the Court did, however, quash one of the counts of fraud - that of failing to notify.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, proponents {{of a more}} [...] "closed" [...] and {{restrictive}} system of rules of standing point towards the need for increased certainty in the law, {{as well as the}} possibility of <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> and the conventional argument that there will be an unstoppable flood of litigation. Additionally, it is argued that allowing more applications by persons with weak claims to standing may curtail the efficiency of the executive in practising good governance, as resources would have to be channelled to defending lawsuits. It may also delay the implementation of administrative decisions, potentially resulting in substantial damage to stakeholders involved.|$|E
50|$|With {{the mandate}} of the House, Abdulmumin also led the Finance Committee to launch a {{comprehensive}} investigation into the Insurance industry and insurance of government asset and properties where wide-ranging discoveries were made bothering on issues <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>processes</b> and existing laws. The Committee has commenced work to repeal and re-enact the existing insurance law. In the same vein, Abdulmumin proceeded to look into tax compliance and remittances by various sectors of the economy. Specifically, the Committee also commenced investigation of tax compliance by banks. This will review the role of the banks as tax collecting agents and tax-payers.|$|R

50|$|Joly v Pelletier is a 1999 Ontario Superior Court of Justice {{case that}} dealt with the {{requirements}} of legal standing and vexatious litigants. The plaintiff, Rene Joly, filed a lawsuit in that was dismissed by Justice Epstein as frivolous or vexatious or an <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> the Court.|$|R
500|$|The book {{begins with}} a {{discussion}} of targeted killing of non-combatants, followed by discussions of legalities, the rationale of self-defence, the choice of targets, and when and whether the ends can be used to justify the means. Several contributors defend targeting of non-combatants, while Jeremy Waldron discusses the morality associated with the tactic and argues against its use. Jeff McMahan identifies the problematic nature of targeted killing and emphasizes regulations for law enforcement to avoid <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>process.</b> Richard V. Meyer writes that any entity wishing to carry out targeted killing should first have to declare war on the targeted parties. [...] Kevin H. Govern examines the elimination of Osama Bin Laden and identifies this killing as justified and the product of a rational decision-making process. In the final portion of the book, Fernando Tesón says that targeted killing is particularly justified against terrorists because they use tactics specifically designed to kill civilians.|$|E
500|$|He {{said that}} there were three {{justifications}} for the immunity given in the caselaw and in argument. [...] Firstly, there was the [...] "chilling effect" [...] of such claims, making witnesses reluctant to give frank evidence or to provide expert evidence at all; secondly, the risk that an expert witness would be reluctant to comply with his paramount duty to the court if to do so involved giving evidence contrary to his client's interest with a risk of being sued for doing so. Thirdly, it was [...] "undesirable" [...] that a court hearing a claim for negligence against an expert witness should have to decide whether the court that decided the claim in which the expert gave evidence reached the correct decision. [...] This argument was not {{at the forefront of the}} defendant's arguments, but was one that Lord Phillips said should not be wholly discounted. He noted that a claim based on an alleged wrongful conviction as the result of an expert's negligence would be struck out as an <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> unless the conviction had been overturned, under the rule in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police.|$|E
2500|$|... "The use of {{nolle prosequi}} {{to conceal the}} {{deficiencies}} of the prosection was an <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>process,</b> which left an innocent man under the suspicion that {{there might have been}} something in the talk of mass murder after all" ...|$|E
25|$|Whether the {{complaint}} is an <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> the <b>process.</b> If {{the claim is}} inappropriate or {{considered to be a}} waste of the Committee's time (such as frivolous claims or claims that have already been rejected by the Committee or another international mechanism) then it will be considered inadmissible.|$|R

2500|$|On 15 December 2009 Justice Debbie Mullins of the Queensland Supreme Court {{ruled that}} there had been an <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> and stayed the {{indictment}} against Moti. She held that [...] "questions about the integrity of the administration of the Australian justice system [...] when witnesses who live in a foreign country, expected to be fully supported by the Australian Government until they gave evidence at the trial in Australia." ...|$|E
2500|$|Defamation is {{tarnishing}} {{the reputation}} of someone; it has two varieties, slander and libel. Slander is spoken defamation and libel is printed or broadcast defamation. [...] The two otherwise share the same features: making a factual assertion for which evidence does not exist. Defamation does not affect or hinder the voicing of opinions, but does occupy the same fields as rights to free speech in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, or Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Related to defamation in the U.S. are the actions for misappropriation of publicity, invasion of privacy, and disclosure. <b>Abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> and malicious prosecution are often classified as dignitary torts as well.|$|E
2500|$|Another case {{covering}} {{this area is}} Assessment Technologies v. Wiredata (2003), in which the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a copyright holder in a compilation of public domain data cannot use that copyright to prevent others from using the underlying public domain data, but may only restrict the specific format of the compilation, if that format is itself sufficiently creative. [...] Assessment Technologies also held {{that it is a}} fair use of a copyrighted work to reverse engineer that work in order to gain access to uncopyrightable facts. [...] Assessment Technologies also created new law, stating that it is a copyright misuse and an <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> if one attempts to use a contract or license agreement based on one's copyright to protect uncopyrightable facts.|$|E
50|$|The term is {{not defined}} in statute law, {{but has been}} defined in legal cases. One of the {{earliest}} cases was Keaveney v. Geraghty, where the plaintiff's libel proceedings were stayed {{on the grounds that}} they were frivolous, vexatious, and an <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> the court. The plaintiff was effectively declared a vexatious litigant.|$|R

2500|$|In December 2011, the High Court of Australia {{ordered a}} stay of charges, ruling that Australian officials' {{participation}} in Moti's extradition from the Solomons had been unlawful under Solomon Islands law. Summarising its ruling, the court said: [...] "Further {{prosecution of the}} charges would be an <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> because of the role that Australian officials in Mr Moti being deported to Australia". This was a permanent stay of prosecution {{putting an end to}} all court proceedings against Moti; the ruling was a majority decision of six judges to one. Manasseh Sogavare stated, in response to the ruling: [...] "I am so pleased. This matter has hung like a dark cloud over me and my government. This decision has vindicated me".|$|E
2500|$|Moore {{then brought}} an {{action in the}} United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas for civil {{liability}} under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), against the prosecutor and five postal inspectors. His complaint raised five causes of action, including {{the claim that the}} prosecutor and the inspectors had engineered his criminal prosecution in retaliation for criticism of the Postal Service, thus violating the First Amendment. [...] Moore argued that the postal inspectors launched a criminal investigation against him well before any suspicion of the two schemes actually arose, that the inspectors targeted him for his lobbying activities, and that they pressured the United States Attorney's Office to have him indicted. [...] He also sought recovery from the federal government of the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). The District Court dismissed the claims against the Assistant United States Attorney in accordance with the absolute immunity for prosecutorial judgment, and rejected an <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>process</b> claim against the inspectors.|$|E
2500|$|Reforms {{are made}} {{to the extent to}} which the defence must {{disclose}} their case in order to trigger both the revised duty to disclose and the right to a [...] "section 8" [...] application to the court to force the prosecution to disclose an item of evidence. A defence statement must now state each point at which issue is taken with the prosecution and why, any particular defence or points of law (such as evidential admissibility or <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>process)</b> upon which he or she would rely. The defendant must also give a list of defence witnesses, along with their names and addresses. The police may then interview those witnesses, according to a code of practice issued by the Home Secretary. The Explanatory Notes make it clear the police interviewing of potential defence witnesses is one of the intents of the Act. The details of any defence expert witness instructed must also be given to the prosecution, whether or not they are then used in the case. However, no part of the Act explicitly amends the law on legal privilege, so the contents of any correspondence or expert report would remain confidential to the same extent as before.|$|E

50|$|A further {{complication}} {{turned on}} the fact that Davis might never have been committed for trial from the lower courts had blood test results been disclosed at the committal stage.
