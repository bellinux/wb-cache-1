5|$|The {{cause of}} Domery's {{appetite}} is not known. While {{there are other}} documented cases of similar behaviour from this period none of the subjects other than Domery's contemporary Tarrare were autopsied, {{and there have been}} no modern documented cases of polyphagia (excessive appetite) as extreme as Domery. Hyperthyroidism can induce an extreme appetite and rapid weight loss, while Bondeson(2006) speculates that Domery possibly suffered from a damaged <b>amygdala</b> or ventromedial nucleus; it is known that injuries to the <b>amygdala</b> or ventromedial nucleus in animals can induce polyphagia.|$|E
5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The <b>amygdala,</b> orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and <b>amygdala</b> in fear.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{original}} discovery in the rabbit hippocampus, LTP {{has been observed}} {{in a variety of}} other neural structures, including the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, <b>amygdala,</b> and many others. Robert Malenka, a prominent LTP researcher, has suggested that LTP may even occur at all excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain.|$|E
50|$|There {{seems to}} be a {{connection}} with the <b>amygdalae</b> and how the brain processes posttraumatic stress disorder. Multiple studies have found that the <b>amygdalae</b> may be responsible for the emotional reactions of PTSD patients. One study in particular found that when PTSD patients are shown pictures of faces with fearful expressions, their <b>amygdalae</b> tended to have a higher activation than someone without PTSD.|$|R
5000|$|Located {{above the}} {{hippocampus}} in the medial temporal lobes are two <b>amygdalae</b> (singular [...] "amygdala"). The <b>amygdalae</b> {{are associated with}} both emotional learning and memory, as it responds strongly to emotional stimuli, especially fear. These neurons assist in encoding emotional memories and enhancing them. This process results in emotional events being more deeply and accurately encoded into memory. Lesions to the <b>amygdalae</b> in monkeys {{have been shown to}} impair motivation, as well as the processing of emotions.|$|R
40|$|Brain {{volumetric}} studies {{reveal that}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) infection is associated with significant changes in several neural regions, including enlargements in the <b>amygdalae,</b> which are small sub-cortical structures located deep within {{the left and right}} temporal lobes that contribute to social behavior. Research on healthy individuals has shown a positive correlation exists between <b>amygdalae</b> volumes and social network size. However, there is evidence that larger <b>amygdalae</b> volumes are associated with increased psychiatric difficulties. The present study investigated the relation of <b>amygdalae</b> volumes and activation to social network size in HIV patients. It was predicted that HIV participants would demonstrate <b>amygdalae</b> enlargement and hyperactivity, and that this would correlate with reduced social interactions. The Social Network Index (SNI), a self-report measure that assesses involvement in eight social domains, was administered to 14 HIV positive (HIV) and 7 healthy control (HC) individuals. The psychological profiles of the groups were character-ized using several self-report questionnaires, measuring current stress levels, mood, rates of interpersonal difficulties, and alexithymia. High resolution anatomical magnetic resonances images (MRI), obtained using a 3 -Tesla scanner, were used to quantify <b>amygdalae</b> volumes. Participants viewed black and white images of an...|$|R
5|$|The {{cause of}} Tarrare's {{behaviour}} is not known. While {{there are other}} documented cases of similar behaviour from the period, none of the subjects other than Tarrare were autopsied {{and there have been}} no modern documented cases resembling Tarrare. Hyperthyroidism can induce an extreme appetite, rapid weight loss, profuse sweating, heat intolerance, and fine hair. Bondeson (2006) speculates that Tarrare suffered from a damaged amygdala; it is known that injuries to the <b>amygdala</b> in animals can induce polyphagia.|$|E
5|$|The {{human brain}} has many {{properties}} {{that are common}} to all vertebrate brains, and shares many features common to all mammalian brains, most notably a six-layered cerebral cortex {{and a set of}} associated structures, including the hippocampus and <b>amygdala.</b> The cortex is proportionally larger in greater mammals and humans than many other animals. Humans have more association cortex, sensory and motor parts than other mammals such as the rat and the cat.|$|E
5|$|The {{ventral tegmental area}} (VTA) {{is another}} {{midbrain}} area. The most prominent group of VTA dopaminergic neurons projects to the prefrontal cortex via the mesocortical pathway and another smaller group projects to the nucleus accumbens via the mesolimbic pathway. Together, these two pathways are collectively termed the mesocorticolimbic projection. The VTA also sends dopaminergic projections to the <b>amygdala,</b> cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. Mesocorticolimbic neurons {{play a central role}} in reward and other aspects of motivation.|$|E
40|$|The <b>amygdalae</b> are {{involved}} in the perception of emotions such as happiness, anger and fear. Because of their proximity to the sinuses, the image signal intensity in T 2 * weighted fMRI data is often affected by signal loss due to through-slice dephasing, especially at high field strength. In this study, the feasibility of fMRI in the <b>amygdalae</b> at 7 Tesla was investigated. A paradigm based on the presentation of fearful faces was used for stimulation. Previously, opposite effects have been found for presentation of averted and direct gaze fearful faces. Here, we show that (1) sufficiently high temporal SNR values are reached in the <b>amygdalae</b> for detection of small BOLD signal changes and (2) that the BOLD signal in the <b>amygdalae</b> for presentation of a direct or averted gaze in a fearful face depends on stimulus duration...|$|R

5|$|Size, however, is not {{the only}} difference: there are also {{substantial}} differences in shape. The hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates, but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain, which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure. The cerebral cortex is {{the part of the brain}} that most strongly distinguishes mammals. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the surface of the cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple three-layered structure called the pallium. In mammals, the pallium evolves into a complex six-layered structure called neocortex or isocortex. Several areas at the edge of the neocortex, including the hippocampus and <b>amygdala,</b> are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The {{intermediate}} hippocampus has overlapping characteristics {{with both}} the ventral and dorsal hippocampus. Using anterograde tracing methods, Cenquizca and Swanson (2007) located the moderate projections to two primary olfactory cortical areas and prelimbic areas of the medial prefrontal cortex. This region has the smallest number of place cells. The ventral hippocampus functions in fear conditioning and affective processes. Anagnostaras et al. (2002) showed that alterations to the ventral hippocampus reduced {{the amount of information}} sent to the <b>amygdala</b> by the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, consequently altering fear conditioning in rats.|$|E
5|$|The term {{limbic system}} was {{introduced}} in 1952 by Paul MacLean to describe the set of structures that line {{the edge of the}} cortex (Latin limbus meaning border): These include the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, olfactory cortex, and <b>amygdala.</b> Paul MacLean later suggested that the limbic structures comprise the neural basis of emotion. The hippocampus is anatomically connected to parts of the brain that are involved with emotional behavior—the septum, the hypothalamic mammillary body, and the anterior nuclear complex in the thalamus, and is generally accepted {{to be part of the}} limbic system.|$|E

5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{is connected}} by the brainstem to the spinal cord. The brainstem {{consists of the}} midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The cerebellum {{is connected to the}} brainstem by pairs of tracts. Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system, consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures, including the thalamus, the epithalamus, the pineal gland, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the subthalamus; the limbic structures, including the <b>amygdala</b> and the hippocampus; the claustrum, the various nuclei of the basal ganglia; the basal forebrain structures, and the three circumventricular organs. The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells. There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain, and a more or less equal number of other cells. Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses. Neurons form elaborate neural networks of neural pathways and circuits. The whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
5|$|The strepsirrhine rhinarium {{can collect}} {{relatively}} non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as pheromones) and transmit {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located below {{and in front of}} the nasal cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory olfactory bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to the <b>amygdala,</b> which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main olfactory system.|$|E
25|$|The <b>amygdala</b> {{probably}} {{plays a role}} in {{the conscious}} processing of emotion. The left <b>amygdala</b> was activated during the processing of conscious stimuli while the right <b>amygdala</b> was active during the processing of nonconscous stimuli.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{patients}} with ASD have overactive right <b>amygdalae</b> and pre-frontal cortices, both structures {{that are involved in}} the fear-processing pathway.|$|R
50|$|They are {{connected}} {{to other parts of}} the brain (as shown in the schematic, below left), and act as a relay for impulses coming from the <b>amygdalae</b> and hippocampi, via the mamillo-thalamic tract to the thalamus.|$|R

25|$|Neural {{circuitry}} {{involving the}} <b>amygdala</b> (which regulates emotions like anxiety and fear, stimulating the HPA Axis and sympathetic nervous system) and hippocampus (which is implicated in emotional memory {{along with the}} <b>amygdala)</b> is thought to underlie anxiety. People who have anxiety tend to show high activity in response to emotional stimuli in the <b>amygdala.</b> Some writers believe that excessive anxiety can lead to an overpotentiation of the limbic system (which includes the <b>amygdala</b> and nucleus accumbens), giving increased future anxiety, {{but this does not}} appear to have been proven.|$|E
25|$|Using a PET scan, {{researchers}} found that activity in the left medial and lateral prefrontal cortex was reciprocally associated with decrease activity in the <b>amygdala.</b> These findings imply that the prefrontal cortex modulates the <b>amygdala</b> activity. The left prefronatal cortex {{plays a role in}} approach behaviors (positively valenced emotions), while the <b>amygdala</b> plays a role in withdrawal behaviors (negatively valenced emotions).|$|E

50|$|Amygdalohippocampectomy is a {{surgical}} procedure {{for the treatment}} of epilepsy. It consists of the removal of the hippocampus, which has a role in memory, spatial awareness, and navigation, and the <b>amygdalae,</b> which have a role in the processing and memory of emotional reactions, both structures forming part of the limbic system of the brain.|$|R
5000|$|Additional to the {{processing}} of memory and emotion, the <b>amygdalae</b> have important roles as “relevance detectors" [...] for the discernment of relevant social information. [...] Therefore, these brain regions that deal with social relevance and vocal emotion are probable candidates for a neural network concerning accent-based group membership that would drive the affective processing of accents.|$|R
25|$|The <b>amygdala</b> {{plays a role}} in the {{conscious}} awareness of emotion (feelings) resulting in perception of feeling, but experiments suggest the left and right <b>amygdala</b> have distinct roles in conscious and unconscious processing of emotion. The right <b>amygdala</b> {{plays a role in}} the nonconscious processing of emotion while the left <b>amygdala</b> was involved in the processing of conscious emotions. These results were obtained from studies that masked conditioning stimuli. Stimuli were presented over {{a very short period of}} time such that subjects were not consciously aware of the stimuli but were still able to show physiological changes.|$|E
25|$|The {{consolidation}} of memory requires the synthesis (creation) of certain proteins in the <b>amygdala.</b> Disruption of protein synthesis in the <b>amygdala</b> {{has been shown}} to prevent long-term memory for fear conditioning. Anisomycin inhibits the production of proteins. In tests where it is delivered to the lateral and basal nuclei in the <b>amygdala</b> of rats, the rats demonstrated that they had forgotten fear responses that they had been conditioned to display.|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} frontal gyrus, medial frontal areas, intraparietal sulcus, {{and superior}} parietal cortex, areas involved in sophisticated mental activity, show equal activity in REM sleep as in wakefulness. The <b>amygdala</b> is also active during REM sleep and may participate in generating the PGO waves, and experimental {{suppression of the}} <b>amygdala</b> results in less REM sleep. The <b>amygdala</b> may also cardiac function {{in lieu of the}} less active insular cortex.|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} examines whether cognitive load can modulate {{the processing of}} negative emotional stimuli, even after negative stimuli have already activated emotional centers of the brain. In a {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) study, participants viewed neutral and negative stimuli that were followed by an attention-demanding arithmetic task. As expected, exposure to negative stimuli led to increased activation in emotional regions (the <b>amygdalae</b> and the right insula). Subsequently induced task load led to increased activation in cognitive regions (right dorsolateral frontal cortex, right superior parietal cortex). Importantly, task load down-regulated the brain's response to negative stimuli in emotional regions. Task load also reduced subjectively experienced negative emotion in response to negative stimuli. Finally, coactivation analyses suggest that during task performance, activity in right dorsolateral frontal cortex was related to activity in the <b>amygdalae</b> and the right insula. Together, these findings indicate that cognitive load is capable of tuning down the emotional brain. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
