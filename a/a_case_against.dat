5|$|In 1963, three African-American {{students}} brought <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> the Mobile County School Board {{for being}} denied admission to Murphy High School. This was {{nearly a decade}} after the United States Supreme Court had ruled in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. The federal district court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County's school system.|$|E
5|$|Indiana put further {{restrictions}} on African Americans, prohibiting them from testifying {{in court in}} <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> a white man. The new constitution of 1851 expanded suffrage for white males, but excluded blacks from suffrage. While the state did not have legal segregation, it excluded black children from public schools {{as a matter of}} custom.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, the EU Commission Directorate-General for Competition made a {{preliminary}} decision against Ecclestone and the FIA.

5|$|Guest {{was born}} in Grahamstown, Cape Colony. His {{grandfather}} had moved the family there, leaving Kidderminster, England, {{where it had been}} in the printing business for three generations. He saw active service in the Second Boer War, enlisting despite being underage, and again in the First World War, when he was injured in France. His legal career began while back in Southern Rhodesia between those two wars. He won <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Sir Charles Coghlan, at the time Premier of Southern Rhodesia, and Coghlan invited him to become a partner in his firm, which became known as Coghlan, Welsh & Guest. On his return from the First World War, Guest took responsibility for the Salisbury practice.|$|E
5|$|In 1203 John was {{employed}} in pleading at Rome on the Hubert Walter's behalf in <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Gerald of Wales. While returning from Rome, John was captured and held for ransom. He informed his captors that Gerald {{would also be}} passing by, thus ensuring Gerald's capture. Gerald's revenge was to inform the kidnappers that John's income was over 100 marks a year, which meant that the kidnappers required a large ransom before releasing John. John was eventually rescued by John Bellesmains, a fellow Englishman and former Archbishop of Lyon.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Woods and golfer Arnold Palmer {{initiated}} <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Bruce Matthews (the {{owner of}} Gotta Have It Golf, Inc.) {{and others in}} the effort to stop the unauthorized sale of their images and alleged signatures in the memorabilia market. Matthews and associated parties counterclaimed that Woods and his company, ETW Corporation, committed several acts including breach of contract, breach of implied duty of good faith, and violations of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. Palmer was also named in the counter-suit, accused of violating the same licensing agreement in conjunction with his company Arnold Palmer Enterprises.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, {{the club}} was {{purchased}} by London Clubs, who moved their premises from the Devonshire Club on St James's Street to {{the basement of the}} Ritz. A new company was formed in June 1998, the Ritz Hotel Casino Ltd., which was granted legal permission to open a casino. After very quick refurbishment, it reopened on 12 September with exclusive membership, although members are permitted to invite a guest. As of 2006 the Ritz Club was divided into four main areas—the restaurant, bar, lounge and the private gaming room, situated in the former Banqueting Hall. In July 2014, London High Court heard <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> the club, in which Nora Al-Daher claimed she was 'taken advantage' of and asked for £2 million in losses.|$|E
5|$|Moss was {{the founder}} and {{director}} of Moss Electrical Co Ltd, and owned 950 of the 1,000 available shares. In September 1986 he said that Hunter, the finance director, could have 50 of these shares as part of his employment. Crucially, he made no statement or trust involving the other 900 shares. This gift of 50 shares was never implemented because of tax concerns, the risks of a takeover, and mainly because Moss changed his mind. Hunter brought <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Moss claiming his 50 shares, which rested on two issues. First, whether the language used was sufficient to create a trust, and second, whether or not the trust failed to provide the three certainties {{because of the lack of}} segregation between the shares.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{after hearing}} <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Cumanus in Iudaea, Quadratus sent him, {{along with several}} Jewish and Samaritan leaders {{including}} the High Priest Ananias, to plead their cases in Rome before the Emperor Claudius. At the hearing, several of Claudius' influential freedmen officials took the side of Cumanus. However, the Jews were supported by Agrippa II, a friend of Claudius whose father, Agrippa I, had been the last king of Iudaea before the province was placed under Roman procurators. Whether influenced by court politics or not, Claudius decided in favour of the Jewish side. The Samaritan leaders were executed and Cumanus was sent into exile. Felix succeeded him as procurator of Iudaea. Cumanus' life and career after his banishment are unknown.|$|E

5|$|The Cambridge Water Company were {{a company}} {{responsible}} for providing potable water to the inhabitants of Cambridge and the surrounding areas. In 1976, they purchased a borehole outside Sawston to deal with rising demand. In 1980, a European Directive was issued requiring nations of the European Community to establish standards {{on the presence of}} perchloroethene (PCE) in water, which the United Kingdom did in 1982. It was found that the Sawston borehole was contaminated with PCE that had originated in a tannery owned by Eastern Counties Leather. Prior to 1980, there was no knowledge that PCE should be avoided or that it could cause harm, but the Cambridge Water Company brought <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Eastern Counties Leather anyway.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, Meir Abergil {{was freed}} and {{returned}} to Israel after having served about {{three years in prison}} first in Israel and then in the United States. Charged with blackmailing U.S. businessmen to whom the brothers had lent money, he allegedly had played a relatively minor role in the crimes and is thought to have been involved mainly in the extortion of Asi Vaknin, who was arrested in Mexico and brought to the United States in April 2011, but refuses to testify against the Abergils. As a result, U.S. authorities reportedly were not able to build <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Meir Abergil, leading to a plea agreement approved by a California court in which Abergil confessed to extortion of over a million dollars from another mob figure. In Israel, he faces criminal charges pending against him in the district court in Petah Tikva over allegations regarding his involvement in an Internet gambling business set up about 10 years ago which operated in many locations in Israel, including Internet cafes, convenience stores, soccer lottery outlets and nightclubs functioning as casinos. According to his lawyer, Abergil′s involvement in the alleged activities was marginal.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{as in the}} UK, the Hicklin test of {{obscenity}} applied, but New York {{case law}} had established that books should be judged by their effects on adults rather than on children and that literary merit was relevant. Ernst obtained statements from authors including Dreiser, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Sinclair Lewis, Sherwood Anderson, H. L. Mencken, Upton Sinclair, Ellen Glasgow and John Dos Passos. Besides, freedom of expression was protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. To make sure these supporters did not go unheard, he incorporated their opinions into his brief. His argument relied on a comparison with Mademoiselle de Maupin by Théophile Gautier, which had been cleared of obscenity in the 1922 case Halsey v. New York. Mademoiselle de Maupin described a lesbian relationship in more explicit terms than The Well did. According to Ernst, The Well had greater social value because it was more serious in tone and made <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> misunderstanding and intolerance.|$|E

5|$|Indictment against Blythe {{was brought}} by State Attorney Vladimír Mužík. Mužík had tried {{a number of}} murderers, such as Luboš Mika (life in prison), Roman Fidler (life {{imprisonment}} at 1st instance, 25 years on appeal), Maria Zolotukinová (13 years imprisonment) and Petr Procházka (11 years imprisonment). He also tried <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Andranik Soghojan, an alleged head of Russian mafia, requesting 25 {{years in prison for}} ordering a murder. The Municipal Court in Prague acquitted Soghojan due to lack of evidence; however, the decision was repealed on appeal by the High Court, and the case will be heard again by a different tribunal of the Municipal Court. Another of Mužík's murder cases which ended in acquittal due to insufficient evidence is that of Miroslav Rus, who was indicted in connection with disappearance of Miroslav Kříž, a vice-chairman of the Czech Football Association.|$|E
5|$|Martin next awakes in Doggett's home. Wells tells Doggett the {{description}} of the killer but the man isn’t in lock-up yet because that won’t happen until Wednesday. Doggett and Wells arrive at the apartment and retrieve the nanny cam, but discover that someone disabled the cam and used its remote control, a device no one knew about except Mr. and Mrs. Wells and their nanny, Trina Galvez. At Trina Galvez’s home, Wells and Doggett discover the killer, a man named Cesar Ocampo, who threatened to kill Galvez's family if she refused him entrance. At the station house, Doggett informs Wells that Ocampo only wants to talk to him. Ocampo reveals that his brother, Hector, was sentenced to time in prison for a false conviction. Wells bargains with Cesar Ocampo, saying that if Cesar confesses to Vicky’s murder, he will take a look at his brother’s case. Cesar tells him that Hector hung himself in a jail cell a few weeks ago. Doggett calls Martin Wells out into the hall and the police arrest Martin because they have <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> him. Evidence against Ocampo isn’t strong enough yet.|$|E
5|$|Sometime later, Bud confronts Gekko in Central Park. Gekko {{physically}} assaults Bud as he berates him for {{his role}} with Bluestar and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud has turned state's evidence and was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the wire tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for helping them make <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Gekko. Later on, Bud's parents drive him down FDR Drive towards the New York State Supreme Court Building downtown to answer for the crimes he committed under Gekko's influence. Carl tells him he did right in saving the airline. The film ends with Bud going up {{the steps of the}} courthouse, knowing that while he is likely going to prison and his career is ruined, he now has a clear conscience.|$|E

5|$|The Cambridge Water Company brought <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Eastern Counties Leather in the High Court of Justice, wanting £1 {{million in}} damages {{for the cost of}} finding a new {{borehole}} and an unsuccessful attempt to decontaminate the original one, and an injunction to prevent any more use of PCE. They argued that Eastern Counties Leather were liable in three ways; first, in negligence, second, in nuisance, and third, under the rule developed in Rylands v Fletcher. The case came before Kennedy J, who dismissed all three of the Company's claims. On the matter of negligence, he held that the damage had to be reasonably foreseeable, as was required under Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd; he applied this same test to the claim under nuisance. Applying the case of Hughes v Lord Advocate, Kennedy found that the harm was not reasonably foreseeable, and both actions under nuisance and negligence must fail.|$|E
