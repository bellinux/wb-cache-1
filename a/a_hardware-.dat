First, we present an evolutionary algorithm that automatically determines the quantities {{and types of}} system resources, assigns tasks to different potentially reconfigurable processing elements, and assigns communication events to communication resources. Second, we propose a dynamic priority multirate scheduling algorithm to determine the times at which all the tasks and communication events in the system occur. This two-dimensional scheduling algorithm determines task priorities based on real-time constraints and detailed frame-by-frame FPGA reconfiguration overhead information. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} proposed method reduces schedule length by an average of 34. 3 % and reconfiguration energy by an average of 40. 4 %, compared to a method that does not consider the effect of partial reconfiguration during synthesis.

40|$|Speculative {{parallel}} discrete event simulation {{requires a}} support for reversing processed events, also called state recovery, when causal inconsistencies are revealed. In {{this article we}} present an approach where state recovery relies on <b>a</b> mix of <b>hardware-</b> and software-based techniques. We exploit the Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) support, as offered by Intel Haswell CPUs, to process events as in-memory transactions, which are possibly committed only after their causal consistency is verified. At the same time, we exploit an innovative software-based reversibility technique, fully relying on transparent software instrumentation targeting x 86 /ELF objects, which enables undoing side effects by events with no actual backward re-computation. Each thread within our speculative processing engine dynamically (on a per-event basis) selects which recovery mode to rely on (hardware vs software) depending on varying runtime dynamics. The latter are captured by a lightweight analytic model indicating {{to what extent the}} HTM support (not paying any instrumentation cost) is efficient, and after what level of events’ parallelism it starts degrading its performance, e. g., due to excessive data conflicts while manipulating causality meta-data within HTM-based transactions.

40|$|Reductions of {{hardware}} costs {{as well as}} implementations of new innovative functions are the main drivers of today’s automotive electronics. Indeed more and more resources are spent on adapting existing solutions to different environments. At the same time, due to {{the increasing number of}} networked components, a level of complexity has been reached which is difficult to handle using traditional development processes. The automotive industry addresses this problem through a paradigm shift from <b>a</b> <b>hardware-,</b> component-driven to a requirement- and function-driven development process, and a stringent standardization of infrastructure elements. One central standardization initiative is the AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture (AUTOSAR). AUTOSAR was founded in 2003 by major OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers and now includes a large number of automotive, electronics, semiconductor, hard- and software companies. AUTOSAR aims at facilitating the re-use of soft- and hardware components between different vehicle platforms, OEMs and suppliers. To achieve this, AUTOSAR defines a methodology that supports a distributed, function-driven development process and standardizes the software-architecture for each ECU in such a system. AUTOSAR also specifies compatible software-interfaces at application-level. This paper gives an overview of the AUTOSAR initiative, its goals, partners and members, and roadmap.

40|$|Abstract—Developers of {{embedded}} (real-time) {{systems can}} choose {{from a variety of}} operating systems. While some embedded operating systems provide very flexible APIs, e. g., a POSIX-compliant interface for run-time management, others have a completely static structure, which is generated at compile time by utilizing detailed application knowledge. A prominent example for the latter class from the domain of automotive operating systems is OSEK/OS and its successor AUTOSAR/OS. As we have shown in previous work, the design of the operating system has a strong impact on its vulnerability for system failure caused by hardware faults. This observation is gaining importance, because there is an ongoing trend towards low-power and low-cost, yet less reliable, hardware. This work quantifies the difference in vulnerability for soft errors in main memory of a flexible (dynamic) operating systems (eCos) and a static system (CiAO), which has an OSEK-compliant structure. We also analyze the additional degree of robustness that is achieved by hardening an operating system with software-based and hardware-based fault-tolerance measures and the corresponding costs. Covering this design space gives developers a better chance for good design decisions with respect to the trade-off between fault tolerance, resource consumption, and interface convenience. Our results indicate that with <b>a</b> combination of <b>hardware-</b> and software-based fault-tolerance measures, silent data corruptions in both operating systems can be reduced to below one percent (compared to eCos). However, the analyzed fault-tolerance mechanisms are expensive for the dynamic system, whereas the statically designed operating system can be hardened at much lower price. I...|$|R
40|$|Integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), autonomy, spacecraft, {{and other}} {{aviation}} technologies, in the airspace {{is becoming more}} and more complicated, and will continue to do so in the future. Inclusion of new technology and complexity into the airspace increases the importance and difficulty of safety assurance. Additionally, testing new technologies on complex aviation systems and systems of systems can be challenging, expensive, and at times unsafe when implementing real life scenarios. The application of prognostics to aviation and airspace management may produce new tools and insight into these problems. Prognostic methodology provides an estimate of the health and risks of a component, vehicle, or airspace and knowledge of how that will change over time. That measure is especially useful in safety determination, mission planning, and maintenance scheduling. In our research, we develop <b>a</b> live, distributed, <b>hardware-</b> in-the-loop Prognostics Virtual Laboratory testbed for aviation and airspace prognostics. The developed testbed will be used to validate prediction algorithms for the real-time safety monitoring of the National Airspace System (NAS) and the prediction of unsafe events. In our earlier work 1 we discussed the initial Prognostics Virtual Laboratory testbed development work and related results for milestones 1 & 2. This paper describes the design, development, and testing of the integrated tested which are part of milestone 3, along with our next steps for validation of this work. Through a framework consisting of software/hardware modules and associated interface clients, the distributed testbed enables safe, accurate, and inexpensive experimentation and research into airspace and vehicle prognosis that would not have been possible otherwise. The testbed modules can be used cohesively to construct complex and relevant airspace scenarios for research. Four modules are key to this research: the virtual aircraft module which uses the X-Plane simulator and X-PlaneConnect toolbox, the live aircraft module which connects fielded aircraft using onboard cellular communications devices, the hardware in the loop (HITL) module which connects laboratory based bench-top hardware testbeds and the research module which contains diagnostics and prognostics tools for analysis of live air traffic situations and vehicle health conditions.

Tracking at trigger level is an essential tool to control the rate in high-pileup conditions while maintaining a good efficiency for relevant physics processes. The Fast TracKer (FTK) {{is an integral part of}} the trigger upgrade for the ATLAS detector. For every event passing the Level 1 trigger (at a maximum rate of 100 kHz) the FTK receives data from the 80 million channels of the silicon detectors, providing tracking information to the High Level Trigger in order to ensure a selection robust against pile-up. The FTK performs <b>a</b> <b>hardware-</b> based track reconstruction, using associative memory (AM) that is based on the use of a custom chip, designed to perform pattern matching at very high speed.

To optimise this choice, the feature of variable resolution of the roads is implemented via ternary bits in the AM logic.

The optimum driving dynamics can be achieved only when the tire forces on all four wheels and in all three coordinate directions are monitored and controlled precisely. This advanced level of control is possible only when a vehicle is equipped with several active chassis control systems that are networked together in an integrated fashion. To investigate such capabilities, an electric vehicle model has been developed with four direct-drive in-wheel motors and an active steering system. Using this vehicle model, an advanced slip control system, an advanced torque vectoring controller, and a genetic fuzzy active steering controller have been developed previously. This paper investigates whether the integration of these stability control systems enhances {{the performance of the}} vehicle in terms of handling, stability, path-following, and longitudinal dynamics.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of electronic control units (ECUs) are nowadays networked in automotive vehicles to help achieve advanced vehicle control and eliminate bulky electrical wiring. This, however, inevitably leads to increased complexity in vehicle fault diagnostics. Traditional off-board fault diagnostics and repair at service centres, by using only diagnostic trouble codes logged by conventional onboard diagnostics, can become unwieldy especially when dealing with intermittent faults in complex networked electronic systems. This can result in inaccurate and time consuming diagnostics {{due to lack of}} real-time fault information of the interaction among ECUs in the network-wide perspective. This thesis proposes a new framework for on-board knowledge-based diagnostics focusing on network level faults, and presents an implementation of a real-time in-vehicle network diagnostic system, using case-based reasoning. A newly developed fault detection technique and the results from several practical experiments with the diagnostic system using a network simulation tool, <b>a</b> <b>hardware-</b> in-the- loop simulator, a disturbance simulator, simulated ECUs and real ECUs networked on a test rig are also presented. The results show that the new vehicle diagnostics scheme, based on the proposed new framework, can provide more real-time network level diagnostic data, and more detailed and self-explanatory diagnostic outcomes. This new system can provide increased diagnostic capability when compared with conventional diagnostic methods in terms of detecting message communication faults. In particular, the underlying incipient network problems that are ignored by the conventional on-board diagnostics are picked up for thorough fault diagnostics and prognostics which can be carried out by a whole-vehicle fault management system, contributing to the further development of intelligent and fault-tolerant vehicles...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{software}} system architecture {{for the implementation}} of hard real-time applications. The core of the system is a microkernel whose reactivity (interrupt handling as in synchronous reactive programs) and proactivity (task scheduling as in traditional RTOSs) are fully programmable. The microkernel, which we implemented on a Strong-ARM processor, consists of two interacting domain-specific virtual machines, a reactive E (Embedded) machine and a proactive S (Scheduling) machine. The microkernel code (or microcode) that runs on the microkernel is partitioned into E and S code. E code manages the interaction of the system with the physical environment: the execution of E code is triggered by environment interrupts, which signal external events such as the arrival of a message or sensor value, and it releases application tasks to the S machine. S code manages the interaction of the system with the processor: the execution of S code is triggered by hardware interrupts, which signal internal events such as the completion of a task or time slice, and it dispatches application tasks to the CPU, possibly preempting a running task. This partition of the system orthogonalizes the two main concerns of real-time implementations: E code refers to environment time and thus defines the reactivity of the system in <b>a</b> <b>hardware-</b> and scheduler-independent fashion; S code refers to CPU time and defines a system scheduler. If both time lines can be reconciled, then the code is called time safe; violations of time safety are handled again in a programmable way, by run-time exceptions. The separation of E from S code permits the independent programming, verification, optimization, composition, dynamic adaptation, and reuse of both reaction and scheduling mechanisms. Our measurements show that the system overhead is very acceptable even for large sets of task, generally in the 0. 2 – 0. 3 % range...|$|E
40|$|Future {{particle}} physics experiments are searching {{more and more}} for rare decays which have similar signatures in the detector as the huge background. For those events usually simple selection criteria do not exist, which {{makes it impossible to}} implement <b>a</b> <b>hardware-</b> trigger based on a small subset of detector data. Therefore, all the detector data is read out continuously and processed on-the-fly to achieve a data reduction suitable for permanent storage and detailed analysis. To cope with these requirements of a triggerless readout, also the simulation software has to be adopted to add a continuous data production with pile-up effects and event overlapping in addition to the event-wise simulation. This simulated data is of utmost importance to get a realistic detector simulation, to develop event-building algorithms and to determine the hardware requirements for the DAQ system of the experiments. The possibility to simulate a continuous data stream was integrated into the FairRoot simulation framework. This running mode is called time-based simulation and a lot of effort was taken that one can switch seamlessly between the event-based and the time-based simulation mode. One experiment, which is using this new feature, is the PANDA experiment. It utilizes a quasicontinuous antiproton beam with a mean time between interactions of 50 ns. Because of the unbunched structure of the beam the interaction time follows a Poisson statistic with a high probability of events with short time distances. Depending on the time resolution of the subdetectors this leads to an overlap of up to 20 events inside a sub-detector. This makes it an ideal test candidate for the time-based simulation. In the following text an overview of the implementation of the time-based simulation mode in FairRoot is given and some examples for the P̅ANDA experiment are shown...|$|E

A two-passenger all-wheel drive urban electric vehicle (AUTO 21 EV) with four direct-drive in-wheel motors and an active steering system has been designed and developed at the University of Waterloo. A novel fuzzy slip control system is developed for this vehicle using the advantage of four in-wheel motors. A conventional slip control system uses the hydraulic brake system {{in order to control}} the tire slip ratio, which is the difference between the wheel center velocity and the velocity of the tire contact patch along the wheel plane, thereby influencing the longitudinal dynamics of a vehicle. The advantage of the proposed fuzzy slip controller is that it acts as an ABS system by preventing the tires from locking up when braking, as a TCS by preventing the tires from spinning out when accelerating. More importantly, the proposed slip controller is also capable of replacing the entire hydraulic brake system of the vehicle by automatically distributing the braking force between the wheels using the available braking torque of the in-wheel motors. In this regard, the proposed fuzzy slip controller guarantees the highest traction or braking force on each wheel on every road condition by individually controlling the slip ratio of each tire with a much faster response time. The performance of the proposed fuzzy slip controller is confirmed by driving the AUTO 21 EV through several test maneuvers using a driver model in the simulation environment.

This note analyses the Precise Time Data Out messages, that have recently been collected in the course of <b>a</b> <b>hardware-</b> in-the-loop simulation. To this end the messages have been decoded and the time difference of GPS and UTC time as well as the Time Figure of Merit (TFOM) has been computed and analyzed. To relate these numbers with the number of tracked satellites and the receiver acquisition performance, the Time Mark Out Message (ID 3) has also been decoded. The following results were obtained: 1. The Precise Time Data Out message and the 1 Pulse- Per-Second (1 PPS) are transmitted by the GEM-S only after the receiver has undergone a certain startup phase. 2. The Precise Time Data Out message contains valid date and time data only when the Time Figure of Merit (TFOM) is 8 or less. 3. The time difference of GPS and UTC time can be derived from the Precise Time Data Out message or the Time Mark Out message. 4. Valid UTC times are expected at about 2 minutes after the initalization of the receiver. 5. The current year is not given in the Precise Time Data Out message. It has thus to be provided either by the Time Mark Out message or by external sources. Althougt the great majority of tests for a steering of the BIRD onboard clock still have to be done, this note provides a first step towards a time synchronization concept...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the development of a framework for the automatic generation of systems of kinematic and dynamic equations that are suitable for real-time applications. In particular, the efficient simulation of constrained multibody systems is addressed. When modelled with ideal joints, many mechanical systems of practical interest contain closed kinematic chains, or kinematic loops, and are most conveniently modelled using a set of generalized coordinates of cardinality exceeding the degrees-of-freedom of the system. Dependent generalized coordinates add nonlinear algebraic constraint equations to the ordinary differential equations of motion, thereby producing a set of differential-algebraic equations that may be difficult to solve in an efficient yet precise manner. Several methods have been proposed for simulating such systems in real time, including index reduction, model simplification, and constraint stabilization techniques. In this work, the equations of motion are formulated symbolically using linear graph theory. The embedding technique is applied to eliminate the Lagrange multipliers from the dynamic equations and obtain one ordinary differential equation for each independent acceleration. The theory of Gröbner bases is then used to triangularize the kinematic constraint equations, thereby producing recursively solvable systems for calculating the dependent generalized coordinates given values of the independent coordinates. For systems that can be fully triangularized, the kinematic constraints are always satisfied exactly and in a fixed amount of time. Where full triangularization is not possible, a block-triangular form can be obtained that still results in more efficient simulations than existing iterative and constraint stabilization techniques. The proposed approach is applied to the kinematic and dynamic simulation of several mechanical systems, including six-bar mechanisms, parallel robots, and two vehicle suspensions: a five-link and a double-wishbone. The efficient kinematic solution generated for the latter is used in the real-time simulation of a vehicle with double-wishbone suspensions on both axles, which is implemented in <b>a</b> <b>hardware-</b> and operator-in-the-loop driving simulator. The Gröbner basis approach is particularly suitable for situations requiring very efficient simulations of multibody systems whose parameters are constant, such as the plant models in model-predictive control strategies and the vehicle models in driving simulators...|$|E
