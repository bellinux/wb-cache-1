He began writing {{what would become}} The Red Badge of Courage in June 1893, while living with his older brother Edmund in Lake View, New Jersey. Crane conceived the story {{from the point of}} view of a young private who is at first filled with boyish dreams of the glory of war, only to become disillusioned by war's reality. He took the private's surname, [...] "Fleming," [...] from his sister-in-law's maiden name. He would later relate that the first paragraphs came to him with [...] "every word in place, every comma, every period fixed." [...] Working mostly nights, he wrote from around midnight until four or five in the morning. Because he could not afford a typewriter, he carefully wrote in ink on legal-sized paper, occasionally crossing through or overlying a word. If he changed something, he would rewrite the whole page. He later moved to New York City, where he completed the novel in April 1894.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} Whitney was {{guaranteed}} {{to appear in}} seven of the first 13 episodes, and contracted for four days work on each. However, she was used for nine additional days, leading D'Agosta to suggest to Roddenberry that if guest stars instead played the similar role but with different characters then they [...] "would cost less and hold as much value". He added that they should instead look to using Whitney on <b>a</b> <b>free-lance</b> basis instead of under permanent contract. By September 8, 1966, Whitney's agent had been informed that her contract had been terminated, which was around a week prior to the shoot of her final episode, [...] "The Conscience of the King". Roddenberry told Whitney that he didn't want to lose Rand as he wanted her relationship with Kirk to continue. In a memo to Gene Coon on October 27, 1966, Roddenberry suggested bringing Whitney back as Rand, albeit with a different hairstyle {{similar to the way}} she wore it in Police Story as this [...] "made her look much younger and softer", but she was never invited back to the series.|$|E

In August 1991, Casolaro was found dead in a hotel room where he was staying.

And in a newspaper account of his 1883 sermon in Alexandria, Virginia, Ryan was quoted as having mentioned his ministry to Louisiana soldiers during the war.
