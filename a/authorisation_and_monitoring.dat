40|$|This {{document}} {{provides a}} list of the most significant risks related to the AEO <b>authorisation</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> process, and at the same time, it provides {{a list of}} possible solutions on how to keep these risks under control. Possible solutions proposed for one indicator can be applicable to more than one risk area identified. The suggested list is neither exhaustive nor definitive. The self-assessment questionnaire is completed by the economic operators {{at the very beginning of}} the application process and aims to give a state of play of their business and procedures and their relevance for the AEO authorisation. The ‘Threats, risks and possible solution ’ document is addressed both to customs authorities and economic operators to facilitate the audit and examination to ensure compliance with AEO criteria by matching the information provided in the SAQ and the risk areas identified and possible solutions to cover them...|$|E
40|$|The {{past four}} years have seen events with {{considerable}} implications for the Board. The volume of work has continued {{to grow in the}} established areas of <b>authorisation</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> of human and veterinary medicines, licensing and monitoring of manufacturing facilities and in the area of clinical trials. In addition however. the Board's responsibilities in relation to European product harmonisation have greatly increased. Restriction on the Board's ability to increase its staff complement means that overall staff numbers are practically unchanged from those contained in our 1991 report. Since European matters have required a progressive increase in the proportion of staff time devoted to this area, there has been a corresponding and unfortunate reduction in staff resources available for purely national activities. The retirement in 1992 of Dr. Allene Scott, Medical Director of the National Drugs Advisory Board since its establishment in 1966, was a major landmark and removed a person who worked almost constantly at the Board's activities over that period. It is with regret that I also have to note her untimely death shortly after retirement. The establishment of a central agency for Europe, the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, is a major step towards harmonisation of medicinal products throughout the European Union. The progressive moves towards mutual recognition, resulting in proposed full recognition in 1998 have important implications for the availability of medicines throughout Europe and will {{have a major impact on}} regulatory processes...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a decision cache for the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) that supports fine-grained <b>authorisation</b> <b>and</b> anonymisation of XML based messages and documents down to XML attribute and element level. The decision cache is implemented as an XACML obligation service, where a specification of the XML elements to be authorised and anonymised {{is sent to}} the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) during initial authorisation. Further authorisation of individual XML elements according to the authorisation specification is then performed on all matching XML resources, and decisions are stored in the decision cache. This makes it possible to cache fine-grained XACML <b>authorisation</b> <b>and</b> anonymisation decisions, which reduces the authorisation load on the Policy Decision Point (PDP). The theoretical solution is related to a practical case study consisting of a privacy-enhanced intrusion detection system that needs to perform anonymisation of Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (IDMEF) XML messages before they are sent to a security operations centre that operates in privacy-preserving mode. The solution increases the scalability of XACML based <b>authorisation</b> significantly, <b>and</b> may be instrumental in implementing federated <b>authorisation</b> <b>and</b> anonymisation based on XACML in several areas, including intrusion detection systems, web services, content management systems and GRID based authentication <b>and</b> <b>authorisation...</b>|$|R
