5|$|Juveniles {{begin to}} court <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>age,</b> {{but may not}} bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key {{behaviors}} of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} {{their use in}} sexual display was first {{proposed}} by Davitashvili in 1961 and has gained increasing acceptance since. Evidence that visual display was important, either in courtship or in other social behavior, {{can be seen in}} the fact that horned dinosaurs differ markedly in their adornments, making each species highly distinctive. Also, modern living creatures with such displays of horns and adornments use them in similar behavior. A 2006 study of the smallest Triceratops skull, ascertained to be a juvenile, shows the frill and horns developed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>age,</b> predating sexual development and thus probably important for visual communication and species recognition in general. The use of the exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists for structures in modern species.|$|E

25|$|Progeria is an {{extremely}} rare genetic disorder in which symptoms resembling aspects of aging are manifested <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>age.</b> Progeria {{is one of several}} progeroid syndromes. Those born with progeria typically live to their mid-teens to early twenties. It is a genetic condition that occurs as a new mutation, and is rarely inherited, as carriers usually do not live to reproduce. Although the term progeria applies strictly speaking to all diseases characterized by premature aging symptoms, and is often used as such, it is often applied specifically in reference to Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS).|$|E
25|$|Children {{who were}} born before the family immigrated to the United States may have more {{difficulty}} succeeding academically than children {{who were born}} after the move to the United States, or who were very young {{at the time of}} immigration.

Other research confirms the fact that second generation groups tend to have higher levels of academic achievement than first generation groups.|$|E
