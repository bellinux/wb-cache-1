50|$|Competitive {{interactions}} between <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> and domestic livestock for preferred forage species are unclear. Several studies suggest <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> avoid eating many plants that livestock prefer, and prefer many plants livestock avoid. Conversely, on shortgrass prairie in Colorado, cattle and <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> had a 64% similarity in annual diets.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> {{have been}} called [...] "ecosystem engineers" [...] due to their {{influence}} on the biotic and abiotic characteristics of their habitat, landscape architecture, and ecosystem structure and function. [...] Research suggests <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> are a keystone species in some, but not all, geographic areas. <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> enhance the diversity of vegetation, vertebrates, and invertebrates through their foraging and burrowing activities and by their presence as prey items. Grasslands inhabited by <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> support higher biodiversity than grasslands not occupied by them.|$|R
40|$|<b>Black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies {{can become}} overcrowded, and the colonies, landscape, and people {{affected}} by them {{may benefit from}} controlled populations. Contraception is a method that may be useful, particularly where lethal control is inappropriate or illegal. We investigated if oral administration of 20, 25 -diazacholesterol (DiazaCon®), an inhibitor of cholesterol and reproductive steroid hormone production, could reduce reproductive success of treated <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> in a fi eld trial. Ten treatments of approximately 45 -mg DiazaCon per <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> yielded a 47 % reduction of young:adult ratios compared to control sites. Over a 3 -month period, desmosterol, a cholesterol precursor used {{as an indicator of}} DiazaCon effects, was not detectable in any <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> trapped at control sites, whereas elevated levels were detectable in 33 of 35 blood samples from <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> trapped at treated sites. Average cholesterol levels were lower in treated animals than in control animals.

50|$|Sylvatic plague, {{caused by}} the {{bacterium}} Yersinia pestis, can quickly eliminate entire <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies. Once infected, death occurs within a few days. <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> are also susceptible to diseases transmitted by introduced animals.|$|R
50|$|Some {{changes in}} plant {{composition}} {{brought about by}} <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> may benefit livestock by encouraging an increase in plants more tolerant of grazing, such as needleleaf sedge (Carex duriuscula), sixweeks grass (Vulpia octoflora), and scarlet globemallow. Grazing by <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> may also improve the nutritional qualities of some plants. On a shortgrass prairie near Fort Collins, Colorado, plant species diversity was greater inside <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies than outside of colonies, and perennial grasses such as buffalo grass and forbs increased. While <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies at Wind Cave National Park typically had lower levels of plant biomass and were dominated by forbs, plants growing on <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies had higher leaf nitrogen concentrations than plants in mixed-grass prairie outside colonies. Foraging by <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> does not significantly affect steer weights. While forage availability and use by cattle decreased in <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> foraging areas, steer weight was not reduced significantly in either of two years of study at the USDA's Southern Great Plains Experimental Range near Woodward, Oklahoma. Nutrient cycling, increased soil fertility, and subsequent changes in forage quality partly compensated for reduced forage availability.|$|R
5000|$|Hundreds {{of species}} of {{vertebrates}} [...] and invertebrates {{are associated with}} <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies. Vertebrate species richness on their colonies increases with colony size and density. West of the Missouri River in Montana, 40% (100 species) of all vertebrate fauna in prairie habitats rely on <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies for food, nesting, and/or denning. Rare and declining species, such as the black-footed ferret, swift fox (Vulpes velox), mountain plover (Charadrius montanus), and burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) are associated with colonies. Because their foraging activities keep plant development in a suppressed vegetative state with higher nutritional qualities, herbivores, including red deer (Cervus elaphus), American bison, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), and domestic cattle often prefer foraging in <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies. Animals that depend on herbaceous cover in sagebrush habitat, such as mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and sage grouse (Centrocercus spp.), may be deterred by the decreased vegetative cover on <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies.

50|$|<b>Black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> are {{frequently}} exterminated from ranchland, being viewed as pests.

In 2006, all eight appearances of plague in <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> colonies resulted in total colony loss. Studies in 1961 estimated only 364000 acre of occupied <b>black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> habitat in the United States. A second study in 2000 showed 676000 acre. However, a comprehensive study between 10 states and various tribes in 2004 estimated 1842000 acre in the United States, plus an additional 51589 acre in Mexico and Canada.

5000|$|<b>Black-tailed</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> are {{selective}} opportunists, preferring certain phenological stages or {{types of}} vegetation {{according to their}} needs. When forage is stressed by grazing, drought, or herbicides, they change their diets quickly. Grasses are preferred over forbs, and may comprise more than 75% of their diets, especially during summer. Western wheatgrass, buffalo grass, blue grama [...] and sedges (Carex spp.) are preferred during spring and summer. Scarlet globemallow (Sphaeralcea coccinea) [...] and Russian thistle (Salsola kali) [...] are preferred during late summer and fall, but are sought out during every season. During winter, plains prickly pear (Opuntia polyacantha), Russian thistle, and underground roots are preferred. Shrubs such as rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus spp.), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), saltbush (Atriplex spp.), and sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) are also commonly eaten. Water, which is generally not available on the short-grass prairie, is obtained from vegetation such as plains prickly pear.
