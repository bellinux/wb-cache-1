5|$|Nigeria regained {{democracy}} in 1999 when it elected Olusegun Obasanjo, the former military head of state, {{as the new}} President of Nigeria. This ended almost 33 years of military rule (from 1966 until 1999), excluding the short-lived second republic (between 1979 and 1983) by military dictators who seized power in coups d'état and counter-coups during the Nigerian military juntas of 1966–1979 and 1983–1998. Although the elections that brought Obasanjo to power in 1999 and again in 2003 were condemned as unfree <b>and</b> <b>unfair,</b> Nigeria has shown marked improvements in attempts to tackle government corruption and to hasten development.|$|E

Their 10-year friendship with Octave Chanute, already strained by tension over how much credit, if any, he might deserve for their success, collapsed after he publicly criticized their actions.|$|E
