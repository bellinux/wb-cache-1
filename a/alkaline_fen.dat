On impermeable acid rocks such as metamorphic schists in a high rainfall climate like that of Western Scotland, the catena consists of thick acidic peat forming wet bog on the flatter facets, and thinner, drier, somewhat less acidic peaty podsols on the steeper facets. Thus the soil depth, acidity (pH) and soil moisture vary continuously along the slope. On a permeable basic rock such as chalk, the catena may consist of thick brown earths on the flatter facets, with thin rendzinas on the steeper slopes, while the valley bottom may include <b>alkaline</b> <b>fen</b> peat or river alluvium.|$|E

40|$|Although in Europe {{atmospheric}} deposition of sulphur has decreased considerably {{over the last}} decades, groundwater pollution by sulphate may still continue due to pyrite oxidation in the soil {{as a result of}} excessive fertilisation. Inflowing groundwater rich in sulphate can change biogeochemical cycling in nutrient-poor wetland ecosystems. Incoming sulphate loads may induce internal eutrophication as well as the accumulation of dissolved sulphide, which is phytotoxic. We, however, argue that upwelling sulphate rich groundwater may also promote the conservation of rare and threatened alkaline fens, since excessive fertilisation and pyrite oxidation also produces acidity, which invokes calcite dissolution, and increased alkalinity and hardness (Ca 2 + + Mg 2 +) of the inflowing groundwater. Our observations in a very species-rich wetland nature reserve show that sulphate is reduced and effectively precipitates as iron sulphides when this calcareous and sulphate rich groundwater flows upward through the organic soil of the investigated nature reserve. Furthermore, we show that sulphate reduction coincides with an increase in alkalinity production, which in our case results in active calcite precipitation in the soil. In spite of the occurring sulphate reduction we found no evidence for internal eutrophication. Extremely low phosphorous concentration in the pore water could be attributed to a high C:P ratio of soil organic matter and co-precipitation with calcite. Our study shows that seepage dependent <b>alkaline</b> <b>fen</b> ecosystems can be remarkably resilient to fertilisation and pyrite oxidation induced groundwater quality changes...|$|E
40|$|The cell density, activity, and {{community}} {{structure of the}} bacterial community in wetland sediments were monitored over a 13 -month period. The study was performed at Cedar Bog, an <b>alkaline</b> <b>fen.</b> The objective was to characterize {{the relationship between the}} sediment bacterial community in groundwater upwelling zones and the physical and chemical factors which might influence the community structure and activity. DNA, protein, and lipid synthesis were measured at three different upwelling zones by using [3 H]thymidine, [14 C]leucine, and [14 C]glucose incorporation, respectively. The physiological status (apparent stress) of the consortium was assessed by comparing [14 C]glucose incorporation into membrane and that into storage lipids. Bacterial cell density was determined by acridine orange direct counts, and gross bacterial community structure was determined by bisbenzimidazole-cesium chloride gradient analysis of total bacterial community DNA. Both seasonal and site-related covariation were observed in all estimates of bacterial biomass and activity. Growth rate estimates and cell density peaked in late July at 2. 5 x 10 (8) cells/g/day and 2. 7 x 10 (9) cells/g, respectively, and decreased in December to 2. 0 x 10 (7) cells/g/day and 1. 5 x 10 (9) cells/g, respectively. Across sites, membrane-to-storage-lipid ratios were generally highest in late spring and peaked in September for one site. Overall, the data indicate dynamic seasonal differences in sediment bacterial community activity and physiology, possibly in response to changing physical and chemical environmental factors which included the C/N/P ratios of the perfusing groundwater. By contrast, total cell numbers were rather constant, {{and community}} structure analysis indicated that the overall community structure was similar throughout the study...|$|E
40|$|Fen-bog {{succession}} {{is accompanied}} by strong increases of carbon accumulation rates. We tested the prevailing hypothesis that living Sphagna have extraordinarily high cation exchange capacity (CEC) and therefore acidify their environment by exchanging tissue-bound protons for basic cations in soil water. As Sphagnum invasion in a peatland usually coincides with succession from a brown moss-dominated <b>alkaline</b> <b>fen</b> to an acidic bog, the CEC of Sphagna is widely believed {{to play an important}} role in this acidification process. However, Sphagnum CEC has never been compared explicitly to that of a wide range of other bryophyte taxa. Whether high CEC directly leads to the ability to acidify the environment in situ also remains to be tested. We screened 20 predominant subarctic bryophyte species, including fen brown mosses and bog Sphagna for CEC, in situ soil water acidification capacity (AC), and peat acid neutralizing capacity (ANC). All these bryophyte species possessed substantial CEC, which was remarkably similar for brown mosses and Sphagna. This refutes the commonly accepted idea of living Sphagnum CEC being responsible for peatland acidification, as Sphagnum's ecological predecessors, brown mosses, can do the same job. Sphagnum AC was several times higher than that of other bryophytes, suggesting that CE (cation exchange) sites of Sphagna in situ are not saturated with basic cations, probably due to the virtual absence of these cations in the bog water. Together, these results suggest that Sphagna can not realize their CEC in bogs, while fen mosses can do so in fens. The fen peat ANC was 65 % higher than bog ANC, indicating that acidity released by brown mosses in the CE process was neutralized, maintaining an alkaline environment. We propose two successional pathways indicating boundaries for a fen-bog shift with respect to bryophyte CEC. In neither of them is Sphagnum CE an important factor. We conclude that living Sphagnum CEC does not play any considerable role in the fen-bog shift. Alternatively, we propose that exclusively indirect effects of Sphagnum expansion such as peat accumulation and subsequent blocking of upward alkaline soil water transport are keys to the fen-bog succession and therefore for bog-associated carbon accumulation. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America...|$|E

Imagine this land before the time of European settlement: Mangroves skirted our coasts to the south. Salt marshes fringed much of the remaining seashore. Prairies that reached from the Great Lakes to the Rockies were magnificently speckled with the green and blue of wet meadows and prairie potholes. Giant old-growth cypress trees covered with Spanish. "moss" grew in the tea-colored water of the southern deepwater swamps, from the Gulf of Mexico up the Mississippi to Illinois and up the Atlantic shore to New Jersey. Water pulsed seasonally into the vast floodplains of the East and Midwest, creating vast bottomland hardwood forests. Even the rare floodplains of the West, like the Great Basin and California's Central Valley, supported ancient wetlands. Riparian wetlands snaked along every stream and river in the land, providing oases of habitat, even in the arid and semi-arid West.

40|$|Hine's Emerald Dragonfly is {{a member}} of the family Corduliidae, the {{emeralds}} and baskettails. This species was first described by E. B. Williamson from a site in northern Ohio in 1931. Subsequently, the species was virtually unknown to most people and few specialists. It was not until the 1990 s that attention was given to refinding this species and associating it with the proper habitats. As a result of prelimi-nary surveys, in 1995 it was given protection under the Endangered Species Act, and is now on the Federal Endangered Species List. This listing spurred an effort to document the existing sites for Somatochlora hineana and to search for new populations. As a result of the efforts by a few Odonata researchers, we now have a much better idea of the range and biology of Hine's Emerald. This note presents a summary of its biology and distribution with aids to identification. BIOLOGY & HABITAT Somatochlora hineana is a species restricted to calcareous areas where limestone lies close to, or at the surface, often overlain by a sandy or marly soil type. Larvae (= nymphs) are found in cool, shallow slowly-moving waters, which consist of spring-fed marshes, <b>alkaline</b> <b>fens</b> (= seepage sedge meadows), mineral-rich fens with shallow creeks, springs, small pools, and marl deposits and calcareous marshy streams. Many of these areas have small channels where the water moves very slowly through cattails and sedges. Recent work has shown that larvae often spend considerable periods of time within crayfish burrows (Cambarus diogenes) during the day, and these same burrows provide refuge for larvae during droughts. Once the adults emerge, they may be found within a kilometer of the breeding sites. Males establish small breeding territories which they defend against other males and sometimes even other species of dragonflies. They typicall...|$|R

40|$|Manmade {{changes of}} landscapes {{and the loss}} of {{biodiversity}} through an on-going intensification of agricultural land use demand for the monitoring of natural habitats, vegetation types and their changes. EU Policies like the Flora-Fauna-Habitat (FFH) directive or the High Nature Value (HNV) farmland (EU rural policy framework) request the observation and conservation of natural vegetation with a reporting duty on the conservation status of these areas every six and four years. The FFH directive includes natural and semi-natural vegetation identified as Natura 2000 conservation areas and the HNV farmlands are areas in which the major land use is agriculture but also include a high species and habitat diversity or species of European conservation concern. In the context of this major demand of reporting, remote sensing has great advantages as basis for monitoring of vegetation types and habitats, as it is able to provide large-scale up-to-date geo-information for these monitoring and management activities. However, the monitoring of vegetation demands for data acquisitions at specific times during the growing season. SAR-based systems have the great advantage of acquiring data of the Earth surface within these crucial time frames weather and daytime independent. TerraSAR-X (TS-X) has the potential to acquire images with a high spatial resolution of less than 10 m {{and at the same time}} a high temporal resolution of 11 days repetition rate. In addition, textural information and the potential to analyse dielectric characteristics (e. g. moisture) enable the differentiation of various vegetation types and the deduction of biophysical characteristics. Within the project MSAVE, the applicability of temporally and geometrically high resolution data of optical, SAR and hyperspectral sensors for the monitoring of vegetation is evaluated and new methods for the analysis of multi-seasonal remote sensing data are developed, which are suited for the identification and quantification of habitats. The herein presented work as part of the project centres the evaluation of the differentiability of NATURA 2000 habitats and HNV grassland with TS-X time series data. Thereby, a TS-X time series consisting of 11 dual-pol (VV/VH) acquisitions in 2011 for the test area located in Southern Bavaria as well as reference data collected during several field surveys within the SAR data collection period are used for the classification of different grassland types, which include the FFH habitat types 6410 (Molinia meadows), 7120 (Degraded raised bogs still capable of natural regeneration), 7140 (Transition mires and quaking bogs) and 7230 (<b>Alkaline</b> <b>fens),</b> as well as HNV grassland. Up-to-now, the TS-X time series has been pre-processed including multi-temporal filtering and the Kennaugh decomposition developed by Schmitt, A. (2012) has been applied to the data. Furthermore, texture features were derived. After a separability analysis for defining the best suitable features for discriminating the different grassland types, the classification is performed with the Maximum-Entropy algorithm. First results show that the high temporal and geometric resolution time series of TS-X allows for a detailed analysis on the usability of polarimetric SAR data for the classification of different vegetation types. The distribution of FFH habitats and HNV grassland can be modelled by means of Kennaugh elements of cross-polar TS-X time series data. The discrimination of the different grassland types is further improved including texture features in the classification...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between fen vegetation {{and water and}} soil chemistry gradients in an <b>alkaline</b> slope <b>fen</b> was studied {{during the growing season}} of 2005. Owned by Irving Materials Inc. (IMI), the fen is a two hectare property in north-central Henry County, Indiana. The objectives of the study were (1) to conduct a floral inventory of the site and determine the floristic quality index for the site; (2) to visually characterize and stratify the site into areas of similar vegetation or community types; (3) to characterize relationships, if any, existing between vegetation and chemical and hydrological gradients; and (4) to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of ground water alkalinity throughout the fen. The floral inventory revealed 287 species, representing 180 genera in 79 families. Of the documented flora, 246 are native, 41 are adventives, and 20 represent Henry County records. The Floristic Quality Index and the mean Coefficient of Conservatism suggest that the site is of nature preserve quality and contains noteworthy remnants of the region’s natural heritage. They also suggest that the adventives are having a minimal negative impact on the native flora. For quantitative vegetation analysis, fixed transects were monitored three times during the growing season (spring, summer, fall). Basic subsurface water chemistry and levels were monitored bi-weekly and 30 soil and 30 surface water samples (10 each to coordinate with the vegetation survey) were analyzed for over 35 physical parameters. In all cases, the parameters fell within the ranges of typical Midwestern fens, but most noticeably for calcium carbonate. Applying the Floristic Quality Assessment to the vegetation occurring along fixed transects, 26 species were identified with an importance value greater than one.
