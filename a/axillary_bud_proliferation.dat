40|$|Eucalyptus globulus Labill. {{has been}} used in Spain for decades as a {{cellulose}} source for the paper and textile industry. Since 1997, Sniace group has tested new provenances and families from 29 different Eucalyptus species to explore their capacity for biomass and bioenergy production. Plus trees for growth, wood quality, rooting capacity and tolerance to Mycosphaerella sp have been identified by mass selection, and more than 300 controlled crosses among those trees have been carried out. However, the restrictions caused by the high susceptibility to Mycosphaerella leaf disease and the low rooting capacity of the species Eucalyptus globulus Labill. delay the application of the gains to a commercial scale. The objective of this project is to improve the production of Eucalyptus in the North of Spain focused on the improvement of two traits of economic importance: clonal/rooting capacity and tolerance to Mycosphaerella sp. To achieve this goal three partial objectives have been approached: Mass propagation of selected adult clones and rooting improvement by in vitro tissue culture Clonal propagation by sequential subcultures of <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> in <b>proliferation</b> and elongation media and further rooting of elongated shoots will be developed. This will further optimize a simple in vitro protocol for the micropropagation of identified elite mature trees for raising plantations.

Consequently, many efforts have been deployed to develop conservation methods.

Indeed, meristems are more resistant to genetic changes than disorganized tissues. The present review explored through the scientific literature the <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> <b>proliferation</b> approach and the possible somaclonal variation that could arise from it. Almost genetic stability or low level of genetic variation is often reported. On the contrary, in a few cases studied to date, DNA methylation alterations often appeared in the progenies, showing epigenetic variations in the regenerated plants from axillary bud culture. Fortunately, epigenetic changes are often temporary and plants may revert to the normal phenotype. Thus, in the absence of genetic variations and the existence of reverting epigenetic changes over time, axillary bud culture can be adopted as an alternative nonconventional way of conserving and restoring of plant biodiversity...|$|E

40|$|<b>Axillary</b> <b>bud</b> {{outgrowth}} {{is regulated}} by both environmental cues and internal plant hormone signaling.

Auxins are transported basipetally and inhibit the <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> outgrowth indirectly by either restricting auxin export from the <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> to the stem (canalization model) or inducing strigolactone biosynthesis and limiting cytokinin levels (second messenger model). Both models have supporting evidence and are not mutually exclusive. In this study, we used a modified split-plate bioassay to apply different plant growth regulators to isolated stem segments of chrysanthemum and measure their effect on <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> growth. Results showed <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> outgrowth in the bioassay within 5 days after nodal stem excision. Treatments with apical auxin (IAA) inhibited bud outgrowth which was counteracted by treatments with basal cytokinins (TDZ, zeatin, 2 -ip). Treatments with basal strigolactone (GR 24) could inhibit <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> growth without an apical auxin treatment. GR 24 inhibition of <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> could be counteracted with auxin transport inhibitors (TIBA and NPA). Treatments with sucrose in the medium resulted in stronger <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> growth, which could be inhibited with apical auxin treatment but not with basal strigolactone treatment. These observations provide support for both the canalization model and the second messenger model with, on the one hand, the influence of auxin transport on strigolactone inhibition of <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> and, on the other hand, the inhibition of <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> growth by strigolactone without an apical auxin source.

This involved comparing the observations with the theoretical possibilities which existed. A loose classification of the patterns was then constructed using the theoretical possibilities as a basis.

This analysis pointed towards the existence, in a large number of species, of a correlation between growth in an <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> and growth in surrounding tissues, particularly the expanding subtending leaf. One species - Salix fragilis - was chosen as the subject for a particularly detailed analysis.

The in vitro propagation of Fragaria species using <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> <b>proliferation,</b> adventitious shoot regeneration and somatic embryogenesis has been investigated in a number of previous studies. The morphogenesis seems to be highly dependent on plant growth regulators and media used for culture, which is again genotype specific. In strawberry, genetic transformation has been developed using tissue culture systems with varying rates of success. This review presents the progress in-depth of various aspects of strawberry culture in vitro, on gelled and in liquid media using bioreactors, for its improvement and for commercial production. It also discusses the issues that still need to be addressed to utilize the full potential of plant tissue culture techniques in mass propagation, in vitro selection, somaclonal variation, haploid recovery, somatic hybridization, genetic transformation and in cryopreservation of strawberries. Application of mole-cular marker techniques should be useful to verify the clonal fidelity of micropropagated strawberries. Strawberry improvement using i...|$|E
40|$|Quercus robur L. was micropropagated by <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> <b>proliferation</b> testing two {{different}} shoot culture systems: (i) on gelled medium in Microbox (plastic vessel with a strip for ventilation) and (ii) in liquid culture in PlantformTM bioreactor (a temporary immersion system). Two different conditions of temporary immersion were assessed: 12  min/ 8  h (Plantform 1) and 8  min/ 16  h (Plantform 2). The {{effect of the}} two culture systems was evaluated also during subsequent rooting phase, carried out on gelled medium. Finally, {{the influence of the}} different culture conditions on leaf structure was considered, taking also into consideration the micromorphological characters of young leaves from in-field-grown oaks. Nodal segments, excised from established in vitro shoots and cultured on modified Woody Plant Medium, showed a higher Relative Growth Rate in Plantform than in Microbox, but culture conditions provided in Plantform 1 favored shoot and leaf hyperhydricity. Shoots cultured in Microbox or Plantform 2 presented the same percentage of rooting after their transfer on gelled rooting medium. Leaves developed in the {{two different}} microenvironments had large stomata with elliptical shape, which indicates good functionality, and formed hairs, and epicuticolar waxes. These leaf features are considered to provide a good adaptability to ex vitro conditions...|$|E
40|$|Background: Elephant tusk cactus Coryphantha elephantidens (Lem.) Lem. is an {{important}} attractive ornamental cactus. The plant produces offshoots from tubercles very rarely, and the seedlings exhibit slow growth and susceptibility to damping off. Slow growth and high demand in the cactus industry lead to finding an alternate fast propagation method. Results: An innovative in vitro technique based on <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> <b>proliferation</b> has been developed for an ornamental cactus C. elephantidens (Lem.) Lem. Four different explant types formed multiple shoots on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. Of the two cytokinins, 6 -Benzylaminopurine (BAP) and Kinetin (KN), BAP {{proved to be more}} effective for multiple shoot induction and shoot growth from different explant types. Longitudinally cut stem explants, when cultured on MS medium supplemented with 6. 6  μM BAP give maximum axillary shoot proliferation (12. 4 shoots). Type of explant significantly influenced the micropropagation rate. Type of carbon source used in the medium imparted a profound effect on shoot growth and dry weight. The maximum dry weight gain of the shoot was observed with 9 % sucrose. Conclusion: Development of an efficient micropropagation protocol which can be used to produce more than 10, 000 rooted plantlets in 150  days from a single longitudinally divided shoot explant...|$|E
40|$|When {{the upper}} part of the main shoot of the Japanese morning glory (Pharbitis nil or Ipomoea nil) is bent down, the <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> {{situated}} on the uppermost node of the bending region is released from apical dominance and elongates. Here, we demonstrate that this release of <b>axillary</b> <b>buds</b> from apical dominance is gravity regulated. We utilized two agravitropic mutants of morning glory defective in gravisensing cell differ-entiation, weeping (we) and weeping 2 (we 2). Bending the main shoots of eitherwe orwe 2 plants resulted in minimal elongation of their <b>axillary</b> <b>buds.</b> This aberration was genetically linked to the agravitropism phenotype of the mutants, which implied that shoot bending-induced release from apical dominance required gravisensing cells. Previous studies have shown that basipetal translocation of auxin from the apical <b>bud</b> inhibits <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> growth, whereas cytokinin promotes <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> outgrowth. We therefore compared the roles of auxin and cytokinin in bending- or decapitation-induced <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> growth. In the wild-type and we plants, decapitation increased cytokinin levels and reduced auxin response. In contrast, shoot bending did not cause significant changes in either cytokinin level or auxin response, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying gravity- and decapitation-regulated release from apical dominance are distinct and unique...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{decision}} for a bud {{to grow into}} a branch is a key regulatory process affecting plant architecture. In order to study molecular processes regulating <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> outgrowth in the model plant garden pea (Pisum sativum), we sequenced the <b>axillary</b> <b>bud</b> transcriptome and performed de novo transcriptome assembly...|$|R
