5|$|The {{idea for}} the film {{originated}} in the 1990s from a conversation in which Prasad joked with Rajamouli <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a fly seeking revenge against a human. Rajamouli reconsidered the idea after finishing Maryada Ramanna (2010), and Prasad developed it into a script. The film's production began on 7 December 2010 at Ramanaidu Studios in Hyderabad. Principal photography began on 22 February 2011 and continued until late February 2012. Makuta VFX and Annapurna Studios oversaw Eega visual effects and digital intermediate process, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{build-up}} for the pay-per-view {{began in}} the middle of May, plans were in the works behind the scenes for several months in advance. Tommy Dreamer was in charge of organizing the event and getting ECW Originals to participate. He contacted several people, including The Sandman, Sabu, Justin Credible, and ECW commentator Joey Styles. Reports later stated that Paul Heyman was working with Dreamer to help prepare the event. Other ECW related wrestlers were later added to the pay-per-view. The event was publicly confirmed by WWE through a Dish Network magazine in March 2005. In an interview with SLAM! Sports days before One Night Stand, ECW Original Rob Van Dam announced he had asked Vince McMahon <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> holding an ECW reunion event.|$|E

I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E

5|$|Newman {{himself had}} been {{regarded}} as a possible terrorist abduction target during the October Crisis, and armed guards had patrolled {{the headquarters of the}} NFB. Newman was concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> releasing films with Quebec nationalist themes, such as Groulx's 24 heures ou plus, at such a tense political time, worried about what the Canadian public would think. Although it was Newman's deputy André Lamy who in some cases drew the monolingual Newman's attention to the controversial nature of French language productions, it was Lamy himself who later permitted the release of some of these same films after he succeeded Newman as Government Film Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|Sarah invites Zoe {{to move in}} with her, however {{her father}} Mike is angry to find Zoe using Sarah's sister Amy Barnes' (Ashley Slanina-Davies) room. Kathy Barnes (Sarah Jane Buckley) begins to suspect an affair between Zoe and Mike, and throws all Zoe's clothes out into the street. Mike then asks Kathy to move out. He and Zoe sleep together, unknowingly {{recorded}} by Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson), who exposes them. Sarah lashes out at Mike and Zoe. She flaunts her older boyfriend Roger Kiddle (Quentin Tibble) in Mike's face, which backfires when Roger makes a pass at Zoe and they become an official couple. Sarah is able to forgive Zoe, and comforts her when she has a pregnancy scare. Mike is very upset <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Zoe being pregnant.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{had formed}} a number of factions. The Radical Republicans sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans. They {{believed}} that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in gratitude for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. They believed that top Confederates should be punished. The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because {{they believed that the}} freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states. They did not support African-American suffrage, which might threaten Democratic control in the South.|$|E
50|$|Ivan Naumov {{was born}} in the village of Oraovec, Veles region, in a poor family. Because of the lack of finances, {{he was not able to}} study and went to work in Thessaloniki.

5000|$|<b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> MIL in <b>the</b> 1980s, the {{historian}} François Audigier said: [...] "The MIL {{is a kind}} of ideological laboratory, which crossed the diverse influences of the liberal right, a reactionary Catholicism and a rigid Gaullism. It used an anti-immigration, pro-life, defense of private schools and the rejection of left-wing values, a package that had nothing to envy to the National Front's program".|$|R

Similar as Benoist, Mohler advocated a Right that would oppose both socialism and liberalism, with a decided emphasis on the latter. According to Michael Minkenberg, Mohler's ideas owed more to the Nouvelle Droite strain associated with GRECE than <b>the</b> Ostpolitik-derived <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> a strong German state associated with contemporaries such as Robert Spaemann and Gerd-Klaus Kaltenbrunner.|$|R

25|$|Additional {{confusion}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> dissonance {{is created}} {{by the fact that}} musicians and writers sometimes use the word dissonance and related terms in a precise and carefully defined way, more often in an informal way, and very often in a metaphorical sense ("rhythmic dissonance"). For many musicians and composers, the essential ideas of dissonance and resolution are vitally important ones that deeply inform their musical thinking on a number of levels.|$|E

Michael attended Davidson High School, where he met Andrew Farriss and they became good friends. Around this time, Hutchence and Farriss {{spent a lot of}} time jamming in the garage with Andrew's brothers. Farriss then convinced Hutchence to join his band, Doctor Dolphin, alongside two classmates, Kent Kerny and Neil Sanders. From nearby Forest High School, bass guitarist Garry Beers and Geoff Kennelly on drums filled out the line-up. The boys transferred to Davidson High School where they became serious <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> starting a proper band.

25|$|The best-known {{representative}} of the Bohemian Reformation is Jan Hus. He was an influential university teacher and a popular preacher in Bethlehem Chapel in the Old Town of Prague. The chapel was founded already in 1391 {{in the spirit of}} the nascent Bohemian Reformation. It was intended solely for sermons in the Czech language and it could admit 3,000 people. Jan Hus and his friends (e. g. Jacob of Mies) were skeptical <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> conciliarism which called for a church reform from above via cardinals and theologians. For them the cardinals and theologians were bearers of the same corruption as the papacy itself. Hus believed that the head of the Church was Jesus Christ rather than the pope. In some issues they were inspired by the ideas of an Oxford theologian and philosopher John Wycliffe. It can be seen in their cooperation with the secular power which supported them. Together with Wycliffe they thought that aristocracy could help the church to become poor and focused only on spiritual issues by confiscation of its property. In 1412 Jan Hus criticized selling indulgences which led to an unrest in Prague suppressed by the city council.|$|E
25|$|In April 2006 {{the borough}} council {{initiated}} public discussions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> turning the borough into a unitary authority; Ipswich had constituted a county borough from 1889 to 1974, {{independent of the}} administrative county of East Suffolk, and this status was not restored by the Banham/Cooksey Commission in the 1990s. Ipswich, Norwich, Exeter and Oxford united to campaign for unitary authority status for the four towns, hoping to use {{the window of opportunity}} presented by the October 2006 Local Government White Paper. In March 2007, it was announced that Ipswich was one of 16 shortlisted councils and on 25 July 2007, the secretary of state announced that she was minded to implement the unitary proposal for Ipswich, but that there were 'a number of risks relating to the financial case set out in the proposal', on which she invited Ipswich to undertake further work before a final decision was taken. Early in December plans were thrown into doubt as the government announced that it had 'delayed' the unitary bids for Ipswich and Exeter. In July 2008 the Boundary Committee announced its preferred option was for a unitary authority covering Ipswich and the south eastern corner of Suffolk, including Felixstowe.|$|E

25|$|Bošković visited Laibach, {{the capital}} of Carniola (now Ljubljana, Slovenia), at least in 1757, 1758, and 1763, and made contact with the Jesuits and the Franciscan Friars in the town. The Jesuits {{incorporated}} his teachings into their lectures at the Laibach Jesuit College. His physics became the foundation of physical lectures as well {{in other parts of}} the Habsburg Monarchy, and influenced the thought of Carl Scherffer, Gabriel Gruber, and Jurij Vega, the prominent physicists of the period.

He reads <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> philosophers such as Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, Thomas Jefferson, and Henry Thoreau, and these readings only serve to deepen his uncertainty in regards to the morality of the revolution.

25|$|Between 1780–1867, over 780 000 {{slaves were}} brought to Cuba. This was {{more than all the}} rest of Spanish America combined. Slavery was leaned upon heavily by the owners of the highly {{profitable}} sugar plantations. By 1886, people of colour – the majority being ex-slaves – made up 1/3 of the population of Cuba. The issue of integration was a complex and highly contentious issue. Rights were hard to come by for many former slaves and also for those who lived and worked in rural communities. Emancipation was a slow process that started in 1868 and continued until 1886. As a preliminary step, the Moret Law of 1870 granted freedom to children and those over the age of sixty but offered little else. As the skirmishes continued and losses compounded during the 10 Years’ War, the anti-colonial forces spoke more openly <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a free Cuban citizen. Even though there was still a strong racial divide, many slaves joined up with the revolutionaries. Although this initial rebellion did not force any significant changes, the participation of slaves did not go unnoticed. By the early 1890s, Spain was willing to offer fairly considerable civil rights and voting rights to many former slaves in a vain attempt to weaken another attempt at rebellion. Prior to the 1890s, suffrage had been granted uniquely to taxpayers (it was further expanded in 1895 and again in 1898 when all links between property and suffrage were severed). This back-fired, however, as it only provoked white elites who intensified their criticism directed at colonial policies.|$|E

Dot, disappointed <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> her great-grandchild being born out of wedlock, persuades Charlie to propose to Ronnie. She admits that she has killed a man and, in return, he admits that he is not a police officer and has been lying to Dot about Nick Cotton's (John Altman) death. Nick returns to Walford and reveals himself to Dot. Ronnie tells Charlie that she wants him gone. She threatens Nick, saying that he doesn't know what she's capable of. She asks Phil to give her the money stolen from her and Roxy so she can get rid of Nick, but he refuses. Ronnie steals all the money in his safe. On their wedding day, Phil finds out about the money, and agrees to kill Nick. He overhears this and angrily cuts the brakes on Ronnie's car. She goes into labour during the wedding reception, and Roxy and Charlie rush her to hospital, but crash the car in the square due to the cut brakes. Ronnie is rushed to hospital in a critical condition, where her son Matthew is delivered by an emergency Caesarean section. She is revived at the last minute, but is placed in a coma for several weeks, before she is finally woken up.|$|E
