5|$|As the 1984 U.S. presidential {{election}} primary season neared its end and Walter Mondale became the likely Democratic nominee, {{the idea of}} picking <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>as</b> his vice-presidential running mate gained considerable momentum. The National Organization for Women and the National Women's Political Caucus pushed the notion, as did several top Democratic figures such as Speaker Tip O'Neill. Women mentioned for the role included Ferraro and Mayor of San Francisco Dianne Feinstein, {{both of whom were}} on Mondale's five-person short list.|$|E
5|$|Henry's plans shifted {{when the}} Empress Matilda's husband, the Emperor Henry, died in 1125. King Henry {{recalled}} {{his daughter to}} England {{the next year and}} declared that, should he die without a male heir, she was to be his rightful successor. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have. Putting forward <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>as</b> a potential heir in this way was unusual: opposition to Matilda continued to exist within the English court, and Louis was vehemently opposed to her candidacy.|$|E

5000|$|The other genre tome, John Stanley's The Creature Features Movie Guide (1984 edition) {{described}} the lead characters as [...] "Priest Alex Nichol and wife Jeannie Crain", the villains as [...] "devil worshippers, {{who have just}} drowned <b>a</b> young <b>woman</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sacrifice" [...] and the film as a [...] "Low-budget job, inadequately directed by Lee Madden and leadenly scripted by Gil Lasky". The 1988 edition, John Stanley's Revenge of the Creature Features Movie Guide retains the misspelling [...] "Nichol", but corrects [...] "Jeannie" [...] to [...] "Jeanne" [...] and introduces an orthographic error by changing [...] "drowned <b>a</b> young <b>woman</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sacrifice" [...] to [...] "drowned <b>a</b> young <b>women</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sacrifice to Satan". The words [...] "to Satan" [...] are newly added to the 1988 edition. The 1994 edition, John Stanley's Creature Features Movie Guide Strikes Again further expands the sentence so that it states, with the same orthographic error, [...] "drowned <b>a</b> <b>women</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sacrifice to Satan, and now they're being terrorized by the religious fanatics".|$|R
5|$|Historically, East Asian {{cultures}} viewed {{long hair}} {{as a sign}} of youth and aesthetic beauty. Long hair is associated with private life and sexuality. East Asian cultures see long, unkempt hair in <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>as</b> a sign of sexual intent or a recent sexual encounter, as usually their hair is tied up. Lay Buddhists have long hair, while Buddhist monks have shaved heads.|$|E
5|$|During the 1936–39 Arab {{revolt against}} British Mandate rule, Deir Ghassaneh {{was the scene}} of rebel gatherings and British {{military}} raids. In 1967, Bani Zeid was occupied by Israel during the Six-Day War, but it was transferred to full Palestinian security and administrative control in 2000. The next year it became the first Palestinian-controlled town to be the site of major operation by Israeli forces during the Second Intifada. When Fathiya Barghouti Rheime was elected mayor in 2005, Bani Zeid became the first Palestinian locality with <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>as</b> head of the municipality, in concurrence with nearby Ramallah. The current mayor is Abdel Karim Abu Aql, elected in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Paralleling along Interstate 44, {{the tornado}} moved into McClain County, where it crossed the highway twice at F4 intensity, killing <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>as</b> she was blown out from an {{underpass}} {{where she was}} attempting to seek shelter, after being dragged down the embankment by the intense channeling winds; her 11-year-old son − with whom the woman vacated their stalled car nearby − survived, staying held tight onto the steel girders of the overpass. A man who helped the mother and son up the overpass suffered severe injuries to his leg, which was partially sliced by a highway sign thrown by the winds. At 7:10p.m. CDT, a satellite tornado touched down over an open field north of Newcastle; it was rated as an F0 {{due to lack of}} damage. 38 homes and two businesses were destroyed in McClain County, and 40 homes were flattened; some of these homes were leveled at F4 intensity, and 17 people were injured.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} {{of sexual activity}} between women as necessary to define a lesbian or a relationship continues to be debated. According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women's sexuality is constructed by men, whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women. The same indicator {{is not necessary to}} identify <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>as</b> heterosexual, however. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women are as important or more so than the genital. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the feminist sex wars. Butch and femme roles returned, although not as strictly followed {{as they were in the}} 1950s. They became a mode of chosen sexual self-expression for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.|$|E
5|$|While many {{versions}} of the tale exist, Ila is usually described as a daughter or son of Vaivasvata Manu and thus the sibling of Ikshvaku, {{the founder of the}} Solar Dynasty. In versions in which Ila is born female, she changes into a male form by divine grace soon after her birth. After mistakenly entering a sacred grove as an adult, Ila is either cursed to change his/her gender every month or cursed to become <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b> <b>As</b> a woman, Ilā married Budha, the god of the planet Mercury and the son of the lunar deity Chandra (Soma), and bore him a son called Pururavas, the father of the Lunar dynasty. After the birth of Pururavas, Ilā is transformed into a man again and fathered three sons.|$|E
5|$|Rabi's Molecular Beam Laboratory {{began to}} attract others, {{including}} Sidney Millman, {{a graduate student}} who studied lithium for his doctorate. Another was Jerrold Zacharias who, believing that the sodium nucleus would be too difficult to understand, proposed studying the simplest of the elements, hydrogen. Its deuterium isotope had only recently been discovered at Columbia in 1931 by Urey, who received the 1934 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work. Urey was able to supply them with both heavy water and gaseous deuterium for their experiments. Despite its simplicity, Stern's group in Hamburg had observed that hydrogen did not behave as predicted. Urey also helped in another way; he gave Rabi half his prize money to fund the Molecular Beam Laboratory. Other scientists whose careers began at the Molecular Beam Laboratory included Norman Ramsey, Julian Schwinger, Jerome Kellogg and Polykarp Kusch. All were men; Rabi {{did not believe that}} women could be physicists. He never had <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>as</b> a doctoral or postdoctoral student, and generally opposed women as candidates for faculty positions.|$|E

5|$|The ballads are characterised {{by sexual}} {{encounters}} between everyday people and human(-like) beings {{referred to in}} at least some variants as elves (the same characters also appear as mermen, dwarves, and other kinds of supernatural beings). The elves pose a threat to the everyday community by trying to lure people to into the elves' world. Much the most popular example is Elveskud and its many variants (paralleled in English as Clerk Colvill), where a woman from the elf-world tries to tempt a young knight to join her in dancing, or simply to live among the elves; in some versions he refuses and in some he accepts, but in either case he dies, tragically. As in Elveskud, sometimes the everyday person is a man and the elf <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>as</b> also in Elvehøj (much the same story as Elveskud, but with a happy ending), Herr Magnus og Bjærgtrolden, Herr Tønne af Alsø, Herr Bøsmer i elvehjem, or the Northern British Thomas the Rhymer. Sometimes the everyday person is a woman and the elf is a man, as in the northern British Tam Lin, The Elfin Knight, and Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight, in which the Elf-Knight bears away Isabel to murder her, or the Scandinavian Harpans kraft. In The Queen of Elfland's Nourice, a woman is abducted to be a wet-nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.|$|E
