40|$|Abstract—This paper {{studies the}} ergodic {{capacity}} of a multicell distributed antenna system (DAS), where remote <b>antenna</b> <b>ports</b> are spread within each cell to cooperatively transmit to user terminals. Unlike most prior studies which assume the <b>antenna</b> <b>ports</b> to be deployed at fixed locations, this paper assumes the <b>antenna</b> <b>ports</b> to be distributed as a spatial Poisson point process (PPP) {{to account for the}} fact that in practice the <b>antenna</b> <b>ports</b> are randomly placed to cover wherever the dead spots are. We first model DAS within each cell as a downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel with per-antenna power constraint while accounting for inter-cell (inter-cluster) interference. Two DAS layouts are considered: the “regular ” layout where the <b>antenna</b> <b>ports</b> are randomly deployed within regular cellular boundary to serve a given user, and the “user-centric ” layout where the <b>antenna</b> <b>ports</b> are distributed over a wide area and the users choose the surrounding <b>antenna</b> <b>ports</b> to form a “virtual cell” as its own serving antenna subset. Using the tool of stochastic geometry, we analytically derive efficiently computable ergodic capacity expressions for the two layouts of DAS. Using these expressions, the cell-edge capacity of DAS under the regular layout is shown to be upper-bounded by α 2, where α is the pathloss exponent. Numerical results show that the proposed analytical model can accurately model the first layout, and can well approximate the second layout when the serving radius of users is not large. Compared to the traditional cellular system where all antennas are co-located at the cell center, DAS has better cell-edge performance. Further, the user-centric DAS has higher capacity than the DAS under regular layout. I...|$|R

40|$|Self-interference between digital {{interfaces}} and on-board wireless modules and antennas {{is rapidly}} becoming {{a major problem}} for Printed Circuit Board engineers. In this paper, the severity of on-board self-interference is quantified. Two working conditions are considered. First, the situation is considered in which the antenna is in receive mode. As the incoming (signal) fields are most often rather low, only small (signal) voltages are induced at the <b>antenna</b> <b>port.</b> It is shown with a simple example that the level of the noise voltage induced at the <b>antenna</b> <b>port</b> due to the switching of digital interfaces can be significant compared to the signal voltage, thereby leading to a low Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Second, the situation is considered in which the antenna is in transmit mode. As the power radiated by the on-board antenna can be quite large (e. g. typically 2 Watt for GSM), the signal voltages at the <b>antenna</b> <b>port</b> can be quite large. With the same simple example, it is shown that this leads to a significant noise signal at the digital interfaces, thereby increasing the Bit Error Rate. status: publishe...|$|E

30|$|Now {{with regard}} to the third rule, the channel {{selectivity}} order (i.e., maximum number of independent channel fading) for pattern P 1 is equal to 2 for all GF symbols, a, b, c, and d. This is clear since any of these GF symbols is mapped onto exactly two QAM symbols within only one single STBC codeword, with the first QAM symbol transmitted on the first <b>antenna</b> <b>port</b> and the second QAM symbol transmistted on the second <b>antenna</b> <b>port.</b> For pattern P 2 however, the channel selectivity order is higher and equal to 3, since any GF symbol is mapped onto exactly three QAM symbols transmitted within three different STBC codewords, hence ideally subject to three independent channel fading. The last pattern P 3 has its channel selectivity order equal to 2 for the edge symbols a and d (since carried in two QAM symbols within one single STBC codeword), whereas it is equal to 3 for the middle symbols b and c (since these are carried in two QAM symbols within two STBC codewords). Amongst all three patterns, only P 1 and P 3 respect the second rule, but only P 3 which further respects the third rule as it attempts to achieve the highest possible channel selectivity order under the constraint of the second rule.|$|E
