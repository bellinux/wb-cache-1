5|$|The Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels is an {{international}} initiative which brings together farmers, companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and scientists who <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sustainability of biofuels production and distribution. During 2008, the Roundtable used meetings, teleconferences, and online discussions to develop a series of principles and criteria for sustainable biofuels production.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology {{also has}} some overlap with archaeology, which {{primarily}} works with objects made by humans and with human remains, while paleontologists <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> characteristics and evolution of humans as organisms. When dealing with evidence about humans, archaeologists and paleontologists may work together– for example paleontologists might identify animal or plant fossils around an archaeological site, to discover what {{the people who lived}} there ate; or they might analyze the climate at the time when the site was inhabited by humans.|$|E

5|$|A furry {{convention}} (also furry con or fur con) is {{a formal}} gathering {{of members of}} the furry fandom — people who <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> concept of fictional non-human animal characters with human characteristics. These conventions provide a place for fans to meet, exchange ideas, transact business and engage in entertainment and recreation centered on this concept. Originating in California, United States, during the mid-1980s, there are now over 40 annual furry conventions worldwide, mostly in North America and Europe. The largest furry convention is Anthrocon which is held each year in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2s {{story is}} brought out via {{narrative}} pre-rendered cutscenes, the pre- and post-mission briefings, {{as well as}} in-game chatter between non-player characters, and scripted mission events. The structure for the story is linear without any branching paths for alternate storylines, though there are optional covert missions which can further flesh out the story. The story can only be continued by clearing missions and progressing through the campaign. However, players are given the option to skip a mission if they have failed it five times in a row. This gives those who <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story, but less skilled, the chance to continue on with the story without frustration.|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa {{produces}} several structurally related hexaketide {{compounds that}} have attracted attention for their biological properties: pregaliellalactone, galiellalactone. The compounds have anti-nematodal activity, killing the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and Meloidogyne incognita. These compounds {{have been shown}} in laboratory tests to inhibit the early steps of the biosynthetic pathways induced by plant hormones known as gibberellic acids, and they also inhibit the germination of seeds of several plants. Galiellalactone is additionally a highly selective and potent inhibitor of interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling in HepG2 cells. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine which is produced by a large variety of cells and functions as a regulator of immune response, acute phase reactions, and hematopoiesis. Researchers <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> potential of small-molecule inhibitors (such as the ones produced by G.rufa) {{to interfere with the}} IL-6 signaling cascade that leads to the expression of genes involved in disease.|$|E

It is our task to inquire into the causes that have brought about the observed differentiation, and to investigate {{the sequence of events}} that have led to the establishment of the multifarious forms of human life. In other words, we <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anatomical and mental characteristics of men living under the same biological, geographical, and social environment, and as determined by their past.|$|E

The hydrogen byproduct of fermentation is instead converted into acetate, which is then used to provide further energy. Scientists <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> possibility of transferring the bacteria responsible from kangaroos to cattle, since the greenhouse gas effect of methane is 23 times {{greater than that of}} carbon dioxide, per molecule.|$|E
