40|$|It {{was found}} that {{exposure}} of hemagglutinating sera to pressures {{of the order of}} 3, 000 to 4, 000 atmospheres destroyed their <b>agglutinating</b> <b>power,</b> but did not convert them to inhibiting ("blocking") antibodies. Higher pressures (4, 500 to 5, 500 atmospheres) were required to destroy inhibiting anti-Rh 0 antibodies in a "blocking" serum. This conforms with ideas already held that the "blocking" antibodies are significantly more stable than the agglutinating antibodies...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{cultural}} and agglutinating reactions of seventeen strains of Morgan bacilli is reported. The cultures were obtained from different sources. Culturally all the strains were identical. Antigenically they were highly diversified. The sera produced against some strains have marked <b>agglutinating</b> <b>power</b> for other strains, but absorption tests showed that the cross-agglutinations were often due to group agglutinins. While no conclusion can be drawn regarding the pathogenic significance of this bacillus, the wide diversities of antigenic properties raise {{the question as to}} the specific relationship of the various cultures met with as well as their relation to a definite class of pathological processes in man...|$|E
40|$|Antipneumococcus serum {{under certain}} {{conditions}} apparently inhibits or retards the metabolic activities of the homologous pneumococcus. Antipneumococcus serum exhausted of its agglutinin content possesses no inhibitory properties. The degree of inhibitory action of antipneumococcus serum parallels its <b>agglutinating</b> <b>power.</b> No evidence {{has been found to}} indicate that the inhibition of the metabolic activities of the pneumococcus by antipneumococcus serum is due to a specific antienzymotic property of the serum. The evidence which has been obtained indicates that the apparent inhibition of metabolic activity that occurs {{under certain conditions}} is due to agglutination of the pneumococci by the antipneumococcus serum and their consequent inability to grow in intimate contact with the whole medium. Antistaphylococcus serum inhibits the liquefaction of gelatin and the formation of pigment by Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus. Further experimentation is necessary to determine the mechanism of this inhibitory action. Antistaphylococcus serum does not inhibit those metabolic activities of Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus essential to the growth and multiplication of the organisms...|$|E
40|$|In the {{production}} of immune serum for therapeutic purposes strict attention must {{be paid to the}} immunological specificity of the bacteria used for immunization. At present the only serum of which the therapeutic value has been proven is that effective against Type I pneumococcus infection. This serum should have <b>agglutinating</b> <b>power</b> for Type I pneumococcus and should have the power of protecting mice against large amounts of virulent culture. Experiments have shown that for producing the primary immunity most rapidly several series of small doses of dead cultures should be given, the injections being made daily for 6 to 7 days, followed by a week in which no injections are made. To produce the highest type of immunity probably living organisms are required. These should be given in moderate doses daily for 3 days, with an interval of a week between each series of injections. By following accurately the methods described, horses may be made to produce rapidly a high grade of specific serum. The observations so far made indicate the importance of employing small doses of culture frequently repeated in this form of immunization...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown by our {{experiments}} that the serum of rabbits treated with emulsions of Treponema pallidum contains agglutinating substances. Normal rabbit serum also possesses <b>agglutinating</b> <b>power</b> for this organism, but, {{as in the case}} of normal bacterial agglutinins, to an extent very much inferior to that possessed by the sera of immunized animals. Normal human sera will agglutinate similar pallidum emulsions, as will the sera of certain syphilitic patients with positive Wassermann reactions. Whether or not there is a quantitative difference of diagnostic value between the sera of normal human beings and those of syphilitics remains to be seen. The sera of rabbits immunized with strain A agglutinate Noguchi's strain 9 in dilutions as high as 1 to 500. We regard as the most important result of these experiments the demonstration of definite antibodies in the circulation of animals treated with dead emulsions of Treponema pallidum. Since it is our belief that the agglutinating effect is due to an antibody essentially the same as that which produces bactericidal, precipitating, and opsonic effects, i. e., that there is probably one type of antibody only, we believe that the demonstration of agglutinins establishes the fact that in syphilis as in bacterial diseases the host responds by the formation of antibodies or sensitizers specific for the treponema. Spirocheticidal experiments with these sera, both in vitro and in vivo, are in progress...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{numerous}} clinical and experimental investigations on antipneumococcic serum, its exact x 61 e in pneumococcus infection is still relatively obscure. The {{purpose of this}} communication is to report experiments which show that antipneumococcic serum contains an important therapeutic factor, which is not antibacterial in character. The current opinion is that the protective antibody in the serum is antibacterial. In 1915, Bull (1), in studying the effect of serura on pneumococcus septicemia in rabbits, suggested that the protective antibody acts in vivo {{by virtue of its}} <b>agglutinating</b> <b>power,</b> and that the survival or death of the animal depends upon the destruction of the agglutinated organisms by the phagocytic cells of the blood and tissues. Cole (2), Dochez and Avery (3), and others showed that in pneumococcus-infected exudates and sera as wall as during the growth of the organisms in vitro, there is present a soluble substance, which can combine with the immune bodies of the serum, and thus detract from its action against the organisms. The later studies of Heidelberger and Avery (4), and others on the chemical constitution of pneumococcus protoplasm had established this soluble specific substance as the chief capsular constituent, a carbohydrate fraction of the organism responsible for its type specificity and virulence. The subsequent work of Felton and Bailey (5) indicated that this purified carbohydrate soluble specific substance was capable of neutralizing the protective antibody. Thus it appeared that the func-* I am indebted to Professor William H. Park for his continued interest and stimulating criticism throughout the course of this work. I also wish to than...|$|E
40|$|Cholera-like non-agglutinating vibrios are {{invariably}} {{found in}} the intestinal contents of healthy persons, and frequently in the water of wells and rivers, during epidemics of cholera. Although many of these saprophytic vibrios are indistinguishable in morphology and cultural properties from the cholera vibrio, the negative reaction with an anticholera serum has readily differentiated them from the Asiatic vibrio. The biological polymorphism of the cholera vibrio has been suggested {{by the development of}} agglutination, by special methods of culture, in cholera-like vibrios. Confirmatory Pfeiffer reactions have not been obtained, as a rule, in these instances, probably because of the low virulence of the vibrio culture, although positive bacteriolysis in vitro (Bordet's test) was observed in some, and in others positive complement fixation and cross agglutination indicated the cholera nature of the vibrios in question. Although it cannot as yet be definitely proven, we are justified in suspecting that cholera-like vibrios which eventually develop agglutination properties are of a true cholera nature. It is probable that the production of agglutination antibodies in the serum brings about the development by the bacterial cell of defensive anti-agglutinins, resulting in the disappearance of <b>agglutinating</b> <b>power.</b> In the case of the water vibrios, changed physical conditions could bring about a similar alteration in biological properties. It may be said that the absence of agglutination in a vibrio isolated from a suspected source does not define conclusively its noncholera nature. In all probability among a number of cholera-like vibrios isolated from suspected sources a certain percentage will eventually be found to develop agglutination either during laboratory cultivation or by means of animal passage, and until subjected to a procedure that will induce the return of agglutination no vibrio can be regarded with assurance as of a truly saprophytic variety...|$|E
40|$|The results {{observed}} with this strain of Treponema pallidum may be stated as follows: 1. Normal human serum did not agglutinate this culture of Treponema pallidum in dilutions of 1 : 5 or higher; equal parts of treponema culture and normal serum (dilution 1 : 2) resulted in agglutination in about 50 per {{cent of the}} sera. With the strain of Treponema pallidum {{used in this study}} specific agglutination was not considered as having occurred unless observed in dilutions of 1 : 5 or higher. 2. The <b>agglutinating</b> <b>power</b> of the sera of non-syphilitic persons suffering with various infections was not higher than that of normal sera. 3. Traces of specific agglutinin for this culture of Treponema pallidum were found in the sera of persons late in the primary stage of syphilis. 4. In the secondary stage of syphilis about 58 per cent of sera showed the presence of a demonstrable amount of agglutinin in dilutions of 1 : 5 and higher; in no instance, however, was agglutination in evidence in dilutions higher than 1 : 20. 5. In tertiary and latent syphilis, mostly infections of the central nervous system, agglutination in dilutions of 1 : 5 and higher was found with about 84 per cent of sera. The highest concentration of pallida agglutinin in the blood serum was found in the later stages of syphilis. 6. The formation of agglutinin for culture Treponema pallidum in human syphilis is probably tardy and does not reach a state of high concentration. 7. There was no direct relation between the presence of the Wassermann antibody and agglutinin for this strain in the sera of syphilitics. The former appears in the body fluids earlier and is probably in higher concentration in all stages of syphilis; while agglutination is most likely to occur with Wassermann positive sera, it may be occasionally {{observed with}} sera yielding negative Wassermann reactions. Likewise strongly Wassermann positive sera may not contain demonstrable amounts of agglutinin. 8. It is probable that different strains of pallida vary in susceptibility to agglutination. For example, in the first investigation on agglutinins for Treponema pallidum by Kolmer, the sera of syphilitics in different stages of the disease did not cause agglutination of one of Noguchi's strains in dilutions of 1 : 20 and higher, whereas the strain {{used in the present study}} was frequently agglutinated in this dilution by sera from a similar group of patients. As shown by Zinsser, Hopkins, and McBurney, virulent pallida from human lesions resist agglutination to a remarkable degree. 9. While further studies are necessary to establish the practical value of agglutination in the diagnosis of human syphilis, we believe that with a suitable culture or cultures well marked agglutination of Treponema pallidum in dilutions of 1 : 5, or better 1 : 10 and higher, indicates pallida infection and may prove of value in the diagnosis of isolated cases, particularly in the later stages. Investigations bearing upon the relation of agglutinins for culture pallida to immunity in syphilis will be given in a separate communication (16) ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThis study {{involved}} work with extracts {{of the seeds}} of Bauhinia purpurea alba, in which an N specific lectin was found by Mäkelä (37) and Boyd and McMaster (16). There were two main purposes in mind. First, {{to see if the}} lectin could be of practical use as a typing sera; and secondly, to get some insight into its chemical make-up. After working out a purification method and a method for checking the <b>agglutinating</b> <b>power</b> of the lectin, the lectin was tested against several small samples. The writer then tested this lectin against 90 random blood samples. The lectin disagreed with rabbit anti-N in one case [...] the lectin typed one MN as an M. There is as yet no known reason for this difference, so it would seem that one could not use the lectin as a typing sera at the present time. The lectin was treated with formaldehyde and lost all its activity as a result. Erythrocytes were treated with an enzyme, ficin, and were then reacted with the lectin. The results showed an increase in the titer of the lectin, and the specificity of the lectin was lost. The freezing of a sample of the lectin for four months resulted in the loss of some of its activity. It remained specific, however. Upon dialyzing the crude extract against saline or water, the substances (Y) that remained behind in the membrane became nonspecific. This showed that there were at least two parts to the extract, one of large molecular weight because it would not pass through the membrane, and the other smaller in size because it would pass through the membrane. The substance that passed through the membrane was called X. By dialyzing the crude extract against distilled water and lyophilizing the distilled water, a substance was found which gave the reaction of a sugar and also seemed to have either or both glucosamine and galactosamine present. Since X showed the presence of reducing sugars and could be shown to inhibit Y against the M site on erythrocytes (see Table 7), it was thought that some sugars should be tested against Y to see if any of them would be able to inhibit Y. The same sugars were also tested against the lectin (Table 5). It was found that none of the sugars had any effect on the lectin; but raffinose, melibiose, and galactose all were found to inhibit Y (Table 8). It has also been shown by other workers (13) that lactose will inhibit Y. The inhibition of the sugars against lectin and Y were run in three ways. The first was the usual inhibition method where the inhibiting substance (sugar, in this case) is placed with the substance to be inhibited (Y) and incubated for one hour. Then the appropriate erythrocyte was added. The second method was to place erythrocytes, Y, and sugar all in the same tube at the same time. The third was to incubate sugar and erythrocytes together and then add Y. The results are given in Table 9. It was found by the writer that Method 2 was the best. This agrees with Krüpe as cited in Mäkelä (37) who states that if an appropriate sugar is added to erythrocytes that are agglutinated by a lectin, the lectin will leave the erythrocytes and pick up the sugar. This is shown by the breaking up of the clumps of erythrocytes. The sugars that would inhibit Y were tried against adsorbed rabbit sera, both anti-M and N. The sugars showed no effect against the rabbit sera. The writer feels that the lectin may not be as specific as the rabbit sera; thus, these inhibiting sugars may only be closely related to the true configuration of the M site...|$|E
