40|$|Local {{circulation}} {{features in}} complex terrain {{are often not}} resolved in today’s mesoscale numerical weather prediction and research models. For urban areas embedded in complex terrain a prediction of the local circulation is, however, of high importance, as {{it can lead to}} adverse conditions for the urban population. One example is local stagnation of the flow in the stably stratified valley atmosphere, also referred to as cold air pools. Under such conditions even small to medium sized cities can experience exceedances of legislative thresholds for urban air quality. In this study I therefore explore and apply a novel integrated approach for micro-climate scenario studies in complex terrain, reflecting a new type of statistical dynamical downscaling based on Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The recurring wintertime urban <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> events in Bergen, Norway, serve hereby as a concrete case-study. The work presented consists of four scientific manuscripts. The first manuscript describes the local observational perspective. I used measurements with an MTP- 5 HE microwave temperature profiler to characterise the local temperature inversions and their connection to the urban <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes.</b> The study revealed new information on the occurrence and structure of the temperature inversions in the Bergen valley. Temperature inversions are a common phenomenon in Bergen, especially during the winter. For example, during December 2012 and February 2013, more than 60 % of the measurements taken under fair weather conditions (no rain or clouds below 600 m) between 18 : 00 and 8 : 00 UTC, showed inversions. The average depth of persistent temperature inversions that are lasting longer than two hours is mostly below 270 m, with a maximum in the distribution at 170 m. Both, NO 2 and PM 2. 5 <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> are highly associated with persistent temperature inversions that are around 220 m deep. Such long and consistent studies of the lowlevel temperature inversions with microwave profilers are scarce. This study also served as the observational basis for all further work described here. The second and fourth manuscripts describe the large-scale and long-term perspective. We developed a simple atmospheric circulation proxy that empirically links the essentially local phenomenon of urban <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> inside the Bergen valley to the circulation above it. This allowed us to assess the long-term variability of the occurrence of the <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes,</b> both forward and backward in time. We also analysed the relevance of the large-scale circulation for the <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of their external steering parameters. <b>Air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> in Bergen cluster during some winters and are almost absent during others. The recurrence time for consecutive winters with such clustering was approximately 10 – 15 years but varies strongly. We found no change in their future potential occurrence. <b>Air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> are often connected to certain persistent features of the large-scale flow. This persistence is, however, not necessarily steered by anticyclonic blockings directly over Western Norway, contrary to prior assumptions. The third manuscript describes the local modelling perspective. Based on the knowledge of the reduced parameter space of the circulation above the Bergen valley during observed <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes,</b> we studied the local circulation during these events. We used high resolution LES simulations over a comparatively large domain. The study revealed the relevance of the interplay between the circulation forced by the large-scale flow and a local land breeze in the Bergen valley. This local breeze is controlled by the warm fjord and cold land temperature differences. Certain regimes of this large-to-small scale interaction worsen the local stagnation and hence increase the accumulation of the locally emitted pollutants. Parts of the above described methodology were exploited in an applied research project. We investigated the impact of ships in the Bergen harbour on the local pollutant concentrations during <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes.</b> Further research and development in this direction are highly valuable for impact assessments of future infrastructure projects. The methodology is computationally demanding. However, the continuing growth of available computing facilities and further developments of the LES models will improve its accessibility and realism. </p...|$|R
40|$|Severe <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> {{have been}} {{frequent}} in China {{during the recent}} years. While high emissions are {{the primary reason for}} increasing pollutant concentrations, the ultimate cause for the most severe <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> has remained unclear. Here we show that a high concentration of particulate matter (PM) will enhance the stability of an urban boundary layer, which in turn decreases the boundary layer height and consequently cause further increases in PM concentrations. We estimate the strength of this positive feedback mechanism by combining a new theoretical framework with ambient observations. We show that the feedback remains moderate at fine PM concentrations lower than about 200 mu g m(- 3), but that it becomes increasingly effective at higher PM loadings resulting from the combined effect of high surface PM emissions and massive secondary PM production within the boundary layer.

From eroding the celebrated monuments to causing a plethora of illnesses, Cairo has suffered greatly from its <b>air</b> <b>pollution.</b> How much longer will it stay there? The {{question of how to}} most effectively reduce this pollution remains unanswered for Cairo and other mega cities in the developing countries. The <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> arose as another priority for Who???. Regardless of actions by the Government, the Egyptian media carried the issue extensively. This in part led to serious attention by Egypt’s Prime Minister and the Parliament. With integrated messages working in various air monitoring and analysis findings to explain <b>air</b> <b>pollution,</b> its causes, what the government and others are doing, and what outcomes had been realized. This study gives basic description and analysis of black cloud formation due to accumulation of pollution from different sources and the effect of the meteorological conditions. There are numerous sources to <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> in Egypt as in other countries. However, the formation and levels of dust, small particles, and soot are more characteristic in Egypt than presently found in industrialized countries. Some of the sources for these pollutants, such as industries, open-air solid waste burning, and transportation were also 20 years ago well known problems in most countries. The time of black cloud formation over Cairo city is always in parallel to the period of rice straw burning by farmers in the delta Governorates especially Dakahlya, Sharkia, and Kalyobia which are the nearest Governorates to Cairo. The metrological conditions of very low wind speed and cold temperature causes the phenomena of thermal inversion. Remote Sensing is the best means of acquiring basic information particularly on the regional scale and through a repetitive schedule. By using this technology we can detect and monitor the sources of burning the rice straw in the delta region.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] In December 1991 London {{experienced}} a unique <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>episode</b> during which concentrations of nitrogen dioxide rose to record levels, associated with moderate increases in black smoke. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate whether this episode was associated with adverse health effects and whether any such effects could be attributed to air pollution. METHODS [...] The numbers of deaths and hospital admissions occurring in Greater London during the week of the episode were compared with those predicted using data from the week before the episode and from equivalent periods from the previous four years. Relative risks (RR) (episode week versus predicted) for adverse health events were estimated using log linear modelling and these were compared with estimates from control areas which had similar cold weather but without increased air pollution. RESULTS [...] In all age groups mortality was increased for all causes (excluding accidents) (relative risk = 1. 10) and cardiovascular diseases (1. 14); non-significant increases were observed for all respiratory diseases (1. 22), obstructive lung diseases (1. 23), and respiratory infections (1. 23). In the elderly (65 + years) the relative risk of hospital admission was increased for all respiratory diseases (1. 19) and for obstructive lung diseases (1. 43), and a non-significant increase was observed for ischaemic heart disease (1. 04). In children (0 - 14 years) there was no increase in admissions for all respiratory diseases and only a small non-significant increase for asthma. When compared with control areas the relative risks became non-significant but remained increased. CONCLUSIONS [...] The <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>episode</b> was associated with an increase in mortality and morbidity which was unlikely to be explained by the prevailing weather, a coincidental respiratory epidemic, or psychological factors due to publicity.

30|$|The {{resulting}} <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> from veld fires {{may also}} be a source of public health risks and psychological distress as it alters the natural concentrations of atmospheric gases. For example, ozone, a component of <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> is associated with negative emotions and aggressive behaviors (Evans & Kantrowitz 2002). Rotton (1983) reported that bad odors that often accompany <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> cause evaluative and cognitive deficiencies as well as behavioral disorders. However, beside the estimates of trace gas emissions from burning conducted {{more than a decade ago}} by Chenje et al. (1998) and Scholes & Andreae (2000), presently there is no data on the impacts of burning on atmospheric concentrations of gases and on psychological distress in Zimbabwe.|$|R
