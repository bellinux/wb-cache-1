It was quite easy." [...] Clarkson also admitted that [...] "Because of You" [...] is the most depressing song she has ever written. Despite the revelation, she told Entertainment Weekly in August 2011 that she wanted to be remembered for the song because she had to work hard to get it on Breakaway (2004) when everyone was against it. She added, [...] "I think I’m most proud of that song – just getting it on an album because no one liked it until it hit no. 1 worldwide <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>was</b> on board." ...|$|E

500|$|The team {{continued}} their resurgence into the 2006 season, finishing {{with a record}} of 13–3. During the season, Urlacher had one of the best performances of his professional career against the Arizona Cardinals. He helped the Bears overcome a 20-point deficit by recording 19 tackles and a forced fumble that was returned for a touchdown. Teammate Devin Hester commented on Urlacher's performance, stating, [...] "We watched the film <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>was</b> saying that he just turned into the Incredible Hulk the last four minutes of the game, just killing people and running over and tackling whoever had the ball." [...] The Bears won the NFC Championship against the New Orleans Saints, 39–14, but lost Super Bowl XLI to the Indianapolis Colts, 29–17. Urlacher finished the season with 93 tackles and three forced fumbles.

I became a baby <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>was</b> so caring towards me." [...] In the book Film Sequels, Carolyn Jess-Cooke drew similarities between the character and Forrest Gump, portrayed by Tom Hanks in the titular film, but this idea was dismissed by Roshan. Film critics were polarised on {{their view of the}} film—some of them negatively compared its storyline to the 1982 Hollywood release E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial—but were unanimous in their praise for Roshan. In a 2010 retrospective of the Top 80 Iconic Performances of Bollywood, Filmfare noted [...] "how flesh and blood Hrithik's act is. Simply because he believes he is the part. Watch him laugh, cry or bond with his remote controlled alien friend and note his nuanced turn." [...] A Rediff.com critic agreed that Roshan was [...] "the turbojet that propels the film to the realm of the extraordinary". Koi... Mil Gaya was the most popular Bollywood film of the year, earning , and Roshan won both Filmfare Awards for Best Actor and Best Actor (Critics).|$|E

500|$|Mendes avoided using close-ups, as he {{believed}} the technique was overused; he also cited Spielberg's advice that he should imagine an audience silhouetted {{at the bottom of}} the camera monitor, to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a [...] screen. Spielberg—who visited the set a few times—also advised Mendes not to worry about costs if he had a [...] "great idea" [...] toward the end of a long working day. Mendes said, [...] "That happened three or four times, and they are all in the movie." [...] Despite Spielberg's support, DreamWorks and Mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget, although the studio interfered little with the film's content. Spacey, Bening and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates. American Beauty cost DreamWorks $15million to produce, slightly above their projected sum. Mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days' filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to reshoot the scenes. He said, [...] "I started with a wrong scene, actually, a comedy scene. And the actors played it way too big: it was badly shot, my fault, badly composed, my fault, bad costumes, my fault; <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>was</b> doing what I was asking. It was all my fault." [...] Aware that he was a novice, Mendes drew on the experience of Hall: [...] "I made a very conscious decision early on, if I didn't understand something technically, to say, without embarrassment, 'I don't understand what you're talking about, please explain it.|$|E

Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>was</b> shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career.

Naomi Watts commented that the atmosphere [...] "felt emblematic of how it feels onstageat least my long-time memories from long ago".

2500|$|Watermark {{opens with}} a same-titled {{instrumental}} track with wordless vocals, a tradition that Enya continued on her next three studio albums. Its title derived from a poem Roma was writing {{at the time of}} recording, which inspired her to name the track accordingly. However, the track was kept as an instrumental and the poem was left unused. It was printed {{for the first time in}} the liner notes for Enya's 2002 box set, Only Time – The Collection. During a meeting with Enya, Diana, Princess of Wales revealed that [...] "Watermark" [...] was a favourite of hers. [...] "Cursum Perficio" [...] came about after Enya and the Ryans had seen a documentary on American actress and model Marilyn Monroe, who once wrote the phrase on the tiles on her front doorstep. It means [...] "Your journey ends here" [...] in Latin, and Roma completed a set of Latin lyrics based around the phrase. Enya wanted her vocals to be [...] "bold and up-front" [...] like that of a choral piece, and realised early on that translating its lyrics into English or Gaelic would not complement the music, so Latin was used. [...] "On Your Shore" [...] refers to Magheragallon Beach at Enya's hometown of Gweedore, County Donegal that houses a cemetery where her grandparents are buried. Its emotional and personal connection to her childhood inspired her to write it. She explained, [...] "When the first people lived in Gweedore, there was a sort of shelter for the fishermen ... The sea came in when there was a sermon going on <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>was</b> wiped out. There are a lot of stories like that, where we would start to talk about them and a song would evolve." [...] It was written as an instrumental at first, but Enya and Nicky found lyrics suited the track better. Numerous [...] "vocal experiments" [...] were tried out for it, but neither suited the music, so it took the more simple form of a single lead vocal with one synthesiser. The clarinet solo was originally sung on its demo, but Nicky suggested a clarinet was the most suitable instrument which suited the vocals she used when singing it.|$|E
