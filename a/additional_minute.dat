50|$|Puerto Rican {{version is}} perhaps the most notable and flavorful in Latin America. The rice is cooked with sofrito as a base. The rice is also dyed yellow from the annatto oil (olive oil that has been infused with annatto seeds). Once the oil is hot salchichas are usually added. Sofrito is then cooked until most of the water has been evaporated. Olives, capers, corn, and bay leaves are then added and cooked for an <b>additional</b> <b>minute.</b> Rice, black pepper, {{coriander}} seeds, cumin, and possibly orégano brujo are then added and stirred until every grain of rice is coated with sofrito. Broth is then poured into the pot and left to cook. This dish popular on Thanksgiving.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the opening}} of the school, {{district}} officials contemplated expanding the school. A week {{before the end of the}} first semester in 2006, the school opened a new wing adjacent to the mathematics hall that houses English teachers. The original plan for this wing was for it to be the Freshman Academy, where all freshmen would attend class. However the plan was not used. PMHS also built a new field house exclusively for its football program right off the south parking lot. Recently, outdoor portable buildings, converted to classrooms, have been provided for overflow as the number of students has exceeded the school's capacity. Students are allotted one <b>additional</b> <b>minute</b> to reach these facilities, which was decreased from the original travel time of two minutes. A student petition was created that had more than five hundred signatures against the time decrease, but the administration denied the students appeal for an <b>additional</b> <b>minute</b> to travel to portable classes claiming that students should [...] "walk faster" [...] as quoted by Assistant Principal Kevin Blain. Plus an addition of security cameras were added in the hallways, cafeteria, and outside of building, along with police officers to ensure more safety due to a survey taken by parents and students whom requested more security. A 2014 bond was introduced to expand the campus by adding an Early College High School (ECHS) wing to PMHS. It was proprosed to help with the overcrowdedness since the school was originally only made to hold 2,000 students. The estimated cost of the project is $5,800,000 but a date for construction has not been set yet.|$|E

Initially they even provided 5 or 10 free calls to new users.|$|E
50|$|The derby {{turned out}} to be a classic, with City's Craig Bellamy and United's Darren Fletcher playing main roles. Wayne Rooney gave United first blood after just a bit more than one minute, but Gareth Barry was able to equalise after a quarter of an hour. Midfielder Fletcher then entered the frame, scoring on 49 minutes. A quick {{equaliser}} from Bellamy made sure the scores were levelled after 52 minutes. With ten minutes remaining, Fletcher made it 3-2. The game was far from won for United, however, since Bellamy scored a dramatic equaliser on 90 minutes. However, lots of time was added on, and in the sixth <b>additional</b> <b>minute,</b> substitute Michael Owen struck 4-3 from close range to cap a remarkable derby.|$|E

5000|$|On the American Sony/Columbia {{pressing}} of the album, [...] "Very Sleepy Rivers" [...] {{is divided}} amongst tracks 8 through 98. Track 8 contains the first 7:15, {{while the rest}} of the song is split amongst the following 90 4-second tracks, netting the song an <b>additional</b> <b>minute</b> in the process. The audio slowly fades out around track 83 and, around track 88, someone starts saying 'pick' repeatedly with some barely audible laughter. During this quieter section, a low-level sub-bass signal (under 20 Hz) was mixed underneath, which reportedly caused damage to some equipment at Sony's mastering studio. The unusual method of splitting the track was included in Pitchfork Media's 2010 list of [...] "ten unusual CD-era gimmicks".
