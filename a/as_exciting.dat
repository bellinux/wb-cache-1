5|$|Several {{critics and}} {{publications}} ranked Coexist {{as one of}} 2012's best albums in their year-end, top-ten lists, including Kitty Empire of The Observer, The Austin Chronicle, Les Inrockuptibles, State magazine, and The Guardian, whose staff voted it eighth. It was named the 14th best {{album of the year}} by both NME magazine and Christgau in his list for The Barnes & Noble Review. However, the magazine XLR8R ranked the album number seven on their list of the most overrated releases of the year, feeling that the trio's dark and minimal sound on the record was not <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> as on their debut LP.|$|E
5|$|After impressing {{with the}} {{reserves}} in 2001, Hall {{was drafted by}} Essendon with the 46th selection in the 2002 AFL Rookie Draft, thereby placing him on the Bombers' rookie list. Speaking to The Mercury, Hall described the opportunity <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> said that {{it has always been}} his dream to play in the AFL. In the lead-up to the 2002 season Hall played in all three of Essendon's pre-season matches, of which the Bombers lost every game. Rookie listed players must be promoted to the senior list before they play a senior AFL match, so Hall began the 2002 season playing in the VFL for Essendon's reserves team.|$|E
5|$|The Michiganensian {{described}} the defeat as follows:"There had been {{every reason to}} expect a victory from Chicago. Michigan had played strong and consistent foot ball throughout her schedule – Chicago had been erratic and unsteady. But there is certainly no sport more full of surprises than foot-ball, and the Thanksgiving Day contest of '96 furnished as sensational a surprise in <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> a contest as had ever come off on a western gridiron. There was one great difference {{in the character of}} the play of the two teams. Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game she could have been depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game. There could have been little doubt what the result of a series of contests would have been. But this one game, Chicago won by good generalship, by the most advantageous use of her greatest resource – a magnificent player in a telling place.|$|E

5|$|Liz {{attempts}} to make amends by talking to Tracy during a rehearsal, during which she makes negative remarks about Jenna {{and the other members}} of her staff. Liz is notified by Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) that her chat with Tracy was aired over the studio's monitors, which meant that everyone heard and saw her making the comments. Liz's staff show their displeasure by throwing food and other objects at her. Liz and Tracy discuss an idea to get everyone together to try and smooth things over, and Tracy decides to invite Liz and the staff to a party aboard a yacht. Tracy gets along well with everyone at the party, including Jenna, and things appear to be going very well. Liz soon discovers that the yacht does not belong to Tracy, and the yacht's real owner shows up with the NYPD. The following day Liz learns that Jack paid the newspapers to keep Tracy out of the press but left a photo of Jenna passing out on the yacht in their pages, which Jenna sees <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> and flattering.|$|E

25|$|The Lakers {{did not win}} another {{championship}} until 2000, {{which began}} a streak of three consecutive titles led by stars Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. However, the team's style under coach Phil Jackson's triangle offense was not <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> or graceful, generally grinding down opponents behind O'Neal's strength. Rudy Tomjanovich was hired in 2004 to install an up-tempo offense and revive the high-scoring of the 1980s teams. He was not successful, and the Lakers reverted to the triangle offense as Jackson returned. Under Jackson's guidance, the Lakers were NBA champions again in 2009 and 2010.|$|E

25|$|The Dynamo {{then had}} to face New York Red Bulls who had bested them {{during the regular season}} in all three meetings, and it looked like they would thrash the Dynamo in the playoffs as well after the Red Bulls jumped out to a 2–0 lead during the first leg in Houston. Ricardo Clark was able to get on the board at the 50', and Omar Cummings, {{recently}} returned to full form, scored in stoppage time to complete the Dynamo exciting comeback. The 2nd leg in New York proved to be just <b>as</b> <b>exciting.</b> Bradley Wright-Phillips put the Red Bulls in the series lead again in the 23', but Brad Davis punished a mistake from the Red Bull defense to level the score before the half. Enter Omar Cummings for a second time, and for a second time, he scored a thrilling stoppage time goal to put the Houston Dynamo into the Conference Championship for the 3rd consecutive year.|$|E

500|$|The setlist {{received}} a lukewarm reception. Game Informer stated that, {{compared to the}} setlists for other Guitar Hero games, the songs [...] "skew away from great guitar rock and into the territory of pop/rock", and [...] "just aren't <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> to play". IGN commented that the setlist was [...] "a little debatable" [...] and [...] "clearly being aimed at a friendlier, mainstream, pop-friendly crowd".|$|E
500|$|Clinton Lawrence {{described}} the last Sector General book, Double Contact (1999), as [...] "in {{a very positive}} way, a throwback to an earlier era in science fiction" [...] since it is optimistic and depicts several advanced species working harmoniously. The struggle to build trust and produce a successful first contact is, he thought, <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> and suspenseful as one could wish for. However {{he noted that the}} level of characterization was the minimum required to support the plot.|$|E
500|$|Critics have praised Williams' score, {{comparing}} it favorably to the original. Williams [...] "uses {{a few basic}} elements of the original—the obligatory shark motif, for one—and takes the music off in some new and interesting directions." [...] The score is [...] "more disturbing in places" [...] than the original, and [...] "Williams [...] some new and hugely memorable out to sea adventure music." [...] Because Jaws 2 [...] "isn't a film that requires subtlety ... Williams pulls {{out all the stops}} to make it <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> and hair raising as possible." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for The New York Times, Anthony Boucher {{wrote that}} the book belongs [...] "pretty much to the private-eye school" [...] of fiction. He praised the first part, saying that Fleming [...] "manages to make baccarat clear even to one who's never played it and {{produced}} <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> a gambling sequence as I've ever read. But then he decides to pad out the book to novel length and leads the weary reader {{through a set of}} tough clichés to an ending which surprises nobody save Operative 007. You should certainly begin this book; but you might as well stop when the baccarat game is over." ...|$|E

Honma, Ebihara and Hoffman thought the character visuals retained their image and comical aspects from the 2D games, something Honma called [...] "incredible". Vore said that the new 3D environments made the crime scenes feel like real places rather than [...] "interactive paintings". Aerox called the 3D animation beautiful, and liked the cutscenes and soundtrack.|$|E

Connelly noted that in the [...] "hyperactive" [...] song, Jackson's [...] "emotions are so raw that the song nearly goes out of control". He further commented that the song has a [...] "tune that's almost <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> as seeing Jackson motivate himself across a concert stage – {{and a lot more}} unpredictable". Remarking that while the song's lyrics [...] "won't keep Elvis Costello awake nights [...] ", they [...] "do show that Jackson has progressed past the hey-let's-hustle sentiments that dominated Off the Wall". He added that Jackson's [...] "raw ability and conviction make material like", citing [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin", as well as other of Thrillers songs, [...] "into first-class cuts".|$|E
