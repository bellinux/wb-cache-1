5|$|Before {{heading out}} to a {{baseball}} game at a nearby ballpark, sports fan Mr. Brown drinks several highball cocktails. He arrives <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> to watch the game, but has become so inebriated that the game appears to him in reverse, with the players running the bases backwards and the baseball flying back into the pitcher's hand. After the game is over, Mr. Brown is escorted home {{by one of his}} friends. When they arrive at Brown's house, they encounter his wife who becomes furious with the friend and proceeds to physically assault him, believing he is responsible for her husband's severe intoxication.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the family}} have all {{begun to take}} extra jobs to pay for Chris's tuition; Peter sells butt scratchers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark,</b> Lois and Meg begin working as prostitutes, and Stewie decides to follow {{overweight}} park-goers, while playing the tuba, making them fall. As this is happening, Chris starts to feel uncomfortable with his membership at the Skull and Bones, especially after one of their activities involves teasing an orphan they had pretended to adopt. Feeling his family should not go through so much trouble to keep him satisfied, Chris asks Carter {{to help him get}} back into his old school. Carter complies with his request, and Chris moves back home, and returns to James Woods High School. At the end of the episode, Stewie plays the tuba for Chris, making him fall.|$|E

2500|$|An {{independent}} {{study by the}} weather service provider AccuWeather in June 2009 concluded that the shape and height of the right field wall, rather than the wind, {{is responsible for the}} proliferation of home runs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stadium. [...] AccuWeather's analysis found that roughly 20% of the home runs hit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> new <b>ballpark</b> would not have been home runs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old <b>ballpark</b> due to <b>the</b> gentle curve of its right field corner, and its [...] wall height. [...] Nothing was observed in wind speeds and patterns that would account for the increase.|$|R
50|$|With {{some extra}} bleachers in {{left and right}} fields, the sellout {{attendance}} of 54,251 set a record for the largest crowd for a sporting event <b>at</b> <b>the</b> two-year-old <b>ballpark.</b>|$|R

25|$|Veterans Stadium was {{host to the}} latest-finishing game in {{baseball}} history, a twi-night double-header between the Phillies and the Padres that started on July 2, 1993, at 5:05 PM and ended at 4:40 AM the following morning. The two games were interrupted multiple times by rain showers. The Padres won the first game, and led in the second, but lost in a come-from-behind victory for the Phillies in the tenth inning on an RBI single by Phillies closing pitcher Mitch Williams. The second game ended with an estimated 6,000 fans <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Even <b>at</b> that, <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> {{was planned}} {{to be only a}} {{temporary}} site, to be replaced by an 8 million USD stadium owned by the Fort Worth Sports Authority; however that plan never materialized, due to soil contamination and water pollution <b>at</b> <b>the</b> city-owned site ...|$|R

25|$|Playing at Camden Yards, the Yankees {{lost the}} first two games of the season due to poor {{performances}} by starters CC Sabathia and Chien-Ming Wang, though they rebounded to take the third game of the series as well as win the next two series they played against the Kansas City Royals and defending AL East Champions Tampa Bay Rays. On April 16, the Yankees played the first game in their new Yankee Stadium, but they lost the game because of a shaky bullpen. They won the next game to split their first series <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark.</b> The Yankees were swept later in the month by the rival Boston Red Sox in three games at Fenway Park.|$|E
25|$|For 2017, the Nationals {{moved to}} a new spring {{training}} facility <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Ballpark</b> of the Palm Beaches, in West Palm Beach, Florida, which they share with the Houston Astros. Projected to cost US$135 million, the construction of the ballpark and training facilities actually cost US$150 million. The new facility provided each team with two major-league-size practice fields, four-minor-league-size practice fields, an agility field, a half field, batting cages, and pitching mounds, and centered around a new baseball stadium with 6,400 ticketed seats and 1,250 berm seats. The move from their former spring training home, Space Coast Stadium in Viera, Florida, placed the Nationals far closer to other teams during spring training, facilitating travel for spring training games.|$|E
25|$|The Americans played {{another season}} in 1886, but {{dropped out of}} the league after the season. They would be {{followed}} by the Nashville Blues (1887), Nashville Tigers (1893–94), Nashville Seraphs (1895), and Nashville Centennials (1897) as 19th century tenants of Athletic Park. The bleachers along the third base line were replaced by seats in 1897. In 1901, the newly formed Southern Association's Nashville Vols began playing their home games <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark.</b> The capacity was expanded to 2,500, with 1,000 seats in the grandstand, before the Vols' first season. The semi-pro Negro league Nashville Elite Giants, a forerunner to the Nashville Standard/Elite Giants, started playing games at Athletic Park as early as 1907. The team remained at the park through 1928 when Tom Wilson Park was built for the team by their owner.|$|E
50|$|The Frontier League Sliders' {{became the}} Midwest Sliders of Ypsilanti for the 2009 season. That year they played at Eastern Michigan University's Oestrike Stadium located in Ypsilanti, Michigan. In 2010, {{the team was}} renamed the Oakland County Cruisers, and moved into <b>the</b> new Diamond <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Summit <b>ballpark.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ballpark</b> {{is a part of}} the Summit Place Mall complex.|$|R

25|$|This {{left the}} team {{in a state of}} disarray with the {{consensus}} view that the team should be disbanded. At that point, Radbourn offered to start every game {{for the rest of the}} season (having pitched in 76 of 98 games the season before) in exchange for a small raise and exemption from the reserve clause for the next season. From that point, July 23 to September 24 when the pennant was clinched, Providence played 43 games and Radbourn started 40 of them and won 36. Soon, pitching every other day as he was, his arm became so sore he couldn't raise it to comb his hair. On game day he was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> hours before the start, getting warmed up. He began his warm up by throwing just a few feet, increasing the distance gradually until he was pitching from second base and finally from short centerfield.|$|E
25|$|During the 2016-2017 offseason, the Nationals {{announced}} that Racing Presidents Calvin Coolidge ("Cal"), Herbert Hoover ("Herbie"), and William Howard Taft ("Bill") had retired permanently to Florida, {{where they would}} compete against one another in races held during the fourth inning of Nationals spring training games <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Ballpark</b> of the Palm Beaches in West Palm Beach. Taft had raced at Nationals Park from 2013 through 2016, while the other two retired presidents had raced there for one season each – Coolidge in 2015 and Hoover in 2016 – {{as part of a}} multiyear marketing partnership between the Nationals and the White House Historical Association. As a result of Taft′s retirement and the Nationals′ decision not to add Franklin Delano Roosevelt as a Racing President in 2017, the Presidents Race at Nationals Park reverted in 2017 to its original format of 2006 through 2012, with competition between only four presidents: George Washington ("George"), Thomas Jefferson ("Tom"), Abraham Lincoln ("Abe"), and Theodore Roosevelt ("Teddy").|$|E
25|$|Target Field {{was built}} in what was a {{parking lot at the}} north end of {{downtown}} Minneapolis within walking distance of the Target Center. On September 15, 2008 the Twins announced that they had sold naming rights to the Target Corporation and that the stadium would be known as Target Field. The Metro Light Rail was extended to the ballpark area with a connection to the Northstar Commuter Rail, which terminates <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark.</b> Preliminary plans called for a seating capacity of 40,000 seats and 72 suites. There are approximately 34 rest rooms compared to only 16 in Metrodome. The concourses are open to the playing field with a view of the downtown Minneapolis skyline from every seat in the park. There is no retractable roof on the stadium which would have added about $200 million on to the cost which was $522 million. This received some objection due to the potentially harsh game conditions in early April (similar to other northern pro baseball teams such as the White Sox, Cubs, Tigers, Indians, Red Sox, etc.) and the potential risk of resulting lost revenue. The official groundbreaking for the stadium, originally scheduled for 2 August 2007, was postponed to August 30 due to the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge.|$|E
50|$|The Goodyear Centennials, of the Freedom Pro Baseball League, {{play their}} home games <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Goodyear <b>Ballpark.</b> Two other {{baseball}} {{teams in the}} Arizona League, the Arizona League Indians and the Arizona League Reds, also play <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stadium.|$|R
50|$|The 2001-02 International Baseball League of Australia {{was played}} {{exclusively}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Melbourne <b>Ballpark.</b> <b>The</b> championship reverted to its 1999-2000 format using 6 state teams, however New South Wales Country {{was replaced by}} an Australian Provincial Team {{with a mix of}} players from the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.|$|R
5000|$|The {{team would}} have played <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bergen <b>Ballpark,</b> located on <b>the</b> {{site of the}} Xanadu Meadowlands project. The name [...] "Cliff Hawks" [...] refers to the raptors that inhabit the cliffs of the New Jersey Palisades which stretch through Bergen County.|$|R
