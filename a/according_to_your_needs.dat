This activity is meant to be used for audio clips of the OpenLIVES collection and interview transcripts, but can also be used with any other oral history podcasts/transcripts. One of the main features of the activity is that it introduces students to audience differentiation and student cultural production. The other key feature is that the activity introduces learning reflection, hence raising awareness on life skills. That way the activity can provide students with a research-based experience that connects them to the world of work and life in general. There is also a strong focus on team work. The activity contemplates the possibility of students publishing, in accordance with their own institution protocols, the work as a OER.

40|$|One recent {{debate that}} beautifully {{illustrates}} {{the authority of}} science is that between creationists and those in favour of teaching evolutionary theory. Despite continuous creationist claims to the contrary, there exists no controversy {{in the scientific community}} over evolutionary theory; the debate takes place entirely within the public domain. Because of the authority science is credited with within public space, each camp is careful to present its own position as genuinely scientific, and equally intends to portray its opponent’s position as unscientific claptrap. On the one hand, creationists point out the alleged gaps in evolutionary theory to support the claim that evolution is ‘just a theory’, amounting to nothing more than naturalistic philosophy or a godless religion. Evolutionists, on the other hand, intend to demonstrate that creationists have only religion and not science on their mind, and that their scientific pretentions are absurd to the highest degree. The evidence, they explain, does not support a world-wide flood nor the intervention of an intelligent designer. Apart from presenting real or supposed countervailing evidence, both camps often resort to yet another strategy to undermine each other’s position. They put forth a definition of science and proceed to argue that the ideas of their respective opponent fail to meet the criteria set by that definition, and thus lack {{what it takes to be}} called a science. It is on this tactic we will focus our attention here, and this for two reasons. First, by these definitions of science, the authority of the term ‘science’ is invoked directly, without relying on those methods and properties science itself owes its authority to. Instead, in this public setting, science becomes a rhetorical device, a term you can define <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>needs.</b> Second, philosophers of science have been deeply involved in this debate. Some of them (e. g. Karl Popper) merely unintentionally, because at least one of the camps seized upon their definition of science. Others have been more actively engaged and proposed definitions by which creationism could be deemed unscientific. Both efforts have the unfortunate effect of giving the false impression that there exists a philosophical consensus on the definition of science or on the demarcation of science from religion or pseudoscience. Also, both bring yet another authority in play, that of philosophy (or the philosopher) of science, that, in this particular case, somehow derives its authority from science, but, again, does not result from the methods or properties the authority of science itself is based on. When philosophers act as experts in the debate, they reinforce both effects considerably. We discern several disadvantages in the latter approach and we suggest that in this debate, by any available means (e. g. education, popular science, [...] .), science should speak for itself so that its authority can be understood and rightly assigned; simply invoking science as a rhetorical device tends to counteract its authority...|$|E
40|$|Enhanced API for rOpensci traits package; {{upgrade to}} rails 3. 2, Ruby 2. 1. 5. This release {{upgrades}} the Rails version from Rails 3. 0. 18 to Rails 3. 2. 21 and changes the RVM-specified version of Ruby from version 1. 9. 3 -p 429 to version 2. 1. 5. In {{addition to these}} changes which {{in and of themselves}} make for improved security, there are numerous minor changes to the Rails code including security fixes, removal of obsolete code, fixes and improvements to the query API, and phase-out of vendor plugins in favor of gems, Changes Pertinent to PEcAn Users Administrators need to do a database migration. See "Database Changes" below. Summary of Changes New Features Enhanced API for rOpensci traits package See section 2 of the BETYdb Data Access guide at [URL] API Key generation Users may now generate their own API keys by going to the Users page and clicking the "key" button. And there is now a new rake task that administrators can use to generate API keys for all current users. See section 2. 3 of the BETYdb Data Access guide at [URL] Directory-Specific Session Keys When multiple copies of BETYdb are deployed on the same host, they now use differently-named session cookies (assuming the basenames of the Rails root directories are different). This mainly affects developers who may visit different copies of BETYdb on the same host simultaneously; up to now, such users will likely have seen baffling interactions between the two copies. Updated version of selenium-webdriver The Gem version specification for selenium-webdriver has been changed to a version compatible with the latest versions of Firefox. This mainly affects those running the RSpec tests in debug mode. Addition of primary keys to join tables This facilitate the synchronizing of data having to do with many-to-many associations. Security Updates Miscellaneous security updates have been implemented, including Upgrading of Rails from version 3. 0. 18 to 3. 2. 21 Upgrading the default version of Ruby to version 2. 1. 5 Storage of session data in the database instead of in cookies Elimination of most non-specific routes In keeping with recommended practice in Rails 3. 2, packages that were formerly kept in vendor plugins are now in Ruby gems. The change to database storage of session data has the additional benefit of overcoming some restrictions on the size of bulk uploads. Bug Fixes The API for querying and downloading data offers more features than available previously, restoring some features that were lost in the upgrade from Rails 2 to Rails 3. See section 2 of the Data Access Guide: [URL] Cloning of PFTs now works again. A bug that prevented editing a PFT if it was associated with some Prior whose paramb column was NULL has now been fixed. Steps Needed for Upgrade Database Changes Administrators need to do database migrations! One migration has been added that adds id columns to the join tables. The database version for this release is 20150202215147. Ruby Upgrade The officially-supported version of Ruby for use with BETYdb is now Ruby version 2. 1. 5. It is recommended that you upgrade to some Ruby 2 version since Ruby 1. 9. 3 is no longer being maintained. (See [URL] for details.) Nevertheless, users who can not or do not wish to upgrade will likely be able to continue to use Ruby 1. 9. 3 without difficulty. It may also be possible to use the latest version of Ruby, Ruby 2. 2. 1. To continue using Ruby 1. 9. 3 If you use RVM or some other Ruby version management system that reads the. ruby-version file, revert the string in that file so that it once again reads ruby- 1. 9. 3 -p 429. You may wish to add. ruby-version to your. gitignore file so that git doesn't try to change it or flag it as having been modified. To upgrade to Ruby 2. 1. 5 Install Ruby 2. 1. 5 if you haven't done so already. If you use RVM, you may do this by running rvm install 2. 1. 5 If you run BETYdb with Apache [URL] change or add the directive PassengerDefaultRuby /path/to/ruby 2 /executable or the PassengerRuby /path/to/ruby 2 /executable directive <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>needs.</b> Otherwise, if you only use WEBrick, just ensure that the version of Ruby you want to use is first in your path. If you are using RVM, this is automatic (though you may have to leave and then return to the BETYdb Rails root directory if you haven't done so since updating your. ruby-version file; run rvm current to verify that you are using the correct Ruby version and gemset). Gem Installation, Including Rails Upgrade Administrators need to run the bundler to install several new Ruby Gems and updated versions of existing ones. First, change to the root directory of your BETYdb Rails installation. Then, if you are using RVM, run rvm current to ensure you are using the correct Ruby version and gemset. It should say ruby- 2. 1. 5 @betydb_rails 3 if you upgraded Ruby and ruby- 1. 9. 3 -p 429 @betydb_rails 3 if you did not. If you are not using a Ruby version management system, simply run ruby -v to check your version of Ruby. Once you ensure you are using the correct Ruby version and gemset, run bundle If you have trouble installing capybara-webkit and don't need to run the Javascript-based RSpec tests, you may run bundle [...] without javascript_testing instead. If you won't be running RSpec tests at all and want to minimize your Gem installation, run bundle [...] without javascript_testing test debug See [URL] for details. Status of RSpec Tests All tests continue to pass when run in the default environment and can be run using the command bundle exec rspec Complete details for running the rspec tests are on the updated Wiki page at [URL]...|$|E
