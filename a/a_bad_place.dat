Jade meets Callum and realises that he is Sonya's son, that she left with their grandmother. Callum tries to find his mother. After an accident, Callum is rushed to {{hospital}} and he realises that Sonya is his mother. Sonya confirms it and a devastated Toadie asks her to leave.

25|$|The {{population}} of Nuristan is ethnically {{distinct from the}} rest of Afghanistan, and divided into four major groups, the Kom, Kata, Kushtoz, and Kalasha. These subgroups were in turn divided into different clans and sects of the Islamic religion, depending on lineages and the interpretations of individual religious leaders. These groups could clash violently over water rights, pasture, and religious beliefs. Five different languages and various dialects are spoken by these groups, making translators from other areas of Afghanistan useless. The Soviets had to contend with a rebel group known as the Dawlet of eastern Nuristan. They were professing a Salafi version of Islam, and hostile to any political rivals. The Nuristanis had resisted Islam as late as the year 1895 and before that had been considered a nation of infidels with a long tradition of violently resisting outsiders, their beliefs, and their invasions. Resistance in Nuristan revolved around a specific group of Islamic fighters known as Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin or HIG. During the Soviet occupation HIG received more support from the CIA than any other Mujahideen resistance group. When it came to infiltration from Pakistan, and setting up ambushes, HIG was regarded as the most skillful. In 2006 HIG was actively resisting the Afghan government. When Captain Aaron Swain of Cherokee Co. had sounded out Afghan Border Police Commander Ahmed Shah about setting up near Kamdesh, he was told that HIG insurgents tried to blow up Shah’s jeep on his last trip there and it was <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
500|$|Burton {{explained}} that his depiction of suburbia is [...] "not <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>place.</b> It's a weird place. I {{tried to walk}} the fine line of making it funny and strange without it being judgmental. It's a place where there's a lot of integrity." [...] Kim leaves her jock boyfriend (Jim) to be with Edward, an event that many have postulated as Burton's revenge against jocks he encountered {{as a teenager in}} suburban Burbank, CA. Jim is subsequently killed, a scene that shocked a number of observers who felt the whole tone of the film had been radically altered. Burton referred to this scene as a [...] "high school fantasy".|$|E

500|$|Nino, a key villain, {{is portrayed}} by Ron Perlman, {{one of the}} last actors to join the cast. Regarding the casting of Perlman, Refn said, [...] "The {{character}} of Nino was originally not particularly interesting, so I asked Ron why he wanted to be in my movie when he's done so many great films. When Perlman said, 'I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster', and I asked why, and he said, 'because that's what I am – a Jewish boy from New York', well, that automatically cemented it for me." [...] Oscar Isaac portrays a Latino convict named Standard, who is married to Irene and is just released from prison a week after Irene meets The Driver. He found the role to be a bit unappealing and chose to turn the archetypal character into something more. He said of the role: As soon as I sat down with Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>place.</b> By making 'Standard' more specific and more interesting, we found that it made the story that more compelling.|$|E
2500|$|William James' {{views were}} ambivalent. While he {{believed}} in free will on [...] "ethical grounds", {{he did not believe}} that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it, he did believe that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work Pragmatism, he wrote that [...] "instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise" [...] regardless of metaphysical theories. He did believe that indeterminism is important as a [...] "doctrine of relief" [...] – it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>place,</b> it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines meliorism – the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.|$|E

Alan Neilson again took charge of Luton's game that evening against Braintree Town, which they lost 2-0 to fall to tenth position in the table and 14 points off of the play-offs. Neilson apologised for the team's poor performance, stating [...] "we're all in <b>a</b> real <b>bad</b> <b>place,</b> the players and myself".|$|R

Hazel effectively repudiates her nihilism and materialism as she responds across the barrier of death to Gus’s 'okay'."
