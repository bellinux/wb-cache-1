5|$|Other poems may be {{organized}} into verse paragraphs, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used, but the poetic tone is instead established by {{a collection of}} rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form. Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs, even where regular rhymes <b>and</b> <b>rhythms</b> were used.|$|E

5|$|The poem is a lyrical {{description}} {{of the life of}} a tribe he was living with along the Amazon river. While it has echoes of Tennyson in the rhymes <b>and</b> <b>rhythms</b> the poem itself is not overly Romantic, serving more as a tool to set the scene and then draw contrast between {{the lives of the people}} living here and those in England. The poem is a comment on savagery and greed, making the point that some in England were more 'savage' than those on the Amazon, either by a greed for gold or by their greed for gold driving others into poverty.|$|E

5|$|London has {{numerous}} venues for {{rock and}} pop concerts, including the world's busiest arena the O2 arena {{and other large}} arenas such as Earls Court, Wembley Arena, {{as well as many}} mid-sized venues, such as Brixton Academy, the Hammersmith Apollo and the Shepherd's Bush Empire. Several music festivals, including the Wireless Festival, South West Four, Lovebox, and Hyde Park's British Summer Time are all held in London. The city is home to the original Hard Rock Cafe and the Abbey Road Studios, where The Beatles recorded many of their hits. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, musicians and groups like Elton John, Pink Floyd, Cliff Richard, David Bowie, Queen, The Kinks, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin, The Small Faces, Iron Maiden, Fleetwood Mac, Elvis Costello, Cat Stevens, The Police, The Cure, Madness, The Jam, Ultravox, Spandau Ballet, Culture Club, Dusty Springfield, Phil Collins, Rod Stewart, Adam Ant, Status Quo and Sade, derived their sound from the streets <b>and</b> <b>rhythms</b> of London.|$|E
5|$|The {{contrasting}} {{geography of}} Northern England is reflected its literature. On the one hand, the wild moors and lakes have inspired generations of Romantic authors: {{the poetry of}} William Wordsworth and the novels of the Brontë sisters {{are perhaps the most}} famous examples of writing inspired by these elemental forces. Classics of children's literature such as The Railway Children (1906), The Secret Garden (1911) and Swallows and Amazons (1930) portray these largely untouched landscapes as worlds of adventure and transformation where their protagonists can break free of the restrictions of society. Modern poets such as the former Poet Laureate Ted Hughes and Oxford Professor of Poetry Simon Armitage have found inspiration in the Northern countryside, producing works that take advantage of the sounds <b>and</b> <b>rhythms</b> of Northern English dialects.|$|E
5|$|In late 1984 Chrisye {{approached}} {{another young}} composer, Adjie Soetama, {{to help him}} prepare his next album. Light beats and cheerful melodies were in vogue at the time; therefore the two used a lighter style. Recording for the new album, titled Aku Cinta Dia (I Love Her), began in 1985, with additional songs from Guruh and Dadang S. Manaf. The titular song was chosen after Aciu heard a jam session led by Adjie and immediately decided {{that it would be}} the lead single. The album called for more emoting, which Chrisye– known as having a stiff stage persona– struggled to deliver, though Yanti prepared colourful costumes and Alex Hasyim trained him in choreography. Upon its release, Aku Cinta Dia sold hundreds of thousands of copies in the first week and was eventually certified gold. That same year, Chrisye and Adji Soetama released Hip Hip Hura (Hip Hip Hurray!), and another collaboration, Nona Lisa (Miss Lisa), was released in 1986; the later two albums had similar beats <b>and</b> <b>rhythms</b> and sold well, although not as well as Aku Cinta Dia. On 2 March 1986 Chrisye and Yanti had their second daughter, Risty Nurraisa.|$|E
