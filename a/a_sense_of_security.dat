Israel's victory in the Six Day War brought about <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> within Israel; the occupied territory added strategic depth to the country's defense. Consequently, Israel and Egypt ignored United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 242, which called for withdrawal from occupied territories in return for Arab recognition, and negotiations between the countries ceased. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir aimed {{to maintain the status quo}} and believed that her country's military strength would secure peace with Arab nations on their terms. Egypt, on the other hand, refused to recognize Israel or even negotiate with directly, preferring talks via third parties.|$|E

25|$|It was {{impossible}} that Meleager and Perdiccas should long continue on friendly terms, and Meleager proved {{no match for}} Perdiccas. Perdiccas contrived to lull his rival into <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> while he made himself master of Philip Arrhidaeus. Then he struck the first blow. The whole army was assembled under the pretence of a general review. Then the king, at the instigation of Perdiccas, suddenly demanded the surrender and punishment of all {{the leaders of the}} recent disorders. The infantry were taken by surprise, with 300 of the alleged mutineers being singled out and executed. Although Meleager was not personally attacked, he fled and took refuge in a temple, where he was pursued and put to death on the orders of Perdiccas.|$|E

Eisner called this a [...] "fatal" [...] continuity error, but John D. Barlow disagrees, arguing {{it is a common}} characteristic for dream narratives to have some normal elements in them, and that the normalcy of Jane's house in particular could represent the feeling of comfort and refuge Francis feels in her presence. Mike Budd argues while the Expressionistic visual style is jarring and off-putting at first, the characters start to blend more harmoniously as the film progresses, and the setting becomes more relegated into the background.|$|E
500|$|By 1980, 75% of the {{residents}} in Singapore were living in public housing. [...] Government-built high-rise blocks of flats clustered in the population centres, of which Toa Payoh was typical. [...] Although a high density of people lived in each block, {{the residents}} mostly kept to themselves, valuing their privacy and tending to ignore what was happening around their homes.

500|$|When the {{election}} came in August 1935, Aberhart offered economic recovery while Reid offered criticisms of Aberhart. Highlighting the UFA's record of clean government, low taxes, and fiscal responsibility, Reid committed {{himself and his}} government to bringing <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> More tangibly, he promised to build a government oil refinery (predicting that [...] "the near future will witness the greatest explorations for oil which this province has ever known"). Most of the campaign was conducted around Social Credit's promise to pull the province out of depression with its monetary theories. Reid alleged that Aberhart's policies would destroy the province's credit and leave it unable to borrow the money it needed to carry on, but voters—even those sceptical of Social Credit's promises—saw no alternative hopes offered by the UFA. On 11 August, election day, every UFA MLA was defeated; Reid himself finished third in his riding, barely ahead of the Communist candidate, and resigned as Premier effective 22 August.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{his return}} from Afghanistan, Dutton wrote an article for The Guardian newspaper, in which he opined that the NATO-led forces in the country were making a {{difference}} and the situation was improving, but that the Afghan government still required assistance. He argued that more troops did not necessarily mean more violence, saying that [...] "experience shows that after an initial spike as the insurgents are cleared out, violence reduces to much lower levels" [...] and that [...] "providing <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> depends on much more than physical troop presence, {{but it has to}} start with that. We need sufficient troops to protect the people and convince them that Afghan government control (supported by [...] for the moment) is sufficient to prevent the return of the insurgents. He {{went on to say that}} [...] "the backbone of the NATO alliance gives the coalition a steadfastness which [...] "coalitions of the willing" [...] cannot match. It also gives unparalleled authority and legitimacy based on the consensus of its members". Dutton concluded that [...] "given the strength of this unparalleled military coalition, and the political and financial commitment to building the long-term stability of Afghanistan and the region, failure should not be contemplated". He was awarded the American Legion of Merit (Degree of Officer), and given permission to wear the decoration, [...] "in recognition of meritorious, gallant and distinguished services during coalition operations in Afghanistan".|$|E
500|$|With {{the end of}} World War I, the Australian Government {{began to}} worry about the threat Japan posed to Australia. Japan had {{extended}} its empire [...] to the south, bringing it right to Australia's doorstep. Japan had continued to build up its naval force, and had reached the point where it outgunned the Royal Navy in the Pacific. The RAN and the government believed that the possibility of a Japanese invasion was highly likely. In his report, Admiral Jellicoe believed that the threat of a Japanese invasion of Australia would remain as long as the White Australia Policy remained in place. Due to the perceived threat, and bilateral support in Australia for the White Australia Policy, the Australian Government became a vocal supporter of the continuance of the 1902 Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Australia was joined in its support for the alliance by New Zealand but was heavily opposed by Canada, which believed that the alliance had hindered the British Empire's relationship with China and the United States. No decision on the alliance was agreed on, and the discussion was shelved pending the outcome of the Washington Naval Treaty. The results of the treaty, which allowed the British to retain naval supremacy in the Pacific Ocean, created <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> in Australia. Many Australians saw the Four Powers Pact as replacing the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. This sense of security became known as the Ten Year Rule. This led to defence retrenchments in Australia, following the international trend, and a £500,000 reduction in expenditure. The Governor-General Henry Forster when opening parliament on 22 June 1922 was quoted as saying: ...|$|E

ISIL has utilized sexual violence in order to undermine <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> within communities, as well as to raise funds through the sale of captives into sexual slavery. According to The Wall Street Journal, ISIL appeals to apocalyptic beliefs and claims [...] "justification by a Hadith that they interpret as portraying the revival of slavery as a precursor {{to the end of the}} world". In late 2014, ISIL released a pamphlet on the treatment of female slaves. The New York Times said in August 2015 that [...] "he systematic rape of women and girls from the Yazidi religious minority has become deeply enmeshed in the organization and the radical theology of the Islamic State in the year since the group announced it was reviving slavery as an institution." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, {{problems}} {{with the emphasis on}} attachment as a trait (a stable characteristic of an individual) rather than as a type of behaviour with important organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to consider that [...] "attachment (as implying anything but infant-adult interaction) [...] outlived its usefulness as a developmental construct..." [...] and that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life. Children may achieve a given function, such as <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> in many different ways and the various but functionally comparable behaviours should be categorized as related to each other. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept (the organisation of exploration of an unfamiliar situation around returns to a familiar person) as [...] "central to the logic and coherence of attachment theory and to its status as an organizational construct." [...] Similarly, Thompson pointed out that [...] "other features of early parent-child relationships that develop concurrently with attachment security, including negotiating conflict and establishing cooperation, also must be considered in understanding the legacy of early attachments." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 28, 2008, Kuomintang Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung made a {{landmark}} visit to Beijing, and met {{and shook hands}} with the Communist General Secretary Hu Jintao, at the Great Hall of the People. He also visited the mausoleum of Sun Yat-Sen. Hu Jintao called for resuming exchanges and talks, based on the 1992 Consensus, between mainland China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation, as early as possible, and practically solving problems concerning the two sides through talks on equal footing. Once the ARATS-SEF dialogue is resumed, priority {{should be given to}} issues including cross-Strait weekend chartered flights and approval for mainland China residents traveling to Taiwan, which are of the biggest concern to {{people on both sides of}} the Strait.

Wu also told reporters that he had stressed to Hu that Taiwan needed an international presence. [...] "The Taiwanese people need <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> respect and a place in the international community," [...] Wu said.

2500|$|This {{painting}} {{depicts the}} birth of Marie de' Medici's first son, Louis XIII. Rubens designed the scene around the theme of political peace. The birth of the first male heir brings <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> to the royal family that {{they will continue to}} rule. In those times an heir was of the utmost importance, especially if Henry wanted to showcase his masculinity and discontinue with the pattern of the royal reproductive failure. The word dauphin is French for dolphin, a term associated with princely royalty. Henry's promiscuity made difficult the production of a legitimate heir, and rumors circulated to the extent that Henry's court artists began to employ strategies to convince the country otherwise. One of these strategies was to personify Marie as Juno or Minerva. By representing Marie as Juno, implying Henry as Jupiter, the king is seen domesticated by marriage. The queen's personification as Minerva would facilitate Henry's military prowess and her own. As a Flemish painter Rubens includes a dog in the painting, alluding to fidelity in marriage. In addition to the idea of political peace Rubens also includes the personification of Justice, Astraea. The return of Astraea to earth is symbolic of the embodiment of continuing Justice with {{the birth of}} the future king. Louis is nursed by Themis, the goddess of divine order, referring to Louis XIII birthright to one day become king. The baby is quite close to a serpent, which is a representation of Health. [...] Rubens incorporates the traditional allegory of the cornucopia, which symbolizes abundance, to enhance the meaning of the painting by including the heads of Marie de' Medici's children who have yet to be born among the fruit. While Marie gazes adoringly at her son, Fecundity presses the cornucopia to her arm, representing the complete and bountiful family to come.|$|E
