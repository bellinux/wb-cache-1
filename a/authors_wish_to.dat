[...] Their aim {{is to use a}} historical account of the debate over the validity of Boyle's air pump experiments, and by extension his experimental method, to discover the origins of the credibility that we give experimentally produced facts today. [...] The <b>authors</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> avoid [...] "'The self-evident'" [...] method, which (they explain) is when historians project the values of their current culture onto the time period that they are studying (in this case valuing the benefits of empiricism). [...] They wish to take a [...] "stranger's" [...] viewpoint when examining the debate between Hobbes and Boyle because, in the 1660s, both methods of knowledge production were well respected in the academic community and the reasons that Boyle's experimentalism prevailed over Hobbes's natural philosophy would not have been obvious to contemporaries.|$|E

5000|$|This [...] "seven-island kingdom" [...] as some <b>authors</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> call it thus {{identifying}} it {{with the}} Heptanesia of Ptolemy, was not thickly populated. The inhabitants {{with the exception of}} some Mohammedans at Mahim, were mostly Hindus of the Kolis and the Bhandari castes, agriculturists, toddy tappers, gardeners, fishermen. Only after they had established themselves in Bassein and Salsette Island did the Franciscans venture on Bombay-island. In the course of the 16th and the 17th centuries, the Franciscans established several Churches and Chapels in Bombay; among them was the Chapel of O.L. of Good Counsel, Sion. The discord between the Portuguese (the Friars were Portuguese) and the English resulted in the expulsion of the Franciscans from Bombay.|$|E
