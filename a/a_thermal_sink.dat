40|$|Ground source {{heat pump}} (GSHP) is an {{innovative}} and perspective technology {{able to use}} the ground as <b>a</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>sink</b> or heat source. If combined with system operating at relatively low temperature, it represents a high efficiency solution for the heating of buildings. Complementarily, during cooling operation it has a good advantage with respect to air-cooled systems, because the ground temperature is stably lower than the outdoor air one. Geothermal heat pump systems are able to reduce the environmental impact of buildings for space heating and cooling by using the ground as an energy renewable source. This paper presents a review on the GSHP systems presenting both a summary of different ground-source typologies of heat pumps and a thermodynamic approach for their modeling. The irreversible thermodynamic approach is here summarized and exposed for a complete GSHPs system. This analytical approach is particularly useful for implementing an optimization design tool for GSHP systems. Recently many works have been published about exergy analysis of these systems. Those works suggest that future lines of development may be considered: a) the optimization based on the transient performance of GSHP systems and not on the sole design condition; b) the integration of irreversible thermodynamic optimization approach into the algorithms of control systems. The diffusion of optimized GSHP systems is essential in order to reduce fossil fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions, complying with the EU's directive...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{extensive}} {{investigation on}} experimental test of dust minimum explosible concentration (MEC) {{was carried out}} by using the Siwek 20 L vessel. Systematic data were reported on the MEC of various dusts and the influences of ignition energy, dust calorific value, moisture content and particle size were taken into account. It is found that the overly low or high ignition energy will result in unrealistic MEC results. To reliably measure MEC, the experimental tests should be preformed under the condition that the test result is independent of ignition energy. For the Siwek 20 L vessel, the 4 - 6 kJ is the most appropriate energy ranges to determine the MEC of various dusts. The more incombustible component contained in lower calorific value dust acts as <b>a</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>sink</b> in the ignition and heating process of dust cloud, and therefore, the higher MEC {{can be found in the}} MEC measurement of lower calorific value dust. Moreover, due to the notable dust agglomeration, to validly measure MEC, the moisture content of test dust should not exceed 10 wt %. When the moisture content is lower than 10 wt %, the MEC smoothly increases with the rise of moisture content. With the decrease of particle size, the measured MEC becomes lower, and the MEC has an approximate linear relation with particle size. The results reported in this work provide the experimental basis and data guidance for the prevention and evaluation of dust explosion risk...|$|E

Few studies {{have been reported in the}} domain of laser induced solid state phase transitions at-a relative low laser fluence. In this regime the laser pulse acting like a high power heat pulse, the evolution of the system is far from equilibrium and new structures or new mechanism of transformation is expected. In the case of laser thin films heating, the heating rate is of the order of 101 OKs- 1. If the laser pulse is absorbed only in the thin film and the film is laser irradiated while on the substrate, the rate of cooling can be equally fast, the cold substrate acting as <b>a</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>sink.</b> The thin film is suddenly heated and rapidly cooled, quenching the structure resulting after the laser pulse heating. In a previous paper 1 the microstructural aspects of the b. c. c. -f. c. c. phase transition of iron thin films were studied by high resolution transmission electron microscopy. This transition of iron is one of the best known and studied allotropic transformation, mainly in the case of martensitic transformation 2.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the Nighttime Solar Cell ™ is to produce electric power at night. The cell {{can be used to}} complement daytime photovoltaic electrical energy production, or as a stand-alone device can produce electrical power both night and day in low-wattage applications. The Nighttime Solar Cell ™ op-erates with a thermoelectric generator (TEG) utilizing the ambient or its surroundings as the source of thermal energy while deep space provides <b>a</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>sink.</b> The cold junctions of the TEG are insulated from the surroundings with a vacuum to improve overall effec-tiveness. The Cold Junction Plate (CJP) inside the cell links the TEG's cold junctions to the thermal sink, acting as a heat spreader (HTS) to increase the heat flux from the device. The thermal model describing the operation of the cell has been enhanced to inves-tigate different configurations for the HTS. For this application, the HTS utilizes radiation heat transfer to reject the waste heat to the thermal sink. A simple one-dimensional model is used to investigate the effect of the HTS geometry on the cell. Typically used in high power electronic heat dissipation, here the HTS allows for a greater influence by the thermal sink to increase cell output. Data for two-dimensional, radiatively cooled HTSs is presented, comparing cylindrical and rectangular geometries. The TEG module is modelled as a heat source {{in the center of the}} HTS. The results show that for typical Nighttime Solar Cell ™ thermal systems, square TEG modules can be modeled as cylindrical to match round heat spreaders with little loss of accuracy. The analysis also shows that the HTS thickness is favorable for using copper CJPs to increase the heat transfer to deep space while reducing the mechanical stress on the TEGs.

40|$|Man {{has been}} cooking food for {{thousands}} of years for a number of reasons: to improve flavour and palatability, sterilise, increase digestibility, improve texture and colour. Increasingly more advanced techniques are employed today in food production plants to engineer foods with many different properties. With this in mind manufacturers are constantly seeking to improve processing techniques and apply new or different technologies (such as microwaves, RF and extrusion) to develop foods with new properties (like puffed texture starches) and to increase process efficiencies (energy efficiency, water reduction). This thesis reports on work undertaken to demonstrate the potential to achieve high temperature starch conversion of whole wheat grains in a fluidised bed, thereby reducing the amount of water required and processing time. Specifically, wheat from the farm at 14 % water content is cooked in a fluidised bed. The fluidised bed heats the wheat quickly by convective heating. In addition, energy can be delivered directly to the grain by microwave heating during fluidisation. Degree of starch conversion is determined by measuring the reduction in size of endotherm of reaction as observed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The fluidising gas, processing temperature and starting moisture content were varied in order to investigate their effect on the cooking process. A mathematical model based on energy and species concentration equations was developed to help understand the internal grain processes. The model coupled the thermal energy equation with water diffusion. The effect of water evaporation was represented as <b>a</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>sink</b> in the energy equation. Popular kinetic models from literature were adapted to predict the degree of starch conversion. The model gives solutions consistent with experimental data and physical intuition. A commercial computational fluid dynamics package was used to study simple airflow and particle tracks in the fluidisation column. A comparison was made to photographic footage. Experimental data shows that starch conversion can be achieved in whole wheat grains at high temperatures in a fluidised bed without adding water. It also indicates that the material formed can be burnt, brittle and glassy.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and chemical kinetic {{study has been}} conducted to determine the role of water when it is added as a diluent to the fuel side of methane-air counterflow diffusion flames. This work is relevant to combustion processes where water is incorporated in the fuel; e. g., methane hydrates and applications for emission reduction such as in flares and H 2 O /fuel emulsions. The flame temperature profile and extinction limits were measured, and the flame structure was computed using detailed kinetic mechanisms. Predictions and experiments demonstrate that water mainly acts thermally to lower the flame temperature until extinction. Very close to extinction, however, the calculations show that water has a small but distinct chemical effect as it scavenges important chain branching radicals. Experiments and computations show that extinction limits (in terms of the H 2 O mass fraction) decrease with increasing strain rates; that is, flames can sustain more H 2 O vapor at low strain rates. Maximum flame temperature at extinction increases with increasing strain rates because there is less H 2 O to act as <b>a</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>sink.</b> Temperature and hydroxyl radical PLIF measurements confirm qualitative features found in the calculations, showing a reduction of peak values, {{a decrease in the}} reaction zone thickness, and a movement of the flame location with water addition. The two representative well-known chemical kinetic mechanisms examined overpredict the water carrying capacity of these flames in comparison to the experiments. A similar disagreement was not found when using carbon dioxide as the fuel diluent, which suggests that water-specific reactions may be responsible for the final stages of flame extinction in water-laden non-premixed flames. Computationally, chemical effects were distinguished from thermal effects by introducing of a nonreactive diluent molecule with the same thermal and transport properties as water. The study indicates that water's chemical effects are to change the production and depletion of OH, H and O radicals, especially near extinction. Furthermore, a reaction path analysis shows that atomic hydrogen plays a critical role in extinction through chain branching and chain terminating reactions. This chemical kinetic interpretation of water's role confirms some findings described in the literature, in particular, the influence from the chain terminating reaction and the considerable uncertainty in the value of water's chaperon efficiency. It is difficult to ascribe detailed behaviors to individual reactions in complex chemical kinetic mechanisms but the data presented in this dissertation provide a robust set of outcomes {{that can be used to}} refine key reaction parameters in water-laden flame chemistry...|$|E

40|$|The {{thermomechanical}} {{simulation of}} materials with evolving, multiphase microstructures poses various modeling and numerical challenges. For example, the separate phases in a multiphase microstructure can {{interact with each}} other during thermal and/or mechanical loading, the effect of which is significantly more complicated than the individual behavior of the phases. The interactive behavior also depends on the specific volume fractions and spatial distribution of the individual phases. An accurate modeling of the phases requires a thermodynamically consistent formulation and a robust numerical implementation of the evolution of the corresponding observable and internal variables. The complex nonlinear characteristics of these micromechanical models introduce substantial challenges with respect to their upscaling towards higher levels of observation, as necessary for analyzing large-scale engineering problems in a computationally efficient way. The work presented in this thesis addresses these aspects in detail by focusing on a class of multiphase steels, which are the so-called transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) steels. This class of structural steels shows an excellent combination of strength and ductility. The transformation-induced plasticity effect can be ascribed to the presence of grains of metastable austenite that are surrounded by ferritic grains. The austenite can undergo a phase transformation when subjected to thermal and/or mechanical loading, thereby introducing an increase in the effective material strength. In addition, both the austenite and the ferritic matrix may deform plastically, which increases the overall ductility of the material. In order to explore the complex micromechanical characteristics and the practical application of this material in more detail, three main research questions were identified, of which the first one is: (1) How can a TRIP steel microstructure be modelled in a fully thermodynamically consistent way? The thermomechanical coupling is particularly relevant since in TRIP steels the phase transformation occurring during mechanical loading is accompanied by the release of a substantial amount of energy (latent heat) that, in turn, affects the mechanical response of the material. The second research question formulated is: (2) How does the response of a TRIP steel microstructure depend on the spatial distribution of the austenitic phase within the ferritic matrix? From the viewpoint of practical applications, the attention here is focused on comparing the response of a TRIP steel sample with a banded austenitic microstructure to that of a sample with randomly distributed austenitic grains. Considering the large number of degrees of freedom of these and other engineering problems, a computationally efficient implementation of the micromechanical model is necessary. This issue is reflected by the third research question, which reads: (3) Is it possible to include the micromechanical constitutive behavior and geometry of the individual phases within an computationally efficient multiscale formulation? For answering the three research questions above, the thermomechanical behavior of the TRIP steel phases is modelled in a fully coupled way, where the generation of heat associated to the martensitic phase transformation and the plastic deformation are accounted for explicitly in the thermodynamic formulation. In analogy with the decomposition of the deformation, the entropy density is separated in a reversible contribution, a transformation contribution, a plasticity contribution and a thermal-mechanical coupling contribution. The last term follows from combining mechanical and thermal constitutive information of the individual phases with basic thermodynamical requirements. One of the observations resulting from this approach is that for a single crystal of austenite the increase in temperature associated with the latent heat of transformation reduces the transformation rate and significantly reduces the transformation-induced plasticity effect. However, for an aggregate of austenitic and ferritic grains, which is representative of a TRIP steel, the delay in the transformation-induced plasticity effect due to latent heat is relatively small, since the ferric matrix absorbs the latent heat generated in the austenite and thus effectively acts as <b>a</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>sink.</b> To evaluate the influence of the spatial distribution of the austenitic (secondary) phase within the ferritic matrix, the effective responses for banded and dispersed austenitic microstructures are computed by means of numerical homogenization. A comparison of these microstructures shows that banded microstructures may allow for plastic localization in the ferritic matrix, which, in comparison to dispersed microstructures, diminishes the strengthening effect provided by the austenitic phase. For the performance of more demanding computational simulations at higher (macroscopic) scales of observation, an efficient multiscale approach termed the generalized grain cluster method (GGCM) was developed. The method is suitable for the prediction of the effective macroscopic behavior of an aggregate of single-crystal grains composing a multiphase steel. The GGCM is based on the minimization of a functional that depends on the microscopic deformation gradients in the grains through the equilibrium requirements of the grains as well as kinematic compatibility between grains. By means of the specification of weighting factors it is possible to mimic responses falling between the Taylor and Sachs bounds. The numerical computation is carried out with an incremental-iterative algorithm based on a constrained gradient descent method. For a multiscale analysis, the GCCM can be included at integration points of a standard finite element code to simulate macroscopic problems. A comparison with FEM direct numerical simulations illustrates that the computational time of the GGCM may be up to about an order of magnitude lower. In large-scale FEM models for structural applications, the responses at material point level thus may either follow from the GGCM alone, or from combining this method with fully-resolved FEM modeling at the level of individual grains (i. e., a combined GGCM - FE 2 approach), depending on the required resolution.

The frequency of the radiation is tuned to be less than the energy gap in the superconductor, so that the pair breaking is not taking place. This photon pumping redistributes the electron-hole quasiparticles: their distribution function is non-equilibrium, and the “phonon-deficit effect” takes place. There is a dielectric material deposited on top of superconductor, which serves asthe “cold finger” of the cooler. Its “acoustical density” is supposed to be smaller than that of the superconducting material, so phonons are being “rectified” and propagate from, but not to it: the energy flows from the “cold finger” into the superconductor. The best reported rectification achieved as of today is about factor of five, which is marginal for our design. To further enhance the rectification, one can use the acoustical filtering. It can be arranged between the superconductor and the “cold finger”. Having a remarkably high heat conductivity and high acoustic density, the sapphire rod serves not only as a photonic wave-guide, but also as <b>a</b> <b>thermal</b> heat <b>sink.</b> It is thermally anchored to the bigger external heat-bath. Spectral phonon filters are arranged between sapphire and superconducting film, so that sapphire would only receive and absorb excess phonons without supplying deficient phonons to the superconductor.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of conducting long duration human spaceflight missions is largely {{dependent on the}} provision of consumables such as oxygen, water, and food. In addition to meeting crew metabolic needs, water sublimation has long served as the primary heat rejection mechanism in space suits during extravehicular activity (EVA). During a single eight hour EVA, approximately 3. 6 kg (8 lbm) of water is lost from the current suit. Reducing the amount of expended water during EVA is a long standing goal of space suit life support systems designers; but to date, no alternate thermal control mechanism has demonstrated the ability to completely eliminate the loss. One proposed concept is to convert the majority of a space suit’s surface area into a radiator such that the local environment {{can be used as}} <b>a</b> radiative <b>thermal</b> <b>sink</b> for rejecting heat without mass loss. Due to natural variations in both internal (metabolic) loads and external (environmental) sink temperatures, radiative transport must be actively modulated in order to maintain <b>an</b> acceptable <b>thermal</b> balance. Here, variable emissivity electrochromic devices are examined as the primary mechanism for enabling variable heat rejection. This dissertation focuses on theoretical and empirical evaluations performed to determine the {{feasibility of}} using a full suit, variable emissivity radiator architecture for space suit thermal control. Operational envelopes are described that show where a given environment and/or metabolic load combination {{may or may not be}} supported by the evaluated thermal architecture.

It is shown that single cell configurations with a solar cell area of 1 cm 2 can be cooled passively for concentration ratios of up to 500 × with <b>a</b> heat <b>sink</b> <b>thermal</b> resistance below 1. 63 K/W, however for high ambient temperatures (greater than 40 °C), <b>a</b> <b>thermal</b> resistance less than 1. 4 K/W is needed to keep the solar cell operating within safe operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Power {{semiconductors}} can {{be modeled}} as <b>a</b> <b>thermal</b> network of resistors and capacitors. The thermal boundary condition {{of such a}} model is typically defined as the heat sink surface temperature which {{is assumed to be}} constant. In reality, the heat sink surface temperature underneath the power module is not exactly known. In this paper we show how to set up <b>a</b> <b>thermal</b> model of the heat sink in form of <b>a</b> RC <b>thermal</b> equivalent network that can be directly embedded in any circuit simulator. The proposed <b>thermal</b> heat <b>sink</b> model takes into account convection cooling, thermal hotspots on the heat <b>sink</b> base plate, <b>thermal</b> time constants of the heat <b>sink,</b> and <b>thermal</b> coupling between different power modules mounted onto the heat sink. Experimental results are given and show high accuracy of the heat sink model with temperature errors below 10 %...|$|R

Suppose the maximum temperature is 125 °C, and the ambient temperature is 25 °C; then ΔT is 100 °C. The heat <b>sink's</b> <b>thermal</b> resistance to ambient must then be 0.5 °C/W or less (total resistance component and heat sink is then 1.0 °C/W).|$|R
40|$|A {{recently}} discovered superconductor, magnesium diboride (MgB 2), {{can be used}} to fabricate conducting leads used in cryogenic applications. Dis covered to be superconducting in 2001, MgB 2 has the advantage of remaining superconducting at higher temperatures than the previously used material, NbTi. The purpose of these leads is to provide 2 A of electricity to motors located in a 1. 3 K environment. The providing environment is a relatively warm 17 K. Requirements for these leads are to survive temperature fluctuations in the 5 K and 11 K heat sinks, and not conduct excessive heat into the 1. 3 K environment. Test data showed that each lead in the assembly could conduct 5 A at 4 K, which, when scaled to 17 K, still provided more than the required 2 A. The lead assembly consists of 12 steelclad MgB 2 wires, a tensioned Kevlar support, <b>a</b> <b>thermal</b> heat <b>sink</b> interface at 4 K, and base plates. The wires are soldered to heavy copper leads at the 17 K end, and to thin copper-clad NbTi leads at the 1. 3 K end. The leads were designed, fabricated, and tested at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe - Institut foer Technische Physik before inclusion in Goddard's XRS (X-Ray Spectrometer) instrument onboard the Astro-E 2 spacecraft. A key factor is that MgB 2 remains superconducting up to 30 K, which means that it does not introduce joule heating as a resistive wire would. Because the required temperature ranges are 1. 3 - 17 K, this provides a large margin of safety. Previous designs lost superconductivity at around 8 K. The disadvantage to MgB 2 {{is that it is a}} brittle ceramic, and making thin wires from it is challenging. The solution was to encase the leads in thin steel tubes for strength. Previous designs were so brittle as to risk instrument survival. MgB 2 leads can be used in any cryogenic application where small currents need to be conducted at below 30 K. Because previous designs would superconduct only at up to 8 K, this new design would be ideal for the 8 - 30 K range...|$|R

InAlAs offers isotropic etches and superior selectivity (> 4, 000) to InP {{when compared with}} InGaAs. A 500 nm thick InAlAs sacrificial layer allows the release of wide coupons with a surface roughness < 2 nm and a flatness < 20 nm.

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with multilayer and fine <b>thermal</b> control of <b>an</b> optical reference cavity for space applications, under development at National Metrology Institute, Turin, Italy. The cavity, made by ultra low expansion glass (Corning ULE), must be kept close to the zero-expansion temperature (close to 25 °C) of the glass. The target can only be met by active control, while leaving the cavity free of sensor and actuators. This is obtained by two concepts: thermal bath and reference <b>thermal</b> <b>sink,</b> the latter allowing zero-expansion temperature to be reached by heaters in a wide environment range. Preliminary experiments of the two concepts leading to cavity design are detailed...|$|R

The present conceptual study notes that while the exclusive use of thermal storage is suitable for the Space Shuttle mission, space station requirements are best satisfied by a hybrid system which combines thermal storage with radiator and heat pump. The Space Shuttle RNTS thermal control subsystem's thermal storage unit uses water as a phase change medium.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{thermoelectric cooler}} (TEC) {{applications in the}} electronic cooling. The cold side temperature (T(c)) and temperature difference between TEC cold and hot sides (DeltaT=T(h) -T(c), T(h) =temperature of hot side of TEC) were used as the parameters. The cooling capacity, junction temperature, coefficient of performance (COP) of TEC and the required heat <b>sink</b> <b>thermal</b> resistance at the TEC hot side were computed. The {{results indicated that the}} cooling capacity could be increased as T(c) increased and DeltaT was reduced. The maximum cooling capacity and chip junction temperature obtained were 207 W and 88 degreesC, respectively. The required heat <b>sink</b> <b>thermal</b> resistance on TEC hot side was 0. 054 degreesC/W. Larger cooling capacity and higher COP could be obtained when the TEC was operated in the enforced regimes (DeltaT< 0). However, TEC performance was restricted by the T(c) values and heat <b>sink</b> <b>thermal</b> resistance at the TEC hot side. A microchannel heat sink using water or air as the coolant was demonstrated to meet the low <b>thermal</b> heat <b>sink</b> resistance requirement for TEC operated at maximum cooling capacity conditions.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the flight results of the Cryogenic Two-Phase Flight Experiment (CRYOTP), which was a Hitchhiker based {{experiment}} that flew on the space shuttle Columbia in March of 1994 (STS- 62). CRYOTP tested two new technologies for advanced cryogenic thermal control; the Space Heat Pipe (SHP), which was a constant conductance cryogenic heat pipe, and the Brilliant Eyes Thermal Storage Unit (BETSU), which was <b>a</b> cryogenic phase-change <b>thermal</b> storage device. These two devices were tested independently during the mission. Analysis of the flight data indicated that the SHP was unable to start in either of two attempts, for reasons related to the fluid charge, parasitic heat leaks, and cryocooler capacity. The BETSU test article was successfully operated with more than 250 hours of on-orbit testing including several cooldown cycles and 56 freeze/thaw cycles. Some degradation was observed with the five tactical cryocoolers used as <b>thermal</b> <b>sinks,</b> {{and one of the}} cryocoolers failed completely after 331 hours of operation. Post-flight analysis indicated that this problem was most likely due to failure of an electrical controller internal to the unit...|$|R
