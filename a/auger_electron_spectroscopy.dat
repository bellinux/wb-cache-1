40|$|Chemical {{treatment}} by hydrazine-sulfide solutions, known to produce surface nitridation of GaAs(100), {{was applied to}} GaAs(111) A and B surfaces. The chemistries of these treatments for the Ga-terminated A surface and the As-terminated B one were investigated using synchrotron radiation photoemission and <b>Auger</b> <b>electron</b> <b>spectroscopies.</b> For the B surface, such treatment was found to produce an effective surface nitridation, via substitution of surface arsenic with nitrogen atoms from hydrazine molecules. The process automatically stops after formation of one monolayer. In contrast, the A surface is covered by sulfur bonded to underlying gallium. This extreme dependence on surface polarity is explained by competitive adsorption processes of H S- and O H- anions and of hydrazine molecules, on Ga-adsorption sites, which have distinct configurations on the A and B surfaces...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a surface {{modification}} of AISI 316 L stainless steel by surface irradiation with high energy, pulsed nitrogen ion beams generated with 0. 8 kJ dense plasma focus.

After the irradiation, we found a modification of a I pm thick surface layer, on which a gradual lattice expansion of the austenite with the number of irradiation pulses, i. e. with the total nitrogen ion fluence, was observed. In addition, similar to 40 nm close to the surface layer, a disordered lattice structure had been observed through TEM analysis. Those results can be explained in terms of the extreme thermal effect induced on the surface through the fast high energy release during the pulsed ion interaction with the steel surface, followed by an also rapid cooling down process which limits the nitrogen diffusion to the bulk.
