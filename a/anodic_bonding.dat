40|$|The {{ability to}} anodically bond Kovar to Pyrex 7740 {{significantly}} expands the packaging approaches available for MEMS devices. This technique greatly simplifies and reliably interconnects micropropulsion MEMS components (thrusters, valves) with the attached propellant system. Experimental bonds of Kovar plates and fixtures {{have been made}} to numerous Pyrex samples in order to investigate the strength and failure modes of these bonds. An emphasis on experimentally bonding at low temperatures (- 200 "C) using large voltages (< 2000 V) was also a important parameter of this research and a current microvalve project at JPL.

30|$|Anodically bonded {{substrates}} {{having a}} large cavity are fabricated for a silicon MEMS device. <b>Anodic</b> <b>bonded</b> substrates with four different bonding areas are simulated {{for the analysis}} of stresses, occurring during the CMP process. In order to prevent anodically bonded substrate fracture, the stress intensity of four samples is analyzed according to the bonded area and pattern of the glass pillar arrays inside the cavity. As the ratio of bonded area to cavity area increased from 7.0 to 21.2 %, the von Mises stress occurring during the CMP process was relieved from 89.5 to 0.3  MPa. As a result, the anodically bonded area and the distribution of the glass pillars inside the cavity are important factors for a stable subsequent CMP process, impacting the productivity, reliability and fabrication yield of the MEMS device.|$|R

Etch-back characteristics of ptype (100) 4 inch SOG wafer have been explored under the different ultrasonic power. It has been observed that the characteristics of etch-back such as the etch rate, etch uniformity and surface roughness were evidently improved under 120 W ultrasonic power agitation. The etching uniformity was less than +/- 1 % on the whole wafer. And the root-mean-square roughness (R(rms)) of 20. 6 nm was achieved after 360 mu m thickness silicon being etched. Some shortcomings of {{ultrasonic agitation}} such as damaging membrane and reducing the bonding intensity are observed and how to overcome these disadvantages in DDSOG process is also discussed.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of micromechanical components, such as acceleration sensors, pressure sensors, valves or micropumps, requires special joining technologies, like direct or <b>anodic</b> wafer <b>bonding.</b> An essential prerequisite for practical applications is a sufficient mechanical strength {{and reliability of}} the bonded interfaces. Therefore, appropriate testing techniques are required {{that can be applied}} to quality control, component design and failure analysis. Strength testing and FEM modelling have been employed to examine three types (tensile testing, DCB-test and test of chevron notched specimens) of tests. The investigations showed that strength testing of wafer bonded samples requires a careful assessment of the applied testing techniques with respect to the testing conditions, loading, sample geometry and analysis of the results...|$|R

50|$|<b>Anodic</b> <b>bonding</b> is a {{wafer bonding}} process to seal glass to either silicon or metal without {{introducing}} an intermediate layer; {{it is commonly}} used to seal glass to silicon wafers in electronics and microfluidics. This bonding technique, also known as field assisted bonding or electrostatic sealing, is mostly used for connecting silicon/glass and metal/glass through electric fields. The requirements for <b>anodic</b> <b>bonding</b> are clean and even wafer surfaces and atomic contact between the bonding substrates through a sufficiently powerful electrostatic field. Also necessary is the use of borosilicate glass containing a high concentration of alkali ions. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the processed glass needs to be {{similar to those of the}} bonding partner.|$|E

40|$|Silicon-based microdevices for NO 2 {{detection}} and DNA amplification {{have been developed}} using bulk and surface micromachining technology. Thin film gas sensor has many advantages such as low production cost and possible integration with microelectronics. WO 3 {{was chosen as the}} sensing material in this study due to its high sensitivity toward NO 2. A thin film gas sensor consists of a pair of Au electrodes and WO 3 sensing film has been fabricated on silicon substrate. The structural, compositional and electrical characteristics of the NO 2 sensor have been studied in detail. The WO 3 sensing film was found to be in triclinic phase and close to its stoichiometric ratio. On one hand, sensitivity of the sensor increases sharply with decreasing annealing time due to smaller grain size at short annealing time. On the other hand, it increases slowly with increasing annealing time for annealing time longer than 4 hr as a result of surge in oxygen vacancy concentration. Furthermore, higher sensitivity could be achieved at lower operating temperature, and the optimum was found at 200 °C. The presence of NO 2 could be detected at concentration as low as 1 ppm, and its high selectivity enabled the detection of NO 2 to be distinguished from other interfering gases such as NO, CO, and H 2. The sensor fabricated in this work is relatively stable and presents no compositional change after experiment. The sensing film can be ultimately integrated with micro-hot plate (MHP) for in-situ gas measurement. Prototypical microreactors with integrated heaters and temperature sensors, either Pt-based or polysilicon-based, have been established on silicon substrates for DNA amplification. The reaction chamber is capped from the top by either silicon or silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) membrane, and <b>anodic</b> <b>bonded</b> from the bottom by a borosilicate glass. The Si 3 N 4 membrane provides an excellent thermal isolation for the reaction chamber so that thermal budget of the device is minimized. We have also implemented a digital PI control algorithm to ensure a precise temperature control, and rapid heating and cooling for fast thermal cycling of reagents. Chip-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been successfully demonstrated using 10 μl Pt microreactor with silicon membrane. Similar amplification performance has been achieved using this microreactor compared with the conventional thermal cycler.

The applied novel process sequence can eliminate the need of a possible flip-chip bonding and chemical–mechanical polishing steps.

40|$|Wafer bonding is an {{enabling}} technology in substrate engineering, MEMS manufacturing and packaging {{as well as}} for hybrid integration of MEMS and CMOS. The mainstream semiconductor industry is currently exploring wafer bonding as a possible technology for 3 D integration of IC devices. Several Bonding Processes exist today and can be classified under different aspects. They can be more or less well controlled and have been established in volume production of MEMS devices. Cost is still a critical factor, but sometimes there are no alternatives to wafer bonding to ensure the device functionality. Among many bonding processes with intermediate layers there are only two processes not using intermediate layers, the <b>anodic</b> and direct <b>bonding.</b> In this paper these two processes of bonding Silicon to glass wafers, are compared in some details.

These glasses have a similar CTE to silicon {{in the range of}} applied temperature, commonly up to 400 °C.|$|E
50|$|The wafers {{that meet}} the {{requirements}} are put into atomic contact. As soon as contact is first established, the bonding process starts close to the cathode and spreads in fronts to the edges, the process taking several minutes.The <b>anodic</b> <b>bonding</b> procedure {{is based on a}} glass wafer that is usually placed above a silicon wafer. An electrode is in contact with the glass wafer either through a needle or a full area cathode electrode.|$|E
50|$|Bulk {{micromachining}} is {{the oldest}} paradigm of silicon based MEMS. The whole thickness of a silicon wafer is used for building the micro-mechanical structures. Silicon is machined using various etching processes. <b>Anodic</b> <b>bonding</b> of glass plates or additional silicon wafers is used for adding features in the third dimension and for hermetic encapsulation. Bulk micromachining has been essential in enabling high performance pressure sensors and accelerometers that changed the sensor industry in the 1980s and 90's.|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of optical micro systems imposes new challenges on assembly technologies. These include {{the handling of}} multiple heterogeneous substrates, low thermal budget {{for the establishment of}} bonding connections, the accurate alignment of the substrates during wafer stacking and the integration of special components such as discrete optical lenses. In order to address these problems, a hierarchic wafer/component bonding process is proposed for the assembly of a 3 -axis confocal scanning microscope. Experiment results indicate that the 9 constitutive components of the microscope, which are made from materials with different thermal expansion coefficients, can be joined together at less than 400 °C global temperature. The strength of the achieved bonding is comparable to standard <b>anodic</b> or fusion <b>bonding</b> and can withstand diverse back-end-of-line processes such as dicing or grinding. Besides, the hermeticity of the developed bonding process is validated by monitorin g the static deformation of a leak-indicating membrane...|$|R
40|$|Integrated {{lab-on-a-chip}} devices {{provide the}} promise of many benefits in many application areas. A low noise, high resolution, high sensitivity integrated optical microfluidic device would not only improve the capabilities of existing procedures but also enable new applications. This thesis presents an architecture and fabrication process for such a device. Previously, the possibilities for such integrated systems were limited by existing fabrication technologies. An integrated fabrication process including glass nanofluidics, diffused waveguides and metal structures was developed. To enable this process a voltage-assisted polymer bond procedure was developed. This bond process enables high strength, robust, optically clear, low temperature bonding of glass - a capability that was not possible before. Bond strength was compared with a glass-to-glass <b>anodic</b> type <b>bond</b> using various materials and a polymer bond using two polymers: Cytop and PMMA. Bond strength was far superior to standard polymer bonding procedures. Design considerations to minimize background noise are presented, analyzed and implemented. Using Cytop as an index-matched polymer layer reduces scattered light in the device. Plasmonic devices driven via evanescent fields were designed, simulated, fabricated, and tested in isolation {{as well as in}} the integrated system. A sample device was made to demonstrate applicability of this process to direct linear analysis of DNA. The device was shown to provide enhanced and confined electromagnetic excitation as well as the capability to excite submicron particles. A demonstrated excitation spot of 200 nm is the best we have seen in this type of device. Further work is suggested that can improve this resolution further. by Jonathan S. Varsanik. Thesis (Ph. D.)

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method comprises producing light sensor arrangements (4 A, 4 B, 4 C) in a semiconductor material of a first wafer (3) at a first side of the wafer for each of micro-optical components to be produced, patterning a second wafer (2) having an optically transparent material on a side opposite to the first side of the first wafer {{in such a way that}} micro-optical elements (1 A, 1 B, 1 C) are formed in it for each of the microoptoelectronic components to be produced, producing a wafer stack by wafer bonding, where the wafer stack has the first wafer and the second wafer arranged above the first wafer, and singulating the wafer stack in the micro-optoelectronic components. Each of the micro-optical elements is arranged and optically structured in such a way that different portions of the light incident on the micro-optical element are directed onto different light sensor elements (4 a, 4 b, 4 c, 4 d, 4 e) of a light sensor arrangement arranged partly below the micro-optical element. The wafer <b>bonding</b> is an <b>anodic</b> wafer <b>bonding</b> or silicon direct bonding, which is carried out by using adhesive. The production of the light sensor arrangements takes place after or before the production of the wafer stack. The patterning step is carried out by etching and by shaping through viscous design and takes place before the production of the wafer stack. The optically transparent material is a glass, which is adapted to the semiconductor material of the first wafer with respect to the thermal expansion coefficient. The method further comprises producing cavities in the first wafer, where the cavities of the first wafer are arranged, so that different portions of the light incident on the micro-optical element are directed onto different light sensor elements of the light sensor arrangement arranged partly below the micro-optical element, providing an additional wafer, producing cavities in the additional wafer, producing a wafer stack using wafer bonding, where the wafer stack has the first wafer and the additional wafer and the cavities of the additional wafer are arranged, so that different portions of the light incident on the micro-optical element are directed onto different light sensor elements of the light sensor arrangement arranged partly below the micro-optical element, producing an optically transparent window in the first wafer, so that the light passes through the wafer.

50|$|The bonding {{strength}} is mainly {{dependent on the}} density, the spreading area of the glass frit layer and the surface layer of the bonding interface. It is high enough, around 20 MPa, for most applications and comparable to those achieved with <b>anodic</b> <b>bonding.</b> The hermeticity ensures the correct function and a sufficient reliability of the bond and therefore the product. Further, the bonding yield of glass frit bonded wafers is very high, normally > 90 %.|$|E
50|$|Wafer Bonders join {{two or more}} aligned {{substrates}} {{to create}} an integrated circuit. The substrates can be joined, or bonded, using the following techniques: fusion bonding, <b>anodic</b> <b>bonding,</b> eutectic bonding, solder bonding, glass frit bonding, adhesive bonding. Temporary wafer bonding is performed on thinned wafers that are placed on a carrier for support. It gets its name because the adhesive used for bonding is removed. This process is used mainly to manufacture 3D Integrated Circuits. SUSS MicroTec produces equipment that supports all of these bonding techniques.|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{micromachining}} {{techniques such}} as wet etching, dry etching, deep reactive ion etching, sputtering, <b>anodic</b> <b>bonding,</b> and fusion bonding {{have been used in}} bio-MEMS to make flow channels, flow sensors, chemical detectors, separation capillaries, mixers, filters, pumps and valves. However, there are some drawbacks to using silicon-based devices in biomedical applications such as their high cost and bioincompatibility. Due to being single-use only, larger than their MEMS counterparts, and the requirement of clean room facilities, high material and processing costs make silicon-based bio-MEMS less economically attractive. In vivo, silicon-based bio-MEMS can be readily functionalized to minimize protein adsorption, but the brittleness of silicon remains a major issue.|$|E
50|$|Further, {{the bonding}} has less restrictions, {{concerning}} substrate roughness and planarity than direct bonding. Compared to <b>anodic</b> <b>bonding,</b> no high voltages are required {{that can be}} detrimental to electrostatic MEMS. Additionally, the eutectic bonding procedure promotes a better out-gassing and hermeticity than bonding with organic intermediate layers. Compared to glass frit bonding, the advantage sticks out that the reduction of seal ring geometries, an increase of the hermeticity levels and a shrinking of device size is possible. The geometry of eutectic seals {{is characterized by a}} thickness of 1 - 5 µm and a wideness of > 50 µm. The use of eutectic alloy brings the advantage of providing electrical conduction and interfacing with redistribution layers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anodic</b> <b>bonding</b> on silicon {{substrates}} {{is divided}} into bonding using a thin sheet of glass (a wafer) or a glass layer that is deposited onto the silicon using a technique such as sputtering. The glass wafer is often sodium-containing Borofloat or Pyrex glasses. With an intermediate glass layer, {{it is also possible}} to connect two silicon wafers. The glass layers are deposited by sputtering, spin-on of a glass solution or vapor deposition upon the processed silicon wafer. The thickness of these layers range from one to a few micrometers with spin-on glass layers needing 1 µm or less. Hermetic seals of silicon to glass using an aluminum layer with thickness of 50 to 100 nm can reach strengths of 18.0 MPa. This method enables burying electrically isolated conductors in the interface. Bonding of thermally oxidized wafers without a glass layer is also possible.|$|E
50|$|Both {{bulk and}} surface silicon {{micromachining}} {{are used in}} the industrial production of sensors, ink-jet nozzles, and other devices. But in many cases the distinction between these two has diminished. A new etching technology, deep reactive-ion etching, has made it possible to combine good performance typical of bulk micromachining with comb structures and in-plane operation typical of surface micromachining. While it is common in surface micromachining to have structural layer thickness in the range of 2 µm, in HAR silicon micromachining the thickness can be from 10 to 100 µm. The materials commonly used in HAR silicon micromachining are thick polycrystalline silicon, known as epi-poly, and bonded silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers although processes for bulk silicon wafer also have been created (SCREAM). Bonding a second wafer by glass frit bonding, <b>anodic</b> <b>bonding</b> or alloy bonding is used to protect the MEMS structures.

50|$|Strong {{electric}} {{fields are}} created by thermal poling of silica, subjecting the glass simultaneously to temperatures {{in the range of}} 280 °C and a few kilovolts bias for several minutes. Cations are mobile at elevated temperature (e.g., Na+) and are displaced by the poling field from the anode side of the sample. This creates a region a few micrometers thick of high electrical resistivity depleted of positive ions near the anodic surface. The depleted region is negatively charged, and if the sample is cooled to room temperature with the poling voltage is on, the distribution of electrons becomes frozen. After poling, positive charge attracted to the anodic surface and negative charge inside the glass create a recorded field that can reach 109 V/m. More detailed studies, show that {{there is little or no}} accumulation of cations near the cathode electrode, and that the layer nearest to the anode suffers partial neutralization if poling persists for an excessively long time. The process of glass poling is very similar to the one used for <b>Anodic</b> <b>bonding,</b> where the recorded electric field bonds the glass sample to the anode.|$|E
