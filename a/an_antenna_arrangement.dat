40|$|The Super Dual Aural Radar Network (SuperDARN) forms a {{multinational}} collaboration consisting of over 30 HF radars {{used to monitor}} charged particle convections in the high latitudes of the ionosphere. This research is inspired by the antenna arrangement {{of one of these}} HF radars situated at the South African National Antarctic Expedition (SANAE) IV base. This radar consists of a steered 16 -element primary array, and a second 4 -element interferometer array. Phase wrapping is introduced into echoed returns due to the two arrays being separated by 100 m, several wavelengths of the carrier frequency. As a result, the radar system is only able to unambiguously determine the Angle of Arrival (AOA) for a given target provided it resides below 33 ᵒ in elevation when observing along boresight. This dissertation models a subcomponent of this phenomenon and develops an entirely separate pulsed-Doppler radar system on an FPGA platform known as the Red Pitaya. Operating parameters are specifically chosen to be consistent with the SANAE IV radar. <b>An</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>arrangement</b> consisting of two receivers and a transmitter is constructed to replicate the AOA issue experienced by the SANAE radar. Instead of focusing on detecting targets in elevation, as done with the SuperDARN radars, targets are detected in azimuth. Three algorithms are developed to autonomously measure the AOA and to counteract the effects of 2 π phase wrapping. The naïve measurement applies no corrections and is only able to detect targets at angles within ± 17. 10 ᵒ of boresight. This is the theoretical maximum measurable AOA when operating at 17 MHz. A second algorithm involving a Standard Deviation (STDEV) search process is used to successfully measure angles up to ± 70 ᵒ for the same arrangement. It does this by varying the carrier frequency and using numerous received aliased AOAs to correct and expand for a true AOA. Empirical results yield an average Mean Square Error (MSE) of 0. 29 between the true and measured target angles. A third algorithm involving the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) was shown to work in theory (albeit only up to ± 66 ᵒ), but failed to perform in practice. Results presented in this dissertation indicate that the maximum measurable AOA is expanded by a factor of 4 by using the STDEV algorithm. It is postulated that the same result can be achieved using the actual SuperDARN radar. Theory relevant to generating the RF Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) chirp and its use for transmitting, receiving and processing is covered.

40|$|The {{last twenty}} years have seen many {{clinical}} studies showing the ability of hyperthermia to remarkably enhance response to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The objective of hyperthermia treatment is to raise the temperature in tumors to therapeutic levels, for a sufficient period of time, {{in order to achieve}} cell death or render the cells more sensitive to ionizing radiation and/or chemotherapy. One of the challenges in hyperthermia is to adequately heat deep-seated tumors while preventing surrounding healthy tissue from undesired heating and damage. In this thesis, a new focusing technique, based on a time-reversal (TR) approach, for microwave hyperthermia is described and evaluated. First, the method was tested numerically using 2 -D computer models of breast and neck. The obtained results were encouraging and suggest a multifrequency approach, in which the choice of frequency depends on the treated area size {{as well as on the}} tumor volume. Building on these results, <b>a</b> specific broadband <b>antenna</b> array was designed.

The accuracy of the signal delivery as prescribed by the treatment planning tool is similar to clinical standards. However, at present, the output power allows only for experiments with phantoms or animals. The results show great promise and will be further investigated in clinical studies. Finally, the feasibility of microwave thermal imaging as a non-invasive approach for temperature monitoring during the treatment was investigated. The initial results of this approach, which is based on the variation of the dielectric properties with temperature, are encouraging.

40|$|In a radio {{frequency}} (RF) system, the front-end {{of a radio}} receiver consists of <b>an</b> active <b>antenna</b> <b>arrangement</b> with <b>a</b> conducting mode <b>antenna</b> along with <b>an</b> active circuit. This arrangement helps avoid losses and SNR degradation due {{to the use of}} a coaxial cable. The active circuit is essentially an impedance matching network and a low noise amplification (LNA) stage. The input impedance of the antenna is always different from the source impedance required to be presented at the LNA input for maximum power gain and this gives rise to undesired reflections at the antenna-LNA junction. This necessitates a matching network that provides the impedance matching between the antenna and the LNA at a central frequency (CF). From the Friis formula it is seen that the total noise figure (NF) of the system is dependent on the noise figure and gain of the first stage. So, by having an LNA that provides a high gain (typically > 15 dB) which inserts minimum possible noise (desirably < 1 dB), the overall noise figure of the system can be maintained low. The LNA amplifies the signal to a suitable power level that will enable the subsequent demodulation and decoding stages to efficiently recover the original signal. The antenna and the LNA can be matched with each other in two possible ways. The first approach is the traditional method followed in RF engineering where in both the antenna and LNA are matched to 50  Ω terminations and connected to each other. In this classical method, the antenna and LNA are matched to 50  Ω at the CF and {{does not take into account}} the matching at other frequencies in the operation range. The second approach employs a co-design method to match the antenna and LNA without a matching network or with minimum possible components for matching. This is accomplished by varying one or more parameters of either the antenna or LNA to control the impedances and ultimately achieve a matching over a substantial range of frequencies instead at the CF alone. The co-design method is shown to provide higher gain and a lower NF with reduced number of components, cost and size as compared to the classical method. The thesis work presented here is a study, design and manufacturing of an antenna-LNA module for a wide frequency range of 1. 7 GHz – 2. 7 GHz to explore the gain and NF improvements in the co-design approach. Planar micro strip patch antennas and GaAs E-pHEMT transistor based LNA’s are designed and the matching and co-design are simulated to test the gain and NF improvements. Furthermore, fully functional prototypes are developed with Roger R 04360 substrate and the results from simulations and actual measurements are compared and discusse...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—For fixed {{satellite}} services (FSS) {{the performance of}} a single carrier- frequency domain equalizer (SC-FDE) MIMO system concept for line of sight (LOS) MIMO satellite channels is evaluated for the case of orthogonal and nearly orthogonal channels. The channel orthogonality is achieved by adjusting the phase angles within the channel transfer matrix through the LOS path distance which the signals have to travel between the respective transmit-receive antenna pair. This strategy finally leads to locally specific <b>antenna</b> <b>arrangements</b> needed for orthogonal channels with identical eigenmodes and maximum spatial multiplexing gain. For this particular type of channel a system has recently been proposed which revealed a very good performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) and mutual information. However, once the MIMO system has been optimized this way, practical impairments such as movements and maneuvers of the satellite or imperfect <b>antenna</b> <b>arrangements</b> of the user terminals might again cause a violation of the channel orthogonality. In this case the system performance suffers from spatial co-channel interference between the MIMO signal streams, which after all reduces the achievable throughput. This is analyzed and quantified in the paper for a typical scenario, and improvement potential is revealed by the application of a V-BLAST successive interference cancelation (SIC) scheme together with zero-forcing channel equalization.
