40|$|Animal {{models of}} {{acquired}} epilepsies aim to provide researchers with tools {{for use in}} understanding the processes underlying the acquisition, development and establishment of the disorder. Typically, following a systemic or local insult, vulnerable brain regions undergo a process leading to the development, over time, of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Many such models make use of a period of intense seizure activity or status epilepticus, {{and this may be}} associated with high mortality and/or global damage to large areas of the brain. These undesirable elements have driven improvements in the design of chronic epilepsy models, for example the lithium-pilocarpine epileptogenesis model. Here, we present an optimised model of chronic epilepsy that reduces mortality to 1 % whilst retaining features of high epileptogenicity and development of spontaneous seizures. Using local field potential recordings from hippocampus in vitro as a probe, we show that the model does not result in significant loss of neuronal network function in area CA 3 and, instead, subtle alterations in network dynamics appear during a process of epileptogenesis, which eventually leads to a chronic seizure state. The model’s features of very low mortality and high morbidity in the absence of global neuronal damage offer the chance to explore the processes underlying epileptogenesis in detail, in a population of <b>animals</b> <b>not</b> <b>defined</b> by their resistance to seizures, whilst acknowledging and being driven by the 3 Rs (Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of animal use in scientific procedures) principles...|$|E
40|$|Adseverin is an actin-severing/capping {{protein that}} may {{contribute}} to osteoclast differentiation in vitro but its role in bone remodeling of healthy <b>animals</b> is <b>not</b> <b>defined.</b> We analyzed bone and osteoclast structure in adseverin conditional null mice at alveolar and long bone sites. In wild-type and adseverin null mice, as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, {{there were no differences}} of bone mineral content or bone mineral density, indicating no change of bone metabolism. In tibiae, TRAcP+ osteoclasts were formed in comparable numbers in adseverin null and wild-type mice. Ultrastructural analysis showed normal and similar abundance of ruffled borders, sealing zones, and mitochondria, and with no difference of osteoclast nuclear numbers. In contrast, analyses of long bone showed that in the absence of adseverin osteoclasts were smaller (120 +/- 13 vs. 274 +/- 19 A mu m(2); p < 0. 05), as were nuclear size and the surface area of cytoplasm. The nuclei of adseverin null osteoclasts exhibited more heterochromatin (31 A +/- 3 %) than wild-type cells (8 A +/- 1 %), suggesting that adseverin affects cell differentiation. The data indicate that in healthy, developing tissues, adseverin contributes to the regulation of osteoclast structure but not to bone metabolism in viv...|$|R
30|$|In humans, ACS {{is defined}} as IAH (sustained IAP > 20 mmHg in adults [1] and IAP > 10 mmHg in {{children}} [28], respectively) in combination with new ongoing organ failure. Useful tools to quantify organ dysfunctions are statistical models such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score in adults [29, 30] and the Pediatric Risk of Mortality score in children [31]. Need for mechanical ventilation, oliguria, and circulatory instability are the signs typically observed when IAH progresses to ACS. Since prerequisites for an ACS in <b>animals</b> have <b>not</b> been <b>defined</b> yet [32], a relevant animal model of ACS should display this 'classic triad' of an ACS [33 – 36]. In the present investigation, the ventilated animals displayed a decreased circulatory and renal function. Depending {{on the level of}} IAH, intestinal ischemia and BT to the intestinal wall, as well as to MLN, also occurred.|$|R
50|$|She {{was born}} in Austin, Texas, but, because her father was an Air Force Officer, her {{childhood}} was spent {{in a number of}} Air Force Bases. The last, where her father retired, was in Riverside, California, where she attended the University of California. There Victoria Elizabeth Hearne received her B.A. in English. She subsequently spent more than twenty-five years studying animal behavior as a horse and dog trainer. Central to Hearne's view on animal training was her belief that <b>animals</b> should <b>not</b> be <b>defined</b> by behaviorists' dictates, that in their individuality they have the capacity to be in reciprocal relationships with humans both emotionally and morally. In addition to her poetry, she authored several books on animals and animal-training theory, including Adam's Task, Bandit, and Animal Happiness. She received a 1992 award for outstanding literary achievement from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of juvenile animal toxicity studies of pharmaceuticals is to obtain safety data, including {{information on the}} potential for adverse effects on postnatal growth and development. Studies in juvenile animals may assist in identifying postnatal developmental toxicities or other adverse effects that are not adequately assessed in the routine toxicity evaluations and that cannot be safely or adequately measured in pediatric clinical trials. Unlike the traditional reproductive and developmental toxicology {{studies that have been}} discussed in the accompanying reports, the design requirements for toxicity studies in juvenile <b>animals</b> are <b>not</b> explicitly <b>defined</b> in regulatory guidance. However, studies in juvenile animals can be useful in providing safety information necessary to enable pediatric clinical trials in pediatric patients or when there are special concerns for toxicities that cannot be safely or adequately measured in clinical trials. These juvenile animal toxicity studies are designed on a case-by-case basis. General design considerations and examples of study designs for assessment of juvenile animal toxicity are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Gravid mammals {{are more}} prone to {{listeriosis}} than their nongravid counterparts. However, many features of the disease in gravid <b>animals</b> are <b>not</b> well <b>defined.</b> We determined, in mice, that increased susceptibility to lethal infection following oral inoculation begins surprisingly early in pregnancy and extends through embryonic development. Pregnancy did not demonstrably increase the spread of listeriae from the intestine to the liver and spleen in the initial 96 h period post inoculation. Consequently, it appeared that gravid animals were competent to contain an enteric infection, but in those instances where escape did occur, a lethal outcome was more likely. Interestingly, colonic colonization level and prevalence, measured 96 h post inoculation, was significantly higher in gravid individuals. In terms of human risk factors for listeriosis, our results suggest that the window of listeriosis susceptibility afforded by pregnancy may be open longer than previously appreciated. Our results also suggest that while gravid animals are competent to contain an enteric infection, enteric carriage rate may be more of a factor in defining disease incidence than previously considered...|$|R

But till now the key antigens of P. multocida B: 2 isolate causing haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) in <b>animals</b> are <b>not</b> clearly <b>defined.</b> In this study, P 52 strain of P. multocida serotype B: 2 was grown in vitro under iron-rich and iron-limited condition. The OMPs were extracted by sarkosyl method followed by SDS-PAGE and the proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. In total, 22 proteins were identified, of which 7 were observed exclusively under iron-limited condition. Most of the high molecular weight proteins (TbpA, HgbA, HgbB, HasR, IroA, and HemR) identified in this study were involved in iron acquisition. Some hypothetical proteins (HP-KCU- 10206, HP and AAUPMB 08244, HP AAUPMB 21592, HP AAUPMB 19766, AAUPMB 11295) were observed {{for the first time in}} this study which could be unique to serotype B: 2. Further functional in vivo study of the proteins identified are required to explore the utility of these proteins in developing diagnostics and vaccine against HS...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of the zebrafish model system, the optimal husbandry conditions for this <b>animal</b> are <b>not</b> well <b>defined.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of stocking density on reproductive performance in zebrafish. In this study, undertaken by eight different zebrafish facilities, clutches of at least 200 wild-type zebrafish embryos from a single pairwise mating were produced at each participating institution and subsequently reared according to "in-house protocols" until they were 14 weeks old. Fish were then randomly assigned into treatment groups with balanced sex ratios and densities of 3, 6, or 12 fish/L. After a 1 -month acclimation period, fish were spawned in pair crosses every 2 weeks for 3 months, for a total of six spawning dates. The number of viable and nonviable embryos produced in each clutch were counted at 1 day postfertilization. Although there was a great deal of variability in clutch size and percent spawning success among laboratories, there were no significant differences in average clutch size, spawning success, or percent viable among the treatment densities. These data suggest that using stocking densities as high as 12 fish/L does not have a negative impact on performance, when measured by reproductive performance...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Current {{treatment}} of the abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is based on consensus definitions but several questions regarding fluid regime or critical level of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH)) remain unsolved. It is questionable whether these issues can be addressed in prospective randomized trials in the near future. This review aimed to summarize current animal models and to outline requirements for the best model. METHODS: PubMed data base was searched for articles describing animal models of ACS. RESULTS: 25 articles were found. ACS in <b>animals</b> has <b>not</b> been <b>defined</b> yet. Investigations varied considerably regarding the experimental design. Animals were rats, rabbits, dogs and pigs with a bodyweight from 200 g to 70 kg. IAP increase varied from 20 to 50 mmHg. The time period of IAH ranged between 30 min and 24 h. The time between the IAH insult and organ dysfunction varied between 15 min and 18 h. Investigations demonstrated that IAH is able to induce loss of intravascular volume, organ hypoperfusion, ischemic organ damage and multiple organ failure within 4 to 6 h. CONCLUSION: In contrast to IAH or pneumoperitoneum for surgical exposure, ACS in an animal may be stated if an artificially increased IAP leads to circulatory, respiratory and renal insufficiency. A next step in animal research would be {{the development of a}} "pathological" model in which haemorrhage or systemic inflammation together with resuscitation lead to abdominal fluid accumulation and increased intra-abdominal pressure. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|While the simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) -infected rhesus monkey {{is an important}} animal model for human {{immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) infection of humans, {{much remains to be}} learned about the evolution of the humoral immune response in this model. In HIV- 1 infection, autologous neutralizing antibodies emerge 2 to 3 months after infection. However, the ontogeny of the SIV-specific neutralizing antibody response in mucosally infected <b>animals</b> has <b>not</b> been <b>defined.</b> We characterized the kinetics of the autologous neutralizing antibody response to the transmitted/founder SIVmac 251 using a pseudovirion-based TZM-bl cell assay and monitored env sequence evolution using single-genome amplification in four rhesus animals that were infected via intrarectal inoculations. We show that the SIVmac 251 founder viruses induced neutralizing antibodies at 5 to 8 months after infection. Despite their slow emergence and low titers, these neutralizing antibodies selected for escape mutants that harbored substitutions and deletions in variable region 1 (V 1), V 2, and V 4 of Env. The neutralizing antibody response was initially focused on V 4 at 5 to 8 months after infection and then targeted V 1 /V 2 and V 4 by 16 months. These findings reveal a striking delay in the development of neutralizing antibodies in SIVmac-infected animals, thus raising questions concerning the suitability of SIVmac 251 as a challenge strain to screen AIDS vaccines that elicit neutralizing antibodies as a means to prevent virus acquisition. They also illustrate the capacity of the SIVmac quasispecies to modify antigenic determinants in response to very modest titers of neutralizing antibodies...|$|R
