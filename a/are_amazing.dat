As the plane is brought down, [...] "pieces of wreckage catch fire and burn as they fall to earth. There is also a smaller plane that flies through the airborne debris. It’s a very complex sequence, combining CG, effects simulations and pyrotechnics." [...] Series visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack elaborated that [...] "Doing fire realistically on television is a tall order. You don’t get the representation of what a real fire element looks like using software, but the guys at FuseFX, those FX animators <b>are</b> <b>amazing.</b> It takes a long time and a lot of set up to get things right.

Between Houdini and the particles we had to create for that one shot—a big giant virtual shot where we had a QuinJet come down and all the debris is falling all around and there’s fire and smoke, that sequence was what that episode was about. It was a big scene to pull off." ...|$|E
500|$|Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden {{was filmed}} at Madison Square Garden in Gaga's {{hometown}} of New York City, the two-hour special {{was directed by}} the singer's choreographer Laurieann Gibson and produced by HBO, with the first broadcast on the channel on May 7, 2011, a day after Gaga's last date of The Monster Ball Tour. The channel had released a trailer for the special in YouTube and a poster in their website, which showed Gaga with her characteristic pyrotechnic bra emitting sparks. According to Billboard, the special was watched by 1.2million viewers. The special received critical acclaim. On review aggregate website Metacritic, the special holds a rating of 81 out of 100 based on four critic reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald wrote, [...] "etween the orgy of visuals—stripper strobes, androgynous dancers and a very loose, X-rated 'Wizard of Oz' theme—we get some great song and dance numbers: 'Poker Face', 'Paparazzi' and 'Bad Romance'. These <b>are</b> <b>amazing</b> hits, club-thumping tracks that define joy and sadness for a generation of suburban teens and the urban disenfranchised." [...] However, {{he felt that the}} show's non-concert content was not genuine, and found the special to be similar to Madonna's 1991 documentary [...] The A.V. Clubs Genevieve Koski gave the special a B+ rating, claiming that Gaga [...] "proves that she is a performer" [...] and that [...] "she puts on a show", though she felt that the concert was overly emotional and artistically ambitious, and that Gaga's on-stage banter was slightly annoying. Koski also compared the special to the Madonna documentary. Linda Stassi from New York Post was also positive in her assessment of the concert special. She complimented the behind the scenes footage, the costumes and the dancing and the pyrotechnics of the show, describing it as [...] "a concert that would make Madonna’s shows look like run-of-the-mill dinner theater." [...] A review in website Idolator described Gaga as [...] "ringleader of her own circus — in complete control of her little monsters".

So it's as easy as them kind of recording everything, which is actually probably tough because they're constantly working with Scott on Stone Temple Pilot stuff. So the band is always there, you know what I mean, we're alive, we talk, Dean and I are constantly in communication. Ray Luzier, every time I see him he's like [...] "Man that Army of Anyone record is still, people still come up to me and talk about that Army of Anyone record".

He stated, [...] "the clip is nearly as joyful and super-charged as the song itself, with its barrage of world-class hooks complemented by a rapid succession of memorable, charming and sexy images." [...] Ray Rahman of New York magazine wrote that Knowles [...] "packs the short video with all her classic signatures: being amazing at dancing, recruiting teams of others to be amazing at dancing, and proving how even her fingers <b>are</b> <b>amazing</b> at dancing. But also, and possibly most importantly: Babyoncé!" [...] Kathleen Perricone of Daily News wrote that [...] "Beyoncé's baby isn't even born yet – and already it's a star" [...] referring to her abdomen in the video. Erika Ramiirez of Billboard commented that [...] "even with a bun in the oven, Beyoncé can still bring it." [...] CNN wrote that [...] "the imagery is a hodge-podge of modern and retro styling created in an ultra-bright palette, and staccato camera work effortlessly matches 'Countdown's' beat." [...] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker wrote, [...] "And though Beyoncé's video for 'Countdown' is close to the top of pack simply on the strength of extreme shoulder work, the video art form is going through a phase of robust, competitive health, probably because the money's gone." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{idea that}} the {{extraordinary}} narrative which {{has been called the}} Joyce- Armstrong Fragment is an elaborate practical joke evolved by some unknown person, cursed by a perverted and sinister sense of humour, has now been abandoned by all who have examined the matter. The most macabre and imaginative of plotters would hesitate before linking his morbid fancies with the unquestioned and tragic facts which reinforce the statement. Though the assertions contained in it <b>are</b> <b>amazing</b> and even monstrous, it is none the less forcing itself upon the general intelligence that they are true, and that we must readjust our ideas to the new situation. This world of ours appears to be separated by a slight and precarious margin of safety from a most singular and unexpected danger. I will endeavour in this narrative, which reproduces the original document in its necessarily somewhat fragmentary form, to lay before the reader the whole of the facts up to date, prefacing my statement by saying that, if there be any who doubt the narrative of Joyce-Armstrong, there can be no question at all as to the facts concerning Lieutenant Myrtle, R.N., and Mr. Hay Connor, who undoubtedly met their end in the manner described.|$|E

As for what you say your case is, the bizarre--that kind very seldom gets into print at all. In all our make-believe, all our pretence, how, honestly, could it? But there, this is immaterial.

60|$|Ah! dear Sarianna, I don't {{complain}} {{for myself}} of an unappreciating public--I have no reason. But, {{just for that}} reason, I complain more about Robert, only he does not hear me complain. To you I may say, that the blindness, deafness, and stupidity of the English public to Robert <b>are</b> <b>amazing.</b> Of course Milsand had 'heard his name'! Well, the contrary would have been strange. Robert is. All England can't prevent his existence, I suppose. But nobody there, except a small knot of pre-Raffaelite men, pretends to do him justice. Mr. Forster has done {{the best in the}} press. As a sort of lion, Robert has his range in society, and, for the rest, you should see Chapman's returns; while in America he's a power, a writer, a poet. He is read--he lives in the hearts of the people. 'Browning readings' here in Boston; 'Browning evenings' there. For the rest, the English hunt lions too, Sarianna, but their favourite lions are chosen among 'lords' chiefly, or 'railroad kings.' 'It's worth eating much dirt,' said an Englishman of high family and character here, 'to get to Lady ----'s soirée.' Americans will eat dirt to get to us. There's the difference. English people will come and stare at me sometimes, but physicians, dentists, who serve me and refuse their fees, artists who give me pictures, friends who give up their carriages and make other practical sacrifices, are not English--no--though English Woolner was generous about a bust. Let me be just at least.|$|E
60|$|In this {{statement}} of the case everything is put out of its true place. Mr. Hastings was not charged with receiving a lac {{and a half of}} rupees from Munny Begum, the guardian of the Nabob,--for she was not then his guardian; but he was charged with receiving a lac and a half of rupees for removing the Nabob's own mother, who was his natural guardian, and substituting this step-mother, who was a prostitute, in her place; whereas here it supposes he found her a guardian, and that she had made him a present, which alters the whole nature of the case. The case, in the recital of the charge, sets out with what every one of your Lordships knows now not to be the truth of the fact, nor the thing that in itself implies the criminality: he ought to have stated that {{in the beginning of the}} business. The suppressions in the recital <b>are</b> <b>amazing.</b> He states an inquiry having been made by the Supreme Council of Bengal respecting the conduct of the members of the last administration. That inquiry was made in consequence of the charge, and not the charge brought forward, as they would have it believed, in consequence of the inquiry. There is no mention that that inquiry had been expressly ordered by the Court of Directors; but it is stated as though it was a voluntary inquiry. Now there is always something doubtful in voluntary inquiries with regard to the people concerned. He then supposes, upon this inquiry, that to be the charge which is not the charge at all. The crime, as I have stated, consisted of two distinct parts, but both inferring the same corruption: the first, two lac of rupees taken expressly for the nomination of this woman to this place; and the other, one lac and a half of rupees, in effect for the same purpose, but under the name and color of an entertainment. The drawer of the case, finding that in the one case, namely, the two lac of rupees, the evidence was more weak, but that no justification could be set up,--finding in the other, the lac and a half of rupees, the proof strong and not to be resisted, but that some justification was to be found for it, lays aside the charge of the two lac totally; and the evidence belonging to it, which was considered as rather weak, is applied to the other charge of a lac and a half, the proof of which upon its own evidence was irresistible.|$|E
