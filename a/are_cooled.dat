5|$|Early {{versions}} of the Su-25 were equipped with two R95Sh non-afterburning turbojets, in compartments {{on either side of}} the rear fuselage. The engines, sub-assemblies and surrounding fuselage <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> by air provided by the cold air intakes on top of the engine nacelles. A drainage system collects oil, hydraulic fluid residues and fuel from the engines after flight or after an unsuccessful start. The engine control systems allows independent operation of each engine. The latest versions (Su-25T and TM) are equipped with improved R-195 engines.|$|E
5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), <b>are</b> <b>cooled,</b> the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percenage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E

50|$|Porphyritic {{rocks are}} formed when {{a column of}} rising magma <b>is</b> <b>cooled</b> in two stages.

25|$|Elemental {{phosphorus}} {{is produced}} by an electric furnace. At a high temperature, a mixture of phosphate ore, silica and carbonaceous material (coke, coal etc.) produces calcium silicate, phosphorus gas and carbon monoxide.

Alternatively, the P and CO off-gases can be burned with air to produce phosphorus pentoxide and carbon dioxide.|$|E

This is the culture that transformed the Harlem Renaissance—living differently and in style.|$|R
25|$|Gas cooled {{reactors}} <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> by a circulating inert gas, often helium in high-temperature designs, while {{carbon dioxide}} {{has been used}} in past British and French nuclear power plants. Nitrogen has also been used. Utilization of the heat varies, depending on the reactor. Some reactors run hot enough that the gas can directly power a gas turbine. Older designs usually run the gas through a heat exchanger to make steam for a steam turbine.|$|E
25|$|These {{reactors}} use {{a pressure}} vessel {{to contain the}} nuclear fuel, control rods, moderator, and coolant. They <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> and moderated by high-pressure liquid water. The hot radioactive water that leaves the pressure vessel is looped through a steam generator, which in turn heats a secondary (non-radioactive) loop of water to steam that can run turbines. They are the majority of current reactors. This is a thermal neutron reactor design, the newest of which are the VVER-1200, Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor and the European Pressurized Reactor. United States Naval reactors are of this type.|$|E
25|$|Another way to {{increase}} the yield of the reaction would be to remove the product (i.e. ammonia gas) from the system. In practice, gaseous ammonia is not removed from the reactor itself, since the temperature is too high; it {{is removed from the}} equilibrium mixture of gases leaving the reaction vessel. The hot gases <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> enough, whilst maintaining a high pressure, for the ammonia to condense and be removed as liquid. Unreacted hydrogen and nitrogen gases are then returned to the reaction vessel to undergo further reaction.|$|E

25|$|The pebble-bed reactor, a {{high-temperature}} gas-cooled reactor (HTGCR), {{is designed}} so high temperatures reduce power output by Doppler broadening of the fuel's neutron cross-section. It uses ceramic fuels so its safe operating temperatures exceed the power-reduction temperature range. Most designs <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> by inert helium. Helium {{is not subject}} to steam explosions, resists neutron absorption leading to radioactivity, and does not dissolve contaminants that can become radioactive. Typical designs have more layers (up to 7) of passive containment than light water reactors (usually3). A unique feature that may aid safety is that the fuel-balls actually form the core's mechanism, and are replaced one-by-one as they age. The design of the fuel makes fuel reprocessing expensive.|$|E
25|$|The {{filaments}} require {{constant and}} often considerable power, even when amplifying signals at the microwatt level. Power is also dissipated when the electrons from the cathode slam into the anode (plate) and heat it; this can occur {{even in an}} idle amplifier due to quiescent currents necessary to ensure linearity and low distortion. In a power amplifier, this heating can be considerable and can destroy the tube if driven beyond its safe limits. Since the tube contains a vacuum, the anodes in most small and medium power tubes <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> by radiation through the glass envelope. In some special high power applications, the anode forms part of the vacuum envelope to conduct heat to an external heat sink, usually cooled by a blower, or water-jacket.|$|E
25|$|Protium is a spin 1/2 {{subatomic}} particle {{and is therefore}} a fermion. Other fermions include neutrons, electrons, and the radioactive isotope tritium. Fermions are governed by Pauli's exclusion principle, where no two particles can have the same quantum number. However, bosons like deuterium and photons, are not bound by exclusion and multiple particles can occupy the same energy state. This fundamental difference in 1H and 2H manifests in many physical properties. Integer spin particles like deuterium follow Bose-Einstein statistics while fermions with half integer spins follow Fermi-Dirac statistics. Wave functions that describe multiple fermions must be antisymmetric with respect to swapping particles, while boson wave functions are symmetric. Because bosons are indistinguishable and can occupy the same state, collections of bosons behave very differently than fermions at colder temperatures. As bosons <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> and relaxed to the lowest energy state, phenomena like superfluidity and superconductivity occur.|$|E

25|$|The wine is {{fermented}} once on {{the barrel}} and then undergoes a second fermentation in the bottle after the addition of yeast, nutrients for the yeast, and sugar (known as tirage). The second fermentation results in a natural sparkling wine. Yeast precipitate (lees) must then be removed. This begins with riddling (remuage in French) {{which means that the}} bottles are turned with the neck downwards and lightly shaken to move the lees to the neck of the bottle. This is done in small steps where the bottle orientation gradually changes. Finally the inverted bottle necks <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> so that the precipitation freezes to a small block of ice, the bottles are turned upright and the temporary closure (normally a crown cap) is opened so that the precipitate is pushed out by the pressure in the bottle. Then the bottle is filled to replace the missing volume, and fitted with a plain Champagne cork and halter. The process to remove lees is called disgorging.|$|E

Transmission of power is by Siemens-built bogie-mounted three phase asynchronous induction type double pole pair traction motors which power the wheels via reduction gear and a hollow quill drive connected to the wheels at both ends via resilient links. The six traction motors are supplied with three-phase electrical power by gate turn-off thyristor controlled inverters using pulse-width modulation controlled by a Siemens' Sibas-32 traction control electronics. The electronic inverters <b>are</b> <b>cooled</b> by evaporated fluid, the traction motors are air cooled by external fans.|$|E
