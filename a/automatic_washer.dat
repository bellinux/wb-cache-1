5000|$|During {{the years}} that Frigidaire was owned by General Motors, it was very {{competitive}} in the automatic clothes-washing-machine business. Frigidaire engineer Kenneth Sisson, also credited with {{the design of the}} incrementing timer used on clothes washers and dishwashers for years to come, designed the Frigidaire <b>automatic</b> <b>washer</b> with the Unimatic mechanism in the late 1930s. Production of the first Frigidaire automatic clothes washers was halted due to World War II and therefore the machine was not formally introduced until 1947. The washing action of a Frigidaire automatic was unique in that the agitator pulsated up and down, a unique departure from the traditional oscillating type. The Frigidaire washers were commonly named for their mechanisms, which, in true General Motors fashion, underwent frequent changes over the years. The Unimatic was in production the longest, for any single Frigidaire mechanism, from 1947 to 1958. The Pulsamatic mechanism, unique in that it pulsated 630 times per minute, was introduced in 1955 for the lower-end models. This became the foundation for the Multimatic, introduced for the 1959 model year. The Multimatic lasted through 1964, as the Rollermatic was brought out for the 1965 lineup. The Rollermatic was unique in that instead of using an oil-filled gearcase, metal and urethane rollers transferred the power within the mechanism. This underwent a slight revision in 1970 for the new eighteen-pound capacity 1-18, which kept the same basic mechanism but differed in that it was belt-driven off of the motor and added a recirculating pump. Besides the unique action, another notable feature of these older washers was the final, high-speed spin cycle (nicknamed [...] "Rapidry"), 1140 revolutions per minute in the Unimatic, 850 in the Multimatic, and 1010 in the high-end Rollermatic models.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the disinfection procedures carried out in the Italian centers of digestive endoscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous postal questionnaire on the methods of cleaning and disinfecting endoscopy equipment in Italy was sent to 781 digestive endoscopy centers; 386 units (49. 4 %) replied. RESULTS: <b>Automatic</b> <b>washers</b> were available in 47. 6 % of units. Nearly all the respondets (99. 2 %) cleaned the instruments before disinfection, using detergent, germicidal or enzymatic cleaner, but only 69. 7 % carried out brushing.

5000|$|Bendix Home Appliances, a {{subsidiary}} of Avco, an otherwise unrelated company, who licensed the name from Bendix Corporation, introduced the first domestic automatic washing machine in 1937, having applied for a patent in the same year. In appearance and mechanical detail, this first machine was not unlike the front loading <b>automatic</b> <b>washers</b> produced today. Although it included many of the today's basic features, the machine lacked any drum suspension and therefore had to be anchored to the floor to prevent [...] "walking". Because of the components required, the machine was also very expensive. For instance, the Bendix Home Laundry Service Manual (published November 1, 1946) shows that the drum speed change was facilitated by a 2-speed gearbox built to a heavy duty standard (not unlike a car automatic gearbox, albeit at a smaller size). The timer was also probably fairly costly, because miniature electric motors were expensive to produce.|$|R

During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the company {{was one of the few}} to actually make a profit in successive years. In 1938, Maytag provoked strikes by the company's workers because of a 10% pay cut. The company was able to beat the strike because of the intervention of four military companies, including a machine gun company, of the 113th Cavalry Regiment, Iowa National Guard. At his father's death in 1940, Fred Maytag II, grandson of the founder, took over the presidency. During World War II, the company participated in war production by making special components for military equipment. In 1946, production of washing machines was resumed; in 1949, the first <b>automatic</b> <b>washers</b> were produced in a new, dedicated factory. In 1946, Maytag began marketing a separate line of ranges and refrigerators made by other companies under the Maytag name.

40|$|AbstractDisinfecting footbaths {{are used}} to treat and prevent {{interdigital}} dermatitis (ID) and heel horn erosion (HHE). However, many disinfectants are disadvantageous for the environment and, as an alternative, washing of the feet has been introduced. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} effect of water footbaths (trial 1), footbaths with CuSO 4 (trial 2), automatic water flushing (trial 3), and water flushing followed by disinfection with a glutaraldehyde-based compound (trial 4) in 4 randomized controlled clinical trials performed in a freestall dairy herd of approximately 45 Norwegian Red cows. At trimming before and after each trial, hind foot diseases, hardness of the claw horn (in D-units), locomotion, and cleanliness of the claws were recorded. Before each trial, the cows were divided in comparable study and control groups, based on prevalence of ID and HHE, parity, and days in milk. Using a transponder-regulated gate, the study groups were led through a footbath (trials 1 and 2) or an <b>automatic</b> <b>washer</b> (trials 3 and 4), whereas the control groups were left untreated. Each trial lasted 3 mo and the curative effect in diseased cows and the preventive effect in cows with healthy feet on ID, HHE, and ID + HHE were analyzed. In trial 2, a preventive effect of CuSO 4 on HHE compared with the untreated cows was observed. During trial 1, 100 % (11 / 11) of the treated cows with ID got better and 22 % (2 / 9) without ID became diseased, whereas 92 % (11 / 12) of the treated cows with ID + HHE got better and 38 % (3 / 8) without ID + HHE became diseased. During trial 2, 69 % (9 / 13) of the treated cows with ID got better and 11 % (1 / 9) without ID became diseased. During trial 4, 19 % (3 / 16) of the untreated cows with ID + HHE got better and 71 % (5 / 7) without ID + HHE became diseased. In trial 3, no significant effects on ID, HHE, or ID + HHE were revealed. In trial 2 (CuSO 4), the treated cows’ claw horn was harder after the trial compared with the controls (D-unit difference: 13. 25). In trial 3 (stationary water flushing) the treated cows’ claw horn was softer after the trial when compared with the controls (D-unit difference: − 15. 66). The CuSO 4 footbaths were useful to prevent HHE and indicate that automatic stationary flushing with only water had no beneficial effect on ID or HHE.

50|$|Just as {{the culture}} was {{spreading}} outside New York City and overseas, the cultural aspect of graffiti in New York City {{was said to}} be deteriorating {{almost to the point of}} extinction. The rapid decline in writing was due to several factors. The streets became more dangerous due to the burgeoning crack epidemic, legislation was underway to make penalties for graffiti artists more severe, and restrictions on paint sale and display made racking (stealing) materials difficult. Above all, the MTA greatly increased their anti-graffiti budget. Many favored painting sites became heavily guarded, yards were patrolled, newer and better fences were erected, and buffing of pieces was strong, heavy, and consistent. Stainless steel, to which paint adheres poorly (and was easily removed by the powerful cleaning solutions and spinning brushes used in <b>automatic</b> car <b>washers</b> at the yards) had also become the car body material of choice for new rolling stock, retiring hundreds of worn out carbon-steel bodied subway cars whose exteriors had made an ideal canvas for taggers.

5000|$|Abbey’s {{impression}} {{is that we are}} trapped by the machinations of mainstream culture. This is made apparent with quotes such as: “Yet history demonstrates that personal liberty is a rare and precious thing, that all societies tend toward the absolute until attack from without or collapse from within breaks up the social machine and makes freedom and innovation again possible." [...] He also believes the daily routine is meaningless, that we have created a life that we do not even want to live in:My God! I am thinking, what incredible shit we put up with most of our lives - the domestic routine (same old wife every night), the stupid and useless degrading jobs, the insufferable arrogance of elected officials, the crafty cheating and the slimy advertising of the business men, the tedious wars in which we kill our buddies instead of our real enemies back in the capital, the foul diseased and hideous cities and towns we live in, the constant petty tyranny of <b>automatic</b> <b>washers</b> and automobiles and TV machines and telephone!Abbey displays disdain for the way industrialization is impacting the American wilderness. He scolds humanity for the environmental duress caused by man’s blatant disregard for nature: “If industrial man, continues to multiply his numbers and expand his operations he will succeed in his apparent intention, to seal himself off from the natural, and isolate himself within a synthetic prison of his own making”. Man prioritizes material items over nature, development and expansion for the sake of development: There may be some among the readers of this book, like the earnest engineer, who believe without question that any and all forms of construction and development are intrinsic goods, in the national parks as well as anywhere else, who virtually identify quantity with quality and therefore assume that the greater the quantity of traffic, the higher the value received. There are some who frankly and boldly advocate the eradication of the last remnants of wilderness and the complete subjugation of nature to the requirements of--not man--but industry. This is a courageous view, admirable in its simplicity and power, and with the weight of all modern history behind it. It is also quite insane. I cannot attempt to deal with it here. Another example of this for Abbey is the tragedy of the commons: “A civilization which destroys what little remains of the wild, the spare, the original, is cutting itself off from its origins and betraying the principle of civilization itself. If industrial man continues to multiply its numbers and expand his operations he will succeed in his apparent intention, to seal himself off from the natural and isolate himself within a synthetic prison of his own making. He will make himself an exile from the earth”. He also criticizes what he sees as the dominant social paradigm, what he calls the expansionist view, and the belief that technology will solve all our problems: “Confusing life expectancy with life-span, the gullible begin to believe that medical science has accomplished a miracle—lengthened human life!” Abbey takes this theme to an extreme at various points of the narrative, concluding that: “Wilderness preservations like a hundred other good causes will be forgotten under the overwhelming pressure, or a struggle for mere survival and sanity in a completely urbanized completely industrialized, ever more crowded environment, for my own part I would rather take my chances in a thermonuclear war then live in such a world”.|$|R

A radiometer is an instrument used to measure radiant energy. ARM uses a pyranometer to measure the solar radiation reaching Earth's surface. Clouds, water vapor, dust, and other aerosol particles can interfere with the transmission of solar radiation. The amount of radiant energy reaching the ground depends on the type and quantity of absorbers and reflectors between the sun and Earth's surface. A pyranometer can also measure solar radiation reflected from the surface. A pyranometer has a thermoelectric device (a wire-wound, plated thermopile) that produces an electric current proportional to the broadband shortwave solar radiation reaching a detector. The detector, which is painted black, is mounted in a precision-ground glass sphere for protection from the elements. The glass must be kept very clean, because dirt and dust scatter and absorb solar radiation and make the measurement incorrect. Accurate measurements of solar radiation are needed so that scientists can accurately replicate the interactions of solar radiation and clouds in global climate models [...] a major goal of the ARM program.

It has more than 3 -fold reduced overall assay duration than the commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Moreover, it has a wide detection range i. e. 0. 3 pg/mL- 20 ng/mL and 125 -fold better analytical sensitivity than the commercial ELISA kit. The anti-HFA antibody-bound MTPs can be effectively stored in 0. 1 M PBS without any significant loss of functional activity. The developed HFA CIA is multisubstrate-compatible and can be employed for immunoassays {{on a wide range of}} commercially-relevant substrates that are being used in various biosensors/point-of-care diagnostics. ### Introduction The development of a robust, rapid and highly-sensitive immunoassay format for the precise detection of HFA is an absolute requirement for clinical disease diagnosis. HFA is a highly specific biomarker for atherosclerosis (1) and hepatocellular carcinoma (2), which is also involved in diabetes (3), cardiovascular diseases (4), arthritis, metabolism-associated syndrome (5), and malaria 6. It is a liver-derived protein that is secreted into the bloodstream in the concentration range of 450 - 600 µg/mL. The concentration of HFA changes significantly in various pathophysiological conditions (1, 7 - 9). Several immunoassay formats have been developed till date for HFA detection, which were mainly based on ELISA (10 - 11), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (12), microarray (13), and electrochemical luminescence (6). However, ELISA is still the most widely used format and the accepted clinical standard for HFA detection. But in recent years, several highly-sensitive chemiluminescent substrates, having wide detection range and improved analytical sensitivity, have been developed (14). The developed CIA (15), being the most sensitive immunoassay format for HFA detection in comparison to ELISA and SPR, can have potential applications in clinical diagnostics. APTES has been widely used for the leach-proof immobilization of biomolecules (16 - 19) as it enables high immobilization density, long-term stability, high reproducibility, and less biofouling. It has been extensively employed for the development of continuous glucose monitoring systems (20 - 22). In the present study, the covalent crosslinking of antibodies in a leach-proof manner on APTES-functionalized bioanalytical platform leads to higher functional antibody immobilization density that results in highly sensitive analyte detection. ### Reagents 1.
