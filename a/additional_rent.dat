40|$|The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) {{has imposed}} {{a price on}} the {{allowances}} for CO 2 emissions of electricity companies. Integrating this allowance price into the price of electricity earns a rent for companies who have received these allowances for free. During Phase I, 2005 - 2007, rents corresponding to the aggregate value of allocated allowances amounted to roughly [euro] 13 billion per year. However, due to the specific price-setting mechanism in electricity markets true rents were considerably higher. This {{is due to the}} fact that companies also that have not received any allowances gain <b>additional</b> infra-marginal <b>rents</b> to the extent that their variable costs are below the new market price after inclusion of the allowance price. Producers with low carbon emissions and low marginal costs thus also benefit substantially from carbon pricing. This paper develops a methodology to determine the specific interaction of the imposition of such a CO 2 constraint and the price-setting mechanism in the electricity sector under the assumption of marginal cost pricing in a liberalized European electricity market. The article thus provides an empirical estimate of the true total rents of power producers during Phase I of the EU-ETS (2005 - 2007). The EU ETS generated in Phase I <b>additional</b> <b>rents</b> in excess of [euro] 19 billion per year for electricity producers. These transfers are distributed very unevenly between different electricity producers. In a second step, the paper assesses the impact of switching from free allocation to an auctioning of allowances in 2013. We show that such a switch to auctioning will continue to create <b>additional</b> infra-marginal <b>rents</b> for certain producers and will leave the electricity sector as a whole better off than before the introduction of the EU ETS.

50|$|One {{difficulty}} is finding suitable roommates. Living with a roommate can mean much less privacy {{than having a}} residence of one's own, and for some people this can {{cause a lot of}} stress. Another thing to consider when choosing a roommate is how to divide the cost of living. Who pays for what, or are the shared expenses divided between the two or more roommates. Also, the potential roommate should be trusted to pay their share and trusted to pay it on time. Sleeping patterns can also be disrupted when living with a number of people. Some of the challenges that come with share housing may include advertising for, interviewing and choosing potential housemates; sharing communal household goods, rent (often this may be determined by the size or position of respective bedrooms); sharing household bills and grocery costs; and sharing housework, cleaning, and cooking responsibilities. Conflicts may arise if, for example, residents have different standards of cleanliness, different diets, or different hours of employment or study. Guests and partners may also begin to board frequently, which can raise complications pertaining to utility expenses, <b>additional</b> <b>rent</b> and further possible cleaning duties. Often when these responsibilities go untended, friction may result between co-tenants. For this reason, responsibilities should be delegated and fairly assigned as early as possible in any living arrangement with roommates. A clear and defined list of alternating chores and bill lists are easy to see and enforce.|$|E

The settlement also includes four additional administrative complaints filed with DFEH. The lawsuits filed in Orange County Superior Court on behalf of two residents, and the administrative complaints filed on behalf of six additional residents, alleged the companies failed to accommodate tenants with mental health disabilities by taking steps to discourage tenants from keeping emotional support animals as a reasonable accommodation for their disabilities. The companies charged pet deposits and pet rent, imposed breed and size restrictions for legitimate support animals, and failed to engage in an interactive process to verify that tenants had genuine disabilities. The firms also lacked a uniform reasonable accommodation policy and failed to train their leasing professionals at their apartment communities about fair housing responsibilities toward people with disabilities. As a result, some tenants were evicted from their apartments or had their lease offers revoked. Others were forced to pay <b>additional</b> <b>rent.</b> In addition to paying compensation to plaintiffs and reimbursing DFEH for attorneys’ fees, the companies have also agreed to adopt a comprehensive reasonable accommodation policy, provide training to employees, and hire a Compliance Manager to review requests for reasonable accommodation. “We are pleased that The Irvine Co. cooperated with us to achieve this settlement, which compensates the plaintiffs and complainants for the harm they suffered and contains equitable relief designed {{to ensure that all}} tenants and applicants with disabilities will receive equal housing opportunities, including reasonable accommodations, as required by law,” said Kevin Kish, Director of DFEH. The Settlement Agreement also clarifies the right of the companies to request reliable third-party verification to show the need for a service animal. It also clarifies that ID cards, certificates for a “registered service animal” or online services providing “ESA prescription” letters for sale are not sufficient verification.|$|E

Our analysis of dyadic {{data collected from}} 91 buyer–supplier logistics relationships finds that buyer and supplier strategic information flows positively impact the relationship-specific performance of both sharing and receiving parties. Specifically, each party gains financially from improved management of assets, reduced costs of operations, and enhanced productivity.

Additionally, buyer IT customization and both buyer and sup plier trusting beliefs in the receiving party positively impact strategic information sharing with partners. This study suggests that partnerships for supply chain services engage in cooperative initiatives to generate relational rents and are an alternative to conventional “arms length” transactional exchanges. These partnerships need to be motivated {{to go beyond the}} sharing of order-related information (which must occur in transactional exchanges) and to share strategic information (which has the potential for both <b>additional</b> <b>rent</b> generation and risks of misappropriation) ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Urban Land Development) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. Green {{building}} {{is not a}} new concept; however, the government making it a requirement is. The State of California is once again the first to mandate green building through its state building code. CALGreen requires all new construction to follow a minimum set of green building measures and provides additional green building measures that are voluntary, unless a jurisdiction mandates them. This thesis is a cost/benefit analysis of constructing a proposed office building to meet the mandatory and/or voluntary CALGreen requirements at 10799 International Drive. The extra initial costs totaled 1. 088 percent, 5. 292 percent, and 22. 304 percent above the baseline building for the mandatory CALGreen, voluntary Tier 1, and voluntary Tier 2 buildings, respectively. The quantifiable private benefits originated from utility savings by creating lower operating expenses in the base year, higher property values, and <b>additional</b> <b>rent.</b> The private benefits from the utility savings totaled 21, 157 for the mandatory CALGreen building, 167, 670 for the CALGreen Tier 1 building, and 348, 584 for the CALGreen Tier 2 building. The extra initial costs and associated benefits resulted in negative results of the net present value, internal rate of return, and discounted payback period for all three green building levels of CALGreen.

The foal had been inappetent and pawing at her hay {{in the morning and}} a few hours later was sweating, kicking at her abdomen and rolling. On presentation, the foal was quiet and slightly depressed but was not trying to kick or roll. Vital signs were all within normal limits and physical exam was unremarkable aside from decreased gut sounds in all four quadrants. Point of care abdominal ultrasound revealed distended, amotile small intestine but a small stomach and no obvious foreign body or intussusception. Overnight, the foal had a few episodes of discomfort and rolling. Fluid obtained from abdominocentesis was abnormal, but changes were not significant enough to warrant emergency surgery. Abdominal ultrasound the next morning revealed further distended loops of bowel filled with fluid and live ascarids. The foal was taken to surgery for a suspected ascarid impaction; however, exploratory laparotomy revealed a small loop of jejunum entrapped in a diaphragmatic rent. A resection and anastomosis was performed on the affected area of jejunum and the diaphragmatic rent repaired. On the 11 th day post-op, the foal showed signs of colic which were not able to be alleviated with pain medication and the foal was euthanized.

This research project drew on individual client case records and interviews with professionals working in the Assistance with Care and Housing for the Aged (ACHA) program.  The program is designed to assist disadvantaged older people who are at risk of homelessness or who are homeless. Those with a conventional housing history who faced homelessness were typically renters, and faced critical housing incidents such as being served a Notice to Vacate or family breakdown, or faced a lack of affordable housing options. Some also lived in housing with inappropriate design, making it unsafe to continue their residency. Key intervention strategies used to resettle older people were found to include: 	Assessing an individual’s circumstances, needs and goals at initial contact (using a person-centred and holistic framework). 	Investigating whether the residency can be maintained through use of advocacy, negotiation with landlords, and brokerage of services. 	Providing affordable or accessible housing options such as social housing, private housing or caravan parks where the older person can maintain a long term tenancy. 	Providing supports to assist the older person to remain independent in the community or providing practical assistance such as whitegoods and assistance with moving. An essential component in all circumstances is access to housing. However there is a shortage of affordable and appropriate stock, particularly the private rental market, to facilitate older people ageing in place. Transitional or long-term <b>additional</b> <b>rent</b> subsidies for private renters may make it a more sustainable tenure.  Landlords could also help sustain tenancies for older people by permitting modifications to their properties. The breakdown in intergenerational family housing arrangements and its link with homelessness might be addressed by better understanding the role of carer stress, overcrowding, tension, conflict or elder abuse in the development of housing crises.  Additional resources or the provision of alternative family housing may also serve to prevent these relationship breakdowns...|$|E

But even in this case, if performance is sufficiently weak the manager will forfeit eligibility for a bonus, and again take on disaster risk. When effort costs are convex, reductions in effort incentives are used to limit risk taking, with a jump to high powered incentives in the gambling region. Our model can explain why suboptimal risk taking can emerge even when investors are fully rational and managers are compensated optimally...|$|R
