5|$|All these {{distributions}} have no or {{only minor}} changes {{when compared with}} the original FreeBSD base system. The main difference to the original FreeBSD is that they come with pre-installed and pre-configured software for specific use cases. This can be compared with Linux distributions, which are all binary compatible because they use the same kernel and <b>also</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> same basic tools, compilers and libraries, while coming with different applications, configurations and branding.|$|E
5|$|Both the Church of Satan and the Temple of Set <b>also</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> {{trapezoid}} symbol. The version {{used by the}} Church includes flames, a pitchfork and {{the number}} 666, while the trapezoid of the Temple has a left-facing Egyptian sceptre, and the number 666 stylized in geometric shapes rather than as clear numbers.|$|E
5|$|Certain non-inhibitory serpins <b>also</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> serpin {{conformational}} change {{as part of}} their function. For example, the native (S) form of thyroxine-binding globulin has high affinity for thyroxine, whereas the cleaved (R) form has low affinity. Similarly, transcortin has higher affinity for cortisol when in its native (S) state, than its cleaved (R) state. Thus, in these serpins, RCL cleavage and the S to R transition has been commandeered to allow for ligand release, rather than protease inhibition.|$|E

5|$|On 29 September 1931, barely {{two weeks}} after the British team had secured the Schneider Trophy outright, Flight Lieutenant George Stainforth broke the world {{airspeed}} record in a Rolls-Royce R-powered Supermarine S.6B, serial S1595, reaching an average speed of 407.5mph (655.67km/h). It had been intended to <b>also</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> identical sister aircraft, S1596, for the attempt but Stainforth had capsized it on 16 September whilst testing a propeller.|$|E
5|$|The Paladin is the game's hub. Between missions, {{players can}} {{interact}} with crew {{members on the}} ship and view the game's objectives. Crew members also offer the protagonist side missions to complete.

5|$|A common snack in Africa is Koki or Moyin-Moyin, {{where the}} cowpeas are mashed into a paste and then wrapped in banana leaves. They <b>also</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> cowpea paste as a {{supplement}} in infant formula when weaning babies off milk. Slaves brought to America and the West Indies cooked cowpeas {{much the same way}} as they did in Africa, although many people in the American South considered cowpeas not suitable for human consumption. A popular dish was Hoppin' John, which contained black-eyed peas cooked with rice and seasoned with pork. Over time cowpeas became more universally accepted and now Hoppin' John is seen as a traditional Southern dish ritually served on New Year's Day.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{airport site}} to Gardermoen was proposed at Hurum, south-west of Oslo. Had Hurum been chosen, the Gardermoen Line {{would not have}} been necessary for the airport express train, but the planning documents recommended that construction still proceed to ease traffic congestion north of Oslo. The tunnel is used by all trains on the Gardermoen Line, including the Flytoget airport express, and the regional and express trains which continue via the Dovre Line. Local trains on the Hoved Line and Kongsvinger Line to the north <b>also</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> tunnel. Use of the Hoved Line is limited to freight trains and commuter trains which make stops along the route.|$|E
5|$|Blacklist has platform-specific features, {{including}} voice {{integration with}} Xbox 360's Kinect peripheral which allows players to distract enemies before attacking. A player can <b>also</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Kinect sensor {{to control the}} protagonist with their body instead of the Xbox 360 controller. In the Wii U version, the Gamepad controller's touchscreen is an interface, accessing gadgets and other features from the protagonist's arm-mounted computer (OPSAT), and incorporating screen and motion controls to highlight enemies with thermal vision when using Killing in Motion. The Wii U version was not shipped with the game's cooperative mode.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the switch}} to 3D, the game is still played {{primarily}} from an overhead perspective similar to the original 2D Metal Gear games. However, the camera angle will change during certain situations, such as a corner view when Snake flattens himself to a wall next to an open space, or into first-person when crawling under tight spaces or using certain items such as the binoculars or a sniper rifle. The player can <b>also</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> first-person view while remaining idle to look around Snake's surroundings or see what's ahead of him.|$|E

With {{the help of a}} Game Link Cable, two players can link together and compete in four different types of deathmatch modes, ranging from the standard kill-the-other-person on a pre-set time to the Counter Force mode, where the first player must rescue two hostages while the second player has to guard them. Various multiplayer maps are unlocked as the player progresses through the single player mode. Additionally, {{with the use of the}} optional Transfer Pak, players can use the game's cartridge to alternatively unlock some cheats in its Nintendo 64 counterpart. Players may <b>also</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Game Boy Printer to print out character profiles.|$|E
5|$|Insects are {{the only}} {{invertebrates}} to have developed active flight capability, and this has {{played an important role}} in their success. Their muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible. Having their muscles attached to their exoskeletons is more efficient and allows more muscle connections; crustaceans <b>also</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> same method, though all spiders use hydraulic pressure to extend their legs, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. Unlike insects, though, most aquatic crustaceans are biomineralized with calcium carbonate extracted from the water.|$|E
5|$|Metroid: Other M is {{the first}} game in the Metroid series to feature melee attacks. With well-timed button presses, players can use special techniques, such as the Sense Move, which allows them to dodge enemy attacks, and the Overblast, where Samus jumps on the enemy and fires a charged shot at point-blank range. Unlike other Metroid games, enemies do not drop items, with the {{restoration}} of health and ammo occurring either by using the Navigation Booths, or employing of the Concentration technique, where Samus rests and replenishes missiles and health. Players can <b>also</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Navigation Booths to save their progress. While there are power-ups scattered around the Bottle Ship, a few items are already equipped by Samus, but she agrees to wait to use them until commanding officer Adam Malkovich authorizes her to do so. Players can find items that will augment Samus's abilities, such as Energy and Missile Tanks.|$|E
