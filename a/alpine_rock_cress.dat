On the Pyrenees limited genetic variability was already documented; on the Alps a number of populations display a decreasing census size. We analyzed sequence variation in the mitochondrial DNA D-loop for 148 individuals and ten microsatellite loci for 152 individuals in order to investigate evolutionary history, levels of genetic variability and structure of <b>alpine</b> <b>rock</b> ptarmigan.

40|$|Over 280 lichens and bryophytes were {{recorded}} during a botanical survey of Mount Sprent. The {{number of species}} is approximately twice that of the vascular species (136 species) and demonstrates the importance of lichens and bryophyles in assessing the botmical significance of the area. Six species, Calil/aria contristans, Ochrolechia androgyna, Polychidiurn contorturn, Thelotrerna suecicum, Acromastigum verticale and Tylimanthus diversifolius are reported from Tasmania for the first time. Many of the species recorded are widespread in the high rainfall parts of Tasmania, but a significant number are confined mainly to the west.
