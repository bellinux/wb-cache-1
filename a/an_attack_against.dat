5|$|In December 1914, the German navy {{carried out}} {{attacks on the}} British coastal towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby. The attack {{resulted}} in 137 fatalities and 593 casualties, {{many of which were}} civilians. The attack made the German navy very unpopular with the British public, as <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> British civilians in their homes. Likewise, the British Royal Navy was criticised for failing to prevent the raid.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, late on 13 February, having {{successfully}} regrouped what forces {{he could}} muster at Bergères-lès-Vertus, Blücher had launched <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> Marmont's single division, pushing {{him out of}} Étoges and advancing as planned towards Champaubert and Fromentières, {{in the rear of}} Napoleon's force. However, having read Blücher's intentions, Napoleon had given orders for a concentration of French forces in that very sector.|$|E

5|$|Although de Lacy {{had spent}} time at Stephen's court, {{during the civil}} war that {{occurred}} during Stephen's reign, he switched sides and served Stephen's rival, Matilda the Empress. In 1138, he was besieged by the king at Weobley along with his cousin Geoffrey Talbot, but both men escaped when the king took the castle in June. De Lacy also led an army in <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> Bath {{in the service of the}} Empress, along with Geoffrey Talbot, which also occurred in 1138 and which some historians have seen as the opening act of the civil war.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the third}} stage of General Sir Herbert Plumer's Passchendaele offensive, <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> Broodseinde was {{scheduled}} for 4 October 1917. The 3rd Australian Division's 10th Australian Infantry Brigade {{was one of the}} assault formations charged with delivering the main blow, and ultimately with seizing the heavily defended Broodseinde Ridge. To provide defence against low-flying German aircraft during the attack, a group of 24 men, including Peeler, from the 3rd Pioneer Battalion's machine gun section were attached to the 10th Brigade's 37th Battalion.|$|E
5|$|At {{a session}} of the Arab League's Joint Defence Council on January 27–30, 1973, Egypt {{presented}} a report stressing that <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> Israel {{would have to be}} carried out simultaneously from Egypt, Syria and Jordan because of the Israeli air superiority. According to the report, Egypt and Syria's air forces, if reinforced with 16 air squadrons from other Arab countries would achieve numerical superiority. However, the Israelis offset this by superior training, avionics, aircraft payload and weaponry. A simultaneous Arab attack could dilute the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), and would force Israeli ground forces to fight a two-front war.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1991, Jashari {{participated in}} {{attacks against the}} Serbian police before {{travelling}} to Albania to receive military training. Arrested in 1993, he was released {{at the behest of}} the Albanian Army and later returned to Kosovo, where he continued launching attacks against the Yugoslav establishment. In July 1997, he was convicted of terrorism in absentia by a Yugoslav court. After several unsuccessful attempts to capture or kill him, Serbian police launched <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> Jashari's home in Prekaz in March 1998. The battle that followed resulted in the deaths of 58 members of Jashari's family, including that of Jashari, his wife, brother and son.|$|E
5|$|Following the Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Popovac joined the Chetnik movement of Draža Mihailović. Popovac was {{a proponent of}} Bosnian Muslim cooperation with the Chetniks and suggested that they recruit Muslims into their ranks. In October 1942, he enlisted Italian aid in fighting the communist Partisans, and later visited Prozor to discourage further bloodshed after a Chetnik massacre that took the lives {{of as many as}} 2,500 Muslim and Croat civilians. In early 1943, he led <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> a Muslim village. Later that year, he was killed in disputed circumstances near the town of Trebinje.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Muhammad {{organized}} <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> northern Arabia {{because of their}} previous defeat at the Battle of Mu'tah and reports of hostility adopted against Muslims. With great difficulty he assembled 30,000 men; half of whom {{on the second day}} returned with Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy, untroubled by the damning verses which Muhammad hurled at them. Although Muhammad did not engage with hostile forces at Tabuk, he received the submission of some local chiefs of the region.|$|E

5|$|Michael VIII countered the {{emerging}} threat by a diplomatic {{mission to the}} Papacy, which in the Second Council of Lyon (1274) agreed to the union of the Orthodox and Catholic churches, estranged after the Great Schism of 1054, and thereby placed Michael and his empire under papal protection. Taking advantage of Charles's entanglement in the conflict between Guelphs and Ghibellines in Italy, in spring 1274 Michael launched <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> Angevin holdings in Albania. Berat and Buthrotum were taken and Charles's troops were pushed back from the hinterland to the two ports of Valona and Dyrrhachium. Although these were assaulted several times in 1274–1275, they remained in Angevin hands.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1918, Maxwell {{commanded}} a scouting patrol that was operating {{to the east}} of Ploegsteert. Having obtained the required information, he ordered the patrol to withdraw. He and three of his men were covering the withdrawal of the main body when he noticed about thirty Germans nearby. Recalling the patrol, he led <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> the party, which had sheltered in an old trench; the Germans quickly withdrew, leaving three dead and one wounded prisoner of war. Maxwell was awarded the Military Cross for his actions during this engagement, news of which was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 13 May 1918.|$|E
5|$|Parthian {{enterprise}} in the West {{began in the}} time of Mithridates I and was revived by Mithridates II, who negotiated unsuccessfully with Lucius Cornelius Sulla for a RomanParthian alliance (c.105BC).* Mackay (2004), 149; Sherwin-White (1994), 262 When Lucullus invaded Southern Armenia and led <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> Tigranes in 69BC, he corresponded with Phraates III to dissuade him from intervening. Although the Parthians remained neutral, Lucullus considered attacking them.* Sherwin-White (1994), 262–263 In 6665BC, Pompey reached agreement with Phraates, and RomanParthian troops invaded Armenia, but a dispute soon arose over the Euphrates boundary. Finally, Phraates asserted his control over Mesopotamia, except for the western district of Osroene, which became a Roman dependency.|$|E

5|$|The Australians spent Christmas Day patrolling {{forward in}} concert with Royal Australian Air Force Boomerang fighters from No. 4 Squadron RAAF {{carrying}} out reconnaissance flights ahead of their position. Throughout the evening, the Japanese launched <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> one of the Australian companies, but this was turned back by the defenders. For several days, the Australian battalion commander formulated a plan to capture Pearl Ridge, possession of which would enable the Australians to block Japanese attempts to approach the main Allied base around Torokina, and would disrupt the movement of Japanese troops along the north–south axis of the island, hindering their ability to reinforce isolated pockets.|$|E
5|$|Unknown {{to either}} side at Saratoga, General Lincoln and Colonel John Brown had staged <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> the British {{position}} at Fort Ticonderoga. Lincoln had collected 2,000 men at Bennington by early September. Brown and a detachment of 500 men captured poorly defended positions between Ticonderoga and Lake George, and then spent several days ineffectually bombarding the fort. These men, {{and some of the}} prisoners they freed along the way, were back in the American camp by September 29.|$|E
5|$|A last {{group of}} Romanian units left the UNR {{and headed for}} Kishinev, where a Romanian-friendly Moldavian Democratic Republic was vying for power with the local Bolsheviks. Their action was likely coordinated with the Romanian High Command, {{which at the time}} had began <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>against</b> the western Bessarabian town of Ungheni. The volunteers had dressed as Russian {{soldiers}} during their passage to Iași, but were recognized as Romanian units by the Moldavian and Bolshevik troops garrisoned in Kishinev City Station, where their train stopped on January 6. A skirmish followed, with the Moldavians and Bolsheviks either disarming, or killing or kidnapping Corps soldiers. The survivors were held captive in the same place as Moldavian Army founder Gherman Pântea, and were released later that day, allegedly by Republican troops. Years later, suspicion arose that Pântea had in fact helped the Bolsheviks, as an alleged enemy of Romanian interests in Bessarabia.|$|E
