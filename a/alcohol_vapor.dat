40|$|Experiments with plasma jets over {{surfaces}} of liquids have been made. Jets {{are created by}} the plasmadynamic and erosive discharges over alcohol. Experiments on application of the plasmadynamic discharge (plasma jet) to <b>alcohol</b> <b>vapors</b> inflammation were formulated arranged and undertaken. It was revealed that plasma jets injected into flows conserve high values of plasma temperature and plasma density at long distances from the plasma source. This allows to them to be a reliable source of vapors ignition on a surface of a flammable liquid both in immobile air and airflow. In experiments with the plasma dynamicdischarge realization over a fluid (alcohol and alcohol- water mixture) in the subsonic airflow was realized the ignition of <b>alcohol</b> <b>vapors.</b> In experiments with the erosive capillary discharge over a fluid (alcohol) in the subsonic airflow was realized an ignition of <b>vapors</b> of <b>alcohol.</b> At that experiments of measurements of air velocity have been undertaken.

50|$|The typical {{making of}} a grole is, per person, a cup of coffee, a small glass of liquor (orange/lime liquors are recommended) and 2 spoons of sugar. The coffee is poured first, then the liquor is slowly added as to not mix with the coffee. The alcohol is then {{inflamed}} using a spoon of sugar ignited with some liquor, as for drinking flamed absinthe, adding a caramel flavor to the mixture. The very hot liquid is sipped {{one person at a}} time, thus <b>alcohol</b> <b>vapors</b> are inhaled in the process.|$|R
5000|$|Preparation is now complete. The drinker {{first downs}} the shot or drinks {{it through a}} straw.

Finally, the drinker uses the straw to suck up the spirits which have collected in the saucer. The combination of ingested and inhaled alcohol makes this drink extremely potent.

5000|$|Methanol, isopropanol, {{or other}} <b>alcohol</b> <b>vapor</b> {{saturates}} the chamber. The alcohol falls as it cools {{down and the}} cold condenser provides a steep temperature gradient. The result is a supersaturated environment. As energetic charged particles pass through the gas they leave ionization trails.

This occurs because alcohol and water molecules are polar, resulting in a net attractive force toward a nearby free charge. The result is cloud formation, seen in the cloud chamber by the presence of droplets falling down to the condenser. Since the tracks are emitted radially out from the source, their point of origin can easily be determined. (See Fig. 2. for example.) ...|$|E

5000|$|There are {{possible}} {{health and safety}} risks of inhaling <b>alcohol</b> <b>vapor.</b> Inhalation devices make it [...] "substantially easier to overdose on alcohol" [...] than drinking, because the alcohol bypasses the stomach and liver and goes directly into the bloodstream, and because the user {{does not have a}} reliable way of determining how much alcohol they have taken in. Inhaled alcohol cannot be purged from the body by vomiting, which is the body's main protection against alcohol poisoning. Inhaled alcohol can dry out nasal passages and make them more susceptible to infection. There is also a potential increased risk of addiction.|$|E

50|$|The Halimeter is {{manufactured}} by Interscan Corp. in California, {{and based on}} their earlier model 1170 portable sulfide monitor. This was the model used in the two original studies. These studies, conducted {{for the first time}} by Dr. Mel Rosenberg, showed a significant correlation between monitor levels and oral malodor scores. The small size, simplicity of use, and price (relative to gas chromatograph) of the Halimeter made it popular among dentists seeking to diagnose and treat bad breath, as well as scientific researchers. Much of the published research on bad breath over the past dozen years has employed this instrument. The electrochemical sensor is sensitive to <b>alcohol</b> <b>vapors,</b> and requires recalibration over time. The Halimeter has been the only VSC monitor for the diagnosis of halitosis for years, but now that its patent has expired, it faces competition from other sulfur monitors recently introduced into the marketplace.|$|R

50|$|One {{important}} {{application of}} the Marangoni effect is the use for drying silicon wafers after a wet processing step during the manufacture of integrated circuits. Liquid spots left on the wafer surface can cause oxidation that damages components on the wafer. To avoid spotting, an <b>alcohol</b> <b>vapor</b> (IPA) or other organic compound in gas, vapor, or aerosol form is blown through a nozzle over the wet wafer surface (or at the meniscus formed between the cleaning liquid and wafer as the wafer is lifted from an immersion bath), and the subsequent Marangoni effect causes a surface-tension gradient in the liquid allowing gravity more easily to pull the liquid completely off the wafer surface, effectively leaving a dry wafer surface.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} {{divisions}} that categorize types of UFPs. UFPs can either be carbon-based or metallic, and then can be further subdivided by their magnetic properties. Electron microscopy and special physical lab conditions allow scientists to observe UFP morphology. Airborne UFPs can be measured using a condensation particle counter, in which particles are mixed with <b>alcohol</b> <b>vapor</b> and then cooled allowing the vapor to condense around them which are then counted using a light scanner. UFPs are both manufactured and naturally occurring. UFPs are the main constituent of airborne particulate matter. Due to their numerous quantity and ability to penetrate deep within the lung, UFPs are a major concern for respiratory exposure and health.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the relationship between phospholipid molecular structures and their olfactory responses to odorants, we designed and synthesized four phosphatidylcholine analogues with different long hydrocarbon (CH) chains and selected three natural phospholipids with different head-groups. By using interdigital electrodes (IEs) as olfactory sensors (OSs), we measured the responses of the Ifs coated with these seven different lipid membranes to four <b>alcohol</b> <b>vapors</b> in a gas flow system. The Ifs voltage changes were recorded and the voltage-relative saturate vapor pressure (V-P/P degrees) curves were also plotted. It was found that with a methyl (-CH 3) placed at the C- 8 position in the 18 -carbon chain, the olfactory responses could be improved about ten times and with conjugated double bonds (C=C) in the long chains, the sensitivity could be increased by 3 similar to 4 orders of magnitude. As to head-groups, choline is preferred over ethanolamine and serine in phospholipid structures in terms of high olfactory sensitivity: These results are expected to be useful in further designing and manufacturing lipid-mimicking OSs.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} calcination temperature on the gas sensitive properties of nanocrystalline tin oxide thin film. Nanocrystalline SnO 2 thin films were prepared by sol-gel method using inorganic salt as aprecursor material. Influence of calcination temperature was evaluated on the structural morphology and electrical characteristic of the film prepared by spin coating method. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed that with increasing calcination temperature the uniformity of the film increased. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements showed that the grain size increased from ∼ 20 to 80 nm as the calcination temperature was increased from 100 to 600 "C. In general, the preferred direction of smaller grain size is (110). At lower calcination temperatures, both the SnO 2 peak and the SnO peaks were seen on XRD but only SnO 2 peaks were observed at higher temperatures. The sensitivity of the tin oxide thin film to 500 ppm of <b>alcohol</b> <b>vapors</b> at the substrate temperature of 350 "C was also grain size dependent.
