5|$|Although there <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> {{staging systems}} for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none {{have been shown}} to be useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E
5|$|The {{status of}} certain {{varieties}} in the Mongolic group—whether they are languages distinct from Mongolian or just dialects of it—is disputed. There <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> such varieties: Oirat (including the Kalmyk variety) and Buryat, {{both of which}} are spoken in Russia, Mongolia, and China; and Ordos, spoken around Inner Mongolia's Ordos City.|$|E
5|$|Long and slender, {{the blue}} whale's body can be various shades of bluish-grey dorsally and {{somewhat}} lighter underneath. There <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> distinct subspecies: B. m. musculus of the North Atlantic and North Pacific, B. m. intermedia of the Southern Ocean and B. m. brevicauda (also {{known as the}} pygmy blue whale) found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean. B. m. indica, found in the Indian Ocean, may be another subspecies. As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost exclusively of small crustaceans known as krill.|$|E

5|$|The {{surface of}} Thebe {{is dark and}} appears to be reddish in color. There is a {{substantial}} asymmetry between leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavate a bright material (probably ice) from the interior of the moon. The surface of Thebe is heavily cratered and it appears that there <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> or four impact craters that are very large, each being roughly comparable in size to Thebe itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} genetically {{discrete}} subpopulations {{have been identified}} across the northern range of the Pacific angelshark. Several subpopulations exist along the coast from Point Conception northward to Alaska. In the Southern California Bight, there <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> separate subpopulations off the mainland and northern and southern Channel Islands. The subpopulation along the Pacific coast of Baja California are distinct {{from those in the}} Gulf of California. These subpopulations have diverged from one another over time because Pacific angelsharks do not undertake long migratory movements outside of their preferred home areas, and deep waters serve as effective geographical barriers to population mixing. Heterozygosity, a measure of genetic diversity, is higher in the Pacific angelshark than in other shark species that have been examined.|$|E
5|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the body has no cuticle but consists of a ciliated and glandular epithelium containing rhabdites, which form the mucus in which the cilia glide. Each ciliated cell has many cilia and microvilli. The outermost layer rests on a thickened basement membrane, the dermis. Next to the dermis <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>three</b> layers of muscles, some circular and some longitudinal. The combinations of muscle types vary between the different classes, {{but these are not}} associated with differences in movement. Nemerteans also have dorso-ventral muscles, which flatten the animals, especially in the larger species. Inside the concentric tubes of these layers is mesenchyme, a kind of connective tissue. In pelagic species this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant.|$|E
