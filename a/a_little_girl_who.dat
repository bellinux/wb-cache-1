5|$|Apart {{from the}} six crew members, {{a total of}} 160 {{passengers}} were on board {{at the time of}} the crash. Although there were 169 names on the original passenger list, nine did not board the flight. All the bodies were recovered from the wreckage. Karnataka Home Minister V. S. Acharya said eight people were initially reported to have survived, although one person died of his injuries—this was however refuted by an Air India spokesman who confirmed that all initial survivors were alive. This confusion arose after fire fighters rescued <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> died on the way to hospital.

It follows <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who's</b> lured away from her nanny by anthropomorphic insects.

25|$|It is also {{worthy of}} note that the Dorothy of the books is only <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> is no older than twelve-years-old. However, she is mature and very resourceful, only crying when faced with {{ultimate}} despair, whereas the older Dorothy of the movie (portrayed as a twelve-year-old by sixteen-year-old Judy Garland) spends several portions of the film crying and being told by others what to do, however her fear was overshadowed by the Cowardly Lion's. This is more consistent with Thompson's portrayal of Dorothy—Baum {{is known for his}} strong and independent female characters.|$|E

It features scenes of Ochi in a Western-style prairie, standing in wooden farming structures {{and next to}} a windpump.

25|$|On May 1, 1947, {{hundreds}} of mostly poor peasants gathered at Portella della Ginestra, three {{kilometers from the}} town of Piana degli Albanesi on the way to San Giuseppe Jato for the traditional international Labour Day parade. At 10:15, the Communist party secretary from Piana degli Albanesi began to address the crowd when gunfire broke out. It was later determined that machine guns had been fired from the surrounding hills, as well as by men on horseback. Eleven people were killed, including four children, Serafino Lascari (15), Giovanni Grifò (12), Giuseppe Di Maggio and Vincenzo La Fata, both seven years old. Thirty-three people were wounded, including <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> had her jaw shot off.|$|E
500|$|In a 1984 {{interview}} Farmer {{discussed the}} song's lyrics, stating: [...] "It {{can happen to}} many children who are in hospital [...] the nurses feed these children, tuck them into bed, kiss them before they sleep and therefore {{take the place of}} their mothers. So it is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> tells her mother: I love the nurse". She said in another interview: [...] "But if people prefer to give this song a perverse sense, it is their problem". Thus, she does not confirm the lesbian allusions that seem to emerge from the chorus (the French verb [...] "aimer" [...] can mean either [...] "to love" [...] or [...] "to like"). However, the song has been listed in several books dealing with homosexuality and explains the fact that many gay people were immediately attracted to Farmer's world.|$|E

500|$|Barbauld {{demanded that}} her father teach her the {{classics}} and after much pestering, he did. Thus she {{had the opportunity to}} learn Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and many other subjects generally deemed unsuitable for women at the time. Barbauld's penchant for study worried her mother, who expected her to end up a spinster because of her intellectualism; the two were never as close as Barbauld and her father. Yet Barbauld's mother was proud of her accomplishments and in later years wrote of her daughter: [...] "I once indeed knew <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> was as eager to learn as her instructors could be to teach her, and who at two years old could read sentences and little stories in her wise book, roundly, without spelling; and in half a year more could read as well as most women; but I never knew such another, and I believe never shall." ...|$|E

Her father sold his ancestral land to educate her, and worked double shifts to continue to pay for her schooling. In an interview he related that as a youth he had dreamed of becoming a school teacher, but at that time education was not considered important and girls were not even sent to school. [...] "Attitudes are changing back home now, but when I left 30 years ago, I vowed never deny my children so sending them to school was fulfilling my desire for knowledge." [...] He said that he put his daughter's education above that of even his two sons. [...] "It never entered our hearts to ever discriminate.

The woman in red transforms into the demon Mephisto, who tells Peter he can save Aunt May. As payment, Mephisto wants not Peter's soul, but his marriage to Mary Jane. Peter and Mary Jane are given until midnight the following night to decide their answer and, after several hours agonizing over the choice, they agree to the deal, as long as knowledge of Peter's secret identity is erased from the world. Mary Jane also whispers to Mephisto another, unspecified offer in return for Mephisto putting Peter's life back exactly how it was and [...] " [...] him a chance at happiness." [...] Finally, Mephisto reveals to the couple that his disguise as the little girl was in fact their future daughter, but she will never exist because of their decision. [...] This future daughter is {{not to be confused with}} May [...] "Mayday" [...] Parker (Spider-Girl). [...] May [...] "Mayday" [...] Parker is the baby that Peter Parker and Mary Jane had at the end of the Clone Saga from the 1990s and would grow up to be Spider-Girl if Norman Osborn never killed her.|$|E
500|$|By {{the start}} of the 1890s, Lloyd had built up a {{successful}} catalogue of songs, which included [...] "What's That For, Eh?", about <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> asks her parents the meaning of various everyday household objects. Her biographer and theatre historian W. J. MacQueen-Pope described the song as being [...] "blue" [...] and thought that it spoke volumes about her reputation thanks to her [...] "wonderful wink, and that sudden, dazzling smile, and the nod of the head." [...] Similar-styled songs followed; [...] "She'd Never had her Ticket Punched Before", told the story of a young, naive woman travelling to London on her own by train. [...] This was followed by [...] "The Wrong Man Never Let a Chance go By"; [...] "We Don't Want to Fight, But, by Jingo, If we Do"; [...] "Oh You Wink the Other Eye" [...] and [...] "Twiggy Vous"—a song which won her much success and increased her popularity abroad. After an evening's performance at the Oxford music hall, a French well-wisher requested a conversation and to meet Lloyd backstage. [...] Flanked by Courtenay, she appeared at the stage door, where Courtenay threatened the man with violence as both had become suspicious of his interest in her. She took a chance and invited the man into her dressing room, where he identified himself {{as a member of the}} French government. He confirmed to her that [...] "Twiggy Vous" [...] was [...] "most popular in Paris"; she was delighted at the news. [...] At the end of the year, Lloyd returned to London where she appeared in the Christmas pantomime Cinderella in Peckham alongside her sister Alice.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Australian {{producer}} Ian Collie {{produced a}} documentary film on P. L. Travers titled The Shadow of [...] "Mary Poppins". During the documentary's production, Collie {{noticed that there}} was [...] "an obvious biopic there" [...] and convinced Essential Media and Entertainment to develop a feature film with Sue Smith writing the screenplay. The project {{attracted the attention of}} BBC Films, which decided to finance the project, and Ruby Films' Alison Owen, who subsequently hired Kelly Marcel to co-write the screenplay with Smith. Marcel's drafts removed a subplot involving Travers and her son, and divided the story into a two-part narrative: the creative conflict between Travers and Walt Disney, and her dealings with her childhood issues, describing it as [...] "a story about the pain of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> suffered, and the grown woman who allowed herself to let go". Marcel's version, however, featured certain intellectual property rights of music and imagery which would be impossible to use without permission from The Walt Disney Company. [...] "There was always that elephant in the room, which is Disney," [...] Collie recalled. [...] "We knew Walt Disney was a key character in the film and we wanted to use quite a bit of the music. We knew we'd eventually have to show Disney." [...] In early 2010, Robert B. Sherman provided producer Alison Owen with an advance copy of a salient chapter from his then upcoming book release, [...] [...] The chapter entitled, [...] "'Tween Pavement and Stars" [...] contained characterizations and anecdotes which proved seminal to Marcel's script rewrite, in particular, the anecdote about there not being the color red in London. In July 2011, while attending the Ischia Film Festival, Owen met with Corky Hale, who offered to present the screenplay to Richard M. Sherman. Sherman read the screenplay and gave the producers his support. Later that year, Marcel and Smith's screenplay was listed in Franklin Leonard's The Black List, voted by producers {{as one of the best}} screenplays that were not in production.|$|E
2500|$|Panahi {{says that}} his style can be {{described}} as [...] "humanitarian events interpreted in a poetic and artistic way".

[...] Panahi has stated that [...] "in all of my films, you never see an evil character, male or female. I believe everyone is a good person." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the subject}} matter seems out of keeping with Bouré's monumental and public works, his friend Rodin was also {{sculpting}} children during his time in Belgium in the 1870s, when Bouré was a visitor to his studio. Several years later, Rodin produced the bronze Les enfants au lézard (Children with a Lizard), depicting <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> retreats to her older sister's arms in fear of the small lizard below. Despite a similarity of subject matter, the work bears little resemblance to Bouré's sinuous reclining figure. Rodin's approach to representing children as [...] "well-fed babies" [...] has been related to his practice in drawing cupids (erotes) for various two-dimensional media.|$|E
