5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise {{that they were being}} exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.|$|E
25|$|Aquaman {{appears as}} the main protagonist in the {{animated}} film , voiced by Matt Lanter.

500|$|Returning to live-action {{television}} in 2011, Azaria {{starred in the}} NBC sitcom Free Agents, a remake of the British series of the same name. He played Alex Taylor, a recently divorced public relations executive [...] "who is missing his kids <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> himself together", and ends up sleeping with a co-worker (Kathryn Hahn). Azaria {{also served as a}} producer on the show.

However, he liked the script and executive producer John Enbom's previous series Party Down and decided to accept the part. Despite Azaria mounting a campaign on Twitter to save it, the series was canceled after four episodes due to low ratings. In 2014, Azaria had a recurring role in the second season of Showtime's Ray Donovan, playing FBI agent Ed Cochran.|$|E

In her early appearances, she maintained {{a friendship with}} George O'Malley, until developing romantic feelings towards him. Rhimes offered the insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They’re really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater. At least, that's what Lexie is hoping. She is my kind of girl.

500|$|By 1968, Smith {{began to}} feel large amounts of {{pressure}} from the music business. The stress of touring, recording, promoting, <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a personal life led Smith to contemplate the possibility of suicide. Although she thought about suicide, Smith later clarified that she never saw the idea as an actual possibility. These pressures eventually led Smith to seek solace in both her family life and religion, becoming a Born Again Christian {{in the spring of}} 1968. Although she did not give up her music career completely, Smith did balance it with a lighter schedule in order to avoid stress. In 1968 and 1969, Smith also began to record darker songs, including the single [...] "Ribbon of Darkness", among others. Smith stated that it was reflection on her personal life, after recently divorcing her first husband Jerry Smith. Despite her recent personal troubles, Smith continued to enjoy the same commercial success she had before. In 1969 her next single [...] "You and Your Sweet Love" [...] (written by Bill Anderson) reached No.6 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart. This was followed by another top ten single in 1970, entitled [...] "I Never Once Stopped Loving You", which reached No.5 on the same singles chart. Between 1969 and 1970, Smith released two collaborative albums with American country artist Nat Stuckey called Young Love and Sunday Morning with Nat Stuckey and Connie Smith, the latter of which was a gospel album.|$|E
500|$|Matt Horner is {{the captain}} of the Raiders' {{flagship}} Hyperion and Raynor's second-in-command. Brian Bloom provides Horner's voice. Described as [...] "young and idealistic" [...] and guided by strong moral principles, Horner is originally a supporter of Mengsk, but becomes disgusted by Mengsk's deliberate attacks on civilian Confederate targets. Having come to admire Raynor's bravery and loyalty, Horner follows Raynor when he abandons Mengsk's cause, and is keen to strike at the morally bankrupt Terran Dominion. Horner is only an average combatant in personal combat, but is otherwise an excellent pilot and tactician. First introduced in the novel Queen of Blades, Horner commands the Hyperion as it comes under attack from Zerg in orbit of the planet Char and is forced to withdraw from the system, leaving Raynor and a small group of Raiders stranded on the surface; Horner is only able to return several months later to evacuate the survivors. Horner continues in a similar role in Wings of Liberty, acting as Raynor's conscience <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his commander focused. After the capture of James Raynor by Arcturus's Dominion forces in Heart of the Swarm, Matt Horner assumes temporary command of Raynor's Raiders, leading the rebel movement for much of the game until Raynor's return to the Hyperion after the raid aboard the prison ship Moros. During the events of Legacy of the Void, Horner is now an admiral commanding the Dominion fleet, joining the joint Dominion/protoss defense against Amon and his Moebius Corps forces. After Amon falls, Horner is the Dominion's chief military leader, as he and Emperor Valerian pledge to maintain peace and prosperity for the Dominion.|$|E
