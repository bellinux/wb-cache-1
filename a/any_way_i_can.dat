I will {{continue}} in the future, as I have in the past, to oppose this law in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> Any other action would be in violation of my ideal of academic freedom—that is, to teach the truth as guaranteed in our constitution, of personal and religious freedom. I think the fine is unjust.|$|E
2500|$|The President of the Massachusetts Senate {{controls}} the calling {{of a constitutional}} convention and its agenda. Senate President Tom Birmingham, an opponent of the amendment, called a joint meeting of the legislature as a constitutional convention for June 19, 2002, and immediately adjourned it for a month saying legislators needed for time to consider the agenda items. When the constitutional convention met again on July 17, the amendment's opponents knew that proponents had the 50 votes needed for passage. Birmingham, who was presiding, moved for adjournment without considering the amendment, and his motion passed 137 to 53. He called the amendment [...] "wrong-hearted and wrong-headed" [...] and defended the procedure: [...] "Everybody recognizes a vote to adjourn was a vote up or down" [...] on the amendment. [...] "I did gavel the last constitutional convention to a recess because I felt the members needed more time to assess.... Today we saw democracy in action. They may not like it, but they lost two to one." [...] A representative of the Catholic Action League, which supported the amendment, said: [...] "Everything that is wrong with Massachusetts state government was apparent today {{for all the world}} to see". One legislator who voted to adjourn said: [...] "For those of us who believe in an open democratic process, this was not a comfortable vote". State Senator Cheryl A. Jacques, an opponent of the amendment and a lesbian, said: [...] "I'm proud to have done anything possible to defeat this hate-filled, discriminatory measure. I'll take a victory on this <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get it." [...] Arlene Isaacson of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus later explained it was a critical moment because same-sex marriage had no chance of winning a popular vote at the time: [...] "Not that we would lose by a little, because that wasn't an issue. Rather, it was {{that we were going to}} get massacred".|$|E

6000|$|... "On true {{principles}} of economy, surely {{it is better}} that Emma, who knows how, should mend the clothes, than that I should botch them up in <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>can</b> earn more than she costs me!" ...|$|R
60|$|On an {{occasion}} like this the proprieties require that you merely pay compliments {{to the guest}} of the occasion, and I am merely here to pay compliments to the guest of the occasion, not to criticise him in <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say only complimentary things to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't tell," [...] I said. [...] "But I hardly {{think they}} will. They don't {{object to the}} black governor, and our queen wont {{interfere}} with them in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see. She will {{have nothing to do}} with anybody but those native Africans, who keep to themselves, anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] {{replied the}} dervish, [...] "for {{in spite of}} your manly dress your voice betrays you, I shall be proud to serve you in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> But may I ask the purpose of your question?" ...|$|E
60|$|What can {{you have}} thought of me? That I was shot or {{deserved}} to be? Forgive in the first instance, dearest friend, and believe that I won't behave so any more, if in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{got to go}} {{straight}} to Carlsbad. There's a sleeping-car that will get me there by morning: Mr. Stoller likes zeal. But I hope you'll let me be of use to you <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> before we part tomorrow." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Tuppence. [...] "That's just it. The {{terms are}} almost too liberal, Mr. Whittington. <b>I</b> cannot see <b>any</b> <b>way</b> in which <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be worth {{that amount of}} money to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So is mine; {{but that}} does not signify. You have a week yet, and I will let you know by eleven o'clock on Thursday what steps I shall finally take. If in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> serve you, I will do so; but I can admit no claim." ...|$|E

5000|$|Aparna Sen {{had seen}} Rahul Bose's work in English, August and Split Wide Open {{and felt that}} he was a good, {{controlled}} and intelligent actor. In an interview Aparna states that her choice of him for three of her films in a row is because she [...] "can deconstruct him completely and mould him differently in <b>any</b> which <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> Few actors have this kind of malleability".|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. The {{facts are}} that we're married--for better or worse, and certain things are {{expected}} of us. It's suicide for you, and folly for me, in my position, to ignore that. You have {{all you can}} reasonably want; and I don't--don't wish for any change. If you could bring anything against me--if I drank, or knocked about town, or expected too much of you. I'm not unreasonable in <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no game at all," [...] Mr. Waddington replied firmly. [...] "I {{can assure}} you, Mr. Absolom, {{and all of}} you, ladies and gentlemen, that I have simply told you what I {{believe to be the}} {{absolute}} truth. It is my business to sell whatever is sent to me here for that purpose, but it is not my business or intention to deceive you in <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You may be {{sure that}} I will come, Scopus. You have shown me much kindness, and if in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> repay you I will do so. Tell Boduoc I hope very shortly to have him with me, and that maybe I shall {{be able to find}} means of {{withdrawing}} the others from the arena." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I assure you, Mr. Outram, that I {{am deeply}} obliged {{to you for}} your caution. It has lifted a great weight from my mind, for if in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help you to obtain {{possession}} of the valuables of this People of the Mist I shall have paid off an obligation which at present crushes me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Arabella, sir, is {{a charming}} woman, and I should have deemed it a {{privilege}} to meet her--to talk to her--even--since I am in the confessional--to flirt a little with her. But if you mean to ask if my affections are in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> engaged, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> emphatically answer 'No!'--as indeed you will understand when presently I give you the reason. Apart from that, there are the unpleasant details we discussed the other day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he said, [...] "that none {{of what we}} {{call the}} careers are open to you. You could not enter Parliament, and you are too old for the professions. The services, of course, are impossible. You might write, if your tastes ran that way. Nowadays, {{it seems to be the}} fashion to record one's {{experiences}} in print, if--if they should happen to be in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> exceptional. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> think of nothing else!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother, I'm {{going to}} work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers. He is so kind to me, I must thank him, and I don't know <b>any</b> other <b>way.</b> <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> do it?" [...] asked Beth, {{a few weeks after}} that eventful call of his.|$|R
6000|$|So Peter bade Prickly Porky good-by {{and started}} for the dear old Briar-patch to try to think of some other way to help Chatterer. On the way he waked up Unc' Billy Possum and Bobby Coon, but they couldn't give him any help. [...] "There really doesn't seem to be <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help," [...] sighed Peter. And there really wasn't.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She has met him on {{the stairs}} and in the garden, but she has her meals here. I trust by the time her Easter {{holidays}} are over I may be fit to go back with her. But I do hope I {{may be able to}} copy a bit of that picture first, though, <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never forget it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Morris," [...] she said, in {{a softer}} voice, [...] "I am lazy, I know. Perhaps {{that is why}} I adore people who can work. So, {{although}} you don't think anything of me, I will do my honest best to get into sympathy with you again; yes, and to help in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> No; it's not a joke. I would give {{a great deal to}} see the thing a success." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I shall always regret {{having just}} missed knowing your father. Some {{passages}} {{in that book}} of his struck me greatly.

6000|$|... 'She did {{not write}} that letter. But never mind that. The reason why I wanted you to come here was to warn you against Sam Fisher. That was all. If there is <b>any</b> <b>way</b> in which <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help you, send for me. If you like, I will come and stay at the house till Mr Abney returns.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is evident, I am afraid," [...] he said, [...] "that Miss Lenora's {{evidence}} will help no one. As {{an expert in}} these affairs, Mr. Quest, does it not seem to you that her imprisonment {{was just a little}} purposeless? There seems to have been no attempt to harm her in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> whatever, that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess I must speak," [...] {{she thought}} wistfully. [...] "I hate to do it. I always did hate meddling. My mother {{always used to}} say that ninety-nine times out of a hundred the last state of a meddler and them she meddled with was worse than the first. But I guess it's my duty. I was Margaret's friend, and it is my duty to protect her child <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> If the Master does go back across there to meet her I must tell him what I think about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I would fain save you, for we {{have come}} to know each other; and I see that there is much good in your ways, though they differ greatly from ours. Were I to take you out, as usual, you might be killed in the streets; were you to slip away and escape, I should assuredly be put to death; but if in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help you, I would fain do so. My {{relation}} who brought you up here left, a fortnight since, to rejoin Bandoola; so his influence cannot serve you.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right. Well, now, you've got me here, {{you must}} {{let me make}} myself useful <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> I've got a spare month that I can put in here in Venice, {{just as well as}} not; I sha'n't want to push north till the frost's out of the ground. They wouldn't have a chance to try my gleaner, {{on the other side of}} the Alps much before September, anyway. Now, in Ohio, the part I come from, we cut our wheat in June. When is your wheat harvest at Middlemount?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{find myself}} in <b>any</b> <b>way</b> pinched. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> assure you my lodgings in the Quartier Latin are not {{what you would call}} sumptuous, but they are {{comfortable}} enough, and they do not stand me in a quarter of what I paid for my chambers in London. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> dine sumptuously on a franc and a half. Another franc covers my breakfast, which is generally café au lait and two eggs; another franc suffices for supper. So you see that my necessaries of life, including lodgings and fuel, do not come to anything like half my income, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> spend the rest in riotous living if I choose." ...|$|R
5000|$|After his {{conviction}} Woodham converted to Christianity, {{and said the}} following in a letter written to evangelical minister David Wilkerson: David, I receive your sermons through the mail. I {{am one of the}} school shooters. I'm the one they blame for starting it all off. On October 1, 1997, I went into Pearl High School and killed two students and wounded seven. I also killed my mother before this. After I came to jail I got saved. If there is <b>any</b> <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help your ministry, I would love to. Maybe I could give you my testimony. I’ll do anything to help. I look forward to your sermons each month… ...|$|R
