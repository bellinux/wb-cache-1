25|$|The Premier League resumed on 20 October, when Southampton {{travelled}} to face West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground. Concern {{was raised}} by fans due to manager Nigel Adkins's decisions to include goalkeeper Artur Boruc in the team and to leave Rickie Lambert out of the team, but {{in the first half}} the Saints performed strongly and looked the more likely side to score. The half ended goalless, but within three minutes after the break the travelling side were 2–0 down to the hosts, thanks to goals from midfielder Mark Noble and captain Kevin Nolan. 15 minutes later Adam Lallana scored his first goal of the season, before Lambert and Emmanuel Mayuka came on as substitutes to bolster the attacking strength of the side. Lambert had <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>quick</b> chances, but the comeback was short-lived as Noble converted from the penalty spot after a José Fonte handball. West Ham continued the dominance when they scored a fourth just before the end courtesy of a Modibo Maïga effort, and the match ended 4–1 to leave Southampton just above the relegation zone (although due to another result later in the day they dropped down to 18th).|$|E

25|$|Alec Bedser {{dominated}} the England bowling (and the Australian batsmen) {{as much as}} Len Hutton did the batting {{and by the end}} of the tour the Australians rated him the best new-ball bowler in the world. He sent down almost twice as many overs as anybody else in the Tests and took 30 wickets (16.06), including 10/105 in England's final victory at Melbourne. Bedser carried the England bowling on his broad back against in the 1940s and 1950s with a long list of short-term new-ball partners. His huge hands and powerful shoulders allowed him to bowl a lethal combination of in-swingers and leg-cutters off a short run-up and only Keith Miller - briefly - was able to cut loose from his control. In 1950-51 series he did have the support of his captain Freddie Brown, another big medium paced bowler, who surprised everybody by taking 18 wickets (21.61) despite celebrating his 40th birthday on the tour. There was also Trevor Bailey who took 14 wickets (14.14) with his naggingly accurate out-swingers that mirrored his monotonous batting as he settled on containing batsmen, but could be dangerous in the right conditions. After these three the quality of the England bowling dropped dramatically, for which the selectors must bear the brunt of the blame. Doug Wright was a mercurial leg-spinner who the MCC liked sent on tour instead of Jim Laker because he was more suited to the harder wickets abroad. He was potential match-winner, but he liked to buy his wickets and asking him to bowl was always a gamble as he could equally snap up <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>quick</b> wickets, concede a slew of runs, or both. Eric Hollies bowled one of the most famous balls in cricket when his googly dismissed Don Bradman for a duck in his last Test innings, but the Warwickshire leg-spinner was not a great turner of the ball, instead relying on line and length. Unfortunately the 1950-51 tour was the first to use extensive air travel. Hollies was scared stiff of flying and had to be drunk before he could get on a plane. He failed to turn the ball on Australian wickets and was kept out of the team by Wright. Roy Tattersall and Bob Berry were off-spinners who were supposed to tie down the Australian batsmen, but like many of their kind failed to adjust to the faster, harder Australian pitches. John Warr quickly proved himself to be the worst player in the team, he took only one test wicket - for 281 runs - when Ian Johnson walked after the umpire declined to give him out, an almost unheard of practice in Australia at the time. He improved his game during the tour, but was never more than a decent county bowler. Let loose from the hard life at Yorkshire and the Army Brian Close was undisciplined and failed on a tour for which he should not have been chosen.|$|E

50|$|Many {{of these}} women were in the World Championship race and the world record run before it. They had a year to think about and prepare their way to beat Dibaba. The final started off in a walk for these athletes, the first lap in 1:16.57. Dibaba went almost {{to the back of}} the pack, with the last chaser in her {{previous}} major races, Sifan Hassan watching her back and only Laura Muir trailing. Shannon Rowbury was relegated to the unwanted leader duties until Laura Weightman moved forward near the end of the lap. After the slow first lap, even Muir tired of jogging at the back and moved forward, but not Dibaba and Hassan. By the steeplechase pit, 550 metres into the race, Dibaba ran <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>quicker</b> steps and moved to the outside, foretelling her move. Over the next 150 metres, Dibaba floated forward with ease, Hassan following. Over the next 100 metres, Dibaba cruised to the front, with each of the key figures in the race recognizing she had passed and scrambling to follow. With a lap and a half to go, Muir was tight on Dibaba's shoulder, followed by Faith Kipyegon, Besu Sado, Jennifer Simpson, Hassan and Rowbury. Dawit Seyaum came up from behind to join the mix of leaders but all were fighting not to let Dibaba get away. At the bell, Kipyegon had gotten around Muir and was right on Dibaba's back, a gap had separated between Muir and the next chaser, Hassan. The third lap was run in 56.80. Both Dibaba and Kipyegon appeared to be in full sprint, but Kipyegon stuck to Dibaba like glue down the backstretch. Then with just over 200 to go, Kipyegon accelerated around Dibaba. Dibaba had no answer. Kipyegon continued to extend her lead on to the finish line. Behind them was the battle for bronze. With 150 to go, Hassan caught Muir but Simpson was right on her back and Rowbury was gaining from behind. Coming off the turn, Simpson went into her sprint, which left Hassan behind. Rowbury also ran past Hassan and followed Simpson to the line. Dibaba tied up badly going in to the finish, with Simpson rapidly gaining, but the finish line arrived for Dibaba faster than a sprinting Simpson could get there.|$|R

In this paper, we present new tools for the segmentation of two- and three-dimensional objects from multidimensional image data.

A contour grouping algorithm based on path optimization can be used when full user interaction is required. Interactivity is limited to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> simple and <b>quick</b> operations. Another, region-based method uses a split-and-merge strategy and discrete optimization with global shape criteria. Grouping of primitive region patches is invoked by a contour model and a comparison of shape features.
