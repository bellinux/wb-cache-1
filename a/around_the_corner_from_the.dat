By this time the building had become a community center.|$|E
25|$|At that time, the Wicking Library was the school's newest wing. The {{library in}} the parking lot did not satisfy {{educators}} who thought that a library could be the center of instructional activity. In addition, many classrooms in the school needed upgrading and the music facilities were poor. The plan to solve these problems showed a small addition on the left, a new hallway across the rear of the plant, and rooms surrounding the library. The music department would get two big practice rooms and a classroom. A large two-story structure was planned to surround the library. When the plans were revealed, everyone was happy that the definitely modern building would be <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traditional Georgian Facade. In September 1973, the new wing was completed. South now had first-class science labs and social studies classrooms, appropriately naming the new addition the “S-Building.” In addition to the new classrooms, South gained a new 116-seat lecture hall.|$|E

Sanders and another student were down at the end of the hallway still trying to secure as much of the school as they could. As they ran, they encountered Harris and Klebold, who were approaching from the corner of the North Hallway. Sanders and the student turned and ran in the opposite direction. Harris and Klebold shot at them both, with Harris hitting Sanders twice in the chest but missing the student. The latter ran into a science classroom and warned everyone to hide. Klebold walked over towards Sanders, who had collapsed, to look for the student but returned to Harris up the North Hallway.|$|E

The image on the left facing right is a bare-chested worker holding a globe, towering above the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, with sleek aircraft flying above and below him, and ships moving in the bay. The actual bridge {{can be seen from}} the house; it had been completed the previous year when the Malloch Building was under construction. <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main entrance, the third silvery mural shows a robed woman, the spirit of California, standing in front of California represented as a map.|$|E
500|$|Following {{several months}} of rumours {{regarding}} the restaurant, the Berkeley Hotel confirmed in May 2008 {{that it was going}} to work with Wareing to launch his only solo restaurant, and he would take on Pétrus' lease from 19 September 2008 onwards. Wareing had previously complained of interference in the kitchen by GRH, and wanted to come out from under Ramsay's shadow, but later admitted that he had engineered the situation so that he could go out on his own. The split with Ramsay and GRH resulted in a public legal battle and feud between the three parties, which when resolved resulted in Wareing stating in an interview for Waitrose Food Illustrated magazine that Ramsay left him bitter and conflicted; [...] "half of me thinks he’s a sad bastard and the other half still adores him." [...] He went on to describe Ramsay as a celebrity chef who wasn't involved in the industry anymore. The legal dispute was resolved with Ramsay gaining the rights to the Pétrus name, and Wareing signing a gag order regarding the situation but continuing to open his restaurant Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley. Wareing remarked of the situation, [...] "If I never speak to that guy again for the rest of my life, it wouldn't bother me one bit." [...] Ramsay later responded regarding the feud that he wishes Wareing [...] "all the best". Wareing's self-named restaurant won the Best Restaurant in London Award by Harden's guide in 2008 and 2009, was awarded two Michelin stars in 2009, and was named Time Out's restaurant of the year in 2010. The new Pétrus was opened <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Berkeley Hotel at 1 Kinnerton Street, Knightsbridge. Ramsay later joked, that with Heston Blumenthal also opening his new restaurant nearby, the three of them could [...] "all have a fight in the street at four in the morning".|$|E

St Paul's Juniors is now on the same site as the main school and most of its pupils are expected to pass into St Paul's School when they reach the age of 13.

Mick Carney, who ran the gym where David began training from 10 years old, said of Haye: [...] "He could whack as a kid. I think he chinned about three kids. But that made it really hard to get him matches. When you've got three first-round knockouts on your card everybody runs for the hills." [...] Of his upbringing, he described Haye as [...] "a lovely kid. He comes from a beautiful, loving family. He wasn't on the streets. He went to school, came to the gym, went home.
