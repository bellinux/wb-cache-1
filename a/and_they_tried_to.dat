5|$|McKinley {{was born}} in 1843 in Niles, Ohio. After service as an Army officer in the Civil War, he became a lawyer and settled in Canton, Ohio. In 1876 {{he was elected to}} Congress, and he {{remained}} there most of the time until 1890, when he was defeated for re-election in a gerrymandered district. By this time he was considered a likely presidential candidate, especially after being elected governor in 1891 and 1893. McKinley had incautiously co-signed the loans of a friend, and demands for repayment were made on him when his friend went bankrupt in the Panic of 1893. Personal insolvency would have removed McKinley as a factor in the 1896 campaign, but he was rescued from this by businessmen who supported him, led by his friend and political manager, Mark Hanna. With that obstacle removed, Hanna built McKinley's campaign organization through 1895 and 1896. McKinley refused to deal with the eastern bosses such as Thomas Platt and Matthew Quay, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> block his nomination by encouraging state favorite son candidates to run and prevent McKinley from getting a majority of delegate votes at the Republican National Convention, which might force him to make deals on political patronage. Their efforts were in vain, as the large, efficient McKinley organization swept him to a first ballot victory at the convention, with New Jersey's Garret Hobart as his running mate.|$|E
25|$|Although the 1990s {{have been}} {{regarded}} as a poor decade, this era was worse. The great 1939 championship-winning team was quickly split up in 1946. Tommy Lawton was sold to Chelsea, Joe Mercer disagreed with the manager Theo Kelly and was sold to Arsenal, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> sell T. G. Jones to Roma. Soon, only Ted Sagar was left.|$|E
25|$|The stereotypical {{views about}} blacks {{imparted}} to s Mike Mizanin by his uncle offended Coral Smith and Nicole Mitsch when he related them, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> educate him on African American culture. They were also {{offended by the}} fact that biracial roommate Malik Cooper wore a T-shirt with the image of Marcus Garvey, who was against miscegenation, despite the fact that Cooper was of mixed heritage and by his own admission had never dated a black woman.|$|E

25|$|The Basford route was {{the scene}} of a fatal {{accident}} on 3 August 1880. Two young girls were crossing Alfreton Road. A bleach van approached <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> avoid it, one of them ran in front of a passing tram car and was knocked down by the horses. A wheel passed over her neck and she was killed on the spot. At an inquest the coroner exonerated the company and recorded a verdict of accidental death.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{settlement}} of Alta California {{was the last}} colonization project to expand Spain's vastly over-extended empire in North America, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do it with minimal cost and support. Approximately {{half the cost of}} settling Alta California was borne by donations and half by funds from the Spanish crown. Massive Indian revolts in New Mexico's Pueblo Revolt among the Pueblo Indians of the Rio Grande valley in the 1680s as well as Pima Indian Revolt in 1751 and the ongoing Seri conflicts in Sonora Mexico provided the Franciscan friars with arguments to establish missions with fewer colonial settlers. In particular, the sexual exploitation of Native American women by Spanish soldiers sparked violent reprisals from the Native community and the spread of venereal disease.|$|E
25|$|Fatmawati objected {{when her}} husband took Hartini, his new wife, {{according}} to Muslim law. Sukarno married another woman from Java in 1953 and Fatmawati {{moved out of the}} presidential palace and lived separately in Jakarta. As part of the settlement Fatmawati was allowed to keep the title of First Lady. This development was a major blow to the growing women's movement. Fatmawati decided {{that she was going to}} divorce the President, but she could not find a religious leader who was willing to oppose the will of Sukarno. The women's organisation consoled and advised Fatmawati <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> encourage her to return to the palace and reestablish her rights. Sukarno himself was annoyed by this development although his new wife understood Fatmawati's anger.|$|E

25|$|In WCW, Rude {{became a}} member of the New World Order (nWo), {{managing}} his friend Curt Hennig. Thus, Rude became the first wrestler to be part of both DX and nWo. When the nWo split, Hennig and Rude joined the nWo Wolfpac, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> motivate Konnan to defeat Goldberg, who was undefeated at the time. When Konnan was defeated by Goldberg, Rude and Hennig attacked him, later joining nWo Hollywood, the rivals of the Wolfpac. By late 1998, both Rude and Hennig were off WCW television due to injuries. Hennig had an ongoing leg injury that year, and Rude was thought to have had testicular cancer which later turned out to be a spermatocele. Hennig returned to the nWo from his injury at Starrcade without Rude, who was still unable to appear. Rude officially left WCW in March 1999.|$|E
25|$|Around 1200, stone-faced, clay-filled jetties were {{starting}} to project into the river, an indication that trade was increasing in Newcastle. As the Roman roads continued to deteriorate, sea travel was gaining in importance. By 1275 Newcastle was the sixth largest wool exporting port in England. The principal exports at this time were wool, timber, coal, millstones, dairy produce, fish, salt and hides. Much of the developing trade was with the Baltic countries and Germany. Most of the Newcastle merchants were situated near the river, below the Castle. The earliest known charter was dated 1175 in the reign of Henry II, giving the townspeople some control over their town. In 1216 King John granted Newcastle a mayor and also allowed the formation of guilds (known as Mysteries). These were cartels formed within different trades, which restricted trade to guild members. There were initially twelve guilds. Coal was being exported from Newcastle by 1250, and by 1350 the burgesses received a royal licence to export coal. This licence to export coal was jealously guarded by the Newcastle burgesses, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> prevent any one else on the Tyne from exporting coal except through Newcastle. The burgesses similarly tried to prevent fish from being sold anywhere else on the Tyne except Newcastle. This led to conflicts with Gateshead and South Shields.|$|E

500|$|In November 2002, Capcom {{announced}} the Capcom Five, {{a group of}} video games developed by Capcom Production Studio 4 and overseen by Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami. Among these titles was P.N.03, directed by Mikami. Capcom conceived the Capcom Five to bring new intellectual property to the industry, which the company viewed {{at the time as}} stagnant. According to producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi, the P.N.03 team's goal was to make a game both [...] "fun to watch and fun to play". The team focused on the game's audiovisuals, action, and speed, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> balance the [...] "tension experienced on the battlefield and the exhilaration of taking out the enemies". Mikami wanted P.N.03 to evoke the same feelings as classic Nintendo games. While the staff felt the background graphics were important, they prioritized excitement in the game world.|$|E
500|$|McCall {{was picked}} for England and Scotland under-21 sides {{on the same}} day in 1984, and chose to join the England under-21 squad for their game against Turkey. However he was only picked as a {{substitute}} and the referee blew the final whistle, with McCall waiting to come on. He later told Scottish newspaper Glasgow Herald, [...] "I felt it was a mistake almost from the start. I was put on the bench <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> bring me on with a minute to go. But I took my time re-tying my boots and generally warming up and luckily didn't get on, otherwise that would have been that." [...] Since he had not actually played for England, McCall was still eligible for Scotland. He eventually switched allegiances to the latter, for whom he qualified through his father. He made his Scotland debut at under-21 level in March 1988, ironically against England. McCall made one more appearance for Scotland under 21s, against France in 1990.|$|E
500|$|Orci noted {{while the}} time travel story {{allowed them to}} alter some backstory {{elements}} such as Kirk's first encounter with the Romulans, they could not {{use it as a}} crutch to change everything <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> approach the film as a prequel as much as possible. Kirk's service on Farragut, a major backstory point to the original episode [...] "", was left out because it was deemed irrelevant to the story of Kirk meeting Spock, although Orci felt nothing in his script precluded it from the new film's backstory. There was a scene involving Kirk meeting Carol Marcus (who is revealed as the mother of his son in [...] ) as a child, but it was dropped because the film needed more time to introduce the core characters. Figuring out ways to get the crew together required some contrivances, which Orci and Kurtzman wanted to explain from old Spock as a way of the timeline mending itself, highlighting the theme of destiny. The line was difficult to write and was ultimately cut out.|$|E

500|$|... "The Crepes of Wrath" [...] was {{the first}} episode of The Simpsons for which George Meyer was {{credited}} as a writer, and he wrote it together with Sam Simon, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. The episode {{was inspired by the}} French movie Manon of the Spring. The writers were trying to figure out which country the foreign exchange student should come from when they came up with Albania. They had not seen many uses of the country on television and decided to make the episode a tribute to actor John Belushi, who has Albanian roots. The writers did not know much about the country and could not think of a good name for the boy so they gave him the surname Hoxha after the former leader of Albania, Enver Hoxha. They used real Albanian in the scene where Adil says goodbye to his family, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> get the actual language right at Sam Simon's instigation. They also used real French in the scenes of Bart in France. The writers did some research on a certain airport in France for the shots of Bart at the airport in Paris. Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes Skinner, made her first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode, although her voice was a bit different from what the viewers are used to in the later episodes of the show.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} tied at 7-7 {{in the second}} quarter. At the time, the Redskins had been {{attempting}} to run a [...] "flea-flicker" [...] play; Theismann had handed off to fullback John Riggins, who subsequently lateralled the ball back to the quarterback. The Giants' defense, however, was not fooled, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> blitz Theismann. As Taylor pulled Theismann down, Taylor's knee came down and drove straight into Theismann's lower right leg, fracturing both the tibia and the fibula. Giants linebackers Gary Reasons and Harry Carson then joined Taylor in the sack.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1991 book, [...] "Punk and American Values", Timothy Miller {{described}} the hippie ethos as essentially a [...] "religious movement" [...] whose {{goal was to}} transcend the limitations of mainstream religious institutions. [...] "Like many dissenting religions, the hippies were enormously hostile to the religious institutions of the dominant culture, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> find new and adequate ways to do the tasks the dominant religions failed to perform." [...] In his seminal, contemporaneous work, [...] "The Hippie Trip", author Lewis Yablonsky notes that those who were most respected in hippie settings were the spiritual leaders, the so-called [...] "high priests" [...] who emerged during that era.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Shariati’ thought, {{the rule}} of the unity of Allah forms the basic element of an equal and just society in the Muhammad prophet’s tradition.

Akbar Goodarzi who were affected by revolutionary thought of Shariati, authored interpretation of the Quran named monotheistic ideology. Shariati [...] followed Islamic method without clerical intervention such as Abul A'la Maududi ’s idea but Goodarzi was more fanatical than Shariati [...] and on 1970 the Forqan group was founded by him. Another person who had important effect on forming the ideology of Forqan group was Habibollah Ashory, the frustrated cleric.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{sold out}} Paris concert, {{multiple}} fans {{who were not}} able to get in to see the performance because of its 2,000 person limit began to throw stones at the venue, and were consequently tear gassed by police. It was also popular to see moshing and stage diving at their shows, but the band members discouraged this type of behavior. [...] "They hated it <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> stop it as much as possible," [...] artist Arturo Vega recalled, [...] "but it would happen. Kids are really resourceful. Once the lawsuits started coming in, a lot of clubs tried to ban it, too. Sometimes the security made it difficult for them, you know. Once, we were in Tijuana--and of coursem in Tiuana, who cares!

2500|$|Tolkien {{described}} how, in {{the history}} of Dol Guldur, Sauron's growing activity and power increased the tensions among his enemies.

In response to the growing threat at Dol Guldur, they formed the White Council in , shortly after Sauron's return to the fortress. Much later, in , Gandalf infiltrated the area to probe Dol Guldur, and discovered that the evil presence whose identity he had long suspected was indeed Sauron.
