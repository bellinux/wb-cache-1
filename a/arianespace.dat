Its Ku-band capacity is expected to provide high-density data transmission facility both for voice and video. This satellite has been provided with additional power to communicate with smaller and mobile (not necessarily land-based) terminals. This dedicated satellite is expected to provide the Indian navy with an approximately 3,500 - 4,000 km footprint over the Indian Ocean region, and over both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal region and enable real-time networking of all its operational assets in the water (and land). It also will help the navy to operate in a network-centric atmosphere.|$|R
25|$|On 7 May 2014, {{the first}} two FOC {{satellites}} landed in Guyana for their joint launch planned in summer Originally planned for launch during 2013, problems tooling and establishing the production line for assembly led to a delay of a year in serial production of Galileo satellites. These two satellites (Galileo satellites GSAT-201 and GSAT-202) were launched on 22 August 2014. The names of these satellites are Doresa and Milena named after European children who had previously won a drawing contest. On 23 August 2014, launch service provider <b>Arianespace</b> announced that the flight VS09 experienced anomaly and satellites were injected into an incorrect orbit.|$|E
25|$|ESA has a {{fleet of}} {{different}} launch vehicles in service with which it competes in all sectors of the launch market. ESA's fleet consists of three major rocket designs: Ariane 5, Soyuz-2 and Vega. Rocket launches are carried out by <b>Arianespace,</b> which has 23 shareholders representing the industry that manufactures the Ariane 5 as well as CNES, at ESA's Guiana Space Centre. Because many communication satellites have equatorial orbits, launches from French Guiana are able to take larger payloads into space than from spaceports at higher latitudes. In addition, equatorial launches give spacecraft an extra 'push' of nearly 500m/s due to the higher rotational velocity of the Earth at the equator compared to near the Earth's poles where rotational velocity approaches zero.|$|E
25|$|The Russian {{government}} {{accepted an}} offer of Rosaviakosmos on 10 March 2001 to co-operate with the Asia-Pacific Space Centre in developing a spaceport on Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean. The project also saw the involvement of S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, TsSKB-Progress and the Barmin General Mechanical Engineering Design Bureau. In aid of the project, the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Russian Federation on Cooperation in the Field of the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes was signed in Canberra on 23 May 2001, replacing the Agreement between the Government of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics and the Government of Australia on Cooperation in the Field of Exploration and the Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes of 1 December 1987, and import tax and other concessions {{were made by the}} Australian government. Co-operation in space was on the agenda when Alexander Downer met in Moscow with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov in February 2002, where the Australian side pressed the Russians to complete work on two technical agreements which were needed in order for the Christmas Island spaceport project to proceed. In June 2002 it was reported that the Russian Federal Space Agency had pulled out of the deal, to instead develop a relationship with <b>ArianeSpace</b> with the view to using the Guiana Space Centre near Kourou in French Guiana.|$|E
50|$|Super RTL {{launched}} in Germany in 1995, as {{a joint venture}} between Disney and the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Télédiffusion (or CLT). Disney finally {{launched in}} the UK on the Sky platform on 1 October 1995, as the first Disney Channel in Europe and outside the United States; its first program was the British television premiere of the animated feature The Jungle Book. But before that happened however, SES (known as Société Européenne des Satellites at that time), which operated the satellite it broadcast on, first bought Satcom K3 from GE Americom during its construction, as GE Americom was no longer satisfied with the satellite, thus selling it to SES. GE's AstroSpace division (now Lockheed Martin Space Systems) then modified the satellite for DBS usage for SES. It was launched on board the European Space Agency and <b>Arianespace's</b> Ariane 4 rocket on Flight V42, on March 2, 1991, to add extra capacity to the satellite television services from 19.2° east, serving Germany, the UK and Republic of Ireland, as Astra 1B.|$|R
