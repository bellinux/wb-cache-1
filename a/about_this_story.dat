He might {{have done the same thing}} if their roles were reversed. The one constant in every telling of the tale until “The Revenant” opened was Hugh Glass wanted his gun back." [...] The reporting <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> indicates that Glass did track down Fitzgerald and demand the rifle's return, which Fitzgerald sullenly complied with.|$|E
500|$|During December 2008, {{while still}} in the process of drafting, Loeb said that he had been riveted by the Bernard Madoff {{headlines}} and showed interest in referencing him in the film, noting: [...] "the thing that is so crazy <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> is that Ponzi schemes seem to be the simplest low-class scam," [...] and [...] "but this was carried out in the highest echelon of high finance. You couldn't even get in to see this guy unless you had $2 million to invest." [...] Stone clarified that Madoff will not be mentioned in the film, commenting that he considered Madoff's actions to be [...] "a crook running a Ponzi scheme" [...] which is [...] "legal robbery." [...] The filmmaker returned to the project in April on the strength of this script, feeling Loeb's draft was [...] "so great" [...] that he did not feel the need to touch it, although he did have the option.|$|E
2500|$|A common myth <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> is {{that the}} colour-separation overlay (CSO) {{backgrounds}} were accidentally omitted {{in some of the}} car interior scenes, leaving the blue screen behind the characters. In reality, the blue is supposed to represent the sky. The differing shades of blue compared to the location exterior footage {{is the result of the}} shots' separate origins. This is contradicted by Paul Vanezis in an interview, in which he states [...] "I wouldn't put a background in and I'll tell you why they didn't put a background in there - it wasn't lit properly. There wasn't enough blue in it to key it, or yellow or green or whatever it was. It was shot wrong. It shouldn't have been shot in the studio and it shouldn't have been shot on xchrome. These days with modern technology you could easily key it... easily, but it wouldn't look right." ...|$|E

2500|$|A new Christmas special episode {{aired on}} 25 December 2007 on BBC One, in which pop star George Michael made a guest appearance. He was {{featured}} in several scenes with Irish nurse, Bernie, including one kissing scene. The character of Lauren {{was killed in a}} kayaking accident during the episode. Rumours had emerged <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> line in July 2007. Kathy Burke and Tamzin Outhwaite also guest starred, and the special averaged with 6.4 million viewers. The episode was subject to criticism when some viewers complained about the amount of swearing, and accused Tate of bigotry over the depiction of a family from Northern Ireland as terrorists, whose Christmas presents included a balaclava and a pair of knuckle dusters, in reference to The Troubles. A statement was issued from the BBC that read [...] "Catherine Tate creates characters who are so over the top as to be almost cartoon-like and this is where her genius lies. Her comedy is never meant to offend any viewer and is always based on satire and grotesque exaggeration." [...] After the complaints were made, an Ofcom report later concluded that the show was not offensive and did not violate broadcasting regulations. An extract from the Ofcom report read [...] "Overall this episode was typical of the Catherine Tate Show and would not have gone beyond the expectations of its usual audience. For those not familiar with the show, the information given at the start was adequate." ...|$|E

6000|$|A {{singular}} thing <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> {{has been}} the revival of interest in it that has occurred from time to time.

Now, I have no means of totally disproving such charges as this which the Judge makes. A man cannot prove a negative; but he has a right to claim that when a man makes an affirmative charge, he must offer some proof to show the truth of what he says. I certainly cannot introduce testimony to show the negative about things, but I have a right to claim that if a man says he knows a thing, then he must show how he knows it. I always have a right to claim this, and it is not satisfactory to me that he may be [...] "conscientious" [...] on the subject.|$|E
