5|$|Brocius waived the {{preliminary}} hearing so he and his case could be immediately transferred to Tucson. Wyatt and a deputy took Brocius in <b>a</b> <b>wagon</b> {{the next day to}} Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from being lynched. Wyatt testified that he thought the shooting was accidental. It was also demonstrated that Brocius' pistol could be fired from half-cock. Fred White left a statement before he died two days later that the shooting was not intentional. Based on the evidence presented, Brocius was not charged with White's death.|$|E

When expressing a desire to get {{involved}} in fighting, Clay Duncan insists that, because it's too dangerous for a woman, she must remain at the ranch. She agrees, but her acquiescence was a pretence, as she later joins the fray, offering opportune assistance. Similar scenes recur in her two subsequent appearances in issues #5 and 6.|$|E

At certain experience point thresholds, players earn shipments that may be turned in for cards from the player's Home City, which can include units, upgrades, or resources. The game progresses similar to most real-time strategy games until one side resigns.|$|E
