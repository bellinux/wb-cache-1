40|$|SUMMARY A new {{pipeline}} controller {{based on}} the Early Acknowl-edgement (EA) protocol is proposed for bundled-data asynchronous cir-cuits. The EA protocol indicates acknowledgement by the falling edge of the <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>signal</b> {{in contrast to the}} 4 -phase protocol, which in-dicates it on the rising edge. Thus, it can hide the overhead caused by the resetting period of the handshake cycle. Since we have designed our controller assuming several timing constraints, we first analyze the tim-ing constraints under which our controller correctly works and then dis-cuss their appropriateness. The performance of the controller is compared both analytically and experimentally with those of two other pipeline con-trollers, namely, a very high-speed 2 -phase controller and an ordinary 4 -phase controller. Our controller performs better than 4 -phase controller when pipeline has processing elements. We have obtained interesting results {{in the case of a}} non-linear pipeline with a Conditional Branch (CB) operation. Our controller has slightly better performance even compared to 2 -phase controller in the case of a pipeline with processing elements. Its superiority lies in the EA proto-col, which employs return-to-zero control signals like the 4 -phase protocol. Hence, our controller for CB operation is simple in construction just like the 4 -phase controller. A 2 -phase controller for the same operation needs to have a slightly complicated mechanism to handle the 2 -phase operation because of the non-return-to-zero control signals, and this results in a per-formance overhead...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{feedback}} control systems give {{little attention to}} issues associated with {{the flow of information}} through the feedback loop. Typically implemented with dedicated communication links that deliver nearly precise, reliable and non-delayed information, researchers have not needed to concern themselves with issues related to quantized, delayed and even lost information. With the advent of newer technologies and application areas that pass information through non-reliable networks, these issues can not be ignored. In recent years the field of Networked Control Systems (NCS) has emerged to describe situations where these issues are present. The research in this field focuses on quantifying performance degradations in the presence of network effects and proposing algorithms for managing the information flow to counter those negative effects. In this thesis I propose and analyze algorithms for managing information flow for several NCS scenarios; state estimation with lossy measurement signals, using input buffers to reduce the frequency of communication with a remote plant, and performing state estimation when control signals are transmitted to a remote plant via a lossy communication link with no <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>signal</b> at the estimator. Multi-agent coordinated control systems serve as a prime example of an emerging area of {{feedback control}} systems that utilize feedback loops with information passed through possibly imperfect communication networks. In these systems, agents use a communication network to exchange information in order to achieve a desired global objective. Hence managing the information flow has a direct impact on the performance of the system. I also explore this area by focusing on the problem of multi-agent average consensus. I propose an algorithm based on a hierarchical decomposition of the communication topology to speed up the time to convergence. For all these topics I focus on designing intuitive algorithms that intelligently manage the information flow and provide analysis and simulations to illustrate their effectiveness...|$|E

Recently, for providing highspeed downlink packet access (HSDPA) in the wideband codedivision multiple access system, an indicator-based stall avoidance (ISA) mechanism was proposed to remove the nonrecoverable gap in the received out-of-sequence packets. In this paper, we derive the closed-form expression for the gap-processing time of the ISA mechanism when applying the multiprocess stop-and-wait (SAW) hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) mechanism. The derived analytical formulas can be used to understand performance tradeoffs between the gap-processing time and throughput in terms of various numbers of users and parallel processes when implementing the multiprocess SAW HARQ mechanism in the HSDPA system...|$|R

50|$|Stop-and-wait ARQ, also {{referred}} to as alternating bit protocol, is a method in telecommunications to send information between two connected devices. It ensures that information is not lost due to dropped packets and that packets are received in the correct order. It is the simplest automatic repeat-request (ARQ) mechanism. A stop-and-wait ARQ sender sends one frame at a time; it is a special case of the general sliding window protocol with transmit and receive window sizes equal to one and greater than one respectively. After sending each frame, the sender doesn't send any further frames until it receives an <b>acknowledgement</b> (ACK) <b>signal.</b> After receiving a valid frame, the receiver sends an ACK. If the ACK does not reach the sender before a certain time, known as the timeout, the sender sends the same frame again.The timeout countdown is reset after each frame transmission.
