40|$|Silica spheres {{that are}} {{prepared}} by the Stöber process are usually considered non-porous. Here we report on a slightly modified synthesis protocol that allows preparation of microporous Stöber particles. Successive treatment with water and alcohol at room temperature results in substantial reorganization of the silica within the Stöber particles. Hydrolysis of <b>alkoxy</b> <b>groups</b> as well as condensation and re-esterification of silanol groups upon re-immersion in alcohol are crucial for that process. As {{the result of the}} silica reorganization, micropore channels are formed within the particles. After a final washing with water to remove all <b>alkoxy</b> <b>groups</b> from the particles, pure microporous silica spheres are obtained.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the concentration of acid sites for isobutane/n-butene alkylation on zeolite BEA {{with varying degrees of}} Na+ ion exchange is reported. All catalysts studied showed complete n-butene conversion over a significant time-on-stream. Isooctanes were the dominating products over H-BEA, while the importance of di- and multiple alkylation increased with increasing Na+ concentration in the zeolite. In parallel, the integral number of turnovers per catalytic site markedly decreased. The acid site deactivation is affiliated with blocking by hexadecane species. The higher rate of catalyst deactivation with increasing degree of Na+ exchange is thus attributed to the increase in the probability of having a further butene molecule added to a C 8 <b>alkoxy</b> <b>group</b> in place of undergoing hydride transfer from isobutane to desorb as isooctane. This {{is a direct result of}} the decreasing concentration of <b>alkoxy</b> <b>groups</b> that can react with n-butene while maintaining the same rate of olefin transport through the pores. Addition of a strong hydride donor/acceptor molecule (adamantane) indicates that the product composition of the isooctane isomers is determined by their lifetime as <b>alkoxy</b> <b>groups.</b> The longer the lifetime before experiencing hydride transfer, the closer the product composition approaches the chemical equilibrium...|$|R

The morphology, thermal and mechanical properties were studied {{as a function of}} silica content and compared with the similar composites having no interphase interaction. The polyimide precursors, polyamic acids (PAAs) with or without pendant hydroxyl groups were prepared from the reaction of pyromellitic dianhydride with a mixture of oxydianiline and 1, 3 phenylenediamine or 2, 4 -diminophenol in dimethylacetamide. The PAA with pendant hydroxyl groups was reacted with isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane to produce <b>alkoxy</b> <b>groups</b> on the chain. The reinforcement of PAA matrices with or without <b>alkoxy</b> <b>groups</b> on the chain was carried out by mixing appropriate amount of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and carrying out its hydrolysis and condensation in a sol-gel process.

40|$|International audienceBased on the {{electrochemical}} properties {{of a series}} of metallophthalocyanines this article shows that the phthalocyanine bearing four <b>alkoxy</b> <b>groups</b> and twelve fluorine atoms behaves approximately as those with eight fluorine atoms. This indicates that the electron-donating effect of one <b>alkoxy</b> <b>group</b> balances the electro-withdrawing effect of one fluorine atom. We engaged three metallophthalocyanines, namely the octafluoro copper phthalocyanine, Cu(F 8 Pc), an octaester metallophthalocyanine and a phthalocyanine bearing four <b>alkoxy</b> <b>groups</b> and twelve fluorine atoms, Zn(T 4 F 12 Pc), in building original conductometric transducers that are Molecular Semiconductor – Doped Insulator heterojunctions (MSDIs) in association with the highly conductive lutetium bisphthalocyanine, LuPc 2. Whereas the octaester derivative and Zn(T 4 F 12 Pc) exhibited a negative response to ammonia, as expected for p-type materials, Cu(F 8 Pc) exhibited a particular behavior. At low humidity levels, 30 and 10 % rh, the current of the Cu(F 8 Pc) /LuPc 2 MSDI decreases, similarly to p-type devices, but at higher relative humidity values, 70 % rh, the current increases under ammonia, which is the signature of a n-type behavior. This ambipolar behavior is unique amongst semiconducting sensing materials. This work opens the way to the study of ambipolar materials as sensing materials {{for the development of a}} new type of conductometric gas sensors...|$|R
50|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism for an oxidation of an alcohol to an aldehyde {{according to the}} so-called hypervalent twisting mechanism involves a ligand exchange reaction replacing the hydroxyl group by the alcohol followed by a twist and an elimination reaction. The twist is a requirement because the iodine to oxygen double bond is oriented out of plane with the <b>alkoxy</b> <b>group</b> and the concerted elimination {{would not be able}} to take place. This twist reaction is a rearrangement in which the oxygen atom is moved into a proper plane for a 5 membered cyclic transition state in the elimination reaction and is calculated by Computational chemistry to be the rate-determining step in the oxidation. The twist mechanism also explains why oxidation is faster for larger alcohols than for small alcohols. The twist is driven forward by the steric hindrance that exists between the ortho hydrogen atom and the protons from the <b>alkoxy</b> <b>group</b> and larger <b>alkoxy</b> <b>groups</b> create larger steric repulsion. The same computation predicts a much faster reacting IBX derivative with a 100 fold reaction rate when this ortho hydrogen atom is replaced by a methyl group thus facilitating the twist until the elimination reaction takes prevalence as the rate determining step.|$|R

A {{series of}} 7 -alkoxy norbornadiene monomers (2 b-d), containing <b>alkoxy</b> <b>groups</b> with decreasing steric hindrance in the 7 -position have been prepared.

A small amount of another carbene species X, giving a broad signal at 17. 44 ppm, is also formed which is extremely stable in solution. The species X is an active metathesis species and is able to perform ROMP on strained cyclic olefins.
