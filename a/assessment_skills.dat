In addition, EMT-Bs are trained to assist patients with administration of certain prescribed medications, including nitroglycerin, Metered-dose inhaler such as albuterol, and epinephrine auto injectors such as the EpiPen. EMT-Bs can typically also administer certain non-preprescribed drugs including oxygen, oral glucose, and activated charcoal (usually upon medical direction). In response to the opioid overdose epidemic, states are rapidly changing protocols to permit EMT-Bs to administer naloxone as well.|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{perspectives}} of Community Nurse Practitioner’s use of medical physical <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> in primary care; a qualitative study of current {{practice in the}} UK. Aim To explore the use of medical physical <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> (PAS) by community nurse practitioners in primary care in the UK Background: Physical <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> are commonly practiced by community nurse practitioners in primary care. These skills are used to support GPs to deliver {{a wide range of}} services in primary care. There is no evidence on how physical <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> are used by community nurse practitioners in primary care Methods: A qualitative interpretative embedded case study design. Results: Participants reported that community nurse practitioners used medical PAS in integrated ways, by bringing together their clinical expertise, leadership, education and liaison skills to work across professional boundaries, to deliver a range of services. Specialist nurses caring for patient with one or more chronic long-term condition use these skills within the constructs of a person-centred framework, which is relationship focussed, holistic and collaborative. Nurse practitioners use physical <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> to work as generalists and make independent diagnostic decisions. Competence, capability and performance are necessary to make complex decisions. Failure of community nurse practitioners to take responsibility for assessment decisions creates inter-professional tensions and conflict. Conclusions: Medical physical <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> are successfully being used by community nurse practitioners to deliver a wide range of services in primary care. These skills improve competence, capability and performance for advanced nursing practice roles. Physical <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> education and training at universities needs to be validated by allied health professional bodies for advanced practice roles. Relevance to clinical practice: •	Physical assessment education and training prepares nurses with higher levels of theoretical assessment knowledge and skills that are fit for purpose. •	GPs believe that education and training of physical <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> are vital for nurses to manage the burden of assessment work in primary care. •	Common sets of assessment practices between disciplines have better outcomes for patients •	Registered nurses require a standard of competence which allows them to perform physical <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> to the same level as doctors. •	Competence and performance are best achieved when working with patients and experienced clinicians.

40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} The {{aim of this}} study was to explore the consequences of the nurse's use of advanced <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> on medical and surgical wards. Background Appropriate, accurate, and timely assessment by nurses is the cornerstone of maintaining patient safety in hospitals. The inclusion of "advanced" physical <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> such as auscultation, palpation, and percussion is thought to better prepare nurses for complex patient presentations within a wide range of clinical situations. Design This qualitative study used a hermeneutic pragmatic approach. Method Unstructured interviews were conducted with five experienced medical and surgical nurses to obtain 13 detailed narratives of assessment practice. Narratives were analyzed using Van Manen's six-step approach to identify the consequences of the nurse's use of advanced <b>assessment</b> <b>skills.</b> Results The consequences of using advanced <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> include looking for more, challenging interpretations, and perseverance. The use of advanced <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> directs what the nurse looks for, what she sees, interpretation of the findings, and her response. It is the interpretation of what is seen, heard, or felt within the full context of the patient situation, which is the advanced skill. Conclusion Advanced assessment skill is the means to an accurate interpretation of the clinical situation and contributes to appropriate diagnosis and medical management in complex patient situations. Relevance to clinical practice The nurse's use of advanced <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> enables her to contribute to diagnostic reasoning within the acute medical and surgical setting...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{establish}} what advanced physical <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> {{are being}} used by cardiac nurses after they undertook a clinical patient assessment module; and to explore {{the factors that influence}} their use of these skills. METHOD: A longitudinal descriptive approach using convenience sampling was employed. Qualitative data was obtained from individual interviews, non-participant observation within the participants' clinical environment and self-reported activity logs. FINDINGS: Five key themes emerged: use of advanced physical <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> varied; use and development of skills was linked to personal characteristics; use influenced by perceptions of role boundaries, permission and cooperation; use influenced by participants' perception of nursing and the development of their own nursing practice; and use influenced by the physical environment and the human support within it. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Cardiac nurses selectively use physical <b>assessment</b> <b>skills,</b> predominately related to the cardiorespiratory systems. Organisational structure, professional relationships and the professionalism of the individual nurse appear to play a significant part in the use of physical <b>assessment</b> <b>skills.</b> Although the findings from this qualitative study cannot be generalized, they concur with findings from recent research into physical <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> used by a variety of UK nurses. The implications identified are: first, for those who provide the education, in terms of what should be taught and facilitated; and second, for organizations, in ensuring staff have <b>assessment</b> <b>skills</b> relevant to their role and that systems are in place to enable the development of a supportive and progressive culture that embraces modernization congruent with healthcare policy...|$|E
