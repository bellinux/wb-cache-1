40|$|AbstractThis study {{proposed}} two plausible models regarding these inter-relationships: 1) The {{first model}} posited {{a positive relationship}} between (i) organizational justice <b>and</b> OCB, (ii) <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> OCB, and (iii) work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>stress.</b> This first model indicates that the variables OCB <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> mediate between organizational justice and work-family conflict. 2) The second model proposes {{a positive relationship between}} (i) organizational justice and OCB, (ii) work-family conflict and OCB, and (iii) work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>stress.</b> This second model points to OCB and work-family conflict as mediators between organizational justice <b>and</b> <b>stress.</b> In sum, drawing upon Arab respondents, our findings partially supported both conceptual models: in both models, the first and third hypotheses were confirmed, namely, that positive associations exist, respectively, between organizational justice and OCB and between work-family conflict <b>and</b> <b>stress.</b> However, for each model a significant negative, rather than positive, association was found for the second hypothesis that predicted a positive correlation between OCB <b>and</b> <b>stress...</b>|$|R

5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained <b>and</b> <b>stressed,</b> supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E

Materials and methods: From September 2014 to October 2014, a cross-sectional study was conducted among higher secondary school students of Imphal. The sample size was calculated to be 750. Seven schools were randomly selected, and all the students in that school were enrolled in the study. The study tool used was a questionnaire containing DASS (Depression Anxiety <b>Stress</b> Scale) <b>and</b> sociodemographic characteristics. Results: The prevalences of depression, anxiety, <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> among 830 valid respondents were 19. 5 %, 24. 4 %, and 21. 1 %, respectively. In total, 81. 6 % of the respondents had {{at least one of the}} studied disorders and 34. 7 % of the respondents had all the three negative states.

40|$|Background: Traumatic {{injury and}} mental health {{disorders}} are co-associated. Early identification of depression, anxiety <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> following injury, <b>and</b> subsequent preventive intervention, may reduce the long-term symptoms and negative impacts associated with depression and anxiety. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the incidence, severity and predictors of depression, anxiety <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> in injured patients in the acute phase of care, and at six months following injury, as well as the effectiveness of an in-hospital screening tool. Methods: This descriptive longitudinal study of trauma patients was conducted at a Level 1 Metropolitan Trauma Centre in Australia over 14 months. Participants were interviewed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale short-form version (DASS- 21) during hospital admission then at 3 and 6 months after injury. Descriptive statistics were performed to evaluate participant characteristics and incidence of depression, anxiety <b>and</b> <b>stress.</b> Correlations <b>and</b> logistic regression were conducted to investigate the ability of the DASS- 21 to predict symptoms of depression, anxiety <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> to investigate factors associated with depression, anxiety <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> 6 months after injury. Results: 201 participants ranging in age (18 – 94 years) and injury severity participated in the baseline interview and 109 completed all 3 interviews over 6 months. Over half (54 %) reported above normal scores for depression, anxiety and/or stress in at least one of the 3 time points. Intensive care unit admission and high levels of depression, anxiety <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> at 3 months post injury were predictors for high levels of depression, anxiety <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> at 6 months. Low scores for depression, anxiety <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> during admission were correlated with low scores for depression, anxiety <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> at 3 <b>and</b> 6 months. Conclusion: Depression, anxiety <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> in patients hospitalised following injury is common and should be anticipated in patients who have had an intensive care admission.

5|$|Two {{documents}} survive of the barons' complaints. In {{the first}} of these, the barons reiterated {{the background of the}} conflict, <b>and</b> <b>stressed</b> the fact that the king himself had accepted the conditions of the provisions. Henry had in fact, in an effort to gain public support, pledged to uphold the provisions, a fact that was now made the most of. The document further goes on to explain the reform instituted by the baronial council. In order to restore law and peacekeeping to the country, the council had installed a new Chief Justiciar and Chancellor. They had also appointed new sheriffs in the counties, who were to be directly accountable to the government and be replaced annually. The king had violated these conditions, it was argued, when he had appointed his own chancellor and a number of sheriffs. He had also taken over custody of Winchester Castle, which had been given over to Montfort by the provisions. Furthermore, there were accusation made against individual royal adherents, such as Roger Mortimer for his military raids in the Welsh Marches. The second document goes into more detail on the king's alleged transgressions. By extortionate taxation, it was claimed, Henry had impoverished the land. He had also infringed the liberties of the Church, violated Magna Carta, and corrupted justice.|$|E

The studio suffered several setbacks during {{the sequence of events}} that led up to the creation of Burnout 3, including the cancellation of a project, a failed pitch, and a fall out with the game's eventual publisher Electronic Arts (EA). In 2002, Criterion was around 130 people divided into two development teams. One team was working on Burnout 2: Point of Impact, a follow up to Burnout, set to be published by Acclaim Entertainment. The other team had completed the development of the extreme sports game AirBlade for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Sony had intentions of continuing to collaborate with Criterion on a sequel to AirBlade, however the AirBlade team turned down the offer. Instead, Criterion began talks with EA, who had a proposal for Criterion to create a remake of the 1988 skateboarding video game Skate or Die!. Criterion were keen to work with EA and started development on the project. Following Burnout 2s release, Criterion prepared a pitch to EA Canada about working on a second game with the publisher. Criterion's proposed title was Need For Speed: Split Second, a stunt racing game within EA's Need for Speed series. Meanwhile, the Skate of Die! remake project was thrown into disarray when EA requested changes to the game's design and the creative direction of project shifted away from Criterion's vision.

5|$|The people {{involved}} in the Oregon track and field program have led changes that benefited professional athletes and coaches, as well as running enthusiasts. Bill Bowerman experimented with many coaching techniques during his time as a head coach at the University of Oregon and instilled many of his principles from his days as a Major in the US Army. For example, Bowerman pioneered in using film as a method of teaching technique to his athletes. With Bowerman's meticulous attention to details, he made other discoveries with regards to coaching track. The training schedules he developed for his athletes ran counter to many other coaches' principles at the time. He believed that each individual athlete was different and tailored different workout routines to different athletes. He also scaled his workouts up and down, giving some of his athletes rest on certain days for recovery time. This attention to detail also led him to become obsessed with experimentation of reducing the weight of his athletes' apparel and increasing the traction of their shoes which eventually {{led to the creation of}} the apparel company Nike. Moreover, Bowerman considered himself more of a teacher than a coach <b>and</b> <b>stressed</b> schoolwork as well as mentoring his athletes with regards to life. Tom Heinonen, the former head coach of the Oregon women's track and field program was a strong advocate of female athletics at a time when female athletics were largely an afterthought. Steve Prefontaine was vehemently outspoken against the Amateur Athletic Union. Kenny Moore, a former University of Oregon student who ran track under Bowerman, was one of the speakers at the President's Commission on Olympic Sports, a series of hearings regarding amateur sports. These efforts along with those from other amateur athletes eventually culminated in the passage of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978.|$|E
