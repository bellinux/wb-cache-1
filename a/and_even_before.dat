5|$|The Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 was {{the final}} and most devastating of the series of wars fought between the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire and the Sasanian Empire of Persia. The {{previous}} war between the two powers had ended in 591 after Emperor Maurice helped the Sasanian king Khosrow II regain his throne. In 602 Maurice was murdered by his political rival Phocas. Khosrow proceeded to declare war, ostensibly to avenge the death of Maurice. This became a decades-long conflict, the longest war in the series, and was fought throughout the Middle East: in Egypt, the Levant, Mesopotamia, the Caucasus, Anatolia, Armenia, the Aegean Sea <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>before</b> the walls of Constantinople itself.|$|E

25|$|Within the {{limestone}} areas of Wales, there have arisen karstic landscapes during the postglacial period, though elements {{of these were}} initiated during <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>before</b> successive ice ages. Limestone pavements are best developed along the 'north crop' within the Brecon Beacons National Park and there are numerous sinkholes and shakeholes, together with sinks, sections of dry valley and resurgences. Cave development is extensive and includes systems such as Ogof Ffynnon Ddu (Britain's deepest cave), Dan-yr-ogof (partly showcave) and Wales' most extensive system Ogof Draenen.|$|E

25|$|Viral DNA can be {{detected}} by PCR. The primers used must be specific to the targeted sequences in the DNA of a virus, and PCR {{can be used for}} diagnostic analyses or DNA sequencing of the viral genome. The high sensitivity of PCR permits virus detection soon after infection <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>before</b> the onset of disease. Such early detection may give physicians a significant lead time in treatment. The amount of virus ("viral load") in a patient can also be quantified by PCR-based DNA quantitation techniques (see below).|$|E
25|$|The Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple, {{located in}} Melkote built on rocky hills is a square {{building}} of large dimensions but very plain, dedicated to Lord Cheluva-Narayana Swamy or Tirunarayana. Mysore Archaeological Department states, {{on the strength}} of epigraphic evidence, that the presiding deity of this temple was already a well known idol of worship before Sri Ramanujacharya, the Srivaishnava saint worshipped at the shrine in December 1098 <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>before</b> he came to the Mysore region and that very probably he used his influence to rebuild or renovate the temple. The temple is richly endowed, having been under the special patronage of the Mysore Wodeyars, and has a most valuable collection of jewels.|$|E
25|$|With the war having turned decisively {{against the}} Central Powers, {{the people of}} Austria-Hungary lost faith in their allied countries, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>before</b> the {{armistice}} in November, radical nationalism had already led to several declarations of independence in south-central Europe after November 1918. As the central government had ceased to operate in vast areas, these regions found themselves without a government and many new groups attempted to fill the void. During this same period, the population was facing food shortages and was, for the most part, demoralized by the losses incurred during the war. Various political parties, ranging from ardent nationalists, to social democrats, to communists attempted to set up governments {{in the names of}} the different nationalities. In other areas, existing nation states such as Romania engaged regions that they considered to be theirs. These moves created de facto governments that complicated life for diplomats, idealists, and the Western allies.|$|E

25|$|In 839, with Emperor Wenzong being seriously ill, his {{favorite}} concubine Consort Yang recommended his brother Li Rong the Prince of An as crown prince—a move {{that was later}} suspected to be supported by Yang Sifu, {{who appeared to be}} her nephew. Li Jue, however, was opposed. Instead, Emperor Wenzong created Emperor Jingzong's youngest son Li Chengmei the Prince of Chen crown prince. However, when Emperor Wenzong became even more ill in 840, Chou and Yu, wanting to use this opportunity to control the imperial succession, had an edict issued in Emperor Wenzong's name creating another brother of his, Li Chan the Prince of Ying, crown prince instead. Emperor Wenzong soon died, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>before</b> Li Chan took the throne formally, Consort Yang, Li Rong, and Li Chengmei were ordered to commit suicide, and many eunuchs and musicians who were personally close to Emperor Wenzong were either killed or exiled. Li Chan then took the throne (as Emperor Wuzong).|$|E
25|$|The 1965 Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway {{was one of}} {{the wildest}} races in NASCAR history. Rookie driver Buren Skeen died after two cars ran into the side of his car in the early laps. Sam McQuagg was leading the race, when Cale Yarborough tried to muscle past McQuagg for the lead. Yarborough flew over the guardrail, rolled around six times, and ended {{up at the end of}} the parking lot by a light post. Yarborough waved to the crowd as he walked back to the pits. A video clip of the wreck was used on ABC's Wide World of Sports for several years. With 44 laps left, Fred Lorenzen and Darel Dieringer were {{fighting}} for the lead far ahead of Jarrett. Lorenzen's motor expired, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>before</b> he could get into the pits Dieringer's motor started smoking too. Dieringer continued at a slower pace to finish third. The race was won by Ned Jarrett by 14 laps and 2 car lengths or 19.25 miles, which is the farthest margin of victory in NASCAR history (in terms of miles).|$|E
500|$|The dodo appears {{frequently}} in works of popular fiction, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>before</b> its extinction, it {{was featured in}} European literature, as symbol for exotic lands, and of gluttony, due to its apparent fatness. In 1865, {{the same year that}} George Clark started to publish reports about excavated dodo fossils, the newly vindicated bird was featured as a character in Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. It is thought that he included the dodo because he identified with it and had adopted the name as a nickname for himself because of his stammer, which made him accidentally introduce himself as [...] "Do-do-dodgson", his legal surname. The book's popularity made the dodo a well-known icon of extinction.|$|E

500|$|In {{the other}} semi-final, Maguire ended O'Sullivan's 14-match unbeaten {{run with a}} 6–1 victory to earn {{a place in the}} final against Higgins. Maguire made century breaks in the first two frames, {{becoming}} the first player to make five consecutive century breaks (including the three made in his previous match). Maguire won the third on the pink after O'Sullivan missed the yellow. O'Sullivan won the next with a break of 51, before Maguire made a break of 71 in each of the final two frames. After the match, O'Sullivan—who had won all three previous encounters against Maguire—said, [...] "I've never seen anything like that on a snooker table before... He's a great player, probably {{the best in the world}} at the moment", <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>before</b> the match, O'Sullivan had described Maguire as [...] "of the young ones, definitely the best". The defeat meant that Reardon lost the £100 bet he placed at 150–1 that O'Sullivan would win all eight of the season's ranking events.|$|E
500|$|Tess Harper was {{performing}} {{on stage in}} Texas when she attended a casting call for a minor role in the film. Beresford {{was so impressed with}} her that he cast her in the lead. He later said that the actresses he had seen before her demonstrated a sophistication and worldliness inappropriate for the part, while she brought a kind of rural quality without coming across as simple or foolish. Beresford said of Harper, [...] "She walked into the room <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>before</b> she spoke, I thought, 'That's the girl to play the lead. Harper said she knew she won the role when Beresford appeared on her doorstep with a bottle of champagne in each hand. Tender Mercies was Harper's feature film debut, and she was so excited about the role she bit her script {{to make sure it was}} real.

In December 1814, with the armies of Napoleon Bonaparte apparently defeated, and the British invasions of New York and Baltimore thwarted, British and American diplomats signed the Treaty of Ghent. It called {{for a return to}} the borders of 1812 with no gains or losses. [...] Before the treaty reached the Senate for ratification, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>before</b> news of its signing reached New Orleans, a massive British invasion force was utterly defeated in January 1815 at the Battle of New Orleans, making a national hero of General Andrew Jackson.

Following her dance teacher's recommendation, she was invited to appear in the music video of Renoo Nathan's [...] "Thirakti Kyun Hawa". Shot in Banaras, the video was seen by Ramoji Films who offered her the lead role of Neha in their film Ishtam. Saran accepted the part <b>and,</b> <b>even</b> <b>before</b> it was released she was signed to four more films, including Nuvve Nuvve, in which she played a millionaire's daughter who falls for a middle-class man. In 2002, she starred in Santosham, co-starring Nagarjuna, Prabhu Deva and Gracy Singh, which was her first commercial success. The film took the Nandi Award for Best Feature Film and Filmfare Best Film Award (Telugu). Saran played a woman who lets someone she loves go with another, but wins him back later in life. For her performance, she earned a nomination for the CineMAA Award for Best Actor- Female, giving her a good foothold in the Telugu industry in the early part of her career.|$|E
