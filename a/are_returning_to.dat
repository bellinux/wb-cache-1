During the trip, Lad playfully teases a bear, leading to a fight, which the master ends by scaring off the bear. At {{the end of the}} trip, Lad is accidentally left tied to a tree at the camp site. While his owners <b>are</b> <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> find their missing dog, Lad is trapped by a forest fire. When the bear he fought earlier rushes past with singed fur, Lad chews through his rope and follows the other animals of the forest to sit in a nearby lake. When his owners arrive, he runs through the burning fire to join them, blistering his paws on some coals.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of the fourth edition, Wizards of the Coast {{introduced}} its Game System License, which represented a significant restriction compared to the very open policies embodied by the OGL. In part as a response to this, some publishers (such as Paizo Publishing with its Pathfinder Roleplaying Game) who previously produced materials in support of the D product line, decided to continue supporting the 3rd Edition rules, thereby competing directly with Wizards of the Coast. Others, such as Kenzer & Company, <b>are</b> <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> the practice of publishing unlicensed supplements and arguing that copyright law does not allow Wizards of the Coast to restrict third-party usage.|$|E

Although the four still retain an adult mind, the crew have trouble taking them seriously, and Picard (David Tristan Birkin) is convinced by Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) to temporarily relinquish command of the ship. After turning over command of the Enterprise to Commander William Riker, Picard ponders resigning his Starfleet commission, albeit temporarily, in order to pursue other interests. Meanwhile, Keiko (Caroline Junko King) is dismayed by her husband Miles's (Colm Meaney) reluctance {{to be with her}} and is further saddened her daughter (Hana Hatae) does not recognize her. While Ro (Megan Parlen) is at first upset after being reminded of her unpleasant childhood, once Guinan's (Isis Carmen Jones) enthusiasm causes her to soften, the duo begin jumping on a bed and other childish pursuits.|$|E

25|$|Although her novels were {{hugely popular}} during her lifetime, Burney's {{reputation}} as a writer of fiction suffered after her death {{at the hands of}} biographers and critics, who felt that the extensive diaries, published posthumously in 1842–46, offered a more interesting and accurate portrait of 18th-century life. Today critics <b>are</b> <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> her novels and plays with renewed interest in her outlook on the social lives and struggles of women in a predominantly male-oriented culture. Scholars continue to value Burney's diaries as well for their candid depictions of English society in her time.|$|E

In more recent years, Artscroll has collaborated with Sephardic community leaders in an attempt to bridge this gap.

Although impacted by the Great Recession, NWA's economy fared better than most peer metropolitan areas, the state of Arkansas and the United States overall. Between 2007 and 2013, the region saw unemployment rates significantly below those of peer regions and the national average; while also seeing a 1% net growth of jobs. The NWA gross domestic product grew 7.0% over the aforementioned time period, and bankruptcies, building permits and per capita incomes <b>are</b> <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> pre-Recession rates.|$|E

They also travel to the Buried City, the birthplace of many technological wonders where they discover an AI that used to be linked to the Warmind of Mars, but is now controlled by Rasputin.

25|$|In 1961, the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge {{was founded}} by congressional order. That {{paved the way for}} tighter {{restrictions}} on industries and allocated substantial amounts of government funding to clean up the river. However, there was little support toward cleaning up the river, because it would negatively affect Detroit's industrialism and economy. In 1970, the entire fishing industry in the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, the Detroit River, and Lake Erie had to be closed due to toxic levels of mercury found in the water. This, in turn, spurred a massive conservation effort aimed at cleaning up the Detroit River. For years before, conservation efforts were halted by the enormous multimillion-dollar cost of removing pollutants from the river. In addition to that, industries, which had significant political influence, detested the regulations necessary to lessen the amount of pollutants in the river. In 2001, the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge was absorbed into the much larger Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge, which is a cooperative effort between the United States and Canada to preserve the area as an ecological refuge. Millions of dollars so far have been used to dredge pollutants out of the river, and the recent cleaning up and restoration of the Detroit River is remarkable, although other problems are still at hand. Today, many species of native animals <b>are</b> <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> the area after being driven out by human development. The Detroit River is home to a growing number of bird species, such as eagles (including reintroduced bald eagles), ospreys, and peregrine falcons. Fish species in abundance in the area include lake whitefish, sturgeon, silver bass, black bass, salmon, perch, and walleye. The Detroit River was designated as an American Heritage River in 1998 and a Canadian Heritage River in 2001 — the only river to have dual designations.|$|E

C. Robert Cargill of Ain't It Cool News adds that only those over 35, [...] "who have savings accounts and weren't tapped out by Christmas," [...] can afford {{to go to the}} movies regularly then.

500|$|At {{the same}} time as the current work mandate, No.410 Squadron is also {{responsible}} for training and re-certifying about five former CF-18 Hornet pilots annually. These pilots <b>are</b> <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> the CF-18 after a ground or exchange tour. No.410 Squadron also trains newly arrived foreign exchange officers who will be joining one of Canada's two operational fighter squadrons. As backgrounds can differ significantly, each course is tailored to the individual, based on their experience and demonstrated competencies. Areas covered in depth in the Fighter Pilot Course (FPC) include basic and advanced aircraft handling, instrument flight, formation flying, night flying, all-weather interception, air-to-air refuelling, Basic Fighter Manoeuvres (BFM – [...] "dogfighting skills") and air combat. The latter half of each FPC comprises academic air-to-ground weapons delivery and Close Air Support (CAS), as well as advanced Air Interdiction (AI) tactics, the former usually completed during a squadron deployment to the south-western United States in the late spring and early fall, due to the significantly better weather and the sheer number of bombing ranges available.|$|E
500|$|Cooper's most {{important}} film during the post-war years was Fred Zinnemann's Western drama High Noon (1952) with Grace Kelly for United Artists. In the film, Cooper plays retiring sheriff Will Kane who {{is preparing to}} leave town on his honeymoon when he learns that an outlaw he helped put away and his three henchmen <b>are</b> <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> seek their revenge. Unable to gain {{the support of the}} frightened townspeople, and abandoned by his young bride, Kane nevertheless stays to face the outlaws alone. During the filming, Cooper was in poor health and in considerable pain from stomach ulcers. His ravaged face and discomfort in some scenes [...] "photographed as self-doubt", according to biographer Hector Arce, and contributed to the effectiveness of his performance. Considered one of the first [...] "adult" [...] Westerns for its theme of moral courage, High Noon received enthusiastic reviews for its artistry, with Time magazine placing it in the ranks of Stagecoach and The Gunfighter. Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, [...] wrote that Cooper was [...] "at the top of his form", and John McCarten, in The New Yorker, wrote that Cooper was never more effective. The film earned $3.75 million in the United States and $18 million worldwide. Following the example of his friend James Stewart, Cooper accepted a lower salary in exchange for a percent of the profits, and ended up making $600,000. Cooper's understated performance was widely praised, and earned him his second Academy Award for Best Actor.|$|E
