5|$|In Mozambique, Domoina dropped heavy {{rainfall}} {{in the capital}} Maputo that accounted for 40% of the <b>annual</b> <b>total.</b> Floods in the country destroyed over 50small dams and left widespread crop damage just before the summer harvest. Later, the rains caused the worst flooding in over 20years in Swaziland, which damaged or destroyed more than 100bridges. Disrupted transport left areas isolated for several days. In South Africa, rainfall peaked at 950mm (37in), which flooded 29river basins, notably the Pongola River which altered its course after the storm. Flooding caused the Pongolapoort Dam to reach 87% of its capacity; when waters were released to maintain the structural integrity, additional flooding occurred in Mozambique, forcing thousands to evacuate. Throughout the region, Domoina caused widespread flooding that damaged houses, roads, and crops, leaving about $199million in damage. There were 242deaths in southeastern Africa.|$|E
5|$|The mild seas that {{surround}} Portland act to keep night-time temperatures above freezing, making winter frost rare: on average 9.6 days per year— {{this is far}} below the United Kingdom's average <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> of 55.6 days of frost.

Trends for birch pollen and oak pollen are increasing, but not significant at the stations with the higher <b>annual</b> <b>totals</b> (Delmenhorst and Helmond),probably due to strong year-to-year fluctuations. At all five stations significant increasing trends for stinging nettle pollen were observed. Trends for mugwort pollen are significant at all stations, but in different directions.
