Forty‐nine dogs from a kennel with a history of a cardiomyopathy were assessed clinically, electrocardiographically and radiographically. Angiography, haemodynamic and post‐mortem examinations were carried out on selected dogs. On electrocardiographic (ECG) and radiographic criteria the dogs were classified into five groups. Twenty‐six dogs (Group 1) were normal. Seven dogs (Group 2) showed ECG changes compatible with left or biventricular hypertrophy in the absence of radiographic abnormality. This was interpreted as concentric hypertrophy. Seven dogs (Group 3) showed ECG and radiographic evidence of cardiac hypertrophy with five of the seven exhibiting enlargement of both chambers. The changes were considered to be compatible with eccentric hypertrophy. Post‐mortem findings in dogs with ECG characteristics of Groups 2 and 3 have shown concentric hypertrophy in three cases and eccentric hypertrophy in one case. Six dogs (Group 4) had right <b>axis</b> <b>deviations.</b> Three dogs (Group 5) showed left <b>axis</b> <b>deviations.</b> It is suggested that a cardiomyopathy exists in English Cocker Spaniels initially developing as a concentric hypertrophy and progressing to eccentric hypertrophy.

Disease progression may involve structural remodeling of muscle tissue. An effect on molecular motorprotein function may also be possible.

Myofibril tilting, twisting, and local <b>axis</b> <b>deviations</b> explain at least up to 20 % of force drop during unsynchronized contractile activation as judged from cosine angle sums of myofibril orientations within mdx fibers. In contrast, in vitro motility assays showed unaltered sliding velocities of single mdx fiber myosin extracts. Closer quantification of the microarchitecture revealed that dystrophic fibers had significantly more Y-shaped sarcomere irregularities (‘‘verniers’’) than wild-type fibers (~ 130 / 1000 mm 3 vs. ~ 36 / 1000 mm 3). In transgenic mini-dystrophin-expressing fibers, ultrastructure was restored (~ 38 / 1000 mm 3 counts). We suggest that in aged dystrophic toe muscle, progressive force loss is reflected by a vastly deranged micromorphology that prevents a coordinated and aligned contraction.

40|$|Secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) is {{the most}} common type of ASD within the {{spectrum}} of congenital cardiac abnormalities in children. In this retrospective study the data on 75 patients with a pure secundum ASD were analysed. The male/female ratio was 1 : 1. 3. This is less than the reported male/female ratio of 1 : 2. The symptoms most often found were shortness of breath, cough and susceptibility to fatigue. An ejection systolic heart murmur was found in the majority of the patients. A fixed split second heart sound was only found in 49 % of patients. This could have been the result of incomplete documentation, inexperienced clinicians, a fast heart rate or the fact that a split second heart sound is not always present in patients with ASDs. On the chest radiograph the majority of patients presented with right ventricular enlargement, right atrial enlargement and increased pulmonary blood flow. A relatively unexpected finding on echocardiography was left atrial enlargement. This is usually caused by volume overload in the presence of large ASDs. Another unexpected finding was the high number of left QRS-axis deviations (10 %) and indeterminate QRS- <b>axis</b> <b>deviations,</b> left rotation (7 %) present on the electrocardiogram. This finding is much higher than the reported 3. 8 % of left QRS-axis deviation present in patients with secundum ASDs.

40|$|AbstractZygotes and embryos of the fucoid brown algaPelvetia compressaundergo {{a series}} of {{asymmetric}} cleavages. We {{are interested in the}} developmental role of these cleavages and the mechanism controlling their alignment. To assess the importance of division plane alignment, the orientation of the first asymmetric division was altered and the effects on subsequent embryo elongation rates were analyzed. Although this division is normally oriented transversely (90 °) to the growth <b>axis,</b> <b>deviations</b> up to 45 ° had no significant effects on embryo elongation. However, division planes that were parallel with the growth axis (0 – 45 °) had drastic effects. Embryo elongation was severely inhibited and the wall often bifurcated and avoided the rhizoid tip. The orientation of the division plane is determined by the position of the centrosomes. We therefore investigated centrosomal position and function during the first cell cycle within the three-dimensional context of the cell. We found that, after karyogamy, microtubule organization changed from a radially symmetric circumnuclear array into a bipolar centrosomal array. The reorganization coincided with the migration of the centrosomes around the nucleus. The centrosomes separated slowly and asynchronously until they reached opposite sides of the nuclear envelope. At this time the centrosomal axis, defined by the position of the two centrosomes, was oriented randomly with respect to the cortical growth axis. The centrosomal axis then rotated into alignment parallel with the growth axis late in the first cell cycle. These results indicate that the growth axis and the centrosomal axis develop independently of each other and that the centrosomal axis does not align with the growth axis until just prior to mitosis...|$|R
