5|$|That day we saw horror, but we {{also saw}} quiet acts of courage. We saw this courage in a teacher named Liviu Librescu. With the gunman set to enter his class, this brave {{professor}} blocked the door with his body while his students fled to safety. On the Day of Remembrance, this Holocaust survivor gave his own life so that others may live. And this morning we honor his memory <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> strength from his example.|$|E
5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

2500|$|Brothel {{industry}} lobbyist George Flint disagreed, saying [...] "Anybody {{that has}} an ounce of brain or intelligence has to know they (legal and illegal prostitution) are two different things. We don't traffic women. We don't hire trafficked women. We don't work with pimps. We treat the girls with respect and dignity <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> care of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{called it}} a [...] "fine, moving, {{frequently}} hilarious tale" [...] and observed it [...] "is an American comedy {{of the sort of}} vitality that dazzles European film critics <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> for granted. It's full of attachments and associations to very particular times and places, even in the various regional accents of its characters. It's beautifully written…and acted, but it's not especially neatly tailored… At the center of the movie and giving it a visible sensibility is Miss Burstyn, one of the few actresses at work today…who is able to seem appealing, tough, intelligent, funny, and bereft, all at approximately the same moment. It's Miss Burstyn's movie and part of the enjoyment of the film is in the director's apparent awareness of this fact… Two other performances must be noted, those of Diane Ladd and Valerie Curtin… Their marvelous contributions in small roles are a measure of the film's quality and of Mr. Scorsese's fully realized talents {{as one of the best}} of the new American film-makers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Refugee management: European Union is {{presently}} facing the humanitarian consequences of NATO-led 'democracy' promotion agenda which severely destabilized Syria, Libya, Iraq, Yemen and Afghanistan. Abject living conditions and unsafe security situation has driven civilians to vote with their feet, resulting in mass exodus from Europe's periphery. The massive inflow of migrants fleeing civil wars has exposed fundamentally discordant perspectives on an unified EU approach and {{course of action}} to manage the crisis. Eastern and Northern European countries show no urgency to increase their intake of refugees to alleviate the burden on crisis response services in southern EU member states (especially Italy & Greece) who are overburdened with the relentless arrival of refugees. The United Nations demanded that European Union countries {{live up to their}} responsibilities to accept migrant outflows. NGOs have expressed shock at the treatment of refugees in Europe. Northern European and former Communist EU member states like Poland, Slovakia and Hungary whose populations are less multi-ethnic than most Western European countries are reluctant to accept migrants. Radical steps were taken to secure internal borders against migrants : Hungary and Bulgaria opted for razor-wire fences [...] while Austria deployed its army. Far-right political parties and neo-fascist movements (Austria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland and Sweden) have opposed the arrival and resettlement of refugees. Poland's Janusz Korwin-Mikke, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), claimed that EU migrants were: [...] "people coming to Poland and the whole Europe just to live off handouts. People willing to work are valuable, but they are being sent back to their countries <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> in those unwilling to work. This is a ridiculous policy that results in Europe being flooded with human garbage. Let's state this clear: human garbage that doesn't want to work". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose country hosts the most number of refugees fleeing Syria was scathing in his assessment of the European Union's management of refugees and migrants: [...] "European countries, which turned the Mediterranean Sea -- the cradle of ancient civilisations -- into a migrant cemetery are party to the crime that takes place when each refugee loses their life,". UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said that he was [...] "shocked" [...] that tear gas and water cannons were used by Hungarian police to force migrants away from its border and declared that such treatment of asylum seekers was [...] "unacceptable". The mass exodus, provoked by German Chancellor Angela Merkel's unilateral announcement that Germany will accept Syrian refugees irrespective of where they entered the European Union, and the subsequent slamming shut of Germany's borders to refugees, left many to wonder if the crisis was a political stunt to shift global media attention away from the adverse publicity to the German Chancellor following the debt default by Greece. By March 2016, a significant number of EU countries flatly rejected Germany's plans for a quota based EU-wide refugee redistribution and resettlement scheme besides refusing to bear the consequences of Angela Merkel's unilateral actions. Eastern European countries shoved-away the refugee crisis as Germany's problem and threatened to defy Germany through legal and electoral challenges. The refugee crisis has left Angela Merkel politically isolated in Europe. Amid economic decline, European citizens are increasingly concerned about their living standards and care less about ideology and moral discourses.|$|E
