Ashcroft on behalf of Nicholas Merrill, owner of an Internet service provider.

5|$|In July 2015, Newsom {{released}} {{the final report}} of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Marijuana Policy, which he had convened with the <b>American</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> <b>Union</b> of California in 2013.

5|$|While at {{one time}} a long-time {{supporter}} of the <b>American</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> <b>Union,</b> Hentoff became a vocal critic of the organization in 1999 for its advocacy of government-enforced university and workplace speech codes. He {{served on the board}} of advisors for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, another civil liberties group. Hentoff's book Free Speech for Me—But Not for Thee outlines his views on free speech and excoriates those whom he feels favor censorship in any form.|$|E

5|$|The ACLU {{continues}} to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly {{treated by the}} government. Often the <b>American</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> <b>Union</b> is the group {{to stand up for}} an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, race, or class, even when they are not the popular opinion. The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes deeper than the ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing lessons about contraception, knowing about one's reproductive rights and assisting with the financial burdens of abortions and all of the logistics that may go into that.|$|E
5|$|The Free Expression Policy Project {{was founded}} by Marjorie Heins, who became its initial director. It was formed as a nonprofit {{organization}}. Founded in 2000, the organization formed with goals of assisting researchers with assembling information related to freedom of speech, media democracy, and copyright, and advocating for these issues. It started as {{an outgrowth of the}} National Coalition Against Censorship. Prior to founding the organization, Heins served as director of the Art Censorship Project at the <b>American</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> <b>Union.</b> The FEPP monitors incidents of censorship against artists, and is based in Manhattan, New York.|$|E
5|$|After the {{revolution}} in Russia in 1917, the communist movement gradually gained footholds in many countries around the world. In Europe and the US, communist parties were formed, generally allied with trade union and labor causes. During the First Red Scare of 1919–1920, many Americans were fearful that Bolshevism and anarchism would lead to disruption within the US. In the late 1930s, state and federal legislatures passed laws designed to expose communists, including laws requiring loyalty oaths, and laws requiring communists to register with the government. Even the <b>American</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> <b>Union</b> (ACLU), a free-speech advocacy organization, passed a resolution in 1939 expelling communists from its leadership ranks.|$|E
