40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{consists}} in describing and analyzing the state of implementation of <b>anti-drug</b> <b>policy</b> of the Government of the Czech Republic {{at the local level}} and in proposing possible measures to improve such state. Specifically, the Cheb region in Karlovy Vary Region is involved. In this bachelor's thesis, the <b>anti-drug</b> <b>policy</b> is described in its basic approaches, principles, international cooperation and institutional background and important documents. In the thesis, we also deal with the issue of the Czech drug scene, how and by which it was influenced, and how it was reflected in the <b>anti-drug</b> <b>policy</b> of the Czech Republic. It is later described in more detail in its coordination, strategy a respective documents. At the regional level, the thesis analyses the state of implementation of <b>anti-drug</b> <b>policy</b> of the Government of the Czech Republic, in particular with regard to its coordination and institutional background. The identified weaknesses of implementation of <b>anti-drug</b> <b>policy</b> in the Cheb region include financing drug services, lack of interest of the political representatives of cities and communities in <b>anti-drug</b> <b>policy,</b> non-existence of a specialized subsequent care facility and specialized out-patient care for people addicted to drugs, existence of a single K-centre in the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|U. S. {{strategy}} {{against the}} production and distribution of illegal drugs in and from source countries uses both supply and demand side <b>anti-drug</b> <b>policies</b> {{with the aim of}} increasing drug prices. In source countries, the trends for potential drug production (or area cultivated with coca and opium poppy leaves) and trafficking activities, together with wholesale prices for cocaine (and heroin) in the U. S, show no clear results supporting the success of the strategy. Moreover, the existence of these illegal industries has been an important factor in the development of rebel movements. This paper presents a possible explanation for the correlations between both <b>anti-drug</b> <b>policies</b> and these trends, by analyzing the illicit drug production and distribution together with the existence of rebel movements. By accounting for the interaction between a rebel movement, a drug lord, and a government, is possible to explain the effects of each of these two <b>anti-drug</b> <b>policies,</b> their relative effectiveness, and the reasons behind their use. The analysis suggests that demand oriented <b>anti-drug</b> <b>policies</b> can produce better results than supply oriented policies. illegal behavior; conflict; law enforcement...|$|R

The EU has unveiled plans to tackle these problems. Strasbourg, 25 October 2011 – The European Commission has today given a fresh impetus to <b>anti-drugs</b> <b>policy</b> by announcing an overhaul of the EU rules to fight illicit drugs, particularly new psychoactive substances, which imitate the effects of dangerous drugs like ecstasy or cocaine and are a growing problem. The EU indentified a record number of 41 such substances in 2010, up from 24 the previous year. These drugs are increasingly available over the internet and have rapidly spread in many Member States, which face difficulties in preventing their sale. More new drugs are entering the market. Over the past two years, one new substance has emerged every week. Member States cannot stop the spread of drugs alone: clampdowns at national level may simply force criminals to move drug production to neighbouring countries or to shift trafficking routes. With the Lisbon Treaty now in place, the EU has new tools to address the drugs scourge. Over the coming months, the Commission will develop clearer and stronger rules on tackling dangerous new drugs and trafficking – both of illicit drugs and chemicals used to make them...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to tell the untold story of the ascendance of Mexican DTOs over the {{production}} and distribution of methamphetamine. By adding this dimension to {{a story that has}} typically focused on the role of Mexican DTOs in the cocaine trade, it explains the spread of meth use in the U. S. and the challenges currently facing U. S. law enforcement officials attempting to combat the illegal methamphetamine trade. It concludes that the trick is to formulate international <b>anti-drug</b> <b>policy</b> that incorporates the "balloon effect" and anticipates {{the creation of a new}} challenge even as the old one is being laid low. If nothing else, the untold story of how the Mexican cartels rose to monopolize the methamphetamine trade in the United States demonstrates that the formulation of <b>anti-drug</b> <b>policy</b> needs to bridge the gap between tactical success and strategic failure. Drug lords come and drug lords go but the war on drugs goes on. If real progress is to be made, then the specifics, such as the story of how the Mexican DTOs took over the methamphetamine trade needs to be told and retold and integrated into the broader <b>anti-drug</b> <b>policy</b> initiative of the day.

50|$|In 2005, the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform took {{an active}} {{interest}} on <b>anti-drug</b> <b>policies</b> {{in professional sports}} by opening {{an investigation into the}} matter following heightened media activity on steroid use in Major League Baseball (MLB). The use, possession, distribution, dispensing, or selling of steroids is a punishable federal offense under the Controlled Substances Act which, in addition to steroids, lists other performance-enhancing drugs and substances as Schedule III drugs. A series of hearings were held, most notably with MLB, the National Football League (NFL), and the National Basketball Association (NBA). Each league’s <b>anti-drug</b> <b>policy</b> was compared to that of the IOC, and each fell short of the IOC requirements. Response to the congressional investigation by sports league representatives resulted largely with push back and a “we can police our own” mentality, but the Committee felt differently and introduced the Clean Sports Act—one of six bills introduced that year in both chambers —addressing the need to adopt uniform national <b>anti-drug</b> <b>policy</b> standards among professional sports leagues that are consistent with, and as stringent as, those enforced by the USADA. While most of the bills were voted out of committee, none were enacted. As of 2013, professional sports leagues continue to negotiate their anti-doping policies privately through collective bargaining.|$|R
