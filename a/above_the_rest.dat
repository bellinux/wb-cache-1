The esplanade is raised <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the courtyard; the vaulted area beneath it would have provided storage and could have acted as stabling and shelter from missiles. Lining the west of the courtyard is the hall of the Knights. Though probably first built in the 12thcentury, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.|$|E

In the catalytic cycle, the first reaction {{which leads to}} the formation of Compound I occurs between H 2 O 2 and <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> Fe(III) state of the heme group. Compound I is a high oxidation state intermediate containing an oxoferryl (Fe IV) centre which is two oxidising equivalents <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> state. <b>The</b> substrate of the enzyme provides an electron (the first of two single electron transfers) that reduces Compound I to form Compound II. Compound II is also an oxoferryl compound which is one oxidising equivalent <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> state. Both Compound I and Compound II have redox potentials of approximately + 1  V (Veitch 2004).|$|R

5|$|This board {{terminated}} Hefty {{and hired}} the architectural firm of Whidden and Lewis {{to design a}} new building. Ion Lewis and William Whidden were originally from Boston, but were in Portland for the Portland Hotel project, and Whidden had been employed with McKim, Mead, and White. The board also persuaded the state legislature to authorize an additional $500,000 in bonds to complete the project. Whidden & Lewis designed a four-story structure in a neo-Renaissance style that included a clock tower.

Due to costs, the clock tower was never built. A domed cupola also designed by Whidden and Lewis was never built. The original building design was praised for the details and symmetry.|$|E

For example, at Jōruri-ji in Kyōto (1107) part of the Hon-dō's ceiling was raised <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> to give space to the room.

25|$|As {{with almost}} all {{carnivorous}} plants, the flowers of butterworts are held far <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> {{of the plant}} by a long stalk, {{in order to reduce}} the probability of trapping potential pollinators. The single, long-lasting flowers are zygomorphic, with two lower lip petals characteristic of the bladderwort family, and a spur extending from the back of the flower. The calyx has five sepals, and the petals are arranged in a two-part lower lip and a three-part upper lip. Most butterwort flowers are blue, violet or white, often suffused with a yellow, greenish or reddish tint. P. laueana and the newly described P. caryophyllacea are unique in having a strikingly red flowers. Butterworts are often cultivated and hybridized primarily for their flowers.|$|E
25|$|Blake's great {{innovation}} in relief etching was to print from the relief, or raised, {{parts of the}} plate rather than the intaglio, or incised, parts. Whereas intaglio methods worked by creating furrows into which the acid was poured to create 'holes' in the plate and the ink then poured over the entire surface, Blake wrote and drew directly onto the plate with an acid-resistant material known as a stop-out. He would then embed the plate’s edges in strips of wax to create a self-contained tray and pour the acid {{about a quarter of}} an inch deep, thus causing the exposed parts of the plate to melt away, and the design and/or text to remain slightly <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the plate, i.e. in relief, like a modern rubber stamp. The acid was then poured off, the wax was removed, and the raised part of the plate covered with ink before finally being pressed onto the paper in the printing press. This method allowed expressive effects which were impossible to achieve via intaglio. The major disadvantage was that text had to be written backwards as whatever was on the plate would print in reverse when pressed onto the paper. The dominant theory as to how Blake solved this problem is simply that he wrote in reverse. Another theory, suggested by David Bindman, is that Blake wrote his (acid resistant) text on a sheet of paper the correct way around, and then pressed the paper onto the plate, thus reversing the text and producing the same result as if had he written it backwards in the first place.|$|E
