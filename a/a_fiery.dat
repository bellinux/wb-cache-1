5|$|Later that year, William Fitz Osbern gave <b>a</b> <b>fiery</b> speech {{against the}} oppression of the poor at Paul's Cross and incited a riot which saw the cathedral invaded, halted only by an appeal for calm by Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury. Osbern barricaded himself in nearby St Mary-le-Bow and was later executed, after which Paul's Cross was silent for many years.|$|E
5|$|Irenaeus' eschatology {{was based}} on a literal {{interpretation}} of the Bible, especially the Book of Revelation. He believed that there would be 6000 years of suffering before the world ends in <b>a</b> <b>fiery</b> purge. This fire would purify believers ahead of a new human community existing in the New Jerusalem. The afterlife, Irenaeus proposed, focuses more on time than space; he looked forward to a time in which humans are fully developed and live the life of God.|$|E

Coverage in the film magazine Djaja described him as hardworking and highly dedicated to his craft, to the point of forsaking romantic relationships.|$|E
5|$|At the Dutch Grand Prix, Rindt {{eventually}} {{used the}} new Lotus 72, better sorted after alterations had been made.

Rindt went on to take his maiden victory in the Lotus 72, {{but it was not a}} joyful occasion for him; on lap 23, his close friend Piers Courage, with whom he had eaten dinner just the night before, died in <b>a</b> <b>fiery</b> crash. Rindt was heavily shaken by the loss of yet another fellow driver and contemplated retirement.|$|E
5|$|Because The Assayer {{contains}} such {{a wealth}} of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it {{has been referred to}} as his scientific manifesto. Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618, which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was <b>a</b> <b>fiery</b> body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon, it must be farther away than the moon.|$|E

It may fluff its red back and shoulder feathers out so they cover {{part of the}} wings in a puffball-display. It will fly about and confront another male to repel it, or to assert dominance over a female. It also picks red petals and sometimes red seeds and presents them to other birds. 90% of the time, the male presents to a female in {{what appears to be}} a courtship ritual. The other 10% of the time, it presents to another male in an act of apparent aggression.|$|E
5|$|In the Anushasana Parva of the Mahabharata, the god Shiva is {{described}} as having cast a curse on Surabhi. This curse is interpreted as {{a reference to the}} following legend: Once, when the gods Brahma and Vishnu were fighting over who was superior, <b>a</b> <b>fiery</b> pillar—linga (symbol of Shiva)—emerged before them. It was that decided whoever found the end of this pillar was superior. Brahma flew to the skies to try to find the top of the pillar, but failed. So Brahma forced Surabhi (in some versions, Surabhi instead suggested that Brahma should lie) to falsely testify to Vishnu that Brahma had seen the top of the linga; Shiva punished Surabhi by putting a curse on her so that her bovine offspring would have to eat unholy substances. This tale appears in the Skanda Purana.|$|E
5|$|In the {{newspaper}} articles, Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell were each able to publish their own {{side of the}} story, filing their own charges against Cope. Ballou's articles were poorly researched, written, and read, and Cope himself was smarting from a piece in The Philadelphia Inquirer which suggested the University of Pennsylvania trustees would ask Cope to step down unless he provided proof for his charges against Marsh and Powell. Marsh himself kept the Herald story alive with <b>a</b> <b>fiery</b> rebuttal, {{but by the end}} of January the story had faded from all {{the newspaper}}s, and little changed between the bitter rivals.|$|E

5|$|The Aegean Sea setting {{includes}} {{a mass of}} shipwrecked vessels. Athens is a war-torn city under assault by Ares, the God of War; beyond the city is the Desert of Lost Souls, a vast and windy desert of ancient ruins. The majority of the game occurs in Pandora’s Temple, which is chained {{to the back of}} the Titan Cronos, who crawls through the desert. The massive temple, constructed by the architect Pathos Verdes III, is filled with traps and monsters, and has three sections dedicated to the Titan Atlas and gods Poseidon and Hades, respectively. The Underworld is <b>a</b> <b>fiery</b> realm with spiked pillars full of souls and flaming versions of previously encountered enemies. Athens is the scene of the final battle before a denouement on Mount Olympus in the God of War's throne room.|$|E
5|$|While searching a motel for supplies, L.J. is {{bitten by}} a zombie, which he keeps secret. The next morning the convoy is {{attacked}} by crows that had been feeding on the infected. The crows almost overwhelm the convoy, killing Nurse Betty and Otto and taking out the flamethrower operator, causing the weapon to careen out of control. Alice finally appears and saves Carlos and the others from <b>a</b> <b>fiery</b> death, using her telekinesis to fill the sky with fire, killing the crows and leaving her unconscious. After recovering, Alice is introduced to Claire and gives her the diary she found, and she and Carlos then convince Claire to take her convoy to Alaska.|$|E

When she learns the truth about the shagreen and her role in Raphaël's demise, she is horrified. Raphaël cannot control his desire for her and she rushes into an adjoining room to escape him and so save his life. He pounds on the door and declares both his love and his desire to die in her arms.

5|$|After a long chase, the Flying Monkeys {{succeed in}} {{capturing}} their targets {{and bring them}} back to Evillene. Vengeful for Dorothy having killed her sister, she dismembers the Scarecrow, flattens the Tin Man, and tortures the Lion in hopes of making Dorothy give her the silver shoes. When she threatens to throw Toto into <b>a</b> <b>fiery</b> cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives in until the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch, which she does. The sprinklers put out the fire but also melt Evillene. She is flushed down into her throne, the lid of which slams shut like a toilet. With Evillene finally gone, her spells lose their power: the Winkies are freed from their permanent costumes (revealing attractive humans underneath) and their sweatshop tools disappear. They rejoice in dance and praise Dorothy as their emancipator. The Flying Monkeys give her and her friends a triumphant ride back to the Emerald City.|$|E
5|$|Between 1892 and 1895 the Agapemonites {{built the}} Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Clapton, London. It was {{designed}} by Joseph Morris in a Gothic style. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, {{the outside of the}} church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth {{from the base of the}} steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, <b>a</b> <b>fiery</b> chariot and a sheaf of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J. S. Sparrow, betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'. The church was abandoned after 1956 and now is used by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E
5|$|Legends {{describing}} Cofresí as malevolent generally link him to supernatural elements {{acquired through}} witchcraft, mysticism or {{a deal with}} the Devil. This horror fiction emphasizes his ruthlessness while alive or his unwillingness to remain dead. Cofresí's ghost has <b>a</b> <b>fiery</b> aura or extraordinary powers of manifestation, defending the locations of his hidden treasure or roaming aimlessly. Cofresí has been vilified by merchants. Legends portraying him as benign figure are more prevalent near Cabo Rojo; in other areas of Puerto Rico, they focus on his treasure and depict him as a cutthroat. Most of the hidden-treasure stories have a moral counseling against greed; those trying to find the plunder are killed, dragged to Davy Jones' Locker or attacked by the ghost of Cofresí or a member of his crew. Rumors about the locations of hidden treasure flourish, with dozens of coves, beaches and buildings linked to pirates in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola.|$|E
