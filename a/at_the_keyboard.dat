5|$|Wolfgang was {{qualified}} by {{his skills}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>keyboard</b> and violin, {{and by his}} compositional experience, for a post as Kapellmeister; but at 17 he was too young. He therefore remained in Colloredo's employ at the Salzburg court, increasingly discontent, until his dismissal from the Archbishop's retinue during its stay in Vienna, in 1781. Leopold, unpromoted from his rank of vice-Kapellmeister, remained with the court {{until his death in}} 1787.|$|E
5|$|Geyer's love of {{the theatre}} came to be shared by his stepson, and Wagner took part in his performances. In his {{autobiography}} Mein Leben Wagner recalled once playing the part of an angel. In late 1820, Wagner was enrolled at Pastor Wetzel's school at Possendorf, near Dresden, where he received some piano instruction from his Latin teacher. He struggled to play a proper scale <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>keyboard</b> and preferred playing theatre overtures by ear. Following Geyer's death in 1821, Richard {{was sent to the}} Kreuzschule, the boarding school of the Dresdner Kreuzchor, at the expense of Geyer's brother. At the age of nine he was hugely impressed by the Gothic elements of Carl Maria von Weber's opera Der Freischütz, which he saw Weber conduct. At this period Wagner entertained ambitions as a playwright. His first creative effort, listed in the Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis (the standard listing of Wagner's works) as WWV 1, was a tragedy called Leubald. Begun when he was in school in 1826, the play was strongly influenced by Shakespeare and Goethe. Wagner was determined to set it to music, and persuaded his family to allow him music lessons.|$|E
25|$|As a young child, Gould {{was taught}} piano by his mother. At {{the age of}} 10, he began {{attending}} The Royal Conservatory of Music (known until 1947, when it received a Royal Charter from King George VI, as the Toronto Conservatory of Music) in Toronto. He studied music theory with Leo Smith, the organ with Frederick C. Silvester, and piano with Alberto Guerrero. Around the same time, he injured his back {{as a result of}} a fall from a boat ramp on the shore of Lake Simcoe. This incident is almost certainly related to the adjustable-height chair his father made shortly thereafter. Gould's mother would urge the young Gould to sit up straight <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>keyboard.</b> He used this chair for the rest of his life and took it with him almost everywhere. The famous chair was designed so that Gould could sit very low <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>keyboard.</b> The chair allowed him to pull down on the keys rather than striking them from above, a central technical idea of his teacher at the Conservatory, Alberto Guerrero.|$|E

25|$|Serry {{was born}} Giovanni Serrapica in Brooklyn, New York to Italian-American parents Pasquale Serrapica and Anna Balestrieri of Castellammare di Stabia, Italy. He {{was the fourth}} sibling {{in a family of}} {{thirteen}} children. His first exposure to classical music occurred through the influence of his father who entertained his children with performances on the mandolin and the piano.

25|$|The {{use of any}} {{keyboard}} {{may cause}} serious injury (that is, carpal tunnel syndrome or other repetitive strain injury) to hands, wrists, arms, neck or back. The risks of injuries can be reduced by taking frequent short breaks {{to get up and}} walk around a couple of times every hour. As well, users should vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When inputting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>keyboard,</b> a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and mouse positioned so that reaching is not necessary. The chair height and keyboard tray should be adjusted so that the wrists are straight, and the wrists should not be rested on sharp table edges. Wrist or palm rests should not be used while typing.|$|E

By February 1956 she was touring with her own new show, an exotic calypso act which played <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Keyboard</b> in Beverly Hills, where she was [...] "wooed by disk executives", according to Billboard. She headlined at the Village Vanguard in March, gigged for four weeks at the Clouds in Honolulu in July–August, and joined the Lester Horton dancers for a Halloween show at the Palladium. Angelou signed with Liberty Records in September. By November 1956, Variety was describing the process of recording her first album, Miss Calypso, and even speculating that her second album might be a collection of Noël Coward songs, based on her playful ad-libbing of a Coward tune between takes at the recording studio.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Nobody Sees" [...] {{features}} the entire line-up of Powderfinger in {{shot in the}} dark at nighttime with the Melbourne cityscape in the background. The group's lead vocalist, Bernard Fanning, who in all previous recordings would play keyboards and piano parts, did not record any of these parts for Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, as these duties were fulfilled by Benmont Tench. Though Tench performed the keyboard in the recording of the song, Fanning appears <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>keyboard</b> in the music video. The scenes of the band playing are intercut with video shots of a do-it-yourself carwash, and five shots of people by themselves. These people are all initially shown being still then as the video progresses, the people are shown performing highly energetic actions in slow motion. The actions shown include running, falling and jumping. There are instances through Ian Haug's guitar solo where John Collins' bass guitar and Darren Middleton's electric guitar are also shown in close-up and slow motion.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, while {{continuing}} his violin studies, Monteux took up the viola. He studied privately with Benjamin Godard, with whom he performed in the premiere of Saint-Saëns's Septet, with the composer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>keyboard.</b> Monteux joined the Geloso Quartet as violist; he played many concerts with them, including a performance of Fauré's Second Piano Quartet with the composer at the piano. On another occasion he was the violist in a private performance of a Brahms quartet given before the composer in Vienna. Monteux recalled Brahms's remark, [...] "It takes the French to play my music properly. The Germans all play it much too heavily." [...] Monteux remained {{a member of the}} Geloso Quartet until 1911. With Johannes Wolff and Joseph Hollman he also played chamber music for Grieg. Years later, in his seventies, Monteux deputised with the Budapest Quartet without rehearsal or score; asked by Erik Smith if he could write out the parts of the seventeen Beethoven quartets, he replied, [...] "You know, I cannot forget them." ...|$|E

[...] Describing his piano technique as [...] "staccato style," [...] Jorgensen finds that on [...] "Without Love" [...] from the 1969 sessions, [...] "his gospel-flavored treatment took it to a level of spirituality rarely matched in his career." [...] Presley also played the instrument on the [...] "impassioned version" [...] of the sessions' next song, [...] "I'll Hold You in My Heart," [...] of which Guralnick writes that [...] "there is something magical about the moment that only the most inspired singing can bring about, as Elvis loses himself in the music, words no longer lend themselves to literal translation, and singer and listener both are left emotionally wrung out by the time the song finally limps to an end." ...|$|E
500|$|Brigitte François-Sappey {{points out}} the {{frequency}} with which Alkan has been compared to Berlioz, both by his contemporaries and later. She mentions that Hans von Bülow called him [...] "the Berlioz of the piano", while Schumann, in criticising the Op. 15 Romances, claimed that Alkan merely [...] "imitated Berlioz on the piano." [...] She further notes that Ferruccio Busoni repeated the comparison with Berlioz in a draft (but unpublished) monograph, while Kaikhosru Sorabji commented that Alkan's Op. 61 Sonatine was like [...] "a Beethoven sonata written by Berlioz". Berlioz was ten years older than Alkan, but did not attend the Conservatoire until 1826. The two were acquainted, and were perhaps both influenced by the unusual ideas and style of Anton Reicha who taught at the Conservatoire from 1818 to 1836, and by the sonorities of the composers of the period of the French Revolution. They both created individual, indeed, idiosyncratic sound-worlds in their music; there are, however, major differences between them. Alkan, unlike Berlioz, remained closely dedicated to the German musical tradition; his style and composition were heavily determined by his pianism, whereas Berlioz could hardly play <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>keyboard</b> and wrote nothing for piano solo. Alkan's works therefore also include miniatures and (among his early works) salon music, genres which Berlioz avoided.|$|E

500|$|As a leader, Byard {{recorded}} {{a string of}} albums for the Prestige label during the 1960s. Some of these albums included Richard Davis on bass and Alan Dawson on drums, a trio combination described by critic Gary Giddins as [...] "the most commanding rhythm section of the '60s, excepting the Hancock-Carter-Williams trio in Miles Davis's band", although it existed only for recordings. One such album was Jaki Byard with Strings!, a sextet recording that featured Byard's composing and arranging: on [...] "Cat's Cradle Conference Rag", each of five musicians [...] "play five standards based on similar harmonies simultaneously". A further example of Byard's sometimes unusual approach to composition is the title track from Out Front!, which he created by thinking of fellow pianist Herbie Nichols' touch <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>keyboard.</b> Popularity with jazz critics did not translate into wider success: a Washington Post review of his final Prestige album, Solo Piano from 1969, remarked that it was by [...] "a {{man who has been}} largely ignored outside the inner circles". Giddins also commented in the 1970s on the lack of attention that Byard had received, and stated that the pianist's recordings from 1960 to 1972 [...] "are dazzling in scope, and for his ability {{to make the most of}} limited situations". Following his time with Prestige, Byard had more solo performances, in part because of his affection for musical partners he had become close to but who had then died.|$|E
