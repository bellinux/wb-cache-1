5|$|For Shaw's Ferrari, it {{was decided}} that {{purchasing}} an actual model of which only 350 exist and would cost at least $1million would be too expensive and the vehicle would be unsuitable for filming purposes. Instead, two replicas were commissioned, a process which took three months under the supervision of prop master Peter Gelfman. The replicas then received <b>additional</b> <b>reinforcement</b> for filming purposes from Steve Kirshoff and the special effects crew. After running camera tests on several authentic Ferrari colors, {{it was decided}} to paint the replicas bright red {{in order to create a}} lasting impression instead of using the actual metallic brown muted-coloring of McQueen's vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Typical school backpacks {{generally}} {{lack the}} rigid frame of an outdoor-style backpack and include {{only a few}} pockets in the front {{in addition to the}} main storage compartment. While traditionally very simple in design, school backpacks are often made with padded shoulder straps and backs as well as <b>additional</b> <b>reinforcement</b> to hold large numbers of heavy textbooks, as well as safety features such as reflective panels to make the wearer of the pack more visible at night.|$|E
25|$|Elevated roadways are {{typically}} built on sections of elevated earth fill connected with bridge-like segments, often supported with vertical columns. If the soil fails where a bridge terminates, the bridge may become {{disconnected from the}} rest of the roadway and break away. The retrofit for this is to add <b>additional</b> <b>reinforcement</b> to any supporting wall, or to add deep caissons adjacent to the edge at each end and connect them with a supporting beam under the bridge.|$|E

25|$|Groupement Mobile 31 (GM 31) {{arrived from}} Military Region 3 to {{reinforce}} the Royalists on 22 December. By 28 December, MR 2 had received six Lao battalions and 11 replacement howitzers; 25 more of the latter were en route. On 30 December, Groupement Mobile 30 (GM 30) arrived as <b>additional</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> By now, half of the 4,000 guerrillas that had succumbed to the initial PAVN attacks were still unaccounted for. The situation was desperate enough that 111 B52 sorties had struck {{in support of the}} Royalists during December. The PAVN shot down six T-28 Trojans and three Phantoms during the same period.|$|E
2500|$|Pannewitz {{had been}} allowed to {{withdraw}} by Below, which led Falkenhayn to sack Below's Chief of Staff General Grünert and order that [...] "the first principle in position warfare must be to yield not one foot of ground and if it be lost to retake it by immediate counter-attack, even {{to the use of the}} last man". At [...] the French resumed the attack, captured Frise and overran the two battalions of the XVII Corps and a regiment of the 22nd Reserve Division in the second position, Herbécourt falling in thirty minutes. At Assevillers the defence repulsed two French attacks, with artillery support and reinforcements taken from further south. False reports spread great anxiety among the German commanders and for a while the 28th Reserve Division headquarters believed in a non-existent threat to both flanks. German reinforcements were distributed piecemeal, the III Battalion, Infantry Regiment 186 being sent in the evening to relieve Reserve Infantry Regiment 111, near Mametz, where they were killed or captured along with the remnants of Reserve Infantry Regiment 111. At [...] the 26th Reserve Division ordered Reserve Infantry Regiment 110 to withdraw through La Boisselle and Infantry Regiment 180 to defend Ovillers at all costs and Below issued a secret order forbidding voluntary retirements. Infantry Regiment Lehr of the 3rd Guards Division, was sent to reinforce the defence of Ovillers and Pozières. The new position was held by elements of six divisions and attached troops, who were organised into groups, led by the corps commanders, General von Quast on the south bank, General von Gossler on the north bank from the Somme to the Albert–Bapaume road and General Hermann von Stein from the road to Gommecourt; the 183rd Division was sent from the Sixth Army as an <b>additional</b> <b>reinforcement.</b>|$|E

50|$|In India, ferro {{concrete}} is used {{often because}} the constructions made from it are {{more resistant to}} earthquakes. Earthquake resistance is dependent on good construction technique and <b>additional</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of the concrete.|$|E
50|$|The German {{authority}} appointed Lieutenant Tom von Prince {{specifically to}} challenge and crash Isike’s resistance {{by any means}} necessary. This time the Germans were better prepared with the <b>additional</b> <b>reinforcement</b> including the local ruga-ruga deserters who were lured with handsome rewards {{to work for the}} Germans as mercenaries. Lieutenant Tom von Prince Military was equipped with better weapons.|$|E
5000|$|The garage was {{originally}} planned {{to open in}} December 2013, but the opening was delayed several times due to construction difficulties. A retaining wall required <b>additional</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> unusually cold winter temperatures prevented contractors from pouring concrete, and contaminated soil had to be unexpectedly brought to out-of-state disposal locations when in-state facilities closed. The city of Beverly contributed $500,000 in city funds to cover additional construction costs from these delays.|$|E
5000|$|Strike: The attacking team must {{destroy the}} three caches of the {{defending}} team.

60|$|On the day Fort Donelson fell I had 27,000 men {{to confront}} the Confederate lines and guard the road four or five miles to the left, over which all our {{supplies}} had to be drawn on wagons. During the 16th, after the surrender, <b>additional</b> <b>reinforcements</b> arrived.|$|R
5000|$|Since Sep 2006 the Belgian {{federal law}} on [...] "co-parenté" [...] came into effect. It {{introduced}} a presumption of dual location or shared residency which by {{law should be}} taken into serious consideration and thorough investigation with priority in each individual case by the Belgian family courts and judges on the request of either one of the divorcing parents separately. Immediate court-access can also be requested by one parent, when <b>additional</b> <b>reinforcement</b> orders are necessary.|$|E

5000|$|This {{construction}} {{technique is}} one of the most versatile natural building methods and can be used for benches, freestanding walls, emergency shelters, temporary or permanent housing, or barns and commercial buildings. Earthbag is frequently chosen for many small-to-medium-sized institutional structures in the developing world. Subgrade structures including underground and bermed dwellings (such as Earthships), cisterns, spring boxes, root cellars, and retaining walls can be built with stabilized soil fill or with <b>additional</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and water-resistant gravel or sand fill.|$|E
50|$|<b>Additional</b> <b>reinforcement</b> to the Republika Srpska Air Force was ensured {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the 92nd Light Multi-role Aircraft Squadron, which was in fact a mixed collection of light aircraft which were confiscated from sport aeroclubs around Bosnia. It has been confirmed that the 92nd Light Multi role Aircraft Squadron was equipped with An-2, UTVA-66, UTVA-75, Zlin 526F, PZL-104 Wilga 80, Piper PA-18-150 Super Cub and Cessna 172 aircraft that were divided into three flights, based at Zaluzani, Prijedor and Bratunac airfields.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. {{version of}} the second {{generation}} CR-X employed the use of side impact door beams on some models. These models can be identified by the mounting position of the safety belts. If the belt is mounted in the door, the beams are present. If the belt is mounted in the body, there is no <b>additional</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> 88 and 89 HFs along with 88 SIs and DXs have the B-pillar mounted restraints, like all versions sold outside of the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The Yeomanry Mounted Division was {{relieved}} by the 74th (Yeomanry) Division; two brigades of infantry were substituted for four brigades of cavalry {{resulting in a}} sixfold {{increase in the number}} of rifles.

50|$|Bassini {{is remembered}} for his {{operative}} techniques involving inguinal hernia repair. In 1884 he introduced a surgical procedure that allowed for {{reconstruction of the}} inguinal canal and restoration of the patient's anatomy following removal of the hernial sac. It was a landmark operation because the posterior wall of the inguinal canal could be rebuilt and reinforced with only surgical sutures. It required no <b>additional</b> <b>reinforcement</b> or prosthesis. Despite {{the importance of the}} new surgical method, it didn't become known outside of Italy until 1890.|$|E
50|$|Rubber {{expansion}} joints {{are mainly}} manufactured by manual wrapping of rubber sheets and fabric reinforced rubber sheets around a bellows-shaped product mandrel. Besides rubber and fabric, reinforced rubber and/or steel wires or metal rings are added for <b>additional</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> After the entire product is built {{up on the}} mandrel, it {{is covered with a}} winding of (nylon) peel ply to pressurize all layers together.
