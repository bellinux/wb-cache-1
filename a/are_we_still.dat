500|$|In April 1997, {{the band}} convened at Buck's Kauai {{vacation}} home to record demos of material {{intended for the}} next album. The band sought to reinvent its sound and intended to incorporate drum loops and percussion experiments. Just as the sessions were due to begin in October, Berry decided, after months of contemplation and discussions with Downs and Mills, to tell {{the rest of the}} band that he was quitting. Berry told his bandmates that he would not quit if they would break up as a result, so Stipe, Buck, and Mills agreed to carry on as a three-piece with his blessing. Berry publicly announced his departure three weeks later in October 1997. Berry told the press, [...] "I'm just not as enthusiastic as I {{have been in the past}} about doing this anymore [...] [...] [...] I have the best job in the world. But I'm kind of ready to sit back and reflect and maybe not be a pop star anymore." [...] Stipe admitted that the band would be different without a major contributor: [...] "For me, Mike, and Peter, as R.E.M., <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> R.E.M.?

Nothing can be more expressive of a conceited, narrow-minded reviewer. 'Oh he!--he is absolutely everywhere,--What others dance, he must decide upon. If he can't chatter about every step, 'tis as good as not made at all. Nothing provokes him so much as when we go forward.

O, lady, has it ever been your lot to sit out such hour as that with some Mrs. Stistick, who would neither talk, nor read, nor sleep; in whose company you could neither talk, nor read, nor yet sleep? And if such has been your lot, have you not asked {{yourself}} why in this civilized country, in this civilized century, you should be doomed to such a senseless, sleepless purgatory?--But when they were gone, and when the judge, radiant with fun and happiness, hastened to fill his claret beaker, then Bertram by degrees thawed, and began to feel that after all the world was perhaps not yet dead around him.|$|E

60|$|It is very {{currently}} {{suggested that}} the modern man is the heir of all the ages, that he has got the good out of these successive human experiments. I know not what to say in answer to this, except to ask the reader {{to look at the}} modern man, as I have just looked at the modern man--in the looking-glass. Is it really true that you and I are two starry towers built up of all the most towering visions of the past? Have we really fulfilled all the great historic ideals one after the other, from our naked ancestor who was brave enough to kill a mammoth with a stone knife, through the Greek citizen and the Christian saint to our own grandfather or great-grandfather, who may have been sabred by the Manchester Yeomanry or shot in the '48? <b>Are</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> strong enough to spear mammoths, but now tender enough to spare them? Does the cosmos contain any mammoth that we have either speared or spared? When we decline (in a marked manner) to fly the red flag and fire across a barricade like our grandfathers, are we really declining in deference to sociologists--or to soldiers? Have we indeed outstripped the warrior and passed the ascetical saint? I fear we only outstrip the warrior {{in the sense that we}} should probably run away from him. And if we have passed the saint, I fear we have passed him without bowing.|$|E
