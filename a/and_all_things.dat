Although tulip festivals are held around the world in the spring, the most famous of these is the display at Keukenhof. One of the better-known novels on tulips is The Black Tulip by Alexandre Dumas, père in 1850, dealing with a contest to grow a black tulip in late seventeenth-century Haarlem.|$|E

25|$|I have an {{obsession}} with death and sex. Those two things are also the nexus of horror films, which I've been obsessing over lately.

I've just been noticing a resurgence of this idea of monster, of fantasy, but {{in a very real}} way. If you notice in those films, there’s always a juxtaposition of sex with death. That's what makes it so scary. Body and mind are primed for orgasm and instead somebody gets killed. That's the sort of sick, twisted psychological circumstance.|$|E

25|$|Ohio {{is home to}} {{more than}} 440,000 people of Polish descent, their {{presence}} felt most strongly in the Greater Cleveland area, where half of Ohio's Polish population resides. The city of Cleveland, Ohio has a large Polish community, especially in historic Slavic Village, as part of its Warszawa Section. Poles from this part of Cleveland migrated to the suburbs, such as Garfield Heights, Parma and Seven Hills. Parma has even recently been designated a Polish Village commercial district. Farther out, other members of Cleveland's Polish community live in Brecksville, Independence and Broadview Heights. Many of these Poles return to their Polish roots, by attending masses at St. Stanislaus Church, on East 65th Street and Baxter Avenue. Poles in Cleveland celebrate the annual Harvest Festival, which is usually held at the end of August. It features polka music, Polish food <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> Polish. Cleveland's other Polish section is in Tremont, located on Cleveland's west side. The home parishes are St. John Cantius and St. John Kanty. They also host Polish celebratory events in Cleveland.|$|E
25|$|Miss Lucilla Edith Cavell Teatime is a ladylike conwoman whose {{occasional}} lapses into verbal vulgarity {{make her}} all the more endearing. She has a liking for whisky, a game of dominoes <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> tasteful. She first steps off the train in Flaxborough (a town once described as having the fictional solidarity of Arnold Bennett's Five Towns) in the fourth mystery set there, Lonelyheart 4122. She likes the town {{so much that she}} settles there, even though her attempt at swindling through a lonely-hearts bureau nearly makes her the third woman killed by another swindler. She appears in all subsequent Flaxborough novels except Blue Murder. By the eleventh volume, Plaster Sinners, she is the proprietress of the 'House of Yesteryear' in Northgate, Flaxborough, and a regular attender at local auctions. Her old talents and sleight of hand remain much in evidence. On one occasion two glass decanters are rendered extremely cheap when she casually transfers the stoppers to a tray of miscellaneous items, which she then bids for as well. Her final appearance is in Whatever's Been Going On At Mumblesby? where we find her with an assistant called Edgar and offering opinions on the marketability of such religious relics as saints' kneecaps. In the 1977 Murder Most English BBC television series, which offered adaptations of four of Colin Watson's Flaxborough novels, Lucy Teatime was portrayed by Brenda Bruce.|$|E

Like Brodie, Burton was an agnostic who was fascinated by religion <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> sexual. Brodie consulted with the psychoanalyst community and used her own free association to make Burton reveal his subconscious.

500|$|Variety {{film critic}} Justin Chang {{wrote that the}} film's {{narrative}} structure was unable to handle the philosophical dimension of the plot, and that Prometheus was lazily deferring key plot points under the presumption that a sequel would be made.

Ian Nathan of Empire magazine was unimpressed by Rapace—whom he described as an unconvincing lead—and said that with [...] "a lack of suspense, threadbare characters, and a very poor script, the stunning visuals, gloopy madness, and sterling Fassbenderiness can't prevent Prometheus feeling like Aliens poor relation." [...] The Village Voices Nick Pinkerton wrote that the film is [...] "prone to shallow ponderousness", and that Scott [...] "can still mimic the appearance of an epic, noble, important movie—but the appearance is all." [...] He criticized Rapace and Marshall-Green for failing to instill interest in their characters' relationship, but added: [...] "there are a few set pieces here that will find {{a place of honor}} among aficionados of body horror <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>things</b> clammy and viscous".|$|E
