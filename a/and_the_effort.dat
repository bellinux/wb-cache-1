5|$|Netball is {{most popular}} in Commonwealth countries, {{and the most}} popular women's spectator sport in Australia and Tanzania <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to {{increase}} media attention and participation for women's sport often goes to Olympic sports with low participation rates, low rates of interest and few facilities. Even then, historically, coverage of women's team sports in the Olympics has been limited. Instead, according to Jones, the media focus on female athletes in non-team competitions and on team sports played equally by both genders.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} that enzymes could be crystallized eventually allowed their structures {{to be solved}} by x-ray crystallography. This was first done for lysozyme, an enzyme found in tears, saliva and egg whites that digests the coating of some bacteria; the structure was solved by a group led by David Chilton Phillips and published in 1965. This high-resolution structure of lysozyme {{marked the beginning of}} the field of structural biology <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to understand how enzymes work at an atomic level of detail.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{paleontology}} traces {{the history of}} the effort to understand the history of life on Earth by studying the fossil record left behind by living organisms. Since it is concerned with understanding living organisms of the past paleontology can be considered to be a field of biology, but its historical development has been closely tied to geology <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to understand the history of Earth itself.|$|E

5|$|The {{homology}} groups H'i(S'n), with i > n, are all trivial. It therefore {{came as a}} {{great surprise}} historically that the corresponding homotopy groups are not trivial in general.

5|$|As the Osiris myth first {{appears in}} the Pyramid Texts, most of its {{essential}} features must have taken shape sometime before the texts were written down. The distinct segments of the story—Osiris's death and restoration, Horus's childhood, and Horus's conflict with Set—may originally have been independent mythic episodes. If so, they must have begun to coalesce into a single story {{by the time of}} the Pyramid Texts, which loosely connect those segments. In any case, the myth was inspired by a variety of influences. Much of the story is based in religious ideas and the general nature of Egyptian society: the divine nature of kingship, the succession from one king to another, the struggle to maintain maat, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to overcome death. For instance, the lamentations of Isis and Nephthys for their dead brother may represent an early tradition of ritualized mourning.|$|E
5|$|Kilner {{began the}} 1920 season with an innings of 206 not {{out in his}} first match, against Derbyshire, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> {{remained}} the highest score of his career. He batted for four hours, hitting 24 fours and two sixes. He could have been caught when he had scored around fifty, but a local newspaper described the innings as brilliant, his driving and pulling being particularly effective. Kilner appeared in one representative match: at the end-of-season Scarborough Festival, he played for CI Thornton's XI against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side which visited Australia in the winter—at the time, the MCC administered English cricket, and the England team toured under its name. In total, he scored 1,316 runs {{at an average of}} 37.09 with two more centuries, placing him second in the Yorkshire averages. With the ball, he took 27 wickets but his average of 25.33 was relatively high. The county finished fourth in the Championship as Middlesex were crowned winners. Critics believed Kilner should have bowled more frequently, an opinion shared by Wilfred Rhodes, Yorkshire's main slow left-arm spinner. Conscious of his increasing age, the 42-year-old Rhodes wanted support with the bowling workload; he considered Kilner the best option and encouraged him to improve his left-arm spin. Consequently, during the winter, Kilner practised bowling in the yard of the Wombwell hotel where his father was landlord. Around the same time he celebrated the birth of his second son, named Major after Major Booth.|$|E

25|$|In 1900, as the 56th Congress {{considered}} {{proposals for}} apportioning its seats among the 45 states following the 1900 Federal Census, Representative Edgar D.

25|$|In 1937, in {{an attempt}} to expand {{the number of people that}} could be involved, the OBP experimented by {{attempting}} to hold three separate parliaments around the province, instead of the one in Victoria.

25|$|The Battle of Medenine, {{also known}} as Operation Capri , was an Axis spoiling attack at Medenine in Tunisia on 6 March 1943.

The British had been forewarned by Ultra decrypts of German wireless communications and rushed reinforcements from Tripoli and Benghazi before the Axis attack, which was a costly failure.

25|$|In 2006, {{early in}} his term, Kaine pressed the General Assembly to support a {{legislative}} package to ease severe traffic congestion by spending about $1 billion annually for highway construction, repairs to aging roads, mass transit, and other transportation projects. The money would raised through increases in taxes and fees that would have raised an estimated $4 billion in revenue over four years. The Democratic-controlled Senate supported the plan, but the Republican-controlled House was ultimately unwilling to approve the taxes necessary {{to carry out the}} project, however, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> failed even after a special session of the Legislature was called over the transportation-funding stalemate.|$|E
25|$|After a {{referendum}} confirmed {{the preservation of}} the Soviet Union but in a looser form, a group of Soviet hard-liners represented by Vice-President Gennadi Yanayev launched a coup attempting to overthrow Gorbachev in August 1991. Boris Yeltsin, then president of the Russian SFSR, rallied the people and much of the army against the coup <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> collapsed. Although restored to power, Gorbachev's authority had been irreparably undermined. Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party following the coup, and the Supreme Soviet dissolved the Party and banned all Communist activity on Soviet soil. Just a few weeks later, the government granted the Baltic states their independence on 6 September.|$|E
