The Jewish Church understood the Messiah to be a divine person. Philo expressly cautions against any one's supposing the Logos to be a mere personification, or symbol. He says, the Logos is a substantial, self- existent Being. The Gnostics, {{as they were}} afterwards called, were a kind of Arians; and thought the Logos was an after-birth. They placed [Greek: Abyssos] and [Greek: Sigae] (the Abyss and Silence) before him. Therefore it was that St. John said, with emphasis, [Greek: en <b>archae</b> aen ho Logos]-- [...] "In the beginning was the Word." [...] He was begotten in the first simultaneous burst of Godhead, if such an expression may be pardoned, in speaking of eternal existence.|$|E
60|$|Christendom, {{from its}} first {{settlement}} on feudal rights, {{has been so}} far one great body, however imperfectly organized, that a similar spirit will be found in each period to have been acting in all its members. The study of Shakespeare's poems--(I do not include his dramatic works, eminently as they too deserve that title)--led me to a more careful examination of the contemporary poets both in England and in other countries. But my attention was especially fixed on those of Italy, from the birth {{to the death of}} Shakespeare; that being the country in which the fine arts had been most sedulously, and hitherto most successfully cultivated. Abstracted from the degrees and peculiarities of individual genius, the properties common to the good writers of each period seem to establish one striking point of difference between the poetry of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and that of the present age. The remark may perhaps be extended to the sister art of painting. At least the latter will serve to illustrate the former. In the present age the poet--(I would wish to be understood as speaking generally, and without allusion to individual names)--seems to propose to himself as his main object, and as that which is the most characteristic of his art, new and striking images; with incidents that interest the affections or excite the curiosity. Both his characters and his descriptions he renders, as much as possible, specific and individual, even to a degree of portraiture. In his diction and metre, on the other hand, he is comparatively careless. The measure is either constructed on no previous system, and acknowledges no justifying principle but that of the writer's convenience; or else some mechanical movement is adopted, of which one couplet or stanza is so far an adequate specimen, as that the occasional differences appear evidently to arise from accident, or the qualities of the language itself, not from meditation and an intelligent purpose. And the language from Pope's translation of Homer, to Darwin's Temple of Nature [62], may, notwithstanding some illustrious exceptions, be too faithfully characterized, as claiming to be poetical for no better reason, than that it would be intolerable in conversation or in prose. Though alas! even our prose writings, nay even the style of our more set discourses, strive to be in the fashion, and trick themselves out in the soiled and over-worn finery of the meretricious muse. It is true that of late a great improvement in this respect is observable in our most popular writers. But it is equally true, that this recurrence to plain sense and genuine mother English is far from being general; and that the composition of our novels, magazines, public harangues, and the like is commonly as trivial in thought, and yet enigmatic in expression, as if Echo and Sphinx had laid their heads together to construct it. Nay, even of those who have most rescued themselves from this contagion, I should plead inwardly guilty to the charge of duplicity or cowardice, if I withheld my conviction, that few have guarded the purity of their native tongue with that jealous care, which the sublime Dante in his tract De la volgare Eloquenza, declares to be the first duty of a poet. For language is the armoury of the human mind; and at once contains the trophies of its past, and the weapons of its future conquests. Animadverte, says Hobbes, quam sit ab improprietate verborum pronum hominihus prolabi in errores circa ipsas res! Sat [vero], says Sennertus, in hac vitae brevitate et naturae obscuritate, rerum est, quibus cognoscendis tempus impendatur, ut [confusis et multivotis] sermonibus intelligendis illud consumere opus non sit.

The <b>archae</b> were intended to safeguard the royal rights in case of future disorder. All Jewish possessions and credits were to be registered and certain cities were designated to serve as the centres for all future Jewish business operations and the registration of Jewish financial transactions, each such city having an archa. In each centre, a bureau was set up consisting of two reputable Jews and two Christian clerks, under the supervision of a representative of the newly established central authority that became known as the Exchequer of the Jews.|$|E

The chests themselves, or more frequently the lists held by the royal clerks of the debts contained in them, were sent up for [...] "scrutiny" [...] to Westminster, where the justices would report to the king as to the capability of the Jewry to bear further tallage. In {{the middle of the}} thirteenth century the number of such <b>archae</b> was reduced to twenty-five.

50|$|Corals {{have been}} found to form {{characteristic}} associations with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Corals have evolved in oligotrophic waters which are typically poor in nitrogen. Corals must therefore form a mutualistic relationship with nitrogen fixing organism, in this case the subject of this study, namely Symbiodinium. In addition to this dinoflagellate, coral also form relationships with bacteria, <b>archae</b> and fungi. The problem is that these dinoflagellates are also nitrogen limited and must form a symbiotic relationship with another organism; here it is suggested to be diazotrophs. In addition, cyanobacteria {{have been found}} to possess genes that enable them to undergo nitrogen fixation. This particular study goes further to investigate the possibility that in addition to the named dinoflagellate and certain cyanobacteria, endosymbiotic algae and the coral contain enzymes enabling them to both undergo ammonium assimilation.|$|E
50|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Barons' war violent measures were adopted to remove all traces of indebtedness either to the king or to the higher barons. The Jewries of London, Canterbury, Northampton, Winchester, Cambridge, Worcester, and Lincoln were looted (1263-65), and the <b>archæ</b> (official chests of records) either destroyed or deposited at the headquarters of the barons at Ely. Simon de Montfort, who in 1231 had expelled the Jews from his town of Leicester, when {{at the height of his}} power after the battle of Lewes annulled all indebtedness to the Jews. He had been accused of sharing the plunder but issued edicts for their protection after the battle. Both the Jewry and the king as its representative must have suffered incalculably by this general wiping out of indebtedness.|$|E
30|$|<b>Archae</b> {{constitute}} the oldest organisms on our earth. Given the harsher conditions prevalent in those days, <b>archae</b> are prominent examples of extremophiles. The specialised {{functions of the}} enzymes (part of the evolved metabolism) in more complex organism have evolved from {{the small number of}} enzymes which these ancestors had. So, these organisms constitute valuable systems to track extensive promiscuity shown by the early enzymes. Jia et al. have detailed both promiscuity as well as moonlighting shown by <b>archae</b> enzymes [82]. <b>Archae</b> enzymes are rich in intrinsic disorder. Jia et al. [82] point out that capacity for the structure to survive under harsh conditions and multitasking (which is seen as promiscuity and moonlighting) required conformational pliability. It is interesting that many “hub proteins” important in metabolic regulations in many organisms {{have been found to be}} intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) [83]. So, promiscuity is one facet of the evolutionary design of enzymes. As Skolnick et al. [84] state, promiscuous behaviour is the biochemical noise (low level, ligand-protein interactions) which was nearly impossible to eliminate as enzyme molecules evolved to assume specialised catalytic roles.|$|E
