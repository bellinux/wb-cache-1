5|$|On 8 November 1923 Hitler and the SA stormed {{a public}} meeting of 3,000 people {{organised}} by Kahr in the Bürgerbräukeller, a beer hall in Munich. Interrupting Kahr's speech, {{he announced that}} the national revolution had begun and declared {{the formation of a}} new government with Ludendorff. Retiring to <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>room,</b> Hitler, with handgun drawn, demanded and got the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow. Hitler's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support. Neither the army, nor the state police, joined forces with Hitler. The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them. Sixteen NSDAP members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.|$|E
5|$|The match {{took place}} in Reykjavík from July to September 1972 {{and was the first}} to receive an American {{broadcast}} in prime time. Fischer lost the first two games in strange fashion: the first when he played a risky pawn-grab in a drawn endgame, the second by forfeit when he refused to play the game in a dispute over playing conditions. Fischer would likely have forfeited the entire match, but Spassky, not wanting to win by default, yielded to Fischer's demands to move the next game to <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>room,</b> away from the cameras whose presence had upset Fischer. After that game, the match was moved back to the stage and proceeded without further serious incident. Fischer won seven of the next 19 games, losing only one and drawing eleven, to win the match 12½–8½ and become the 11th World Chess Champion.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween day, {{she goes}} to the party store, but it is closed. However, the store manager appears and allows her into the shop. She dismisses the masks she sees on display as not good enough for scaring anyone. But she sneaks into <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> and discovers a row of hideously {{deformed}} masks. She is startled to find that the masks feel warm and like human skin, not rubber or plastic. The store owner reluctantly sells her one of the masks and Carly Beth goes home in delight. Later that day, after she takes the mold of her head that her mother made, she puts on the mask and goes in search of Chuck and Steve, determined to get revenge on them. She starts acting more and more aggressively as the night goes on: she chokes Sabrina, throws apples at a house, and frightens children she doesn't know. When she manages to scare Chuck and Steve, she loses the head her mother made, but no longer cares.|$|E

He soon abandoned this venture to begin selling wine at a new location in Leicester Square.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, Stravinsky {{composed}} Funeral Song (Погребальная песня), Op. 5 {{to commemorate}} the death of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.

60|$|Aaron {{was told}} he could have <b>a</b> little <b>back</b> <b>room</b> and pension terms for fifteen lire a day, if he stayed at least fifteen days. The {{exchange}} was then at forty-five.

25|$|At 2.30 pm, {{the police}} {{set fire to}} the {{building}} {{to try to make the}} rest of the Kelly Gang leave the building. Father Gibney ignored the police and went into the burning building. He found Dan Kelly and Steve Hart dead in <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> of the hotel. He said their bodies were lying side by side, their heads resting on blankets. Byrne's body was dragged out of the hotel, but the bodies of Hart and Kelly were badly burned during the fire. People who saw the burned and blackened bodies were only able to tell which was Dan Kelly and which was Steve Hart by their size. They were placed on sheets of bark from a tree and photographed. Three Glenrowan people held hostage inside the hotel died during the siege.|$|E
25|$|Distributions to {{qualified}} {{persons were}} monthly. However, a certain {{proportion of the}} population lived in the streets or were too ill or infirm to pick up their monthly food supply. To them Gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons, mainly monks, every morning with prepared food. It is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed. When he did dine he shared the family table, which he had saved (and which still exists), with 12 indigent guests. To the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity. Hearing of the death of an indigent in <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> he was depressed for days, entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer.|$|E
25|$|The View {{initially}} {{formed around}} a cover band at school, playing their own versions of bands such as Squeeze and the Sex Pistols. Lead singer Kyle Falconer, guitarist Peter Reilly, bassist Kieren Webster and original drummer Michael Annable all attended St John's RC High School, They began by performing {{a number of}} their own songs and cover versions at school talent contests. The deputy head teacher of St John's stated that he knew the band would go far and he told them {{to push for a}} record deal. The View entered the school talent contest four times but were only successful twice. Following this, the band set up base to write their own material in <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> of The Bayview Pub, a bar owned by Falconer's cousin. They progressed to play more cover gigs and weddings around the Dundee area, including the Centenary Bar in Central Dundee and a caravan park in Arbroath. The band were later ejected from their base in The Bayview, following singer Kyle Falconer reportedly riding a scooter along the bar.|$|E
60|$|Thomson {{followed}} his guide into <b>a</b> small <b>back</b> <b>room.</b> An officer was seated before a desk, writing, another was shouting down a telephone, {{and a third}} was making some measurements upon a large Ordnance map nailed upon one of the walls.

60|$|It was a trying {{moment when}} about noon {{he lifted the}} knocker to Grosvenor Square. The door was not opened rapidly, and the delay made him more nervous.

25|$|Noah tracks Sylar and Elle {{down at the}} Canfield {{household}} and watches them have sex through the scope of a sniper rifle. Afterwards, he opens fire, misses, and then breaks {{into the house and}} shoots at them with a Company handgun, hitting Elle in the left thigh and forcing them into a retreat. While looking for them, Noah receives a call from Sandra in which she informs him that Claire is hospitalized. Instead of immediately rushing to the hospital, Noah follows a trail of Elle's blood to a local grocery store. After luring him into <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>room,</b> Sylar jumps him from behind, but he is once again outmatched without his powers against Noah's fighting skills. Ultimately, after tossing the ultimate insult ("Poor Gabriel. You always wanted to be special. Now look at you; you're nobody."), he slits Sylar's throat with a box cutter. When he returns home, Claire is understandably angered with him for focusing on Sylar rather than rushing to the hospital. When Claire reveals that she had died in the hospital, Noah realizes something awful: if Claire's powers are back, then so are Sylar's. Indeed, Sylar and Elle, newly empowered, have made it to the Bennet {{household and}} are holding Sandra and Lyle hostage. Sylar telekinetically disarms Noah, pins him to the wall, and begins to strangle him with his powers. Claire desperately swears to go with Sylar in exchange for leaving her family alone, but Sylar is unsatisfied with that and begins to cut into Noah's neck, clearly intent on decapitating him. Fortunately, Hiro Nakamura arrives, teleports Sylar and Elle away, and then time-travels with Claire back to the day when his father first assigned Noah to protect her.|$|E

50|$|In U.S. {{political}} jargon, a smoke-filled room (sometimes called <b>a</b> smoke-filled <b>back</b> <b>room)</b> is <b>a</b> secret political gathering or {{round table}} style decision-making process.

After being moved to Cachalot, a fireplace and <b>a</b> smaller <b>back</b> <b>room</b> was added. The building underwent major renovations in the mid-1980s.|$|R
500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s {{a group of}} newly observant members began holding more {{traditional}} services in <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> of the synagogue, complete with a mechitza, a partition separating men and women. The [...] "more feminist-minded" [...] members strongly objected to having a mechitza anywhere in the Temple Beth Israel building, {{even if it were}} not in the services they attended. The latter group eventually circulated a petition which stated that either the mechitza would have to be taken down, or those members who wanted it would have to leave. Kinberg also signed the petition. Faced with this opposition, in 1992 the Orthodox members left, renting new premises and hiring their own rabbi, creating Eugene's second synagogue, originally called [...] "The Halachic Minyan", and in 1998 renamed [...] "Congregation Ahavas Torah".|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1735, Johnson opened a private academy at Edial, near Lichfield. The building, Edial Hall, was a large house with a pyramid-shaped roof and a unique design; <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> served as the schoolroom while the rest housed Johnson's family. He had only three pupils, David Garrick, George Garrick and Lawrence Offley; David Garrick—18 at the time—went on {{to become one of}} the most famous actors of his day. Johnson {{designed}} a curriculum that focused on the reading of classical literature, starting with what he considered to be easier works, such as those by Corderius and Erasmus, before slowly progressing to Cornelius Nepos and finally onto Ovid, Vergil, and Horace. The school was advertised in the June and July 1736 editions of The Gentleman's Magazine: [...] "At Edial, near Litchfield, in Staffordshire, Young Gentlemen are Boarded, and Taught the Latin and Greek Languages, by Samuel Johnson".|$|E
500|$|Inspired by the Grandmaster Flash song [...] "The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel", {{he often}} {{attended}} a club called Eve After Dark to watch many DJs and rappers performing live.

At the club, he met aspiring rapper Antoine Carraby, later to become member DJ Yella of N.W.A. Soon afterwards he adopted the moniker Dr.Dre, a mix of previous alias Dr. J and his first name, referring to himself as the [...] "Master of Mixology". Eve After Dark had <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> with a small four-track studio. In this studio, Dre and Yella recorded several demos. In their first recording session, they recorded a song entitled [...] "Surgery", with the lyrics [...] "calling Dr. Dre to surgery" [...] serving as the chorus to the song. He later joined the musical group World Class Wreckin' Cru under the independent Kru-Cut Records in 1984.

[...] "Surgery", which was officially released after being recorded prior to the group's official formation, would prominently feature Dr.Dre on the turntable. The record would become the group's first hit, selling 50,000copies within the Compton area.|$|E
