5|$|Donald Canfield {{detected}} {{records of}} the first significant quantities of atmospheric oxygen just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared– {{and the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation. Oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses; the rise of small, sessile (stationary) organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event, with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of oxygenation. However, the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>composition</b> have attracted some criticism, with widespread anoxia having little effect on life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{radiative}} transfer calculation {{is fundamental to}} all climate modelling. For deep palaeoclimate, and increasingly terrestrial exoplanet climate science, this brings both the joy {{and the challenge of}} exotic <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compositions.</b> The challenge here is that most standard radiation codes for climate modelling have been developed for modern atmospheric conditions and may perform poorly away from these. The palaeoclimate or exoclimate modeller must either rely on these or use bespoke radiation codes, and in both cases rely on either blind faith or ad hoc testing of the code. In this paper, we describe the protocols for the Palaeoclimate and Terrestrial Exoplanet Radiative Transfer Model Intercomparison Project (PALAEOTRIP) to systematically address this. This will compare as many radiation codes used for palaeoclimate or exoplanets as possible, with the aim of identifying the ranges of far-from-modern <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compositions</b> in which the codes perform well.

25|$|Three to four {{billion years}} ago, the Sun emitted only 70% as much power {{as it does}} today. If the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>composition</b> had been the same as today, liquid water should not have existed on Earth. However, there is {{evidence}} {{for the presence of}} water on the early Earth, in the Hadean and Archean eons, leading to {{what is known as the}} faint young Sun paradox. Hypothesized solutions to this paradox include a vastly different atmosphere, with much higher concentrations of greenhouse gases than currently exist. Over the following approximately 4 billion years, the energy output of the Sun increased and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>composition</b> changed. The Great Oxygenation Eventnbsp&– oxygenation of the atmosphere around 2.4 billion years agonbsp&– was the most notable alteration. Over the next five billion years, the Sun's ultimate death as it becomes a red giant and then a white dwarf will have large effects on climate, with the red giant phase possibly ending any life on Earth that survives until that time.|$|E
25|$|He further contributed {{insights}} {{regarding the}} atmospheres of Venus and Jupiter {{as well as}} seasonal changes on Mars. He also perceived global warming as a growing, man-made danger and likened it to the natural development of Venus into a hot, life-hostile planet through a kind of runaway greenhouse effect. Sagan and his Cornell colleague Edwin Ernest Salpeter speculated about life in Jupiter's clouds, given the planet's dense <b>atmospheric</b> <b>composition</b> rich in organic molecules. He studied the observed color variations on Mars' surface and concluded {{that they were not}} seasonal or vegetational changes as most believed but shifts in surface dust caused by windstorms.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in the {{emergence}} of life may have been chemical reactions that produced many of the simpler organic compounds, including nucleobases and amino acids, that are the building blocks of life. An experiment in 1953 by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey showed that such molecules could form in an atmosphere of water, methane, ammonia and hydrogen with the aid of sparks to mimic the effect of lightning. Although <b>atmospheric</b> <b>composition</b> was probably different from that used by Miller and Urey, later experiments with more realistic compositions also managed to synthesize organic molecules. Computer simulations show that extraterrestrial organic molecules could have formed in the protoplanetary disk before the formation of the Earth.|$|E

25|$|Surface albedo {{is defined}} as the ratio of {{irradiance}} reflected to the irradiance received by a surface. The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. These factors vary with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>composition,</b> geographic location and time (see Position of the Sun). While bi-hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly or annual averages.|$|E
25|$|Jupiter's <b>atmospheric</b> <b>composition</b> and ammonia {{clouds were}} recorded, the clouds {{possibly}} created by outflows {{from the lower}} depths of the atmosphere. Io's volcanism and plasma interactions with Jupiter's atmosphere were also recorded. The data Galileo collected supported the theory of a liquid ocean under the icy surface of Europa, and there were indications of similar liquid-saltwater layers under the surfaces of Ganymede and Callisto. Ganymede was shown to possess a magnetic field and the spacecraft found new evidence for exospheres around Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Galileo also discovered that Jupiter's faint ring system consists of dust from impacts on the four small inner moons. The extent and structure of Jupiter's magnetosphere was also mapped.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} ice ages {{are not fully}} {{understood}} for either the large-scale ice age periods or the smaller {{ebb and flow of}} glacial–interglacial periods within an ice age. The consensus is that several factors are important: <b>atmospheric</b> <b>composition,</b> such as the concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane (the specific levels of the previously mentioned gases are now able to be seen with the new ice core samples from EPICA Dome C in Antarctica over the past 800,000 years) changes in the earth's orbit around the Sun known as Milankovitch cycles, the motion of tectonic plates resulting in changes in the relative location and amount of continental and oceanic crust on the earth's surface, which affect wind and ocean currents, variations in solar output, the orbital dynamics of the Earth–Moon system, the impact of relatively large meteorites and volcanism including eruptions of supervolcanoes.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} it was {{suggested}} that a different aurora from the present one had occured on the Earth. The author called it the paleo aurora. The paleo aurora might have occurred on the primitive Earth about 4 billion years ago, when the Earth had an atmosphere dominantly of carbon dioxide. The spectrum of the paleo aurora was expected. Then, it is natural to consider that the spectrum of the paleo aurora and the spectrum of the present aurora should differ from each other because of the difference of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compositions.</b> However, {{there is a possibility that}} the spectrum of the paleo aurora was almost the same as the spectrum of the present aurora although the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compositions</b> was completely different from the present one. In addition to the spectrum, other features about the paleo aurora was expected. Then it can be concluded that the paleo aurora had occurred at higher latitudes on average than it does today and that the paleo aurora was more active than it is today. The paleo aurora is a thing of the past. However the paleo aurora may be observed in the extra-solar systems in the foreseeable future. Content...|$|R

25|$|The first {{close-up}} {{investigation of}} Io using high-resolution imaging {{was performed by}} the twin probes, Voyager1 and Voyager2, launched on September 5 and August 20, 1977, respectively. These two spacecraft were part of NASA and JPL's Voyager program to explore the giant outer planets {{through a series of}} missions in the late 1970s and 1980s. This was a scaled-down version of the earlier Planetary Grand Tour concept. Both probes contained more sophisticated instrumentation than the previous Pioneer missions, including a camera capable of taking much higher resolution images. This was important for viewing the geologic features of Jupiter's Galilean moons as well as the cloud features of Jupiter itself. They also had spectrometers with a combined spectral range from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared, useful for examining Io's surface and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>composition</b> and to search for thermal emission sources on its surface.|$|E
25|$|As a {{standard}} method for analysis, mass spectrometers have reached other planets and moons. Two {{were taken to}} Mars by the Viking program. In early 2005 the Cassini–Huygens mission delivered a specialized GC-MS instrument aboard the Huygens probe through the atmosphere of Titan, the largest moon of the planet Saturn. This instrument analyzed atmospheric samples along its descent trajectory {{and was able to}} vaporize and analyze samples of Titan's frozen, hydrocarbon covered surface once the probe had landed. These measurements compare the abundance of isotope(s) of each particle comparatively to earth's natural abundance. Also on board the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft was an ion and neutral mass spectrometer which had been taking measurements of Titan's <b>atmospheric</b> <b>composition</b> as well as the composition of Enceladus' plumes.

In addition, microorganisms were collected from the stratosphere. Mold samples were carried along {{to determine the effects}} of cosmic ray exposure. Stevens took along a camera to take pictures, including the first ever motion pictures shot from the stratosphere. The collected data showed that the ozone in the upper atmosphere was effective at blocking most of the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. It was also found that the percentage of oxygen at the peak altitude was about the same as that at sea level.|$|E

40|$|Earths and mini Neptunes {{likely have}} {{a wide range of}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compositions,</b> ranging from low {{molecular}} mass atmospheres of H- 2 to higher molecular atmospheres of water, CO 2, N- 2, or other species. Here we systematically investigate the effects of <b>atmospheric</b> bulk <b>compositions</b> on temperature and wind distributions for tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized planets, using an idealized 3 D general circulation model (GCM). The bulk composition effects are characterized in the framework of two independent variables: molecular weight and molar heat capacity. The effect of molecular weight dominates. As the molecular weight increases, the atmosphere tends to have a larger day-night temperature contrast, a smaller eastward phase shift in the thermal phase curve, and a smaller zonal wind speed. The width of the equatorial super-rotating jet also becomes narrower, and the "jet core" region, where the zonal-mean jet speed maximizes, moves to a greater pressure level. The zonal-mean zonal wind is more prone to exhibit a latitudinally alternating pattern in a higher molecular weight atmosphere. We also present analytical theories that quantitatively explain the above trends and shed light on the underlying dynamical mechanisms. Those trends might be used to indirectly determine the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compositions</b> on tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized planets. The effects of the molar heat capacity are generally small. But if the vertical temperature profile is close to adiabatic, molar heat capacity will {{play a significant role in}} controlling the transition from a divergent flow in the upper atmosphere to a jet-dominated flow in the lower atmosphere...|$|R
