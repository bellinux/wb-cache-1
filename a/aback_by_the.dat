5|$|Interpretations vary. The canvas {{seems to}} portray {{simultaneously}} a dreaming {{woman and the}} content of her nightmare. The incubus and horse's head refer to contemporary belief and folklore about nightmares, but have been ascribed more specific meanings by some theorists. Contemporary critics were taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> overt sexuality of the painting, since interpreted by some scholars as anticipating Jungian ideas about the unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Waters Davis stipulated in his sale to Deering {{that the}} Cape Florida {{lighthouse}} be restored. Deering {{wrote to the}} U.S. government seeking specifications and guidelines for the lighthouse. Government officials were taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> request, wondering how a federal lighthouse could have passed into private hands. An Act of Congress and two Executive Orders, in 1847 and 1897, had reserved the island for the federal lighthouse and for military purposes. Patient legal work eventually convinced the U.S. Congress and President Woodrow Wilson to agree to recognize Matheson's and Deering's ownership of Key Biscayne.|$|E
25|$|Apparently taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{critical}} {{reception of}} this novel, {{and the critical}} outcry when {{he was awarded the}} Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962, Steinbeck published no more fiction in the next six years before his death.|$|E
60|$|Never have I seen {{my friend}} more {{completely}} taken <b>aback</b> than <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cabman's reply. For an instant {{he sat in}} silent amazement. Then he burst into a hearty laugh.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} answer--I tell you, sir, I could not answer, so taken <b>aback</b> was I <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{assurance}} of the woman. And so, seeming by my silence {{to agree to}} all that she had said, I was dragged away <b>by</b> <b>the</b> butler and the constable into the cellar, in which they locked me for the night.|$|R
60|$|Stunned {{and terrified}} though poor Mrs Foster was, as she rushed {{about the room}} in search of water and scent-bottles, she was taken <b>aback</b> {{somewhat}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> warmth of these expressions, which Bax, in {{the strength of his}} feelings, and the excitement of the moment, uttered quite unconsciously. Guy was utterly confounded, for the truth {{now for the first time}} flashed upon him, and when he beheld his friend tenderly press his lips on the fair forehead of the still insensible Amy, it became clear beyond a doubt. Lucy was also amazed, for although she was aware of Amy's love for Bax, she had never dreamed that it was returned.|$|R
25|$|The {{attitude}} of Soviet soldiers was ambiguous. Many committed atrocities, most notably rape and murder, {{and did not}} always distinguish between Poles and Germans, mistreating them equally. Other Soviets, were taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> brutal treatment of the German civilians and tried to protect them.|$|E
25|$|Many {{fans of the}} {{original}} Squad Leader game who had looked forward to improvements to the system {{with the release of}} Advanced Squad Leader were taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> need to replace the four modules they had bought; only the mapboards of the earlier series were compatible with the new game.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, CHS {{became the}} first {{alternative}} school in Michigan to receive accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Accreditation officials, according to news reports, were mildly taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> school's eccentricities, questioning {{the lack of any}} non-smoking area within the school and some students' practice of bringing their pets to school.|$|E
5000|$|Heather Phares of Allmusic {{reviewed}} the Scrooged soundtrack album, and stated [...] "The soundtrack to [...] "Scrooged" [...] features updates on Christmas classics {{as well as}} original material by Dan Hartman and Denise Love, Mark Lennon, Robbie Robertson, and Buster Poindexter. The album's sound, {{as well as its}} roster of artists, give it the feel of a time capsule buried in the late '80s, for better or worse. Most of the album brings back bad memories of the cold, brassy sound that dominated the decade's pop. Though [...] "Scrooged" [...] may appeal to fans of the movie, they may be taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> how badly <b>the</b> soundtrack has aged." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the Classic Albums {{documentary}} about the making of A Night at the Opera, Brian May stated that the band was somewhat taken <b>aback</b> at first <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bitterness of Mercury's lyrics, and described by Mercury as being [...] "so vindictive that he May felt bad singing it". After the song came together, {{it was agreed that}} the [...] "author should have his way", and the song was recorded as written.|$|R
50|$|His new {{lifestyle}} impacts {{his life}} both {{for better and}} worse, particularly with {{his relationship with his}} supportive girlfriend, Emily Poule (Jennifer Aniston), when she decides not to continue with him throughout the remainder of the tour as a rock star girlfriend, though Emily and Izzy agree to get back together when the tour reaches Seattle. Eventually, Steel Dragon stops in Seattle for a show, and Emily arrives at his hotel room as they had previously arranged, although Izzy had become so inebriated while on tour he forgot about the arrangement and did not even know what city he was in. Although taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> all <b>the</b> groupies, Emily still tries to reconnect with him, reminding him of their plans to meet up once he got to Seattle, however he is too intoxicated to really understand what she is saying, eventually suggesting they go to Seattle together. Heartbroken with his inconsiderate behavior, intoxication {{and the fact that he}} is sleeping with so many groupies, Emily leaves him.|$|R
25|$|Captain Lee, {{who was in}} {{his private}} cabin {{at the time of}} the incident, {{immediately}} rushed to the bridge. After a short period, all the ship's mates and helmsmen arrived there as well. Around this time, the chief engineer stopped the engines, although it is unknown whether it was on his own volition or following an order from Captain Lee. At 8:50, the chief engineer ordered an evacuation of the engine room through a call to the assistant engineer. During this time, Park was crying, as she was taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sudden incident; this lasted until at least 9:06a.m.|$|E
25|$|Some {{relatives}} of the victims in the case were taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> announcement of a Crown appeal, especially because Attorney-General Wally Oppal had said {{a few days earlier}} that the prosecution would likely not appeal. Although Pickton had been acquitted on the first-degree murder charges, he was convicted of second-degree murder and received the same sentence as he would have on first-degree murder convictions. The {{relatives of}} the victims expressed concern that the convictions would be jeopardized if the Crown argued that the trial judge had made errors. Opposition critic Leonard Krog criticized the Attorney-General for not having briefed the victims’ families in advance.|$|E
25|$|To bring Fanny to her senses, Sir Thomas {{sends her}} for a visit to her parents in Portsmouth, hoping that the {{contrast}} will awaken her {{to the value of}} Henry's offer. She sets off with William and sees him in his first berth as a commissioned officer. At Portsmouth, she develops a firm bond with her younger sister, Susan, but is taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> contrast between her dissolute surroundings — noise, chaos, unpalatable food, crude conversation, and filth everywhere — and the harmonious environment at Mansfield. Henry visits her there. Although Fanny still refuses him, her attitude begins to soften, particularly as Edmund and Mary seem to be moving toward an engagement.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the general}} election, Murphy faced Republican {{incumbent}} Allen West, a freshman congressman {{who ran for}} reelection in the 18th after his former district, the 22nd, had been made significantly more Democratic in redistricting. In the general election, Murphy {{said that he was}} so taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> some of <b>the</b> things West was saying in Congress and on television that he felt compelled to run against him. Allen had called Democrats [...] "Communists", said that Social Security was [...] "akin to slavery", and had fired a pistol near a prisoner's head when serving in the Iraq War. Murphy was supported by Florida's former Republican Governor Charlie Crist and former Democratic President Bill Clinton, along with Republican Sheriff of Martin County Bob Crowder, who ran against West in the primaries. The race was among the most expensive congressional races in 2012, and called one of the ugliest in the 2012 campaign, as well as one of the closest.|$|R

25|$|Doehring, who had {{discounted}} {{the growing}} discontent and longing for peace during the war, was taken completely <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> people's revolutionary riots of 1918. In his {{condemnation of the}} January strikes, Doehring spoke of betrayal {{and may have been}} the first to evoke the stab-in-the-back legend, which held that Germany lost the First World War not for military reasons but due to unpatriotic elements at home. Doehring blamed the subsequent defeat in the war and the following November Revolution and claimed that these events were caused by the decline in Germany's Christian faith and values. For him, most of the blame lay with the Catholic Church and the socialist labor movement. He envisioned a reformation along the lines of Luther's as a solution for Germany.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Steve Jr. {{had heard}} his late father's stories of adventures with Wonder Woman during World War II. It is {{essentially}} confirmed {{in the second}} season première that his father never introduced him to Wonder Woman {{and that he had}} never even seen her photographed. It is similarly implied that he and YN1 Diana Prince were unaware of each other. Diana is taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> younger Steve's existence, implying that his father had never spoken of the boy to either Wonder Woman or YN1 Prince. This was particularly striking when she spoke to Steve Jr. about knowing his father well, from the j-shaped burn scar on his right shoulder, to the 20mm shell casing that he used as a paperweight.|$|E
25|$|Stax {{was located}} in Memphis, Tennessee, which was still a {{segregated}} city, where Martin Luther King, Jr., {{a leader of the}} civil rights movement, was assassinated in 1968. Whilst there was much racism around the artists, the Stax recording studio seemed to be an escape from the turmoil of the real world. When the artists got into the studio, they were there for one reason only, and that was to make hit music, some of which had the social consciousness that became a soundtrack for the civil rights movement. On their 1967 tour in Europe, some of the Stax artists were taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> welcome that they received, enjoying a better reception in parts of Europe than in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, Greig helped Packer {{by signing}} {{a number of}} English and foreign players he was acquainted with. Great secrecy cloaked these signings, {{although}} Greig dropped a number of hints to friends not involved. The touring Australians arrived in England and they were scheduled to play Greig's Sussex team on 7–10 May 1977. The match was ruined by poor weather, but at a party held at Greig's house during the match, two Australian journalists discovered the secret signings and the news became public. Although Greig had counted on a backlash, he was taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> severity of the condemnation and vitriol that poured in his direction. His {{central role in the}} organisation of the breakaway troupe caused much annoyance and surely conflicted with his role as England captain. As the furore continued on, Greig became the focal point for critics, particularly because Packer was still an unknown in Britain. Finally, after a week of politicking, Greig was removed from the England captaincy.|$|E
25|$|The book {{created a}} {{reaction}} in China, sparking follow-up essays by Chinese writers who were taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Phan's description of Vietnamese life under French colonial rule. It generated gloomy pieces by Chinese writers who predicted that their nation would suffer {{a similar fate}} if they failed to modernize. One such Chinese response later became a teaching text at the Tonkin Free School in Hanoi, a school run by Phan's contemporaries to promote the independence movement. However, Phan did not receive much of a reaction in terms of aid towards his independence efforts, since the book made Chinese readers worry about their own future. The book had a much better reception among Vietnamese readers. Phan and a colleague, Đặng Tử Kính, left Japan {{for the first time}} in August 1905, carrying 50 copies of the book that were to distributed throughout Vietnam, of which further copies were made inside the country. Phan's direct writing style, without the use of allegories, upset traditionalists but made the book more accessible to literate people who had not been trained in classical literature.|$|E
25|$|After several weeks, they {{traveled}} to Amritsar, staying near the Harmandir Sahib and worshipping at a Sikh gurudwara. They also read English- and Sanskrit-language books, exposing Tagore to astronomy, biographies of such figures as Benjamin Franklin, and Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Later, in mid-April, Tagore {{and his father}} set off for the remote and frigid Himalayan hill station of Dalhousie, India, near what is now Himachal Pradesh's border with Kashmir. There, at an elevation of some 2,300meters (7,500feet), {{they lived in a}} house high atop Bakrota hill. Tagore was taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> region's deep gorges, alpine forests, and mossy streams and waterfalls. Yet Tagore was also made to study lessons — including such things as Sanskrit declensions — starting in the icy pre-dawn twilight. Tagore took a break from his readings for a noontime meal; thereafter, Tagore was to continue his studies, although he was often allowed to fall asleep. Some two months later, Tagore left his father in Dalhousie and journeyed back to Calcutta.|$|E

25|$|The {{village is}} named after the 6th century Irish Christian missionary Saint Buriana (also {{sometimes}} called Beriana, Buriena, or Beriena). The local legend describes how, whilst ministering to the local inhabitants from the oratory that stood {{on the site of}} the current church, Saint Buriana was abducted by the local king, Geraint (or Gereint) of Dumnonia. Saint Piran, patron saint of Cornwall and also a fellow missionary, negotiated for her release, but the reticent Geraint agreed only on the caveat that he be awoken by a cuckoo calling across the snow, something which would be highly unlikely in mid-winter. The legend states that Saint Piran prayed through the night whilst the snow fell, and in the morning Geraint was awoken by a cuckoo's song. He was so taken <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> miracle that he honoured his pledge, however, shortly afterwards he changed his mind and tried to recapture Buriana. Buriana is said to have died as Geraint tried to re-imprison her, and was purportedly buried on the site of her chapel.|$|E
