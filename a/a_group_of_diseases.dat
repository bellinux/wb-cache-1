5|$|Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> {{that affect}} a dog's {{eyesight}} {{and can lead}} to blindness. It has been documented in a large number of different dog breeds including both the American and English Cocker Spaniels. The two types of Cockers are susceptible to a specific type of PRA called Progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), symptoms include night blindness leading to total blindness between the ages of three and five. PRCD is the most widespread hereditary retinal disease which may lead to blindness in dogs.|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)* is <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> in {{dogs that}} are {{idiopathic}} and {{characterized by the}} presence of inflammatory cell infiltrates in the stomach and/or intestinal walls. It is a common condition. Signs include vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss. Treatment is with dietary modification and use of medications such as corticosteroids, metronidazole, sulfasalazine, and azathioprine.|$|E
25|$|Dermatitis, {{also known}} as eczema is <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> that results in {{inflammation}} of the skin.

25|$|Cancer is <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> {{involving}} abnormal cell {{growth with}} the potential to invade or spread {{to other parts of the}} body. These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss, and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans.|$|E
25|$|Infection occurs {{by eating}} food or drink {{contaminated}} with Ascaris eggs from feces. The eggs hatch in the intestines, burrow through the gut wall, and {{migrate to the}} lungs via the blood. There they break into the alveoli and pass up the trachea, where they are coughed up and swallowed. The larvae then pass through the stomach {{for a second time}} into the intestine, where they become adult worms. It is a type of soil-transmitted helminthiasis and part of <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> called helminthiases.|$|E
25|$|Porphyria is <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> {{in which}} {{substances}} called porphyrins build up, negatively affecting the skin or nervous system. The types {{that affect the}} nervous system are also known as acute porphyria, as symptoms are rapid in onset and last a short time. Symptoms of an attack include abdominal pain, chest pain, vomiting, confusion, constipation, fever, high blood pressure, and high heart rate. The attacks usually last for days to weeks. Complications may include paralysis, low blood sodium levels, and seizures. Attacks may be triggered by alcohol, smoking, hormonal changes, fasting, stress, or certain medications. If the skin is affected, blisters or itching may occur with sunlight exposure.|$|E

It is within the group of cardiovascular diseases {{of which it is}} the most common type. A common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Occasionally it may feel like heartburn. Usually symptoms occur with exercise or emotional stress, last less than a few minutes, and get better with rest. Shortness of breath may also occur and sometimes no symptoms are present. Occasionally, the first sign is a heart attack. Other complications include heart failure or an irregular heartbeat.|$|E
25|$|Findings {{on general}} {{investigations}} (such as blood tests) are not specific for cholesterol embolism, which makes diagnosis difficult. The {{main problem is}} the distinction between cholesterol embolism and vasculitis (inflammation of the small blood vessels), which may cause very similar symptoms - especially the skin findings and the kidney dysfunction. Worsening kidney function after an angiogram may also be attributed to kidney damage by substances used during the procedure (contrast nephropathy). Other causes {{that may lead to}} similar symptoms include ischemic renal failure (kidney dysfunction due to an interrupted blood supply), <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> known as thrombotic microangiopathies and endocarditis (infection of the heart valves with small clumps of infected tissue embolizing through the body).|$|E
25|$|Progressive {{myoclonus}} epilepsy (PME) is <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> {{characterized by}} myoclonus, epileptic seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, and other serious {{symptoms such as}} trouble walking or speaking. These rare disorders often get worse over time and sometimes are fatal. Studies have identified at least three forms of PME. Lafora disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that the disease occurs only when a child inherits two copies of a defective gene, one from each parent. Lafora disease is characterized by myoclonus, epileptic seizures, and dementia (progressive loss of memory and other intellectual functions). A second group of PME diseases belonging to the class of cerebral storage diseases usually involves myoclonus, visual problems, dementia, and dystonia (sustained muscle contractions that cause twisting movements or abnormal postures). Another group of PME disorders {{in the class of}} system degenerations often is accompanied by action myoclonus, seizures, and problems with balance and walking. Many of these PME diseases begin in childhood or adolescence. Treatment is not normally successful for any extended period of time.|$|E
