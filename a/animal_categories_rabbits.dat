40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of using carcass records from the commercial slaughter of reindeer as indicator of long-term changes in animal condition and, thus, the condition and use of their snow-free pasture. The aim was to assess the suitability of this indicator for use within adaptive management programmes for reindeer husbandry grazing resources. Data comprising measurements of carcass weight, conformation and fatness taken from commercial reindeer slaughter between 1994 and 2007, were analysed in relation to year, slaughter date, herding district, population density, and three <b>categories</b> of <b>animals</b> selected for slaughter. The carcass measures were significantly affected by year, and the effects were strongly correlated among the three <b>animal</b> <b>categories.</b> There were generally positive trends over the 14 -year period studied. We identified several factors that should be considered when using carcass data to indicate long-term changes in animal body condition: (i) slaughter date had different effects depending on animal category; (ii) reindeer population density negatively affected female and calf carcasses, but not male carcasses. The effects of herding district were similar for carcasses of calves and females, but differed between females and males. Some of the differences between <b>animal</b> <b>categories</b> may be due to differing timing of slaughter (point i above), by different slaughter selection among districts, or have ecological explanations, e. g. sex differences in range use. Uncertainties in the classification of animals when using skeletal development to discriminate between calf and yearling carcasses, may also add to differences among districts. That population density effects on body condition were detectable together with the similarities in the effects of year and general long-term trends between <b>animal</b> <b>categories</b> support the suggestion that carcass measures can be used to indicate general changes in reindeer body condition and range use...|$|R

Five different <b>animal</b> <b>categories</b> (gilts, sows, piglets, growers and finishers) were sampled at three time points (T 0, T 1 and T 2) before and after transition to a four or five week batch management system. Different matrices of the animals were collected: blood, nasal swabs and faeces. Several economically important diseases were monitored through serology: Lawsonia intracellularis, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSv), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneurnoniae; and PCR-testing: Pasteurella multocida dermonecrotic toxin (DNT) and Brachyspira species, especially the major pathogenic Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. Following serological analysis, the percentage of positive <b>animals</b> per <b>category</b> and sampling occasion were calculated. Health improvement based on serology {{was defined as the}} reduction in the percentage of positive animals for a specific disease in a specified <b>animal</b> <b>category.</b> All samples were negative for P. multocida DNT and B. hyodysenteriae. Little to no improvement could be observed for PRRSv. For L. intracellularis an improvement could be observed in piglets (71 %) and growers (56 %; P < 0. 05). For both of the respiratory pathogens, M. hyopneumoniae and A. pleuropneumoniae, significant improvement was observed in finishers (34 and 24 %, respectively).

In conclusion, the transition from a one week batch management system to a four or five week batch management system in the present herds resulted in a reduction of the percentage of seropositive animals for three of the monitored economically important diseases: L. intracellularis, M. hyopneumoniae and A. pleuropneumoniae...|$|R
40|$|Livestock excreta {{is a large}} {{source of}} {{nitrogen}} (N) in the European Union (EU), used to fertilize crops, and also a main source of ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and nitrate (NO 3 -) losses to the environment. The amount of N in excreta mainly depends on the <b>animal</b> <b>category</b> and productivity, and on feed use and management. National inventories of emissions to the environment are often based on different methodologies for the estimation of N excretion. Here, we present a transparent and uniform methodology for estimating annual feed use and N excretion per <b>animal</b> <b>category</b> for all countries of the EU- 27, based on the energy and protein requirements of the animals and statistics of feed use and composition, animal number and productivity. The calculated total feed use in the EU- 27 was 506 Tg dry mass in 2010. Dairy cows used 29 %, other cattle 34 %, pigs 17 %, chicken 9 %, sheep and goats 8 %, and other <b>animal</b> <b>categories</b> 3 % of the total feed use. Grass and annual forages were mainly used by dairy cows (30 and 49 %, respectively) and other cattle (55 and 44 %); pigs used most of the feed cereals (53 %); protein-rich feed (e. g., soybean meal) were mostly used by pigs (34 %) and chicken (24 %). Differences between countries in feed use were large, mainly related to variations in national feed supply and animal productivity. Total N excretion of the animals amounted to 9. 7 Tg in 2010, and varied between countries from 14 to 291 kgha - 1 of utilized agricultural land. The present study provides a uniform and transparent approach for evaluating feed use and N excretion in all countries of the EU- 27. Our results underline the significant differences in N excretions between EU countries {{as a result of}} feed use variations, suggesting the need for basing N excretion estimations on feed use data.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to predict the beef carcass and LM (thoracis part) {{characteristics}} and the sensory properties of the LM from rearing factors applied during the fattening period. Individual data from 995 animals (688 young bulls and 307 cull cows) in 15 experiments were used to establish prediction models. The data concerned rearing factors (13 variables), carcass characteristics (5 variables), LM characteristics (2 variables), and LM sensory properties (3 variables). In this study, 8 prediction models were established: dressing percentage and the proportions of fat tissue and muscle in the carcass to characterize the beef carcass; cross-sectional area of fibers (mean fiber area) and isocitrate dehydrogenase activity to characterize the LM; and, finally, overall tenderness, juiciness, and flavor intensity scores to characterize the LM sensory properties. A random effect was considered in each model: the breed for the prediction models for the carcass and LM characteristics and the trained taste panel for the prediction of the meat sensory properties. To evaluate the quality of prediction models, 3 criteria were measured: robustness, accuracy, and precision. The model was robust when the root mean square errors of prediction of calibration and validation sub-data sets were near to one another. Except for the mean fiber area model, the obtained predicted models were robust. The prediction models were considered to have a high accuracy when the mean prediction error (MPE) was ≤ 0. 10 and to have a high precision when the was the closest to 1. The prediction of the characteristics of the carcass from the rearing factors had a high precision (> 0. 70) and a high prediction accuracy (MPE 0. 10). Only the flavor intensity of the beef score could be satisfactorily predicted from the rearing factors with high precision (= 0. 72) and accuracy (MPE = 0. 10). All the prediction models displayed different effects of the rearing factors according to <b>animal</b> <b>categories</b> (young bulls or cull cows).
