30|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO), with {{comparable}} bandgap {{energy as}} that of TiO 2 (rutile), has hardly drawn {{as much attention as}} <b>a</b> <b>photocatalyst.</b> The reluctance to use ZnO probably originates from a study of the effect of UV illumination of its aqueous slurry [7]. ZnO dissolves forming Zn 2 +(aq) and simultaneously produces H 2 O 2 in the presence of air. On the other hand, TiO 2 is photochemically stable. However, one of the early studies of ZnO as <b>a</b> <b>photocatalyst</b> shows that it has high reaction and mineralization rates [8] because of its more efficient hydroxyl ion generation efficiency [9]. Subsequent studies discover that ZnO absorbs a large fraction of the solar spectrum and more light quanta than TiO 2 [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. These studies have shown that ZnO acts as <b>a</b> better <b>photocatalyst</b> than TiO 2 under the given conditions. ZnO has been found to satisfactorily degrade an azo dye, brilliant orange [11], and a non-azo dye, Bractive T Blue [12], from aqueous suspensions at the normal pH, approximately 6, of the dyes by visible light with an intensity of approximately 0.18 mW cm− 2. Many more examples of the use of ZnO as <b>a</b> <b>photocatalyst</b> are available in the literatures [15, 16, 17].

Increasing {{levels of the}} release of pharmaceuticals in the environment and formation of the intermediates during their degradation may impose health and environmental risks and therefore require more attention.

The qualitative/quantitative analyses of the intermediates resulted in the determination of the most probable reaction’s mechanism in the degradation process. The mechanism of degradation of acetylsalicylic acid and its reaction pathway were developed from liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS), Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) and UV spectrophotometric analysis. It was found that hydroxyl groups were dominant in the degradation process compared to electrons and holes generated by TiO 2.

Among these, the modification of <b>a</b> <b>photocatalyst</b> with noble metals such as Pt, Au, and Ag is a meaningful and efficient strategy, since these metals can act as electron sinks to effectively transfer the photogenerated electrons, thus improving the corresponding photocatalytic performance [19, 20, 21].
