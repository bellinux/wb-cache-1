5|$|On March 2, 1899, the Army {{received}} an <b>assignation</b> of funds and authorization meant to formally organize troops in Puerto Rico. On March 24, 1899, the General Commander of the Puerto Rico Department, Mayor General Guy V. Henry ordered {{the creation of}} the Porto Rico Battalion of Volunteer Infantry. Formed by four companies named A through D and assigned to San Juan, Mayagüez and Ponce, the unit was activated on May 20, 1899, led by Major Lorenzo Davinson. Shortly afterwards, each company received additional men for a total of 112. Major Ebon Swift replaced Davison as commander. The formalization of this move was notified in General Order 65, issued by the new General Commander Gen. George Davis. On February 12, 1900, the Mounted Battalion was organized and both were later designated Porto Rico Regiment, U.S. Volunteers. The following year, the units were renamed Porto Rico Provisional Regiment of Infantry. The Band and First Battalion were sent to Washington on March 4, 1901, to participate in the inauguration of McKinley.|$|E
5|$|Bertram meets Raimbaut, who {{has arrived}} for an <b>assignation</b> with Alice. He {{gives him a}} bag of gold and advises him not to marry Alice as his new wealth will attract plenty of women (Ah! l’honnête homme). Raimbaut leaves and Bertram gloats at having {{corrupted}} him. Bertram reveals that Robert, to whom he is truly devoted, is his son; he then enters an adjoining cave to commune with the spirits of hell. Alice enters and expresses her love for Raimbaut (Quand je quittai la Normandie). She overhears strange chanting coming from the cave and decides to listen; she learns that Bertram will lose Robert forever if he cannot persuade him to sign away his soul to the Devil by midnight. On emerging from the cave, Bertram realizes that Alice has heard everything (Mais Alice, qu’as-tu donc?). He threatens her and she promises to keep silent. Robert arrives, mourning the loss of Isabelle, and Bertram tells him that to win her he should seize a magic branch from the tomb of Saint Rosalia in a nearby deserted cloister. Although to take it is sacrilege, the branch will give Robert magical powers. Robert declares {{that he will be}} bold and do as Bertram instructs. Bertram leads Robert to the cloister. The ghosts of nuns rise from their tombs, beckoned by Bertram, and dance, praising the pleasures of drinking, gambling and lust. Robert seizes the branch and fends off the demons who surround him.|$|E
40|$|Tax <b>assignations</b> give tax‑paying {{citizens}} {{an opportunity}} to make decisions about a portion of their income tax paid and determine its recipient. Tax <b>assignations</b> are an additional source of income for non‑governmental non‑profit organizations. The Czech Republic has not introduced them yet, however, the other Visegrád Group countries have embodied this concept in their tax systems. The aim of the paper is to confirm or possibly refute the benefits of the concept of tax <b>assignations</b> for the current tax system of the Czech Republic. The influence of the possible introduction of tax <b>assignations</b> is being investigated in connection with the amount of government subsidies and in relation to motivation for philanthropic giving. In this context, the paper presents current conditions for the introduction of tax <b>assignations.</b> It also discusses {{the pros and cons of}} tax <b>assignations</b> that may serve as main arguments for or against the introduction of tax <b>assignations</b> in the Czech Republic. The focus of this paper is on the application of tax <b>assignations</b> in Slovakia as Slovakia with its historical development and structure is very close to the Czech Republic. If tax <b>assignations</b> are introduced in the Czech Republic, a similar development can be expected. Analysis of statistical data for Slovakia was used to explore whether tax <b>assignations</b> affected the amount of transfers to non‑governmental organizations and whether tax <b>assignations</b> could be a good additional source of funding for non‑profit organizations in the Czech Republic...|$|R

25|$|The {{emergence}} of these <b>Assignation</b> rubles was necessary due to large government spending on military needs, {{which led to}} a shortage of silver in the treasury (transactions, especially in foreign trade, were conducted almost exclusively in silver and gold coins). <b>Assignation</b> rubles circulated on equal footing with the silver ruble; a market exchange rate for these two currencies was ongoing.

50|$|Thus, France {{had to pay}} {{on account}} of this convention, 383,251 francs every day for five years; equal to about 16,000 pounds {{sterling}} at the exchange rate of the day. For this daily quota, the French government had to give <b>assignations</b> on the French treasury, payable to bearer, day by day. In the first instance, however, the Coalition Commissioners were to receive {{the whole of the}} 700 million in fifteen bonds of 46⅔ million each; the first of which was payable on 31 March 1816, the second on 21 July 1816, and so on, every fourth month. In the month preceding the commencement of each of these four monthly periods, France was to redeem successively one of these bonds for 46⅔ millions, by exchanging it against the first-mentioned daily <b>assignations</b> payable to bearer, which <b>assignations,</b> for the purpose of convenience and negotiability, were again subdivided into coupures, or sets of smaller sums. As a guarantee for the regular payment of these <b>assignations,</b> and to provide for deficiencies, France assigned, moreover, to the allies, a fund of interest, to be inscribed in the Grand Livre of her public debt, of seven millions francs on a capital of 140 millions. A liquidation was to take place every six months, when the <b>assignations</b> duly discharged by the French Treasury were to be received as payments to their amount, and the deficiency arising from <b>assignations</b> not honoured would be made good, with interest, at five percent from the fund of interest inscribed in the Grand Livre, in a manner specified in this convention.|$|R

25|$|At this point, as {{again in}} the mid-11th century, we come across {{elections}} in which problems of harmonising historical criteria and those of theology and canon law {{make it impossible to}} decide clearly which side possessed the legitimacy whose factual existence guarantees the unbroken lawful succession of the successors of Saint Peter.

25|$|Another {{consideration}} in the configuration of a projection is its compatibility with data sets to be used on the map.

The slight differences in coordinate <b>assignation</b> between different datums is not a concern for world maps or other vast territories, where such differences get shrunk to imperceptibility.|$|E

25|$|It is {{suggested}} that {{about a fifth of}} the Turkish population are Alevis, whose folk music is performed by a type of travelling bard or ozan called aşık, who travels with the saz or baglama, an iconic image of Turkish folk music.

In Turkish aşık literally means 'in love'.

25|$|Astrologically speaking, the Moon is {{associated}} with a person's emotional make-up, unconscious habits, rhythms, memories, moods and their ability to react and adapt to those around them. It is also associated with the mother, maternal instincts or the urge to nurture, the home, the need for security and the past, especially early experiences and childhood. The 1st-century poet Manilius described the Moon, or Luna, as melancholic. In medicine, the Moon {{is associated}} with the digestive system, stomach, breasts, the ovaries and menstruation (which does occur on a monthly cycle) and the pancreas. Despite Manilius's <b>assignation,</b> the Moon is commonly associated with the phlegmatic humor; it ruled the animal spirits.

25|$|Woodwind and harp {{accompany}} a pensive {{version of}} the 'Dmitriy Motif'. The Pretender dreams of an <b>assignation</b> with Marina {{in the garden of}} her father's castle. However, to his annoyance, Rangoni finds him. He brings news that Marina longs for him and wishes to speak with him. The Pretender resolves to throw himself at Marina's feet, begging her to be his wife and Tsaritsa. He entreats Rangoni to lead him to Marina. Rangoni, however, first begs the Pretender to consider him a father, allowing him to follow his every step and thought. Despite his mistrust of Rangoni, the Pretender agrees not to part from him if he will only let him see Marina. Rangoni convinces the Pretender to hide as the Polish nobles emerge from the castle dancing a polonaise (Polonaise). Marina flirts, dancing with an older man. The Poles sing of taking the Muscovite throne, defeating the army of Boris, and capturing him. They return to the castle. The Pretender comes out of hiding, cursing Rangoni. He resolves to abandon wooing Marina and begin his march on Moscow. But then Marina appears and calls to him. He is lovesick. She, however, only wants to know when he will be Tsar, and declares she can only be seduced by a throne and a crown. The Pretender kneels at her feet. She rejects his advances, and, attempting to spur him to action, dismisses him, calling him a lackey. Having reached his limit, he tells her he will depart the next day to lead his army to Moscow and to his father's throne. Furthermore, as Tsar he will take pleasure in watching her come crawling back looking for her own lost throne, and will command everyone to laugh at her. She quickly reverses course, tells him she adores him, and they sing a duet ("O Tsarevich, I implore you"). Rangoni observes the amorous couple from afar, and, joining them in a brief trio, cynically rejoices in his victory.|$|E
