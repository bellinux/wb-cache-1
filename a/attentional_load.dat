Discovery effects involve some change in the bases of response such as in selecting new information relevant for the task, amplifying relevant information or suppressing irrelevant information. Experts extract larger [...] "chunks" [...] of information and discover high-order relations and structures in their domains of expertise that are invisible to novices. Fluency effects involve changes in the ease of extraction. Not only can experts process high-order information, they do so with great speed and low <b>attentional</b> <b>load.</b> Discovery and fluency effects work together so that as the discovery structures becomes more automatic, attentional resources are conserved for discovery of new relations and for high-level thinking and problem-solving.|$|E

Thirty stroke survivors participated in this study. Temporal-spatial gait parameters (gait speed, stride time, stride length, tum time and number of steps) and axial segmental coordination across single, dual-motor and dual-cognitive task were measured during the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Researcher further divided the TUG test into turning and straight walking phases to gain information about whether <b>attentional</b> <b>loading</b> had a differential effect on each phase. A repeated measure ANOVA and the Spearmen's rank correlation coefficient were used to analyse the data. The temporal-spatial gait parameters taken during TUG test was increased significantly from single- to dual-task conditions (dual-motor and dual- cognitive). <b>Attentional</b> <b>loading</b> had a differential effect on gait speed measured during the straight walking phase of the TUG for both groups (p == 0. 001). Dual-motor and dual-cognitive task conditions led to a slower gait speed compared with the single task condition in stroke survivors (Both, p == 0. 02). However, in healthy controls, only the dual-cognitive condition led to a significantly reduced gait speed compared with single task condition (p == 0. 001) and dual-motor condition (p = 0. 01). Furthermore, dual-cognitive task condition led to a significant increase in the time taken to complete the 1800 turn in both groups. In addition, <b>attentional</b> <b>loading</b> had a significant effect on axial segment reorientation onset time (p == 0. 03), and the effect was similar between stroke survivors and healthy controls (p == 0. 54). However, only dual-cognitive task led to an earlier axial segment reorientation onset time than single task condition (p = 0. 006) in both groups. Stroke survivors showed a similar segmental reorientation sequence as the healthy controls (p = 0. 63). Furthermore, there was no significant condition effect for the head anticipation distance for both groups. There were moderate to strong negative correlation between functional balance and gait parameters (range - 0. 53 to - 0. 73, p < 0. 05). There was a weak negative correlation observed between the time taken to complete the single task and motor impairment (rѕ== - 0. 43; p =: 0. 02), dual motor task and motor impairment (rs == - 0. 41; p == 0. 02). However, there were no significant correlations between lower limb motor impairment and the number of steps in all conditions. The results of this investigation show that stroke survivors and healthy individuals had difficulty performing a turn and a secondary task simultaneously. This study has implications for stroke assessment and rehabilitation. The ability to carry out dual tasks after stroke is essential to ensure a safe and effective gait especially in outdoor settings. Thus, it is recommended that rehabilitation interventions for chronic stroke survivors should incorporate turning tasks with dual task gait training to promote the achievement of functional gaits...|$|R

Here we examined how different attentional loads affected people's steering toward a goal at both low and high travel speeds. The display (113 °H× 88 °V) simulated a participant traveling at a walking speed of 2 m/s or a driving speed of 15 m/s over a texture ground for 10 s. Participants used a joystick to control the curvature of their traveling path to steer toward a red post target. Concurrently, participants visually tracked one dot (low <b>attentional</b> <b>load)</b> or three dots (high <b>attentional</b> <b>load)</b> among eight dots that randomly moved inside a red circle (radius 3. 5 °) {{on top of the}} target post. Participants' virtual heading had a constant 10 ° offset from their straight ahead such that steering to center the target at straight ahead would result in a constant 10 ° heading error. Across nine participants, while the tracking accuracy of low <b>attentional</b> <b>load</b> was not affected by travel speed, the tracking accuracy of high <b>attentional</b> <b>load</b> decreased from 84 %± 2 % (mean±SE) to 74 %± 1 % as travel speed increased from 2 m/s to 15 m/s. For the steering performance in the trials with accurate tracking response, peak path curvature decreased and mean heading error averaged across the first 4 -s steering increased with <b>attentional</b> <b>load</b> at both travel speeds. However, after 4 -s steering, heading error converged to participants' optimal performance at each travel speed and was not affected by the <b>attentional</b> <b>load.</b> We conclude that participants have more difficulty in dealing with high attention demanding task at high than low travel speed. <b>Attentional</b> <b>load</b> affects the early stage of steering control but does not affect the final heading error. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Recent neuroimaging studies {{disagree}} as {{to whether}} the processing of emotion-laden visual stimuli is dependent upon the availability of attentional resources or entirely capacity-free. Two main factors have been proposed to be responsible for the discrepancies: the differences in the perceptual attentional demands of the tasks used to divert attentional resources from emotional stimuli and the spatial location of the affective stimuli in the visual field. To date, no neuroimaging report addressed these two issues in the same set of subjects. Therefore, the aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the effects of high and low <b>attentional</b> <b>load</b> as well as different stimulus locations on face processing in the amygdala using fMRI to provide further evidence for one of the two opposing theories.

However, the interaction between cognitive load and the effects of tDCS is currently not well-understood. We recorded the performance accuracy of participants on a bilateral multiple object tracking task while undergoing bilateral stimulation assumed to enhance (anodal) and decrease (cathodal) neuronal excitability. Stimulation was applied to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a region inferred to be at the centre of an attentional tracking network that shows load-dependent activation. 34 participants underwent three separate stimulation conditions across three days. Each subject received (1) left cathodal / right anodal PPC tDCS, (2) left anodal / right cathodal PPC tDCS, and (3) sham tDCS. The number of targets-to-be-tracked was also manipulated, giving a low (one target per visual field), medium (two targets per visual field) or high (three targets per visual field) tracking load condition. It was found that tracking performance at high <b>attentional</b> <b>loads</b> was significantly reduced in both stimulation conditions relative to sham, and this was apparent in both visual fields, regardless of the direction of polarity upon the brain’s hemispheres. We interpret this as an interaction between cognitive load and tDCS, and suggest that tDCS may degrade attentional performance when cognitive networks become overtaxed and unable to compensate as a result. Systematically varying cognitive load may therefore be a fruitful direction to elucidate the effects of tDCS upon cognitive functions...|$|R

In this event-related potential (ERP) study, participants vocalized/a/, while they heard their vocal pitch suddenly shifted downward a ½ semitone in both single and dual-task conditions. During the single-task condition participants passively viewed a visual stream for cues to start and stop vocalizing. In the dual-task condition, participants vocalized while they identified target stimuli in a visual stream of letters.

40|$|Participants {{are more}} {{accurate}} at remembering faces {{from their own}} relative to a different age group (the own-age bias, or OAB). A recent socio-cognitive account has suggested that differential allocation of attention to old versus young faces underlies this phenomenon. Critically, empirical evidence for a direct relationship between attention to own- versus other-age faces and the OAB in memory is lacking. To fill this gap, we tested the roles of attention in three different experimental paradigms, and additionally analyzed event-related brain potentials (ERPs). In Experiment 1, we compared the learning of old and young faces during focused versus divided attention, but revealed similar OABs in subsequent memory for both attention conditions. Similarly, manipulating attention during learning did not differentially affect the ERPs elicited by young versus old faces. In Experiment 2, we examined the repetition effects from task-irrelevant old and young faces presented under varying <b>attentional</b> <b>loads</b> on the N 250 r ERP component as an index of face recognition. Independent of load, the N 250 r effects were comparable for both age categories. Finally, in Experiment 3 we measured the N 2 pc as an index of attentional selection of old versus young target faces in a visual search task. The N 2 pc was not significantly different for the young versus the old target search conditions, suggesting similar orientations of attention to either face age group. Overall, we propose that the OAB in memory is largely unrelated to early attentional processes. Our findings therefore contrast with the predictions from socio-cognitive accounts on own-group biases in recognition memory, and are more easily reconciled with expertise-based models...|$|R

Sometimes {{the consequences of a}} failure of Prospective Memory (PM) can be much more serious: It is potentially very dangerous for a patient with epilepsy to forget to take their medication. In this study the multiprocess model of PM (McDaniel & Einstein, 2000) is exploited to help explore the possibility of the existence of a dissociation between patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and patients with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) in their ability to perform PM tasks. This is based on a hypothesis that TLE patients and FLE patients may show a dissociation in impaired memory and executive dysfunction, respectively. Healthy participants were tested in one of two conditions: One manipulated to exert a spontaneous retrieval process; and one manipulated to exert a continual-monitoring process. The effects of reduced memory capacity (mimicking TLE) and divided attention (mimicking FLE) on PM performance were investigated by adding extra (memory or <b>attentional)</b> <b>loads.</b> Participants also filled in a ‘Remembering to Do Things’ questionnaire to give a subjective evaluation of PM. Neither, reduced memory capacity, or divided attention was found to affect prospective remembering in either condition. Performance on the PM Task alone was better by those in the spontaneous retrieval condition. Reaction times for the ongoing lexical decision task were faster for those in the spontaneous retrieval condition when the PM Task was introduced; and even faster with the additional memory load. Introduction of the PM task slowed the reaction speeds of those in the continual-monitoring condition. The concurrent attentional task slowed reaction speeds for participants in both conditions. The results obtained have helped to illuminate the processes that may support prospective remembering and provide a valuable baseline for future studies on prospective remembering in patients with epilepsy...|$|R

In the present study, 21 RH and 22 LH subacute stroke patients and 20 controls performed a computerized single-detection task (CVRT) and a dual task (CVRT-D) combining the detection task with a driving simulation task. Omissions, reaction times (RTs) and RT asymmetries were analysed to investigate the influence of increasing <b>attentional</b> <b>load</b> on neglect symptoms.

Half of the patients with neglect on the BIT (Behavioural Inattention Test) showed increased RT asymmetries from CVRT to CVRT-D. Moreover, two LH and RH patients without neglect symptoms on the BIT and CVRT showed distinctively increased asymmetries in the CVRT-D, fostering the idea of an emergence of subtle neglect under increased <b>attentional</b> <b>load.</b> Dual-task performance may draw attention towards patients who, without obvious signs of neglect, may show visuospatial attention deficits in complex situations. ...|$|E

To investigate this issue, we utilized an fMRI task that employed movies as the encoded stimuli and manipulated <b>attentional</b> <b>load</b> via an easy or hard secondary task that was performed simultaneously with encoding.

At high load the dPCC was anti-correlated to the frontal regions, which were more functionally coherent amongst themselves. Finally and critically, greater inter-SC in the dPCC at high load during encoding predicted lower memory strength when that information was retrieved. This association between inter-SC levels and memory strength suggest that as attentional demands increased, the dPCC was more attuned to the secondary task {{at the expense of the}} encoded stimulus, thus weakening memory for the encoded stimulus. Together, our findings show that <b>attentional</b> <b>load</b> modulated the function of core TPN and DMN regions. Furthermore, the observed correlation between memory strength and the modulation of the dPCC points to this region as a key area involved in the manipulation of <b>attentional</b> <b>load</b> on memory function...|$|E
50|$|This {{particular}} hypothesis bridges the {{gap between}} the early and late selection theories. Authors integrate the viewpoint of early selection stating that perception is a limited process (i.e. cognitive resources are limited), and that of the late selection theories assuming perception as an automatic process. This view proposes that the level of processing which occurs for any one stimulus is dependent on the current perceptual load. That is, if the current task is attentionally demanding and its processing exhausts all the available resources, little remains available to process other non-target stimuli in the visual field. Alternatively, if processing requires a small amount of <b>attentional</b> resources, perceptual <b>load</b> is low and attention is inescapably directed to the non-target stimuli.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{tested the}} strong {{form of the}} perceptual-load hypothe-sis, which posits {{that the amount of}} perceptual load is the only factor {{determining}} whether attention can be effectively focused. Participants performed a visual search task under conditions of low and high load and with either a 100 % valid spatial cue or no spatial cue. With no cue, participants showed evidence of processing to-be-ignored stimuli when perceptual load was low but not when it was high, consistent with the perceptual-load hypothesis. However, with a 100 % valid spa-tial cue, participants showed little evidence of processing to-be-ignored stimuli, even when perceptual load was low. These results suggest that although perceptual load may be an important factor in <b>attentional</b> se-lectivity, <b>load</b> alone is not sufficient to explain how and when selective attention is effective. Considerable research on human attention has examined how and when attention selects information for further processing. Early-selec-tion theories propose that attentional selection occurs before informa-tion has been processed for meaning (e. g., Broadbent, 1958; Treisman, 1969), whereas late-selection theories assume information is selected after meaning has been determined (e. g., Deutsch & Deutsch, 1963). Data consistent with both approaches have fueled a heated debat...|$|R
40|$|The episodic buffer {{component}} of working memory {{is assumed to}} play a role in the binding of features into chunks. A series of experiments compared memory for arrays of colors or shapes with memory for bound combinations of these features. Demanding concurrent verbal tasks were used to investigate the role of general <b>attentional</b> processes, producing <b>load</b> effects that were no greater on memory for feature combinations than for the features themselves. However, the binding condition was significantly less accurate with sequential rather than simultaneous presentation, especially for items earlier in the sequence. The findings are interpreted as evidence of a relatively automatic but fragile visual feature binding mechanism in working memory. Implications for the concept of an episodic buffer are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe derived {{attention}} response {{functions for}} different cortical areas by plotting neural activity (measured by fMRI) {{as a function}} of <b>attentional</b> <b>load</b> in a visual tracking task. In many parietal and frontal cortical areas, activation increased with load over the entire range of loads tested, suggesting that these areas are directly involved in attentional processes. However, in other areas (FEF and parietal area 7), strong activation was observed even at the lowest <b>attentional</b> <b>load</b> (compared to a passive baseline using identical stimuli), but little or no additional activation was seen with increasing load. These latter areas appear to play a different role, perhaps supporting task-relevant functions that do not vary with load, such as the suppression of eye movements...|$|E
40|$|Human {{use both}} optic flow and target egocentric {{direction}} cues to guide selfmotion at walking speed. The first study examined whether people change their {{reliance on the}} two cues when they are controlling high-speed steering, e. g. driving a car? In Experiment 1, I simulated two viewing conditions. In the opticflow only condition, the participant's virtual gaze direction was fixed on the target which was placed 10 ° away from their straight ahead. The target egocentric direction was fixed during steering and was thus unavailable for steering control. Participants steered to align their heading but not their path of forward travel with the target at all travel speeds tested. In the optic flow-plus-egocentric direction condition, the participant's virtual gaze direction was aligned with heading which was displaced 10 ° away from their straight ahead. The target egocentric direction changed during steering and was thus available for steering control. Participants’ steering was affected by the heading displacement at all travel speeds tested. The faster and larger reduction of heading error observed at higher travel speed for both viewing conditions was mirrored {{by an increase in}} the precision of heading judgment in the corresponding heading perception experiment (Experiment 2). The findings support that while people are increasingly more accurate and efficient in using heading specified by optic flow for steering when travel speed increases, high-speed travel does not affect the type of visual strategy used for the control of steering toward a goal. The second study examined how different attentional loads affected people’s steering toward a goal at both low and high travel speeds. In Experiment 3, I used the same display setting as the optic flow-plus-egocentric direction condition in Experiment 1 for the steering task. Participants were asked to steer toward a red post target with (1) no attention tracking task, (2) concurrently tracking one dot (low <b>attentional</b> <b>load),</b> or (3) three dots (high <b>attentional</b> <b>load)</b> among eight dots that randomly moved inside the red circle on top of the target post. I found that <b>attentional</b> <b>load</b> affected the early stage of steering control but did not affect the overall visual strategy. Experiment 4 replicated Experiment 3 except that participants were specifically instructed to center the target straight ahead or align the target with heading for the steering task. I found that <b>attentional</b> <b>load</b> only affected the early stage of steering for the centering-the-target instruction group, but affected the steering performance throughout the trial for the aligning the-target-with-heading instruction group. In both Experiments 3 and 4, while the tracking accuracy was high (> 90 %) and not affected by the travel speed when the <b>attentional</b> <b>load</b> was low, it decreased more at higher travel speed when the <b>attentional</b> <b>load</b> was high. The findings suggest that people have more difficulty in dealing with high attention demanding task at high than low travel speed. Increasing <b>attentional</b> <b>load</b> affects the accuracy in using heading specified by optic flow but does not change the natural visual strategy for goal-directed selfmotion control. published_or_final_versionPsychologyMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|Background: Identifying {{markers of}} {{cognitive}} dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS) is extremely challenging since it means supplying potential biomarkers for neuroprotective therapeutic strategies. Objective: The {{aim of this}} study is to investigate the relationship between fMRI correlates of attention performance and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light chain (NFL) levels in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of MS. Methods: Twenty-one untreated, cognitively preserved CIS patients underwent BOLD-fMRI while performing the Variable Attentional Control (VAC) task, a cognitive paradigm requiring increasing levels of attentional control processing. CSF NFL was assessed by ELISA technique. SPM 8 random-effects models were used for statistical analyses of fMRI data (p< 0. 05 corrected). Results: Repeated-measures ANOVA on imaging data showed an interaction between <b>attentional</b> control <b>load</b> and NFL levels in the right putamen. At the high level of attentional control demand CIS patients with “low NFL levels” showed greater activity in the putamen compared with subjects with “high NFL levels” (p= 0. 001). These results are independent of cognitive impairment index. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a relationship between CSF NFL levels and load-dependent failure of putaminal recruitment pattern during sustained attention in CIS and suggest a role of CSF NFL as a marker of subclinical abnormality of cognitive pathway recruitment in CIS...|$|R
40|$|Over {{a decade}} ago, psychologists were {{called on to}} pay atten-tion to the how—not just the who—of human mate choice, as the dearth of {{research}} investigating the cognitive processes underlying mate choice was limiting understanding of this important decision-making domain (Miller, 1997; Miller & Todd, 1998). It is in this vein that we describe {{the results of a}} study of the effects of abundant choice on real-world mating behavior. Iyengar and Lepper’s (2000) findings support the view that although people are attracted to choice, the mere offering of choice may lead to cognitive overload, delayed choice, choice regret, and poor choice. The rationale for this “tyranny of choice” (Schwartz, 2004) centers on the cognitive costs associated with the processing of a larger number of options, such as increasing <b>attentional</b> and memory <b>load</b> (Malhotra, 1982) ...|$|R
