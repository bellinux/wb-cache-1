5|$|The {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, <b>angiogenesis,</b> and tumor invasion. Mutations and amplification of EGFR are common in non-small-cell lung carcinoma and {{provide the basis for}} treatment with EGFR-inhibitors. Her2/neu is affected less frequently. Other genes that are often mutated or amplified are c-MET, NKX2-1, LKB1, PIK3CA, and BRAF.|$|E
5|$|Telangiectasias and {{arteriovenous}} malformations in HHT {{are thought}} to arise because of changes in <b>angiogenesis,</b> the development of blood vessels out of existing ones. The {{development of a new}} blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly endothelium, smooth muscle and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias is unusually friable, which explains the tendency of these lesions to bleed.|$|E
5|$|The first stealth liposomes were passively {{targeted}} at tumor tissues. Because tumors induce rapid and uncontrolled <b>angiogenesis</b> they are especially “leaky” and allow liposomes {{to exit the}} bloodstream {{at a much higher}} rate than normal tissue would. More recently work has been undertaken to graft antibodies or other molecular markers onto the liposome surface in the hope of actively binding them to a specific cell or tissue type. Some examples of this approach are already in clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angiogenesis</b> is a {{physiological}} process involving {{the growth of}} new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels. Under normal physiological conditions <b>angiogenesis</b> is tightly regulated and is controlled by a balance of angiogenic stimulators and angiogenic inhibitors. Tumor growth is dependent upon <b>angiogenesis</b> and during tumor development a sustained production of angiogenic stimulatory factors is required along with {{a reduction in the}} quantity of angiogenic inhibitory factors tumor cells produce. The cleaved and latent form of antithrombin potently inhibit <b>angiogenesis</b> and tumor growth in animal models. The prelatent form of antithrombin has been shown to inhibit <b>angiogenesis</b> in-vitro but to date has not been tested in experimental animal models.|$|E
25|$|Class 3 Semaphorins (SEMA3s) {{regulate}} <b>angiogenesis</b> by modulating {{endothelial cell}} adhesion, migration, proliferation, survival and {{the recruitment of}} pericytes. Furthermore, semaphorins can interfere with VEGF-mediated <b>angiogenesis</b> since both SEMA3s and VEGF-A compete for Neuropilin receptor binding at endothelial cells. The relative expression levels of SEMA3s and VEGF-A may therefore be important for <b>angiogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{stimulation}} of <b>angiogenesis</b> {{is not well}} characterized. There is {{a significant amount of}} controversy with regard to shear stress acting on capillaries to cause <b>angiogenesis,</b> although current knowledge suggests that increased muscle contractions may increase <b>angiogenesis.</b> This may be due to an increase in the production of nitric oxide during exercise. Nitric oxide results in vasodilation of blood vessels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angiogenesis</b> also {{contributes}} {{to the complexity of}} the initial network; spouting endothelial buds form by an extrusion-like process which is prompted by the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These endothelial buds grow away from the parent vessel to form smaller, daughter vessels reaching into new territory. Intussusception, the phenomenon of a single tube splitting to form two branching tubes, {{also contributes}} to <b>angiogenesis.</b> <b>Angiogenesis</b> is generally responsible for colonizing individual organ systems with blood vessels, whereas vasculogenesis lays down the initial pipelines of the network. <b>Angiogenesis</b> is also known to occur during vascular remodelling.|$|E
25|$|For <b>angiogenesis</b> {{inhibition}} activity, {{an intact}} glutarimide ring {{seems to be}} required. Different groups were tested in the R position. The substances that had nitrogen salts as the R group showed good activity. The improved <b>angiogenesis</b> inhibitory activity {{could be due to}} increased solubility or that the positively charged nitrogen has added interaction with the active site. Tetrafluorination of the phthaloyl ring seems to increase the <b>angiogenesis</b> inhibition.|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{researchers}} {{studying the}} conditions necessary for cancer metastasis {{have discovered that}} one of the critical events required is the growth of a new network of blood vessels, called tumor <b>angiogenesis.</b> It has been found that <b>angiogenesis</b> inhibitors would therefore prevent the growth of metastases.|$|E
25|$|The role of <b>angiogenesis</b> in {{the support}} of myleoma was first {{discovered}} by Vacca in 1994. They discovered increased bone marrow <b>angiogenesis</b> correlates with myeloma growth and supporting stromal cells are a significant source for angiogenic molecules in myeloma. This {{is believed to be}} a main component of the mechanism in vivo by which thalidomide inhibits multiple myeloma.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{stimulation}} of <b>angiogenesis</b> is performed by various angiogenic proteins, including several growth factors.|$|E
25|$|Acquisition of {{sustained}} <b>angiogenesis,</b> allowing the tumor to grow beyond {{the limitations of}} passive nutrient diffusion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angiogenesis</b> {{inhibitor}} can be endogenous or {{come from}} outside as drug or a dietary component.|$|E
25|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) has been {{demonstrated}} {{to be a major}} contributor to <b>angiogenesis,</b> increasing the number of capillaries in a given network. Initial in vitro studies demonstrated bovine capillary endothelial cells will proliferate and show signs of tube structures upon stimulation by VEGF and bFGF, although the results were more pronounced with VEGF. Upregulation of VEGF is a major component of the physiological response to exercise and its role in <b>angiogenesis</b> is suspected to be a possible treatment in vascular injuries. In vitro studies clearly demonstrate that VEGF is a potent stimulator of <b>angiogenesis</b> because, in the presence of this growth factor, plated endothelial cells will proliferate and migrate, eventually forming tube structures resembling capillaries.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, <b>angiogenesis</b> and {{vascular}} remodelling is {{an important}} aspect of wound healing and the long-term stability of tissue grafts. When blood flow is disrupted, <b>angiogenesis</b> provides sprouting vessels which migrate into deprived tissues and restore perfusion. Thus, the study of vascular remodelling may also provide important insight into the development of new techniques to improve wound healing and benefit the integration of tissues from transplants by lowering the incidence of rejection.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{contributor}} to <b>angiogenesis</b> is matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). MMPs help degrade the proteins that keep the vessel walls solid. This proteolysis allows the endothelial cells to escape into the interstitial matrix as seen in sprouting <b>angiogenesis.</b> Inhibition of MMPs prevents the formation of new capillaries. These enzymes are highly regulated during the vessel formation process because destruction of the extracellular matrix would decrease {{the integrity of the}} microvasculature.|$|E
25|$|Endothelial cells use the Notch {{signaling}} pathway to coordinate cellular behaviors during the blood vessel sprouting {{that occurs in}} <b>angiogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|By intussusception, {{also known}} as {{splitting}} <b>angiogenesis,</b> a new blood vessel is created by splitting of an existing blood vessel in two.|$|E
25|$|Delta-like ligand 4 (DII4) is {{a protein}} with a {{negative}} regulatory effect on <b>angiogenesis.</b> Dll4 is a transmembrane ligand, for the notch family of receptors.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} for stimulation <b>angiogenesis</b> {{in the heart}} is using FGF gene (instead of the protein) delivered by adenoviral vectors (e.g. Ad5FGF-4, Generx) during intracoronary infusion.|$|E
25|$|Mir-126 {{is a human}} microRNA that is {{expressed}} only in endothelial cells, throughout capillaries as well as larger blood vessels, and acts upon various transcripts to control <b>angiogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Metastasis is {{the major}} cause of tumor lethality. However, not every tumor cell can metastasize. This {{potential}} depends on factors that determine growth, <b>angiogenesis,</b> invasion and other basic processes.|$|E
25|$|The Notch {{signaling}} pathway is {{a critical component of}} cardiovascular formation and morphogenesis in both development and disease. It is required for the selection of endothelial tip and stalk cells during sprouting <b>angiogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both {{in vitro}} and in vivo, ROS {{have been shown}} to induce {{transcription}} factors and modulate signaling molecules involved in <b>angiogenesis</b> (MMP, VEGF) and metastasis (upregulation of AP-1, CXCR4, AKT and downregulation of PTEN).|$|E
25|$|Angiogenesis-based tumor therapy {{relies on}} natural and {{synthetic}} <b>angiogenesis</b> inhibitors like angiostatin, endostatin and tumstatin. These are proteins that mainly originate as specific fragments of pre-existing structural proteins like collagen or plasminogen.|$|E
25|$|Activation of the Hedgehog pathway {{leads to}} an {{increase}} in Snail protein expression and a decrease in E-cadherin and Tight Junctions. Hedgehog signaling also appears to be a crucial regulator of <b>angiogenesis</b> and thus metastasis.|$|E
25|$|Besides FGF-1, one of {{the most}} {{important}} functions of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2 or bFGF) is the promotion of endothelial cell proliferation and the physical organization of endothelial cells into tube-like structures, thus promoting <b>angiogenesis.</b> FGF-2 is a more potent angiogenic factor than VEGF or PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor); however, it is less potent than FGF-1. As well as stimulating blood vessel growth, aFGF (FGF-1) and bFGF (FGF-2) are important players in wound healing. They stimulate the proliferation of fibroblasts and endothelial cells that give rise to <b>angiogenesis</b> and developing granulation tissue; both increase blood supply and fill up a wound space/cavity early in the wound-healing process.|$|E
25|$|The disease {{progresses}} {{by forming}} granulation tissue {{at the edges}} of the synovial lining, pannus with extensive <b>angiogenesis</b> and enzymes causing tissue damage. The synovium thickens, cartilage and underlying bone begin to disintegrate and the joint is getting destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Early {{clinical}} studies with protein-based therapeutics largely {{focused on the}} intravenous or intracoronary administration of a particular growth factor to stimulate <b>angiogenesis</b> in the affected tissue or organ. Most of these trials did not achieve statistically significant improvements in their clinical endpoints. This ultimately led to an abandonment of this approach and a widespread belief in the field that protein therapy, especially with a single agent, was not a viable option to treat ischemic cardiovascular disease. However, the failure of gene- or cell-based therapy to deliver a suitable treatment choice for diseases resulting from poor blood flow {{has led to a}} resurgence of interest in returning to protein-based therapy to stimulate <b>angiogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The modern {{clinical}} {{application of}} the principle of <b>angiogenesis</b> can be divided into two main areas: anti-angiogenic therapies, which angiogenic research began with, and pro-angiogenic therapies. Whereas anti-angiogenic therapies are being employed to fight cancer and malignancies, which require an abundance of oxygen and nutrients to proliferate, pro-angiogenic therapies are being explored as options to treat cardiovascular diseases, the number one cause of death in the Western world. One of the first applications of pro-angiogenic methods in humans was a German trial using fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1) for the treatment of coronary artery disease. Clinical research in therapeutic <b>angiogenesis</b> is ongoing for a variety of atherosclerotic diseases, like coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, wound healing disorders, etc.|$|E
25|$|MMP-9 is {{associated}} with the bone microenvironment. It is expressed by osteoclasts, and is known to be required for osteoclast migration and is a powerful gelatinase. Transgenic mice lacking MMP-9 develop defects in bone development, intraosseous <b>angiogenesis,</b> and fracture repair.|$|E
25|$|SCO-spondin may {{interfere}} with several biological events during early ontogenetical development of the CNS. Nevertheless, SCO-spondin is also present during the adult life, and similarly to thrombospondins, which act on various biological systems, i.e., neuronal differentiation, <b>angiogenesis</b> and platelet aggregation.|$|E
25|$|Methionine (abbreviated as Met or M) is an {{essential}} amino acid in humans. Methionine is important in <b>angiogenesis,</b> the growth of new blood vessels, and supplementation may benefit those suffering from Parkinson's, drug withdrawal, schizophrenia, radiation, copper poisoning, asthma, allergies, alcoholism, or depression.|$|E
25|$|The various biologically active {{molecules}} secreted by microglia stimulate and recruit endothelial {{cells and}} fibroblasts. These cells help stimulate <b>angiogenesis</b> and collagen secretion into the injured area. Ultimately, {{the amount of}} capillaries extended into the injured area is twice that of uninjured central nervous system regions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angiogenesis</b> {{represents}} an excellent therapeutic {{target for the}} treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is a potent, physiological process that underlies the natural manner in which our bodies respond to a diminution of blood supply to vital organs, namely the production of new collateral vessels to overcome the ischemic insult. A large number of preclinical studies have been performed with protein-, gene- and cell-based therapies in animal models of cardiac ischemia, as well as models of peripheral artery disease. Reproducible and credible successes in these early animal studies led to high enthusiasm that this new therapeutic approach could be rapidly translated to a clinical benefit for millions of patients in the Western world suffering from these disorders. A decade of clinical testing both gene- and protein-based therapies designed to stimulate <b>angiogenesis</b> in underperfused tissues and organs, however, has led from one disappointment to another. Although all of these preclinical readouts, which offered great promise for the transition of <b>angiogenesis</b> therapy from animals to humans, were in one fashion or another, incorporated into early stage clinical trials, the FDA has, to date (2007), insisted that the primary endpoint for approval of an angiogenic agent must be an improvement in exercise performance of treated patients.|$|E
25|$|A small genetic study {{looked at}} fifteen MS {{patients}} {{who also had}} CCSVI. It found 234 specific copy number variations in the human leukocyte antigen focus. Of these, GRB2, HSPA1L and HSPA1A {{were found to be}} specifically connected to both MS and <b>angiogenesis,</b> TAF11 was connected to both MS and artery passage, and HLA-DQA2 was suggestive of having an implication for <b>angiogenesis</b> as it interacts with CD4. A study in 268 MS patients and 155 controls reported more a frequency of CCSVI in the MS group that was more than twice as high as in the controls group and was also higher in the progressive MS group than in the non-progressive MS group. This study found no relationship between CCSVI and HLA DRB1*1501, a genetic variation that has been consistently linked to MS.|$|E
