25|$|As expected, {{the first}} three games of the series were tight-checking, low-scoring {{contests}} featuring stellar goaltending {{at both ends of}} the ice. Niittymaki, however, who was just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>better</b> than Lehtonen, earned a surprise 1–0 shutout victory in Game 1. He was even better in Game 2, however, holding the high-scoring Wolves to just one goal in a 2–1 double overtime victory to send the series back to Philadelphia where the next three games—if necessary—would be played and where the Phantoms were already 11–0 in the playoffs. Niittymaki again held the Wolves to just one goal as the Phantoms defeated Chicago again, 2–1, in Game 3. Through almost 11 periods of hockey over three games, Niittymaki had allowed the Wolves, who had scored 245 regular season goals, just two goals while Lehtonen and had been solved for just five by the Phantoms. The differential of three goals, however, was enough to give Philadelphia a 3–0 stranglehold on the series going into Game 4 on June 10.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. When asked about how he performed his comeback, di Grassi {{said he did not}} know but praised his mechanics for their work. He stated that the race showed that Formula E could switch to [...] "Heaven to Hell in one go", and felt if the third safety car period had not intervened, he could have managed his advantage over Vergne. He also revealed that on three occasions during the race, he believed that the possibility of him securing the victory had ended. Vergne, who finished in second, had mixed emotions, feeling that the victory was in his grasp but was happy that he secured a place on the podium and was in contention for the championship: [...] "We started very far away but I know I’m in the right team with the right car to win the championship. I think we’re coming back <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>better</b> and we’re getting stronger every race as a team." [...] Third-place finisher Bird said that it was [...] "a good race" [...] for everyone who watched the event on television and the sport. He felt the action observed in the race was positive for the series. Bird also said he was happy with the passing manoeuvre he performed on d'Ambrosio and reserved praise for his team.|$|E

500|$|Blair Marnell of Crave Online {{noted that}} [...] "Night Terrors" [...] was {{reminiscent}} of the second series episode [...] "Fear Her", but said that this episode [...] "fared <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>better</b> because it didn't rely on Jamie Oram's George to be {{anything more than a}} scared little boy". She also praised Matt Smith's performance and Arthur Darvill's Rory, who was [...] "quickly becoming one of the funniest companions of the new Doctor Who", though she commented that Amy's transformation into a doll was [...] "kind of glossed over within the story itself" [...] and [...] "there was never any doubt that it would be reversed". Overall, the episode was given a 7 out of 10 rating. Sam McPherson, writing for Zap2it, called [...] "Night Terrors" [...] the [...] "worst episode of series 6 so far" [...] that was an [...] "incoherent mess of an episode that was utterly unenjoyable" [...] and gave it an overall grade of a C+. He criticised the idea to follow up a story arc-heavy episode with a standalone one, as he felt it [...] "served as a speed bump for the forward momentum started in [...] "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] and continued through [...] "Let's Kill Hitler". He thought that its [...] "biggest flaw" [...] was that George was sidelined in favour of Alex, which missed an opportunity to make it a story [...] "about little boys overcoming fear and fighting off the monsters in their closets". However, he did praise dialogue delivered by Smith and Darvill.|$|E

The singers were also going to perform the track on Clive Davis' Pre-Grammy Party in 2012, along with [...] "The Boy is Mine".

"Better Dead" [...] is, by my wish, {{no longer}} on sale in Great Britain, and I should have {{preferred}} not to see it here, for it {{is in no way}} worthy of the beautiful clothes Messrs.

Weighted with [...] "An Edinburgh Eleven" [...] it would rest very comfortably in the mill dam, but the publishers have reasons for its inclusion; among them, I suspect, is a well-grounded fear that if I once began to hack and hew, I should not stop until I had reduced the edition to two volumes. This juvenile effort is a field of prickles into which none may be advised to penetrate--I made the attempt lately in cold blood and came back shuddering, but I had read enough to have the profoundest reason for declining to tell what the book is about. And yet I have a sentimental interest in [...] "Better Dead," [...] for it was my first--published when I had small hope of getting any one to accept the Scotch--and there was a week when I loved to carry it in my pocket and did not think it dead weight. Once I almost saw it find a purchaser. She was a pretty girl and it lay on a bookstall, and she read some pages and smiled, and then retired, and came back and began another chapter. Several times she did this, and I stood in the background trembling with hope and fear. At last she went away without the book, but I am still of opinion that, had it been just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>better,</b> she would have bought it.|$|E
