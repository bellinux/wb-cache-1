5|$|Aboard the ship, Jill <b>and</b> <b>Parker</b> enter a {{room where}} they believe Chris is being held, realizing too late {{that it was a}} trap set by a Veltro operative. Meanwhile, Chris and Jessica find a base of {{operations}} for Veltro; the Valkoinen Mökki airstrip in the mountains. Being informed by O'Brian that Jill <b>and</b> <b>Parker</b> are missing in the Mediterranean, they are redeployed to investigate their whereabouts. O'Brian also sends BSAA agents Quint Cetcham and Keith Lumley to Valkoinen Mökki to gather information. Awakening in separate locked rooms, Jill <b>and</b> <b>Parker</b> manage to regroup and witness a video transmission of a Veltro member threatening to infect one fifth of the Earth's oceans with the T-Abyss, which was created in retaliation to the FBC for their involvement in the destruction of Veltro's forces on Terragrigia. Jill <b>and</b> <b>Parker</b> reach the ship's antenna to request evacuation, but learn that FBC director Morgan Lansdale activated a satellite attack on the Queen Zenobia, which floods the ship with water.|$|E

5|$|Director of {{photography}} Darius Khondji was initially reluctant about {{working on a}} musical but was inspired by Parker's passion for the project. For the film's visual style, Khondji <b>and</b> <b>Parker</b> were influenced by the works of American realist painter George Bellows. Khondji shot Evita using Moviecam cameras, with Cooke anamorphic lenses. He used Eastman EXR 5245 film stock for exteriors in Argentina, 5293 for the Argentinean interiors, and 5248 for any scenes shot during overcast days and combat sequences.|$|E
5|$|Ripley, Lambert, <b>and</b> <b>Parker</b> {{agree to}} self-destruct the Nostromo and escape in the shuttle. Parker and Lambert {{are killed by}} the alien while {{gathering}} life-support supplies. Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence and heads with the cat to the shuttle to find the alien in her path. She retreats and attempts unsuccessfully to abort the self-destruct. She returns to the shuttle, where the alien is gone, and she narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the Nostromo explodes.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews for}} its portrayal of homosexuality. Creators Stone <b>and</b> <b>Parker</b> considered it their favorite {{episode of the}} first season, noting that it helped elevate the credibility and relevance of South Park during its early days. It was nominated for both an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program and a GLAAD Award for Outstanding Individual Episode, and was the episode submitted when South Park won a CableACE Award for Outstanding Animated Series.|$|E
40|$|Buildings can be located, {{designed}} {{and managed to}} optimize transportation <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> efficiency. This paper describes ways to improve LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) transportation <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> credits. Typical LEED programs reduce building energy consumption 20 - 60 %. Cost effective mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management programs can provide similar motor vehicle trip <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> generation reductions, resulting in large economic, social and environmental benefits. However, the current LEED rating system overlooks {{some of the most}} effective mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management strategies <b>and</b> encourages practitioners to choose strategies based on ease of implementation rather than effectiveness. As a result, the current LEED rating system is unlikely to implement mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management to the degree optimal. This paper recommends a different approach which defines performance targets needed to achieve LEED categories (silver, gold, platinum). Developers would establish mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management plans that indicate how targets will be met, how performance will be evaluated, and what additional strategies will be deployed if needed to achieve targets. This optimizes mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management programs, <b>and</b> responds to changing demands. However, it is unnecessary to wait for a major reform to improve and expand LEED transportation credits; new credits proposed in this paper could be quickly incorporated into the existing LEED rating system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{time-dependent}} network equilibrium model that simultaneously considers a traveler's choice of departure time, route, <b>parking</b> location <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> duration in road networks with multiple user classes <b>and</b> multiple <b>parking</b> facilities. In the proposed model, travelers are differentiated by their trip purpose <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> duration, parking locations {{are characterized by}} facility type <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> charge, <b>and</b> the decision-making process of travelers on travel <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> choices is assumed to follow a hierarchical choice structure. The model is formulated as a variational inequality problem, and is solved by a heuristic solution algorithm. Numerical results for two example networks are presented to show the solution quality and investigate the solution sensitivities to some input data. It is found that parking behavior is significantly affected by travel demand, walking distance, <b>parking</b> capacity, <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> charge. The proposed model provides {{a useful tool for}} studying the complex temporal and spatial interaction between road traffic <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> congestion, <b>and</b> can be used to assess the effects of various <b>parking</b> policies <b>and</b> infrastructure improvements at a strategic level. ...|$|R
5000|$|Burr Ridge {{includes}} 10 major parks. The largest <b>park,</b> <b>and</b> {{home of the}} Burr Ridge Park District, is Harvester Park.

5|$|After {{recording}} drums, {{bass and}} most of the guitars, the band, Giordano <b>and</b> <b>Parker</b> moved to Water Music in Hoboken, New Jersey. The rest of the guitars and the vocals, strings and cowbells were recorded there, and recording was complete by April. Giordano, Parker and Ted Young mixed the recordings, and Ted Jensen did the mastering; Mike Sapone contributed programming to the songs. Girl Next Door String Quartet provided the strings, arranged by conductor Ray Zu-Artez (who played piano). Neil Rubenstein of These Enzymes and Nick Torres of Northstar contributed vocals to some songs. In retrospect, Fred Mascherino considered the sessions rushed.|$|E
5|$|As time passes, {{with no sign}} of land {{or other}} ships, Parker {{suggests}} that one of them should be killed as food for the others. They draw straws, following the Custom of the Sea <b>and</b> <b>Parker</b> is sacrificed. This gives the others a reprieve, but Augustus soon dies from wounds received when they reclaimed the Grampus, and several more storms batter the already badly damaged ship. Pym and Peters float on the upturned hull and are close to death when they are rescued by the Jane Guy, a ship out of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Derek Meddings {{and a team}} of 28 {{technicians}} {{completed the}} special effects shots for the film in six months. Their main assignments included the Zero-X launches, re-shot, widescreen launch sequences for the Thunderbird machines, the car chase between Lady Penelope <b>and</b> <b>Parker</b> in FAB1 and the Hood, scenes at The Swinging Star, the Mars shots involving the MEV and the mysterious Rock Snakes, and the ultimate destruction of Zero-X in the climax. Over 300 effects shot were completed with scale models. The team made use of the extra space afforded to them by the new special effects building to experiment with floor-level shots and other more creative camera angles.|$|E

5|$|Duncan {{started the}} 2008–09 season with strong showings in points and rebounds per game. However, by mid-season, his {{performance}} declined {{and he was}} subsequently diagnosed with chronic knee tendinosis. Despite Duncan having problems with his knee and the team losing the services of shooting guard Ginóbili {{for most of the}} season, San Antonio qualified for the playoffs as the third seed with a 54–28 record. Coupled with an aging supporting cast (Bowen, Michael Finley and Kurt Thomas were all in their late 30s), however, the Spurs were only considered fringe contenders for the championship. As it turned out, Duncan <b>and</b> <b>Parker</b> were not enough to help the Spurs avoid a 4–1 defeat by Dallas, and the Spurs were eliminated {{in the first round of}} the playoffs for the first time since 2000.|$|E
5|$|Gerolmo {{began work}} on the {{original}} script in 1985, after researching the 1964 murders of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner. He and producer Frederick Zollo took the script to Orion Pictures, <b>and</b> <b>Parker</b> was subsequently hired by the studio to direct the film. Both the writer and director had disputes over the script, which resulted in Orion allowing Parker to make uncredited rewrites. Principal photography commenced in March 1988 and concluded in May of that year with a budget of $15 million. The film was shot {{in a number of}} locales in Mississippi and Alabama.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, while {{a sophomore}} at Pennsylvania State University, Parker and his roommate and wrestling teammate, Jean McGianni Celestin, were accused of raping a fellow student. The unnamed accuser stated that Parker and Celestin raped her while she was {{intoxicated}} and unconscious, {{and that she was}} unsure of how many people had been involved. The woman later went to a doctor, who concluded that she had been sexually assaulted, and local authorities taped a phone conversation between her <b>and</b> <b>Parker</b> in which Parker confirmed that it was he and Celestin who had sex with her. She also stated that the two harassed her after she pressed charges, and that they hired a private investigator who showed her picture around campus, revealing her identity.|$|E
