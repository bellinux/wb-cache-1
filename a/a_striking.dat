2500|$|Suppose {{the current}} stock price of IBM is $100. A call or put option with <b>a</b> <b>strike</b> of $100 is at-the-money. A call with <b>a</b> <b>strike</b> of $80 is in-the-money (100 [...] 80 = 20 > 0). A put option with <b>a</b> <b>strike</b> at $80 is out-of-the-money (80 [...] 100 = 20 < 0). Conversely, a call option with <b>a</b> $120 <b>strike</b> is out-of-the-money and a put option with <b>a</b> $120 <b>strike</b> is in-the-money.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} varieties of <b>strikes.</b> <b>A</b> <b>strike</b> with the hand closed into a fist is called <b>a</b> punch, <b>a</b> <b>strike</b> with the leg or foot {{is referred to as}} a kick and <b>a</b> <b>strike</b> with the head is called a headbutt.

5|$|Although van der Weyden did not {{adhere to}} the {{conventions}} of idealisation, he generally sought to flatter his sitters. He depicted his models in highly fashionable clothing, often with rounded—almost sculpted—facial features, some of which deviated from natural representation. He adapted his own aesthetic, and his portraits of women often bear <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> resemblance to each other.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{game for}} 2 players per team. The first player bowls his or her first ball. If it is <b>a</b> <b>strike,</b> the team scores <b>a</b> <b>strike.</b> If not, the second player {{has a chance to}} make <b>a</b> <b>strike,</b> and scores <b>a</b> <b>strike</b> for the team if successful. If neither player strikes, the team has to decide which spare to shoot at, and gets only one spare attempt, thrown by {{whichever}} player left the spare. This format was originally developed by bowling legend Don Carter, and is compared to the scramble format in golf.|$|R
25|$|There are countless ways a bowler {{can achieve}} <b>a</b> <b>strike.</b> However, {{the goal for}} a bowler on every first ball is to achieve <b>a</b> <b>strike</b> using the method that generates the highest <b>strike</b> percentage. <b>A</b> perfect <b>strike</b> is <b>a</b> <b>strike</b> where the ball hits only four pins: the one, three, five and nine pins. The ball enters the one-three pocket, and then falls into the pit area {{to the right of}} where the eight pin {{previously}} stood.|$|R

5|$|The {{anticoagulant}} rivaroxaban (Xarelto) bears <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> structural {{similarity to}} linezolid; both drugs share the oxazolidinone pharmacophore, differing in only three areas (an extra ketone and chlorothiophene, and missing the fluorine atom). However this similarity appears to carry no clinical significance.|$|E

50|$|In baseball, <b>a</b> first-pitch <b>strike</b> is {{when the}} pitcher throws <b>a</b> <b>strike</b> to the batter during the first pitch of the at bat.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>striking</b> {{feature of}} {{metabolism}} is {{the similarity of}} the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species. For example, the set of carboxylic acids that are {{best known as the}} intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants. These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E

The climate is relatively mild and, because of the Gulf Stream, frosts are rare in winter.|$|E

5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} <b>a</b> <b>striking</b> {{example of what}} can happen when the popular media are unable to report on {{activities}} that the government may be trying to hide. Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E
