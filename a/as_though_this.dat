5|$|The {{way this}} man's dark hair grows, with the sharp {{dip in the}} middle of his high forehead, as though concentrating there all the energy of the {{masculine}} M, makes his face different from all the others. His coal-black eyes are rigidly focused in a gaze that expresses compelling force. The nose is unusually long and boldly curved. The mouth is wide and sensual, but the lips are firmly shut in a straight line, the corners strongly marked and tightened into final points, and this strengthens the impression — already suggested by the eyes — of a strong controlling will. It is an extraordinarily fascinating face, reminding us of faces of famous men, especially of Machiavelli's; and indeed the whole aspect of the head suggests something Mediterranean, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> man had acquired his frank, searching, superior air at Italian academies.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his other teachings, {{he was able to}} teach a psychological test and measurement course. Because he loved the mathematical portion of the course, he changed the class to aptitude testing, which focused on scientific basis of vocational guidance. On the side, Hull also conducted research to build a machine that could perform all the correlational work for him automatically. After teaching the aptitude testing class, Clark went on to teaching an introductory class for premedical students. While teaching this class he particularly took notice of suggestion and hypnosis. This was the starting point of his experimental testing in this field in which Clark focused on the quantitative methodology in experimental psychology. After ten years of in-depth research, he wrote the book Hypnosis and Suggestibility in 1933. After writing the book, he decided to continue in experimental field by teaching this course in {{addition to}} the premedical course. Clark had a great desire to teach this course and felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> specific type of science was the foundation of true psychology. In 1929 he was called to the Institute of Psychology at Yale University as a research professor of psychology where he worked on the problems concerning systematic behavior theory. In 1930, he came to several conclusions about psychology: the first was that he believed that psychology is a true natural science. The second was that its primary laws are expressed quantitatively by moderate number equations and that all complex behavior or single individuals will be derived as second laws. The third was that the primary laws with the behavior (based on the condition) can also be derived as quantitative laws from the same primary equation. he and other psychologists (Neal E. Miller, John Dollard, and O.H Mower) looked into these ideas more, they sought to understand what underlined conditioned reflex and behavior while also seeking to understand Freud and others like him. This eventually led to his work that he is primarily known for: Principles of Behavior.|$|E

However, Scott recorded the event calmly in his journal. [...] "One thing only fixes itself in my mind.

The snout is flattened and blunt, with large flaps of skin {{in front of the}} nares that are furled into tubes. The eyes are small and oval with vertical pupils and prominent ridges above, and are often followed by a small notch. The mouth has a distinct downward slant (imparting a disgruntled expression to the shark), with short furrows at the corners. There are 4250 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 4248 tooth rows in the lower jaw. Each tooth has a single narrow, smooth-edged cusp at the center, flanked by a pair of much smaller cusplets.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club Alasdair Wilkins gave [...] "The Bells of Saint John" [...] a {{grade of}} B, {{explaining}} that the plot suffered just as previous companion introductions had because the threat was secondary to establishing Clara. He also wrote that the episode [...] "struggles to make all its chosen genre elements compelling" [...] and was not positive towards the menace of the Wi-Fi and questioned how realistic the technology seen was. Despite this, {{he said that it}} was still [...] "fun" [...] with good performances. Dan Martin of The Guardian was disappointed, writing that it [...] "makes a hearty meal of its iconic London locations ... But after the tour de force that was [...] "The Snowmen", it feels <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> handsome episode constantly just misses the mark". He found the monsters and plot familiar to past episodes, but noted that a [...] "generic" [...] opening episode had been common for the show when it was introducing a new companion, which was done successfully with Clara. Neela Debnath in The Independent echoed similar sentiments, feeling that it did not live up to the hype and reused several elements from previous episodes. Jon Cooper of the Daily Mirror wrote that [...] "The Bells of Saint John" [...] "had its moments" [...] but [...] "as a whole it didn't reach the heights of previous episodes". While he welcomed the departure in tone, he felt that the set-pieces were shoehorned in, and also expressed concern that Clara, despite Coleman's success, was too similar to previous companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan).|$|E

500|$|During the regal period, {{the king}} {{nominated}} two Quaestors {{to serve as}} his assistants, and after {{the overthrow of the}} monarchy, the Consuls retained this authority. However, in 447 BC, Cicero recorded that the Quaestors began to be elected by a tribal assembly that was presided over by a magistrate. It seems <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> was the first instance of a joint Patricio-Plebeian Tribal Assembly, and thus was probably an enormous gain for the Plebeians. While Patricians were able to vote in a joint assembly, there were never very many Patricians in Rome. Thus, most of the electors were Plebeians, and yet any magistrate elected by a joint assembly had jurisdiction over both Plebeians and Patricians. Therefore, for the first time, the Plebeians seemed to have indirectly acquired authority over Patricians. During the 4th century BC, a series of reforms were passed (the leges Valeriae Horatiae), which ultimately required that any law passed by the Plebeian Council have the full force of law over both Plebeians and Patricians. This gave the Plebeian Tribunes, who presided over the Plebeian Council, a positive character for the first time. Before these laws were passed, Tribunes could only interpose the sacrosanctity of their person (intercessio) to veto acts of the senate, assemblies, or magistrates. It was a modification to the Valerian law in 449 BC which first allowed acts of the Plebeian Council to have the full force of law, but eventually the final law in the series was passed (the [...] "Hortensian Law"), which removed the last check that the Patricians in the senate had over this power.|$|E

2500|$|Animal Boy {{featured}} {{a range of}} genres and musical elements {{that had never been}} seen in previous albums.

[...] "The main problem with Animal Boy" [...] explain author Everett True, [...] "was that there was no longer one discernible Ramones sound: it sounds as disjointed as the band members probably felt. The guitar parts could've been played by anyone, and Richie's drumming was slipping away from Tommy's original template. The Ramones were turning into a 9-5 job, night not day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frame asks {{where we}} can find moral {{responsibility}} and freedom in Kant's scheme. He argues that Kant believed that while we couldn't prove that man was a responsible moral agent we must nevertheless act <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> were the case. Philosophers have described these as Kant’s [...] "two worlds" [...] the world of nature (which leads to determinism), {{and the world of}} freedom (where responsibility is found). Kant himself spoke of the [...] "starry skies above" [...] and the [...] "moral law within", and although Kant did not deny the regularity of the natural world and the reality of humanity’s [...] "moral motions," [...] his philosophy could not bring these two worlds together. Frame concludes that Kant made the [...] "upper story leap" [...] to irrationalism by asserting the truth of something with no rational justification. Thus, in Immanuel Kant, Frame finds both rationalism and irrationalism.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} of the album for AllMusic, Bruce Eder noted that {{although}} (Untitled) was always considered by fans to be [...] "the one to own" [...] among the band's post-1968 output, it has, since its initial release, risen in the estimation of some critics {{more than any other}} Byrds' album. Eder goes on to attempt to evaluate the album's significance within the context of The Byrds' back catalogue: [...] "listening to this album nearly 40 years later, it now seems <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> is the place where the latter-day version of the group finally justified itself as something more important than just a continuation of the mid-'60s band." [...] In his 2000 review for The Austin Chronicle, Raoul Hernandez gave the album a rating of four stars out of five, describing it as [...] "beginning with a biting live set before giving way to a studio side of crackling Americana fare." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{the album}} did not gain much {{attention}} from the general press on its original release, the album retrospectively has been given critical acclaim and has been cited {{as one of the}} most important hardcore punk albums ever released. Rolling Stone in their retrospective review says that [...] "Black Flag lived up to it, defining L.A. hardcore punk with violent guitar and the pissed-off scream of Henry Rollins, especially on [...] "TV Party" [...] and [...] "Rise Above." [...] Punks still listen to Damaged, and parents still hate it." [...] Pitchfork in their retrospective review from 2002 says [...] "Black Flag took on the essential ferocity of men about to snap, and combined that with an acidic sense of humor and these things called 'songs', a concept that many of the wannabe punkers of the day were still trying to sort out. Damaged hit in 1981, and by 1982, four bars bearing the Black Flag name had been airbrushed across miles and miles of spiked leather. Conflicting feelings of violence, apathy, rage, and self-satire course through this one, the essential touchstone of the entire genre of West Coast hardcore, crystallizing the turmoil of the movement. Listen to 'Rise Above' and try not to be incensed, then listen to 'TV Party' and try not to laugh out loud. That's awesome." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a very high rating of a [...] "A-" [...] and saying [...] "...Greg Ginn is the greatest noise guitarist since Johnny Thunders, new vocalist Henry Rollins can snarl along any tortured contour they serve up, and 'Rise Above', 'Six Pack', and the uproarious 'TV Party' prove they can write songs as well as gnash fragments." [...] John Dougan of AllMusic gave it a perfect five star rating saying [...] "...Although Black Flag had been recording for three years prior to this release, the fact that Henry Rollins was now their lead singer made all the difference. His furious bellow and barely contained ferocity was the missing piece the band needed to become great. Also, guitarist/mastermind Greg Ginn wrote a slew of great songs for this record that, while suffused with the usual punk conceits (alienation, boredom, disenfranchisement), were capable of making one laugh out loud, especially the protoslacker satire 'TV Party'..." [...] and also noted [...] "...Extremely controversial when it was released, Damaged endured the slings and arrows of outrageous criticism (some reacted <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> record alone would cause the fall of America's youth) to become and remain an important document of its time." ...|$|E
