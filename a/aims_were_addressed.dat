40|$|Based on {{attachment}} theory, two <b>aims</b> <b>were</b> <b>addressed.</b> First, {{we tested}} whether close teacher-child relationships may buffer {{children who are}} less securely attached to their mothers against negative outcomes, such as aggressive behavior. Second, our study evaluated whether teacher sensitivity may protect less securely attached children against forming less close relationships with their teachers. In a sample of 127 children, mother-child attachment was observed in preschool. In kindergarten, teacher sensitivity was observed and teacher-child closeness and child aggressive behavior were rated by the teacher. Results of multilevel hierarchical regression analyses first showed that with high teacher-child closeness, less securely attached children are no longer at risk for more aggressive behavior. Second, {{it was found that}} with high teacher sensitivity, less securely attached children are no longer at risk for developing less close relationships with their teachers. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Angiotensin {{converting}} enzyme (ACE) {{is a key}} regulator {{of blood}} pressure and comprised of two homologous domains (N- and C-domain), {{both of which are}} glycosylated. N-linked glycosylation is important for the processing, expression and stability of ACE, but it interferes with protein crystallization. Previously, the N-glycan site occupancy required for the expression and stability of the individual domains of ACE was determined using minimally glycosylated (MG) N- and C-domain isoforms. However the role of glycosylation in the structure and function of the full-length somatic ACE (sACE) has remained elusive. A novel MG-sACE mutant, comprised of previously characterized MG N- and C-domains was generated. Unfortunately, the protein was susceptible to limited proteolysis in the interdomain linker region, suggesting that key glycans might shield the linker region from proteolysis. Furthermore, a loss in expression of MG-sACE was observed. These observations prompted the investigation of the effect of N-glycosylation on protection from inter-domain linker proteolysis, expression and overall stability of sACE. These <b>aims</b> <b>were</b> <b>addressed</b> by generating a panel of sACE glycosylation mutants...|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the relationships between parental depression, offspring depression, and offspring temperament among 203 offspring at high or low-risk for depression. Offspring were followed over a 20 -year study period. Two primary study <b>aims</b> <b>were</b> <b>addressed.</b> First, we sought to confirm that parental depression predicts offspring lifetime depression and offspring difficult temperament, and that offspring difficult temperament predicts offspring major depression, while adjusting for family effect. Second, we sought to examine the pathoplasty model {{of the relationship between}} temperament and psychopathology by examining how offspring difficult temperament affects qualitative features of major depression - specifically, frequency, severity, and duration. Results indicate that high-risk offspring have more difficult temperament and are four {{times more likely to have}} lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD) than low-risk offspring. In addition, offspring with a difficult temperament are twice as likely to have lifetime MDD than low-risk offspring. Results from aim 2 revealed that difficult temperament predicts greater frequency of lifetime MDEs, but not severity or duration. Finally, individual dimensions of temperament were uniquely associated with frequency, severity, and duration of major depressive episodes differentially across risk groups.

The frequency of clinically significant fatigue, whether fatigue {{is likely to be}} more or less problematic over time, and its aetiology are unknown. There are currently no known treatments. One hypothesis is that fatigue after stroke is triggered by physical deconditioning which sets up a self-perpetuating cycle of fatigue, avoidance of physical activity, further deconditioning and more fatigue. Another theory is that low mood may contribute to fatigue. Aims: This thesis therefore aims to investigate the frequency and natural history of fatigue after stroke and to explore its associations with mood, physical activity and/or fitness. Method: These <b>aims</b> <b>were</b> <b>addressed</b> by carrying out: 1) a systematic review of all longitudinal observational studies which have assessed fatigue on at least two separate time points and reported its frequency, 2) a systematic review of all observational studies which have measured both fatigue poststroke and one or more measures of physical activity and/or fitness at the same time point and 3) a longitudinal cohort study which assessed clinically significant fatigue, mood and physical activity and fitness at one, six and 12 months after stroke.

The aim of this thesis is twofold.   First, to estimate and compare informal care time valuations using a number of methods, and second, to estimate econometrically the determinants of informal care provision.   The first <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> <b>addressed</b> using both new and existing secondary data, with comparison of values across opportunity cost, market replacement cost, compensating income variation, contingent valuation and discrete choice experiments methods.   The second <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> <b>addressed</b> using existing secondary data, where methods of dynamic panel estimation are employed to assess the influence of various socio-economic and demographic characteristics on the decision to provide care and on the level of provision. This is the first study that estimates and compares informal care time valuations using preference-based techniques for the UK and also {{it is the first time}} that the determinants of informal care are assessed using dynamic two-part data models. Findings suggest per hour valuations from £ 8. 5 to £ 14 for most of the methods with the exception of the choice experiment (with values less than £ 1).   A great deal of heterogeneity can be found in the valuation, especially according to type of care provided.   Informal care is found to be a complement and/or a substitute for formal care, depending on the task in question, while at the same time it competes with other time intensive activities for the allocation of time.

The first aim was to measure the effects of mothers' perceived motivation to teach their children to read on the children's emergent literacy skills measured {{at the beginning of}} the preschool year. The second aim was to investigate child-parent reading behaviors in the home as a function of mother's perceived motivation. These two <b>aims</b> <b>were</b> <b>addressed</b> with a sample of 225 Latino children who were enrolled in head start programs and their mothers. The results from the structural equation modeling indicated that mothers who were motivated to teach their children to read provided a richer home literacy environment, which in turn yielded higher emergent literacy skill scores for the children. This study reaffirms the importance of parental and home influences on children's early skill development both in terms of providing print materials and parents' involvement in specific reading-related activities. It also suggests that efforts to involve parents in a meaningful way and helping parents to engage in key reading-related activities at home might increase print access. Finally, this study documented the strong parental aspirations for their children's success, in contrast to some past perceptions that these parents are unconcerned with their children's academic success...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Immunomodulatory {{compounds}} such as thalidomide (THL) and lenalidomide (LEN) represent {{treatment options}} for multiple myeloma. Venous thromboembolism {{is a potential}} complication of immunomodulatory treatment in myeloma patients. The optimal thromboprophylactic strategy to prevent this drug-induced hypercoagulable state is debated. It is {{the aim of this}} study to investigate i) the effect of immunomodulatory treatment on endothelial cell tissue factor (TF) expression and function, ii) the regulation of the observed TF activity, and iii) the modulating effect of low molecular weight heparin and aspirin on TF activity in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: These <b>aims</b> <b>were</b> <b>addressed</b> in an in vitro culture model, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, using TF activity and antigen assays as well flow cytometry, real time PCR and electron microscopy. RESULTS: At THL and LEN concentrations resembling those observed in myeloma patients in vivo and in the presence of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) we observed significantly increased TF activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. Concordant changes were detected for tissue factor mRNA and TF whole cell antigen. Dalteparin and a mixture of monoclonal anti-TF antibodies inhibited TF activity by 100 % and more than 80 % respectively, while aspirin's inhibitory effect was only approximately 30 %. In the presence of TNFα we detected the generation of endothelial cell-derived microparticles which expressed TF activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our in vitro data support the hypothesis that THL and LEN induce a hypercoagulable state through increased endothelial TF expression...|$|E

Few studies have investigated reasons for inadequate protein intake in free-living older adults, or tried to increase protein intake within this population. Therefore {{the aim of this}} research was to investigate potential facilitators, barriers, and practical solutions to increasing protein consumption in older adults. These <b>aims</b> <b>were</b> <b>addressed</b> using a number of different research methodologies. Numerous facilitators and barriers to consumption of high-protein foods were identified using focus groups with free-living older adults. A questionnaire was designed to determine the relevant importance of facilitators and barriers identified in the focus groups in relation to frequency of consumption of high-protein foods. Based on the results of these studies and previous research, three factors were selected for further investigation in relation to protein consumption in older adults. These were; taste, texture, and knowledge and beliefs about protein. Taste was investigated by comparing the effects of seasonings and sauces added to meals on protein intake. Texture was investigated by manipulating the texture of meat and comparing the effects of perceived texture of meat on protein intake. Knowledge and beliefs about protein were investigated using an independent groups pretest - posttest design in which the effects of newsletters containing protein information on knowledge and beliefs about protein and protein intake was compared between groups.

Hence, {{the aims of the}} international RISKGOV project were: 1) to improve our understanding of environmental {{risk governance}} and its challenges in the Baltic Sea; 2) to suggest possible avenues for improvement. These <b>aims</b> <b>were</b> <b>addressed</b> by integrating social and natural science approaches on five strategically selected environmental risks (eutrophication, overfishing, invasive species, chemical pollution and oil discharges). The findings, recommendations and dissemination products of RISKGOV are described in detail in the Final report ([URL] Researchers from Södertörn University were involved in all case studies and cross-case comparisons. In summary, RISKGOV concludes {{that it is necessary to}} improve the robustness and responsiveness of governance practices to achieve sustainable ecosystem management. Specifically, RISKGOV recommends that: (i) Governance structures need to move towards more reflexive governance by improving regulatory coordination, cross sector collaboration, and interaction space for reflexivity. This is, for example, exemplified by increased interactions between HELCOM and the EU aiming at the combination of mandatory regulation and voluntary agreements; (ii) Assessment-management interactions require improvements e. g. relating to the regional and interdisciplinary knowledge-base, stakeholder participation and coping with scientific uncertainty and disagreement; (iii) Stakeholder participation and communication require improvements in terms of a more integrated system of stakeholder input possibly via an expansion of HELCOM’s stakeholder involvement policy and enhanced efforts to communicate environmental issues to the general public. Implications of these general recommendations for specific actors and stakeholders were analysed and developed through thematic roundtable discussions.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{descriptive study}} described the prodromal symptoms of older individuals, age 65 and above, experiencing {{acute coronary syndrome}} (ACS). Review of the literature establishes that older adults experiencing precursor symptoms of ACS are a high-risk group, one that experiences disparities in hospital emergency departments (EDs) and decreased ACS survival. Identification of early symptoms predictive of ACS may influence a patient's willingness to seek medical treatment and necessitate early, accurate diagnosis and treatment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe older individual's prodromal symptoms patterns and symptom experiences including perceptions, interpretations, and treatment seeking decisions. This study compared and contrasted symptom patterns of ACS among groups of older adult participants, age 65 + based upon age, gender, and other demographic characteristics (previous myocardial infarction, race, ethnicity, regular exercise, insurance, and comorbidity). Three specific <b>aims</b> <b>were</b> <b>addressed</b> in this study. Specific Aim 1 Explore the prodromal symptom patterns as perceived by the older individual encountering ACS. Specific Aim 2 Explore the older individual's interpretation of the prodromal symptom patterns encountering ACS. Specific Aim 3 Explore the treatment decision making processes used by older individuals when experiencing and interpreting prodromal symptom patterns in ACS. Participants included patients newly diagnosed with ACS and ≥ 65 years of age. For the qualitative description, participants (n= 20) were recruited and a chart audit was conducted. Demographic information and data were obtained from the admitting ED history and physical, and discharge summary. Additionally, face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with each participant. Content and matrix analyses were used to address the study aims.

40|$|Researchers and {{the general}} public alike {{continue}} to debate ‘which is the smarter sex?’ Research to date suggests that males outperform females, females outperform males, while others find no differences in mean or variance. These inconsistent results are thought to occur for two reasons. First, studies rely on opportunity samples rather than samples that represent the general population. Second, researchers have not availed themselves of advances in psychometrics that allow for identification of bias in test items and the reliable evaluation of group differences. This dissertation addresses these two identified needs in the literature. Using a large representative U. K. sample, 926 seven to 18 year olds were assessed with the Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices Plus (SPM+), a measure considered {{to be one of the}} best measures of general intelligence. In assessing a one-factor model of general intelligence, four research <b>aims</b> <b>were</b> <b>addressed.</b> First, confirmatory factor analyses and assessment of measurement invariance revealed that the SPM+ is not biased to either sex. Second, multiple group confirmatory factor analyses revealed there to be no significant differences between males and females in either mean or variance. Third, analyses revealed no significant sex differences in mean or variability in younger or older participants. Finally, method effects of Gestalt and Visuospatial answering strategies explained some of the residual variance in the model. For the overall sample, males were significantly disadvantaged by the visuospatial element of some of the items. For older participants, the influence of the methods effects was equivalent. It can generally be concluded that there are no significant sex differences in mean or variability on the SPM+ suggesting that there is no sex difference in general intelligence. Future research should employ representative samples and robust statistical methodologies to assess sex differences on the Raven’s from a multiple factor perspective...|$|E

Its three <b>aims</b> <b>are</b> to place the Roman temple, amphitheatre and cemetery at Marcham / Frilford {{within the context of}} the wider rural landscape, to document the nature of the Romano-British social and economic structure and its relationship to earlier Iron Age systems, and to compare the rural community of the Vale with other communities in the upper Thames Valley. The first <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> <b>addressed</b> by analysing the archaeological data for the neighbourhood of the religious complex at Marcham / Frilford, integrating recent geophysical survey and commercial archaeological evaluations. It is considered whether the site's function was restricted to an extensive religious complex, or whether it can be classed as a small town. Although there is no evidence for urbanism in terms of densely packed buildings, market activities are possible. It is suggested that the cemetery might be a 'managed cemetery'. The second and third <b>aims</b> <b>are</b> <b>addressed</b> by presenting and evaluating the archaeological evidence for the use of the landscape. The development of the Iron Age into the Romano-British landscape is seen through changes in settlement density, structure and form, buildings such as villas, ditched field systems, communication via roads and trackways, increasing population and agricultural intensification. Variations in settlement forms in the Vale of the White Horse are considered within the wider context of settlement in the upper Thames Valley. The Iron Age {{landscape of the}} Vale appears similar to that of the gravel terraces north of the river Thames. In the Roman period it differs from the gravel terraces to the north by becoming a region of villas and local centres, which suggests differences in landholding and in social and economic structures.

40|$|Yersinia ruckeri, a Gram-negative bacteria, is a {{pathogen}} {{which causes}} yersiniosis and significant losses in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the Southern Hemisphere. Currently, Yersinivac-B, prepared from formalin killed whole-cells, is a commercial bacterin-based vaccine manufactured by MSD Animal Health. It is delivered by bath immersion vaccination against Y. ruckeri for most Tasmanian Atlantic salmon. Signifi-cant mortality events may still occur despite vaccination. This thesis {{focused on the}} improvement of yersiniosis vaccine efficacy for Atlantic salmon by using different administrated methods of immersion immunisation. The following <b>aims</b> <b>were</b> <b>addressed</b> in this thesis: •	Evaluate the effects of different inactivation methods of Y. ruckeri on the effica-cy of single dip vaccines including formalin inactivation, ammonium sulphate inactivation, and pH-lysed then formalin treated inactivation. •	Compare hyperosmotic pretreatment with direct immersion in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) by using an ammonium sulphate inactivated Y. ruckeri whole-cell vaccine. •	Investigate the vaccine performance of immersion vaccination with single dip and double dip vaccination of small fish at hatchery stage. In this thesis, three different experiments were carried out to obtain the results. The first experiment where the vaccine efficacy of Atlantic salmon was determined using the relative percent survival (RPS), antibody production levels, and carrier status of Y. ruckeri and gene expression. The results showed that ammonium sulphate was success-fully used for Y. ruckeri inactivation and demonstrated further potential for bacteria inactivation using this method for commercial fish vaccines. Additionally, the serum humoral antibody levels did not correlate with the RPS and were not a good marker of protection of the fish against Y. ruckeri infection. The prevalence of asymptomatic carriers was low. The gene expression was consistent with previous successful use as a biomarker of vaccine success in Atlantic salmon against Y. ruckeri. In the second experiment, the vaccine efficacy was assessed when ammonium sulphate inactivated bacterin was combined with hyperosmotic infiltration in vaccination. The results showed that ammonium sulphate vaccinated fish with hyperosmotic infiltration had significantly better survival than the unvaccinated fish with 25. 6...|$|E

40|$|The {{processes}} of creaming, flocculation and crystallisation are {{important factors in}} the stability and properties of food emulsions. Measurements of the ultrasound velocity and attenuation in an emulsion are used as a non-destructive probe of emulsion behaviour. The present work aims to increase {{the understanding of the}} destabilisation processes themselves and to improve the techniques for interpretation of ultrasound measurements on such systems. These <b>aims</b> <b>were</b> <b>addressed</b> through the computer modelling of creaming, flocculation and crystallisation behaviour, and through the investigation of theories for interpreting ultrasound measurements Two computer models have been developed of creaming in emulsions, both with and without flocculation. One takes a phenomenological approach, and is able to predict macroscopic concentration profiles of emulsions. The other is a small-scale simulation at the level of individual particles. The results of the phenomenological model are in qualitative agreement with experiment al results in the absence of particle interactions The effects of flocculation on creaming behaviour were not however, reproduced by the model. The small -scale simulation demonstrated that a simplified model of flocculation and creaming could result in features in the concentration profiles which are comparable with those observed experimentally. However, some aspects of creaming behaviour were not reproduced by either model. The investigation of theories of ultrasound propagation in emulsions concluded that multiple scattering theory is appropriate for the typical emulsions studied. The complex calculations required by the application of the theory are simplified in some special limits, which are presented. Alternative, practical, techniques are presented for the interpretation of ultrasound measurements. These are based on scattering theory but utilise experimental determination of the scattering properties of the emulsion, so avoiding the difficulties associated with multiple scattering theory calculations. The methods which have been developed are particularly relevant to creaming and crystallisation studies. The effects of particle size variation in emulsions can influence the interpretation of ultrasound measurements, and restrictions are therefore placed on the application of the methods. ...|$|E

The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the feasibility of using the shape of the umbilical flow waveform, obtained clinically with Doppler ultrasound, to monitor the condition growth impaired foetuses. This <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>addressed</b> via the following. 1. Survey the literature to obtain information regarding : a) the foetal blood flow distribution for normal foetuses. b) the effect of placental pathology and maternal hyperoxygenation in compromised foetuses. 2. Model the foetal circulation to investigate the effect, on the umbilical flow waveform, of physiological changes resulting from placental insufficiency. 3. Perform a theoretical and practical assessment of Doppler ultrasound by considering its suitability in monitoring foetal condition, through alterations in the umbilical blood flow waveform shape. 4. Clinically gather and analyse umbilical blood flow waveforms from foetuses currently on a trial to investigate appropriate protocols for the assessment of maternal hyperoxygenation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} carers’ experience of the transition of their relative who has dementia to nursing home care. It is intended that this will provide evidence-based guidance for the development of initiatives to support carers. This <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> <b>addressed</b> by answering the following questions: 1. What are carers’ key influences in making the decision for their relative to move to a long stay setting? Who is involved in making this decision? 2. What are carers’ experiences of making the transition from caring for their relative at home to them being cared for in a long stay setting? 3. How has the family carer’s role changed as a result of their relative’s move to a long stay setting? 4. What types of roles do carers want to have? 5. How can carers be supported in these roles...|$|R
