40|$|This diploma theses {{addresses}} {{the changes in}} the composition of animal lipids during cooling storage and after processing. It was used mincing fish muscle of common carp (Caprinus caprio). After application of selected herbs has been studied their antioxidation effect on the stability of fish lipids after heat - treatment and coooling storage. In total, two analyses were performed. Each analysis consisted of measuring temperature every two to three days for 20 - 23 days. During this period, the effect of oregano (Origanum vulgare), summer savory (Satureja hortensis L.) <b>and</b> greek <b>oregano</b> (Origanum heracleoticum L.) to heat-treated meat in cooling storage was observed {{with the help of the}} TBA value as an indicator of the oxidation level. Fish meat contains a high percentage of water and PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) resulting in a higher level of lipid autooxidation. By applying the herbs into the samples, it is possible to slow down the lipid autooxidation and prolong the storage period. The antioxidative effect of herbs was present in all measuremnts. There were no statictically significant differences between greek <b>oregano</b> <b>and</b> summer savory. Statistically significant effects appear between saummer savory <b>and</b> greek <b>oregano</b> <b>and</b> between <b>oregano</b> <b>and</b> greek <b>oregano.</b> During the whole period of measuring TBA, its values were low. No difference between the samples with the herbs and the standart sample was statistically proven. However, cold storage of fish meat with the help of antioxidative effect of the herbs can be considered as an effective reduction of oxidation in the meat...|$|R
