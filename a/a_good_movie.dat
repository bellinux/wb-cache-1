25|$|On September 19, 2017, {{during the}} {{question}} and answer session after a special screening of Terminator 2: Judgment Day 3D, James Cameron officially announced that Linda Hamilton will return to the series to reprise her role as Sarah Connor. The story treatment was written by James Cameron himself, serving as the outline for the writer's room. Cameron and Miller meet in-person once a week to discuss the film in detail and talk via phone daily to discuss the writing process. Miller stated that the tone will be the same as the first two films. Cameron and Miller jointly acknowledged that the focus of the film is not to create more sequels or generate revenue, but to instead create the proper sequel, with the goal being to just make <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie.</b> However, there is a plan for a trilogy that would conclude the story should this first film prove successful.|$|E
500|$|Nathan Rabin of A.V. Club {{said that}} the film [...] "takes too long to get going to qualify {{unequivocally}} as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie,</b> but when Jovovich finally starts kicking zombified ass, it becomes good enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking to Fox Business Channel, Grae Drake, {{senior editor}} of Rotten Tomatoes, {{expressed}} dismay over the critical reception, stating, [...] "As much as I love and respect our critics at Rotten Tomatoes, I've got to say I am shocked. Listen, the movie’s not perfect but ... I just cannot fathom it. It was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie,</b> you guys." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I'm rather {{proud of}} that film", said Thomas. [...] "Jean Simmons was lovely in it, so was Trevor Howard; it was <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>movie.</b> And Sonia Dresdel was very good value for money; they don't make them like her any more - {{wonderful}} bravura." ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} popular children’s {{characters}} in Germany is called the ‘Sams’. The well-known author Paul Maar wrote the first Sams book in 1973 and helped to transform it into a successful film in 2001, starring the popular German actor Ulrich Noethen as Mr. Taschenbier who has many problems looking after the Sams. A sequel Sams in Gefahr (Sams in Danger) was made in 2003. The books and films about the Sams can be regarded {{as an example of the}} possibilities and limitations of transforming literature into film. Can <b>a</b> <b>good</b> children’s <b>movie</b> live up to the expectations that the readers have of a popular series of books? And what is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> children’s <b>movie...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} rated by Dr. Gore's <b>Movie</b> Reviews as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> softcore <b>movie</b> {{in which the}} scenes with Rebecca Love were exposed. Mitch Lovell of The Video Vacuum praised the acting {{performance}} of both Rebecca Love and Beverly Lynne in his own review of the film.|$|R
500|$|Although Coppola {{enjoyed his}} working {{relationship}} with Lucas, he commented in a July 1988 The New York Times interview with Robert Lindsey that [...] "I think it's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> - it's eccentric, a little wacky, like the Tucker car - but it's not the movie I would have made {{at the height of}} my power." [...] Coppola was able to stoically accept the critical and commercial reaction to Tucker: The Man and His Dream. [...] "Every time in my career I tried to make, dare I say it, an art film, it never did well." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{many critics}} {{identify}} some flaws, often comparing Szwarc negatively to Spielberg, {{they say that}} [...] "this sequel does have some redeeming qualities going for it that make it <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> in its own right". Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw are missed, especially since the teenage characters are labeled [...] "largely annoying 'Afterschool Special' archetypes" [...] who are [...] "irritating and incessantly screaming" [...] and [...] "don't make for very sympathetic victims". Because of its emphasis upon the teenage cast, some critics have compared the film to the popular slasher films that would soon follow. Also comparing the film's [...] "interchangeable teens to slasher films, particularly the Friday the 13th franchise, Muir says that [...] "it feels wrong for a Jaws film to dwell in that shallow domain." [...] However, the critic also commends the teen characters' comradeship and heroism, citing the girl killed when saving Sean from the shark.|$|E
500|$|Mick LaSalle {{from the}} San Francisco Chronicle wrote that [...] "there {{may be more}} {{entertaining}} and less problematic movies, but Confessions of a Dangerous Mind has something about it that hangs in there, working on the mind like a dog gnawing on a table leg. The movie makes a case for itself through sheer oddness and perversity. I'm not sure Confessions is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie,</b> but I am sure I like it." [...] Owen Gleiberman, writing in Entertainment Weekly, observed that [...] "Sam Rockwell is handsome in a rumpled, slightly goofy rabbit-toothed way, but he doesn't really have the look, or aura, of a movie star," [...] Glieberman stated. [...] "He's more like a weirdly sincere space cadet, babbling to himself with puppyish befuddlement, breaking into funky soft dance moves that look as if he's been doing them in his bedroom since he was 8. All of which makes him an inspired choice to play Chuck Barris." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gareth Jones of Dread Central rated it 3/5 {{stars and}} wrote, [...] "Don’t go into It's Alive expecting <b>a</b> {{genuinely}} <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> (let's face it, neither was the original), but do {{expect to be}} entertained." [...] Brian Orndorf of DVD Talk rated it 1.5/5 stars and wrote that the film [...] "lacks suspense or even basic waves of dread".|$|R
5000|$|Marking Nepalese film industry, {{the movie}} has been {{recommended}} as a must watch and is listed in the top 10 nepali movie of all time. [...] Often mentioned in media, {{the movie has}} been noted by media persons as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> literary <b>movie</b> holding the essence of Nepali culture.|$|R
5000|$|Caryn James of The New York Times {{called it}} [...] "empty nostalgia done {{for its own}} sake". [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote the film surprises viewers with its depth and themes, which include racism. [...] TV Guide wrote, [...] "Though they didn't create <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>movie,</b> the filmmakers had their hearts in the right place, and for {{that they should be}} commended." ...|$|R
500|$|The film {{received}} universal acclaim. Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film four stars and wrote, [...] "This {{is not simply}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie.</b> It {{is one of those}} movies that brush away our cautions and win our hearts." [...] He later added it to his Great Movies list, structuring the essay as a letter to his grandchildren about the first time they watched it. Michael Sragow of Rolling Stone called Spielberg [...] "a space age Jean Renoir.... for the first time, [...] has put his breathtaking technical skills at the service of his deepest feelings". Derek Malcolm of The Guardian wrote that [...] "E.T. is a superlative piece of popular cinema ... a dream of childhood, brilliantly orchestrated to involve not only children but anyone able to remember being one". Leonard Maltin would include it in his list of [...] "100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century" [...] as one of only two movies from the 1980s. George Will {{was one of the few}} to pan the film, feeling it spread subversive notions about childhood and science.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Warner Bros. planned {{to produce a}} feature biographical film about actor James Dean, and the studio hired Israel Horovitz to write the script. One of the working titles was James Dean: An Invented Life before it was {{finalized}} as James Dean. When Horovitz wrote the script, he explored the [...] "psychological insight" [...] of Dean by showcasing the abandonment of his father, which became the fulcrum of the storyline. Horovitz recalled, [...] "Why would a father ship his wife's body back on a train with an 8-year-old son, never go to the funeral and never pick the son up again, never bring the son back out to him?" [...] The screenwriter felt {{it was best to}} portray Dean's purported homosexuality by innuendo rather than explicitly. He wanted to focus on the romance between Dean and Pier Angeli and Dean's growth as an actor, and believed that a homosexuality subplot would distract from the storyline. Producer Marvin Worth explained in July 1995, [...] "We'll try to make <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie...</b> not one of rumor and innuendo." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{originally}} {{had a different}} ending to the one later released in America under the title Shades of Fear. Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein requested that the ending be reworked prior to distribution, and Winterson was highly unhappy at being asked to write an additional conclusionary scene. Winterson's preferred ending sees Rex Goodyear burn the painting he believes to be fraudulent, only to discover he actually had the genuine item in his possession all along, and has now destroyed it. This ties in with the major theme of the film in Winterson's eyes, whereby [...] "Duncan, Gabriel, Miss Bead and Miss Quim all find something valuable where they least expected it, Rex Goodyear finds that the things we value are very often worthless." [...] Winterson has called Weinstein [...] "a bully who knows the gentle touch", referring to the new ending as [...] "the most expensive words I will ever write". While she believes that the new ending is satisfying, she feels the film has lost some dimensions which were important to her and concludes: [...] "It is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> {{but it is not}} the movie I thought we could make. [...] I do like Great Moments but there is another film in there somewhere that has got lost." ...|$|E
5000|$|Richard Fleischer {{later wrote}} in his memoirs that [...] "besides being the first CinemaScope picture ever made for under $1 million, it was <b>a</b> damn <b>good</b> <b>movie.</b> Darryl Zanuck, the studio's big boss, was very taken with it, and we - {{producer}} Buddy Adler and I - became sort of heroes. The direct result of this minor triumph was that I was given a five year directing contract and Buddy became Darryl's most favoured producer." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nowrunning wrote [...] "Chanakya" [...] is <b>a</b> {{cracking}} <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> that recalls Sarath's previous {{movies in}} the same genre.While the film caters to the devote fans of Sarath Kumar, it will never fail to please every one". Indiaglitz wrote [...] "Though it is a beaten to blue theme, the rapid narration by Venkatesh makes the movie engrossing". Sify wrote [...] "For those seeking masala entertainment, Chanakya is {{worth the price of}} ticket money".|$|R
5000|$|Comeuppance Reviews called Renegade Force a [...] "brainless {{action at}} its best", stating: [...] "In the end: Rogue Force is 90 minutes of cool FBI\SWAT action. The plot is routine {{but who cares}} when you're having <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time?". <b>Movie</b> Mavs gave the film 3,5 stars out of 4, praised several aspects of the movie and concluding: [...] "Rogue Force is a better than average corrupt police themed adult thriller, with some solid acting." ...|$|R
500|$|McIntee praises Alien as [...] "possibly the {{definitive}} combination of horror thriller with science fiction trappings." [...] He notes, however, {{that it is}} a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. Alien, on the other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster: [...] "It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people trying not to get eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them trying not to get raped by said drooling monstrous animal." [...] Along with Halloween and Friday the 13th (1980), he describes it as a prototype for the slasher film genre: [...] "The reason it's such <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie,</b> and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is {{that it is a}} distillation of everything that scares us in the movies." [...] He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: [...] "Fans of Hitchcockian thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. Science fiction fans love the hard science fiction trappings and hardware. Men love the battle-for-survival element, and women love not being cast as the helpless victim." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{reception}} of the film, however, was much more positive, in particular by reviewers for horror outlets. Michael Gingold of Fangoria gave it two-and-half out of four skulls, while Jonathan Barkan of Bloody Disgusting gave it {{four out of five}} skulls, stating it [...] "isn’t a movie meant to scare or make you think but {{it is one of the}} most entertaining and enjoyable movies of its kind that I’ve seen in years." [...] Scott Weinberg of FEARnet wrote that [...] "aside from some very clunky editorial missteps in the film's second half, there's a good deal of wit, enthusiasm, energy, and amusing attitude to be found in the dumb-yet-self-aware Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," [...] all while noting that he is [...] "not the type to act snobbish around a ridiculous film that obviously knows it's ridiculous." [...] According to Ryan Larson of Shock Till You Drop, the film [...] "is a mixed bag" [...] but [...] "fortunately, the lows don’t appear as often as you would think," [...] and, [...] "if taken at face value, Hansel & Gretel is well worth the view." [...] William Bibbiani of CraveOnline, who criticized the film's inadequately [...] "limp" [...] marketing campaign, found the movie itself [...] "inherently stupid" [...] but in a good way, [...] "played with humor, ultraviolence and anachronistic fetish." [...] Cinema Blend's Sean O'Connell stated that the film is [...] "often mean and nasty, but that's really its saving grace." [...] Peter Paras of E! recommended this [...] "super violent, pretty funny flick" [...] for how it [...] "revels in the mayhem". Tom Russo of The Boston Globe, giving the film three out of five stars, called it a [...] "splattery fanboy fun. Preposterous, clearly, but fun." [...] Jonathon Natsis of Filmink wrote: [...] "Hansel and Gretel is not a 'film'. It's a 'movie', in all its unabashed, excitable glory...big on blood-soaked entertainment and low on pretension." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave it four out of five stars, stating: [...] "This has all the elements of a classic action flick, and it's destined for cult status. Welcome to the most fun movie of 2013." [...] DVD Talk's Jamie S. Rich summed up: [...] "Is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie?</b> Probably not. At least not in any way that is defensible by regular critical standards. Is it a hell of a good time? Absolutely so. Unabashedly so. That's all it wants to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, opinion web blogger Felix Salmon {{wrote that}} Netflix couldn't [...] "afford the content that its {{subscribers}} most want to watch." [...] He cited as evidence the company's {{loss of rights}} to stream several major movies. According to journalist Megan McArdle, the loss of these movies was extremely problematic for the company; specifically, she said that [...] " [...] movie library is no longer actually a good substitute for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> rental place".|$|E
50|$|Lantz {{used his}} TV {{appearances}} on The Woody Woodpecker Show (which began in 1957) {{to demonstrate the}} animation process.

5000|$|Kunal Guha of Yahoo! {{gave the}} movie 3 stars out of 5, {{concluding}} that [...] "Considering {{the amount of}} blood spilled in this film, it could’ve just been called ‘Gangs of Sauce-e-pur’. Hot and sweet and different. ‘Bata deejiyega sabko!’" [...] Roshni Devi of Koimoi gave the movie 3 stars out of 5, saying that [...] "Gangs of Wasseypur is <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> that gets bogged down by the endless characters and length of the movie. If you love those hinterland mafia movies, this is definitely for you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly {{felt it was}} a [...] "B {{movie that}} truly earns its B", and gave it a grading of [...] "B" [...] on an A to F scale. Variety {{contributor}} Joe Leydon said it [...] "Provides enough cheap thrills and modest suspense to shake a few shekels from genre fans before really blasting off as homevid product," [...] and Ryan Stewart of Cinematical said he [...] "can't recommend it as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> on its own merits, stocked as it is with cardboard cutout characters and a barely coherent plot, but it's miles more interesting than the last Alien vs. Predator film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Steve Persall of the St. Petersburg Times graded {{the film}} C- and observed, [...] "The movie is {{actually}} an ugly compilation of clashing cinematic styles occasionally salvaged by musical numbers that essentially {{are part of the}} problem. You can't make <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> about a 1930s composer using a 1970s film conceit while hiring 21st century recording artists to perform Porter's classic songs. A tribute CD, maybe, but not a movie [...] [...] [...] [...] plays like a cabaret review rather than a motion picture, a sublime collection of songs linked by scripted banter barely scratching the surface of its subject. Not delightful, not delicious, just disappointing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film two stars out of four, stating {{that it is}} [...] "neither <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> nor a bad one. It {{features}} actors that we like doing things we wish were more interesting." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, [...] "It is {{possible to have a}} good time at RED, but it is not a very good movie. It doesn't really try to be, and given the present state of the Hollywood economy, this may be a wise choice". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "It's not that it doesn't have effective moments, it's that it doesn't have as many as it thinks it does. The film's inescapable air of glib self-satisfaction is not only largely unearned, it's downright irritating".|$|E
50|$|The {{long history}} of hosting song festivals at Seedrioru started in 1956 and {{features}} choral music and traditional folk dancing from numerous participants from around the world. Currently they are held every 5 years and alternating years with the Estonian Song Festival in Estonia. It is an important cultural component in Estonia's history to sing songs with deep nationalistic meaning {{in order to keep}} the community together. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> reference <b>movie</b> to bring context would be The Singing Revolution produced in 2006.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film three stars {{out of four}} and {{described}} it as [...] "a whimsical comedy depends on the warmth of Segel and Sarandon, the discontent of Helms and Greer, and still more warmth that enters at midpoint with Carol (Rae Dawn Chong), Sarandon's co-worker at the office." [...] He concluded that [...] "it's not <b>a</b> Feel <b>Good</b> <b>Movie,</b> more of <b>a</b> Feel Sorta <b>Good</b> Movie." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film three stars out of four and described it as [...] "funny, touching, and vital", praising the Duplass brothers by saying that [...] "their films hit you where you live." ...|$|R
5000|$|Deadly Blessing {{has been}} poorly {{received}} by critics, and currently holds a 20% 'rotten' rating on movie review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on five reviews. AllMovie called the film ultimately disappointing, but wrote {{that it has}} [...] "enough eccentricities and stylish flourishes to make it worthwhile for fans of vintage horror." [...] Time Out wrote, [...] "Deadly Blessing isn't <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>movie,</b> but it holds out distinct promise that Craven will soon be in the front rank of horror filmmakers", calling it [...] "an excellent example of a mundane project elevated into quite a palatable genre movie by its director." ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{the period}} of filming, Murray {{was in the midst}} of marital {{problems}} and several crew reported his attitude as erratic. Murray had wanted to make the film less of a comedy as to make it more contemplative, against Ramis' own direction to keep it as a comedy. Rather than to handle Murray's constant phone calls, Ramis had Murray work with Rubin in New York City directly to adjust the script to satisfy Murray's requests. Actor Stephen Tobolowsky described the script changes: [...] "When I got the part, it was still kind of a mediocre Bill Murray movie," [...] he said. [...] "You know, Bill Murray, with no consequences, in comic situations ... It wasn’t until we got into the shooting that everything turned on its head. And it became not only <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie,</b> not only a great movie, but a classic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Considered on {{its merits}} as a [...] "flying" [...] film that is [...] "well worth seeing", later {{aviation}} film reviewers likewise bemoaned the [...] "typical story about personal conflict and a woman's faith that infected all too many flying films." [...] Following {{up on the}} art-or-artifice depiction, latter-day reviewer Christopher McQuain states that, [...] "Finding anything of interest in 'Toward the Unknown' depends on whether you consider the film as art or artifact; it is not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie,</b> {{but it is a}} fascinating, revealing one. It is utterly transparent Cold War propaganda, with delighted displays of military aircraft in action, an eager, anxious glimpse forward to the Space Race, and an interest in human-scale affairs so desultory as to make the machines and the ability to build and fly them seem much more important than the complications and consequences of militarism and war waged ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert praised Susan Sarandon's {{performance}} {{in his review}} for the Chicago Sun-Times: [...] "I don't know who else they could have hired to play Annie Savoy, the Sarandon character who pledges her heart and her body to one player a season, but I doubt if the character would have worked without Sarandon's wonderful performance". In his review for Sports Illustrated, Steve Wulf wrote, [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> and a damn good baseball movie". Hal Hinson, in his review for The Washington Post, wrote, [...] "The people associated with Bull Durham know the game ... and the firsthand experience shows in their easy command of the ballplayer's vernacular, in their feel for what goes through a batter's head when he digs in at the plate and in {{their knowledge of the}} secret ceremonies that take place on the mound". Richard Corliss, in his review for Time, wrote, [...] "Costner's surly sexiness finally pays off here; abrading against Sarandon's earth-mama geniality and Robbins' rube egocentricity, Costner strikes sparks".|$|E
5000|$|Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle felt [...] "for all the filmmaker's good intentions, Fast Food Nation isn't <b>a</b> {{particularly}} <b>good</b> <b>movie.</b> It doesn't {{hold together}} or grip {{you the way}} a documentary might have. The people are sketchily drawn - just {{when you start to}} care about one of them, he or she vanishes. To get the consumer-beware message across, much of the dialogue sounds like preaching, an unnatural way to talk in what's billed as entertainment ... But it does get its message across. You're unlikely to leave the theater with a hankering for a fast food patty of any size." ...|$|R
2500|$|Roger Ebert {{liked the}} film and the screenplay, writing, [...] "This is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> small <b>movie,</b> sweet and sentimental, about a kid who never really {{got a chance to}} show his stuff. The best things in it are the most {{unexpected}} things: the portraits of everyday life, of a loving mother, of a brother who loves and resents him, of a kid growing up and tasting fame and leaving everyone standing around at his funeral shocked that his life ended just as it seemed to be beginning." ...|$|R
50|$|A Family Man {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon release with the note <b>a</b> <b>good</b> family oriented <b>movie</b> with strong actors and promising premise but fails {{to raise the}} bar with formulaic writing.
