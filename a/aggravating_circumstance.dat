McCleskey was African American; his victim was white Atlanta Police Officer Frank Schlatt. At the {{sentencing}} hearing, the jury found two aggravating circumstances existed beyond a reasonable doubt: the murder was committed during the course of an armed robbery, and the murder was committed upon a police officer engaged in the performance of his duties. A finding of either <b>aggravating</b> <b>circumstance</b> was sufficient to impose the death penalty. Petitioner did not provide any mitigating circumstances, and the jury recommended the death penalty. The court followed the jury's recommendation and sentenced petitioner to death.|$|E
500|$|By August 20, Vick and {{the other}} three co-defendants agreed to {{separate}} plea bargains for the federal charges. They were expected to each receive federal prison sentences of between one and five years. Four days later, Vick filed plea documents with the federal court. He pleaded guilty to [...] "Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor a Dog in an Animal Fighting Venture". Vick admitted to providing most of the financing for the operation, and to participating directly in several dog fights in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina. He admitted to sharing in the proceeds from these dog fights. He further admitted that he knew his colleagues killed several dogs who did not perform well. He admitted to being involved in the destruction of 6–8 dogs, by hanging or drowning. The [...] "victimization and killing of pit bulls" [...] was considered an <b>aggravating</b> <b>circumstance,</b> allowing prosecutors to exceed the federal sentencing guidelines for the charge. Vick denied placing any side bets on the dogfights. On August 27, U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson accepted Vick's guilty plea, but reminded Vick that he (Hudson) was under no obligation to accept the prosecution's recommendation of a reduced sentence.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Blackmun {{disagreed}} with the Court's conclusion that the judge-only sentencing and appellate definition of [...] "heinous, cruel, or depraved" [...] allowed it to uphold Walton's death sentence. In the Court's view, the state supreme court's definition of the words [...] "heinous, cruel, or depraved" [...] provided [...] "meaningful guidance" [...] to trial judges charged with carrying out sentencing hearings and applying the standards the Arizona Supreme Court had propounded. Justice Blackmun pointed out that [...] "the State Supreme Court's opinions, however, will serve to narrow [...] discretion only if that body of case law articulates a construction of the <b>aggravating</b> <b>circumstance</b> that is coherent and consistent, and that meaningfully limits the range of homicides to which the aggravating factor will apply."

2500|$|Canvassing the Arizona Supreme Court's prior {{decisions}} reviewing {{death sentences}} on appeal, Blackmun concluded that Arizona's definition of [...] "heinous, cruel, or depraved" [...] was so broad {{as to be}} meaningless.

Under Arizona case law, a murder was [...] "heinous" [...] if the murderer used more force than necessary to accomplish the killing, but [...] "cruel" [...] if he used less so that the victim suffers too much before dying. [...] "I {{do not believe that}} an aggravating factor which requires only that the victim be conscious and aware of his danger for some measurable period before the killing occurs can be said to provide a 'principled way to distinguished this case, in which the death penalty was imposed, from the many cases in which it was not.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Controversies {{surrounding}} Georgescu and {{his fellow}} communist literary figures resurfaced in late 2008, when Nicolae Manolescu published the synthesis Istoria critică a literaturii române ("The Critical History of Romanian Literature"). On the other side, the debate involved Dan C. Mihăilescu, who had earlier criticized other intellectuals for upholding a positive image of Georgescu the novelist while [...] "neglect the other bio-bibliographic compartments of a cultural and political doctrinaire", defining it as [...] "an error." [...] Reviewing Manolescu's book for Idei în Dialog magazine, he reproached the author being too lenient on authors whose public image was affected by their association with the communist regime or the communist ideology, and of being too dismissive of Constantin Noica, a far right thinker of the interwar period whom national communists had come to respect. Mihăilescu asked: [...] "Does one wish to turn into alleviating circumstance {{for the likes of}} Petru Dumitriu, Crohmălniceanu, Maria Banuş, Paul Georgescu, Nina Cassian, Gellu Naum or Edgar Papu all that becomes an <b>aggravating</b> <b>circumstance</b> with Noica?" [...] He agreed that Manolescu had a liberty of interpretation, based on his [...] "rationalist, enlightened, playful structure, clearly hostile to nationalist metaphysics", but argued that his pronouncements on Noica were unfair. To Manolescu's claim that [...] "no Romanian intellectual from the communist years was more conflicting than Noica", Dan C. Mihăilescu replied with counterexamples of communist supporters (Georgescu, Crohmălniceanu, Tudor Arghezi, George Călinescu, Geo Dumitrescu and Mihail Sadoveanu).|$|E
