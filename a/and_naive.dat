5|$|In {{light of}} this information, it is {{unlikely}} that Cairano, at his death, was able to pass on an artistic legacy to assure the survival of his studio, despite having trained his son and other co-workers, as well as artists such as Ambrogio Mazzola, whose Madonna and Child, signed and dated 1536 and preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, clearly shows the influence of Cairano's style from thirty years before. This appears to be a nostalgic <b>and</b> <b>naive</b> tribute to a master, who apparently had bequeathed an artistic footprint that his collaborators not only replicated tirelessly but also felt unable to evolve further.|$|E
5|$|Northanger Abbey is a 2007 British {{television}} film adaptation of Jane Austen's eponymous novel. It {{was directed by}} British television director Jon Jones and the screenplay was written by Andrew Davies. Felicity Jones stars as the protagonist Catherine Morland and JJ Feild plays her love interest Henry Tilney. The story unfolds as the teenaged Catherine is invited to Bath to accompany some family friends. There she finds herself the object of Henry Tilney's and John Thorpe's (William Beck) affections. When she is asked to stay at Northanger Abbey, Catherine's youthful <b>and</b> <b>naive</b> imagination takes hold and she begins to confuse real life with the Gothic romance of her favorite novels.|$|E
5|$|The tale shows Potter at {{her best}} in {{depicting}} {{the life of}} the farm and the village of Near Sawrey, but the tale becomes one of something more than just local colour and interest. The archetypical tale upon which Jemima is based– the foolish <b>and</b> <b>naive</b> are rescued from destruction by the loyal and dependable– is transformed in Potter's hands to one in which self-preservation and shrewdness become admirable virtues. Graham Greene thought the sandy-whiskered gentleman a character of ominous gloom and suggested Potter had suffered some sort of mental breakdown, but it is more likely she was simply coming to terms with life on a farm. Wild animals invade the precincts of the domesticated ones, and death is part of farming.|$|E

5|$|Having {{published}} many novels, {{essays and}} short stories, Narayan {{is credited with}} bringing Indian writing {{to the rest of}} the world. While he has been regarded as one of India's greatest writers of the twentieth century, critics have also described his writings with adjectives such as charming, harmless and benign. Narayan has also come in for criticism from later writers, particularly of Indian origin, who have classed his writings as having a pedestrian style with a shallow vocabulary and a narrow vision. According to Shashi Tharoor, Narayan's subjects are similar to those of Jane Austen as they both deal with a very small section of society. However, he adds that while Austen's prose was able to take those subjects beyond ordinariness, Narayan's was not. A similar opinion is held by Shashi Deshpande who characterizes Narayan's writings as pedestrian <b>and</b> <b>naive</b> because of the simplicity of his language and diction, combined with the lack of any complexity in the emotions and behaviours of his characters.|$|E

40|$|Measurements on {{the average}} {{telomere}} lengths of normal human <b>naive</b> <b>and</b> memory T cells suggested that 1) <b>naive</b> <b>and</b> memory human T cells have similar division rates, and 2) {{that the difference between}} <b>naive</b> <b>and</b> memory cells reflects the degree of clonal expansion during normal immune reactions. Here we develop mathematic models describing how the population average of telomere length depends on the cell division rates of <b>naive</b> <b>and</b> memory T cells during clonal expansion and normal renewal. The results show that 1) telomeres shorten with twice the cell division rate, 2) that the conventional approach of estimating telomere length shortening per mean population doubling gives rise to estimates that are 39 % larger than the “true ” loss per cell division, 3) that <b>naive</b> <b>and</b> memory T cells are expected to shorten their telomeres at rates set by the division rate of the naive T cells only, i. e., irrespective of the division rate of memory T cells, 4) that the measured difference in the average telomere length between <b>naive</b> <b>and</b> memory T cells may largely reflect the difference in renewal rates between these subpopulations rather than the clonal expansion, and 5) that full telomerase compensation during clonal expansion is consistent with all data on the shortening of telomere length in, <b>and</b> between, <b>naive</b> <b>and</b> memory T cells. Thus we reconcile the apparent contradictions between the demonstrated difference in division rates between human <b>naive</b> <b>and</b> memory T cells and their similar rates of telomere shortening, and the demonstrated telomere shortening in the presence of telomerase activity.

25|$|A German fMRT-study {{conducted}} by researchers of the Central Institute of Mental Health points towards impairments in social, {{emotional and physical}} aspects of the self-concept and a higher degree in avatar identification in addicted MMORPG players, compared to non-addicted <b>and</b> <b>naive</b> (nonexperienced) people. These findings generally support Davis' cognitive behavioral model of Internet addiction, which postulates that dysfunctional self-related cognitions represent central factors contributing towards the development and maintenance of MMORPG addiction. The high degree of avatar identification found by Leménager et al. in the addicted group of this study indicates that MMORPG playing may represent an attempt to compensate for impairments in self-concept. Psychotherapeutic interventions should therefore focus {{on the development of}} coping strategies for real-life situations in which addicted players tend to experience themselves as incompetent and inferior.|$|E
