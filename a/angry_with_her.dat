60|$|She {{had been}} very <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> him;--and the more so because she had such cause to be <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> herself;--with <b>her</b> own lack of judgment, her own ignorance of the man's character, <b>her</b> own folly <b>with</b> {{reference}} to <b>her</b> daughter.

These things found their explanation in Elizabeth's character, with which Nutty, though he had known her so long, was but imperfectly acquainted. Elizabeth had never been <b>angrier</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> brother, but an innate goodness of heart had prevented her falling upon him before he had had rest and refreshment.|$|R

60|$|I {{was more}} than <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> her--I felt <b>her</b> second flight from me as a downright outrage. In five minutes I had hurried on my clothes and {{was on my way}} to the inn in the Canongate as fast as a horse could draw me.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, however, Aloysius is in {{love with}} Clarissa Whortle, the {{daughter}} of a judge. Sir Trevor has led everyone to believe {{that he is going to}} marry Clarissa to assist Aloysius in evading Clarissa's father. Aloysius, on the other hand, has allowed everyone to believe that he will marry Jane. Before going to the Registrar to be married, Aloysius decides that Clarissa's clothing is too fashionable, so Clarissa borrows Jane's nurse attire.

25|$|Yasuna's unique affliction to {{be unable}} to see males is changed from the manga to the anime. While in the manga Yasuna says she has never once {{been able to see}} males {{completely}} clearly (Hazumu being the only slight exception), Yasuna explains in the anime that she at one time was able to see males, but one day she could not see her father anymore after he got <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> as a child, and it escalated from there to encompass all males. Additionally, in the eleventh anime episode, Yasuna becomes unable to see females as well, though this is later rectified in episode twelve when Yasuna is completely healed and is able to see both males and females. In the anime, Yasuna is shown to be terrified of males, even those in her own class, but in the manga she merely pays very little attention to males around her, even when spoken to directly, or otherwise ignores males completely. In the anime, Yasuna is shown at one time accidentally ignoring her father at the dinner table, but the only time Yasuna is shown speaking to her father in the manga has her smiling to him.|$|E

In 1971, several people in Dhaka including professor Ghyasuddin Ahmed and famous writer Shahidullah Kaiser collected medicine {{and food and}} delivered those to the posts of Sufia Kamal's house, from where the freedom fighters picked those up for their training outpost. From July 1971, she {{used to go to}} the hospital with food and medicine for the injured people of war. At that time there was an acute crisis of food and medicine in the hospital.

Except Abul Barak Alvi, all others died in the hand of the Pakistani Army. The Pakistan Army and their collaborators killed Sufia Kamal's son-in-law, Kahar Chowdhury, because they were very <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> Early December 1971 Shahidullah Kaiser, Munier Chowdhury and Dr. Fazle Rabbi cautioned her to leave Dhaka but they themselves did not leave and got caught and later got killed.|$|E
