5|$|A land {{of green}} fields for crop {{cultivation}} and cattle rearing limits the space {{available for the}} establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the Common <b>Agricultural</b> Policy, which supported <b>agricultural</b> practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common <b>Agricultural</b> Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive <b>agricultural</b> practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving to}} Detroit at age 26, Holmes married into a {{merchant}} family. He later {{got involved in}} both the Detroit Horticultural Society and the Board of Education. In 1849, his background in horticulture and education led him to co-found the Michigan State <b>Agricultural</b> Society, a group dedicated to establishing a state-funded <b>agricultural</b> college in Michigan. Holmes spent {{the next six years}} drafting legislation and gaining support for his cause, and in 1855, the Michigan state governor signed a bill establishing the <b>Agricultural</b> College of the State of Michigan.|$|E
5|$|<b>Agricultural</b> {{losses were}} heavy. In Florida, the second-largest {{producer}} of oranges in the world, {{damage to the}} citrus crop was estimated at $200million, and caused a 50% increase {{in the price of}} grapefruit juice. Charley, along with the other storms that hit Florida during 2004, caused a total <b>agricultural</b> loss of $2.2billion. Other crops, nurseries, buildings, and <b>agricultural</b> equipment also suffered.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to better {{conditions}} for the farmer (by which Tillman always meant white males only), in 1884 he founded the Edgefield <b>Agricultural</b> Club. It died for lack of members. Undeterred, Tillman tried again in January 1885, beginning the Edgefield County <b>Agricultural</b> Society. Its membership also dwindled, but Tillman was elected one of three delegates to the August joint meeting of the state Grange and the state <b>Agricultural</b> and Mechanical Society at Bennettsville, and was invited {{to be one of}} the speakers.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the land}} {{near the mouth of}} Mahoning Creek is developed. A strip of land {{crossing}} the watershed in its central section is also developed. The southernmost part of the watershed is largely <b>agricultural</b> land.

The fastest development in Montour County is occurring in the watershed of the creek.|$|E
5|$|Neither did Wetherby {{ignore the}} needs of agriculture. Under his Green Pastures Program, {{measures}} were enacted to diversify crop production, improve beef production, and encourage soil conservation. He secured federal flood control programs for the watersheds of the Salt, Licking, Green, and Kentucky Rivers, saving valuable farmland. In 1952, Wetherby organized an <b>agricultural</b> council to consolidate {{the work of the}} state's <b>agricultural</b> bureaucracy. He oversaw completion of the state fairgrounds in Louisville, a project begun under Clements, to better display the state's <b>agricultural</b> products.|$|E
5|$|The Tories promised {{changes in}} <b>agricultural</b> policies. Many Canadian farmers {{were unable to}} find buyers for their wheat; the PC party promised generous cash {{advances}} on unsold wheat and promised a protectionist policy regarding foreign <b>agricultural</b> products. The Liberals argued that such tariffs were not worth the loss of bargaining position in efforts to seek foreign markets for Canadian <b>agricultural</b> products.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{processes that}} have allowed <b>agricultural</b> crops to be cultivated and eaten well beyond their centers of origin {{continues in the}} present through globalization.

Welsh beef has a European Union Protected Geographical Indicator, so it must be wholly reared and slaughtered in Wales.|$|E

25|$|Industrial goods used in <b>agricultural</b> {{production}} {{were sold}} to <b>agricultural</b> units in the 1980s. Local cooperatives or state supply and marketing bureaus sold most <b>agricultural</b> producer goods, including chemical fertilizers and insecticides, to households at set prices. The state also offered preferential prices for <b>agricultural</b> inputs to grain farmers to encourage grain production. Households were permitted to purchase <b>agricultural</b> machinery and vehicles to transport goods to market. In {{order to ensure that}} rural units could cover the costs of the increasing quantities of industrial inputs required for higher yields, the government periodically reduced the prices of the industrial goods sold to farmers, while raising the procurement prices for <b>agricultural</b> products. In the mid-1980s, however, the price gap between <b>agricultural</b> and industrial products was widening to the disadvantage of farmers.|$|E
