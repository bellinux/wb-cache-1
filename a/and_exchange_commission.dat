5|$|Schulze, {{with its}} {{signature}} Butternut Bread, eventually became Interstate Bakeries Corporation/Hostess Brands. The business was once Chicago's largest wholesale business entity. Although, according to Form 10-K filings by the Interstate Bakeries Corporation with the United States Securities <b>and</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Commission,</b> the Schulze Baking Company was not formed until 1927, many records contradict this claim. Historical accounts of Chicago claim that Paul Schulze, 1910-11 {{president of the}} National Association of Master Bakers, started the Schulze Baking Company in 1893 with his brothers.

The SEC alleges that Dargey diverted funds from the project for his own personal uses, including the purchase of his Bellevue home and gambling. The project was then transferred to a court-appointed receiver and later stripped of its EB-5 eligibility. In May 2016, the presiding judge approved a plan by two firms to buy out Dargey's share {{of the project and}} restart construction, pending approval from EB-5 investors; in October, the two companies signed an agreement to restart construction and re-brand the project.|$|E
5|$|Enron {{shareholders}} filed a $40 billion lawsuit {{after the}} company's stock price, which achieved {{a high of}} US$90.75 per share in mid-2000, plummeted to less than $1 {{by the end of}} November 2001. The U.S. Securities <b>and</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Commission</b> (SEC) began an investigation, and rival Houston competitor Dynegy offered to purchase the company at a very low price. The deal failed, and on December 2, 2001, Enron filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Enron's $63.4 billion in assets made it the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history until WorldCom's bankruptcy the next year.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, Bush {{established}} Arbusto Energy, a small {{oil exploration}} company, {{although it did}} not begin operations until the following year.

The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc., with Bush becoming a member of HKN's board of directors. Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but a Securities <b>and</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Commission</b> (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush {{had at the time}} of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, KKR {{filed with}} the Securities <b>and</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Commission</b> to raise $1.25 billion by selling an {{ownership}} interest in its management company. The filing came {{less than two weeks}} after the initial public offering of rival private equity firm Blackstone Group. KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened the prospects of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.|$|E

The amendment was passed; however, the financial industry lobbied to have Franken's amendment removed from the final bill. Negotiations between the Senate and House, whose version of financial reform did not include such a provision, resulted in the amendment's being watered down to require only {{a series of studies}} being done upon the issue for two years. After the studies, if the Securities <b>and</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Commission</b> has not implemented another solution to the conflict of interest problem, Franken's solution would go into effect.|$|E
40|$|Insider {{trading is}} one of the {{numerous}} white collar crimes that can contribute to the instability of the economy. Traditionally, the detection of illegal insider trades has been a human-driven process. In this paper, we collect the insider tradings made available by the US Securities <b>and</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Commissions</b> (SEC) through the EDGAR system, with the aim of initiating an automated large-scale and data-driven approach to the problem of identifying illegal insider tradings. The goal of the study is the identification of interesting patterns, which can be indicators of potential anomalies. We use the collected data to construct networks that capture the relationship between trading behaviors of insiders. We explore different ways of building networks from insider trading data, and argue for a need of a structure that is capable of capturing higher order relationships among traders. Our results suggest the discovery of interesting patterns. Comment: 9 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

5|$|Andersen's {{auditors}} were {{pressured by}} Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges {{from the special}} purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a write-off, where {{the value of the}} entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of hiring a new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities <b>and</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Commission</b> (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.|$|E

The {{value of the}} stock {{continued}} to grow steadily and by 1996, shares were trading at $2,300 per share; and hitting as high as $3,600 a share in 2003. Though not required to provide U.S. Securities <b>and</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Commission</b> (SEC) filings, the company does distribute similar-style reports to its shareholders annually, and in the 1930s and 40s, its annual earnings were reported in the Christian Science Monitor. In 1936, the company reported an net income of $195,077, up nearly $10,000 from its 1935 earnings of $185,320. As the company grew, so did its earnings. In 2001, the company reported sales of $91.4 million, giving it a net profit of $4.6 million. Sales began declining, and by 2007, they were down to $44,800,000.|$|E
2500|$|Japan's naked {{shorting}} ban {{started on}} November 4, 2008, and was originally scheduled to run until July 2009, but was extended through October of that year.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence on}} market surveillance from <b>exchanges</b> <b>and</b> securities <b>commissions</b> from twenty-five jurisdictions in North, Central and South America, Western and Eastern Europe, Africa, <b>and</b> Asia. <b>Exchanges</b> as SROs {{engage in a}} greater range of single-market surveillance of market manipulative practices than securities commissions, but the scope of cross-market surveillance activity is very similar among <b>exchanges</b> <b>and</b> securities <b>commissions.</b> Cross-market surveillance is more effective with information-sharing arrangements, and securities commissions {{are more likely to}} engage in information sharing than exchanges are. Relative to the scope of single-market surveillance, the scope of cross-market surveillance shows a stronger positive association with trading velocity, the number of listed companies, and market capitalization. The data also indicate that as at 2005, there is ample scope for jurisdictions to expand their cross-market surveillance and thereby stimulate investor confidence and trading activity.

40|$|What do {{we mean by}} institutions? The {{generality}} of {{the word}} cries out for a defi-nition. But I {{am not going to}} attempt it. A narrow interpretation would consist of only specific legal bodies or procedural mechanisms. Examples include regulatory agencies, such as securities <b>and</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>commissions,</b> standards-setting bodies (e. g., for accounting), and what are sometimes called “commitment devices ” (cur-rency boards (CBs), guarantees of central bank independence, balanced budget amendments, the Stability and Growth Pact, etc.). A broad definition would include everything about a society that is more detailed than the basic theoretical model in a graduate economics textbook: from the existence of efficiency wages and a six-month gold futures market, to culture. The notion of institutional qual-ity that has become common in the growth literature lies at an intermediate level of generality, and pertains to property rights and rule of law. I am happy to accept that usage. But, before I turn to it, I want to flag the wide variety of issues that could be termed institutional, and to observe that they may not necessarily all be correlated. For example, democracy is on many people’s list. But the commitment devices I named (currency boards, independent central banks, stability pact), ar...|$|R
