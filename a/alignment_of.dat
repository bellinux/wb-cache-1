5|$|The current <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> PA378 {{was first}} {{constructed}} from West Broad Street in Bethlehem {{to the current}} interchange with the Lehigh Valley Thruway. As part of the Interstate Highway System, the Lehigh Valley Thruway was cosigned as the <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> I-78. Upon completion of the freeway in 1968, the new highway was designated I-378, a spur off of I-78. However, in1970, as I-78 was realigned to a new bypass {{to the south of}} Bethlehem, I-378 was decommissioned and replaced with the <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> PA378 the following year.|$|E
5|$|A {{road in the}} {{location}} of PA284 first shows on maps as early as 1873. PA284 was first designated along its current alignment during the 1928 renumbering of state highways in Pennsylvania. The designation was done as a spur to the <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> PA84, which was designated from Piatt Township to the New York state line. The entire <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> PA284 was paved by the Pennsylvania Department of Highways in 1932, including the bridge over Flooks Run and Blacks Creek. However, the alignment has remained relatively unchanged since. In 1961, with the designation of Interstate 84, the <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> PA84 was re-designated as PA287 to avoid duplication.|$|E

5|$|By1932, US72 and US78 {{switched}} {{routes in}} Mississippi, with the present-day <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> MS172 again {{becoming part of}} US72 as initially planned in1926. In1935, the road was paved {{to the east of}} Iuka. The paved portion was extended slightly west of Iuka in1936 and further west by1938. By1939, the section of US72 that would be redesignated as MS172 was fully paved. In1986, US72 was moved to a new divided highway alignment to the south through Tishomingo County. By1998, MS172 was marked on the former two-lane <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> US72 in Tishomingo County.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 renumbering, NY30 {{was largely}} {{assigned}} {{to its current}} alignment between the Hancock hamlet of East Branch and Wells, where it terminated at NY8. Past Wells, the modern <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> NY30 was designated as NY8 to Spectator and as NY10 north to the Canada–US border. NY10 was truncated southward to NY8 in Arietta , at which time NY30 was extended north to Quebec along the former <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> NY10.|$|E

5|$|New Jersey Route 163 {{originated}} as an <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> U.S. Route 46 (co-signed with New Jersey State Highway Route 6). The <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> 6 and 46 {{went along}} the <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> the original State Highway Route 5 {{from the early}} 1920s, stretching from Newark to the bridge over the Delaware River at Delaware. The route was decommissioned when the 1927 renumbering occurred. After that renumbering, the route became State Highway Route 6, a co-designation to U.S. Route 46, which had been assigned the prior year. The two highway designations remained intact until the 1953 renumbering, when Route 6 was decommissioned in favor of using the U.S. 46 designation. U.S. Route 46 was realigned once again when the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge opened in 1953, when the <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> the highway was changed to head along former State Highway Route 8 (mostly New Jersey Route 94), where it ended at U.S. Route 611 and NJ 94, where its current terminus is located. After the realigning of the Delaware Bridge alignment, the route was renumbered to New Jersey Route 163. Two years later, the Delaware Bridge was swept away in floods caused by Hurricane Connie and Diane in 1955, which took out several other bridges over the Delaware.|$|E
5|$|SR-103 was {{originally}} on an <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> Harrison Street {{in the city}} of Ogden. Between 1964 and 1965, the state of Utah and the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) decommissioned the <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> SR-103 on Harrison Street, renumbering the portion of Harrison Street as SR-203. The SR-103 designation was soon rewritten in the Utah Code as an access road to Hill Air Force Base on April 19, 1965.|$|E
5|$|The <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> today’s Route 124 {{was first}} {{designated}} {{as a part of}} pre-1927 Route 5 in 1916, a route that was to run from Delaware, Warren County to Newark. In 1927, this portion of the route became a part of Route 24, a route that was to run from Phillipsburg to Newark. A freeway, which is the current <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> Route 24, was proposed for this portion of the route in the 1950s that was approved in 1960. Route 24 was moved to the new freeway between the John F. Kennedy Parkway on the Millburn/Summit border and Interstate 78 (I-78) in 1972, with Route 124 being designated along the former <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> Route 24 east of this point. In 1992, the Route 24 freeway was completed between I-287 in Hanover Township and the John F. Kennedy Parkway. As a result, Route 124 was extended west along the former Route 24 to U.S. Route 202 in Morristown.|$|E

5|$|Through Preston Park, Route370 intersects {{with an old}} <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> itself {{twice before}} coming to the main {{intersection}} in town, the northern terminus of Route247 (Creamton Drive) and its continuation Rabbit Run Road. The road turns northeastward and passes several residences before intersecting with Shehawken Road, where the road becomes mainly wooded once again. The route parallels an <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> former State Route570 and the former Ontario and Western Railroad into Buckingham Township, where the route enters the hamlet of Starlight. In Starlight, Route370 passes the former Ontario and Western station and turns eastward once the old <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> Route570 merges in. After passing a pond, the highway leaves Starlight and continues northeastward in dense forestry. A short while later, the route turns northward and weaves to an intersection with Route191 (the Hancock Highway) in Buckingham Township. This serves as the northern terminus of Route370.|$|E

The old <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> State Route 237 passes a pond, as the highway pulls away from the river and train tracks. The highway intersects with Township Road 413, which serves access to Hirsh Pond, located to the north. The route begins to head through larger clearings as it continues southeast. At an intersection with German Hill Road, the highway makes a shot to the east, passing through some woods. After the woods, the old <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> State Route 237 ends at an intersection with State Route 434. This was once an intersection with State Route 137.|$|E

5|$|After {{continuing}} into Allegany County, Alt US40 descends Savage Mountain into Frostburg, {{where it}} passes through the town as Main Street. Main Street in Frostburg has the highest traffic density on the route, with an AADT of 15,022. For comparison, the parallel section of I-68 between exits 33 and 34 has an AADT of 20,931. In west Frostburg, the highway intersects MD36, which then follows the same road as Alt US40 for about a mile, separating from Alt US40 in east Frostburg. In central Frostburg, Main Street intersects MD936, an old <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> MD36. Continuing eastward from Frostburg, traffic density decreases, to an AADT of 13,585 at the MD55 intersection, staying between 13,000 and 15,000 {{for the remainder of}} the highway. Alt US40 passes through Eckhart Mines, where it intersects MD638, which connects with MD36 north of Frostburg. In the eastern part of Eckhart Mines, the highway intersects MD743, which is an old <b>alignment</b> <b>of</b> US40 which was bypassed by the roadway which became Alt US40.|$|E
