40|$|We {{investigate}} the runaway instability of configurations {{consisting of a}} massive dense but non-self-gravitating thick disc/torus surrounding a massive black hole (MBH). We limit our model parameters to values that result in a self-consistent thick disc around an MBH. We identify, analytically, the index of the angular momentum distribution that will form a thick disc as an initial equilibrium state, and obtain the mass ratio of the disc to the central black hole for which the disc {{is dominated by the}} radiation pressure. In our theoretical framework we find that a self-consistent thick disc with constant <b>angular</b> momentum <b>leads</b> to a runaway instability on a dynamical time-scale. However, even a slight increase of the specific angular momentum outwards has a strong stabilizing effect on the accretion process. Finally, we discuss our results and present possible applications to high-energy emission. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Here {{we present}} a {{systematic}} study of force-free field equation for simple axisymmetric configurations in spherical geometry. The condition of separability of solutions in radial and <b>angular</b> variables <b>leads</b> to two classes of solutions: linear and non-linear force-free fields. We have studied these linear solutions Chandrasekhar (1956) and extended the non-linear solutions given in Low & Lou (1990) to the irreducible rational form n= p/q, which is allowed for all cases of odd p and to cases of q>p for even p. We have further calculated their energies and relative helicities for magnetic field configurations in finite and infinite shell geometries. We demonstrate here a method here {{to be used to}} fit observed magnetograms as well as to provide good exact input fields for testing other numerical codes used in reconstruction on the non-linear force-free fields.

40|$|The {{dynamic model}} of a {{flexible}} satellite with n generalized structural position coordinates requires the solution {{of a set of}} N coupled nonlinear ordinary or partial differential equations. For single composite body satellites, N is equal to (n + 3). For dual-spin systems, N is equal to (n + 9). These equations usually involve time derivatives up to the second order. For large values of n, linearization of the system has so far been the only practicable way of solution. The present study shows a method of avoiding this linearization by reducing the N equations to three or nine nonlinear, coupled, first-order ordinary differential equations involving only the angular velocities of the composite bodies. The solutions for these <b>angular</b> velocities <b>lead</b> to linear equations in the n generalized structural position coordinates, which can then be solved by known methods...|$|R

40|$|We {{analytically}} compute {{time domain}} gravitational waveforms {{produced in the}} final stages of extreme mass ratio inspirals of non-spinning compact objects into supermassive nearly extremal Kerr black holes. Conformal symmetry relates all corotating equatorial orbits in the geodesic approximation to circular orbits through complex conformal transformations. We use this to obtain the time domain Teukolsky perturbations for generic equatorial corotating plunges in closed form. The resulting gravitational waveforms consist of an intermediate polynomial ringdown phase in which the decay rate depends on the impact parameters, followed by an exponential quasi-normal mode decay. The waveform amplitude exhibits critical behavior when the orbital angular momentum tends to a minimal value determined by the innermost stable circular orbit. We show that either near-critical or large <b>angular</b> momentum <b>leads</b> to a significant extension of the LISA observable volume of gravitational wave sources of this kind.
