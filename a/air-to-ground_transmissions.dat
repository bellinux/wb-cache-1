5000|$|Instead, Wellman {{resolved}} {{to make the}} first aerial crossing of the Atlantic Ocean. He had the America enlarged again, now to 345,000 cu ft (9,760 m³). A spark gap radio set was added to the underhanging life boat and operator Jack Irwin used it during the flight, callsign [...] "W", and with the frame of the airship as the antenna. Given the hydrogen used for lifting the craft this was a very dangerous system. The unit made some of the very first <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>transmissions,</b> when the airship's engineer Melvin Vaniman sent one of the first aerial radio transmissions urging the launch boat to [...] "come and get this goddam cat!" [...] - the cat Kiddo who was (at first) not happy about being airborne.|$|E
40|$|A source-coding system {{designed}} for <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>transmissions</b> of video aerial scenes via very noisy channels is analyzed. The images are coded by noise-resistant delta modulation and transmitted together with transform-coded residual {{images of the}} quantizing errors, using the discrete consine transform. For the optimization of the coding parameters, the behaviour of the system without and with channel errors is first estimated based on a simple source model. The results are then experimentally verified by means of real aerial scenes. At an overall bit rate {{in the region of}} 1. 5 bits/picture element the system is found to be especially efficient and the effect of channel errors especially small, even {{in the case of a}} high bit error rate of 10 "-" 2. This leads to an increased reliability in the detection of scene contents. (orig.)

40|$|Aboard every U. S. piloted spacecraft, from Mercury through Apollo, NASA {{installed}} {{tape recorders}} that captured nearly every word spoken by the astronauts during their history-making flights into space. For {{the first time}} ever, NASA has digitally scanned all of the transcripts made from both the onboard tapes and those tape recordings made on the ground from the <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>transmissions</b> and placed them on this two CD-ROM set. Gathered in this special collection are 80 transcripts totaling nearly 45, 000 pages of text that cover every US human spaceflight from the first human Mercury mission through the last lunar landing flight of Apollo 17. Users of this CD will note that the quantity and type of transcripts made for each mission vary. For example, the Mercury flights each had one transcript whereas the Gemini missions produced several. Starting with the Gemini flights, NASA produced a Public Affairs Office (PAO) commentary version, {{as well as at}} least one "technical" air-to-ground transcript version, per mission. Most of the Apollo missions produced four transcripts per flight. These included the onboard voice data recorder transcripts made from the Data Storage Equipment (DSE) on the Command Module (CM), and the Data Storage Electronics Assembly (DSEA) onboard the Lunar Module (LM), in addition to the PAO commentary and air-to-ground technical transcripts. The CD set includes an index listing each transcript file by name. Some of the transcripts include a detailed explanation of their contents and how they were made. Also included in this collection is a listing of all the original air-to-ground audiotapes housed in NASA's archives from which many of these transcripts were made. We hope you find this collection of transcripts interesting and useful...|$|E

Sometimes field performance falls short of design and customer expectations. Recent flight tests conducted by the tri-service Advanced Range Telemetry (ARTM) project confirm that the dominant source of bit errors and short term link failures are “clusters” of severe error burst activity produced by flat fading, dispersive fading and poor antenna patterns on airborne vehicles. This paper introduces the techniques used by ARTM to measure bit error performance of aeronautical telemetry links...|$|R
