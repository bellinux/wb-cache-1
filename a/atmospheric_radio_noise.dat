50|$|While Beverage antennas have {{excellent}} directivity, {{because they are}} close to lossy Earth, they do not produce absolute gain; their gain is typically from −20 to −10 dBi. This is rarely a problem, because the antenna is used at frequencies where there are high levels of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radio</b> <b>noise.</b> At these frequencies the atmospheric noise, and not receiver noise, determines the signal-to-noise ratio, so an inefficient antenna can be used. The antenna is not used as a transmitting antenna, since {{a large portion of}} the drive power is wasted in the terminating resistor. The Beverage antenna is a good receiving antenna because it offers excellent directivity over a broad bandwidth, albeit with relatively large size.|$|E

Results of {{the analysis of the}} measurements are summarized as follows: 1) The daytime noise intensity which is predominant in the tropical region and near South Africa corresponds well to the meteorological situation. 2) <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> intensity measured on board the "SOYA" agrees well with the values predicted on the "Noise Map" prepared by CRPL and with the result of measurement at the fixed stations (Singapore and Pretoria). 3) Characteristics of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> were examined in connection with the solar zenith angle and the latitude. Both the mode of diurnal variation and the relation between absorption and solar zenith angle very distinctly with the latitude. 4) Decrease in the intensity at midnight towards the south from about 32 °S is greater than that of the intensity calculated only from the distance (the so-called unabsorbed field intensity) and smaller than what was predicted on the CRPL 2 ̆ 7 s map. 5) Abnormal enhancement of the radio noise was seen when the ship went under the pouring rain, while the noise fell down to zero level with a flash of lightning, and then it rose exponentially with the time constant of the order of 1 minute. These facts seem to suggest the mechanism how the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> originates in rain falls.

50|$|Thermal noise {{can be made}} lower by cooling the circuits, {{but this}} is only usually {{worthwhile}} on radio telescopes. In other applications the limiting noise source depends on the frequency range in use. At low frequencies (longwave or mediumwave) and at high frequencies (shortwave), interference caused by lightning or by nearby electrical impulses in electrical switches, motors, vehicle ignition circuits, computers, and other man-made sources tends to swamp transmissions with thermal noise. These noises are {{often referred to as}} static. <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>noise</b> is <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> caused by natural atmospheric processes, primarily lightning discharges in thunderstorms. At very high frequency and ultra high frequency these sources can still be important, but at a much lower level, such that thermal noise is usually the limiting factor.

40|$|An <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> burst {{represents}} the radiation received from one complete lightning flash at the frequency {{to which a}} receiver is tuned and within the receiver bandwidth. At tropical latitudes, the principal source of interference in the frequency range from 0. 1 to 10 MHz is the burst form of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radio</b> <b>noise.</b> The structure of a burst shows several approximately rectangular pulses of random amplitude, duration and frequency of recurrence. The influence of the noise on data communication can only be examined when {{the value of the}} number of pulses crossing a certain amplitude threshold per unit time of the noise burst is known. A pulse rate counter designed for this purpose has been used at Bangalore (12 ° 58 ′N, 77 ° 35 ′E) to investigate the pulse characteristics of noise bursts at 3 MHz with a receiver bandwidth of 3. 3 kHz/ 6 d B. The results show that the number of pulses lying in the amplitude range between peak and quasi-peak values of the noise bursts and the burst duration corresponding to these pulses follow log normal distributions. The pulse rates deduced therefrom show certain correlation between the number of pulses and the duration of the noise burst. The results are discussed with a view to furnish necessary information for data communication...|$|E
