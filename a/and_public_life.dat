5|$|According to a 2001 {{report from}} The World Factbook by CIA, about 47% of Nigeria's {{population}} is Muslim, 43% are Christians and 10% adhere to local religions. But in some recent report, the Christian population is now sightly {{larger than the}} Muslim population. An 18 December 2012 report on religion <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>life</b> by the Pew Research Center stated that in 2010, 49.3percent of Nigeria's population was Christian, 48.8percent was Muslim, and 1.9percent were followers of indigenous and other religions, or unaffiliated. Additionally, the 2010s census of Association of Religion Data Archives has reported that 46.5percent {{of the total population}} is Christian, slightly bigger than the Muslim population of 45.5percent, and that 7.7percent are members of other religious groups.|$|E
5|$|Although {{she enjoyed}} {{motherhood}} and assumed {{primary responsibility for}} rearing the children, Stanton found herself unsatisfied and even depressed {{by the lack of}} intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls. Throughout this period of removal from the woman’s movement, Stanton kept in touch with Susan B. Anthony, and writing Anthony’s speeches became one of Stanton’s primary modes of involvement in the movement from afar. Additionally, Stanton often wrote Anthony letters about the difficulties of balancing domestic <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>life,</b> especially in a prejudiced society. As another antidote to the boredom and loneliness, Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and, by 1848, had established ties to similarly minded women in the area. By this time, she was firmly committed to the nascent women's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism.|$|E
5|$|The FBI {{estimates}} that nearly 50,000 members of Tablighi Jamaat {{are active in}} the United States. As of 2008, according to one estimate the organization had a presence in nearly 200 countries and a total following of between 100 and 150 million people. By some measures this made Tablighi Jamaat the largest Muslim movement in the World. The majority of the followers of the Tablighi Jamaat live in South Asia. Another source (Pew Research Center’s Religion <b>and</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Life</b> project) estimates there are between 12 and 80 million adherents, spread across more than 150 countries.|$|E

5|$|Women {{did much}} to {{establish}} the fundamental elements of the social structure of the city, focusing their energies on families, schools, and churches during the city's pioneer days. Many of the organizations which created a modern urban scene were founded and led by middle class women. Through voluntary organizations and club work, they connected their city to national cultural and social trends. By the 1880s women in temperance and suffrage movements shifted the boundaries between private <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>life</b> in Dallas by pushing their way into politics {{in the name of}} social issues.|$|E
5|$|For aristocrats {{to succeed}} in private <b>and</b> <b>public</b> <b>life</b> during the Heian period, it was {{essential}} to be fluent in the composition and appreciation of waka, as well as having thorough knowledge of and ability in music, and calligraphy. Poetry was used in witty conversations, in notes of invitation, thanks or condolence, and for correspondence between friends and lovers. Some of the finest poetry of the Heian period came from the middle-class court society such as ladies in waiting or middle-rank officials. Uta-awase poetry contests, in which poets composed poetry on a given theme to be judged by an individual, were held from 885 onwards, and became a regular activity for Heian courtiers from the 10th century onward. Contest judgments led to works about waka theory and critical studies. Poems from the contents were added to imperial anthologies. Critical theories, and the poems in the anthologies (particularly the Kokinshū), {{became the basis for}} judgments in the contests. Utaawase continued to be held through the late-11th century, as social rather than literary events. Held in opulence in a spirit of friendly rivalry, they included chanters, scribes, consultants, musicians, and an audience. During the Heian period, waka were often collected in large anthologies, such as the Man'yōshū or Kokinshū, or smaller private collections of the works of a single poet. Waka also featured highly in all kinds of literary prose works including monogatari, diaries and historical works. The Tale of Genji alone contains 800 waka.|$|E
