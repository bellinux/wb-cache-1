50|$|In July 1921, at the Pasteur Institute in Lille, Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin {{discovered}} the first <b>anti-tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccine,</b> known as BCG ("Bacille de Calmette et Guérin"). The Opéra de Lille, designed by Lille architect Louis M. Cordonnier, was dedicated in 1923.|$|E
50|$|Stamen Grigorov (Стамен Григоров) (October 27, 1878 - October 27, 1945) was a {{prominent}} Bulgarian physician and microbiologist, who was the creator of <b>anti-tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccine.</b> He discovered the Lactobacillus bulgaricus bacillus, which is the true cause {{for the existence of}} natural yogurt.|$|E
5000|$|Until {{the late}} 1920s, the {{campaign}} to combat tuberculosis in Romania was carried out mainly through non governmental organisations such as the [...] "Society for the prophylaxis of tuberculosis and the aid of poor tuberculosis patients" [...] and the [...] "Society for the combat of tuberculosis in children" [...] which relied on private financial contributions to provide care. In 1926, Ioan Cantacuzino appointed Marius Nasta {{as the head of}} a new section within the Cantacuzino Institute in charge of developing <b>anti-tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccines</b> (see Early career section). That same year, working in close partnership with Albert Calmette's laboratory in Paris, the Cantacuzino team was responsible for the introduction of the BCG vaccine in Romania. As a result of that significant development and within a few years, Romania had the second highest number of vaccinated children in Europe (170,000 in 1930, second only to France with 600,000 vaccinated children). Nasta became a champion for compulsory BCG vaccination of children in Romania. In 1930, Professor Cantacuzino appointed him as the Secretary General of the Society for the Study of Tuberculosis. The latter organised the first national conferences on the subject of tuberculosis and published the [...] "Bulletin of the Society for the Study of Tuberculosis" [...] between 1930 and 1948.|$|R
40|$|A {{mouse model}} of {{spontaneous}} latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) that mimics latent tuberculosis infection in humans is valuable for drug/vaccine {{development and the}} study of tuberculosis. However, most LTBI mouse models require interventions, and a spontaneous LTBI mouse model with a low bacterial load is difficult to establish. In this study, mice were IV-inoculated with 100 CFU Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv, and a persistent LTBI was established with low bacterial loads (0. 5 ~ 1. 5 log 10 CFU in the lung; < 4 log 10 CFU in the spleen). Histopathological changes in the lung, spleen, and liver were mild during the first 20 weeks post-inoculation. The model was used to demonstrate the comparative effects of prophylactic and therapeutic administration of Ganoderma lucidum extract (spores and spores lipid) in preventing H 37 Rv replication in both lung and spleen. H 37 Rv was inhibited with prophylactic use of G. lucidum extract relative to that of the untreated control and therapy groups, and observed in the spleen as early as post-inoculation week 3. H 37 Rv infection in the therapy group was comparable to that of the untreated control mice. No significant mitigation of pathological changes was observed in either the prophylactic or therapeutic groups. Our results suggest that this LTBI model is an efficient means of testing <b>anti-tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccines</b> and drugs. The use of G. lucidum extract prior to M. tuberculosis infection may protect the host against bacterial replication to some extent...|$|R
40|$|The global {{tuberculosis}} {{epidemic is}} {{the most common cause of}} death after infectious disease worldwide. Increasing numbers of infections with multi- and extensively drug-resistant variants of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, resistant even to newly discovered and last resort antibiotics, highlight the urgent need for an efficient vaccine. The protective efficacy to pulmonary tuberculosis in adults of the only currently available vaccine, M. bovis BCG, is unsatisfactory and geographically diverse. More importantly, recent clinical studies on new vaccine candidates did not prove to be better than BCG, yet. Here, we propose and discuss novel strategies to improve efficacy of existing <b>anti-tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Modulation of innate immune responses upon vaccination already provided promising results in animal models of tuberculosis. For instance, neutrophils have been shown to influence vaccine efficacy, both, positively and negatively, and stimulate specific antibody secretion. Modulating immune regulatory properties after vaccination such as induction of different types of innate immune cell death, myeloid-derived suppressor or regulatory T cells, production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 10 may have beneficial effects on protection efficacy. Incorporation of lipid antigens presented via CD 1 molecules to T cells have been discussed as a way to enhance vaccine efficacy. Finally, concepts of dendritic cell-based immunotherapies or training the innate immune memory may be exploitable for future vaccination strategies against tuberculosis. In this review, we put a spotlight on host immune networks as potential targets to boost protection by old and new tuberculosis vaccines...|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{discovery}} of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Dr. Grigorov made a major contribution {{to the creation of}} an <b>anti-tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccine.</b> On 20 December 1906, in Paris in issue No. 104 of the “La Presse Médicale” medical journal, was published his scientific report “The Anti-tuberculosis vaccine”, which informed the scientific community about the results of his research into the application of penicillin fungi for the treatment of tuberculosis. After the publication, the scientific community expressed serious interest in Dr. Grigorov’s vaccine. Through his scientific experiments “in-vitro” and “in-vivo” on lab animals and later on human patients, Dr. Grigorov clearly demonstrated and described the healing effect of penicillin fungi in the treatment of tuberculosis.|$|E
40|$|Although post-translational {{modifications}} of protein antigens {{may be important}} componenets of some B cell epitopes, the determinants of T cell immunity are generally nonmodified peptides. Here we show that methylation of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA) by the bacterium is essential for effective T cell immunity to this antigen in infected healthy humans and in mice. Methylated HBHA provides high levels of protection against M. tuberculosis challenge in mice, whereas nonmethylated HBHA does not. Protective immunity induced by methylated HBHA is comparable to that afforded by vaccination with bacille Calmette et Guérin, the only available <b>anti-tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Thus, post-translational {{modifications of}} proteins may be crucial {{for their ability to}} induce protective T cell-mediated immunity against infectious diseases such as tuberculosis.

40|$|A {{safer and}} more {{effective}} <b>anti-Tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccine</b> is still an urgent need. We probed the effects of monosodium urate crystals (MSU) on innate immunity to improve the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination. Results showed that in vitro MSU cause an enduring macrophage stimulation of the anti-mycobacterial response, measured as intracellular killing, ROS production and phagolysosome maturation. The contribution of MSU to anti-mycobacterial activity was also shown in vivo. Mice vaccinated {{in the presence of}} MSU showed a lower number of BCG in lymph nodes draining the vaccine inoculation site, in comparison to mice vaccinated without MSU. Lastly, we showed that MSU improved the efficacy of BCG vaccination in mice infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), measured in terms of lung and spleen MTB burden. These results demonstrate that the use of MSU as adjuvant may represent a novel strategy to enhance the efficacy of BCG vaccination...|$|E
40|$|Specific {{antituberculous}} resistance {{appears to}} be induced following inoculation of live but not dead BCG. This dependence on BCG viability may explain the diverse responses in terms of protective immunity in clinical trials of BCG conducted worldwide over the last thirty years. In order to dissect out simple parameters which may differentiate a protective from a non-protective response, we have developed a murine in vivo model of experimental BCG infection to study the immune response in draining lymph nodes following footpad inoculation with either live or killed BCG preparations. In this model, live but not heat-killed BCG efficiently migrate to the draining lymph nodes and stimulate the early accumulation of mononuclear cells. In addition, live and heat-killed BCG stimulate different responses {{in terms of the}} level of expression of interferon-gamma, inducible nitric oxide (iNOS), as well as macrophage and dendritic cell markers in the draining lymph nodes. This divergent in vivo response was reproduced in vitro when pure macrophage cultures were infected with BCG and responded differently to live and dead preparations, producing significant levels of TNF and reactive nitrogen intermediates only when infected with live BCG. Taken together, these observations suggest that the differences encountered in vivo {{may be related to the}} ability of live BCG to migrate to local lymph node, where they cause the accumulation of cells expressing protective cytokines and therefore inducing an efficient immune response. These findings may have important implications for the design of new <b>anti-tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 60 years, the Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) {{has been used}} {{worldwide}} to prevent tuberculosis (TB). However, BCG has shown a very variable efficacy in different trials, offering {{a wide range of}} protection in adults against pulmonary TB. One of the most accepted hypotheses to explain these inconsistencies points to the existence of a pre-existing immune response to antigens that are common to environmental sources of mycobacterial antigens and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Specifically, two different mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain this phenomenon: the masking and the blocking effects. According to masking hypothesis, previous sensitization confers some level of protection against TB that masks vaccine’s effects. In turn, the blocking hypothesis postulates that previous immune response prevents vaccine taking of a new TB vaccine. In this work we introduce a series of models to discriminate between masking and blocking mechanisms and address their relative likelihood. We apply our methodology to the data reported by BCG-REVAC clinical trials, which were specifically designed for studying BCG efficacy variability. Our results yield estimates that are consistent with high levels of blocking (41 % in Manaus - 95 % CI [14 – 68]- and 96 % in Salvador - 95 % CI [52 – 100]-). Moreover, we also show that masking does not play any relevant role in modifying vaccine’s efficacy either alone or in addition to blocking. The quantification of these effects around a plausible model constitutes a relevant step towards impact evaluation of novel <b>anti-tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccines,</b> which are susceptible of being affected by similar effects, especially if applied on individuals previously exposed to mycobacterial antigens...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Recently {{our group}} has {{identified}} a novel antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, protein PPE 44, {{belonging to the}} "PPE protein" family. Although its role in infection is largely unknown, PPE 44 -specific immune responses were detected in mice infected with M. tuberculosis; moreover, immunization of mice with PPE 44 subunit vaccines resulted in protective efficacy comparable to the one afforded by BCG against M. tuberculosis (Romano et al., Vaccine 26, 6053 - 6063, 2008). Results In the present paper, we investigated anti-PPE 44 T-lymphocyte responses during human infection by evaluating the frequency of PPE 44 -specific interferon (IFN) -γ-secreting cells by ELISpot and flow cytometry in a small cohort of healthy subjects that had proven positive to PPD (PPD +) in vitro, in patients with active tuberculosis, in subjects vaccinated with BCG and in unvaccinated, PPD - healthy controls. We showed IFN-γ + T cell immune responses to recombinant PPE 44 {{in at least a}} very high proportion of PPD + individuals tested and, to a lower extent, in subjects vaccinated with BCG. By the use of a panel of overlapping synthetic 20 -mer peptides spanning the PPE 44 primary amino acid sequence, we identified a strong CD 4 + T-cell epitope, encompassed by peptide p 1 L (VDFGALPPEVNSARMYGGAG), in the NH 2 -terminus of the PPE 44 molecule at the amino acid position 1 - 20. Conversely, our experiments did not provide evidence of a significant IFN-γ + CD 4 + T cell response to PPE 44 or its immunodominant peptide p 1 L in most (7 out of 8) patients with active TB. Conclusions Our data suggest an important immunological role of PPE 44 and its immunodominant epitope p 1 L that could be useful in the design of <b>anti-tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccines</b> and in the immunological diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{insights}} into the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiologic agent of human tuberculosis, is recognized by cytosolic nucleotide sensors have opened new avenues for rational vaccine design. The only licensed <b>anti-tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccine,</b> Mycobacterium bovis BCG, provides limited protection. A feature of BCG is the partial deletion of the ESX- 1 type VII secretion system, which governs phagosomal rupture and cytosolic pattern recognition, key intracellular phenotypes linked to increased immune signaling. Here, by heterologously expressing the esx- 1 region of Mycobacterium marinum in BCG, we engineered a low-virulence, ESX- 1 -proficient, recombinant BCG (BCG::ESX- 1 (Mmar)) that induces the cGas/STING/TBK 1 /IRF- 3 /type I interferon axis and enhances AIM 2 and NLRP 3 inflammasome activity, resulting in both higher proportions of CD 8 (+) T cell effectors against mycobacterial antigens shared with BCG and polyfunctional CD 4 (+) Th 1 cells specific to ESX- 1 antigens. Importantly, independent mouse vaccination models show that BCG::ESX- 1 (Mmar) confers superior protection relative to parental BCG against challenges with highly virulent M.  tuberculosis...|$|E
40|$|African mine workers {{exposed to}} {{siliceous}} {{dust in the}} metalliferous mines of Northern Rhodesia were tuberculin tested; of 17, 697 tested, 13, 667 were tuberculin positive and 4, 030 negative. The negative reactors were divided at random into two approximately equal groups and 1, 984 were vaccinated with vole bacillus vaccine and 2, 046 were left unvaccinated. These two groups were subsequently followed up and their original radiological categories {{at the time of}} tuberculin testing and vaccination were compared with their radiological categories after varying periods of further dust exposure. The object of the investigation was to ascertain whether or not vaccination with vole bacillus vaccine introduced an acclerating factor in the rate of radiological change in pneumoconiosis. The results of the investigation showed that radiological changes in the two groups were minimal and that there was virtually no difference between them. No accelerated changes were recorded in the negative vaccinated group. This is regarded as evidence that <b>anti-tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccine</b> does not introduce an accelerating factor in pneumoconiosis...|$|E
40|$|The Brazilian <b>anti-tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccine</b> strain Mycobacterium bovis {{bacillus}} CalmetteeGuérin (BCG) BCG Moreau {{is unique}} in having a deletion of 7608 bp (RD 16) that results in the truncation of a putative TetR transcriptional regulator, the ortholog of Mycobacterium tuberculosis rv 3405 c, BCG_M 3439 c. We investigated {{the effect of this}} truncation on the expression of the rv 3406 ortholog (BCG_M 3440), lying 81 bp downstream in the opposite orientation. RT-PCR and western blot experiments show that rv 3406 mRNA and Rv 3406 accumulate in BCG Moreau but not in BCG Pasteur (strain that bears an intact rv 3405 c), suggesting this to be a result of rv 3405 c truncation. Recombinant Rv 3405 c forms a complex with the rv 3405 c-rv 3406 intergenic region, which contains a characteristic transcription factor binding site, showing it to have DNA binding activity. Complementation of M. bovis BCG Moreau with an intact copy of rv 3405 c abolishes Rv 3406 accumulation. These results show that Rv 3405 c is a DNA binding protein that acts as a transcriptional repressor of rv 3406...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of more effective <b>anti-tuberculosis</b> (TB) <b>vaccines</b> would contribute to the global control of TB. Understanding the activated/memory T cell response to mycobacterial infection and identifying immunological correlates of protective immunity will facilitate the design and assessment of new candidate vaccines. Therefore, we investigated the kinetics of the CD 4 + T cell response and IFN-γ production in an intravenous challenge model of Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) before and after DNA immunization. Activated/memory CD 4 + T cells, defined as CD 44 hiCD 45 RBlo, expanded following infection, peaking at 3 – 4 weeks, and decreased as the bacterial load fell. Activated/memory CD 4 + T cells were {{the major source of}} IFN-γ and the level of antigen-specific IFN-γ-secreting lymphocytes, detected by ELISPOT, paralleled the changes in bacterial load. To examine the effects of a DNA vaccine, we immunized mice with a plasmid expressing the mycobacterial secreted antigen 85 B (Ag 85 B). This led to a significant reduction in mycobacteria in the liver, spleen and lung. This protective effect was associated with the rapid emergence of antigen-specific IFN-γ-secreting lymphocytes which were detected earlier, at day 4, and at higher levels than in infected animals immunized with a control vector. This early and increased response of IFN-γ-secreting T cells may serve as a correlate of protective immunity for anti-TB vaccines...|$|R

The recombinant plasmid was sequenced and expressed in E. coli BL 21 (DE 3), and then purified and identified by western blotting. The essential physical-chemical properties of the protein were predicated by bioinformatics tools, including subcellular location, secondary structure, domains, antigenic epitopes, etc. Tertiary structure of the protein based on homology modeling was established, while multi-sequence homological alignment and phylogenetic analysis were proformed. ResultsThe recombinant protein was obtained in soluble fraction from expression system in E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) carrying pET 30 - Rv 3265 c plasmid, and Rv 3265 c gene was expressed correctly. Bioinformatics analysis showed the protein contained no signal peptide and transmembrane helices, located outside of membrane. Secondary structure analysis revealed it contained α-helix, extended strand and random coil, 46. 8 %, 14. 6 %, 38. 6 %, respectively. Furthermore, it possessed six potential antigenic epitopes, one glycosyl transferase domain. A simple three-dimensional model of this protein was constructed by Swiss-model sever.

We showed that BCG and M. tb induced a similar CD 4 (+) T-cell specific TB 10. 4 epitope-pattern, which differed completely from that induced by recombinant TB 10. 4.

A novel therapeutic approach that causes a Th 1 -dominant response under conditions of Th 2 -skewed immunity has been investigated. Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a widely used <b>anti-tuberculosis</b> <b>vaccine</b> that strongly induces a Th 1 -predominant immune response. A potential role for BCG in the treatment of allergic diseases has been reported. In the present study, we investigated whether subcutaneous inoculation with a low dose (1 × 105) of BCG vaccine can attenuate allergic inflammation of the airway in a murine model of asthma. MethodsFemale BALB/c mice were vaccinated on day 0 with a subcutaneous. injection of 1 × 105 CFU of BCG, and sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA, i. p., with alum) on day 7 and 14, respectively. After a 2 -week interval, they were exposed to aerosolized OVA (1 %). In another experiment, BCG-sensitized splenic CD 4 + T cells were adoptively transferred before sensitization. ResultsWe found that BCG-vaccinated mice had fewer eosinophils in BALF and less severe allergic inflammation. The expression of IL- 4 as well as Eotaxin and TARC was down-regulated in the vaccinated mice, while that of both IL- 12 and IFN-γ was up-regulated. Moreover, the transfer of splenic CD 4 + T cells from vaccinated mice into naive mice before OVA-sensitization prevented the development of allergic inflammation. These splenic CD 4 + T cells produced much IFN-γ. ConclusionsThe subcutaneous administration of (low-dose) BCG vaccine suppressed allergic inflammation via Th 1 -skewed immunity and might have clinical applications in immunotherapy for asthma...|$|E
