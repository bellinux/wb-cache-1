5|$|<b>A</b> <b>tropical</b> {{disturbance}} formed east of Chuuk on July 31 {{and gradually}} increased in organization {{over the next}} several days as it moved northwestward. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued <b>a</b> <b>Tropical</b> Cyclone Formation Alert on the system on August 4 and it was designated <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> depression by both the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) later that day. The depression strengthened into <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm on August 5, and the JMA designated it Tropical Storm Saomai.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>tropical</b> wave {{developed}} into Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 3, 115mi (185km/h) east of Dominica. The depression rapidly intensified into <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm, and {{was classified as}} Tropical Storm Klaus only six hours later. Because Klaus was {{in an area of}} weak steering current, it was drifting west-northwestward. On October 5, Klaus briefly intensified into a hurricane, and passed only 12mi (19km) east of Barbuda later that day. By the following day, Klaus had weakened back into <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm. After weakening to <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm, Klaus began to accelerate, while turning westward. Klaus became significantly affected by wind shear, as it weakened to <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> depression to the north of Puerto Rico on October 8. Later that day, deep convection began to re-developed near the low-level circulation of Klaus, and it had re-intensified into <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm. As Klaus tracked northwestward near the Bahamas on October 9, it was absorbed by an area of low pressure, which would eventually develop into Tropical Storm Marco.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dolly caused {{flooding}} throughout Mexico in August1996. The fourth named {{storm and}} third hurricane of the season, Dolly developed from <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> wave to the west-southwest of Jamaica on August19. Initially <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> depression, the system strengthened into <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm about twelve hours later. Dolly headed westward and intensified into a Category1 hurricane late on August20. It then made landfall near Chetumal, Quintana Roo. The system weakened to <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> depression on August21. Later that day or early on August22, Dolly emerged into the Bay of Campeche and quickly re-strengthened into <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm. The storm deepened further and was upgraded to a hurricane again by midday on August23; Dolly simultaneously peaked with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Around that time, it struck between Tuxpan, Veracruz, and Tampico, Tamaulipas. Dolly quickly weakened to <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> depression early on August24, but remained intact while crossing Mexico and dissipated over the eastern Pacific Ocean on August25.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 20 tropical storms, there were several tropical depressions of lesser intensity. The first developed on June 1 in the northwest Caribbean and dissipated a few days later. Another depression developed on July 11 over Panama and also quickly dissipated. <b>A</b> <b>tropical</b> depression developed on July 17 in the northeastern Atlantic west of the Azores, and one ship reported hurricane-force winds; however, there was little evidence that the tropical system was organized, {{so it was not}} classified as <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm. Originally, there was <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm in the database in the Caribbean in the middle of August, but it was downgraded to <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> depression due to lack of any reports of gale-force winds. Similarly, there was <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm in the database in late September, but it was also downgraded to <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> depression due to lack of gale-force winds.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the four}} {{tropical}} depressions this season {{that did not}} become named storms, only Eleven-E threatened land. An area of disturbed weather associated with <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> wave formed into <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> cyclone on September 5. It tracked northwestward, before turning southwest. It weakened into a remnant low on September 8. The remnant turned north and dissipated on September 10 offshore of the Baja California peninsula. The cyclone was nearly <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm when it peaked on September 6. It was forecast to become <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm and pass close to the peninsula. This prompted <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm warning and a hurricane watch. With the weakening of the cyclone the watch and warning were discontinued. No damage or casualties were reported in association with this tropical cyclone.|$|E

About 10hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued another tropical storm warning from Titusville, Florida to Brunswick, Georgia, with <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm watch further south to Sebastian Inlet, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Hermine was {{the eighth}} {{tropical}} cyclone and named storm of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season. Hermine developed from <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> wave {{that emerged from}} the west coast of Africa on September 5. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, and on entering the northwest Caribbean interacted with other weather systems. The resultant system was declared <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> depression on September 17 in the central Gulf of Mexico. The storm meandered north slowly, and after being upgraded to <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm made landfall on Louisiana, where it quickly deteriorated into <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> depression again on September 20.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> cyclone, <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> {{storm warning}} was issued from Port O'Connor, Texas, to Cameron, Louisiana, and <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm watch was posted from Cameron to Intracoastal City, Louisiana; after Humberto became <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm, the watch was upgraded to a warning. Upon reaching hurricane status, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning from High Island, Texas, to Cameron, Louisiana. An inland tropical storm warning was declared for several parishes in southwestern Louisiana. The National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center posted a tornado watch for southwestern coastal parishes.|$|E

5|$|A system {{developed}} {{within a}} convergence zone on January20 near {{the boundary between}} the South-West Indian Ocean and the Australia region. Its circulation became better defined, and MFR initiated advisories on January22. With a ridge to the south, it drifted to the southeast, approaching 90°E, but turning to the southwest before crossing over. On January23, the system intensified into <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> depression. Slowly intensifying, the depression became Tropical Storm Eddy on January24. That day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 11S, and it turned toward the south. After having experienced moderate wind shear, Eddy entered an area of more favorable conditions, and its convection gradually organized. Early on January26, MFR upgraded it to <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> cyclone, later estimating peak winds of 130km/h (80mph). After that time, increasing wind shear weakened Eddy to <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> storm, causing it to curve to the west. By January28, the circulation was exposed from the convection, and Eddy weakened to <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> depression. It turned to the southwest the next day, and dissipated fully on January30.|$|E
5|$|A {{system is}} {{designated}} as <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> depression or a subtropical depression {{when it reaches}} wind speeds above 28knots (50km/h, 32mph). Should <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> depression reach wind speeds of 35knots (65km/h, 40mph) {{then it will be}} classified as a moderate tropical storm and assigned a name by either the Sub Regional Center in Mauritius or Madagascar. No matter how strong a subtropical system is in this basin, it is always designated as a subtropical depression.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>tropical</b> {{depression}} {{developed between}} the Cape Verde islands {{and the west}} coast of Africa on August18, although it was not classified as <b>a</b> <b>tropical</b> cyclone for another week.
