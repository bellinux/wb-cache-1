5|$|Blue whales <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> catch or kill. Their {{speed and}} power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead {{targeted}} sperm and right whales. In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with harpoons specifically designed for catching large whales. The harpoon gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established {{on the coast of}} Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Of {{eukaryotic}} groups, the protists {{are most}} commonly unicellular and microscopic. This {{is a highly}} diverse group of organisms that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> classify. Several algae species are multicellular protists, and slime molds have unique life cycles that involve switching between unicellular, colonial, and multicellular forms. The number of species of protists is unknown since only a small proportion has been identified. Protist diversity is high in oceans, deep sea-vents, river sediment and an acidic river, suggesting that many eukaryotic microbial communities may yet be discovered.|$|E

25|$|In Baltic myth, Saule is the life-affirming sun goddess, whose numinous {{presence}} is signed by a wheel or a rosette. She spins the sunbeams. The Baltic {{connection between the}} sun and spinning {{is as old as}} spindles of the sun-stone, amber, that have been uncovered in burial mounds. Baltic legends as told have absorbed many images from Christianity and Greek myth that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> disentangle.|$|E
25|$|At {{some power}} stations, which are {{equipped}} with plants {{for the removal of}} sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, it is possible to use the cooling tower as a chimney. Such cooling towers can be seen in Germany at the Power Station Staudinger Grosskrotzenburg and at the Power Station Rostock. At power stations that are not equipped for removing sulfur dioxide, such usage of cooling towers could result in serious corrosion problems which <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> prevent.|$|E

25|$|Groups {{also affect}} {{performance}} and productivity. Social facilitation, for example, {{is a tendency}} to work harder and faster in the presence of others. Social facilitation increases the dominant responses likelihood, which tends to improve performance on simple tasks and reduce it on complex tasks. In contrast, social loafing is the tendency of individuals to slack off when working in a group. Social loafing is common when the task is considered unimportant and individual contributions <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> see.|$|E
25|$|Mermaids- Stubborn, yet {{loyal and}} true to their word, mermaids have amazing voices that can hypnotize giants and humans. They <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> strike a deal with, as they {{frequently}} want {{something in return}} and usually take people as hostages to ensure the deal is kept. They {{seem to be able}} to do some magic as well, as they owned a cap able to make humans breathe underwater (similarly to the caps worn by merfolk in faery tales to walk on the shore).|$|E
25|$|While {{it is not}} {{normally}} legal to keep these chameleons, {{it is possible to}} obtain special permission from the South African government to do so. These chameleons are better admired than handled. However, taming is possible through gentle and consistent (almost daily) contact, allowing trust to build up. This is typically achieved through careful and slow hand-based feeding of flies, small spiders, grasshoppers, etc. In cold weather, a sensitively handled B. pumilum commonly becomes eager to perch on a human hand for the warmth. To maintain them out of their natural environment requires advanced skills and is a demanding project; they require the right amount and type of ultraviolet exposure and large supplies of specific types of live food that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> supply. They also require moisture, even just tap water sprayed gently onto the foliage with a hose.|$|E

25|$|Opening {{to freight}} traffic was in stages after {{authorisation}} in 1911 from Shepherdswell to Port Richborough, and from Eastry to Wingham (later renamed Wingham Colliery). The process was casual and without formality, hence exact dates <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> ascertain. Passenger services from Shepherdswell to Wingham started on 16 October 1916. The initial proposal {{was to build}} a line to Canterbury goods yard via Ickham, but authorisation was only granted to build the line {{as far as the}} Wingham parish boundary. (Why this terminus was chosen, near where the direct footpath between Wingham and Ickham crosses the Port Rill, is a puzzle. Perhaps another collery was hoped for.) A major stumbling block to completion was the fact that Canterbury City Council was against a level crossing over the A28 at Sturry Road. The official year of opening of the line between Eastry and Richborough Port was 1925, but this is probably incorrect (see below on Richborough Port). The company's bridge over the River Stour, and hence its traffic over it before then, was illegal, since it had built a fixed-span high-level bridge instead of the low-level swing bridge authorised.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the major}} focuses of {{scholars}} studying Sappho has been to attempt to determine the cultural context in which Sappho's poems were composed and performed. [...] Various cultural contexts and social roles played by Sappho have been suggested, including teacher, cult-leader, and poet performing for a circle of female friends. [...] However, the performance contexts of many of Sappho's fragments <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> determine, and for many more than one possible context is conceivable.|$|E
500|$|The Proto-Germanic or Germanic {{cultures}} on Polish lands developed gradually and in {{a diverse}} way, beginning with the old local Lusatian and Pomeranian stock, influenced and augmented first by La Tène culture and the Celtic people, {{and then by the}} Jastorf culture and its tribes, which settled northwestern Poland beginning in the 4th century BC, and later migrated in the southeastern direction through and past the main stretch of Polish lands (mid-3rd century BC and afterwards). The disappearing Celtic people made a big impact in central Europe and left a lasting legacy. Their advanced culture catalyzed economic and other progress within the contemporary as well as future populations, which had often had little or no ethnic Celtic component. The archeological period is considered [...] "La Tène" [...] until the beginning of the Common Era. The beginnings of the powerful ascent of the Germanic people, who replaced the Celts, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> discern (e.g. to what degree the Pomeranian culture lands became the Przeworsk culture lands by internal evolution, external population influx or just permeation by the new regional cultural trends).|$|E

2500|$|In {{his book}} Flora Brasilica, the Brazilian Botanist Frederico Hoehne {{strongly}} recommended {{the culture of}} [...] Scuticaria species because of their beautiful flowers and interesting vegetation, however, soon later he admits that all species then cultivated by São Paulo Botanic Garden had died {{after two or three}} years. Indeed, he claims that to successfully grow them a special environment needs to be created. These plants <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> maintain under culture. Only recently, with the help of modern technology, timers and foggers that keep the humidity constant, the growers have been finally capable of keeping them out of their natural environment for several years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{viscosity}} of {{the mantle}} {{is important in}} understanding mantle convection, plate tectonics, dynamical processes in Earth, the thermal state and thermal evolution of Earth. However viscosity is difficult to observe because creep experiments of mantle rocks take thousands of years to observe and the ambient temperature and pressure conditions <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> attain for a long enough time. Thus, the observations of postglacial rebound provide a natural experiment to measure mantle rheology. Modelling of glacial isostatic adjustment addresses {{the question of how}} viscosity changes in the radial and lateral directions and whether the flow law is linear, [...] nonlinear, or composite [...] rheology.|$|E
