5|$|As part of {{the first}} {{amendment}} to its articles of agreement in 1969, the IMF developed a new reserve instrument called special drawing rights (SDRs), which could be held by central banks and exchanged <b>among</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> the Fund as an alternative to gold. SDRs entered service in 1970 originally as units of a market basket of sixteen major vehicle currencies of countries whose share of total world exports exceeded 1%. The basket's composition changed over time and presently consists of the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and British pound. Beyond holding them as reserves, nations can denominate transactions <b>among</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> the Fund in SDRs, although the instrument is not a vehicle for trade. In international transactions, the currency basket's portfolio characteristic affords greater stability against the uncertainties inherent with free floating exchange rates. Special drawing rights were originally equivalent to a specified amount of gold, but were not directly redeemable for gold and instead served as a surrogate in obtaining other currencies that could be exchanged for gold. The Fund initially issued 9.5 billion XDR from 1970 to 1972.|$|E
5|$|With the {{progress}} of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the Native Americans were often conquered and displaced. The native population of America declined after Europeans arrived, and for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles. Violence {{was not a significant}} factor in the overall decline among Native Americans, though conflict <b>among</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> with Europeans affected specific tribes and various colonial settlements.|$|E

5|$|Throughout their marriage, George I and Olga were {{a close-knit}} couple, and {{contrary}} to the prevailing custom spent much time with their children, {{who grew up in}} a warm family atmosphere. With age, however, George I argued with his sons and Olga lamented the quarrels that divided the family periodically. In private, Olga and George I conversed in German because it was the only language they both spoke at the time of their marriage. With their offspring, they spoke mainly English, although the children were required to speak Greek <b>among</b> <b>themselves,</b> <b>and</b> Prince Andrew refused to speak anything but Greek to his parents.|$|E
5|$|As {{the relief}} army {{approached}} Tyana, it {{was confronted by}} the Arabs, and in the ensuing battle, the Byzantines were routed. According to Theophanes, the two Byzantine generals quarrelled <b>among</b> <b>themselves,</b> <b>and</b> their attack was disorderly. The Byzantines lost many thousand dead, and the captives also numbered in the thousands. The Arabs captured the Byzantine camp and took all the provisions they had brought along for the beleaguered city, allowing them to continue the siege. The inhabitants of Tyana now despaired of any succour, and as their own supplies dwindled they began negotiations for a surrender. The Arabs promised {{to allow them to}} depart unharmed, and the city capitulated after a siege of nine months (in March according to Michael the Syrian, in May–June according to al-Tabari). Theophanes reports that the Arabs broke their promise and enslaved the entire population, which was deported to the Caliphate, but no other source confirms this. After looting the town, the Arabs razed it to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Bicycle kicks first {{occurred}} in the Pacific ports of Chile and Peru. While their ships were docked, British mariners played football <b>among</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> with locals {{as a form of}} leisure; the sport's practice was embraced at the ports because its simple rules and equipment made it accessible to the general public. Peru's chief seaport of Callao, where football became a working-class sport, is possibly where the bicycle kick originates as news reports and oral traditions indicate that the local Afro-Peruvians performed the bicycle kick or tiro de chalaca ("chalaca shot", as spectators called it in reference to the local demonym) in the late 19th century, during matches with British sailors and railroad employees. Chile's important seaport of Talcahuano also holds a bicycle kick tradition dating to the 1910s, when Ramón Unzaga, a Basque athlete born in Spain and a naturalized Chilean, allegedly invented the manoeuvre locally known as chorera (also alluding the local demonym).|$|E

5|$|In recent decades, {{substantial}} numbers of central European birds have taken to wintering in gardens in Great Britain, and, to a lesser extent, Ireland, where the blackcap was formerly just a summer visitor. Although the British climate is sub-optimal, compensatory factors include the ready availability of food, (particularly from bird tables), a shorter migration distance, and the avoidance of the Alps and the Sahara Desert. These wintering birds come from Germany, and isotope analysis (which enables the wintering location to be determined) showed that the German birds wintering in Britain tend to mate only <b>among</b> <b>themselves,</b> <b>and</b> do not usually interbreed with those wintering in the Mediterranean or western Africa. This is because the British migrants arrive back on the breeding grounds earlier than blackcaps wintering around the Mediterranean, and form pairs before the southern birds arrive. Mixed pairings are also selected against because the hybrid young would migrate in an intermediate direction, which would take them into the Bay of Biscay.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, two {{independent}} efforts have elucidated the molecular {{architecture of the}} 26S proteasome by single particle electron microscopy. More recently, a pseudo-atomic atomic model has been built, again using cryo-EM. In {{the heart of the}} 19S, directly adjacent to the 20S, are the AAA-ATPases (AAA proteins) that assemble to a heterohexameric ring of the order Rpt1/Rpt2/Rpt6/Rpt3/Rpt4/Rpt5. This ring is a trimer of dimers: Rpt1/Rpt2, Rpt6/Rpt3, and Rpt4/Rpt5 dimerize via their N-terminal coiled-coils. These coiled-coils protrude from the hexameric ring. The largest regulatory particle non-ATPases Rpn1 and Rpn2 bind to the tips of Rpt1/2 and Rpt6/3, respectively. The ubiquitin receptor Rpn13 binds to Rpn2 and completes the base cub-complex. The lid covers one half of the AAA-ATPase hexamer (Rpt6/Rpt3/Rpt4) and, unexpectedly, directly contacts the 20S via Rpn6 and to lesser extent Rpn5. The subunits Rpn9, Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn7, Rpn3, and Rpn12, which are structurally related <b>among</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> to subunits of the COP9 complex and eIF3 (hence called PCI subunits) assemble to a horseshoe-like structure enclosing the Rpn8/Rpn11 heterodimer. Rpn11, the deubiquinating enzyme, is placed {{at the mouth of the}} AAA-ATPase hexamer, ideally positioned to remove ubiquitin moieties immediately before translocation of substrates into the 20S. The second ubiquitin receptor identified to date, Rpn10, is positioned at the periphery of the lid, near subunits Rpn8 and Rpn9.|$|E
5|$|In March 746 Ibn Surayj's army {{attacked}} Marv, but was repulsed {{with many}} casualties, and he then made common cause with al-Kirmani—of whose activities between his escape in 744 and this point nothing is known. With Marwan II {{still trying to}} consolidate his own position in Syria and Mesopotamia, Nasr was bereft of any hopes of reinforcement, and the allied armies of Ibn Surayj and al-Kirmani drove him out of Merv {{towards the end of}} 746. Nasr retreated to Nishapur, but within days al-Kirmani and Ibn Surayj fell out <b>among</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> clashed, resulting in the death of Ibn Surayj. Al-Kirmani then destroyed the Tamimi quarters in the city, a shocking act, as dwellings were traditionally considered exempt from warfare in Arab culture. As a result, the Mudari tribes, hitherto reserved towards Nasr, now came over to him. Backed by them, especially the Qaysis settled around Nishapur, Nasr now resolved to take back the capital. During summer 747, Nasr's and al-Kirmani's armies confronted each other before the walls of Marv, occupying two fortified camps and skirmishing with each other for several months. The fighting stopped only when news came of the start of the Hashimi uprising under Abu Muslim.|$|E

5|$|In The Path of the Hobbits, Frodo, Sam and Gollum {{must first}} escape from Osgiliath, {{fighting}} past orcs {{to get to}} the sewers and ensuring that Frodo is not captured by the Nazgûl. However, upon escaping, Gollum decides to betray them and take the Ring back for himself. He tricks Frodo into going on without Sam, but Sam follows them into Shelob's lair. In the lair, Gollum abandons Frodo, and Sam must fight past spiders and orcs, eventually facing Shelob herself, who has attacked Frodo. Sam defeats Shelob, but upon reaching Frodo, he mistakenly believes him to be dead. About to go to Mount Doom on his own, he hides as a group of orcs arrive, and hears them say that Frodo is alive, but unconscious. They take him with them as Sam follows them to the Tower of Cirith Ungol. As Sam is about to enter the Tower, the orcs begin fighting <b>among</b> <b>themselves,</b> <b>and</b> Sam uses the distraction to rescue Frodo. Together, they head to Mount Doom. However, before Frodo can throw the Ring into the lava below, he is attacked by Gollum, who takes the Ring. In the final level, the player controls Frodo as he fights Gollum {{on the edge of the}} precipice. Frodo successfully defeats Gollum, knocking him into the lava and destroying the Ring forever.|$|E
