25|$|The S1 Esprit was {{distinguished}} from later Esprits by its shovel-style front <b>air</b> <b>dam,</b> Fiat X1/9-sourced taillights, absence of body-side ducting, and Wolfrace alloy wheels. Inside the car, the S1 Esprit had a one-piece instrument cluster with green-faced Veglia gauges. The S1 is rare today, mostly due to drivetrain problems.|$|E
25|$|Also {{produced}} by Star Custom Vehicles, {{based on the}} Chevette L hatchback specification, with black, silver and orchid livery, colour impregnated front <b>air</b> <b>dam,</b> flexi rear spoiler, alloy wheels with locking option, head restraints, black four-spoke sport steering wheel, centre console, burled walnut fascia, hinged glove box and door capping, removable tinted glass sun hatch, and two-wave band radio / stereo cassette player with door speakers.|$|E
25|$|January 1978 - Chevette HS three-door {{hatchback}} introduced with 16-valve 2,279 cc slant-four engine, five-speed close-ratio gearbox, uprated {{brakes and}} suspension. The HS also featured a full front <b>air</b> <b>dam,</b> black and tartan interior trim and additional instrumentation. Other {{versions of the}} HS included the HS-X (with black exterior paint and walnut trimmed interior) and the Panther Westwinds (with single-cam turbo), {{both of which were}} made in very small numbers.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the cold}} <b>air</b> <b>damming</b> events which occur east of the Rockies {{continue}} southward {{to the east of}} the Sierra Madre Oriental through the coastal plain of Mexico through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Further funneling of cool air occurs within the Isthmus, which can lead to winds of gale and hurricane-force, referred to as a Tehuantepecer. Other common instances of cold <b>air</b> <b>damming</b> take place on the coastal plain of east-central North America, between the Appalachian Mountains and Atlantic Ocean. [...] In Europe, areas south of the Alps can be prone to cold <b>air</b> <b>damming.</b> [...] In Asia, cold <b>air</b> <b>damming</b> has been documented near Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula.|$|R
50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>dams</b> can {{be nothing}} more than masking or packing tape, flat stock of just about any material, {{anything}} that can resist the vacuum force sufficient to vacuum applied and thus clamping force. Also the <b>air</b> <b>dams</b> may provide a closer seal that light vacuum applied to delicate parts can be used.|$|R

25|$|An AMX Turbo Pace car {{was built}} {{to be one of}} four {{official}} safety cars in the PPG IndyCar World Series for the 1981 auto-racing season. There were two design proposals, both using the Spirit liftback body and designed by Richard A. Teague, AMC's Vice President of Automotive Design. One car was shown by PPG Industries featuring a white/red/blue/black painted production 1979 Spirit AMX with covered headlamps and integrated and smoothed front bumper and <b>air</b> <b>dam</b> unit.|$|E
25|$|The {{front bumper}} {{is the first}} part of the vehicle that the air must flow around. Therefore, it plays a crucial role in {{reducing}} drag. A front <b>air</b> <b>dam</b> is often used which extends from the very front of the vehicle down to the lowest part of the vehicle. This is done to direct airflow around and over the vehicle rather than allowing air to travel under it. Contoured deflectors, or tire spats, are often made as part of the front bumper in order to direct airflow around the tire without having any increase to the outward flow.|$|E
25|$|For the facelifted {{version that}} debuted at the January 2009 North American International Auto Show, Toyota worked to better {{differentiate}} the styling of the hybrid {{away from the}} rest of the Camry range. This was achieved by fitting a distinct front fascia with a large, central <b>air</b> <b>dam,</b> vertically slotted fog lamps, and a single-blade grille. From the rear, the tail lamps abstain from the primarily red lens inserts fitted previously, to predominantly clear lenses, while the interior receives a newly designed fuel economy gauge. The design registrations for the facelifted Camry Hybrid, noting changes made to the original were filed on 19 December 2008 at the US Patent and Trademark Office.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} cold <b>air</b> <b>damming</b> {{east of the}} Cascades in Washington are {{strengthened}} by the bowl or basin-like topography of Eastern Washington. Cold Arctic air flowing south from British Columbia through the Okanogan River valley fills the basin, blocked to the south by the Blue Mountains. Cold <b>air</b> <b>damming</b> causes the cold air to bank up along the eastern Cascade slopes, especially into the lower passes, such as Snoqualmie Pass and Stevens Pass. Milder, Pacific-influenced air moving east over the Cascades is often forced aloft by the cold air in the passes, {{held in place by}} cold <b>air</b> <b>damming</b> east of the Cascades. As a result, the passes often receive more snow than higher areas in the Cascades, which supports skiing at Snoqualmie and Stevens passes.|$|R
50|$|When cold <b>air</b> <b>damming</b> occurs, {{it allows}} for cold air to surge toward the equator in the {{affected}} area. In calm, non-stormy situations, the cold air will advance unhindered until the high-pressure area can no longer exert any influence {{because of a lack}} of size or its leaving the area. The effects of cold <b>air</b> <b>damming</b> become more prominent (and also more complicated) when a storm system interacts with the spreading cold air.|$|R
50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>dams</b> are {{not entirely}} {{required}} {{in the use of}} a Vacuum Table but they can be when the source of vacuum is limited. As a vacuum pump, generally, is designed for high vacuum as opposed to high volume, <b>air</b> <b>dams</b> can be used, again, to increase clamping force. A source for vacuum in some applications may be as simple as a typical shop vac or vacuum cleaner, in light application. Vacuum pumps are the usual vacuum source.|$|R
25|$|Z29 - Spyder {{equipment}} package : BR70-13C steel-belted radial ply blackwall tires (with {{option for}} raised white lettering), sport suspension, black {{front and rear}} bumper rub strips, black headlights frames, black windshield, belt, side and rear window moldings (not available with black exterior), black painted body sill (also not available with black exterior), black door and center pillar louvers, black painted taillight frames, body color front <b>air</b> <b>dam</b> and rear spoiler, Spyder emblems on front facia, rear lock cover and sport steering wheel (horn button insert), black sport mirrors (LH remote, RH manual), rear spoiler and body stripes with Spyder lettering outlined in accent body colour, Spyder hood decal, black painted Rally II wheels with bright trim rings and center caps.|$|E
25|$|A unique Astre {{package was}} offered in 1975. Dubbed the 'Lil Wide Track, {{it was the}} {{creation}} of Jerry Juska of Dymar to help with lackluster Astre sales. Juska took his ideas to Dave Landrith of Motortown Corporation specializing in custom auto work. The package includes a front <b>air</b> <b>dam,</b> rear spoiler, appliance wire mag rims, window louvers, a chrome exhaust tip, and bright stripe decals for the hood, body sides, rear spoiler, door handles, and wheel centers. They assembled a couple of cars in Jan. and Feb. 1975 and took pictures to local Detroit dealers where the package gained acceptance. It added a little over $400 to the price of the Astre but dealers felt the difference in looks was worth the price. Production was later switched from an old warehouse in suburban Detroit to a factory beside the Lordstown Assembly Vega/Astre plant. An estimated 3,000 Lil Wide Track Astres were ordered by dealerships. The package components were later offered as a dealer installed kit.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} compete in {{international}} rallying, the car had to be homologated; for Group 4, the class the HS was {{to compete in}}, this meant building 400 production vehicles for public sale. Vauxhall created a far more powerful Chevette variant by fitting the 2.3litre slant-four engine, using a 16-valve cylinder head which Vauxhall was developing - though the rally cars used the Lotus 16-valve head until a rule change by the FIA banned them in 1978. Fitted with two Stromberg carburettors the engine developed 135 bhp. Suspension and rear axle were from the Opel Kadett C GT/E and the gearbox was a Getrag five-speed. Chevrolet Vega alloy wheels (similar in appearance to the Avon wheels used on the droopsnoot Firenza) were used, {{as well as a}} newly developed glass-reinforced plastic <b>air</b> <b>dam.</b> The result was a very fast and well handling, if rather unrefined, road car. Like the Droopsnoot Firenza, the HS was available only in silver, with red highlighting and a bright red, black and tartan interior; though (partly to help sell unsold vehicles) some cars were repainted in other colours, such the black Mamos Garage HS-X.|$|E
50|$|It also {{received}} a minor facelift in 2010 with slight subtle revisions to its bumper with in-built cornering protectors, <b>air</b> <b>dams</b> and an orange tinted signal on its tail lamps.|$|R
50|$|Such {{carriers}} include springs, electrical batteries, capacitors, pressurized <b>air,</b> <b>dammed</b> water, hydrogen, petroleum, coal, wood, {{and natural}} gas. An energy carrier {{does not produce}} energy; it simply contains energy imbued by another system.|$|R
5000|$|Modifications to engines, {{brakes and}} {{suspension}} are permitted {{and a different}} engine, from the same manufacturer as the body shell, may be utilised. Cars may be fitted with wheel arch flares, front <b>air</b> <b>dams</b> and rear deck spoilers.|$|R
2500|$|Changes in {{standard}} AMX equipment for 1980 were black flares and <b>air</b> <b>dam,</b> standard 14x6-inch [...] "Magnum 500" [...] styled road wheels with the wider aluminum wheels now made optional, and no simulated aluminum dash overlays.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "722 Edition" [...] {{includes}} an engine rated [...] at 6,500rpm and [...] at 4,000rpm. 19-inch light-alloy wheels {{were used to}} reduce unsprung weight, while modifications were also made to the suspension, with a stiffer damper setup and [...] lower ride height introduced for improved handling. Larger [...] diameter front brakes and a revised front <b>air</b> <b>dam</b> and rear diffuser were fitted.|$|E
2500|$|Z02 - Spyder {{appearance}} : Black highlights on front, {{side and}} rear of body headlight openings, parking light openings, windshield, rear window and side window moldings, body sill, door and center pillar louvers, {{rear end panel}} - (bright window moldings with black exterior), black or gold rear accents (taillight blackouts and rear end panel decals), body color front <b>air</b> <b>dam</b> and rear spoiler, Spyder emblems (front facia, rear lock cover and sport steering wheel horn button insert), body side stripes with Spyder lettering in red, white or gold depending on body color, black painted styled-steel wheels with trim rings and center caps, black sport mirrors, special hood decal and rear spoiler decal. For the 1980 model year, Chevrolet combined the Spyder equipment and appearance packages into one Spyder equipment package with an RPO code of Z29 and included newly re-designed bold Spyder side decals and a new front <b>air</b> <b>dam</b> that blends into the front fender wheel openings. [...] Spyder decal color choices (five) were based primarily upon the interior color specified rather than the body color as in previous years.|$|E
25|$|The Corolla sold in Hong Kong {{is made in}} Japan, {{although}} it does vary from the Japanese market model with minor revisions to the front such as the headlamps and <b>air</b> <b>dams.</b> It is available in Luxury and Advantage variants.|$|R
50|$|The Atlas has 110 volt {{outlets in}} the bed. It {{will also have}} {{tailgate}} steps. The front has adjustable <b>air</b> <b>dams.</b> This feature was added to improve fuel efficiency and improves ground clearance when off-road. Active Grille Shutters will also improve fuel efficiency.|$|R
50|$|The cold surges on {{the eastern}} slopes of the Rocky Mountains, Iceland, New Zealand, and eastern Asia differ from the cold <b>air</b> <b>damming</b> east of the Appalachians due to the wider {{mountain}} ranges, sloping terrain, and lack of an eastern body of warm water.|$|R
2500|$|The {{exterior}} {{featured a}} blacked out grille, headlight bezels, rear window molding, door and quarter window frames, rear license plate depression, and wiper arms, a black front <b>air</b> <b>dam,</b> black {{front and rear}} fender flares, dual flat black rear-view mirrors, black rear window louvers, black body side scuff moldings, silver [...] "targa" [...] roof band, contrasting [...] "AMX" [...] decals ahead of the rear wheels, silver slot-styled steel wheels, and body painted bumpers with black rubber guards and scuff moldings.|$|E
2500|$|The {{body of the}} Honda City Turbo {{was made}} sportier by the {{addition}} of a new <b>air</b> <b>dam</b> with fog lights and asymmetrical grille at the front and a small spoiler at the top/rear of the car. Meanwhile, a hump was added to the hood {{to make room for the}} extra equipment of the turbocharged engine. In addition to flared fenders and [...] "Turbo II Intercooler" [...] graphics, the Turbo II also got a bigger bump in the hood, body colored bumpers and a louver ahead of the rear wheel.|$|E
2500|$|At mid-season, a GT package became {{available}} with a front spoiler and flared wheel openings {{as on the}} 1978 AMX. The GT added an aluminum overlay to the instrument panel, was powered by the [...] I6 as standard, and had its own stripe scheme: a wide tape stripe, outlined by a narrow one, ran back from the front fenders and widened aft of the rear quarter windows. The package also included body-color fender flares and front <b>air</b> <b>dam,</b> as well as body-color bumpers, all of which combined to give the GT a modern, aggressive look. Fewer than 3,000 Gremlin GTs were built.|$|E
50|$|Other changes {{included}} 362 mm (14 in) {{ventilated disc}} brakes, the largest {{used in a}} passenger car until the Bentley Continental GT, and 18 in (457 mm) wheels. Visually, the 6.3 had wide flared bumpers, low sills and <b>air</b> <b>dams,</b> and side <b>air</b> vents.|$|R
50|$|The eastern {{slopes and}} {{mountain}} passes can receive significant snowfall. Cold Arctic air can flow south from British Columbia through the Okanogan River valley into the bowl-like basin {{east of the}} Cascades. Cold <b>air</b> <b>damming</b> causes this Arctic air to bank up along the eastern Cascade slopes, especially into the lower passes, such as Snoqualmie Pass and Stevens Pass. The milder, Pacific-influenced air moving east over the Cascades is often forced aloft by the cold air held {{in place in the}} passes due to cold <b>air</b> <b>damming.</b> As a result, the passes often receive more snow than higher areas in the Cascades. This effect makes the relatively low elevation ski resorts at Snoqualmie Pass (about 3000 ft) and Stevens Pass (about 4000 ft) possible.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine is}} a 5.7-litre LS1 V8 pushing out [...] at 5600 rpm and 475 Nm of torque. New badging {{featured}} on the Senator read [...] "260" [...] reflecting the increased power output. The brake {{and some of the}} engine cooling vents located on the front bumper are slightly hidden to keep its luxury well present while viewing the vehicle. Mesh cloth is located at the front <b>air</b> <b>dams.</b> Some of the side skirts front and rear <b>air</b> <b>dams</b> and the lower parts of the exterior mirrors are coloured in a satin finish grey. The rest is finished in the body colour. The famous [...] "Senator" [...] name plates are {{featured on the}} side skirts, rear and {{at the bottom of the}} rear doors.|$|R
2500|$|The {{second half}} {{settled down to}} the top three {{championship}} contenders: Allison, Elliott, and Kulwicki. Around lap 118, rookie Jeff Gordon made a pit stop. The Ray Evernham-led [...] "Rainbow Warriors" [...] crew were still unrefined, and made many mistakes. Evernham himself referred to them as the bumbling [...] "Keystone Kops." [...] The crew accidentally left a roll of duct tape on the hood, and it fell off out on the track. Davey Allison, running second, hit the debris and suffered a damaged front <b>air</b> <b>dam.</b> He lost several positions and {{the handling of the}} car was affected.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989 the K-Jetronic {{system was}} {{replaced}} with a Lotus/Delco multi-point fuel injection (MPFI) system. The engine also received an air-water-air intercooler called a Chargecooler by Lotus. This revised engine {{was known as the}} Type 910S. Power was up to [...] with [...] available on overboost. 0-60mph times dropped to 4.7 seconds and top speed was over [...] The 910S engine went into the new Special Equipment (SE) model, which also received changes to the body, with side skirts parallel to the body, five air ducts in the front <b>air</b> <b>dam,</b> wing mirrors from the Citroën CX and the addition of a rear wing.|$|E
2500|$|It {{featured}} special color-matched fender flares {{and front}} <b>air</b> <b>dam,</b> 'Rally-Tuned' suspension with [...] {{front and rear}} sway bars, high-effort power steering gears, front and rear three-way adjustable [...] "Strider" [...] Gabriel (brand name) shock absorbers, heavy-duty semi-metallic [...] front disk brakes with ribbed 10x1.2-inch (254x30.5mm) rear drum brakes, unique AMX grille, [...] "Turbocast II" [...] 14x7-inch aluminum road wheels with ER60x14 Goodyear [...] "Flexten" [...] GT radial RWL (raised white letter) tires, rear spoiler, special striping package, hood and door decals, console shifted automatic or manual transmission with 'Rallye Gauge' package (total of eight dials including an intake-manifold vacuum gauge), as well as simulated aluminum dash overlays with AMX badge on the glove compartment door.|$|E
50|$|To use {{a vacuum}} table one must place the work upon {{the table and}} use <b>air</b> <b>dams</b> around the work to {{minimize}} the loss of vacuum to atmospheric pressure. This maximizes force to the work in any attitude that the table may be held, in all axis, that the work may be machined or inspected.|$|R
50|$|The 2014 Chevrolet Corvette {{became the}} first vehicle to {{incorporate}} SMA actuators, which replaced heavier motorized actuators to open and close the hatch vent that releases air from the trunk, {{making it easier to}} close. A variety of other applications are also being targeted, including electric generators to generate electricity from exhaust heat and on-demand <b>air</b> <b>dams</b> to optimize aerodynamics at various speeds.|$|R
5000|$|Cold <b>air</b> <b>damming</b> {{typically}} {{happens in}} the mid-latitudes as this region lies within the Westerlies, an area where frontal intrusions are common. When the Arctic oscillation is negative and pressures are higher over the poles, the flow is more meridional, blowing {{from the direction of}} the pole towards the equator, which brings cold air into the mid-latitudes. [...] Cold <b>air</b> <b>damming</b> is observed in the southern hemisphere to the east of the Andes, with cool incursions seen as far equatorward as the 10th parallel south. [...] In the northern hemisphere, common situations occur along the east side of ranges within the Rocky Mountains system over the western portions of the Great Plains, as well as various other mountain ranges (such as the Cascades) along the west coast of the United States. [...] The initial is caused by the poleward portion of a split upper level trough, with the damming preceding the arrival of the more equatorward portion.|$|R
