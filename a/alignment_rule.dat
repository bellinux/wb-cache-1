40|$|Collective {{behavior}} emerging out of self-organization {{is one of}} {{the most}} striking properties of an animal group. Typically, it is hypothesized that each individual in an animal group tends to align its direction of motion with those of its neighbors. Most previous models for collective behavior assume an explicit <b>alignment</b> <b>rule,</b> by which an agent matches its velocity with that of neighbors in a certain neighborhood, to reproduce a collective order pattern by simple interactions. Recent empirical studies, however, suggest that there is no evidence for explicit matching of velocity, and that collective polarization arises from interactions other than those that follow the explicit <b>alignment</b> <b>rule.</b> We here propose a new lattice-based computational model that does not incorporate the explicit <b>alignment</b> <b>rule</b> but is based instead on mutual anticipation and asynchronous updating. Moreover, we show that this model can realize densely collective motion with high polarity. Furthermore, we focus on the behavior of a pair of individuals, and find that the turning response is drastically changed depending on the distance between two individuals rather than the relative heading, and is consistent with the empirical observations. Therefore, the present results suggest that our approach provides an alternative model for collective behavior...|$|E

A given domain is often represented by multiple ontologies, providing overlapping, yet different coverage and possibly differing in their representation of the domain knowledge. There {{is a need for}} creating mappings among such ontologies in order to facilitate knowledge sharing and reuse. Anatomy is central to the biomedical domain and several anatomical ontologies have been created over the past fifteen years. This paper presents some of the techniques we developed for aligning two large anatomical ontologies: the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) and the GALEN Common Reference Model (GALEN). Our approach first consists in aligning concepts across systems based on the lexical resemblance of their names and the structural similarity of their relations to other concepts. In addition, we created complex structural <b>alignment</b> <b>rules</b> for identifying mappings between groups of concepts and concepts that provably cannot have matches in the other system.

Such a motion is not observed for a single SPP, but is a consequence of the collective motion of SPP around the obstacles.

Furthermore, we show that the compelled symmetry-breaking effects {{at or near the}} singularities, as well as the topological connectivity of the swarm in the evolution process, contribute fundamentally to the emergence of the collective behavior; and the elimination or weakening of singularities in the DAR will induce an unexpected sharp transition from coherent movement to isotropic dispersion.

40|$|Multiple flaws are {{frequently}} replaced with simpler flaws {{according to the}} flaw alignment rules {{for the purpose of}} engineering assessment. Such rules typically compare the flaw separation distance with the characteristic dimension, such as flaw length or flaw depth. For configurations involving flaws on parallel offset planes, current ASME Boiler code, Section XI, Article IWA- 3300 suggests a fixed distance of 12. 4 mm between the offset flaw planes as a flaw <b>alignment</b> <b>rule.</b> Recent experimental work of Hasegawa et al [4] showed this criteria is not always conservative for ductile fracture. In this paper the analytical and computational methods are used to derive plastic collapse load for plates with twin non-aligned through-wall flaws. Results show that in a multiple flaw geometry the global plastic collapse load is independent of the flaw separation when horizontal and vertical separations between flaw tips are equal. Such geometries are of most interest, since experimental work shows that flaws in such geometries interact over distances several times larger than the characteristic distance (flaw length or thickness). A criteria for flaw alignment based on the ratio of a local to global limit load is derived. A local limit load is defined as the load to cause collapse of the ligament between the flaw tips. It is shown that the separation between parallel flaws should be {{more than three times the}} flaw length to maintain interaction below 15 per cent and ensure a conservative assessment...|$|E
40|$|From the {{formation}} of animal flocks {{to the emergence of}} coordinate motion in bacterial swarms, at all scales populations of motile organisms display coherent collective motion. This consistent behavior strongly contrasts with the difference in communication abilities between the individuals. Guided by this universal feature, physicists have proposed that solely <b>alignment</b> <b>rules</b> at the individual level could account for the emergence of unidirectional motion at the group level. This hypothesis has been supported by agent-based simulations. However, more complex collective behaviors have been systematically found in experiments including {{the formation}} of vortices, fluctuating swarms, clustering and swirling. All these model systems predominantly rely on actual collisions to display collective motion. As a result, the potential local <b>alignment</b> <b>rules</b> are entangled with more complex, often unknown, interactions. The large-scale behavior of the populations therefore depends on these uncontrolled microscopic couplings. Here, we demonstrate a new phase of active matter. We reveal that dilute populations of millions of colloidal rollers self-organize to achieve coherent motion along a unique direction, with very few density and velocity fluctuations. Identifying the microscopic interactions between the rollers allows a theoretical description of this polar-liquid state. Comparison of the theory with experiment suggests that hydrodynamic interactions promote the emergence of collective motion either {{in the form of a}} single macroscopic flock at low densities, or in that of a homogenous polar phase at higher densities. Furthermore, hydrodynamics protects the polar-liquid state from the giant density fluctuations. Our experiments demonstrate that genuine physical interactions at the individual level are sufficient to set homogeneous active populations into stable directed motion...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explains}} a very well-known feature of Classical Greek syntax {{from the perspective}} of Natural Syntax. Most grammars of Classical Greek state that infinitive clauses could be dependent on both verbs of speaking and thinking in Classical Greek. In contrast, finite dependent clauses could be governed only by verbs of speaking. However, one verb of speaking that regularly governs infinitive clauses is 'say'. In terms of Natural Syntax, infinitive clauses are more natural than finite dependent clauses. The scale > nat (infinitive clause, finite dependent clause) is supported by the criterion of favorable for the speaker and the hearer (criterion A) and the criterion of integration into the clause (criterion D). In addition, verbs of thinking are more natural than verbs of speaking. The scale > nat (verbs of thinking, verbs of speaking) is supported by the criterion of integration into the clause (criterion C), the criterion of frequency (criterion C), and the criterion of favorable for the speaker andthe hearer (criterion A). Natural Syntax predicts that the more natural syntactic variant (i. e., infinitive clauses) associates with more natural parameters (i. e., verbs of thinking) than the less natural syntactic variant (i. e., finite dependent clauses). This type of <b>alignment</b> <b>rule</b> is called parallel alignment. In addition, most of the criteria applied indicate that the verb 'say' is more natural than other verbs of speaking (e. g., it is an enclitic verb). Consequently, it is expected within Natural Syntax that the verb 'say' associates with the more natural syntactic variant (i. e., with infinitive clauses) ...|$|E

Typical scene detection algorithms incorporate time distance in an exceedingly shot similarity metric. within the technique we have a tendency to propose, to beat the problem of getting previous data of the scene period, the shots square measure clustered into teams primarily based solely on their visual similarity and a label is assigned to every shot in line with the cluster that it belongs to.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the phenomenon of}} collective motion in binary mixtures of self-propelled particles. We consider two particle species, each of which consisting of pointlike objects that propel with a velocity of constant magnitude. Within each species, the particles try to achieve polar alignment of their velocity vectors, whereas we analyze the cases of preferred polar, antiparallel, as well as perpendicular alignment between particles of different species. Our {{focus is on the}} effect that the interplay between the two species has on the threshold densities for the onset of collective motion and {{on the nature of the}} solutions above onset. For this purpose, we start from suitable Langevin equations in the particle picture, from which we derive mean field equations of the Fokker-Planck type and finally macroscopic continuum field equations. We perform particle simulations of the Langevin equations, linear stability analyses of the Fokker-Planck and macroscopic continuum equations, and we numerically solve the Fokker-Planck equations. Both, spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous solutions are investigated, where the latter correspond to stripe-like flocks of collectively moving particles. In general, the interaction between the two species reduces the threshold density for the onset of collective motion of each species. However, this interaction also reduces the spatial organization in the stripe-like flocks. The most interesting behavior is found for the case of preferred perpendicular alignment between different species. There, a competition between polar and truly nematic orientational ordering of the velocity vectors takes place within each particle species. Finally, depending on the <b>alignment</b> <b>rule</b> for particles of different species and within certain ranges of particle densities, identical and inverted spatial density profiles can be found for the two particle species.

40|$|Animal groups often exhibit highly coordinated {{collective}} {{motion in}} a variety of situations. For example, bird flocks, schools of fish, a flock of sheep being herded by a dog and highly efficient traffic on an ant trail. Although these phenomena can be observed every day all over the world our knowledge of what rules the individual's in such groups use is very limited. Questions of this type has been studied using so called self-propelled particle (SPP) models, most of which assume that collective motion arises from individuals aligning with their neighbors. Here we introduce and analyze a SPP-model based on attraction alone. We find that it produces all the typical groups seen in alignment-based models and some novel ones. In particular, a group that exhibits collective motion coupled with non-trivial internal dynamics. Groups that have this property are rarely seen in SPP-models and we show that even when a repulsion term is added to the attraction only model such groups are still present. These findings suggest that an interplay between attraction and repulsion may be the main driving force in real flocks and that the <b>alignment</b> <b>rule</b> may be superfluous. We then proceed to model two different experiments using the SPP-model approach. The first is a shepherding algorithm constructed primarily to model experiments where a sheepdog is herding a flock of sheep. We find that in addition to modeling the specific experimental situation well the algorithm has some properties which may make it useful in more general shepherding situations. The second is a traffic model for leaf-cutting ants bridges. Based on earlier experiments a set of traffic rules for ants on a very narrow bridge had been suggested. We show that these are sufficient to produce the observed traffic dynamics on the narrow bridge. And that when extended to a wider bridge by replacing 'Stop' with 'Turn' the new rules are sufficient to produce several key characteristics of the dynamics on the wide bridge, in particular three-lane formation...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a simple model of self-propelled particles connected by linear springs that describes a semi-rigid formation of active agents without explicit <b>alignment</b> <b>rules.</b> The model displays a discontinuous transition {{at a critical}} noise level, below which the group self-organizes into a collectively translating or rotating state. We identify a novel elasticity-based mechanism that cascades self-propulsion energy towards lower-energy modes as responsible for such collective motion and illustrate it by computing the spectral decomposition of the elastic energy. We study the model's convergence dynamics {{as a function of}} system size and derive analytical stability conditions for the translating state in a continuous elastic sheet approximation. We explore the dynamics of a ring-shaped configuration and of local angular perturbations of an aligned state. We show that the elasticity-based mechanism achieves collective motion even in cases with heterogeneous self-propulsion speeds. Given its robustness, simplicity and ubiquity, this mechanism could play a relevant role in various biological and artificial swarms. Â© IOP Publishing and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.
