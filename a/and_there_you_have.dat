500|$|The arrest {{occurred}} {{about two}} weeks before the release of Grant's first major studio film, Nine Months, which he was scheduled to promote on several American television shows. The Tonight Show with Jay Leno had him booked for the same week. In the much-watched interview, Grant was noted for not making excuses for the incident after Leno asked him, [...] "What the hell were you thinking?" [...] Grant answered, [...] "I think you know in life what's {{a good thing to do}} and what's a bad thing, and I did a bad thing. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{the true}} {{account of the}} stupid affair of Tavora, which was to produce, as we shall see, such {{far-reaching}} effects upon persons nowise concerned in it.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is {{that you}} say?" [...] cried Tom Brown {{examining}} the bullet-hole; [...] "ha! I claim that lioness, because I fired at her head last night, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the bullet-hole." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{you face}} a problem, solve it then <b>and</b> <b>there</b> if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the facts {{necessary}} {{to make a decision}} ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you advised of that?" [...] he said. [...] "In King James's time, indeed, I have {{appeared}} in the tilt-yard, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> might <b>have</b> said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> succeeded, Dick, though I {{feel that}} with a trifling {{alteration}} here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> could <b>have</b> cleared yourself. Now we'll let the painful matter drop for good, unless, indeed, some fresh light is ever thrown on it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{not only}} the shrewdness {{of the man who}} knows how to choose his servants--which {{is one of the most}} {{important}} factors of success--but a breadth of mind very unusual indeed in the Cinquecento.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Look at it {{from the}} right point of view, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> us--official and effectual. It's like a limited game of cricket. A field of outsiders are always going in to bowl at the Public Service, and we block the balls.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{the whole}} {{source of all}} the {{unbridled}} accusations subsequently launched against Cesare, all of which find a prominent place in Gregorovius's Geschichte der Stadt Rom, whilst the rumours accusing others, which we have mentioned here, are there slurred over.|$|E
6000|$|INCRED. Then said old Incredulity: 'Sir, If I live I will do your errand to Diabolus, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>have</b> {{an answer}} to your words. Meanwhile we will seek {{the good of the}} town, and not ask counsel of you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Thomas; I {{might as}} well tell you, {{although}} I wanted to surprise you. You are to go to Putnam Hall, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> with <b>you</b> Lawrence Colby, Frank Harrington, and several other lads with whom you are all acquainted." ...|$|R
60|$|My friends, {{among these}} very {{woodlands}} here, some thirteen hundred years ago, <b>you</b> might <b>have</b> come upon {{one of the}} places where your forefathers worshipped Thor and Odin, the thunder and the wind, beneath the shade of ancient oaks, in the darkest heart of the forest. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> seen an ugly sight enough.|$|R
60|$|But I learned--or thought I learned. Power, I {{discovered}} early. My {{father had}} power. He was a magnate--I {{believe that is}} the correct phrase. Power was what I needed. But how? I was a woman. Again I dreamed my dream--a modified dream. Only by marriage could I win to power. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the clew to me and what I am and have become. I met {{the man who was}} to become my husband. He was clean and strong and an athlete, an outdoor man, a wealthy man and a rising politician. Father told me that if I married him he would make him the power of his state, make him governor, send him to the United States Senate. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> it all.|$|E
60|$|DON JUAN. Why, {{to be able}} {{to choose}} the line of {{greatest}} advantage instead of yielding {{in the direction of the}} least resistance. Does a ship sail to its destination no better than a log drifts nowhither? The philosopher is Nature's pilot. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> our difference: to be in hell is to drift: to be in heaven is to steer.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course, because I lay {{myself out}} to do it. Buy a bottle of champagne, drink it off, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to show for your total {{permanent}} investment on the transaction {{the memory of a}} noisy evening and a headache the next morning. Buy a flute, or a book of poems, or a little picture, or a Palissy platter, and you have something to turn to with delight and admiration for half a lifetime.' ...|$|E
50|$|Damas Island is {{the only}} place that has camping and picnicking {{facilities}} <b>and</b> to get <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to contract the services of fishermen in the vicinity of Punta de Choros cove.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you be a}} fool, Kla'uns, <b>and</b> {{leave it}} <b>there!</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> done your work of fighting--mighty good fighting, too,--and {{everybody}} knows it. You've earned a change. Let others take your place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will get}} into a quiet street first, Francois, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>have</b> a drink, from a flask of {{excellent}} wine I have here. Then we will help you along. You can lean as heavily as you like upon us. You are no great weight, now; and anyone who notices us helping you will suppose that we are conveying a drunken comrade to his home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You can't. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> put in {{two words}} just what I've {{been trying to}} make clear all the time. Don't you see that that's the terrible thing about life, that nobody can do more than tell anybody anything? Life's nothing but words, words, words; and how are we to know when words are true? How am I to know that you didn't ask me to marry you out of sheer pity and an exaggerated sense of justice?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Our ramble took us on {{the hills}} {{commanding}} an extensive prospect. [...] "Now," [...] said Scott, [...] "I have brought you, like the pilgrim in the Pilgrim's Progress, {{to the top of}} the Delectable Mountains, that I may show you all the goodly regions hereabouts. Yonder is Lammermuir, and Smalholme; <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> Gallashiels, and Torwoodlie, and Gallawater; and in that direction you see Teviotdale, and the Braes of Yarrow; and Ettrick stream, winding along, like a silver thread, to throw itself into the Tweed." ...|$|E
60|$|There are {{the makings}} of a very fine creed about Mormonism. To begin with, the Church is rather more {{absolute}} than that of Rome. Drop the polygamy plank in the platform, {{but on the other hand}} deal lightly with certain forms of excess; keep the quality of the recruit down to the low mental level, and see that the best of all the agricultural science available is in the hands of the elders, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a first-class engine for pioneer work. The tawdry mysticism and the borrowing from Freemasonry serve the low caste Swede and Dane, the Welshman and the Cornish cotter, just as well as a highly organized heaven.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Macumazahn," [...] he put in, in Zulu, [...] "the {{diamonds}} {{are surely}} <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>have</b> them, since <b>you</b> white men are {{so fond of}} toys and money." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>And</b> bingo, right <b>there,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the {{ultimate}} Palm Beach response, the ideal mélange of politeness and refusal, of manners and condescension, of give but give no more, whose implication is the town’s unofficial motto: If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to ask, <b>you</b> don’t belong here.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{agree with}} you, Mr. Dunkerley," [...] said Parkson. [...] "I don't know if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> read Sesame <b>and</b> Lilies, but <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> set forth far more fairly than any words of mine could do, an {{ideal of a}} woman's place ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must remember, my dear Miss Mayberry," [...] {{said the}} gentleman, [...] "that {{we do not}} know what our {{language}} will be in eight hundred or a thousand years from now. The English of to-day may be utterly unintelligible to the readers of that era, but that portion of our literature which I put into imperishable and unchangeable Greek will be the same then as now. The scholar may read it for his own pleasure and profit, or he may translate it for the pleasure and profit of others. At all events, it will be there, like a fly in amber, good for all time. All you have to do is to melt your amber, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> your fly." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the second}} place, {{it was my}} good or ill fortune, I hardly know which, to find myself {{personally}} involved--at the period of which I am now writing--in {{the mystery of the}} Indian Diamond. I had the honour of an interview, at my own office, with an Oriental stranger of distinguished manners, who was no other, unquestionably, than the chief of the three Indians. Add to this, that I met with the celebrated traveller, Mr. Murthwaite, the day afterwards, and that I held a conversation with him {{on the subject of the}} Moonstone, which has a very important bearing on later events. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the statement of my claims to fill the position which I occupy in these pages.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is for you, Judith; it is {{altogether}} for you. The chist is your'n, or your father's; and Hutter is your father, not mine. Cur'osity is a woman's, {{and not a}} man's failing, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got all {{the reasons}} before you. If the chist has articles for ransom, {{it seems to me}} they would be wisely used in redeeming their owner's life, or even in saving his scalp; but that is a matter for your judgment, and not for ourn. When the lawful owner of a trap, or a buck, or a canoe, isn't present, his next of kin becomes his riprisentyve by all the laws of the woods. We therefore leave you to say whether the chist shall, or shall not be opened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You need have no alarm," [...] he smiled. [...] "We are not pursued. They {{must have}} {{realized}} {{the futility of}} attempting to overtake us. Courage, mademoiselle. We shall be in Grenoble presently, <b>and</b> once <b>there,</b> <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> nothing more to fear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} a rumour," [...] she said slowly; [...] "there has been a word spoken here <b>and</b> <b>there</b> about <b>you.</b> I've <b>had</b> my doubts sometimes. I have them again every time you speak. Are you really Everard Dominey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know that}} your parents had no great possession, and that what they had was secured to your mother <b>and</b> to <b>you.</b> <b>There</b> <b>has</b> been no new discovery, of money, or of any other property; but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because he {{scatters}} halfpence to Tramps and such-like," [...] {{returned the}} Landlord, [...] "and {{of course they}} pick 'em up. And this being done on his own land (which it is his own land, you observe, and were his family's before him), why it is but regarding the halfpence as gold and silver, and turning the ownership of the property a bit round your finger, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{the name of the}} children's game complete. And it's appropriate too," [...] said the Landlord, with his favourite action of stooping a little, to look across the table out of window at vacancy, under the window-blind which was half drawn down. [...] "Leastwise it has been so considered by many gentlemen which have partook of chops and tea in the present humble parlour." ...|$|E
60|$|If {{you recall}} the Americans {{in the nineteenth}} century who wrote books that lived forty-two years you will have to begin with Cooper; you can follow with Washington Irving, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Edgar Allan Poe, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to wait a long time. You come to Emerson, and you have to stand still and look further. You find Howells and T. B. Aldrich, and then your numbers begin to run pretty thin, and you {{question}} if you can name twenty persons in the United States who--in a whole century have written books that would live forty-two years. Why, you could take them all and put them on one bench there [pointing]. Add the wives and children and you could put the result on, two or three more benches.|$|E
60|$|Or {{would you}} prefer {{something}} less sensational, something more in the romantic line? Very well. Hero, {{on his way to}} the Dowager Duchess's ball, slips on a banana-peel and smashes his only pair of spectacles. He dare not fail to attend the ball, for the dear Duchess would never forgive him; so he goes in and proposes to a girl he particularly dislikes because she is dressed in pink, and the heroine told him that she was going to wear pink. But the heroine's pink dress was late in coming home from the modiste's and she had to turn up in blue. The heroine comes in just as the other girl is accepting him, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a nice, live, peppy, kick-off for your tale of passion and human interest.|$|E
5000|$|... "When {{you are on}} stage, {{you don't}} see faces. The lights are in your eyes and you see just this black void {{out in front of}} you. <b>And</b> yet <b>you</b> know <b>there</b> is life out <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to get your message across." ...|$|R
5000|$|But let me {{return to}} the enemy {{breakthrough}} in the Kiev area, the encirclement of our group, {{and the destruction of}} the 37th Army. Later, the Fifth Army also perished ... All of this was senseless, and from the military point of view, a display of ignorance, incompetence, <b>and</b> illiteracy. ... <b>There</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the result of not taking a step backward. We were unable to save these troops because we didn't withdraw them, and as a result we simply lost them. ... And yet it was possible to allow this not to happen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{was very}} unhappy. When you flashed upon me there at Croker's Hall, I knew at {{once all the}} joy that had fallen within my reach. <b>You</b> were <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> come for me! All the way from Kimberley, just for me to smile upon you! Did you not?" ...|$|R
