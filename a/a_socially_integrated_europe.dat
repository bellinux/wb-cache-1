This article critically analyses the theoretical bases of the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe and tries to explain why its ratification is so problematic. Authors such as Habermas have argued that a new European model of social cohesion is needed, and Habermas suggests that the sense of ‘community’ in a democratic Europe should be founded exclusively on the acceptance of a patriotic constitution. However, this view is criticised by authors such as Weiler and MacCormick. In this article, I explain the limits of these theoretical analyses. I will argue that a European constitutional project can be more than formally legal only if two normative conditions are satisfied: it is the result of public debate and the European Constitution includes the procedures for the recognition of European national diversity. I suggest that a theory of constitutional multinationalism, similar to the one proposed by Tully, might provide an attractive model for a European social integration. The article is divided in two parts. In the first, I explain why Habermas’ constitutional patriotism or MacCormick's states based Europe cannot provide a convincing theoretical model for <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> and constitutionally <b>integrated</b> <b>Europe.</b> In the second part, I will give an outline of Tully's idea of multinational democracy as a model for a European constitutional integration...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{processes}} {{and challenges of}} creating <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> <b>integrated,</b> empowered immigrant identity by exploring the concepts acculturation model. The author examines the psychology of acculturation and the processes for creating <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> <b>integrated</b> bicultural self for immigrants who retain cultural tradi-tions while adapting to new social norms and practices. The complexity of this process embraces principles from both social and cultural psychological paradigms and emphasizes a non-dual approach for creating meaning for a bicultural individual acculturating into a new society. The experience of moving to another town or across the country is stressful. There is discomfort of not knowing neighbors, being a new student at school, having no mental map of the surrounding communities, and wondering if other residents are multiculturally competent. However, what is the psychological process like for immigrants moving to another country, immers-ing themselves into a new culture, language and sociopolitical ecology? The additional pressures of {{learning a new language}} and culture, while possibly dealing with oppression, racism, and marginalization enforced by xenophobic policies can be overwhelming for immigrants without institutional support (Berry...|$|R

In Chinese traditional culture, elders assume <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> <b>integrated</b> and productive social role within the family.

Two hierarchical regression models were tested. Step one entered age, gender, married, financial adequacy, live alone, and reading ability.

Communication before and during the departure of the first individual may {{play a crucial role in}} synchronizing a collective movement. We hypothesized that individuals in a wild primate group use signals or cues prior to and after departure to achieve collective movements. With two observers we used all-occurrences behavior sampling of collective movements in a group of wild Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) in the Middle Atlas, Morocco. The number of individuals displaying pre-departure behavior predicted the success of an initiation of a collective movement. Pauses of the first departing individual after departure enhanced following behavior and might have served as recruitment signal. However, the opposite was the case for back-glancing, which functions as a monitoring signal in other species. Because in our study frequently back-glancing individuals were also less <b>socially</b> <b>integrated,</b> back glances may better be interpreted as indicators of hesitation and insecurity.

In the era of diversity where all residents need to be respected, finding the optimal group in providing shared spaces is essential for satisfying residents to the greatest extent. Shared spaces considered here are those for general residents and for the elderly residents. In this context, this study intended to compare space arrangement preferences of three different age groups for creating a community with diverse shared facilities. Online ques-tionnaire survey was conducted to collect data from residents in their 30 s, 40 s and 50 s; and individual interviews of residents in their 60 s and 70 s.

In addition to the various policies implemented since the signing of the Association agreement in 2002, the article also interrogates the agendas of local institutions and actors who support or resist this transformative influence. After an introductory section that presents the concept of human capital and its relevance for the Euro-Algerian context, the following sections show how the Euro-Algerian cooperation draws on technologies of standardization, securitization and responsibilization in order to shape <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> <b>integrated,</b> politically and economically moral subject. This empirical analysis serves to understand the ordoliberal character of this intervention. Indeed, the goal of the European Union is not merely to propose a technical intervention in order to promote a stable environment for the modernization of the economy. Instead, the shaping of Algeria's human resources, with the support of diverse segments of the ruling elite, shows the depth of a restructuring that is also political. The relationship between the nation-state and its population is thus affected, as the former is associated with an anthropological process that must foster both economic efficiency and civic awareness.

The wider benefits are defined as encompassing both non-pecuniary private benefits (such as improved self-esteem, health and quality of life) and those impacting on {{society as a whole}} (such as community regeneration and cultural development). Through quantitative and qualitative analysis of questionnaires distributed to practitioners in 35 FE colleges in conjunction with the Learning and Skills Development Agency, the types of benefits arising from FE and the mechanisms involved in the production of those benefits are examined. Results indicate that esteem, self-efficacy and the development of social networks are important benefits of FE and that purposive social interaction is a major factor in producing social benefits. This is particularly the case in health and humanities subjects. The policy implications for FE are that <b>a</b> diverse, <b>socially</b> <b>integrated</b> and less administratively burdened sector is required if wider benefits are to be realised...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} the {{dissertation}} is marketization in education in light of social justice and the school as <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> <b>integrating</b> institution. This is related to recent developments where market-oriented policies have been introduced in public education, challenging socialdemocratic principles and ideals. In this study, I examine {{the consequences of this}} development on the micro-level in primary and lower secondary schools in the Oslo area. For many years, Oslo had a conservative city council, and since the early 1990 s the local authority has {{gone to great lengths to}} introduce political initiatives that incite competition between schools and stimulate parents to navigate their choice of schools in the same way consumers act in a market. This has become evident through the introduction of various initiatives, such as parental choice, publication of test results, per-capita funding and performance management. I have studied how these initiatives are realized and experienced on the local level by school leaders in Oslo. Taking as my point of departure Ball, Maguire and Braun’s (2012) theory of policy enactment, and Fraser’s (1997, 2003, 2009) theory of social justice, I have studied three constituent aspects of policy work: The material, the interpretive, and the discursive. Bearing these aspects in mind, I have studied which perspectives of justice serve as the foundation for internal marketization in Oslo. I have studied how policy initiatives that can be understood as an expression of internal marketization materialize in local contexts, and I have studied what characterizes school leaders’ interpretation and translation of policies in local contexts. The analysis of perspectives of justice in political documents shows that internal marketization is justified by emphasizing that it takes democratic participation and institutional autonomy into consideration. This can be described as a political concept of social justice. The analysis also shows that the education policy authorities in Oslo have clear strategies to promote social mobility through school. This strategy is characterized by the fact that it is largely defined according to a socio-economic concept of injustice, that it explicitly relates to the school's ability to close the performance gap between students with different social backgrounds and that there are few references to justice as a matter of social recognition or cultural and institutional patterns of interaction. This is expressed through descriptions of social mobility as conditioned by the school's ability to reduce the importance of socio-economic background on educational achievement, and through the absence of references to how the situation of students in school can be understood from a cultural perspective of justice. The analysis of how policy measures materialize locally reveals that while some schools experience that this context gives them advantages when it comes to recruitment of pupils and economic stability, others describe the opposite effect. These different experiences contribute to a polarization between schools along ethnic and social lines of division which affect the schools’ economic situation, their reputation and “value” in the local school market. The analysis of school leaders’ interpretation and translation of policy in local contexts shows that even though they have institutional and professional autonomy, formally, there are several conditions within this management context which discipline school leaders in a way that contributes to a conformist and decontextualized local practice. From a justice perspective, these discipline mechanisms seem to affect the dialogue between various levels in the educational system in a manner that undermines democratic participation and representation, particularly with respect to what school leaders describe as limited possibilities to communicate about challenges linked to how pupils’ social and cultural backgrounds are relevant in the education context. All in all, the study shows that in this context school leaders are expected to compensate for differences along social and ethnic dividing lines in a system that contributes to reinforcing the same inequities, and where the possibilities for communicating about local challenges are limited by a politically defined understanding of the situation. Grounded in a critical policy research approach, where policies are understood as both intention and practice, I argue that these unintended consequences must be understood as a part of the current political climate. This, I conclude, is a necessary prerequisite for an authentic political and public debate on whether or not concurring priorities in educational politics contribute to undermining the school’s potential as <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> <b>integrating</b> institution...|$|R

My starting point is that the cultural scene of that time referred to certain elements of modernism, such as the search for national identity and the role of intellectuals as protagonists, and helped to prepare the “cultural hegemony ” of the national-popular left after the 1964 coup.

The findings, although not surprising when placed in the broader urbanism literature, are not explainable by any single ‘school’ of urbanism. Researchers are recommended to adjudicate among {{the old and new}} models of urbanism and focus on integrated knowledge such as the growing threats of geographic inequity and spatial injustice in contemporary metropolitan areas. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNon-breeding common ravens (Corvus corax) live {{in complex}} social groups {{with a high}} degree of fission–fusion dynamics. They form {{valuable}} relationships and alliances with some conspecifics, while taking coordinated action against others. In ravens, affiliates reconcile their conflicts, console each other after conflicts with a third party, and provide each other with social support — all behaviors that presumably reduce corticosterone levels and alleviate stress. However, how well <b>an</b> individual is <b>socially</b> <b>integrated</b> in <b>a</b> (sub) group might vary substantially. This raises the question whether the social integration of a raven affects its stress responses to fission–fusion dynamics. The present study aims to investigate this effect experimentally by separating single ravens (n= 16) individually from their group for four days and subsequently reintroducing them. To determine stress response patterns in the separated individuals we measured the amounts of immunoreactive corticosterone metabolites (CM) in droppings. We compared two enzyme immunoassays, which we validated by conducting an ACTH challenge, and finally decided to apply an 11 -oxoetiocholanolone enzyme immunoassay. Additionally, we determined levels of social integration using focal observations. Our findings suggest that a strong social integration is related to low CM levels when the individuals are within the group and high levels during separations, implying that separation leads to stress in these birds. In contrast, poorly <b>socially</b> <b>integrated</b> ravens seem to exhibit the opposite pattern, indicating that to them group living is more stressful than being temporarily separated. We, therefore, conclude that the birds' adrenocortical activity is modulated by their social integration...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: This thesis {{investigated}} how {{demographic variables}} affected the social well-being amongst ethnic minorities in Central Europe, building on acculturation and social capital theory. Method: The {{sample consisted of}} 543 respondents from six different countries in Central Europe, all stating that they belonged to an ethnic minority group. Data {{was provided by the}} European Social Survey, round 3. Social well-being was measured as two different outcomes; feeling of being <b>socially</b> <b>integrated</b> and civic engagement. Binary and logistic regression was used to assess the predictive power of the demographic variables on the outcome variables. Results: Five of the demographic variables were found to be significantly associated with the feeling of being <b>socially</b> <b>integrated.</b> The strongest predictor was age, indicating that higher age predicts higher levels of feeling of being <b>socially</b> <b>integrated.</b> For the civic engagement model, only parents born in country' and urbanization' were found to be significantly associated with civic engagement. Discussion: The different measures of social well-being; feeling of being <b>socially</b> <b>integrated</b> and civic engagement, were predicted by different variables. The feeling of being <b>socially</b> <b>integrated</b> model gives support to earlier empirical findings, where income, age, and language play an important role. The civic engagement model explained less variance than the feeling of being <b>socially</b> <b>integrated</b> model. This suggests that other variables are more important in the prediction of civic engagement than those included in this study...|$|R

A cross sectional survey, involving 175 smokers attending smoking cessation clinics at the Institute of Psychiatry, London, United Kingdom and University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia between May 2005 and February 2007. Data on demographics, smoking history, nicotine dependence and smoking behaviour were collected. Results. All participants were males, mean age 30. 7 ± 10. 3 years. Caucasians initiated smoking significantly ear- lier (mean age 14. 8 ± 2. 8 years) (p = 0. 001) and smoked regularly significantly earlier (mean age 17. 3 ± 3. 5) (p = 0. 003) than Malays (mean starting age 16. 9 ± 4. 4 years and mean age regular use 19. 5 ± 4. 5 years), re- spectively. Caucasians smoked less for social integration than Malays (p = 0. 03) but smoked more for regulation of negative affect than Malays (p = 0. 008) and smoked more for hedonism than Malays (p b 0. 001). Conclusion. Malays smoke as <b>a</b> means of <b>socially</b> <b>integrating.</b> This has important public health implications. Social reasons and the social environment {{play a role in}} smoking uptake, smoking maintenance and smoking cessation and this should be borne in mind for strategies planning to promote smoking cessation...|$|R

The survey results suggested that participants are <b>socially</b> <b>integrated</b> and satisfied with their jobs at a moderate level, and highly satisfied with their life in Australia. The results also indicated that social integration influences their level of life and job satisfaction. Findings suggest {{that there is a need}} to focus on developing and implementing policies that encourage supportive and inclusive behaviours towards skilled migrants at the societal and organisational level...|$|R

40|$|U ovom radu autori su se bavili mjestom i ulogom vjernika laika u Crkvi, odnosno, u sociološkom smislu, crkvenom religioznošću. Istraživali su stav vjernika laika prema liturgiji, Učiteljstvu, zajedništvu u Crkvi, te prisutnost kultumo-identifikacijskog momenta u postojećoj crkvenoj religioznosti. Rezultati pokazuju da je kod značajnog dijela populacije prisutan pozitivan odnos prema liturgiji i zajedništvu u Crkvi. Kada je riječ o ulozi Učiteljstva, većina vjernika smatra kako oni mogu biti dobri vjernici i ukoliko njihovo razmišljanje i praksa bitno odstupaju od naučavanja Učiteljstva. U svezi s kulturnom dimenzijom kršćanstva, dobiveno je da dio populacije svoju religijsku pripadnost veže prije svega uz kulturnu i nacionalnu identifikaciju, što je i bilo za očekivati iz mnogih razloga. Istraživanje je pokazalo, da uz crkvenu religioznost u promatranom smislu, relativno više pristaju stariji, manje obrazovani i rođeni na selu, što ukazuje na to da je sadašnja obredna praksa primjerenija tom tipu vjernika. Mladi, obrazovaniji, urbani vjernici pokazuju veću kritičnost prema tradicionalnom modelu crkvene religioznosti, i evidentno su otvoreniji za traganje, kako za novom crkvenom, tako i za necrkvenom religijskom praksom. The {{authors were}} {{interested}} in the place and role of laymen in the Catholic Church. They measured the attitudes of Croatian citizens toward liturgy, hierarchy, presence of community in the Church and presence of a cultural identification in the existing Church religiosity. They found that there is {{a significant part of the}} population for which there exists a positive attitude toward liturgy, and to being together in Church. In relation to hierarchy, they found that most believers believe that they can be good catholics without listening to the Pope and bishops. And they found that part of the population finds only cultural and national identification in the existing church religiosity. With factor analysis, they extracted four factors on sixteen variables which show: unreligiosity, individual religiosity, nominal Christianity (religiosity), distant Christianity, and social role of the Church. The first factor is mostly asserted by people who are at a distance from the official Church religiosity, younger people with higher education, born in cities, more politically oriented to the left. The second factor is more acceptable to people who are also at a distance to Church religiosity, and by lower educated people, and more from Orthodox believers. Distance Christianity is also more strongly supported by people who are, of course, distant from Church religiosity. The social role of the Church is more stressed by older people who want to find some place for their social life than by younger people. This opinion is widely spread among the population. Almost 90 % of the population believe that the Church should have <b>a</b> <b>socially</b> <b>integrating</b> role. Generally, we found that younger people, with higher education, and urbanised people show a much more critical attitude toward Church religiosity, and they are much more open to searching for new religious experience and practice in the Church, and of course, out of it, in new religious movements. The authors have recommended that the Church be made a place for dialogue and for new groups especially constituted by intellectuals, because so far they have been pretty much neglected. They can help the Church in the modern situation, especially here in Croatia after all the changes that have taken place in the last few years. To bring something like this about, a »climate« must be formed in the Church for accepting this project. Theologians have a great role to play in this task...|$|R
