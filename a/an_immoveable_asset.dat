This allows businesses to be publicly traded, and raise additional financial capital for expansion by selling shares of ownership of the company in a public market. The liquidity that an exchange affords the investors enables their holders to quickly and easily sell securities. This is an attractive feature of investing in stocks, compared to other less liquid investments such as property and other <b>immoveable</b> <b>assets.</b> Some companies actively increase liquidity by trading in their own shares.|$|R

40|$|Until recently, {{the rule}} in Quebec was that <b>an</b> <b>immoveable</b> could not be {{the object of a}} {{commercial}} operation. For many years, this anachronic rule had major effects on a number of key sectors of the law. Although unanimously criticised by academics, it was still largely applied by the courts. In 1965, a new trend appeared with the key decision of Colonia Development v. Belliveau, according to which the Court of Appeal departed for the first time from the traditional pattern, applying a new test wholly based on the purpose of the parties in entering into the agreement and refraining, by the same way, from holding that contracts in respect to <b>immoveables</b> were per se <b>a</b> civil matter. Three recent decisions of the Court of Appeal confirmed this precedent and applied it to situations involving different aspects of immoveable transactions. These decisions repeatedly adopted the purpose test definitely prefering the subjective approach to commercial activities over the objective one. This settled another important controversy between academics. After a general review of the situation since the Colonia Development case, the article spots a new dark area in the field and tries to draw a new line between civil and commercial transactions, especially when <b>an</b> <b>immoveable</b> is concerned...|$|R

40|$|On September 30 th, 1977, the Supreme Court of Canada has {{delivered}} a judgment {{in the case}} of Cablevision (Montreal) Inc. v. Le Sous-ministre du Revenu de la province de Québec, where the fundamental problem of the qualification of things has once more been reviewed. In this instance, the Court had to qualify a network of wires and various apparatus belonging to the appellant and fixed, under a lease, by this corporation to poles being the property of the Bell Telephone Co. and the Hydro-Québec Corporation, as well as an antenna, also belonging to Cablevision, fixed to the roof of the Montreal skyscraper Place Ville-Marie, the property again of a third party. All these things, formerly moveables, have been held by the Supreme Court to have become immoveable by nature, due to their close attachment to the buildings to which they were affixed. This judgment will have to be distinguished from the former leading case of Nadeau v. Rousseau which held that the incorporated moveable had {{to become part of the}} building itself or be indispensable to its natural use. Since a TV antenna fixed to a building is not an essential part ofthat building nor even useful to it, the Court must fall back on the test of close attachment in order to determine its character. The writer of this paper feels this decision is sound reasoning, and recalls the true nature and origins of property immoveable by its nature. Since only land is <b>a</b> real <b>immoveable</b> by nature, buildings are held so only because of their attachment to the land. Again, things immoveable by their destination are held to be so mainly because of their close relationship to the building. The test of physical attachment is then the only true objective test to qualify moveable things when affixed to <b>an</b> <b>immoveable...</b>|$|R
40|$|Due to scarce {{financial}} resources, over-stretched budgets, {{pressures for}} service delivery and the dynamic nature of local government, asset management {{plays a key}} strategic role in enhancing local municipal functionality and efficiency. Asset management is the management of physical <b>assets,</b> infrastructure, and <b>immoveable</b> <b>assets.</b> It is <b>an</b> evolving discipline that is enhanced by the understanding of asset conditions and performance. It improves decision-making within local government. Every year, local government announces millions of Rands’ worth of assets that are unaccounted for and that go missing in annual reports. It was {{the purpose of this}} study to assess the asset management function at the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (NMBM). The aim is to improve the management of moveable assets by investigating the following variables: strategic management of assets, knowledge management, governance, leadership, the impact of corruption and skills management. The approach to the study is a qualitative research paradigm with a case study methodology and an interview as a research instrument. The sample chosen comprised people from the top level of municipal management down to municipal asset controllers. The two forms of data that were collected in the study were primary data and secondary data. Primary data was collected from municipal workers and collated together for analysis purposes. Secondary data was gathered from library sources such as journals, books, conference papers, government acts, municipal policies and local newspapers. This data informed the interview questions. The interview strategy was chosen as the best way to conduct the empirical part of this research and was guided by an interview guide. The study found that there are operational defects in the way asset management is organised. This makes the function seem unimportant. The results also indicated a lack of staff members and skills shortages; such as management and computer skills. Indications are that theft, negligence, corruption and carelessness negatively impact the management of assets. Recommendations include the filling of vacant posts, tightening of internal controls, providing the necessary training and improving the asset management.

As a multitude of weak, imitative natures are always lying by, ready to go mad upon the next wrong idea that may be broached--in these times, generally some form of tribute to Somebody for something that never was done, or, if ever done, that was done by Somebody Else--so these less ordinary natures may lie by for years, ready on the touch of an instant to burst into flame.|$|R

Dineley writes:The 17th day of March yeerly is St Patricks, <b>an</b> <b>immoveable</b> feast, when ye Irish of all stations and condicions were crosses in their hatts, some of pinns, some of green ribbon, and the vulgar superstitiously wear shamroges, 3 leav'd grass, which they likewise eat (they say) to cause a sweet breath.There is nothing in Dineley's account of the legend of St. Patrick using the shamrock to teach the mystery of the Holy Trinity, and this story does not appear in writing anywhere until a 1726 work by the botanist Caleb Threlkeld. Threlkeld identifies the shamrock as White Field Clover (Trifolium pratense album [...] ) and comments rather acerbically on the custom of wearing the shamrock on St. Patrick's Day:This plant is worn by the people in their hats upon the 17. Day of March yearly, (which is called St. Patrick's Day.) It being a current tradition, that by this Three Leafed Grass, he emblematically set forth to them the Mystery of the Holy Trinity. However that be, when they wet their Seamar-oge, they often commit excess in liquor, which is not a right keeping of a day to the Lord; error generally leading to debauchery.The Rev Threlkeld's remarks on liquor undoubtedly refer to the custom of toasting St. Patrick's memory with [...] "St. Patrick's Pot", or [...] "drowning the shamrock" [...] as it is otherwise known. After mass on St. Patrick's Day the traditional custom of the menfolk was to lift the usual fasting restrictions of Lent and repair to the nearest tavern to mark the occasion with as many St. Patrick's Pots as they deemed necessary.

40|$|Title: Intra-and inter-reliability {{of lower}} {{extremity}} muscle strength measurements using a hand-held dynamometer {{with and without}} a stabilization strap Authors: Emerenciana Ferro (PhD student); Dr. Elaine Trudelle-Jackson, Angie McQueary Chris Huff, and Jami Thomas Texas Woman’s University Purpose/Hypothesis: Study’s purposes: 1) determine the intra-and inter-tester reliability of the HHD with and without a stabilization strap for measuring quadriceps and hamstring strength, and 2) compare quadriceps and hamstring strength values obtained using a HHD with and without a stabilization strap. We hypothesized that intra- and inter-tester reliability would be improved with a strap, and muscle strength measured with a strap would be different than when measured without a strap. Number of subjects: 24 men and women (Mean age: 27. 87 ± 2. 22 years). Materials/Methods: 2 trained entry-level students of physical therapy measured participants’ quadriceps and hamstring strength in the seated position using the same test procedures. Each of the testers performed the tests under 2 conditions: 1) securing the HHD to the lower leg just proximal to the medial and lateral malleoli on the anterior aspect for knee extensors, and posterior aspect for knee flexors, using a strap affixed to <b>an</b> <b>immoveable</b> object, and 2) stabilizing the HHD manually in the same locations as for condition 1. Two trials were performed for each test condition and the other of testing under the 2 conditions randomized. One tester repeated the tests under both conditions after a 20 min rest to assess intra-tester reliability. Results: Intra-tester reliability for measuring knee flexion and extension using a HHD with strap stabilization was excellent (ICC 3, 2 =. 93 and. 94, respectively). Intra-tester reliability of measurements taken without strap stabilization for knee flexion and extension was also excellent (ICC 3, 2 =. 90 and. 91, respectively). Inter-tester reliability for measuring knee flexion and extension using the HHD with a strap was good (ICC 2, 2 =. 87 and. 88) while inter-tester reliability without a stabilization strap was poor (ICC 2, 2 =. 71 and. 54, respectively). A dependent t-test showed {{no significant difference between}} hamstring strength values when taken with and without a strap (t= - 1. 52, p = 1. 41) but quadriceps strength values obtained with a stabilization strap were significantly greater (t= 5. 93, p 3 ̆c. 001) than measurements taken without a strap. Conclusions: A HHD can be used effectively by a single tester to measure quadriceps and hamstring strength with or without a stabilization strap. When different testers are used however, a strap is needed to get consistent measures...|$|R
40|$|The Harderian gland is an orbital gland {{thought to}} be a source of corneal lubricant, {{supplementary}} to the other orbital glands. This study investigated the possible role of skink Harderian glands in corneal lubrication. It was hypothesized that if these glands play a role in corneal lubrication, then the structure of these glands would be affected by structural orbital modifications. We examined the Harderian and lacrimal glands of five species of Australian skinks (Lygosominae), two of which possessed orbital modifications in the form of <b>a</b> transparent <b>immoveable</b> eyelid (spectacle) and skull reduction. All species possessed well-developed posterior lacrimal glands, but no anterior lacrimal glands. Anatomically, the Harderian glands were smaller in the burrowing species relative to the nonburrowing species. No other obvious species-specific differences were observed. The absence of any differentiation at the microscopic level suggests that although there is some change in the relative amount of secretant produced, the nature of the secretion studied by classical histochemistry remains essentially unchanged. However, at higher taxonomic levels, the size and structure of the Harderian gland may be taxon-specific and unrelated to the orbital environment. Thus, orbital lubrication may not necessarily be the sole function of the Harderian gland. S. J. Rehorek, M. N. Hutchinson, and B. T. Firt...|$|R

40|$|While {{most people}} {{experience}} their nationality as a fixed and integral feature of their identity, {{it is not}} necessarily <b>a</b> permanent or <b>immoveable</b> characteristic. Indeed, most States’ nationality laws feature a set of rules—alongside those which elaborate the conditions for acquisition of nationality—which stipulate the grounds upon which a national can lose or be deprived of that nationality. With concern rising about international terrorism and now the phenomenon of foreign fighters, governments have been rediscovering nationality policy as a potential instrument in the protection of their national security interests. This chapter highlights a range of States’ perspectives on the deprivation of nationality and discusses recent developments in national-level debate and/or policy around the deprivation of nationality from foreign fighters. It then goes on to explore the international law implications of an expanded use of such deprivation powers. In particular, the chapter looks at the international law prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of nationality and what this requires of States that would seek to deprive a person of nationality in response to their engagement in an armed conflict in a third country. It discusses how international legal standards relating to the prevention of Statelessness restrict States’ powers of deprivation of nationality and asks what the significance is of such restrictions for the enjoyment of nationality by dual nationals. Finally, the chapter also assesses to what extent different approaches to the deprivation of nationality from foreign fighters pose a challenge {{from the perspective of the}} international law principle of non-discrimination...|$|R
60|$|The Pont Neuf {{was crowded}} with troops, who {{occupied}} the trottoirs, and with men, women, and children. There had been some skirmishing at the Place de Grève, and {{the scene of the}} principal contest, the Rue St. Méry, was near by. We were slowly threading the crowd with our faces towards the island, when a discharge of musketry (four or five pieces at most), directly behind us, and quite near, set everybody in motion. A flock of sheep would not have scattered in greater confusion, at the sudden appearance of a strange dog among them, than the throng on the bridge began to scamper. Fear is the most contagious of all diseases, and, for a moment, we found ourselves running with the rest. A jump or two sufficed, however, and we stopped. Two soldiers, one a National Guard, and the other a young conscript, belonging to the line, caught my eye, and knowing there was no danger, we had time to stop and laugh at them. The National Guard was a little Mayeux-looking fellow, with an abdomen like a pumpkin, and he had caught hold of his throat, as if it were actually to prevent his heart from jumping out of his mouth. A caricature of fright could scarcely be more absurd. The young conscript, a fair red-haired youth, was as white as a sheet, and he stood with his eyes and mouth open, like one who thought he saw <b>a</b> ghost, <b>immoveable</b> as <b>a</b> statue. He was sadly frightened, too. The boy would probably have come to, and proved a good soldier in the end; but as for Mr. Mayeux, although scarcely five feet high, he appeared as if he could never make himself short enough. He had evidently fancied the whole affair a good joke, up to that precise moment, when, for the first time, the realities of a campaign burst upon his disordered faculties. The troops in general, while they pricked up their ears, disdained even to shoulder their arms. For those on the bridge, there was, in truth, no danger, although the nearness of the volley, and the suddenness of the alarm, were well adapted to set a crowd in motion. The papers next day, said one or two had been slain by this discharge, which actually came from the revolters.|$|R
60|$|This {{account of}} things agrees best with history when duly rectified. For [29] Justin and [30] Irenæus say, that Simon Magus came to Rome in {{the reign of}} Claudius, and {{exercised}} juggling tricks there. Pseudo-Clemens adds, that he endeavoured there to fly, but broke his neck thro' the prayers of Peter. Whence [31] Eusebius, or rather his interpolator Jerom, has recorded, that Peter came to Rome {{in the second year}} of Claudius: but [32] Cyril Bishop of Jerusalem, Philastrius, Sulpitius, Prosper, Maximus Taurinensis, and Hegesippus junior, place this victory of Peter in the time of Nero. Indeed the antienter tradition was, that Peter came to Rome in the days of this Emperor, as may be seen in [33] Lactantius. Chrysostom [34] tells us, that the Apostles continued long in Judea, and that then being driven out by the Jews they went to the Gentiles. This dispersion was {{in the first year of}} the Jewish war, when the Jews, as Josephus tells us, began to be tumultuous and violent in all places. For all agree that the Apostles were dispersed into several regions at once; and Origen has set down the time, [35] telling us that in the beginning of the Judaic war, the Apostles and disciples of our Lord were scattered into all nations; Thomas into Parthia, Andrew into Scythia, John into Asia, and Peter first into Asia, where he preacht to the dispersion, and thence into Italy. [36] Dionysius Corinthius saith, that Peter went from Asia by Corinth to Rome, and all antiquity agrees that Peter and Paul were martyred there in the end of Nero's reign. Mark went with Timothy to Rome, 2 Tim. iv. 11. Colos. iv. 10. Sylvanus was Paul's assistant; and by the companions of Peter, mentioned in his first Epistle, we may know that he wrote from Rome; and the Antients generally agree, that in this Epistle he understood Rome by Babylon. His second Epistle was writ to the same dispersed strangers with the first, 2 Pet. iii. 1. and therein he saith, that Paul had writ of the same things to them, and also in his other Epistles, ver. 15, 16. Now as there is no Epistle of Paul to these strangers besides that to the Hebrews, so in this Epistle, chap. x. 11, 12. we find at large all those things which Peter had been speaking of, and here refers to; particularly the passing away of the old heavens and earth, and establishing <b>an</b> inheritance <b>immoveable,</b> with <b>an</b> exhortation to grace, because God, to the wicked, is a consuming fire, Heb. xii. 25, 26, 28, 29.|$|R
