In this paper, the flavour quality, including flavour stability, of five commercial light beers was evaluated in comparison with their corresponding pilsner beers derived from the same breweries. Through detailed physicochemical and sensory evaluation, followed by multivariate data analysis, the fresh beers could be differentiated according to their origin (US or European) and beer style (light or pilsner). Potential flavour deficiencies of fresh light beers were determined as too much sweetness, lack of bitterness, and especially reduced fullness. As a result, the fresh light beers were less preferred than their corresponding pilsner. Upon ageing, the light beers were generally less flavour stable than their pilsner counterparts. This is mainly ascribed to increased sensory perception of cardboard and ribes staling flavours in most aged light beers.

40|$|MSc (Engineering Sciences in Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Sub-Saharan Africa is a {{treasure}} chest of natural materials remaining {{to be explored}} for commercial applications and as alternative foods to diversify and improve food sustainability. The Marula tree is available in abundance in South Africa and bears a fruit with a highly nutritious kernel containing high oil and protein content. The oil from the kernels has various applications from food to cosmetics. The <b>accepted</b> <b>oil</b> processing practice is required to be a green technology, producing no effluent or using toxic solvents. Therefore, the oil is extracted using an expeller. However, with average 55 wt. % oil in the kernel the extracted oil yield is far from optimal, typically ranging from as low as 7 wt. % to 47 wt. %. The latter is obtained only with proprietary modified expellers. Therefore, an alternative green technology which retains the native characteristics of the Marula oil is needed. Communication with local producers, South African and Namibian, confirmed the need for investigation of an alternative means of extraction of Marula oil from the seed kernels which can improve the yield and potentially {{the quality of the}} oilcake. The latter of which is typically adversely affected by the expelling process. A review of various processing technologies available for oil extraction was completed and supercritical fluid extraction utilizing carbon dioxide as the extraction solvent was identified as a potential solution. An overview on supercritical fluid extraction using carbon dioxide (SFE-CO 2) of similar materials to the Marula kernels, such as hazelnuts, walnuts and pine kernels indicates that yields similar to that of solvent extraction and {{of the quality of the}} oils obtained by cold pressing can be obtained with the technique. The theory, practical applications, and how one can use the system to improve yield from various natural materials were reviewed. It was determined that the two main parameters one can manipulate on supercritical extraction systems to optimize the yield, were pressure and temperature. Subsequently kernels of the Sclerocarya birrea tree, common name Marula, cultivated in South Africa, were obtained for extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide. The effects of pressure and temperature on extraction yield were investigated. The total maximum yield of Marula kernel oil obtained was found to be 54 wt. %, compared to a solvent extracted yield of 52 wt. %, such that a 100 % oil recovery was obtained with SFE-CO 2. The optimal conditions were found to be 450 bar and 60 °C as the yield per kg solvent initially was 41 g kg- 1 CO 2. Following the extractions, the oils were characterized for fatty acid composition using gas chromatography. Quality parameters of a cold pressed sample and a sample obtained at the optimal extraction conditions were determined and compared; and the results indicate that the two oils are of similar composition and quality. Supercritical fluid extraction using carbon dioxide was successfully verified as a potential processing method for the extraction of Marula oil from the kernels. The SFE-CO 2 provided an improved yield compared to cold pressing and a quality of oil similar to cold pressed Marula oil. Additionally, after SFE-CO 2 processing, the defatted Marula kernels contain high protein content, 69 wt. %, in the form of a pure white powder. Due to the favourable nutritional content the residue may be used for human consumption to create new products such as meat analogues, porridges, and shakes, or can be sold as a high protein powder.

40|$|This master thesis {{was written}} at the University of Stavanger (UiS), {{department}} of Industrial Economics, Risk Management and Planning, {{during the spring}} of 2017. The idea behind stems from interests in oil price changes and how the Norwegian economy is affected by it. The aim for this paper is to study the impact of oil price fluctuations on the Oslo Stock Exchange benchmark index (OSEBX), by investigating the changes in the crude oil price for the period from 2001 to 2016. Since Norway is built on oil richness, it’s stock markets are likely to be susceptible to oil price shocks. Regression analysis is used to analyze the relationship among the variables. It is generally <b>accepted</b> that <b>oil</b> has been vitally important for the global economy, and the world has experienced growth in consumption for the majority of years since the 1900 s. The global importance of oil is likely to continue {{in the years to come}} as well. Oil is the world’s primary fuel, and demand is ever-growing. In 2015, there was about 1. 2 billion passenger cars in the world, and over 98 % of them relied on oil. This number is expected to grow in the years to come. Increasing number of vehicles has an obvious influence on the demand for gasoline and diesel fuel. Engineers stated in 2015 that only 12 % of the 9 trillion barrels of oil in place globally has been extracted yet (Clemente, 2015). Oil is the main reason the world is globalized, and its importance will continue in the following years. The fact that oil price movements have been a subject of discussion for centuries is one of the factors driving me to write this thesis. Economists and policy makers have shown increasing concerns regarding speculation and extreme oil price movements. Production and exportation of oil and gas are important parts of the Norwegian economy, and should therefore have a strong effect on the stock market. In the long run, we see that there is a strong correlation between the changes in the oil price and the changes in the OSEBX. When studying four different short-run periods, we see that the correlation is low for all periods except the last. Generally, the OSEBX can just to some extent be said to be driven by the oil price. Other external factors are driving the changes. The overall conclusion is that the oil price has a positive effect on the OSEBX index. Only indexes related to the oil market will be significantly influenced by changes in the price of oil...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{existence}} of one global vegetable oil market. We analyze the historic price developments in the period 2000 {{until the end of}} 2015 of fish oil, soybean oil, groundnut oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, corn oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil and linseed oil. The existence of one market can be investigated by the means of Johansen cointegration tests. There is statistical evidence which suggests that there is a strong relationship among the oils in the long-run. The quality of the oils and which end-users the oils have, are the main factors which cause the degree of integration. The general oils (soybean, sunflower, rapeseed and palm oil) which are close substitutes in the cooking and margarine manufacturing are cointegrated over the full period. In addition, the law of one price is <b>accepted</b> for these <b>oils.</b> Tests of all ten oils as in one system rejects the law of one price, but suggests cointegration in the long-run. The lauric oils, coconut and palm kernel oil, are considered as cointegrated and forms a separate sub-market within the global vegetable oil market. Hence, the degree of market integration is strongly linked to the qualities of the oils. Fish oil has risen to become a premium oil compared to the other vegetable oils. During the commodity boom era, fish oil formed a stationary linear relationship with rapeseed oil. The observed integration between the two {{can be explained by the}} degree of substitution of fish oil by rapeseed oil as input in salmon feed – fish oil and rapeseed oil was substitutes in this period, despite fish oil’s premium qualities as a source of Omega- 3. There is a break around June 2011 which caused rapeseed oil (and the other vegetable oils) to diverge from fish oil. The high price of fish oil in the recent years is deemed as a result of high demand of fish oil in a new Omega- 3 market for human consumption. Thus, fish oil is no longer considered as integrated with the vegetable oils. The high prices of fish oil has caused the salmon feed costs to increase, as fish oil is an important input in the feed. The demand of fish oil is believed to be high in the future, both from the aquaculture industry and the Omega- 3 market. Therefore, we believe that the price of fish oil will be traded at premium compared to the vegetable oils in the future...|$|R
40|$|It is now {{well-known}} that n- 3 polyunsaturated {{fatty acids}} (omega- 3 PUFA) have beneficial effects on health {{but are also}} rapidly oxidized in potentially toxic compounds, which means that healthy food products, rich in n- 3 PUFA, can become toxic for the consumer if not stored or processed appropriately. The main objective of this work was to develop new analytical tools to study markers of lipids alteration in food, {{in order to allow}} an adequate monitoring of possible toxic compounds in n- 3 PUFA rich food products. 	The first chapter of this PhD thesis is a literature review about fatty acids, their oxidation and the different oxidation products generated. The different analytical techniques used to study the oxidative stability of polyunsaturated fatty acids and their degradation products in food are also described. Chapter 2 describes the development of a gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method to analyze the fatty acids in food. The method was applied to eggs and pork (both standard and n- 3 enriched) submitted to various cooking processes and storage conditions. This study confirmed that the fat of standard eggs or pork from the Belgian market cannot be considered as a source ofn- 3 PUFA [...] Indeed, in this work, we measured no n- 3 PUFA in meat or only around 2 % for eggs, while the fat of both enriched eggs and pork contained about 10 % of n- 3 fatty acids. After storage or cooking without culinary fat no change of the fatty acid profile was observed, in standard eggs or pork. We made the same observation for n- 3 enriched products, except for some cooking processes (pan-frying and oven cooking), which induced a slight but significant loss of n- 3 fatty acids in n- 3 enriched eggs or pork. The fairly stable behavior of the fatty acids after various cooking and storage experiments indicates that the fatty acid profile is not a good marker of lipid alteration. As a consequence, this work was oriented to the development of analytical tools to evaluate the presence of toxic aldehydes in food and feed as secondary oxidation products coming from polyunsaturated fatty acids. 	Chapter 3 is dedicated {{to the study of the}} oxidative stability of linseed oil, an oil rich in n- 3 fatty acids. Section 3. 1 describes the development of a liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to evaluate the aldehyde content in linseed oil. After optimisation of the extraction, derivation, detection and quantification steps, the method was validated according to guidelines from the European legislation as well as the recommendations of the AFNOR protocol NF V 03 - 110 (AFNOR, 2010). The evaluated parameters included specificity/selectivity, recovery, precision, accuracy, uncertainty, limits of detection and quantification, determined using the concept of accuracy profiles. When the method was applied to first pressure linseed oil stored for several days at 60 °C according to the Schaal oven test, it was shown that 4 -hydroxy- 2 E-hexenal (4 -HHE) was the most produced aldehyde. In Section 3. 2, the different patterns of oxidation of linseed oil in real-time and accelerated aging assays were investigated, in order to verify the hypothesis commonly <b>accepted</b> for vegetal <b>oil</b> that one day aging at 60 °C is equivalent to one month real time aging at room temperature. Oxidation was evaluated with the peroxide value and para-anisidine value, as well as the content in conjugated dienes and aldehydes. All four indicators of oxidation showed very different kinetic behaviours at 20 and 60 °C, showing that the hypothesis (1 day at 60 °C = 1 month at 20 °C) is not valid for linseed oil. 	Chapter 4 describes the adaptation and the validation of a LC-MS/MS method to determine aldehydes in animal feed samples. Indeed, as animal feed is often enriched with linseed to increase the human intake of n- 3 fatty acids through the consumption of food from animal origin, the study of the oxidative stability of n- 3 enriched animal feed is also of interest. To achieve that goal, the LC-MS/MS method previously developed for linseed oil was adapted to include more aldehydes and was validated using the same guidelines as in section 3. 1. 	Finally, chapter 5 presents the discussion and conclusions about the developed methods and the results obtained as well as their comparison with literature. Future prospects to improve the evaluation of and the exposure to the markers of lipid alteration in food are proposed...|$|R
