We experiment using several media applications on a custom architecture, a generic VLIW architecture and a RISC architecture, all three with several cores. Our results show that defining the problem with constraints gives flexibility in modelling, while state-of-the-art constraint solvers enable optimal solutions for large problems, hinting a new method for code generation...|$|R

As the core of a four-chip set, this central processing unit would not only meet Busicom’s calculator needs, but could be plugged into a variety of applications without the need for redesign.

In a decision that would change history, Intel designed a general-purpose logic chip that could be programmed to take instructions. The 4004 was Intel's first microprocessor.

This paper describes a new approach to generate <b>application</b> specific <b>instructions</b> for DSP <b>applications.</b> The proposed approach is based on a modified subset-sum problem, and can support multi-cycle complex instructions as well as single cycle instructions, while the previous state-of-the-art approaches can generate only the single-cycle instructions or can just select instructions from the fixed super-set of possible instructions. In addition, the proposed approach can also be applicable to the case that instructions are predefined. The experimental results on real applications show that the proposed approach is ef-fective in making the instructions meet the given constraints without attaching special hardware accelerators. ...|$|R
