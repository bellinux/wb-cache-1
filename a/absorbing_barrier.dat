40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} the {{first passage time}} and the multifractal for two kinds of absorbing ions, K+ and Na+, on a charged lipid membrane. We introduce the first passage time arriving {{for the first time}} at the <b>absorbing</b> <b>barrier</b> after starting from an arbitrary barrier. The first passage time for the random walk is the statistical quantity that defines the average time arriving at the <b>absorbing</b> <b>barrier</b> for the first time. For two ions of Na+ and K+, the first passage time distributions are approximately proportional to power laws with scaling exponent- 1. 5, and our result is shown to be in consistent with theoretical one. We also simulate and analyze the multifractal behavior from the charged ions arrived {{for the first time at}} an <b>absorbing</b> <b>barrier.</b> In future, we will extend the various investigation of multifractals to complicated stochastic models of other charged ions.

40|$|We {{report a}} quantitative, {{analytical}} and numerical, comparison between two {{models of the}} interaction of a non-relativistic quantum particle with a thin time-dependent <b>absorbing</b> <b>barrier.</b> The first model represents the barrier {{by a set of}} time-dependent discontinuous matching conditions, which are closely related to Kottler boundary conditions used in stationary wave optics as a mathematical basis for Kirchhoff diffraction theory. The second model mimics the <b>absorbing</b> <b>barrier</b> with an off-diagonal δ-potential with a time-dependent amplitude. We show that the two models of absorption agree in their predictions in a semiclassical regime [...] the regime readily accessible in modern experiments with ultracold atoms.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, mater-wave {{interferometry}} has attracted growing attention {{due to its}} unique suitability for high-precision measurements and study of fundamental aspects of quantum theory. Diffraction and interference of matter waves can be observed not only at a spatial aperture (such as a screen edge, slit, or grating), but also at a time-domain aperture (such as an <b>absorbing</b> <b>barrier,</b> or "shutter", that is being periodically switched on and off). The wave phenomenon of the latter type is {{commonly referred to as}} "diffraction in time". Here, we introduce a versatile, exactly solvable model of diffraction in time. It describes time-evolution of an arbitrary initial quantum state {{in the presence of a}} time-dependent <b>absorbing</b> <b>barrier,</b> governed by an arbitrary aperture function.

The natural formulation of the problems to be solved here is in terms of random walks. For (i) the random walk Ym(.) takes place in a triangle in a 2 -dimensional lattice space with two reflecting barriers along the axes (a deletion takes no effect on an empty stacks and one <b>absorbing</b> <b>barrier</b> parallel to the second diagonal (the algerithm stops when the combined sizes of the stacks exhaust the available storage). For (ii) the random walk takes place in a rectangle with breaked corner and has four reflecting barriers and one <b>absorbing</b> <b>barrier</b> (see Figure 8). With the help of diffusions techniques, we obtain, asymptotically: - the hitting place (Zm) and time (Tm) distributions on the absorbing boundary - the joined distribution of Zm and Tm- the distribution P[Ym(n) <ym, n<Tm) The two stacks problem has been partially investigated by Yao [17] and more recently by Flajolet [7] with different tools.
