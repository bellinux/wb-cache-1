5|$|In 2006, Tecmo and Sony {{announced}} {{the development of}} Ninja Gaiden Sigma for the PS3. Eidos obtained the European publishing rights for this game. Itagaki had no direct role in Sigma and judged it <b>a</b> <b>flawed</b> game, although he acknowledged that Sigma gave PlayStation owners a taste of Ninja Gaiden. A version for PlayStation Vita, titled Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus, was released in North America and Europe on February 22, 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{author of}} the change which {{introduced}} Heartbleed, Robin Seggelmann, stated that he missed validating a variable containing a length and denied any intention to submit <b>a</b> <b>flawed</b> implementation. Following Heartbleed's disclosure, Seggelmann suggested focusing on the second aspect, stating that OpenSSL is not reviewed by enough people. Although Seggelmann's work was reviewed by an OpenSSL core developer, the review was also intended to verify functional improvements, a situation making vulnerabilities much easier to miss.|$|E
5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as <b>a</b> <b>flawed</b> response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited {{as a result of the}} Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E
50|$|The Poisson {{process can}} be used to measure the rates at which {{different}} people find security flaws between open and closed source software. The {{process can be}} broken down by the number of volunteers Nv and paid reviewers Np. The rates at which volunteers find <b>a</b> <b>flaw</b> is measured by λv and the rate that paid reviewers find <b>a</b> <b>flaw</b> is measured by λp. The expected time that a volunteer group is expected to find <b>a</b> <b>flaw</b> is 1/(Nv λv) and the expected time that a paid group is expected to find <b>a</b> <b>flaw</b> is 1/(Np λp).|$|R

5|$|Released in {{competition}} with Half-Life 2 and several other titles, Bloodlines sold fewer than 80,000 copies during its initial release, which was considered a poor performance. It divided critics at the time; although they praised the game's writing and scale of choice, they criticized its technical flaws. It was Troika Games' last production before its failure in early 2005, when it was unable to secure additional projects. The game has a cult following as a rarely replicated example of gameplay and narrative, and contemporary reception recognised it as <b>a</b> <b>flawed</b> masterpiece. Since its original release in 2004, Bloodlines received post-release support from fans, supplying unofficial fixes and re-adding unused content.|$|E
5|$|Vast {{numbers of}} {{contract}} tablets, dated to the reigns of Hammurabi and his successors, have been discovered, {{as well as}} 55 of his own letters. These letters give {{a glimpse into the}} daily trials of ruling an empire, from dealing with floods and mandating changes to <b>a</b> <b>flawed</b> calendar, to taking care of Babylon's massive herds of livestock. Hammurabi died and passed the reins of the empire on to his son Samsu-iluna in c. 1750 BC, under whose rule the Babylonian empire began to quickly unravel.|$|E
5|$|In the manga Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Beveridge liked Sasuke's personality, {{particularly}} {{as it was}} presented during his dialogue with Naruto. Reviewing the anime adaptation, Sam Stewart from IGN was particularly impressed by the scenes between Sasuke and Sarada, most notably because of changes in Sasuke's characterization. He highlights that despite acting coldly towards his daughter, he ends up using his body as a shield {{to protect her from}} his enemy. Ken Iikura from Anime Now agreed, pointing out that Sasuke has become a loving husband and father in Boruto, despite retaining some of the dark aspects of his personality. Ikikura noted that Sasuke and Sarada's meeting in Boruto significantly developed both characters. McNulty disliked the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series, because she felt it was initially an one-sided crush on Sakura's part, but she believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden expanded on the bond between the two and their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Stewart praised Sasuke's portrayal as <b>a</b> <b>flawed</b> parent rather than an effortlessly good one, noting that his farewell to Sarada demonstrated his difficulty with being a good father. Another writer from Anime Now, Sarah Nelkin, noted that these episodes helped to develop Sasuke as both a father and a husband, especially when he explains to Sarada that she creates a bond between him and Sakura that persists despite his being frequently absent {{as a result of his}} mission.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{discusses}} {{the applicability of}} eddy current testing to the non-destructive evaluation of the depth of <b>a</b> <b>flaw.</b> Three-dimensional finite element simulations are carried out to calculate eddy current signals due to <b>a</b> <b>flaw,</b> and subsequent calculations correlate the difference between signals due to two flaws with {{the difference between the}} depths of the flaws. Standard deviation of the difference between the depths of the flaws is used to discuss the ill-posedness of the problem. <b>A</b> <b>flaw</b> is modeled as a sufficiently long rectangular region with a constant width and uniform electrical conductivity; an absolute pancake probe is considered. This study reveals that lift-off and coil diameter do not have a large effect on the ill-posedness, which supports that it is reasonable to decide parameters in actual inspections so that signal-to-noise ratio is maximized. The results obtained also indicate the difficulty in evaluating the depth of <b>a</b> <b>flaw</b> deeper than 1 mm using the signals obtained using an absolute pancake probe...|$|R

25|$|Two {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out to assess the evidence for SRA. In the United States, evidence was reported but was based on <b>a</b> <b>flawed</b> methodology with an overly liberal definition of a substantiated case. In the United Kingdom, a government report produced no evidence of SRA, but several examples of false satanists faking rituals to frighten their victims.|$|E

The Snapists believe that Rowling has misinterpreted Snape and disrespected him as a character. They also feel that Snape can contact them and provide them with help and guidance in life.|$|E
25|$|Namco's staff created Luke to be <b>a</b> <b>flawed</b> person who, {{despite being}} unlikable {{because of his}} personality, would mature across the game. He was {{designed}} by Kōsuke Fujishima who wanted his appearance to show his laziness, a sense of fashion, {{as well as the}} fact he practises martial arts. He has been voiced in Japanese by Chihiro Suzuki and in English by Yuri Lowenthal.|$|E

It was {{intended}} to be used with the Short Sunderland in Royal Air Force Coastal Command but it was <b>a</b> <b>flawed</b> design and only a small number were built. They had a poor service record and a high accident rate; of 21 aircraft, 10 were lost to accidents and one for an unknown reason.|$|E

25|$|The first {{generation}} iPod Nano may overheat and pose a {{health and safety}} risk. Affected iPod Nanos were sold between September 2005 and December 2006. This is due to <b>a</b> <b>flawed</b> battery used by Apple from a single battery manufacturer. Apple recommended that owners of affected iPod Nanos stop using them. Under an Apple product replacement program, affected Nanos were replaced with current generation Nanos free of charge.|$|E
25|$|Mickey {{generally}} appears {{alongside his}} girlfriend Minnie Mouse, his pet dog Pluto, his friends Donald Duck and Goofy, and his nemesis Pete, among others (see Mickey Mouse universe). Though originally {{characterized as a}} mischievous antihero, Mickey was rebranded over time as an everyman, usually seen as <b>a</b> <b>flawed,</b> but adventurous hero. In 2009, Disney began to rebrand the character again by putting less emphasis on his pleasant, cheerful side and reintroducing the more mischievous and adventurous sides of his personality, beginning with the video game Epic Mickey.|$|E
25|$|Valentinian Gnosticism {{may have}} been monistic rather than dualistic. In the Valentinian myths, the {{creation}} of <b>a</b> <b>flawed</b> materiality is not due to any moral failing {{on the part of}} the Demiurge, but due to the fact that he is less perfect than the superior entities from which he emanated. Valentinians treat physical reality with less contempt than other Gnostic groups, and conceive of materiality not as a separate substance from the divine, but as attributable to an error of perception which becomes symbolized mythopoetically as the act of material creation.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, Allmand defended a legal argument, {{on behalf}} of the World Federalist Movement – Canada, that {{challenged}} the Canadian government's implementation bill for the Convention on Cluster Munitions. He argued that a clause of the bill was flawed and enabled use of cluster munitions while Canada was participating in combined military operations with allies. Participating in use was a violation of the primary purposes of the convention. Allmand preferred not signing the treaty than passing <b>a</b> <b>flawed</b> version that with a loophole that other countries could also adopt to circumvent its terms.|$|E
25|$|Another theory {{claims that}} there was {{deliberate}} misinformation {{on the part of}} the Anglo-French team. The main thrust of this theory was that the Anglo-French team knew that the Soviet team was planning to steal the design plans of the Concorde, and the Soviets were allegedly passed false blueprints with <b>a</b> <b>flawed</b> design. The case, it is claimed, contributed to the imprisonment by the Soviets of Greville Wynne in 1963 for spying. Wynne was imprisoned on 11 May 1963 and the development of the Tu-144 was not sanctioned until 16 July.|$|E
25|$|Korolev's {{successor}} in the Soviet {{space program}} was Vasily Mishin, a quite competent engineer {{who had served}} as his deputy and right-hand man. After Korolev died, Mishin became the Chief Designer, and he inherited {{what turned out to}} be <b>a</b> <b>flawed</b> N1 rocket program. In 1972, Mishin was fired and then replaced by a rival, Valentin Glushko, after all four N-1 test launches failed. By that time, the rival Americans had already made it to the Moon, and so the program was canceled by CPSU General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev.|$|E
