40|$|The letter {{reports on}} upconverted orange (607. 5 nm, P- 3 (0) [...] >H- 3 (6)) and red (638. 7 nm, P- 3 (0) [...] >F- 3 (2)) laser {{oscillation}} {{at room temperature}} observed in Pr 3 +,Yb 3 +:BaY 2 F 8 under excitation at 822 or 841 nm at 300 K. The upconversion mechanism that populates the emitting level is an <b>avalanche</b> <b>excitation</b> mechanism. Output powers up to 55 mW and slope efficiencies up to 27 % were demonstrated at 607. 5 nm. At 638. 7 nm, the maximum output power was 26 mW with a slope efficiency of about 13. 5 %.

40|$|Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) {{is shown}} to mediate the {{splitting}} of LnVO(4) (Ln = Ce and Nd) nanocrystals from rods to sheaves and to spherulites under hydrothermal conditions with remarkable controllability and uniformity. The roles of EDTA {{are thought to be}} to (1) chelate the Ln(3 +) ions in solution, thus decreasing the nanocrystal nucleation rate but increasing the growth rate, and (2) interfere with the nanocrystal growth by capping the nanocrystal surfaces. Upconverted avalanche luminescence from LnVO(4) nanoplates, nanowires, and straw-nanosheaves has been demonstrated and compared. We found that the LnVO(4) strawsheaves have a relatively more efficient upconversion due to the smaller <b>avalanche</b> <b>excitation</b> threshold caused by the strong cross-relaxation between the bundled nanorods in the sheaves...|$|E
40|$|We {{report an}} {{experimental}} {{investigation of the}} facilitated excitation dynamics in off-resonantly driven Rydberg gases by separating the initial off-resonant excitation phase from the facilitation phase, in which successive facilitation events lead to <b>excitation</b> <b>avalanches.</b> We achieve this by creating a controlled number of initial seed excitations. Greater insight into the avalanche mechanism is obtained from {{an analysis of the}} full counting distributions. We also present simple mathematical models and numerical simulations of the <b>excitation</b> <b>avalanches</b> that agree well with our experimental results...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study on pre-breakdown light emission in low-pressure argon gas was performed. In a pulsed discharge, pre-breakdown phenomena were observed for repetition rates between 100 and 2000 Hz and pulse duration of 100 ¿s. These phenomena were studied with time-resolved emission imaging using an intensified {{charge coupled device}} camera. The origin of the pre-breakdown emission was identified as diffusion of volume charges left over from previous discharges. These charges were accelerated towards the anode in small electron <b>avalanches</b> causing <b>excitation</b> of argon atoms. Different spatial distributions of the pre-breakdown light emission for different times between discharges were measured {{and the effects of}} the pre-breakdown phenomena on the main breakdown phase were studied using a double voltage pulse. The observed effects were attributed to the distribution of volume charges, left over from previous discharges, in the discharge gap during the pre-breakdown phase...|$|R
40|$|Cognitive {{tasks are}} {{represented}} in a network, in which: - Nodes correspond to cell-assemblies with a critical threshold, which enables explanation of various psychological phenomena, like priming. - Dynamical network states (excitation loops) can propagate in specific, task-dependent ways ranging from singular chains to <b>avalanches</b> of <b>excitation.</b> - Temporary connections (binding) ensure the theoretically necessary, rapid, serial coupling of separate neural excitation patterns, corresponding at the cognitive level to binding of location, identity, rank-order, and task knowledge. Computer simulations of the network and empirical evidence for hypotheses on the critical threshold and serial binding show {{the viability of the}} model in the study of letter- and word recognition, change-blindness, and meta-cognition involving the tip-of-the-tongue state. The representation of several tasks within a single neural architecture produces constraints for the study and simulation of the architecture’s autonomous development. This is a necessary step in the search for biologically plausible mechanisms and conditions of cognitive self-organisation...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{behaviour}} of the ionization avalanche in an ensemble of ultracold 87 Rb atoms coupled to a high lying Rydberg state and investigate extensions to the current model by including the effects of three-body recombination and plasma expansion. To separate the two effects we study the time dependence of the plasma formation at various densities {{as well as for}} different nS and nD states. At medium densities and low n we observe the onset of the avalanche as has been reported in other experiments, as well as a subsequent turn-off of the <b>avalanche</b> for longer <b>excitation</b> times, which we associate with plasma expansion. At higher densities and for higher lying Rydberg states we observe a disappearance of the avalanche signature, which we attribute to three-body recombination. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of excited electronic states of Ni 2 + doped into CsCdCl 3, KZnF 3 and KMgF 3 are studied using optical spectroscopy. A very intense and sharp line {{is found in}} the low-temperature excited state excitation spectrum at 701. 7, 710. 7 and 706. 0 nm in the above crystals, respectively. These lines are assigned to different zero phonon transitions in the three lattices: 3 T 2 g [...] > 1 A 1 g in CsCdCl 3 :Ni 2 + and 3 T 2 g [...] > 1 T 2 g in KZnF 3 :Ni 2 + and KMgF 3 :Ni 2 +. This difference is explained by the lack of an inversion centre in the C 3 v site of CsCdCl 3 :Ni 2 + in contrast to the two fluoride lattices which have O(h) site symmetry. The energies and the distortions of the excited states along totally symmetric and Jahn-Teller coordinates are discussed. The differences in these distortions are correlated with the <b>excitation</b> <b>avalanche</b> effect...|$|R
40|$|These authors made equal {{contributions}} to this work. Due {{to a number}} of recent technological advances, a hand-held flow cytometer can be achieved by use of semiconductor illuminators, optical sensors (all battery powered) and sensitive cell markers such as immuno-quantum dot (Qdot) labels. The specific application described is of a handheld blood analyzer that can quickly process a drop of whole, unfractionated human peripheral blood by real-time, on-chip magnetic separation of white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs) and further fluorescence analysis of Qdot labeled WBC subsets. Various microfluidic patterns were fabricated in PDMS and used to characterize flow of single cells and magnetic deflection of magnetically labeled cells. An LED <b>excitation,</b> <b>avalanche</b> photodiode detection system (SensL Technologies, Ltd., Cork, Ireland) was used for immuno-Qdot detection of WBC subsets. A static optical setup was used to determine the sensitivity of the detection system. In this work we demonstrate: valve-less, on-chip magnetic sorting of immunomagnetically labeled white blood cells, bright Qdot labeling of lymphocytes, and counting of labeled white blood cells. Comparisons of these results with conventional flow cytometric analyses are reported. Sample preparation efficiency was determined by labeling of isolated white blood cells. Appropriate flow rates were determined for optical detection and confirmed with flowing particles. Several enabling technologies required for a truly portable, battery powered, hand-held flow cytometer for use in future point-of-care diagnostic devices have been demonstrated. The combining of these technologies into an integrated hand-held instrument is in progress and results on whole blood cell analysis are to be reported in another paper...|$|R
