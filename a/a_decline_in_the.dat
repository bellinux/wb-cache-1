5000|$|<b>In</b> North America, <b>the</b> {{recession}} {{immediately following}} World War I was extremely brief, lasting for only 7 months from August 1918 to March 1919. [...] A second, much more severe recession, sometimes labeled a depression, began in January 1920. Several indices {{of economic activity}} suggest the recession was moderately severe. The Axe-Houghton Index of Index of Trade and Industrial Activity <b>declined</b> by 14.1% <b>in</b> this recession (compared to <b>a</b> 31% <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Panic of 1907).

5|$|A beefsteak {{is a type}} of banquet {{in which}} sliced beef {{tenderloin}} is served to diners as all-you-can-eat finger food. The dining style originated in 19th-century New York City as a type of working-class celebration but went into <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-20th century. Resurrected by caterers in New Jersey, the beefsteak banquet style is now popular in that state's Bergen and Passaic counties, and is enjoying a revival in New York City, where the style originated, due to the reemergence of a biannual beefsteak in Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1890s, {{the logging}} of native timber {{expanded}} into new areas made accessible by {{an extension of}} the railway, before petering out in the mid-20th century. One nail in the industry's coffin came with a series of bushfires which destroyed several mills in 1935. The cleared land was used primarily for pastoral sheep and dairy farming, which continues to be a mainstay of the Catlins' economy. Much of the remaining forest is now protected by the Department of Conservation as part of the Catlins Conservation Park.|$|E
5|$|After {{suffering}} a foot injury {{at the start}} of 1986–87, Gibbs was restricted to 18 appearances as his team finished the season 9th in the First Division. However, the departure of Graham Taylor and arrival of Dave Bassett the following season signalled <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> club's fortunes. Gibbs lost his place shortly before Bassett's departure in January, and although he soon returned to the side under Steve Harrison, Watford were relegated in 1988. At the time of the club's relegation, Gibbs had made precisely 100 First Division appearances.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from around}} 50 songs, Meyerbeer wrote little {{except for the}} stage. The {{critical}} assaults of Wagner and his supporters, especially after his death, led to <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> popularity of his works; his operas were suppressed by the Nazi regime in Germany, and were neglected by opera houses {{through most of the}} twentieth century. In the 21st century, however, the composer's major French grand operas have begun to reappear in the repertory of numerous European opera houses.|$|E

5|$|Between World WarI and World WarII Australia {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} the Great Depression {{which started in}} 1929.

In 1931, the Statute of Westminster granted the Australian government independence in foreign affairs and defence. Nevertheless, from the mid-1930s, Australian governments generally followed British policy towards Nazi Germany, supporting first the appeasement of Hitler and the British guarantee of Polish independence.|$|E
5|$|By 1959, {{the pattern}} of {{commuter}} services at Herne Hill had taken the shape it held into the 21st century: all-stops trains from Victoria to Orpington and from the City of London to Wimbledon and Sutton (but, unlike the modern Sutton Loop, via West Croydon). However, there was <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of electric trains on the Chatham Main Line through Herne Hill {{in the years after}} the war. Immediately after electrification in 1925, six trains used the route between Herne Hill and Shortlands in each direction during every off-peak hour. By 1960, it had dropped to two trains in each direction.|$|E
5|$|Despite its name, Old Louisville was {{actually}} {{built as a}} suburb of Louisville starting in the 1870s, nearly a century after Louisville was founded.

Old Louisville was initially {{home to some of}} Louisville's wealthiest residents, but saw <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early and mid-20th century. Following revitalization efforts and gentrification, Old Louisville is currently home to a diverse population with a high concentration of students and young professionals.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{benefits}} of the Project, many CVP operations have had considerable environmental consequences, including <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> salmon population of four major California rivers, and the reduction of riparian zones and wetlands. Many historical sites and Native American tribal lands have been flooded by CVP reservoirs. In addition, runoff from intensive irrigation has polluted rivers and groundwater. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act, passed in 1992, intends to alleviate some of the problems associated with the CVP with programs like the Refuge Water Supply Program.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{new housing}} estates were built north-west of the town. This was {{followed}} by the redevelopment of the town centre in the 1960s and 1970s, which destroyed much of the old high street. There was speculation that the town's population could increase to around 55–60,000 by 1970. This did not happen: <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> linoleum industry in the mid-1960s led to a decrease in population, from a peak of 53,750 in 1961 to 47,962 in 1981.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Newfoundland pony {{was used}} for ploughing, {{assisting}} with gardens, hauling kelp from the beaches, gathering hay, and carrying wood, and they were also used for transportation. They were successfully used and bred to withstand the hard climate, and by 1935 there were over 9,000 ponies on the island. During the mid-20th century, however, increasing mechanization and a ban on free-roaming ponies contributed to <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> population, and increased exports to France for horse meat in the 1970s almost led to the extinction of the breed.|$|E

5|$|Many academics, {{including}} William Holdsworth, a man {{considered to}} be one of the best legal academics in history, maintain that this period saw <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> standard of teaching at all the Inns. From 1640 onwards no readings were held, and barristers such as Sir Edward Coke remarked at the time that the quality of education at the Inns of Court had decreased. Holdsworth put this down to three things—the introduction of printed books, the disinclination of students to attend moots and readings and the disinclination of the Benchers and Readers to enforce attendance.|$|E
