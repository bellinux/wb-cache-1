5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, <b>a</b> <b>butterfly</b> {{was seen}} in Japan as the {{personification}} of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if <b>a</b> <b>butterfly</b> enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E

5|$|Among the insects, in both Japan and Europe, as {{far back}} as ancient Greece and Rome, <b>a</b> <b>butterfly</b> was seen as the {{personification}} of a person's soul, both while they were alive and after their death. The scarab beetle was sacred in ancient Egypt, while the praying mantis was considered a god in southern African Khoi and San tradition for its praying posture.|$|E
5|$|As {{discussed}} above, any non-pseudoforest graph contains as a subgraph a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or theta graph; any handcuff or figure 8 graph may be contracted to form <b>a</b> <b>butterfly</b> graph (five-vertex figure 8), and any theta graph may be contracted {{to form a}} diamond graph (four-vertex theta graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either <b>a</b> <b>butterfly</b> or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are the}} only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond but not the butterfly, the resulting larger graph family consists of the cactus graphs and disjoint unions of multiple cactus graphs.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} English {{translation}} of 1847 by Mary Howitt, the tale {{opens with a}} beggar woman giving a peasant's wife a barleycorn in exchange for food. Once planted, a tiny girl, Thumbelina (Tommelise), emerges from its flower. One night, Thumbelina, asleep in her walnut-shell cradle, is carried off by a toad who wants her as a bride for her son. With the help of friendly fish and <b>a</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Thumbelina escapes the toad and her son, and drifts on a lily pad until captured by a stag beetle who later discards her when his friends reject her company.|$|E
5|$|Like all animal heads, {{the head}} of <b>a</b> <b>butterfly</b> or moth {{contains}} the feeding organs and the major sense organs. The head typically consists of two antennae, two compound eyes, two palpi and a proboscis. Lepidoptera have ocelli {{which may or may}} not be visible. They also have sensory structures called chaetosemata, the functions of which are largely unknown. The head is filled largely by the brain, the sucking pump and its associated muscle bundles. Unlike the adults, the larvae have one-segmented mandibles.|$|E
