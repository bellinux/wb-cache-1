5|$|John McFall (born 25 April 1981) is a Cardiff-based British Paralympic sprinter. In 2000, {{when he was}} 19 years old, {{his right}} leg was amputated <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> {{following}} a serious motorcycle accident. He took up running again after being fitted with a prosthesis, and participated in his first race in 2004. The following year, he was selected to represent Great Britain at the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) European Championships, and took the bronze medal in the 200metres (sport class T42).|$|E
5|$|Ellie Victoria Cole {{was born}} in the Melbourne suburb of Lilydale on 12 December 1991. Her mother and {{grandfather}} were both swimmers, and her father was athletic. At two years of age, she was diagnosed with a rare tumour, a sarcoma that was wrapped around the nerves of her right leg. After unsuccessful attempts to treat her cancer with chemotherapy, her right leg was amputated <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> on 14 February 1994. Eight weeks after the surgery, as part of her rehabilitation, Cole's mother Jenny enrolled her in swimming lessons. Cole's instructors expected her to take up to a year to learn how to swim in a straight line, but it took her two weeks.|$|E
5|$|The promotional cinema {{poster for}} the film {{featured}} a woman holding a crossbow; she was photographed from behind, and her outfit left {{the bottom half of}} her buttocks exposed. The effect was achieved by having the model wear a pair of bikini bottoms backwards, so that the part seen on her backside is actually the front of the suit. The poster caused some furore—largely in the US—with The Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times considering the poster so unsuitable they edited out everything <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> whilst the Pittsburgh Press editors painted a pair of shorts over the legs. There was significant speculation as to the identity of the model before photographer Morgan Kane identified her as Joyce Bartle.|$|E

5|$|Tinker {{had serious}} health {{problems}} in his later life. Complications of diabetes mellitus and Bright's disease left Tinker near death in 1936, when his physician believed he had 24 hours to live, and 1944, when he was placed in an oxygen tent. However, he returned to health and scouted minor league players for the Boston Braves in 1946. Tinker developed an infection relating to diabetes that in 1947 required the amputation of a toe and persisted until his left leg <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> was amputated as well. Tinker died at Orange Memorial Hospital in Orlando on July 27, 1948, his 68th birthday, of complications from diabetes. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery and survived by his four children.|$|E
5|$|With his sprinting prosthesis, McFall began {{training}} with an ex-Paralympian. In early 2005 former Welsh international athlete Darrell Maynard {{took over as}} his coach and he began {{training with}} an able-bodied squad. He was selected to represent Great Britain at the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) European Championships {{which took place in}} August 2005 in Espoo, Finland, a decision that greatly surprised him as he had not achieved the qualifying standard in races that summer. In the Championships, his first international competition, he took the bronze medal in the 200metres and came fourth in the 100-metre race, having competed in sport class T42 (single amputation <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee).</b> McFall was subsequently placed on a funding programme, enabling him to become a full-time athlete.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, Keenor {{was badly}} wounded when {{a piece of}} {{artillery}} shrapnel struck his left leg <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> on 28 July, leaving him unable to walk. An unknown soldier saw Keenor attempting to crawl away from the incoming fire and managed to assist {{him back to the}} nearby medical facilities where doctors were able to tend to his injury. The wound was so severe that army doctors debated the idea of amputating the leg but decided against the idea. He was removed from the Western Front, being transported to an army hospital in Dublin where he spent six months undergoing rehabilitation on his injured leg. Following his return to service, Keenor was stationed in Chatham, Kent as a fitness instructor for the 5th Reserve Brigade. He was later promoted to the rank of sergeant and was awarded the Victory Medal, the 1914–15 Star and the British War Medal for his service during the war. Between 1915 and 1919, Keenor appeared as a guest for Brentford in the London Combination.|$|E

50|$|A bondage corset is very long, rigid, and restricting. It is {{constructed}} to place severe {{limitations on the}} wearer's movements. It generally extends to just <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees,</b> and {{is constructed}} to be laced very tightly.|$|R
50|$|A {{picket line}} is a {{horizontal}} rope, along which horses are tied at intervals. The rope {{can be on the}} ground, at chest height (<b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees,</b> below <b>the</b> neck), or overhead. The overhead form usually is called a high line.|$|R
5|$|John McFall {{was born}} on 25 April 1981 in Frimley, Surrey, in England. Between 1994 and 1997 he {{attended}} school at Millfield in Street, Somerset, where as a teenager he was a runner and hockey player. In August 2000 while on a gap-year trip to Ko Samui, Thailand, after his A-levels, {{he was involved in}} a serious motorcycle accident. While riding a moped, he went round a corner too quickly and skidded. He put out his leg to stop the motorcycle from falling over, and smashed his knee. The motorcycle then fell on him, resulting in the chain severing major blood vessels in his leg. He was flown to a hospital in Bangkok, but as he had damaged his lower right leg too severely, it had to be amputated <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> after three days. Upon returning to the UK, he spent about seven weeks undergoing rehabilitation at Queen Mary's Hospital in Roehampton, London.|$|E
5|$|The small {{saphenous vein}} (SSV), {{runs along the}} {{posterior}} aspect of the leg {{as far as the}} popliteal region, in the upper calf. Here it enters the popliteal space which is located between the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle where it usually drains <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint in the popliteal vein or a little less often in the great saphenous vein (GSV) or other deep muscular veins of the thigh. The use of ultrasonography has allowed a number of variations to be shown at this level; when no contact is made with the popliteal vein it might be seen to drain in the GSV, at a variable level; or, it may merge with the Giacomini vein and drain in the GSV at the superior 1/3 of the thigh. It can also but rarely, drain in the vein of the semimembranosus (thigh muscle) (shown below). Usually though, it connects with a perforator vein at its middle 1/3. To check for insufficiency, the Paraná maneuver is very useful.|$|E

50|$|The shendyt was a kilt-like garment worn {{in ancient}} Egypt. It {{was made of}} cloth and was worn around the waist, {{typically}} extending to <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees.</b> Shendyts are depicted on pharaohs, deities, and commoners {{in a variety of}} situations in Egyptian artwork.|$|R

50|$|The {{height of}} one or maximum two {{cushions}} is limited to 15 cm in playing conditions with no other addition to the wheelchair. In team and class events, no part of <b>the</b> body <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> may {{be attached to the}} chair as this could improve balance.|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{severity}} of his injuries, doctors amputated both of Cleland's legs <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> and his right forearm. He was 25 years old.|$|E
25|$|When falling, skiers in {{this class}} with <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> amputations are taught {{to try to prevent}} the stump of their leg from hitting the snow as it can cause more damage to that leg than the one that is not {{partially}} missing. When working on side stepping, the skier is supported to keep the stump of their leg on the uphill side. Elite skiers are taught to avoid using outriggers as crutches. Skiers are taught to turn using their leg instead of their ski poles. Skiers {{in this class}} can use the outrigger to assist in maintaining their balance as they turn on the hill. A skier with an <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> amputation may have a better ability to complete turns on the opposite of their amputation. In getting on ski lifts, skiers with <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> amputations in this classification should lift their outriggers off the ground and point them forward.|$|E

50|$|Churidaar is a {{variation}} on <b>the</b> salwar, loose <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> and tightly fitted to the calf below. While the salwar is baggy and caught in at the ankle, the churidar fits below <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> with horizontal gathers near the ankles. The churidaar can be worn with any upper garment such as a long kurta, which goes below <b>the</b> <b>knees,</b> {{or as part of}} the anarkali suit.|$|R
50|$|Both men {{and women}} wore little {{clothing}} because of the humid environment. In daily life the Alune adults had a short loincloth {{from the waist down}} made of bark-fibre, similar to the Polynesian tapa cloth. This loincloth reached <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> and it often had decorative patterns. Women wore also necklaces.|$|R
50|$|As of January 1, 2010, men {{are only}} allowed to wear suits from <b>the</b> waist to <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees.</b> They are also only {{permitted}} to wear {{one piece of}} swimwear; they cannot wear briefs underneath jammers. This rule was enacted after the controversy in the Beijing Olympics and Rome World Championships.|$|R
25|$|The ALT flap {{consists}} {{of skin and}} subcutaneous fat of the anterolateral thigh just <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> The vessels nourishing the ALT flap are the perforators of the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery and veins.|$|E
25|$|With {{the rising}} {{popularity}} of the longer coat and waistcoat, the large collected rhinegraves and overskirt were abandoned {{in favor of more}} close fitting breeches. By the late 1670s, close fitted breeches were worn with the stockings worn over them and on or <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> often being gartered with a garter below the knee. With the long waistcoat and stockings worn over the knee, very little of the breeches could be seen. A possible reason that the stockings were worn over the knee, was to give the impression of longer legs since the waist coat fell very low, just <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> The breeches tended to be of the same material as the coat. The stockings varied in color.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, a hip spica {{may only}} extend down {{one or more}} legs to <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> Such casts, called pantaloon casts, are {{occasionally}} seen to immobilize an injured lumbar spine or pelvis, {{in which case the}} trunk portion of the cast usually extends to the armpits.|$|E
25|$|Also called zebra bars, tiger stripes, or garters, leg {{bars are}} the most common {{accessory}} to the dorsal stripe. Leg bars are most commonly seen on or <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> and hocks, and reflect the underlying coat color. Leg bars on bay duns are black within the points, and reddish above them.|$|R
50|$|They are {{sometimes}} confused with or {{referred to as}} topcoats, which are shorter and end at or <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees.</b> Topcoats and overcoats together are known as outercoats. Unlike overcoats, topcoats are usually made from lighter weight cloth such as gabardine or covert, while overcoats are made from heavier cloth or fur.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You've chewed {{the string}} so I can't find the knot,' I said as I worked with {{trembling}} fingers at the cater-pillar's throat. Something untied itself, and Mr. Wontner wriggled out, collarless, tieless, his coat split half down his back, his waistcoat unbuttoned, his watch-chain snapped, his trousers rucked well <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|R
25|$|This {{species is}} {{irritable}} and fast-moving. It is also regarded {{as being more}} excitable and unpredictable than B. atrox. Its large size and habit of raising its head high off the ground can result in bites <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> It has also been observed to eject venom over a distance of at least 6ft (1.8m) in fine jets from the tips of its fangs (Mole, 1924).|$|E
25|$|Skiers missing an arm use a {{technique}} that corrects lateral balance issues resulting from the missing arm. A skier with an <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> amputation may have a better ability to complete turns on the opposite of their amputation. Skiers with hemiplegia have to be trained to use both sides of their body equally. If they do not, {{they are likely to}} fall over when their skis cross in front of them.|$|E
25|$|In this engagement, the Pulaski Light Artillery {{suffered}} two {{killed and}} one seriously wounded. During the counter-battery duel with a Union battery, First Lieutenant Omer Weaver {{was hit in}} the chest by solid shot while commanding his section of the battery, and soon died. Private Hugh Byler was hit <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> with solid shot, which shot away his leg. Later, during the infantry support phase, Private Richard Byrd was shot in the leg by a Minié ball.|$|E
500|$|One {{spotting}} pattern, sabino, {{does exist}} in purebred Arabians. Sabino coloring {{is characterized by}} white markings such as [...] "high white" [...] <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> and hocks, irregular spotting on the legs, belly and face, white markings that extend beyond the eyes or under the chin and jaw, and sometimes lacy or roaned edges.|$|R
50|$|Thigh-high boots, known also as thigh-length boots {{or simply}} thigh boots, are boots that extend <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees.</b> Other terms for this {{footwear}} include over-the-knee boots (abbreviated OTK boots; the full term {{is also used}} for the 15th century riding boots for men, later adopted by women) and, especially when cuffed, pirate boots. Lengths vary from reaching just over <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> to reaching almost to the crotch (referred to as crotch boots or crotch-high boots).|$|R
5000|$|A miniskirt (sometimes {{hyphenated}} as mini-skirt or separated as mini skirt) is a {{skirt with}} a hemline well <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees,</b> generally at mid-thigh level, normally {{no longer than}} 10 cm below the buttocks; and a dress with such a hemline is called a minidress or a miniskirt dress. A micro-miniskirt or microskirt is a miniskirt with its hemline at the upper thigh.|$|R
