5|$|In the game's introduction, {{the ghost}} of Garamon haunts the Avatar's dreams with {{warnings}} of a great danger in Britannia. The Avatar allows Garamon to take him there, where he watches Tyball kidnap Arial. Tyball escapes, leaving the Avatar to be caught by the Baron's guards. The guards {{take him to the}} Baron, who banishes him to the Great Stygian Abyss to rescue Arial. After the introduction, the Avatar explores the dungeon and finds remnants of Cabirus's colony. A few possible scenarios include deciding the fate of two warring goblin tribes, learning a language, and playing <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>to</b> complete a quest. The Avatar eventually defeats Tyball and frees Arial.|$|E

25|$|According to Gardner and Lambert (1972) {{a learner}} is {{instrumental}} orientated if learning {{a foreign language}} has a function, e.g. for success in career terms.

25|$|The School of Oriental Studies {{was founded}} by the British state as <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>to</b> {{strengthen}} Britain's political, commercial and military presence in Asia and Africa. It would do so by providing instruction to colonial administrators (Colonial Service and Indian Civil Service), commercial managers and military officers, but also to missionaries, doctors and teachers, {{in the language of}} that part of Asia or Africa to which each was being posted, together with an authoritative introduction to the customs, religion, laws and history of the people whom they were to govern or among whom they would be working.|$|E
25|$|Bradmore {{instructed}} honey to be {{poured into}} the wound and invented <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>to</b> {{be used in the}} extraction. Two threaded tongs held a centre threaded tong, which could be inserted into the wound: the shape not unlike a corkscrew inside a split cylinder. The centre rod, once it located the shaft of the arrowhead, could be inserted into the socket and it, along with the device could be extracted. The instrument was quickly made, either by Bradmore or by a blacksmith to Bradmore's specifications. Bradmore himself guided it into the wound to extract the arrowhead successfully. The wound was then filled with alcohol (wine) to cleanse it.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-twentieth century, when Gode led the {{development}} of Interlingua, the ideals underlying Esperanto had come to seem naive. Influenced by Herder, Gode propounded a Romantic, anti-positivist view of language: languages are {{an aspect of the}} culture of a people, not <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>to</b> achieve a goal; an ideology cannot be attached to a language, except artificially. This implied, in his view, that a world language on the Esperanto model was either impossible or, worse, achievable only through totalitarian coercion. He was of the opinion that, unless imposed by force, a universal global language would presuppose a universal global culture, which does not currently exist and is not necessarily desirable.|$|E

25|$|Giffen {{goods are}} {{difficult}} to study because the definition requires a number of observable conditions. One reason for the difficulty in studying market demand for Giffen goods that is Giffen originally envisioned a specific situation faced by individuals in poverty. Modern consumer behaviour research methods often deal in aggregates that average out income levels, and are too blunt <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>to</b> capture these specific situations. Complicating the matter are the requirements for limited availability of substitutes, {{as well as that}} the consumers are not so poor that they can only afford the inferior good. For this reason, many text books use the term Giffen paradox rather than Giffen good.|$|E
25|$|Beckman married Mabel on June 10, 1925. In 1926 {{the couple}} {{moved back to}} California and Beckman resumed his studies at Caltech. He became {{interested}} in ultraviolet photolysis and worked with his doctoral advisor, Roscoe G. Dickinson, on <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>to</b> find the energy of ultraviolet light. It worked by shining the ultraviolet light onto a thermocouple, converting the incident heat into electricity, which drove a galvanometer. After receiving a Ph.D. in photochemistry in 1928 for this application of quantum theory to chemical reactions, Beckman was asked to stay on at Caltech as an instructor {{and then as a}} professor. Linus Pauling, another of Roscoe G. Dickinson's graduate students, was also asked to stay on at Caltech.|$|E
25|$|In 1862, concert guitarist Julián Arcas, on tour in Castellón, {{heard the}} young Tárrega play and advised Tárrega's father to allow Francisco {{to come to}} Barcelona to study with him. Tárrega's father agreed, but insisted that his son take piano lessons as well. The guitar was viewed as <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>to</b> {{accompany}} singers, while the piano was quite popular throughout Europe. However, Tárrega had to stop his lessons shortly after, when Arcas left for a concert tour abroad. Although Tárrega was only ten years old, he ran away and tried to start a musical career on his own by playing in coffee houses and restaurants in Barcelona. He was soon found and brought back to his father, who had to make great sacrifices to advance his son's musical education.|$|E

25|$|In {{order for}} <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>to</b> {{accompany}} the qin, its sound must be mellow and not overwhelm the qin. Thus, the xiao generally {{used for this}} purpose is one pitched in the key of F, known as qin xiao 「琴簫」, which is narrower than an ordinary xiao. If one sings to qin songs (which is rare nowadays) then one should not sing in an operatic or folk style as is common in China, but rather in a very low pitched and deep way; and the range in which one should sing should not exceed one and a half octaves. The style of singing is similar to that used to recite Tang poetry. To enjoy qin songs, one must learn to become accustomed to the eccentric style some players may sing their songs to, like in the case of Zha Fuxi.|$|E
25|$|Successful snail culture {{requires}} the correct equipment and supplies, including: snail pens or enclosures; devices for measuring humidity (hygrometer), temperature (thermometer), soil moisture (soil moisture sensor), and light (in foot candles); a weight scale and <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>to</b> measure snail size; a kit for testing soil contents; and {{a magnifying glass}} to see the eggs. Equipment to control the climate (temperature and humidity), to regulate water (e.g., a sprinkler system to keep the snails moist and a drainage system), to provide light and shade, and to kill or keep out pests and predators may also be needed. Some horticultural systems such as artificial lighting systems and water sprinklers may be adapted for snail culture. Better results are obtained if snails {{of the same kind}} and generation are used. Some recommend putting the hatchlings in another pen.|$|E
25|$|Bach wrote virtuoso {{music for}} {{specific}} instruments, {{as well as}} music independent of instrumentation. For instance, the Sonatas and partitas for solo violin are considered the pinnacle {{of what has been}} written for this instrument, only within reach of accomplished players: the music fits the instrument, pushing it to the full scale of its possibilities, requiring virtuosity of the player, but without bravura. Notwithstanding that the music and the instrument seem inseparable, Bach made transcriptions for other instruments of some pieces of this collection. Similarly, for the cello suites, the virtuoso music seems tailored for the instrument, the best of what is on offer for it, yet Bach made an arrangement for lute of one of these suites. Likewise for much of his most virtuoso keyboard music. Bach exploited the capabilities of <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>to</b> the fullest while keeping the core of such music independent of the instrument on which it is performed.|$|E
