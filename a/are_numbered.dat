The original order of 300 rail cars (90 {{of which are in}} operation as of April 18, 2017) was manufactured by Rohr Industries, with final delivery in 1978. These cars <b>are</b> <b>numbered</b> 1000–1299 and were rehabilitated in the mid-1990s. Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie (Breda), now AnsaldoBreda, manufactured the second order of 76 cars delivered in 1983 and 1984. These cars, numbered 2000–2075, were rehabilitated in the early 2000s by Alstom in Hornell, New York. A third order of 288 cars, also from Breda, were delivered between 1984 and 1988.

In 2013 the NSW and ACT conversion to alphanumeric routes occurred {{and the remainder}} of the highway (south of Hindmarsh Drive in the ACT) was then also signed as B23. This violates the convention in New South Wales, where numbered routes below 50 are prefixed with an 'A' and 'B' routes <b>are</b> <b>numbered</b> above 50; the violation was allowed so the number and letter would be consistent across state lines.|$|E

5|$|The Interstate Highways and U.S. Routes in Delaware <b>are</b> <b>numbered</b> {{according}} to a national numbering pattern. Interstate Highways that run north–south have odd numbers, increasing from west to east, while those that run east–west have even numbers, increasing from south to north.

Three-digit Interstates begin with odd numbers if they are a spur and an even number if they are a bypass or beltway and repeat numbers in different states. As such, the major north–south Interstate along the East Coast, Interstate 95 (I-95), passes through northern New Castle County. I-495 bypasses the section of I-95 {{that runs through the}} city of Wilmington.|$|E

The first bridge over Plunketts Creek was replaced with a covered bridge in 1880, and the second bridge was replaced in 1886.
