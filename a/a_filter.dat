5|$|Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) exposed boiled broths to the air, in {{vessels that}} {{contained}} <b>a</b> <b>filter</b> to prevent particles from passing {{through to the}} growth medium, and also in vessels without <b>a</b> <b>filter,</b> but with air allowed in via a curved tube so dust particles would settle and not {{come in contact with}} the broth. By boiling the broth beforehand, Pasteur ensured that no microorganisms survived within the broths {{at the beginning of his}} experiment. Nothing grew in the broths in the course of Pasteur's experiment. This meant that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than spontaneously generated within the broth. Thus, Pasteur dealt the death blow to the theory of spontaneous generation and supported the germ theory of disease.|$|E

5|$|Extending this work, Nirenberg and Philip Leder {{revealed}} the code's triplet nature and deciphered its codons. In these experiments, various combinations of mRNA were passed through <b>a</b> <b>filter</b> that contained ribosomes, {{the components of}} cells that translate RNA into protein. Unique triplets promoted the binding of specific tRNAs to the ribosome. Leder and Nirenberg were able to determine the sequences of 54 out of 64 codons in their experiments.

5|$|The plots shown {{of image}} impedance, {{attenuation}} and phase change are the plots of a low-pass prototype filter section. The prototype has a cut-off frequency of ωc = 1 rad/s and a nominal impedance R0 = 1 Ω. This {{is produced by}} <b>a</b> <b>filter</b> half-section where L = 1 henry and C = 1 farad. This prototype can be impedance scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values. The low-pass prototype can also be transformed into high-pass, band-pass or band-stop types by application of suitable frequency transformations.|$|E
5|$|Today, it {{is often}} {{preferred}} to carry out filtering in the digital domain where complex algorithms are much easier to implement, but analogue filters do still find applications, especially for low-order simple filtering tasks and are often still the norm at higher frequencies where digital technology is still impractical, or at least, less cost effective. Wherever possible, and especially at low frequencies, analogue filters are now implemented in <b>a</b> <b>filter</b> topology which is active {{in order to avoid}} the wound components (i.e. inductors, transformers, etc.) required by passive topology.|$|E
5|$|Viewing the Sun through light-concentrating optics such as {{binoculars}} {{may result}} in permanent damage to the retina without an appropriate filter that blocks UV and substantially dims the sunlight.

5000|$|Similarly, <b>a</b> <b>filtered</b> {{probability}} space (also {{known as}} a stochastic basis) , is a probability space equipped with the filtration [...] of its σ-algebra [...] <b>A</b> <b>filtered</b> probability space is said to satisfy the usual conditions if it is complete (i.e., [...] contains all -null sets) and right-continuous (i.e. [...] for all times [...] ).|$|R
2500|$|<b>A</b> high-pass <b>filter</b> (HPF) is <b>an</b> {{electronic}} <b>filter</b> {{that passes}} signals with a frequency {{higher than a}} certain cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency. The amount of attenuation for each frequency depends on the <b>filter</b> design. [...] <b>A</b> high-pass <b>filter</b> is usually modeled as a linear time-invariant system. It is sometimes called <b>a</b> low-cut <b>filter</b> or bass-cut filter. High-pass filters have many uses, such as blocking DC from circuitry sensitive to non-zero average voltages or radio frequency devices.

5|$|Voyager 1s Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS), now disabled, {{consisted}} of two cameras: a 200mm focal length, low-resolution wide-angle camera (WA), used for spatially extended imaging, and a 1500mm high-resolution narrow-angle camera (NA) – the one that took Pale Blue Dot – intended for detailed imaging of specific targets. Both cameras were of the slow-scan vidicon tube type and were fitted with eight colored filters, mounted on <b>a</b> <b>filter</b> wheel {{placed in front of}} the tube.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, stubs {{lend themselves}} to band-pass designs. General forms of these are similar to stub low-pass filters except that the main line {{is no longer a}} narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by λ/4 impedance transformers. The stubs {{in the body of the}} filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages. The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. <b>A</b> <b>filter</b> with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ/4 impedance transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as <b>a</b> <b>filter</b> bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.|$|E

It is <b>a</b> <b>filter</b> feeder, sieving microscopic algae from water that passes through its gills. It is preyed on by starfish, octopuses and sea otters. It can detect predators by smell and by sight and can swim away from them by opening and closing its valves. Other organisms often grow on the exterior of its shell and it often forms a symbiotic relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on the upper valve and helps protect it from predators.|$|E
5|$|Transversal {{filters are}} not usually {{associated}} with passive implementations but the concept {{can be found in}} a Wiener and Lee patent from 1935 which describes <b>a</b> <b>filter</b> consisting of a cascade of all-pass sections. The outputs of the various sections are summed in the proportions needed to result in the required frequency function. This works by the principle that certain frequencies will be in, or close to antiphase, at different sections and will tend to cancel when added. These are the frequencies rejected by the filter and can produce filters with very sharp cut-offs. This approach did not find any immediate applications, and is not common in passive filters. However, the principle finds many applications as an active delay line implementation for wide band discrete-time filter applications such as television, radar and high-speed data transmission.|$|E
