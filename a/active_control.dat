5|$|During {{test flights}} of the Su-27Ms, {{which began in}} 1988, {{engineers}} discovered that pilots failed to maintain <b>active</b> <b>control</b> of the aircraft at high angles of attack due to the ineffectiveness of flight control surfaces at low speeds. The decision was therefore made to install thrust-vectoring engines to the eleventh Su-27 (factory code T10M-11), which had been built by the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association in the country's Far East and was {{being used as a}} radar test bed. Following the airframe's completion in early 1995, the aircraft was delivered to the design bureau's experimental plant near Moscow, where engineers started installing the nozzles to the aircraft. Although Sukhoi had intended the Lyulka-Saturn AL-37FU to power the aircraft, the engine had not yet been flight cleared. Therefore the aircraft was temporarily fitted with the less-powerful AL-31FP engine, which was essentially an AL-31F engine that had the AL-100 vectoring nozzles of the AL-37FU. The aircraft was rolled out in May. Two months later, the temporary engines were replaced with AL-37FUs; its nozzles could only deflect 15 degrees up or down in the pitch axis, and can deflect together or differentially.|$|E

An elemental model based on structural mobility functions and acoustic impedance functions has been developed to investigate the principal effects and limitations of feed-forward <b>active</b> noise <b>control</b> and decentralised velocity feedback vibration control.

The challenges thrown by <b>active</b> noise <b>control</b> have attracted the notice of the scientific community to engage them in intense level of research. Cancellation of acoustic noise electronically in a simple and efficient way is the vital merit of the <b>active</b> noise <b>control</b> system. A detailed study about existing strategies for <b>active</b> noise <b>control</b> has been undertaken in the present work. This study has given an insight regarding various factors influencing performance of modern <b>active</b> noise <b>control</b> systems. The development of new training algorithms and structures for <b>active</b> noise <b>control</b> are <b>active</b> fields of research which are exploiting the benefits of different signal processing and soft- computing techniques. The nonlinearity contributed by environment and various components of <b>active</b> noise <b>control</b> system greatly affects the ultimate performance of an active noise canceller. This fact motivated to pursue the research work in developing novel architectures and algorithms to address the issues of nonlinear <b>active</b> noise <b>control.</b> One of the primary focus of the work is the application of artificial neural network to effectively combat the problem of <b>active</b> noise <b>control.</b> This is because artificial neural networks are inherently nonlinear processors and possesses capabilities of universal approximation and thus are well suited to exhibit high performance when used in nonlinear <b>active</b> noise <b>control.</b> The present work contributed significantly in designing efficient nonlinear active noise canceller based on neural network platform.

25|$|In {{a review}} article by Pierce & Buxbaum (2002), they {{concluded}} that the evidence for Hemispheric Activation Approaches, which focuses on moving the limb {{on the side of}} the neglect, has conflicting evidence in the literature. The authors note that a possible limitation in this approach is the requirement for the patients to actively move the neglected limb, which may not be possible for many patients. Constraint-Induced Therapy (CIT), appears to be an effective, long-term treatment for improving neglect in various studies. However, the use of CIT is limited to patients who have <b>active</b> <b>control</b> of wrist and hand extension. Prism Glasses, Hemispatial Glasses, and Eye-Patching have all appear to be effective in improving performance on neglect tests. Caloric Stimulation treatment appears to be effective in improving neglect; however, the effects are generally short-term. The review also suggests that Optokinetic Stimulation is effective in improving position sense, motor skills, body orientation, and perceptual neglect on a short-term basis. As with Caloric Stimulation treatment, long-term studies will be necessary to show its effectiveness. A few Trunk Rotation Therapy studies suggest its effectiveness in improving performance on neglect tests as well as the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Some less studied treatment possibilities include treatments that target Dorsal Stream of visual processing, Mental Imagery Training, and Neck Vibration Therapy. Trunk rotation therapies aimed at improving postural disorders and balance deficits in patients with unilateral neglect, have demonstrated optimistic results in regaining voluntary trunk control when using specific postural rehabilitative devices. One such device is the Bon Saint Côme apparatus, which uses spatial exploratory tasks in combination with auditory and visual feedback mechanisms to develop trunk control. The Bon Saint Côme device has been shown to be effective with hemiplegic subjects due to the combination of trunk stability exercises, along with the cognitive requirements needed to perform the postural tasks.|$|E
