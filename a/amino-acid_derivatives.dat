Information on innate immune responses to S. maltophilia {{and its potential}} modulation are scarce. MethodsWe established an in vitro S. maltophilia whole blood sepsis model and studied the proinflammatory cytokine production of CD 14 -positive cells by flow cytometry. We compared the cytokine expression of term newborns (n= 13) and healthy adults (n= 10) and investigated in vitro responses of pediatric oncology patients after recovery from neutropenia (n= 10) with healthy adults (n= 10). We further evaluated the immunomodulatory role of the <b>amino-acid</b> <b>derivative</b> taurolidine in our in vitro sepsis model. ResultsProinflammatory cytokine responses to S. maltophilia were largely diminished in the neonatal population. No remarkable differences were noted for cytokine responses between pediatric oncology patients and healthy controls.

40|$|Background: G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are {{the largest}} and most diverse family of transmembrane receptors. They respond {{to a wide range of}} stimuli, {{including}} small peptides, lipid analogs, <b>amino-acid</b> <b>derivatives,</b> and sensory stimuli such as light, taste and odor, and transmit signals to the interior of the cell through interaction with heterotrimeric G proteins. A large number of putative GPCRs have no identified natural ligand. We hypothesized that a more complete knowledge of the phylogenetic relationship of these orphan receptors to receptors with known ligands could facilitate ligand identification, as related receptors often have ligands with similar structural features.

40|$|A {{model system}} is {{described}} for the enzymatic deprotection of suitably masked amino groups during stepwise peptide synthesis. Nitrophenyl esters of amino acids, N-protected with trypsin-labile benzyloxycarbonylarginyl groups, were prepared as crystalline, analytically pure picrate salts in a standardized procedure. These intermediates {{were shown to}} react with amino compounds to form the expected peptide linkages. A pair of diasteriomeric peptides prepared in this way and featuring benzyloxycarbonylarginyl-L-, AND -D-glutaminyl sequences, respectively, were subjected to tryptic digestion. In both cases, a specific cleavage of the arginyl bond was achieved; however, the peptide containing the L-glutaminyl residue was deprotected much more rapidly than its diasteriomer containing the D-glutaminyl residue. The hydrolysis of the former isomer was not noticeably impeded {{by the presence of}} the latter. The results of these studies suggest that C-activated <b>amino-acid</b> <b>derivatives,</b> N-protected with trypsin-labile groups, are readily prepared in convenient form and that the peptide derivatives prepared from these intermediates are readily freed of their amino-protecting groups under mild, aqueous conditions with a potentially useful degree of stereospecificity.

It inhibits, in vitro, the adherence of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus to human epithelial and fibroblast cells. Taurolidine is unstable {{in aqueous solution}} and breaks down into derivatives which {{are thought to be}} responsible for the biological activity. To understand the taurolidine antibacterial mechanism of action, we provide the experimental single crystal X-ray diffraction results together with theoretical methods to characterize the hydrolysis/decomposition reactions of taurolidine. The crystal structure features two independent molecules linked through intermolecular H-bonds with one of them somewhat positively charged. Taurolidine in a biological environment exists in equilibrium with taurultam derivatives and this is described theoretically as a 2 -step process without an energy barrier: formation of cationic taurolidine followed by a nucleophilic attack of O(hydroxyl) on the exocyclic C(methylene). A concerted mechanism describes the further hydrolysis of the taurolidine derivative methylol-taurultam. The interaction of methylol-taurultam with the diaminopimelic NH 2 group in the E. coli bacteria cell wall (peptidoglycan) has a negative DG value (238. 2 kcal/mol) but a high energy barrier (45. 8 kcal/ mol) suggesting no reactivity.

Despite significant research pointing to a function in oxidative stress defence, the exact mechanisms of action of ergothioneine remain elusive. Although both humans and bacterial pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis seem to depend on ergothioneine, humans are devoid of the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes. Therefore, its biosynthesis may emerge as potential drug target {{in the development of}} novel therapeutics against tuberculosis. The recent identification of ergothioneine-biosynthetic genes in M. smegmatis enables a more systematic study of its biology.

40|$|Abstract The {{significance}} of amides {{as a component}} of biomolecules and synthetic products has triggered the development of catalytic direct amidation methods which involve reaction of a carboxylic acid and amine to form an amide with water as the only by-product. These methods evade the need for stoichiometric activation or coupling reagents and hence, are important green chemical processes. Investigations into direct amide formation began with the development a mild reaction conditions for the direct amidation reaction with known arylboronic acid catalysts in two different model reactions and compared with both reported and potential organometallic catalysts (Zr and Fe based). After a systematic evaluation of solvent, temperature and catalyst, ambient reaction conditions were applied in the direct amidation of <b>amino-acid</b> <b>derivatives</b> in order to exploit these more economical reagents for peptide synthesis which is both little used and little explored. Protected amino acid derivatives showed slow reactivity compared to simple amine-carboxylic acid combinations and hence high catalyst loadings were required, though did proceed at 65 68 °C generally avoiding racemisation. However, an interesting synergistic catalytic effect was observed during dipeptide formation using mixture of two arylboronic acid catalysts (1 : 1) in the direct amidation reaction at lower temperatures, although the process was particularly slow. This impressive result led to explore more about the effect of ‘Cooperative Catalysts’, particularly, on the less reactive acid-amine combination. As a consequence, some commercially important synthesis has been reviewed through this novel cooperative catalysis to ensure their real applicability in industries. Acceptance of the practicability and general applicability of this new approach depends upon the understanding of the mechanism of the cooperative catalysis. In order to reveal the mechanism of the cooperative catalysis the direct amide formation reactions were followed by the real time monitoring technology (React-IR) and HPLC. However, further investigations are required to understand the mechanistic intricacies of this cooperative catalysis. Further, the role of H-bonding in the amide bond formation with significantly inert acid (pivalic acid) towards the amine to form amide has been attempted. In order to accelerate the catalytic activity the use of a potential catalyst promoter, ‘ANB 209 ’ in the direct amidation reactions was also examined. Improvements in catalysts activity or alterations in catalyst would need further study so that the direct amide formation becomes a common tool {{for a wide range of}} carboxylic acid and amine partners. The effect of different substituents on the α-position of carboxylic acid with various amine substrates was investigated to understand the exceptional direct amide formation of the synthesis of mandipropamid, a well known fungicide. Both uncatalysed and catalysed direct amidations of mandelic acid was done with different amine substrates at different temperatures, resulting different rate of amide formation. Finally, the application of two novel borinic acid (R 1 RBOH) compounds in the direct amide formation reactions has been assessed for the first time, which displayed in some cases the potential to act as catalysts for direct amide formation. Further research will likely to accelerate the developments of this type of catalysts in direct amidations. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} extent of {{interdependency}} between the sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) assimilation pathways in the commercially important, S-accumulating, monocot species, onion CUDH 2107 (Allium cepa L.), to elucidate some of the regulatory points of cross-talk between these two pathways. To test the interactions between the two pathways, a factorial S x N depletion experiment was set up. Plants were grown in short day conditions to maintain the pre-bulbing stage after which they were transferred to long day conditions to promote bulbing. At {{the end of the}} short day conditions, the plants were harvested as leaf, pseudo stem and root {{and at the end of}} the long day conditions, as leaf, bulb and roots, for each of the four treatments. The four treatments comprised of control treatment (designated C; comprising 14 mM N and 2 mM S), low S treatment (designated –S; comprising 14 mM N and 0. 25 mM S), low N treatment (designated –N; comprising 3. 5 mM N, 2 mM S) and coupled low S and N treatment (designated –S-N; comprising 0. 25 mM S and 3. 5 mM N). In terms of changes in biomass, both the root and the shoot biomass tended to be higher under the –S treatment at the bulbing stage, although these changes were only significant for the root biomass. Under the – N and the –S-N treatments, the shoot biomass was much lower when compared with the control plants at both the pre-bulbing and the bulbing stage, although no change in the root biomass was observed. The exception was at the bulbing stage under the –S-N treatment where the root biomass was significantly higher when compared with the control plants. At the transcriptional level in response to the -S treatment, the relative transcript abundance of commonly used S-starvation marker genes, AcHAST 1; 1 LIKE 1 and AcAPSR 1 increased in both root and the leaf tissue and was more marked at bulbing. In contrast, transcript abundance of AcAPSK 1, which marks a bifurcation in the S-assimilation pathway, decreased. At bulbing, a decrease in the relative transcript abundance of AcATPS 1, AcSIR 1 and AcOASTL 3 in the leaf tissue and AcATPS 1, AcAPSK 1, AcOASTL 2, AcNRT 2; 1 LIKE 1 and AcNiR 1 in the root tissue was observed in response to the –S treatment. However, in response to N deprivation, under the –N as well as –S-N treatment, the transcript abundance of AcHAST 1; 1 LIKE 1 and AcAPSR 1 was dramatically reduced in the roots with a significant induction in the leaf tissue at both the stages. In addition, relative transcript abundance of AcATPS 1, AcAPSK 1 and AcSOX 1 also increased whereas AcOASTL 2, AcNR 1 and AcNiR 1 decreased under the –N and the –S-N treatments in the leaf tissue, at pre-bulbing. However, at bulbing, transcript levels of AcOASTL 2 and AcNR 1 also increased under both, the –N and the –S-N treatments. In the roots, at pre-bulbing, the relative transcript abundance of AcHAST 1; 1 LIKE 1, AcNRT 2; 1 LIKE 1 and all the down-stream reductive S and N assimilation genes investigated declined, while the transcript abundance of AcAPSK 1 increased. A similar response was observed at the bulbing stage for most genes except AcSOX 1 and AcOASTL 3 which increased and AcOASTL 1, AcOASTL 2 and AcNRT 2; 1 LIKE 1 showed no change. Similar to the leaf under the –S-N treatment, the transcriptional profile of the genes investigated in the roots under the –S-N treatment also showed a dominant response to N depletion. In terms of protein accumulation and enzyme activity, AcSiR 1 declined in the –S treatment but accumulated in the –N and the –S-N treatment in the leaf tissue at pre-bulbing whereas at bulbing, a decline in protein accumulation was observed under all three treatments. The AcSiR 1 enzyme activity declined under the –S and the –N treatment but remained unchanged under the –S-N treatment in the leaf tissue at the pre-bulbing as well as the bulbing stage. In the roots, AcSiR 1 accumulated under the –S treatment in both the stages whereas activity remained unchanged. No AcSiR 1 protein could be detected under the –N treatment at both stages and in the –S-N treatment at pre-bulbing, whereas the activity increased under these treatments at both stages. Under the –S treatment in the leaf tissue, AcNiR 1 accumulated slightly at both pre-bulbing and bulbing whereas the activity remained unchanged. Under the –N and the –S-N treatments, AcNiR 1 declined in the leaves at pre-bulbing but accumulated at the bulbing stage. However, the activity remained unchanged at the pre-bulbing stage and was below the assay detection limit at bulbing. In the roots, the AcNiR 1 accumulation response was similar to that in the leaf tissue under each treatment at both the stages, whereas the activity declined under all treatments at both stages except at the pre-bulbing stage under the –S treatment where it remained unchanged. The accumulation of a set of targeted metabolites was also compared over the four treatments. A decline in the S containing flavour precursors, including the lachrymatory factor, thiopropanal-S-oxide, was observed in all tissues in response to low S supply. However, glutathione only declined in the leaf at the bulbing stage. An effect of the –S treatment on the accumulation of N-containing metabolites was observed as an accumulation of the amino-acids in the pseudo-stem and the bulb. In contrast, a decline in the accumulation of the <b>amino-acids</b> and <b>derivatives</b> was observed in the leaf at bulbing. In response to the –N treatment, most of the N-containing metabolites declined systemically, including the N-pathway cysteine precursor, O-acetylserine and serine. Flavonol glucosides accumulated in a tissue-specific manner in the pseudostem at the pre-bulbing stage but declined in the bulb tissue. Generally, sugars accumulated systemically at both developmental stages whereas sugar phosphates accumulated only in the leaf and root tissue at the pre-bulbing stage. The lachrymatory factor thiopropanal-S-oxide, accumulated in the leaf at the pre-bulbing stage but declined at the bulbing stage in response to the –N treatment. The metabolite accumulation profile in the plants under the –S-N treatment was similar in all tissues to that of the –N treatment at both the stages. The results from the factorial experiment suggest a hierarchy of N nutrition over S nutrition in A. cepa, where the incorporation and accumulation of S metabolites as well as bulb formation is regulated by N availability. A putatively novel point of interaction between the S-assimilation and the N-assimilation pathways via sulfite reductase (AcSiR 1) and nitrite reductase (AcNiR 1) was also investigated. Recombinant AcSiR 1 and AcNiR 1 were each able to reduce both sulfite and nitrite, although with a higher specific activity for the physiological substrate in each case. Further, solid phase binding assay indicated a positive interaction between the two recombinant proteins, although this could not be confirmed by Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). In addition to this, in a short term S x N depletion experiment with Arabidopsis, AtSiR 1 transcripts only declined in the –S-N treatment in the leaves whereas AtNiR 1 transcripts declined in the –S, -N as well as –S-N treatment in wild type plants. In the roots, AtSiR 1 transcripts decline in both the –N and the –S-N treatment in the roots whereas no significant change was observed in the AtNiR 1 transcripts. In a sir 1 T-DNA knock-down line of Arabidopsis, the AtSiR 1 and the AtNiR 1 transcripts did not change in response to any treatment in both leaf and the roots. Substrate redundancy between AcSiR 1 and AcNiR 1, in vitro, along with the other interaction studies suggest that although both AcSiR 1 and AcNiR 1 can reduce both substrates, the possibility of this being a direct point of cross-talk between the two pathways is not conclusively established...|$|R
