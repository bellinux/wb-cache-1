40|$|A {{branching}} process of particles moving at finite velocity over the geodesic {{lines of the}} hyperbolic space (Poincare ́ half-plane and Poincare ́ disk) is examined. Each particle can split into two particles only once at Poisson paced times and deviates orthogonally when splitted. At time t, after N(t) Poisson events, there <b>are</b> <b>N(t)</b> + 1 particles moving along different geodesic lines. We are able to obtain the exact expression of the mean hyperbolic distance {{of the center of}} mass of the cloud of particles. We derive such mean hyperbolic distance from two different and independent ways and we study the behavior of the relevant expression as t increases and for different values of the parameters c (hyperbolic velocity of motion) and λ (rate of reproduction). The mean hyperbolic distance of each moving particle is also examined and a useful representation, as the distance of a randomly stopped particle moving over the main geodesic line, is presented...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{will discuss}} life tables and Kaplan-Meier estimators, which {{are similar to}} life tables. Then I turn to proportional-hazards models, aka “Cox models. ” Along the way, I {{will look at the}} {{efficacy}} of screening for lung cancer, the impact of negative religious feelings on survival, and the efficacy of hormone replacement therapy. What are the conclusions about statistical practice? Proportional-hazards models are frequently used to analyze data from randomized controlled trials. This is a mistake. Randomization does not justify the models, which are rarely informative. Simpler analytic methods should be used first. With observational studies, the models would help us disentangle causal relations if the assumptions behind the models could be justified. Justifying those assumptions, however, is fraught with difficulty. Cross-sectional life tables Cross-sectional life tables date back to John Graunt and Edmond Halley in the 17 th century. There were further developments by Daniel Bernoulli in 1760, when he computed what life expectancy would be—if smallpox were eliminated. His calculations make a key assumption, to be discussed later: the independence of competing risks. Here is a simple discrete case to illustrate the idea behind cross-sectional life tables (“cross-sectional ” because they can be computed from vital statistics available at one point in time, covering people of all ages). There <b>are</b> <b>Nt</b> people alive at the beginning of age t,butntof them die before reaching age t+ 1. The death probability in year t of life is nt/Nt, the survival probability is 1 − nt/Nt.
