5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling <b>asleep,</b> so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling <b>asleep.</b> Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall <b>asleep</b> may induce frustration that further prevents falling <b>asleep,</b> so in such situations a person may be advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, of 393 men {{sentenced to}} death for falling <b>asleep</b> on sentry duty in all theatres in World War I, only two were {{executed}} (sentries were usually posted in pairs to keep one another awake; these two, who served in Mesopotamia, were made an example of because they were found sitting <b>asleep</b> together, suggesting that they had colluded).|$|E

5|$|Oral {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for the short-term treatment of moderately severe insomnia {{in people who}} have not reacted adequately to other hypnotics, and who have persistent trouble in falling <b>asleep.</b> Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used for people who have trouble staying <b>asleep</b> through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, and lormetazepam, are used for those purposes. Midazolam and other benzodiazepines may cause a deterioration in sleep quality.|$|E
5|$|Please don't turn {{me into a}} hero. I am not a hero, I am {{someone that}} was <b>asleep</b> for 12 days.|$|E
5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures {{have been shown to}} disrupt continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and pillows, and eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall <b>asleep.</b>|$|E
5|$|Back in Oslo, {{his colleagues}} throw him a {{farewell}} party, but Odda timid manis {{uncomfortable with the}} attention. As the party moves to a co-worker's apartment, he ends up getting accidentally locked out. He climbs up a scaffold, {{trying to reach the}} apartment window, and ends up in a young boy's room. The boy asks him to stay and wait for him to fall <b>asleep,</b> but Odd falls <b>asleep</b> first.

He is left standing on the platform without any fixed points in his life, with nothing but a life of emptiness stretching out before him.|$|E
5|$|Children with AS {{are more}} likely to have sleep problems, {{including}} difficulty in falling <b>asleep,</b> frequent nocturnal awakenings, and early morning awakenings. AS is also associated with high levels of alexithymia, which is difficulty in identifying and describing one's emotions. Although AS, lower sleep quality, and alexithymia are associated, their causal relationship is unclear.|$|E

At some point before falling <b>asleep,</b> she recalled, she had spoken to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the {{household}} had paged him. She {{told police that}} she and Farrar {{were in the process of}} divorce, though she did not know how far along they were, and that although the children were very upset at the prospect, she herself was not and was looking forward to being able to rebuild her life.|$|E
5|$|I {{have been}} {{thinking}} how very gently I have always been dealt with. I {{have never had a}} violent shove all my life. The only desire which I can have is like David to serve my own generation by the will of God, and then fall <b>asleep.</b>|$|E
5|$|If the {{earthquake}} had {{occurred during the}} early morning while residents were <b>asleep,</b> rather than mid-afternoon (1:52 pm local time), {{it could have been}} deadlier as housing in the epicentral area consisted chiefly of mud and brick.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 and 2001, Flytoget {{experienced}} three derailments {{with empty}} trains at Gardermoen; one {{caused by the}} engineer falling <b>asleep</b> and two by the train passing a red light. No more such accidents occurred after Automatic Train Control was installed in 2001.|$|E

Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she has Krueger, but he falls <b>asleep</b> and is attacked. Krueger goes after Nancy, and {{explains}} that he intentionally left her for last so she would stay awake long enough that, when she finally fell <b>asleep,</b> she would {{no longer be able to}} wake up. Quentin uses the adrenaline to wake up Nancy, who pulls Krueger into reality. She uses a broken blade to cut Krueger's gloved hand off, and then slice his throat. She then torches the secret room, with Krueger's body inside, and she and Quentin leave. Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital; Krueger suddenly appears and kills Nancy's mother before pulling her body through a mirror while Nancy screams.|$|E

5|$|Rowling {{was left}} in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter.

She wrote in many cafés, especially Nicolson's Café (owned by her brother-in-law), and the Elephant House, wherever she could get Jessica to fall <b>asleep.</b> In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in cafés was that taking her baby {{out for a walk}} {{was the best way to}} make her fall <b>asleep.</b>|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} {{is one of}} {{a number}} of species which has unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. One hemisphere of the brain is effectively <b>asleep,</b> while a low-voltage EEG, characteristic of wakefulness, is present in the other. The benefit of this is that the bird can rest in areas of high predation or during long migratory flights, but still retain a degree of alertness.|$|E
5|$|William Shatner as James T. Kirk. Shatner practiced {{aerobics}} {{and strength}} training daily {{to prepare for}} the role. The physical activity and directing duties meant he woke at 4a.m. every day during filming, no matter what time he fell <b>asleep.</b>|$|E

While everyone else is <b>asleep,</b> Mal takes the ship himself and discovers that help never would have arrived.|$|E
5|$|After falling <b>asleep</b> that night, Sam is {{visited in}} a dream by Azazel, who reveals that he has brought them all {{together}} {{so that they can}} fight to the death, with the sole survivor becoming the leader of his army of demons.

Azazel had come into Sam's nursery and fed him his blood, with Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) walking in and recognizing the demon.|$|E
5|$|Against Surrey on August 6, King was overpowering again. It {{was in this}} {{match that}} King gave what Barker called his finest {{first-class}} performance ever. Batting first, he scored 98 runs in the Philadelphian's first innings before being run out, and he then took 3 for 89 in Surrey's reply. In the second innings, he made 113 not out and then took 3 for 98. Surrey lost the match by 110 runs. Apparently, King was so exhausted after his performance that he fell <b>asleep</b> during a speech by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Alverstone at a banquet after the match.|$|E
5|$|All sharks {{need to keep}} {{water flowing}} over their gills {{in order for them}} to breathe, however not all species need to be moving to do this. Those that are able to breathe while not {{swimming}} do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them and as such they are not truly <b>asleep.</b>|$|E
5|$|At 5:30 am on April 19, {{dynamite}} {{was thrown}} through a front window of Z. Alexander Looby's home in north Nashville, apparently {{in retaliation for}} his support of the demonstrators.

More than 140 windows in a nearby dormitory were broken by the blast.|$|E
5|$|At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own {{authority}} over his pirate crew. He {{told the court}} that his crew engaged in piracy against his will, {{and said he had}} warned them that he would leave the crew unless they stopped robbing vessels. He further stated that he had been <b>asleep</b> during the capture of the sloop Francis. The court did not accept these protestations. Boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that Bonnet's quartermaster, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet. A powerful quartermaster {{appears to have been a}} common feature of pirate crews in the early modern era.|$|E
5|$|Back in the present, Lovett {{decides to}} abandon his search after hearing Rose's story.
