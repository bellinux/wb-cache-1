5|$|Aspirin, {{either by}} itself or in a {{combined}} formulation, effectively treats {{certain types of}} <b>a</b> <b>headache,</b> but its efficacy may be questionable for others.

Nickell died shortly thereafter at Harborview Medical Center, where treatment had failed to revive him. His death was initially ruled to be by natural causes, with attending physicians citing emphysema.|$|E

5|$|Streptococcal pharyngitis, {{also known}} as strep throat, is an {{infection}} {{of the back of}} the throat including the tonsils caused by group A streptococcus (GAS). Common symptoms include fever, sore throat, red tonsils, and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. <b>A</b> <b>headache,</b> and nausea or vomiting may also occur. Some develop a sandpaper-like rash which is known as scarlet fever. Symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days.|$|E
5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and <b>a</b> <b>headache,</b> {{followed}} {{in a couple of days}} by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E
50|$|Although NDPH is {{classified}} as <b>a</b> primary <b>headache</b> syndrome, {{it must be remembered}} that a number of important conditions can present with <b>a</b> new-onset persisting <b>headache,</b> and these must be excluded prior to making a diagnosis of <b>a</b> primary <b>headache</b> disorder.|$|R

5|$|CSF can {{be tested}} for the {{diagnosis}} {{of a variety of}} neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested. About one third of people experience <b>a</b> <b>headache</b> after lumbar puncture, and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.|$|E
5|$|In April 1957, his wife's health {{deteriorated}} {{and she was}} hospitalised. Although seriously ill, she recovered {{sufficiently to}} be moved home. On 4 May 1957, while preparing for his wife's homecoming, Kippenberger complained of <b>a</b> <b>headache</b> and then collapsed. Taken to hospital in a coma, he died the next day of a cerebral haemorrhage. He was buried on 7 May at Karori Cemetery in Wellington with full military honours. Ruth Kippenberger watched the funeral procession of her husband from her hospital window; she died ten years later.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people who}} develop SCSFLS feel the sudden onset of a severe and acute headache. It is <b>a</b> <b>headache</b> usually {{made worse by}} standing, {{typically}} becoming prominent throughout the day, with the pain becoming less severe when lying down. Orthostatic headaches can become chronic and disabling {{to the point of}} incapacitation. Some patients with SCSFLS will develop headaches that begin in the afternoon. This is known as second-half-of-the-day headache. This may be an initial presentation of a spontaneous CSF leak or appear after treatment such as an epidural patch, and likely indicates a slow CSF leak.|$|E

5|$|Potter {{had long}} wanted {{to develop a}} book of nursery rhymes, but such a project left Warne cold. Rhymes were already well {{represented}} in the firm's catalogue, and Warne felt Potter's unbridled enthusiasm for the genre would make the project <b>a</b> <b>headache</b> for him. In the past, {{he had tried to}} discourage Potter's interest in rhymes, believing her own stories superior, but she persisted. He reluctantly agreed to a book of rhymes for 1905, but Potter did not have it ready at the end of 1904, so he accepted the tea party tale instead. Early in 1905, it was decided the book would be published {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|Several months later, a {{metallic}} artifact with inscriptions is discovered {{on the beach}} of Côte d'Ivoire in Africa. After Mulder examines rubbings of the object, he begins suffering from <b>a</b> <b>headache,</b> seemingly caused by the rubbings. Mulder's condition worsens, but he gains telepathic abilities. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow) tells them that the symbols on the artifact are Navajo. Eventually, Mulder passes into an aggravated delusional state and is placed under observation at a hospital. Hoping to find an answer, Scully rushes to Africa and finds the massive wreck of a large spacecraft partially buried in the beach.|$|E

5|$|In Boone, North Carolina, Wallace (David Denman) and Angela Schiff (Robyn Lively) {{return home}} after a day out hiking in the fields. Angela gets <b>a</b> <b>headache</b> and, while taking a shower, thinks that she sees images of a yellow {{substance}} running down the walls. Angela and Wallace head off to bed in one another's arms but as the camera pans out the scene shifts to their skeletal remains {{in the same position}} {{in the middle of a}} field. FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate and after closer examination of the bones, the two find a strange yellow substance covering the underside of the skeletons which was missed in the original examination. Mulder, believing that bodies are a result of the famous Brown Mountain Lights, heads out to the scene of the discovery while Scully stays behind with the coroner (Jim Beaver) to perform more tests.|$|E
5|$|The {{naming of}} Q4 {{presented}} <b>a</b> <b>headache</b> for Smallpeice, realising {{that he could}} not seek permission to call the ship the Queen Elizabeth II, as only Royal Navy battleships had been named after a reigning monarch. Smallpeice discussed the issue with the Queen's Private Secretary Sir Michael Adeane and it was agreed that they would recommend to Her Majesty that the ship be named Queen Elizabeth. This was in keeping with normal Cunard practice of reusing previous ships names and didn't present any issues as {{the old and the new}} ships would not be in Cunard service at the same time. Elizabeth II launched the ship on 20 September 1967 but surprised and delighted Smallpeice and the invited guests when she named the ship Queen Elizabeth the Second. Smallpeice believed using the style Queen Elizabeth II wasn't entirely appropriate, it being the designation of the sovereign, and sought permission to use an Arabic 2 in place of Roman numerals.|$|E
5|$|Walter Skinner assigns Fox Mulder and Dana Scully to {{investigate}} Sandoz's disappearance, {{giving them a}} rubbing of Merkmallen's artifact. Mulder tells Skinner that both Merkmallen and Sandoz espoused panspermia, a theory suggesting an extraterrestrial origin to life on Earth. Mulder begins suffering from <b>a</b> <b>headache</b> and is unable to hear Scully speak, a condition seemingly caused by the rubbing. At the university, the agents meet Dr. Barnes—the man who posed as Sandoz—who professes disbelief in his theories. Mulder's condition worsens, but he refuses {{to go to the}} hospital and, due to seeming telepathic abilities, realizes that Barnes murdered Merkmallen. Later, in Mulder's office, Chuck Burks tells them that the symbols on the artifact are from Navajo.|$|E

5|$|While Walter and Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) {{ensure that}} the witness is safe at the hospital, Olivia takes Peter back to the lab. Peter, {{suffering}} from <b>a</b> <b>headache,</b> takes an aspirin and drinks out of what he believes to be an ordinary bottle of milk from the fridge. In reality, the milk contains a serum developed by Walter {{in order to help}} him recover his full mental function. However, the serum was incorrectly prepared, which causes Peter to begin convulsing. Over the phone, Walter directs Olivia to inject Peter with the correct compounds in order to save his life. Walter realizes that the serum would have killed him if he had consumed it, and that this was another step in the Observer's plot. Later that evening, September meets with another Observer, and identifies the fact that Walter was able to let Peter go, despite believing that he may not survive, and that when the time comes, they can expect Walter to do it again.|$|E
5|$|Multistage rocket: Although {{there is}} still some {{ambiguity}} as to whether the earliest rockets of the 13th century were first developed in Europe (i.e. 'ignis volantis in aere' in the work of Marcus Graecus around 1232, although Needham and Davis assert it was most likely a fire lance), the Middle East (i.e. 'sahm al-Khitāi' or 'arrows of China' as referred to by Hasan al-Rhammāh in 1280) or China (i.e. 'di lao shu' or 'ground rat' mentioned in 1264 or the 'chong' mortar used by the armies of the Song Dynasty and invading Mongols during the 1270s), during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) the term 'fire arrow' once implied to mean incendiary arrows during the Tang Dynasty was then used to describe the true rocket, producing <b>a</b> <b>headache,</b> as Needham says, for historians; the Huolongjing written by military officer Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and the Song dynasty Chinese philosopher and politician Liu Bowen (1311–1375) during the early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) described several types of rockets, one of them being a multistage rocket known as the 'huo long chu shui' or 'fire dragon issuing from the water' which, despite its name, was not launched from beneath the water from a primitive submarine but rather at near water-level maintaining a flat trajectory; defined as a two-stage rocket, it employed booster rockets that, when about to burn out of use, ignited a swarm of smaller rocket arrows fired from {{the front end of the}} missile shaped as a dragon's mouth.|$|E
5|$|While {{walking around}} her house, Thea finds a map {{in her room}} of Gracehope. The map shows a tunnel leading onto the surface. Thea and her cousin Mattias find the tunnel and meet Peter who helps them back to Gracehope. Reaching Gracehope, Peter realizes that several talismans {{of the people are}} in the shape of {{mitochondrial}} DNA, which his mom is studying. After waking up from <b>a</b> <b>headache,</b> Peter finds his mom next to his bed. She explains that she used to live in Gracehope, but was banished with her sister, after her sister ventured above the surface and contracted an illness that could not be cured. She also explains that her research of mitochondrial DNA relates to the ability of mutations to benefit the human body, which could cause their extremely good vision and hearing. In the end, she warns Peter that global warming is causing Gracehope to slowly melt away. The entire colony must learn the dangers they face and escape. One obstacle lies in their way: Rowen, Thea and Peter's grandmother who banished Peter's mom and did nothing to help Thea's mom when she was on her deathbed from an illness when she ventured aboveground. Rowen {{is the head of the}} Council in Gracehope and is strictly against going aboveground.|$|E

50|$|Sub{{arachnoid}} hemorrhage, which {{occur between}} the arachnoid and pia meningeal layers, like intraparenchymal hemorrhage, can result either from trauma or from ruptures of aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations. Blood is seen layering {{into the brain}} along sulci and fissures, or filling cisterns (most often the suprasellar cistern {{because of the presence}} of the vessels of the circle of Willis and their branchpoints within that space). The classic presentation of subarachnoid hemorrhage is the sudden onset of <b>a</b> severe <b>headache</b> (<b>a</b> thunderclap <b>headache).</b> This can be a very dangerous entity, and requires emergent neurosurgical evaluation, and sometimes urgent intervention.|$|R
