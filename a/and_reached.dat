40|$|This paper uses firm-level data {{to examine}} the impact of foreign {{chemical}} safety regulations such as RoHS <b>and</b> <b>REACH</b> on the production costs and export performance of firms in Malaysia and Vietnam. This paper also investigates the role of global value chains in enhancing the likelihood that a firm complies with RoHS <b>and</b> <b>REACH.</b> We find that in addition to the initial setup costs for compliance, EU RoHS (REACH) implementation imposes on firms additional variable production costs by requiring additional labor and capital expenditures of around 57 % (73 %) of variable costs. We also find that compliance with RoHS <b>and</b> <b>REACH</b> significantly increases the probability of export and that compliance with EU RoHS <b>and</b> <b>REACH</b> helps firms enter a greater variety of countries. Furthermore, firms participating in global value chains have higher compliance with RoHS <b>and</b> <b>REACH</b> regulations, regardless of whether the firm is directly exporting, when the firm operates in upstream or downstream industries of the countries' supply chain...|$|R
