5|$|The term {{titanate}}s usually {{refers to}} titanium(IV) compounds, <b>as</b> <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> barium titanate (BaTiO3). With a perovskite structure, this material exhibits piezoelectric properties {{and is used}} as a transducer in the interconversion of sound and electricity. Many minerals are titanates, e.g. ilmenite (FeTiO3). Star sapphires and rubies get their asterism (star-forming shine) from the presence of titanium dioxide impurities.|$|E

The publication noted the irony that in order to achieve the goal, the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast, centralized government bureaucracy.|$|E

5|$|Diptera were {{traditionally}} {{broken down}} into two suborders, Nematocera and Brachycera, distinguished by the differences in antennae. The Nematocera are recognized by their elongated bodies and many-segmented, often feathery antennae <b>as</b> <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> mosquitoes and crane flies. The Brachycera have rounder bodies and much shorter antennae. Subsequent studies have identified the Nematocera as being non-monophyletic with modern phylogenies placing the Brachycera within grades of groups formerly placed in the Nematocera. The construction of a phylogenetic tree {{has been the subject}} of ongoing research. The following cladogram is based on the FLYTREE project.|$|E
5|$|For {{purposes}} of Pan American Games competition, the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) makes {{a distinction between}} sports and disciplines. A sport, in Pan American Games terms, is a single or group of disciplines <b>as</b> <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> an international governing body, namely an International Federation. For example, aquatics, represented at the Olympic level by the International Swimming Federation, is a sport at the Pan American Games that includes the swimming, diving, synchronized swimming and water polo disciplines.|$|E
5|$|In England, Parliament held James {{abandoned}} the throne by fleeing from English territory to France. The Convention argued James forfeited the Scottish throne by his actions, as {{listed in the}} Articles of Grievances. This effectively rejected {{the principle of the}} Divine Right of Kings which had driven political conflict for the last 60 years. If James could be removed from the throne because of his acts, monarchs derived their legitimacy not from God but the people <b>as</b> <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> Parliament.|$|E

5|$|In the 6th {{or early}} 7th century a natural {{disaster}} caused a devastating flood of the Motagua Valley and buried {{the surface of the}} site under a deep layer of silt, completely changing the landscape. Only those buildings that stood above the mud continued in use, including group A, saved by its hilltop location. The earthen platform on the valley floor also continued in use, at least those parts of it that stood above the silt, {{and it was one of}} the site's smaller complexes that grew to become the new centre of Quiriguá, <b>as</b> <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> the monuments visible to this day.|$|E
5|$|Some Heathens {{celebrate}} the eight festivals {{found in the}} Wheel of the Year, a tradition that they share with Wiccans and other contemporary Pagan groups. Others celebrate only six of these festivals, <b>as</b> <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> a six-spoked Wheel of the Year. The use of such festivals is criticized by other practitioners, who highlight that this system is of modern, mid-20th century origin and does not link with the original religious celebrations of the pre-Christian Germanic world.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} (<b>as</b> <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> the {{nominate}} subspecies T. p. philomelos) is 20 to 23.5centimetres (8 to 9.25in) {{in length and}} weighs 50–107grammes (1.8 to 3.8oz). The sexes are similar, with plain brown backs and neatly black-spotted cream or yellow-buff underparts, becoming paler on the belly. The underwing is warm yellow, the bill is yellowish and the legs and feet are pink. The upperparts of this species become colder in tone from west to east across the breeding range from Sweden to Siberia. The juvenile resembles the adult, but has buff or orange streaks {{on the back and}} wing coverts.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} Achebean ending {{results in}} the destruction of an individual and, by synecdoche, the downfall of the community. Odili's descent into the luxury of corruption and hedonism in A Man of the People, for example, is symbolic of the post-colonial crisis in Nigeria and elsewhere. Even with the emphasis on colonialism, however, Achebe's tragic endings embody the traditional confluence of fate, individual and society, <b>as</b> <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> Sophocles and Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|The unnamed half-female form of Shiva is also {{alluded to}} in the epic Mahabharata. In Book XIII, Upamanyu praises Shiva rhetorically asking if there is anyone else whose half-body is shared by his spouse, and adds that the {{universe}} had risen from the union of sexes, <b>as</b> <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> Shiva's half-female form. In some narratives, Shiva is described as dark and fair-complexioned, half yellow and half white, half woman and half man, and both woman and man. In Book XIII, Shiva preaches to Parvati that half of his body {{is made up of}} her body.|$|E

5|$|Despite Mihardja's {{insistence that}} Atheis {{is meant to}} be realistic, several {{symbolic}} interpretations have been put forward. According to Mihardja, {{one of the most common}} interpretations readers conveyed to him was that Hasan's death symbolised atheism defeating religion, with Hasan's death as the death of theism. According to Maier, Atheis serves as an allegory for the development of the Indonesian nation. Hasan, representing traditionalism, is killed by the Japanese, who changed the status quo when they invaded in 1942. Meanwhile, the anarchistic Anwar finds himself without a place in the modern world. Only the responsible modern character, Rusli, is able to bring the Indonesian nation, <b>as</b> <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> Kartini, to terms with the new world.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the founders}} were {{educated in the}} {{classical}} tradition, and used classical models for landmarks and buildings in Washington, D.C., to avoid the feudal and religious connotations of European architecture such as castles and cathedrals. In forming their theory of the mixed constitution, the founders looked to Athenian democracy and Roman republicanism for models, but regarded the Roman emperor as a figure of tyranny. They nonetheless adopted Roman Imperial forms such as the dome, <b>as</b> <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> the US Capitol and numerous state capitol buildings, to express classical ideals through architecture. Thomas Jefferson saw the Empire as a negative political lesson, but was a chief proponent of its architectural models. Jefferson's design for the Virginia State Capitol, for instance, is modelled directly from the Maison Carrée, a Gallo-Roman temple built under Augustus. The renovations of the National Mall {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century have been viewed as expressing a more overt imperialist kinship with Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevalent}} {{opinion is}} that the church was constructed and painted in the early 14th century, which coincides with the lifetimes of the individuals most widely accepted <b>as</b> <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> the figures depicted in the church's frescoes. At the time, the village of Donja Kamenica, along {{with much of the}} Timočka Krajina region, belonged to the Vidin appanage of the Second Bulgarian Empire. However, alternative theories place the construction of the church in the mid-14th century, the mid-15th century or even the 16th century. The church and its frescoes were restored in 1958. The church was declared a Monument of Culture of Great Importance in 1982, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.|$|E

5|$|The {{site had}} a long and {{continuous}} settlement history, with the period of principal occupation stretching from the Middle Preclassic down to the Postclassic. The earliest known occupation at Takalik Abaj dates {{towards the end of}} the Early Preclassic, ca. 1000 BC. However, it was not until the Middle to Late Preclassic that its first real florescence began with a noted surge in architectural constructions. From this period onwards a continuity of culture and population settlement is in evidence, <b>as</b> <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> the persistence of a local ceramic style (called Ocosito) that remained in use until the Late Classic. The Ocosito style was typically made with red paste and pumice and extended westwards at least as far as Coatepeque, southwards to the Ocosito River and eastwards to the Samalá River. By the Terminal Classic, pottery associated with a highland K'iche' ceramic style had begun to appear intermixed with Ocosito ceramic complex deposits. Ocosito ceramics were replaced entirely by the K'iche' ceramic tradition by the Early Postclassic period.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of nations, <b>as</b> <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> National Olympic Committees (NOCs), {{that have}} participated in the Winter Olympic Games between 1924 and 2014.

Including continuity from Czechoslovakia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have also been represented in every edition.|$|E
5|$|The {{dramatic}} {{contrast between}} Ranavalona's isolationism and her son's pro-European stance represented an abrupt reversal of policy that threatened the traditional sociopolitical order. Radama's absolutism in pursuing dramatic reforms in disregard {{of the advice}} of his ministers ultimately turned them against him. In a coup led by his Prime Minister, Rainivoninahitriniony, Radama II was strangled on May 12, 1863. His wife Rabodo, who took the throne name Rasoherina, was allowed by the ministers to succeed her husband on the condition that she and future sovereigns would no longer rule unilaterally, but rather in concert with the Hova (the class of free citizens) <b>as</b> <b>represented</b> <b>by</b> the position of Prime Minister. The public was informed that Radama had committed suicide and that his body had been unceremoniously interred in a tomb in Ilafy. However, there soon emerged rumors – believed by prominent foreigners Jean Laborde and William Ellis – that Radama lived and was making plans to reclaim the throne. A strong case has since been {{made on the basis of}} significant evidence that Radama may indeed have revived after the strangling and lived to old age in anonymity near Lake Kinkony in the northwestern part of the island.|$|E
