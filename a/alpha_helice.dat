50|$|Fam83H is {{primarily}} composed of <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> and random coils. <b>Alpha</b> <b>helices</b> comprise {{the majority of}} the protein. There is a transmembrane domain from 231-252.|$|R
40|$|Elucidation of the {{detailed}} structural features and sequence requirements for <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> of various lengths {{could be very}} important in understanding secondary structure formation in proteins and, hence, in the protein folding mechanism. An algorithm to characterize the geometry of an alpha helix from its C(alpha) coordinates has been developed and {{used to analyze the}} structures of long <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> (number of residues > or = 25) found in globular proteins, the crystal structure coordinates of which are available from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. All long <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> can be unambiguously characterized as belonging to one of three classes: linear, curved, or kinked, with a majority being curved. Analysis of the sequences of these helices reveals that the long <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> have unique sequence characteristics that distinguish them from the short <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> in globular proteins. The distribution and statistical propensities of individual amino acids to occur in long <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> are different from those found in short <b>alpha</b> <b>helices,</b> with amino acids having longer side chains and/or having a greater number of functional groups occurring more frequently in these helices. The sequences of the long <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> can be correlated with their gross structural features, i. e., whether they are curved, linear, or kinked, and in case of the curved helices, with their curvature...|$|R
50|$|Serine sidechains {{are often}} {{hydrogen}} bonded; the commonest small motifs formed are ST turns, ST motifs (often {{at the beginning}} of <b>alpha</b> <b>helices)</b> and ST staples (usually at the middle of <b>alpha</b> <b>helices).</b>|$|R
50|$|The N {{terminus}} {{is predicted}} to have multiple <b>alpha</b> <b>helices,</b> though the C terminus likely is only coiled. The <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> do not form any channel, and FAM98A is not a transmembrane protein.|$|R
50|$|The Ter protein {{contains}} two domains. The N-terminal domain {{is composed of}} an <b>alpha</b> <b>helices,</b> beta sandwich, and three loops. The C-terminal domain is made of two <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> and one beta sheet.|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of the structure is composed of <b>alpha</b> <b>helices.</b> As predicted my Phyre 2, 61% of the protein forms <b>alpha</b> <b>helices,</b> and 28% forms transmembrane segments. A detailed map of the transmembrane topology is shown below.|$|R
50|$|PROSER1 is {{composed}} primarily of <b>alpha</b> <b>helices,</b> beta sheets, and coils. The protein is largely coiled. The DUF {{is composed}} mainly of <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> and coils. It has slightly fewer beta sheets {{compared to the}} protein as a whole.|$|R
50|$|The CHASE domain has a {{predicted}} alpha+beta fold, {{with two}} extended <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> on both boundaries and two central <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> separated by beta sheets.

5000|$|Type 2: G protein-coupled receptors (metabotropic) - This is {{the largest}} family of receptors and {{includes}} the receptors for several hormones and slow transmitters e.g. dopamine, metabotropic glutamate. They are composed of seven transmembrane <b>alpha</b> <b>helices.</b> The loops connecting the <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> form extracellular and intracellular domains. The binding-site for larger peptide ligands is usually located in the extracellular domain whereas the binding site for smaller non-peptide ligands is often located between the seven <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> and one extracellular loop.

5000|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{studies have}} revealed that the structure of Halothermothrix orenii SPS belongs to the GT-B fold family. Like other GT-B proteins, SPS contains two Rossman fold domains that are named the A domain and the B domain. Generally, the structure of these domains are somewhat similar, as both contain central beta sheets that are surrounded by <b>alpha</b> <b>helices.</b> However, the A domain consists of eight parallel beta strands and seven <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> while the B domain contains six parallel beta strands and nine <b>alpha</b> <b>helices.</b> These domains are joined by residue loops to form a substrate binding cleft, where the glucosyl group acceptor binds.|$|R
40|$|A {{chimeric}} class I glycoprotein {{was created}} to investigate the functional contribution of the <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> and the beta-pleated sheets in forming the antigen recognition site (ARS) of antigen- presenting molecules. This novel molecule was generated by replacing the DNA sequences encoding the <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> of the Ld gene with the corresponding sequences from the Kb gene. Serologic analysis of transfected L cells that expressed the chimeric molecule (Kb alpha Ld beta) revealed that the engineered class I glycoprotein retains two conformational epitopes associated with the <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> of Kb, as defined by monoclonal antibodies K 10. 56 and 28 - 13 - 3. These results demonstrate that the <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> of Kb can associate with the beta- pleated sheets of Ld to form a stable structure, which is expressed on the cell surface. To address {{the role of the}} <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> of the ARS in determining T cell crossreactivity, alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were used to analyze L cells expressing Kb alpha Ld beta. CTL raised against Kb or Ld as alloantigens showed little, if any, ability to lyse L cells expressing Kb alpha Ld beta. Thus, alloreactive CTL did not recognize structures determined by the <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> alone or by the beta sheets of the ARS alone. However, bulk and cloned alloreactive CTL that were generated against the mutant Kb glycoprotein Kbm 8 reacted strongly with Kb alpha Ld beta. In addition to the Kb <b>alpha</b> <b>helices,</b> the Kbm 8 ARS shares a single polymorphic amino acid at position 24 with Kb alpha Ld beta. Amino acid 24 is located on the beta 2 strand that forms part of the floor of the ARS and has been identified as a component of pocket B in the HLA class I ARS. The substitution of Glu to Ser at this position was shown previously to be the central determinant of the Kbm 8 mutant alloantigenicity. The functional significance of this position in determining crossreactivity between bm 8 and Kb alpha Ld beta identifies pocket B as a strong anchor for allogenic self-peptides. These findings demonstrate that determinants recognized by CTL on class I alloantigens are formed by interactions involving both the <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> and beta sheets of the ARS. These interactions are best explained by the influence of the <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> and beta sheets on the peptide-binding properties of these antigen-presenting molecules...|$|R

50|$|Currently {{of three}} known classes of halohydrin dehalogenases, only {{two have been}} {{described}} by x-ray crystallography studies. However, both of these classes have similar structure which {{can be described as}} follows(1): a halohydrin dehalogenase is structured as a tetramer with a symmetry characteristic of a dimer of dimers. Each monomeric subunit consists of seven <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> and nine beta-sheets. These monomers interact via the two longest <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> to form an alpha-helical bundle to form a dimer. The final quaternary structure is formed when two dimers interact via a different set of <b>alpha</b> <b>helices</b> and anti-parallel beta-sheets; interactions between the beta-sheets are thought to be a combination of both hydrophobic and electrostatic attraction.|$|R
