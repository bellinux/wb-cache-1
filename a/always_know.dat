5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to <b>always</b> <b>know</b> what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E

25|$|The Neapolitan Mastiff {{is not a}} breed {{for most}} people, and {{certainly}} not a dog for beginners. Neapolitans must be well socialized with people (especially children), as they are large, powerful dogs and do not <b>always</b> <b>know</b> their own strength. Additionally, young children have young friends, and even with extensive socialization and training, Neapolitans will be wary of strangers and protective of their family, which can be disastrous for small children. Most of the time, they will protect their owners with their lives.|$|E

25|$|In each episode, Dolly Singh {{creates a}} video diary {{containing}} advice for Nikki about {{their family and}} life as a teenager. Dolly tries to show Nikki what she might go through in the video diary so she will <b>always</b> <b>know</b> how to figure things out, even in Dolly's absence. In the third season of the show, Nikki's younger sibling Bobby is born. The show went on hiatus on November8, 2015, and later showed the remaining episodes at 9p.m. on Disney Channel India. The show went on hiatus to give airtime to Vicky & Vetaal season two, which began airing on November15, 2015.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} must {{fit their}} context. All reputable calligraphers in China were well educated and well read. In addition to calligraphy, they were skilled in other areas, most likely painting, poetry, music, opera, martial arts, and Go. Therefore, their abundant education {{contributed to their}} calligraphy. A calligrapher practicing another calligrapher's characters would <b>always</b> <b>know</b> what the text means, when it was created, and in what circumstances. When they write, their characters' shape and weight agrees with {{the rhythm of the}} phrases, especially in less constrained styles such as semi-cursive and cursive. One who does not know the meaning of the characters they write, but varies their shape and weight on a whim, does not produce good calligraphy.|$|E
500|$|James Poniewozik of The New York Times {{called the}} series [...] "sharply written, but its visual panache {{is the big}} surprise", praising the [...] "groovy, 1960s-70s retro-futuristic look" [...] and soundtrack. He concluded, [...] "You will not <b>always</b> <b>know</b> what's real in Legion, but the thrills are 100 percent genuine." [...] Writing for The Guardian, Emily Zemler said that Hawley's {{representation}} of Haller's mind and perspective on reality was [...] "the strength of Legion ... It’s disjointed on purpose, and there’s something deeply satisfying in the edge that gives the viewer. It’s not a comfortable watch, but it doesn’t need to be." [...] Zemler did warn that the series may be disorienting for viewers with no context or knowledge of the character's comic origins.|$|E

500|$|Some reviews {{were less}} favorable. David Ansen of Newsweek said, [...] "While one respects the filmmaker's small-is-beautiful philosophy, this story {{may indeed be}} too small for its britches.... Beresford's nice little movie seems so afraid to make a false move that it runs the danger of not moving at all." [...] Linda Beath of The Globe and Mail said Duvall's {{performance}} was [...] "fabulous," [...] but that the film was [...] "very slight" [...] compared to Beresford's Australian pictures. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post panned the film, criticizing its mood and tempo and describing Buckley as its only true asset: [...] "Tender Mercies fails because of an apparent dimness of perception that frequently overcomes dramatists: they don't <b>always</b> <b>know</b> when they've got ahold of {{the wrong end of}} the story they want to tell." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{complexity}} of the script of the pilot episode and the show's concept was cited as a potential issue for the series. Salke evaluated that viewers will enjoy the [...] "clever mythology that overlap and affect each other in very interesting ways", despite the series' Sliding Doors-like script. Upon reading the script, Isaacs {{felt that it was}} [...] "incredibly hard" [...] and complicated to comprehend. [...] "Do you <b>always</b> <b>know</b> what reality you're in? [...] That's become a [...] It was hard but I quite like hard work." [...] Isaacs later suggested that it might be too brooding for mainstream American television, and that it could potentially be the [...] "U-bend of scripts". He stated that every pilot comes from people who have [...] "amazing prestige", and that there are lots of [...] "talented people, but the head of the network chooses only one." [...] Despite such concerns, Gordon asserted that the concept of Awake was a concept that you could understand if you sat down and paid attention to it properly.|$|E

500|$|Jenna tells Liz {{that she}} wants to {{accompany}} her to her singles activities as her wingman since she is up for a role in National Lampoon's Van Wilder's Wingman, Incorporated, a reference to the National Lampoon's Van Wilder film series. Avery and Jack attend a gala opening at a museum, and upon seeing the decorations and well dressed patrons, Avery remarks that [...] "You <b>always</b> <b>know</b> you're at the right party when it feels like the Riddler is about to attack", the Riddler is a comic book villain who leaves behind riddles, puzzles, and word games {{so that they can be}} solved. While posing for pictures at the gala, a photographer mistakes Avery for stand-up comedian Chelsea Handler, which has been based on real life experience for Elizabeth Banks, who portrays Avery, as she has been mistaken for Handler. When Liz tells Jack that he cannot date both Avery and Nancy at the same time, she says [...] "Mrs. Doubtfire shimself could not do this", a reference to actor Robin Williams' role in the movie Mrs. Doubtfire, in which he plays two roles, one as a man and the other as a woman named Mrs. Doubtfire.|$|E
500|$|Rick Porter of Zap2it worried how {{the series}} would fit in [...] "the likes" [...] of Elvis Costello, Mary J. Blige, Sheryl Crow, Clay Aiken and Adam Levine [...] "without it {{overwhelming}} the episode", {{and reported that}} the answer to that [...] "turned out to be 'very effectively.'" [...] In regards to the storylines, itself, he noted that Jack's quest in getting Milton a kidney [...] "balanced nicely" [...] with Liz's story, and that Tracy's [...] "had some good moments". In conclusion, Porter wrote [...] "For a show that doesn't <b>always</b> <b>know</b> how to end episodes, it's done really well at ending seasons." [...] TV Guide Magazine’s Sandra Kofler wrote that the [...] "He Needs a Kidney" [...] song was hilarious, and that it [...] "stole [...] season finale." [...] Patrick Goldstein, a contributor for the Los Angeles Times, was favorable to the musical number, reporting [...] "he song itself is a hoot, highlighted by a wonderful spoken-word kidney donation pitch that begins with Costello saying: 'Listen, when someone starts talking {{in the middle of a}} song, you know it's serious.'" [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett said [...] "Kidney Now!" [...] was [...] "sweet and all", and noted that the [...] "Vontella-as-Tyra spoof" [...] was [...] "brilliant." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik wrote that this episode [...] "was a fitting end for a guest-star-heavy... season of 30 Rock", but added that the finale overall was [...] "maybe average", however, [...] "the ending at least delivered the goods, with the best sitcom celebrity benefit song".|$|E

It is not that these types of experiences make you a better person, but they give you a different perspective on failure.
