25|$|With the {{exception}} of Someone's Watching Me!, Elvis, The Thing, Starman, Memoirs of an Invisible Man, and The Ward, he has scored all of his films (though some are collaborations), most famously the themes from Halloween and Assault on Precinct 13. His music is generally synthesized with accompaniment from piano and <b>atmospherics.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{a trip to}} Venice in 1880, Whistler {{created a}} series of {{etchings}} and pastels that not only reinvigorated his finances, but also re-energized {{the way in which}} artists and photographers interpreted the city—focusing on the back alleys, side canals, entrance ways, and architectural patterns—and capturing the city's unique <b>atmospherics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hill {{states that}} space music {{is used by}} some {{individuals}} for both background enhancement and foreground listening, often with headphones, to enable states of relaxation, contemplation, inspiration, and generally peaceful expansive moods; it may promote health through relaxation, <b>atmospherics</b> for bodywork therapies, and effectiveness of meditation. Space music appears in many film soundtracks and is commonly played in planetariums.|$|E
25|$|The next album Street Fighting Years (produced by Trevor Horn and Stephen Lipson) {{moved away}} from the American soul and gospel {{influences}} of Once Upon a Time in favour of soundtrack <b>atmospherics</b> and a new incorporation of acoustic and folk music-related ingredients. The lyrics were also more directly political, covering topics including the Poll Tax, the Soweto townships, the Berlin Wall and the stationing of nuclear submarines on the Scottish coast.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, Ned Lagin {{released}} {{an album of}} electronic noise music full of spacey rumblings and <b>atmospherics</b> filled with burps and bleeps entitled Seastones on Round Records. The album was recorded in stereo quadraphonic sound and featured guest performances {{by members of the}} Grateful Dead, including Jerry Garcia playing treated guitar and Phil Lesh playing electronic Alembic bass. David Crosby, Grace Slick {{and other members of the}} Jefferson Airplane also appear on the album.|$|E
25|$|A trance {{refers to}} a state of hypnotism and {{heightened}} consciousness. This is portrayed in trance music by the mixing of layers with distinctly foreshadowed build-up and release. A common characteristic of trance music is a mid-song climax followed by a soft breakdown disposing of beats and percussion entirely, leaving the melody or <b>atmospherics</b> to stand alone for an extended period before gradually building up again. Trance tracks are often lengthy to allow for such progression and commonly have sufficiently sparse opening and closing sections to facilitate mixing by DJs.|$|E
25|$|The {{availability}} of small inexpensive computing platforms, LEDs, and compact powerful batteries allows special effects {{to be built}} into props, costumes, and scenery. Lighting, <b>atmospherics,</b> sounds, even motorized movement can be programmed into devices and controlled by the actors or remotely. WiFi and Bluetooth devices allow for wireless communication between the control console and the effect. For example, the LEDs built into a dress can be remotely illuminated; the console can even tell them what color to emit. Costumes in Head Over Heels (a musical by Lolita Snipes), The Wiz, and The Winter's Tale are recent examples of wireless control. Lanterns, candles, fireflies, and other effects built into props and scenery also utilize embedded electronics.|$|E
25|$|In comparison, LORAN was {{deliberately}} {{designed to allow}} skywaves to be used, and the resulting received signal was far more complex. The groundwave remained fairly sharp, but could be received only at shorter distances and was primarily used during the day. At night, as many as thirty different skywaves might be received from a single transmitter, often overlapped in time, creating a complex return pattern. Since the pattern depended on the <b>atmospherics</b> between the transmitter and receiver, the received pattern was different for the two stations. One might receive a two-bounce skywave from one station {{in the same time}} as a three-bounce wave from another, making interpretation of the display quite difficult.|$|E
25|$|Witch {{house is}} a debated term {{referring}} to a fusion genre of industrial music that features a prominent hip-hop influence, specifically the 1990s Houston chopped and screwed sound pioneered by DJ Screw. Witch house consists of applying techniques rooted in Swishahouse hip-hop – drastically slowed tempos with skipping, stop-timed beats – with signifiers of noise, drone, or shoegaze, the genre recontextualizes its forebears into a sinister, unprecedented, yet aesthetically referential atmosphere. Witch {{house is a}}lso influenced by hazy 1980s goth bands, including Cocteau Twins, The Cure and Dead Can Dance, {{as well as being}} heavily influenced by certain early industrial bands. The use of hip-hop drum machines, noise <b>atmospherics,</b> creepy samples, synthpop-influenced lead melodies, and heavily altered or distorted vocals is also common.|$|E

500|$|The Irish Times placed Crowley {{at number}} eight in {{a list of}} [...] "The 50 Best Irish Acts Right Now" [...] {{published}} in April 2009, noting his [...] "majestic songs, rich voice and subtle blend of <b>atmospherics</b> and master-level wordplay".|$|E
500|$|... "I'll Remember" [...] had {{multiple}} projection screen fills and classic theatre <b>atmospherics</b> (like smoke haze and the flickering light beams from a projection booth) added. The theatre {{walls and ceiling}} had digital enhancements. A sound booth was completely created from scratch to accompany a crane shot down to Madonna. All the movie inserts were treated {{to appear to be}} within the theater and all Madonna's close ups and medium shots were individually treated for facial beauty enhancements.|$|E
500|$|Desson Thomson of The Washington Post {{praised the}} art {{direction}} and set design. [...] "Willis and Pitts's performances, Gilliam's <b>atmospherics</b> and an exhilarating momentum easily outweigh such trifling {{flaws in the}} script", Thomson reasoned. Peter Travers from Rolling Stone magazine cited the film's success on Gilliam's direction and Willis' performance. Internet reviewer James Berardinelli believed the filmmakers took an intelligent and creative motive for the time travel subplot. Rather than being sent to change the past, James Cole is instead observing it {{to make a better}} future. Richard Corliss of Time magazine felt the film's time travel aspect and apocalyptic depiction of a bleaker future were clichés. [...] "In its frantic mix of chaos, carnage and zoo animals, 12 Monkeys is Jumanji for adults", Corliss wrote.|$|E
500|$|As {{a self-proclaimed}} [...] "fan of multitracking", Townsend has {{developed}} a trademark production style featuring an atmospheric, layered [...] "wall of sound". Townsend has drawn critical praise for his productions, which [...] "are always marked {{by a sense of}} adventure, intrigue, chaotic <b>atmospherics</b> and overall aural pyrotechnics", according to Mike G. of Metal Maniacs. Townsend mainly uses Pro Tools to produce his music, alongside other software suites such as Steinberg Cubase, Ableton Live, and Logic Pro. Townsend's musical ideas and production style have drawn comparisons to Phil Spector and Frank Zappa. Townsend has carried out the mixing and mastering for most of his solo work himself. He has also mixed and remixed work for other artists such as Rammstein, August Burns Red and Misery Signals.|$|E
500|$|Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media {{praised the}} album in his review, writing that it [...] "works best as a swirling, disorienting whole," [...] and [...] "those drawn to his lovesick, {{evolving}} audio presence have…an entire world to explore." [...] Dominic Umile of PopMatters found the album's [...] "lovesickness and confessions" [...] to be [...] "as tenderly delivered as its hazy <b>atmospherics</b> are", and, in their [...] "bare authenticity…far more compelling in repeat indulgences than Deerhunter’s explorations." [...] Tiny Mix Tapes rewarded the album 4/5 stars, saying that, while each song has a [...] "distinctive quality" [...] {{allowing it to}} stand on its own, by backing out to view the album as a whole, the [...] "individual elements unify…mak a greater holistic product." ...|$|E
500|$|Max Feldman of PopMatters awarded Laborintus II {{a rating}} of seven out of ten, finding Berio's {{composition}} [...] "challenging" [...] and [...] "exhausting". He noted the work's free jazz elements, comparing it to the 1970 Miles Davis album Bitches Brew. Feldman felt that the music [...] "constantly emphasises its own unpredictability". Consequence of Sound's Carson O'Shoney rated the album three stars out of five, calling it [...] "unlike anything else you’ve ever heard". O'Shoney felt that the music might need more than one hearing to appreciate it, adding that it [...] "runs the gauntlet from quiet, jazzy <b>atmospherics</b> to brazen, unsettling primal noise". A review for Q magazine described Laborintus II as [...] "tedious", finding the album disorienting. Spin Christopher R. Weingarten rated it 7 out of 10, calling it an [...] "orchestra/tape collision crisper".|$|E
500|$|Del Rey {{performed}} [...] "West Coast" [...] wearing kohl-smudged eye makeup, a tie-dye sundress and hoop earrings, {{as part of}} {{her debut}} set list for the Glastonbury Festival 2014 on June 28. The rendition was accompanied by visuals from the song's music video as Del Rey's backdrop. Hutchinson described the performance as [...] "actionless loveliness" [...] and commended its [...] "burbling guitars, hazy <b>atmospherics,</b> perfect cooing, [...] epic drums". Mark Savage of BBC News said the rendition was [...] "suitably dramatic". At a date of her promotional tour, in Cork on July 15, 2014, Del Rey draped herself in the flag of Ireland during her performance of [...] "West Coast". [...] Del Rey also sang [...] "West Coast" [...] at the Austin City Limits Music Festival on October 4, 2014. The track was later reprised during her two-date gig at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, beginning on October 17, 2014.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{recorded}} the basic track for [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)" [...] at A Studios in Hollywood between 21 April and 7 May. Harrison played 12-string acoustic guitar, {{with support from}} David Foster on piano, and sparse, floor tom-heavy drumming from Jim Keltner. Klaus Voormann, Harrison's regular bass player and a friend since the Beatles' Hamburg years, chose to not participate {{in many of the}} sessions for Extra Texture, later citing the abundance of cocaine and Harrison's [...] "frame of mind when he was doing this album". Harrison overdubbed the song's bass part using an ARP synthesizer, while Gary Wright provided the ARP strings <b>atmospherics,</b> a sound that characterised his hit album The Dream Weaver around this time. In the description of author Andrew Grant Jackson, the song's opening synthesizer part [...] "wouldn't sound out of place in a '70s horror flick or a Death Wish sequel".|$|E
500|$|The band {{wanted to}} build on the textures of The Unforgettable Fire, but in {{contrast}} to that record's often out-of-focus experimentation, they sought a harder-hitting sound within the limitations of conventional song structures. The group referred to this approach as working within the [...] "primary colours" [...] of rock music—guitar, bass, and drums. Guitarist the Edge was more interested in the European <b>atmospherics</b> of The Unforgettable Fire and was initially reluctant to follow Bono's lead to seek a more American sound. The Edge was eventually convinced after discovering blues and country artists such as Howlin' Wolf, Robert Johnson, Hank Williams, and Lefty Frizzell on American public radio stations during the Unforgettable Fire Tour. Despite lacking a consensus on musical direction, the group members agreed that they felt disconnected from the dominant synthpop and new wave music of the time, and they wanted to continue making music that contrasted with these genres.|$|E
500|$|Led Zeppelin II also {{features}} experimentation with other musical styles and approaches, {{as on the}} alternately soft-and-loud [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be" [...] and [...] "Ramble On" [...] (which featured Page's acoustic guitar), or the pop-influenced ballad [...] "Thank You". With its mysterious <b>atmospherics,</b> [...] "Ramble On" [...] helped develop hard rock's association with fantasy themes, which had been partly derived from the psychedelic rock genre of {{two to three years}} before, but also from Plant's personal interest in the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien. This musical direction would later culminate on Led Zeppelin IV (and countless subsequent groups would later carry the influence to further extremes). Conversely, the instrumental [...] "Moby Dick" [...] features an extended drum solo by John Bonham, which would be extended further during Led Zeppelin concert performances sometimes for as long as half an hour.|$|E
500|$|Rubin {{encouraged}} a [...] "back to basics" [...] approach and wanted {{the group to}} bring finished songs to the studio. This approach conflicted with U2's freeform recording style, by which they improvised material in the studio. The Edge said, [...] "we sort of hadn't really finished the songs. It's typical for us, because it's {{in the process of}} recording that we really do our writing." [...] Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "once we have a song, we're interested in the <b>atmospherics</b> and the tones and the overdubs and the different stuff you can do with it... things that Rick was not in the slightest bit interested in. He was interested in getting it from embryonic stage to a song that could be mixed and put on a record." [...] They ultimately decided to shelve the material recorded with Rubin, but expressed interest in revisiting it in the future.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} 45 seconds of soft synthesizers and {{ethereal}} vocals, somewhat akin in <b>atmospherics</b> to the group's early 1980s songs [...] "Tomorrow" [...] and [...] "Drowning Man"; during this, Bono laments that [...] "sometimes I feel like checking out." [...] This {{is followed by}} the entrance of drums and guitar in a familiar U2 rhythm, as Bono describes the burdens of love and how he is [...] "in the black; can't see or be seen." [...] Each verse culminates with the refrain [...] "Baby, baby, baby, light my way." [...] Flood, who engineered and mixed the recording, noted that there was considerable laughter and debate during the sessions about whether Bono could get away with singing the repeated [...] "baby"s, one of the most heavily used clichés in pop songs and one that he had avoided up to that point in his songwriting; Flood later commented that [...] "he got away with it alright." ...|$|E
500|$|Greg Kot of The Chicago Tribune {{noted that}} Rihanna assumes {{the role of}} playing the victim in the song, and not the offender, saying [...] "She's wary of men even when she’s flirting with them in Wait Your Turn." [...] Prior to Greenblatt's album review of Rated R, where she briefly commented on [...] "Wait Your Turn", she also {{reviewed}} the song when it leaked onto the Internet in early November, saying [...] "Now that the wait is nearly ova, are you feeling it, Music Mixers? I cannot tell a lie; I’m a little underwhelmed by this new walk-the-plank Pirate incarnation." [...] William Goodman of Spin magazine was more critical and dismissive of the song, saying [...] "Wait Your Turn'...leaked online over the weekend, and like the album's lead track, 'Russian Roulette,' it's a total let down: clunky, Auto-Tuned vocals repeat The wait is ova / The wait is ova ad nauseam, over dark <b>atmospherics</b> and a spare dub beat that fails to connect...it's certainly not worth the wait." ...|$|E
500|$|Hex Enduction Hour was {{the first}} Fall album to make the UK Albums Chart, where it spent three weeks, peaking at no. 71. By mid-1983 it had sold 20,000 copies, {{reflecting}} a surge in the band's popularity, and five years into their career {{brought them to the}} attention of record labels. Critics were highly enthusiastic; according to Simon Ford, they could [...] "have hardly been more supportive". Reviewing the album in the NME, Richard Cook described the band as tighter and more disciplined than in earlier recordings, [...] "their master piece to date", while still maintaining their impact. He praised the band's use of recording-studio techniques and <b>atmospherics</b> without resorting to glamorisation. Melody Makers Colin Irwin said it was [...] "incredibly exciting and utterly compelling". [...] A dissenter was Neil McCormick of Irish fortnightly Hot Press, who dismissed the album as secondhand melodramatic punk and wondered if the album was [...] "meant to be minimalist or primitive then it fatally ignores the true primitivism of the strong melody and accessible lyrics found in folk music." ...|$|E
500|$|Romeo Void has {{generally}} been classified as a new wave or post-punk band. Some critics have noted dance elements in the music. According to Stewart Mason, writing for Allmusic, [...] " [...] band's muscular blend of Joy Division's <b>atmospherics</b> and the Gang of Four's rattling momentum, with Benjamin Bossi's splattering free jazz saxophone coloring everything, made Romeo Void {{one of the strongest}} of the American post-punk bands. The St. Petersburg Times wrote that they [...] "had no trouble creating a signature sound for [...] scratchy guitar, soulful sax, [...] tight, precise drums." [...] The New York Times stated that they sounded like [...] "an art-school band, with its textural complexity [...] touches of jazz and funk" [...] Saxophone player Benjamin Bossi has been observed as the ingredient that [...] "set the band apart" [...] and showed a [...] "talent for both improvisation and arrangement." [...] Alan Niester, writing for The Globe and Mail, said that he weaved [...] "in and out [...] like a snake charmer" [...] and reminded him of Andy Mackay, a saxophonist that played with Roxy Music.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{reception}} {{ranged from}} positive to mixed. Critic Maureen Ryan was very {{positive about the}} episode in her blog at The Chicago Tribune, writing, [...] "I liked this week's episode, and for once, it wasn't a case of really wanting to like it {{and trying to find}} reasons to see past various flaws. I just enjoyed the hour and felt it had just the right mixture of creepiness and character development (plus, the Observer was awesome. If only they'd called him the Watcher, but let's not quibble)." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found [...] "The Arrival" [...] a noticeable improvement over previous episodes. [...] "...After being more than prepared to give [...] "Fringe That's It For Me! status going into the episode, I enjoyed the strangeness of it—The Observer's hairlessness and diet, Capt. Patterson from [...] "Generation Kill" [...] toting around a futuristic-looking ray gun and a retro-looking mind-reading machine, Walter casually injecting whatsername with a sedative—that I think I'll be sticking around for a bit... If I can brace myself for the probability that this will all lead to nonsense, I can groove on all the <b>atmospherics</b> along the way. And, if nothing else, Abrams is great at atmosphere." ...|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang of Variety {{said the}} film was [...] "a wham-bam sequel noticeably lacking in the pop gravitas, moody <b>atmospherics,</b> and {{emotional}} weight that made the first two Marvel comicbook adaptations so rousingly successful." [...] Frank Lovece of Film Journal International said, [...] "A risk-taking script with genuine consequences elevates this above the lackluster direction of Brett Ratner, whose competent mechanics move the story efficiently but with very little soul." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] ""diminished sequel, a brute-force enterprise" [...] {{and said it was}} an example of [...] "what happens when movies are confused with sandwich shops as franchise opportunities". The Minneapolis Star Tribune characterized Ratner's approach as [...] "Forget subtlety! Let's blow things up!" [...] David Edelstein of New York magazine called it [...] "just another big-budget B-movie. It's a fast and enjoyable B-movie, though." [...] Foreshadowing , Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said, [...] "Last stand? My ass. Billed as the climax of a trilogy, the third and weakest chapter in the X-Men series is a blatant attempt to prove there is still life in the franchise. And there is: just enough to pull a Star Trek and spawn a Next Generation saga." ...|$|E
500|$|Carolyn Menyes of the Music Times named [...] "West Coast" [...] {{as one of}} her {{favorite}} Del Rey songs to-date, highlighting Auerbach's influence as what benefited it most. In her review, she went on to opine, [...] "Her voice plays off it well, too, and she actually feels passionate on this song, as opposed to her typical bored thing". While Caitlyn Carter, Joey DeGroot and Kyle Dowling of the same publication named it a stand-out on Ultraviolence. Kate Hutchinson of The Guardian called it [...] "one of the finest pop songs of the last five years". While Kitty Empire of the same publication wrote, [...] "The engaging West Coast improves on every hearing, a clever two-in-one track rich with detail, rhythm, <b>atmospherics</b> and class". Drowned in Sound's Robert Leedham said that with [...] "West Coast", Del Rey developed a song to [...] "trump" [...] "Video Games" [...] (2011), and a [...] "new found guttural swagger". Leedham also commended Del Rey's key changes, [...] "masterful" [...] sway from tension, and reverberation in the song. Scott T. Sterling of the CBS Corporation opined that the track expanded the dimensions of Del Rey's sound, and that it was [...] "one of the most distinctive hits of 2014". The Boston Globe writer James Reed commented, [...] "'West Coast' has a noirish sensuality, which opens into a chorus that mimicks the heady rush of a first toke".|$|E
500|$|Upon release, {{the album}} was well {{received}} by reviewers. Sounds gave Join Hands a grade of 4.5 out of 5, with the reviewer, Pete Silverton, noting {{a change in the}} sound: [...] "The mix is different to the last album. Now there's a clarity which frames Sue's voice like it was a thing of treasure". Silverton also wrote that some of the songs have [...] "Siouxsie's voice double-tracked with devastating effect". Jon Savage, a Melody Maker reviewer, described the first track, [...] "Poppy Day", as a [...] "short, powerful evocation of the Great War graveyards in Flanders". He also wrote that [...] "Placebo Effect" [...] "has a stunning flanged guitar intro, chasing clinical lyrics covering some insertion or operation". About [...] "Icon", Savage wrote: [...] "The brilliantly reverbed guitar is a perfect foil for Siouxsie's soaring and, for once, emotional vocal." [...] Savage noted that the five songs of the first side [...] "rise and fall into another in a stunning segue". Similarly, Paul Morley [...] wrote in NME that [...] "Side one's five songs [...] are all addictive Banshees mini-dramas". Ronnie Gurr, a Record Mirror reviewer, also hailed the record, saying: [...] "Poppy Day establishes the band's perfect employ of <b>atmospherics</b> and sets the tone of all the tracks". [...] "Mother" [...] was compared to the soundtrack of an Alfred Hitchcock film, with Gurr noting that the [...] "track features a musical box, echoes menacing guitar grumblings and Siouxsie providing vocals that would befit any of Hitchcock's best matricides". Gurr concluded that with [...] "Severin's truly disturbing scratchings", Join Hands was a dangerous work that [...] "should be heard".|$|E
500|$|Keenan {{rejoined the}} {{sessions}} in early 2003, {{and the music}} began taking a different direction with the new lineup and Keenan's influence. Beyond the new personnel, the dynamic had changed: With Mer de Noms, Howerdel had already written and finalized all of the music, with Keenan just contributing the lyrics and vocals. This time around, Keenan was more active in vetoing or altering musical ideas, determined to make something different than just another hard rock album, in fear of it being redundant. Sessions became tense, with Howerdel preferring the heavier compositions written while waiting for Keenan {{to return to the}} band, and sometimes taking offense to Keenan's suggested mellower rearrangements. White would play the role of a mediator between the two; being newer to the band helped him provide an outsider's perspective, helping them to find a common ground. The band released their second album, Thirteenth Step, on September 16, 2003. The album debuted even higher than Mer de Noms, charting at number 2 in its opening week and selling over 233,000 copies. [...] The album, and its accompanying new sound, fared well critically as well. The AllMusic review praised the bands new sound, describing it as [...] "moodier, tenser, and more atmospheric (if that is possible) recording than its predecessor...The wide dynamic swathes that were so prominent on the band's debut are all but absent here. The squalling guitars have taken a backseat to carefully crafted melodies where <b>atmospherics</b> are maximized and pulled taut over the listener. While not a radical departure from Mer de Noms, there is a real progression here.... Lyrically, musically, sonically, the Thirteenth Step is proof positive that mainstream rock has plenty of life and vision left in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The city of New Orleans and its <b>atmospherics</b> {{function}} as a protagonist in the film. This {{is evident from the}} beginning of the film: The opening is an aerial shot of the New Orleans bayou and the cajun band BeauSoleil plays [...] "Zydeco Gris Gris" [...] on the soundtrack (title sequence).|$|E
2500|$|The Guardian also {{praised the}} band {{for the balance}} struck on Honor Found in Decay: [...] "In less skilful hands, this {{relentless}} sonic oppression would be gruelling, but by expressing human frailty with such visceral abandon, Neurosis have once again turned darkness into euphoria." [...] Similarly, Popmatters observed an equilibrium between [...] "emotional complexity" [...] and being [...] "resoundingly heavy, with unguarded truth being {{just as important as}} thick <b>atmospherics</b> or colossal riffs." ...|$|E
2500|$|As far as Led Zeppelin's studio {{recordings}} went, {{every single}} one of them has a certain ambiance, certain <b>atmospherics</b> that made them special. When it came to the live shows, we were always trying to move things forward and we certainly weren't happy leaving them as they were. The songs were always in a state of change. On [...] Song Remains the Same you can hear the urgency and not much else. The live shows were an extension of the albums.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story of}} two brothers—one a law {{enforcement}} officer, the other a criminal—the film was a financial blockbuster. A Better Tomorrow became a defining achievement in Hong Kong action cinema for its combination of emotional drama, slow-motion gunplay, and gritty <b>atmospherics.</b> Its signature visual device of two-handed, two-gunned shootouts within confined quarters—often referred to as [...] "gun fu" [...] was novel, and its diametrical inversion of the [...] "good-guys-bad guys" [...] formula in its characterization would influence later American films.|$|E
2500|$|Trip hop tracks often {{incorporate}} Rhodes pianos, saxophones, trumpets, and flutes, and may employ unconventional instruments {{such as the}} theremin and Mellotron. Trip hop {{differs from}} hip hop in theme and overall tone. Instead of gangsta rap with its hard-hitting lyrics, trip hop offers a more aural <b>atmospherics</b> with instrumental hip hop, turntable scratching, and breakbeat rhythms. Regarded in some ways as a 1990s update of fusion, trip hop {{may be said to}} [...] "transcend" [...] the hardcore rap styles and lyrics with atmospheric overtones to create a more mellow tempo.|$|E
2500|$|Time {{reviewer}} Josh Tyrangiel praised guitarist Buck's [...] "resurgence" [...] and [...] "propulsive riffs," [...] {{but also}} wrote, [...] "R.E.M.'s 14th album never quite generates the moody <b>atmospherics</b> {{of their first}} 10; it's {{a little hard to}} lose yourself in something that doesn't pause long enough for you to get lost." [...] Uncut gave the album three out of five stars. Reviewer John Mulvey stated, [...] "Accelerate is a simple, pragmatic record built on an uncomfortable truth: sometimes, even the best bands have to retrace their steps, if only to remind themselves what they're really good at." ...|$|E
