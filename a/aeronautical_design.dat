Personnel of Project Sign, the first U.S. Air Force UFO investigation group, noted that the advanced flying wing <b>aeronautical</b> <b>designs</b> of the German Horten brothers were similar to some UFO reports. In 1959, Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, the first head of Project Blue Book (Project Sign's follow-up investigation) wrote: When WWII ended, the Germans had several radical types of aircraft and guided missiles under development. The majority were in the most preliminary stages, but they were the only known craft that could even approach the performance of objects reported by UFO observers.|$|R
