5|$|Blackpool {{qualified}} for the final again in 1972, but were unsuccessful in their defence of the title, with Roma winning 3–1. In 1973, points were no longer awarded for each goal scored, and Newcastle United {{went on to win}} the final 2–1 against Fiorentina at the Stadio Artemio Franchi on 3 June 1973. Due to lack of interest the tournament did not continue, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> until 1976 that it re-emerged as a semi-professional competition.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes drum, {{although}} the male does {{so much more}} often, mostly from mid-January until the young are fledged. The far-carrying drumming is faster than for any other woodpecker in its range at around 10–16strikes per second, typically in one-second bursts, although repeated frequently. As late as {{the early twentieth century}} it was thought that the drumming might be a vocalisation, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> until 1943 that it was finally proved to be purely mechanical.|$|E

5|$|De Candolle, in {{the first}} {{systematic}} taxonomy of Narcissus, arranged the species into named groups, and those names have largely endured for the various subdivisions since and bear his name as their authority.

5|$|In the 1570s, {{a survey}} {{recommended}} that four brass artillery guns be kept at the castle. The range of artillery guns soon increased, however, making it unnecessary to have armed forts {{on both sides}} of the river and, by the end of the 16th century, the castle's military utility had lessened <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> normally manned.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, {{small amounts}} of {{rutherfordium}} were produced in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in the former Soviet Union and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 8th century, the {{dominant}} Anglo-Saxon ruler was King Æthelbald of Mercia, who by 731 had become the overlord of all the provinces south of the River Humber.

5|$|Newman had a mixed {{record with}} French-language films.

5|$|Promotional {{recordings}} of the song were released in the United States and Mexico, and the song appeared on two record charts shortly after its release in 1993.

5|$|Substitutes, {{such as the}} wheat-based rice substitute, ptitim, were introduced, and {{versatile}} vegetables such as eggplant were used as alternatives to meat.

5|$|The Great Salt Lake entered written European history {{through the}} records of Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, who learned of its {{existence}} from the Timpanogos Utes in 1776.

In 1824, it was observed, apparently independently, by Jim Bridger and Etienne Provost. Shortly thereafter other trappers saw it and walked around it.|$|E
5|$|The Mystic Seaport Light {{is subject}} to United States Coast Guard {{regulations}} to become operational, {{and because it is}} a full-sized replica of a lighthouse, requirements include supervisory schedules and installation of an emergency, backup light.

5|$|The early {{development}} of cultigen taxonomy follows that of plant taxonomy in general {{as the early}} listing and documentation of plants made little distinction between those that were anthropogenic and those that were natural wild kinds.

5|$|The {{relative}} {{scarcity of}} hyena depictions in Paleolithic rock art has been theorised {{to be due}} to the animal's lower rank in the animal worship hierarchy; the spotted hyena's appearance was likely unappealing to Ice Age hunters, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> sought after as prey.
