40|$|Autism {{is one of}} {{disorders}} {{from the}} autism spectrum, besides Asperger syndrome, <b>atypical</b> autism and <b>pervasive</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disorder</b> not otherwise specified. They are classified as mental disorders as being manifested by {{a wide range of}} cognitive, emotional and neurobehavioural abnormalities. Key categorical characteristics of the disorder are clear impairments of the development of the child’s socialisation, understanding and production of verbal and non-verbal communication and restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviour. Demarcation boundaries are not clear, neither within the very group of the disorders from the autistic spectrum, nor with respect to the autistic behavioural features in the general population. For this reason, the term spectrum points out the significance of the dimensional assessment of autistic disorders, which will most likely be the basis of the new diagnostic classification of the disorders belonging to the current group of <b>pervasive</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disorders</b> in the new DSM-V classification. The understanding, as well as the prevalence of the autistic spectrum disorders has changed drastically in the last four decades. From the previous 4 per 10, 000 people, today’s prevalence estimates range from 0. 6 to around 1 %, and the increase of prevalence cannot be explained solely by better recognition on the part of experts and parents or by wider diagnostic criteria. The general conclusion is that the autistic spectrum disorders are no longer rare conditions and that the approach aimed at acknowledging the warning that this is an urgent public health problem is completely justified...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE. This study {{investigated}} the interrelationship between psychopharmacotherapy {{in general and the}} use of specific psychotropic drugs and <b>pervasive</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disorder</b> and other behavior problems in children and adolescents with mental retardation. METHODS. A total of 862 participants 4 to 18 years of age, including all levels of mental retardation, were recruited through facilities for children with mental retardation in Friesland, the Netherlands. Information on medication was collected through parent interviews. Behavior problems were investigated with a standardized parent questionnaire (Developmental Behavior Checklist). A <b>pervasive</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disorder</b> classification was based on the <b>Pervasive</b> <b>Developmental</b> <b>Disorder</b> in Mental Retardation Scale, completed by psychologists or teachers. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between the use of psychotropic drugs and <b>pervasive</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disorder</b> and other behavioral problems, in the presence of possible confounders. RESULTS. One of 10 participants used psychotropic medication. The main factors associated with psychotropic drug use were <b>pervasive</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disorder</b> and disruptive behavior. The level of functioning was also associated. Self-absorbed behavior was statistically significantly associated with clonidine use and disruptive behavior with stimulant use. <b>Pervasive</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disorder</b> and communication problems were the main factors {{associated with the use of}} antipsychotic drugs. Age also played a role, whereas gender, living situation, and level of mental retardation did not. CONCLUSIONS. Antipsychotic drugs were associated with <b>pervasive</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disorder,</b> whereas clonidine and stimulants were associated with self-absorbed and disruptive behavior, respectively. Although clonidine and risperidone are not registered for the problems reported and the other nonstimulants were only sometimes used on-label, their use was associated with specific psychiatric or behavioral problem...|$|R

40|$|Background: The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a comprehensive, empirical model that will allow the reorganization of the structure of the <b>pervasive</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disorder</b> symptom phenotype through factor analysis into more homogeneous dimensions. Method: The sample consisted of 209 children with <b>pervasive</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disorder</b> referred for genetic studies. The 12 subdomains of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised were used in a factor analysis, and the emerged factors were then correlated with independent variables (measures of cognition, adaptive function, and diagnostic subtype). Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate any familial relationships between sibling pairs on the derived factors. Results: The autism symptom phenotype is indeed made up of three factors or domains that are somewhat different than those used inDSM-IV. Rather, domains include social-communication, inflexible language and behavior, and repetitive sensory and motor behavior. For the three factors, only a small amount of variance was accounted for by cognitive and adaptive functioning. Only inflexible language and behavior showed familial correlation between siblings. Conclusions: The <b>pervasive</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disorder</b> symptom phenotype is composed of three domains or factors: social-communication, inflexible language and behavior, and repetitive sensory and motor behavior. Each child with <b>pervasive</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disorder</b> can be characterized by these dimensions, which give an informative picture of the clinical presentation and a quantitative estimate of the severity of the disability.
