More <b>automatisms</b> were produced during single word and nonword reading and repetition and picture description than during connected reading and counting, suggesting that internally generated (picture description) and externally triggered (single word and nonword reading and repetition) were equally affected. In addition, a complex speech task (connected reading) produced then fewest <b>automatisms</b> than easier ones (single words). However, tasks where there were increased opportunities for disinhibition produced more <b>automatisms.</b> Results do not suggest that the intrinsic or extrinsic motor speech systems are separately damaged, but do suggest that increased opportunities for disinhibition may produce more <b>automatisms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Some {{studies suggest}} that the pattern of glucose {{hypometabolism}} relates not only to the ictal-onset zone, but also reflects seizure propagation. We investigated metabolic changes in patients with occipital lobe epilepsy (OLE) that may reflect propagation of ictal discharge during seizures with <b>automatisms.</b> Methods: Fifteen patients who had undergone epilepsy surgery for intractable OLE and had undergone interictal Fluorine- 18 -fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18 F-FDG-PET) between 1994 and 2004 were divided into two groups (with and without <b>automatisms</b> during seizure). Significant regions of hypometabolism were identified by comparing 18 F-FDG-PET results from each group with 16 healthy controls by using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 2). Key Findings: Significant hypometabolism was confined largely to the epileptogenic occipital lobe in the patient group without <b>automatisms.</b> In patients with <b>automatisms,</b> glucose hypometabolism extended from the epileptogenic occipital lobe into the ipsilateral temporal lobe. Significance: We identified a distinctive hypometabolic pattern that was specific for OLE patients with <b>automatisms</b> during a seizure. This finding supports the postulate that seizure propagation is a cause of glucose hypometabolism beyond the region of seizure onset...|$|R

40|$|SummaryGenital {{and sexual}} manifestations {{represent}} rare clinical phenomena {{during or after}} focal seizures. The semiology {{of these types of}} <b>automatisms</b> is controversial. In particular, it is unclear whether temporal or frontal structures are involved in their generation and whether these clinical manifestations have a potential lateralizing value. In this view, from a population of 212 consecutive patients with drug resistant focal epilepsy referred to us for presurgical assessment, we retrospectively identified 24 patients with genital ictal manifestations. We evaluated the incidence of these behaviours, the clinical semiology, the associated symptoms/signs with the corresponding ictal EEG findings and their potential role in lateralizing the epileptogenic zone. Our results indicate that ictal genital <b>automatisms</b> are possible in seizures originating from temporal lobe and they cannot be attributed exclusively to frontal lobe seizures.

25|$|On either argument, the {{defendant}} {{would have been}} entitled to an acquittal; however, the court considered it doubtful whether Bailey had laid sufficient basis for his defence to be considered by the jury at all.

25|$|In 1924, Miró {{joined the}} Surrealist group. The already {{symbolic}} and poetic nature of Miró’s work, {{as well as}} the dualities and contradictions inherent to it, fit well within the context of dream-like <b>automatism</b> espoused by the group. Much of Miró’s work lost the cluttered chaotic lack of focus that had defined his work thus far, and he experimented with collage and the process of painting within his work so as to reject the framing that traditional painting provided. This antagonistic attitude towards painting manifested itself when Miró referred to his work in 1924 ambiguously as “x” in a letter to poet friend Michel Leiris. The paintings that came out of this period were eventually dubbed Miró’s dream paintings.|$|E
25|$|Bailey claimed at {{his trial}} {{that he had no}} memory of the attack and had been acting in a state of <b>automatism</b> caused by {{hypoglycaemia}} as he had not eaten since his last insulin dose. His general practitioner gave evidence that this might cause aggressive behaviour and loss of memory but was unlikely to have caused the sudden loss of awareness claimed by the defendant. The prosecution's case was that although theoretically possible, this was not what had happened. They argued that Bailey had armed himself with the iron bar and gone to the boyfriend's house with the intention of harming him. Evidence was given that shortly after the attack he had been interviewed by the police and seemed to behave quite normally.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe 25 -year-old {{right-handed}} woman {{suffering from}} temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) {{was referred to}} our centre for presurgical evaluation. MRI showed a right-sided hippocampal sclerosis. During video-EEG-recorded seizures, abdominal aura was followed by oral <b>automatisms,</b> during which she was completely reactive to external stimuli, although {{she was unable to}} speak. Ictal EEG showed right temporal seizure pattern, without contralateral propagation. She had abnormal speech postictally. Speech-activated functional transcranial Doppler sonography revealed right-sided speech dominance. She has become seizure free after a right-sided amygdalo-hippocampectomy. In our patient, contradictory clinical ictal lateralising signs (<b>automatisms</b> with preserved responsiveness vs. ictal and postictal dysphasia) occurred during right-, speech-dominant-sided seizures. This is the first report when <b>automatisms</b> with preserved consciousness occurred during a seizure originating and involving the speech-dominant hemisphere...|$|R
25|$|Baciu {{made his}} {{editorial}} debut as a teenager, with German- and Romanian-language poems {{published in the}} local reviews Klingsor and Răboj. In September 1933, having been denied sponsorship of a literary magazine by Șaguna College, he set up his own, avant-garde sheet called Start. It was indebted to surrealist <b>automatism</b> and by André Gide's rebellious philosophy. Start functioned as a local satellite of I. Valerian's Viața Literară, which had appointed Baciu its official correspondent and publicity agent {{for the whole of}} Transylvania. Struggling with financial difficulties, Start did not survive beyond its second issue. Baciu moved on to publish other magazines, alongside Vintilă Horia, Mihai Beniuc, and Ovid Caledoniu: Stilet ("Stiletto"), then Meșterul Manole (named after the folk legend hero). Additionally, he was a contributor to literary magazines and newspapers across Romania, including Gând Românesc, Glasul Bucovinei, Rampa, and George Ivașcu's Manifest.|$|E
25|$|Freud {{initiated}} the psychoanalytic critique of Surrealism with his remark that what interested him {{most about the}} Surrealists was not their unconscious but their conscious. His meaning was that the manifestations of and experiments with psychic <b>automatism</b> highlighted by Surrealists as the liberation of the unconscious were highly structured by ego activity, similar to {{the activities of the}} dream censorship in dreams, and that therefore it was in principle a mistake to regard Surrealist poems and other art works as direct manifestations of the unconscious, when they were indeed highly shaped and processed by the ego. In this view, the Surrealists may have been producing great works, but they were products of the conscious, not the unconscious mind, and they deceived themselves with regard to what they were doing with the unconscious. In psychoanalysis proper, the unconscious does not just express itself automatically but can only be uncovered through the analysis of resistance and transference in the psychoanalytic process.|$|E
25|$|Sanity is a rebuttable {{presumption}} and {{the burden of}} proof is on the party denying it; the standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities, that is to say that mental incapacity is more likely than not. If this burden is successfully discharged, the party relying upon it is entitled to succeed. In Lord Denning's judgement in Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland 1963 AC 386, whenever the defendant makes an issue of his state of mind, the prosecution can adduce evidence of insanity. However, this will normally only arise to negate the defence case when <b>automatism</b> or diminished responsibility is in issue. In practical terms, the defence {{will be more likely to}} raise the issue of mental incapacity to negate or minimise criminal liability. In R v Clarke 1972 1 All E R 219 a defendant charged with a shoplifting claimed she had no mens rea because she had absent-mindedly walked out of the shop without paying because she suffered from depression. When the prosecution attempted to adduce evidence that this constituted insanity within the Rules, she changed her plea to guilty, but on appeal the Court ruled that she had been merely denying mens rea rather than raising a defence under the Rules and her conviction was quashed. The general rule was stated that the Rules apply only to cases in which the defect of reason is substantial.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} certain psychic <b>automatisms</b> {{that are usually}} {{diagnosed}} as psychiatric symptoms or as simple partial seizures. These mental <b>automatisms</b> are described in many writ-ings by mystics, philosophers, literates, composers, and many different great artists and creators from human history, but they have never conferred any pathological value on these experiences. We have carried out previous scientific researches in which we found abundant arguments sug-gesting that these <b>automatisms</b> are due to neuronal nets physiologically adapted to fire in a hypersynchronous way. With these pieces of information we propose an audacious hypothesis: these automatic experiences are manifestations of a cognitive cerebral function that, until now, has been insufficiently delimited. We propose the term hyperia to denominate this cognitive func-tion, which we consider responsible for clairvoyant and/or telepathic cognitions. Finally, we dis-cuss the relevant consequences of this hypothesis, particularly {{in the fields of}} epilepsy, psychiatry, and neuropsychopharmacology...|$|R
500|$|The bands Clock DVA, Nocturnal Emissions, Whitehouse, Nurse with Wound, and SPK soon followed. Whitehouse {{intended}} to play [...] "the most brutal and extreme music of all time", a style they eventually called power electronics. An early collaborator with Whitehouse, Steve Stapleton, formed Nurse with Wound, who experimented with noise sculpture and sound collage. Clock DVA described their goal as borrowing equally from surrealist <b>automatism</b> and [...] "nervous energy sort of funk stuff, body music that flinches you {{and makes you}} move." [...] 23 Skidoo, like Clock DVA, merged industrial music with African-American dance music, but also performed a response to world music. Performing at the first WOMAD Festival in 1982, the group likened themselves to Indonesian gamelan.

500|$|With time, Tristan Tzara merged his {{performances}} and his literature, {{taking part in}} developing Dada's [...] "simultaneist poetry", which {{was meant to be}} read out loud and involved a collaborative effort, being, according to Hans Arp, the first instance of Surrealist <b>automatism.</b> Ball stated that the subject of such pieces was [...] "the value of the human voice." [...] Together with Arp, Tzara and Walter Serner produced the German-language Die Hyperbel vom Krokodilcoiffeur und dem Spazierstock ("The Hyperbole of the Crocodile's Hairdresser and the Walking-Stick"), in which, Arp stated, [...] "the poet crows, curses, sighs, stutters, yodels, as he pleases. His poems are like Nature [...] a tiny particle is as beautiful and important as a star."

500|$|Where the {{defendant}} {{is alleged to have}} been insane at the time of committing the offence, this issue can be raised in one of three ways; {{the defendant}} can claim he was insane, the defendant can raise a defence of <b>Automatism</b> where the judge decides it was instead insanity, or the defendant can raise a plea of diminished responsibility, where the judge or prosecution again show that insanity is more appropriate. Whatever the way in which a plea of insanity is reached, the same test is used each time, as laid out in the M'Naghten Rules; [...] "to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of the}} committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong".|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{episodes of}} {{aggressive}} or violent behaviour may occur {{during or after}} an epileptic fit. Epileptic <b>automatisms</b> are regarded by the law as `insane automatisms'.

500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dehors theory is based on detective drafting of the Wills Act. In particular, whilst the term [...] "will" [...] is commonly used to refer to a specific document, the WIlls Act is designed to cover almost all documents except rules on public trust and secret trust that are to take effect after the testator's death. Indeed, the formality requirements of the Wills Act created the need for a set of prima facie documents, like the one commonly referred to. Therefore, to refer to an arrangement as dehor the Wills Act because it is not a prima facie reference to the document is incorrect. The response has been to view the secret trust as a disposition inter vivos ("between the living") rather than testamentary under exception. Although the testator is unlikely to consider the trust having come into existence {{at the time of the}} will upon his death, whether a disposition is arguably though less convincingly regarded as an inter vivos is a question for the courts as well as parliament. However, other types of inter vivos trust are incapable of binding after-acquired property or operating so as to, whether automatically, semi-automatically or no <b>automatism</b> at all, bind such property as and when it is received. No separate declaration of trust is required in the case of property acquired after the execution of a will for it to form part of a secret trust. Looking at the definition of a [...] "testamentary disposition" [...] and [...] "inter vivo trust" [...] as applied in other sorts of cases is inconclusive.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} R. v. Stone (1999), {{the issue of}} crime {{committed}} by a person suffering from <b>automatism</b> was considered.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: To {{determine}} the lateralising value of leg behaviors in complex partial seizures (CPS) of temporal lobe onset. Methods: Videotapes of 123 seizures from 38 {{patients who were}} seizure-free after temporal lobectomy were reviewed. Ictal behaviors including head turning, limb <b>automatisms,</b> tonic/dystonic postures and the latent time for ictal behavior were analysed for their lateralising value. Results: Contralateral versive head turning, ipsilateral arm <b>automatisms,</b> contralateral arm tonic/dystonic posturing, and contralateral arm clonic posturing {{were found to have}} high predictive value of lateralisation. As for the lower limbs, meaningful leg behaviors were recorded in 38 (31 %) of 123 seizures, far less than behaviors of the upper limbs (79 %). The predictive value from leg behaviors were similar to that from upper limbs. Among the leg behaviors, dystonic behaviors were always contralateral to the ictal side. Tonic behaviors were 94 % contralateral to the ictal side. Dystonia and clonic movement were always contralateral to the ictal side. <b>Automatisms</b> were 86 % ipsilateral to the ictal side. Conclusions: Although incidences were low, leg behaviors could provide useful lateralising value of the seizure foci. Clinicians as well as investigators should recognize the value of lower limbs behavior in studies of ictal semiology...|$|R
