5000|$|Sexual assault victims {{experience}} stigmatization {{based on}} <b>rape</b> myths.

Victims in these cultures may suffer isolation, physical and psychological abuse, slut-shaming, public humiliation rituals, be disowned by friends and family, be prohibited from marrying, be divorced if already married, or even be killed. However, even in many developed countries, including some sectors of United States society, misogyny remains culturally ingrained.|$|R
25|$|Not every suicide {{case was}} successful. Some mothers who had drowned their {{children}} were unable to drown themselves thereafter. In other cases, doses of poison proved to be lethal for children, but not for their mothers. There were also cases where children survived attempted drownings. After a failed suicide, some killed themselves by others methods. A mother and her repeatedly raped daughter, for instance, died by hanging themselves in an attic, after repeatedly failing to drown themselves in the Peene river. Another mother who had poisoned and buried three of her four children before, tried to hang herself on an oak three times, only to be prevented to do so each time by Soviet soldiers. There are further records of Soviet soldiers preventing suicides by retrieving people from the river and nursing cut wrists. In another case, a grandfather forcibly took away a razor blade from a mother {{who was about to}} kill her children and herself after being raped by Soviet soldiers and hearing of the death of her husband. After Soviet soldiers had raped a girl to death and shot her father, an aunt cut her daughter's and son's wrists as well as her own. The other women of the family committed suicide, only one aunt was able to save the grandmother. One family survived, because the 15-year-old son persuaded his mother, who had become <b>a</b> <b>rape</b> <b>victim,</b> to abort her induced drowning, when she was already being dragged by the Tollense river.|$|E

Research has shown that <b>a</b> <b>rape</b> <b>victim’s</b> emotional expression can affect how she is perceived by jurors, and rape myth acceptance is influential in juror’s decision making. This study sought to establish if victim’s emotional expression and participant <b>rape</b> <b>victim</b> empathy, affected mock juror’s assessments of <b>a</b> <b>rape</b> <b>victim’s</b> credibility. 80 participants watched one of four video set-ups where the victim’s emotional expression was varied across her initial police interview and her courtroom testimony in a factorial design. Her emotional expression was portrayed as either calm or upset. Participants also filled in the Rape Empathy Scale (RES) {{and were asked to}} pass a judgement of guilt on the perpetrator. Significant changes in mock juror belief of the victim’s story were found from the police video to the court video, showing that participants believed her story more after both videos regardless of the victim’s emotional expression. RES scores were significantly associated with story belief across both videos and higher <b>rape</b> <b>victim</b> empathy was correlated with higher victim story belief. The influence of rape empathy on mock juror belief that the allegation was false approached significance. <b>Rape</b> <b>victim</b> empathy also showed a significant gender difference with women scoring higher in empathy than men.

Yet by his own admission he did not have verbal affirmation; and even if she never said “no,” silence certainly does not equal “yes.” Although it’s often difficult to read and understand body language, the fact that some individuals interpret the absence of a “no” as a “yes” is problematic at least, criminal at worst."
