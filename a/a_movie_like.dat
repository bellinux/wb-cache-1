[...] Stephanie Ochona reviewed for Renowned for Sound and gave the soundtrack 4.5 out of 5 ratings, she said, [...] "Set in the 80s where drugs and other experimentation was all the rage, music plays a big factor in the entire atmosphere of the movie.

[...] Ochona also said that, [...] "Without such an accurate soundtrack, the film wouldn't have made such a big impact, and both the visual and aural aspects work together to create a beautiful story of a man fighting for the right to live his life." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1963 Donen {{made one}} of his most praised films: Charade, {{starring}} Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass. Donen has said that he had [...] "always wanted to make <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>like</b> one of my favorites, Hitchcock's North by Northwest" [...] and the film has been referred to as [...] "the best Hitchcock movie that Hitchcock never made." [...] Charade was produced by Stanley Donen Productions, released through Universal and adapted by Peter Stone from his own novel. Reggie Lampert (Hepburn) discovers that her husband has been murdered and (at least) three sinister men are all searching for the $250,000 in gold that he had hidden somewhere. Peter Joshua (Grant) befriends Reggie and helps her fight off the three thugs while the two begin to fall in love, and in the end no one is quite who they seem to be. The film was released in December 1963, only two weeks after the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy, and the word [...] "assassinate" [...] had to be redubbed twice. It was Donen's most financially successful film and influenced a number of romantic comedy-thrillers released in the years following it. Film critic Judith Crist called it a [...] "stylish and amusing melodrama", and Pauline Kael said it had [...] "a freshness and spirit that makes [...] unlike the films of any other country" [...] and was [...] "probably the best American film of [...] ". In 2002 it was remade as The Truth About Charlie, directed by Jonathan Demme.|$|E

Thomas {{explained}} {{that he had been}} very busy writing for Cupid and Party Down, both of which he created. In January 2009, TV Guide reported that the film was Thomas' first priority after Cupid. Thomas noted that as well as writing the script, someone would need to pay for the film, but indicated that producer Joel Silver was ready to green-light the film. In June 2009, Bell said [...] "I don't think it will ever happen, and here's why: [...] Rob Thomas and I had a powwow, and we were both 100 percent on board. We took our proposal to Warner Bros. and Joel Silver told us that there is no enthusiasm [...] to make a Veronica Mars movie, and that is unfortunately a roadblock we cannot compete with." [...] At the 2010 TCA Winter Press Tour, Rob Thomas stated that the movie wouldn't be happening, [...] "I would write it if anyone would finance it. If anyone's interested in making that movie I am available, Kristen's [...] available. I would love to do it. I think the closest we came was Joel [...] pushing it at Warner Bros. and they didn't bite. It has sort of gone away." [...] In April 2010, Thomas insisted, [...] "it's not dead. I continue to want to do it [...] We're still looking into it." [...] In June 2010, Silver was less optimistic about the film happening; [...] "we analyzed all these areas about it. I talked to the home video people, because <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>like</b> that would be driven by video. The [...] didn't do that well... So they didn't feel there was a need or an audience." ...|$|E

[...] "When you're trying to make <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>like</b> this, it's very rare that it reaches a wide audience." [...] HBO was equally intrigued by the story, and Gerson Saines credits past and present HBO executives with keeping the project alive until it could be properly realized.

2500|$|The {{film was}} well received. On Rotten Tomatoes, {{the film has}} an 87% 'Fresh' rating based on 54 reviews with an average rating of 7.3/10.

Roger Ebert gave the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four, writing: [...] "Pi is a thriller. I am not very thrilled these days by whether the bad guys will get shot or the chase scene will end one way instead of another. You have to make <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>like</b> that pretty skillfully before I care. But I am thrilled when a man risks his mind in the pursuit of a dangerous obsession." [...] James Berardinelli gave the film three out of four stars, writing: [...] " [...] transports us to a world that is like yet unlike our own, and, in its mysterious familiarity, is eerie, intense, and compelling. Reality is a fragile commodity, but, because the script is well-written and the central character is strongly developed, it's not hard to suspend disbelief....It probably deserves 3.1416 stars, but since my scale doesn't support that, I'll round it off to three." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lighting {{challenges}} were abound for Greenberg {{as most of}} {{the film}} took place at night. One of the simplest techniques for lighting employed by Greenberg was using a car's headlights to dramatically produce a scene of terror. Greenberg explained, [...] "We had a scene on Zuma Beach where the bad guys are dragging somebody into the ocean. I wanted to have a very hard, but very natural, and strong look. So, I used the car headlights. It was nice because everything behind the villains fell into darkness. It had a surrealistic look." [...] Greenberg also remarked how he had a close working relationship with DeLuxe lab in getting the correct color for the extensive night shooting in the film by bluntly saying, [...] "In <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>like</b> this I wanted the blacks to be very black, so I worked closely with DeLuxe lab ..." [...] He felt the daily challenges of night shooting visibly enhanced the appeal of Alien Nation by figuratively mentioning, [...] "as a cameraman, you can create a lot more at night. Sometimes you have to feel your way. You also have true control at night. If a light is on it is because you turned it on." ...|$|E

[...] He said of Hilton's performance that [...] "she is no better or worse than the typical Dead Post-Teenager and does exactly what she is required to do in <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>like</b> this, with all the skill—admittedly finite—that is required." [...] Film critic Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post called it a [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] and wrote that it gives horror fans exactly what they want. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, [...] "After a month, no one will talk about this movie again. Still, with a picture like this, there is really only one question: Is it fun? Yes. Lots. Definitely." [...] Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle called it boring and poorly-acted, though he complimented Cuthbert and Murray. [...] A. O.

2500|$|Bates said {{on using}} themes and motifs in the score, [...] "Very few {{movies that are}} made these days are fantastical enough to sustain huge, bold {{identifiable}} themes. Even {{with the majority of}} the comic-book films, they have a tendency to be steeped in a realism that would be disturbed or interrupted by highly emotive, melodic themes, and it seems like {{a lot of the stuff}} going in these films is propulsive and somewhat cold emotionally." [...] He felt that Guardians of the Galaxy did not fit this model, and [...] "unabashedly embraced leitmotifs for the array of cosmic characters" [...] that appear in it. Bates described creating a new main theme for a Marvel franchise as [...] "the most rewarding aspect of stepping into <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>like</b> this". Gunn asked for [...] "something kickass that a 4-year-old would remember", and Bates came up with the theme by [...] "noodling" [...] on an electric guitar. The villain Ronan's theme is quoted in full only once in the film, as Bates and Gunn wanted him to be more serious and scary which they felt would be undermined by a loud, melodic theme. His presence is generally represented with tones [...] "chock full of low-brass" [...] and synths. Bates has [...] "some spongy synthesizers pulsing through" [...] the motif for Groot, which he developed in pre-production. Bates said that he would have infused the score with more of those electronic elements if it was not for the [...] "frenetic working process" [...] on the film.|$|E

She said that [...] "Murder" [...] "isn't serious, {{based on a true story}} or a threat.... It's a metaphor about a girl who can get away with murder because of who she is" [...] and said that [...] "Rule Breaker" [...] was an attempt to [...] "capture that badass feeling you get sometimes after watching <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> <b>like</b> True Romance. You think you can take on the world and you want to color outside the lines and get a tattoo or mouth off to someone way bigger than you."

With that, when you go somewhere and girls give you the mean eye. You're like, 'oh, wow– this is crazy.' 'Hot Stuff' makes fun of that. That song is meant to be a good time."
