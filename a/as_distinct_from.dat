5|$|Hundreds of books, {{articles}} and websites now describe AS, and prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS {{recognized as an}} important subgroup. Whether it should be seen <b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> high-functioning autism is a fundamental issue requiring further study, and {{there are questions about}} the empirical validation of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. In 2013, DSM-5 eliminated AS as a separate diagnosis, folding it into the autism spectrum on a severity scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of psoriasis as an autoimmune disease has sparked considerable debate.

The commission took care not to propose anything which would equate co-habitation with marriage due to concerns that such a proposal might violate the constitutional protection of the family.|$|E

Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, <b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E

5|$|E. c. albipennis was {{described}} by John Gould in 1841 and found in north Queensland, west though the Gulf of Carpentaria in the Northern Territory and across {{into the top of}} Western Australia. It has white on the wings and a discontinuous stripe on the nape. The wing patch is pure white {{in the western part of}} its range and is more cream towards the east. It has a longer bill and shorter tail than the nominate race. Birds also decrease in size with decreasing latitude, consistent with Bergmann's rule. Molecular work supports the current classification of this subspecies <b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> the nominate subspecies cyanotis.|$|E
5|$|Hemorrhage from a Rathke's cleft cyst, {{a remnant}} of Rathke's pouch that {{normally}} regresses after embryological development, may cause symptoms that are indistinguishable from pituitary apoplexy. Pituitary apoplexy is regarded by some <b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> Sheehan's syndrome, where the pituitary undergoes infarction {{as a result of}} prolonged very low blood pressure, particularly when caused by bleeding after childbirth.

5|$|Increasing {{knowledge}} of plant anatomy, morphology and life cycles {{led to the}} realisation {{that there were more}} natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus. Adanson (1763), de Jussieu (1789), and Candolle (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed. The Candollean system reflected his ideas of the progression of morphological complexity and the later classification by Bentham and Hooker, which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach. Darwin's publication of the Origin of Species in 1859 and his concept of common descent required modifications to the Candollean system to reflect evolutionary relationships <b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> mere morphological similarity.|$|E

5|$|No. 77 Wing {{formed the}} attack {{component}} of No.10 Operational Group (No.10 OG), {{which was established}} on 13November 1943. The group was {{to act as a}} mobile strike force capable of supporting Allied ground and naval units while they advanced against the Japanese in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), <b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> the RAAF's area commands in Northern Australia, which had a geographically based static defence function. Led by Wing Commander E.G. Fyfe, No.77 Wing consisted of three flying squadrons operating Vultee Vengeance dive bombers, and various ancillary units. The Vengeances, which had only recently been acquired by Australia, equipped Nos. 21, 23 and 24 Squadrons. They were to be protected on their attack missions by No.10 OG's fighter component, No.78 Wing, operating Curtiss Kittyhawks.|$|E
5|$|The MSE {{derives from}} an {{approach}} to psychiatry known as descriptive psychopathology or descriptive phenomenology, which developed {{from the work of}} the philosopher and psychiatrist Karl Jaspers.

5|$|This bipedal ornithopod {{is known}} from several partial skeletons and skulls that {{indicate}} it grew to between 2.5 and 4.0meters (8.2 to 13.1ft) in length on average. It had sturdy hind limbs, small wide hands, {{and a head}} with an elongate pointed snout. The form of the teeth and jaws suggest a primarily herbivorous animal. This genus of dinosaur {{is regarded as a}} specialized basal ornithopod, traditionally described as a hypsilophodont, but more recently recognized <b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> Hypsilophodon. Several species have been suggested for this genus. Three currently are recognized as valid: the type species T. neglectus, T. garbanii and T. assiniboiensis.|$|E

Depending on regional market ubiquity, local spice variations may be labeled <b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> traditional Southern U.S. flavors, or may appear on menus without notation. With access to chickens suitable for frying broadening on a global scale with the advent of industrialized poultry farming, many localities have added their own mark on fried chicken, tweaking recipes to suit local preferences.|$|E
5|$|Galileo made {{a number}} of {{contributions}} to what is now known as engineering, <b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> pure physics. Between 1595 and 1598, Galileo devised and improved a Geometric and military compass suitable for use by gunners and surveyors. This expanded on earlier instruments designed by Niccolò Tartaglia and Guidobaldo del Monte. For gunners, it offered, in addition to a new and safer way of elevating cannons accurately, a way of quickly computing the charge of gunpowder for cannonballs of different sizes and materials. As a geometric instrument, it enabled the construction of any regular polygon, computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector, {{and a variety of other}} calculations. Under Galileo's direction, instrument maker Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni produced more than 100 of these compasses, which Galileo sold (along with an instruction manual he wrote) for 50 lire and offered a course of instruction in the use of the compasses for 120 lire.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{heraldry}} has {{a number}} of characteristics that distinguish the Swedish style from heraldry in other European countries. Common features of Swedish heraldry {{are similar to those of}} other Nordic countries and Germany, placing it in the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, distinguished from Gallo-British heraldry and other heraldic traditions by several key elements of heraldic style. One of these is the use of multiple helmets and crests, which cannot be displayed separately from the main shield. These helmets and crests are considered to be as important as the shield, each denoting a fief over which the bearer holds a right. In Scandinavia (<b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> the German custom), when an even number of helmets is displayed, they are usually turned, with their crests, to face outward; when an odd number, the center helmet is turned affronté and the rest turned outward (whereas in Germany the helmets are turned inward to face the center of the escutcheon). Additionally, the crests are often repetitive of charges used on the main shield, and marks of cadency typically occur in the crest, rather than on the shield as in Gallo-British heraldry. Also, the use of heraldic furs on the shield, while common in Gallo-British heraldry, is rare in German-Nordic heraldry. Furs in Scandinavia are generally limited to ermine and vair, which sometimes appear in mantling, supporters, or the trimmings of crowns, but rarely on the shield.|$|E

5|$|The {{first episode}} in the saga of German {{unification}} under Bismarck came with the Schleswig-Holstein Question. On 15 November 1863, King Christian IX of Denmark became king of Denmark and duke of Schleswig and Holstein. On 18 November 1863, he signed the Danish November Constitution and declared the Duchy of Schleswig a part of Denmark. The German Confederation saw this act {{as a violation of}} the London Protocol of 1852, which emphasized the status of the kingdom of Denmark <b>as</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> the independent duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. The populations of Schleswig and Holstein, furthermore, greatly valued this separate status. The German Confederation could use the ethnicities of these duchies as a rallying cry: large portions of both Schleswig and Holstein were of German origin and spoke German in everyday life (though Schleswig had a sizable Danish minority). Diplomatic attempts to have the November Constitution repealed collapsed, and fighting began when Prussian and Austrian troops crossed the border into Schleswig on 1 February 1864. Initially, the Danes attempted to defend their country using an ancient earthen wall known as the Danevirke, but this proved futile. The Danes were no match for the combined Prussian and Austrian forces, and they could not rely on help from their allies in the other Scandinavian states because Denmark had nullified its alliance rights by violating the London Protocol. The Needle Gun, one of the first bolt action rifles to be used in conflict, aided the Prussians in both this war and the Austro-Prussian War two years later. The rifle enabled a Prussian soldier to fire five shots while lying prone, while its muzzle-loading counterpart could only fire one shot and had to be reloaded while standing. The Second Schleswig War resulted in victory for the combined armies of Prussia and Austria, and the two countries won control of Schleswig and Holstein in the concluding peace of Vienna, signed on 30 October 1864.|$|E
