5000|$|The Bundeswehr {{maintained}} a [...] "glass ceiling" [...] policy that effectively banned homosexuals from becoming officers until 2000. First Lieutenant Winfried Stecher, an army officer demoted for his homosexuality, had {{filed a lawsuit}} against former Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping. Scharping vowed to fight the claim in court, claiming that homosexuality [...] "raises serious doubts about suitability and excludes employment in all functions pertaining to leadership." [...] However, before the case went to trial, the Defense Ministry reversed the policy. While the German government declined to issue an official explanation for the reversal, it is widely believed that Scharping was overruled by former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and former Vice-Chancellor Joschka Fischer. Nowadays, according to general military orders given in the year 2000, tolerance towards all sexual orientations is considered {{to be part of the}} duty of military personnel. Sexual relationships and acts amongst soldiers outside service times, regardless of the sexual orientation, are defined to be [...] "irrelevant", regardless of the rank and function of the soldier(s) involved, while harassment or the <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> is considered a transgression, as well as the performance of sexual acts in active service.

50|$|UNCAC is {{the most}} recent of {{a long series of}} {{developments}} in which experts and politicians have recognized the far-reaching impact of corruption and economic crime that undermine the value of democracy, sustainable development, and rule of law. They have also recognized the need to develop effective measures against corruption at both the domestic and international levels. International action against corruption has progressed from general consideration and declarative statements to legally binding agreements. While {{at the beginning of the}} discussion measures were focused relatively narrowly on specific crimes, above all bribery, the understanding of corruption has become broader and so have the measures against it. UNCAC's comprehensive approach and the mandatory character of many of its provisions give proof of this development. UNCAC deals with forms of corruption that had not been covered by many of the earlier international instruments, such as trading in influence, <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>function,</b> and various types of corruption in the private sector. A further significant development was the inclusion of a specific chapter dealing with the recovery of stolen assets, a major concern for countries that pursue the assets of former leaders and other officials accused or found to have engaged in corruption.|$|R

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMCorrupt {{practices}} such as bribery and other <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> public <b>functions</b> for private gain have been criminalised in almost all legal systems. Criminalisation of acts of corruption constitutes {{one of the major}} dimensions of the international anti-corruption instruments. The clandestine nature of corruption crimes creates difficulties in gathering evidence for prosecution and effective implementation of the law. To overcome such problems, some indicators of corruption such as possession of property that far exceeds legitimate sources of income need to be criminalised. It is also imperative to deal with the challenges associated with such criminalisation. This paper tries to analyse the challenges related to due process of law in the investigation and prosecution of illicit enrichment. Further, complexities associated with the process of recovering illicitly acquired assets, such as resources and expertise, as well as effective co-operation among various jurisdictions, need to be explored. Special consideration will be given to the criminalisation of illicit enrichment and its prosecution in the Ethiopian anti-corruption legal framework...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a mechanism which prevents <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> trusted Java applets, such as digitally signed applets. A signed applet is usually permitted by a user to perform certain functions. However, an attacker may improperly recompose the signed applet to include malicious components and harm the user by <b>abusing</b> such <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> a signed applet. In this paper, we call this a malicious recomposition attack and propose an innovative mechanism {{to solve the problem}} of such attacks. Before deployment, a target signed applet is encapsulated into a special signed applet, called a cozilet, in an indecomposable format. On its execution, the cozilet isolates the classes and resources of the encapsulated applet by assigning a special class loader unique to the applet. It also enforces applet-document binding so that it is never executed from untrusted HTML documents. The mechanism is easily applicable to target signed applets because it is transparent not only to target applets, but also to current Java VM implementations. Therefore, the mechanism can easily protect both applets developed in the future and the applets currently in use. We have implemented this mechanism for Sun Java VM. In this paper, we describe its basic architecture and implementation details...|$|R
40|$|Recent codifications of the English and Scottish law {{of sexual}} {{offences}} have highlighted significant difficulties with {{the manner in}} which the criminal law purports to regulate adolescent sexuality. While it is rare for consensual sexual activity between adolescents to be regarded as warranting prosecution, legislators have shied away from reflecting this practice in formal rules. Legislators have instead preferred to maintain excessively broad prohibitions, although the Scottish legislation is not as extreme as the English in its breadth. This article explores the justifications offered by legislators for this approach, and identifies five problems with it: first, the arbitrary nature of prosecutorial discretion; secondly, the deliberate subversion of the presumption of innocence; thirdly, the consequences in terms of alternative verdicts where more serious offences are charged; fourthly, a distorting effect on other aspects of the law of sexual offences and fifthly, an <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> the expressive <b>function</b> <b>of</b> the criminal law. It argues that a rational system of rules in this area of the criminal law is unattainable without legislators being prepared to engage openly in a discussion of the extent to which adolescent sexual behaviour is properly of public concern, which has not been a feature of recent debates...|$|R

Great concerns had been focused on the rules <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power before the AML was promulgated. However, its progress in practice is slow and experiences difficulties after this law took effect. Little research has been undertaken outside <b>of</b> China on <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition due to the specific background and situation pertaining in China. Concerning to <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power, the AML have close relationships with EU competition law and free movement rules. This thesis aims to provide a critical comparison between the AML, Article 106 TFEU of EU competition law and free movement rules, and draws on the EU’s experience as a source of criticism and guidance in relation to the application <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition in the AML. This study first provides a background introduction on the development of the AML and <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition and analyses the complicated causes <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power in competition through three areas: the history of China’s economic system, economic theory and legislation. The main comparative and critical research are held in Chapters Four and Five which examine the relationships between <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power in the AML, Article 106 TFEU and EU free movement rules respectively. In Chapter Six a case study is taken in telecommunications sector.
