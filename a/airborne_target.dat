2500|$|Besides the COIL, {{the system}} also {{includes}} two kilowatt-class Target Illuminator Lasers for target tracking. On March 15, 2007, the YAL-1 successfully fired this laser in flight, hitting its target. The target was an NC-135E Big Crow test aircraft {{that has been}} specially modified with a [...] "signboard" [...] target on its fuselage. The test validated the system's ability to track an <b>airborne</b> <b>target</b> and measure and compensate for atmospheric distortion.|$|E
2500|$|The YAL-1 with a {{low-power}} laser was test-fired {{in flight}} at an <b>airborne</b> <b>target</b> in 2007. [...] A high-energy laser {{was used to}} intercept a test target in January 2010, and the following month, successfully destroyed two test missiles. [...] Funding for the program was cut in 2010 and the program was canceled in December 2011. It made its final flight on February 14, 2012 to Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona {{to be kept in}} storage at the [...] "Boneyard" [...] by the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group. It was ultimately scrapped in September 2014 after all usable parts were removed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prediction}} of the coordinates was {{the function of}} Director T-10, a form of electrical computer so named because {{it was used to}} direct the positioning of the gun with respect to the <b>airborne</b> <b>target.</b> It also calculated the target average velocity based on the location information provided by the radar and predicted the future target location based on its assumed flightpath equation, usually a linear function of time. This system functioned as an early version of the [...] modern Anti-ballistic missile defence model. Statistical analysis was also employed to aid in the computation of the exact position of the enemy aircraft and to smooth the data acquired from the target due to signal fluctuations and noise effects.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{real-time}} visual {{tracking system}} is presented for tracking <b>airborne</b> <b>targets.</b> The algorithm {{is based on}} intensity difference between background and the target in a gray-scale frame. As the background is uniform for videos of <b>airborne</b> <b>targets,</b> decision is made on contrast between tracking gate boundary and the target inside that rectangular gate. The algorithm is embedded on DSP Starter Kit (DSK) 6713 and a 586 embedded controller is used for servo control and processing. A personal computer (PC) provides the user interface for the system. The performance {{of the system is}} verified with different <b>airborne</b> <b>targets</b> from birds to helicopters and its reliability and constraints are presented. ...|$|R

50|$|The AN/FPS-124 is an {{unattended}} Radar (UAR) providing short range, {{doppler radar}} surveillance of <b>airborne</b> <b>targets.</b> It provides target {{information to the}} Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC), and employs built-in-test, performance monitoring/fault isolation and system redundancy enabling it to reconfigure itself when fault detection occurs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ammunition}} and shells fired by these weapons are usually fitted with {{different types of}} fuses (barometric, time-delay, or proximity) to explode close to the <b>airborne</b> <b>target,</b> releasing a shower of fast metal fragments. For shorter-range work, a lighter weapon with {{a higher rate of}} fire is required, to increase a hit probability on a fast <b>airborne</b> <b>target.</b> Weapons between 20 mm and 40 mm calibre have been widely used in this role. Smaller weapons, typically [...]50 calibre or even 8 mm rifle calibre guns have been used in the smallest mounts.|$|E
