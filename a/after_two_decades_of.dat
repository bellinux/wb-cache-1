5|$|Since {{as early}} as 1967, local {{officials}} have discussed building a Manchester bypass, either as a separate project {{or as part of}} a road bypassing both Hampstead and Manchester. However, by the mid-1970s, the town of Manchester decided it did not want the bypass. The bypass was planned to pass to the west of Manchester, but the town allowed a residential subdivision to be built along the bypass route. The planned bypass route was eventually changed to be east of town. <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> disagreement by the town and county over the path of the bypass, in 1993 the bypass was placed in the town's master plan. However, state support for the Manchester bypass was scrapped in 1998 by Smart Growth proponent and governor Parris Glendening, who said the bypass would promote suburban sprawl. The Manchester Bypass is neither in the Maryland Department of Transportation's Consolidated Transportation Program for 2012 to 2017 nor in MDSHA's 2011 Highway Needs Inventory for the next 20 years.|$|E

25|$|Filipino American National Historical Society had {{proposed}} {{the construction of}} the National Pinoy Museum in the Little Manila district.

25|$|Jääkarhu was a Finnish {{and later}} Soviet steam-powered icebreaker. Built in 1926 by P.

25|$|The first {{station in}} the town (then called North Bridgewater) opened in 1846 on the Fall River Railroad. The {{railroad}} helped Brockton grow into a major manufacturing center. In the 1890s, Brockton {{was the site of}} the state's first major grade crossing elimination program, which included the construction of a massive stone viaduct and a pair of station buildings designed by Bradford Gilbert. Passenger service ended in 1959, and the station was demolished during an urban renewal program in the 1960s. <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> planning, the modern station opened for commuter rail service in 1997.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> movies, {{her best}} known films are still arguably The Blue Lagoon (1980), which {{included}} nude scenes between teenage lovers on a tropical island (Shields later testified before a U.S. Congressional inquiry that older body doubles {{were used in}} some of them), and Endless Love (1981). The MPAA initially rated Endless Love with an X rating. The film was re-edited to earn an R rating. She won the People's Choice Award {{in the category of}} Favorite Young Performer in four consecutive years from 1981 to 1984. In 1998, she played a lesbian, Lily, in The Misadventures of Margaret.|$|E
25|$|In 1793, her mother, father, {{and sister}} Deborah Griscom Bolton (1743–93) all died in another severe yellow fever {{epidemic}} (a disease unknowingly caused by infected mosquitoes {{that in those}} times ranged further north from the sub-tropical zones of the southern U.S.). <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> poor health, John Claypoole died in 1817. Mrs. Claypoole (the former Mrs. Ross), continued the upholstery business for 10 more years. Upon retirement, she {{moved in with her}} second Claypoole daughter, Susanna (1786–1875), in a section of Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Her eldest Claypoole daughter, Clarissa (1785–1864), had taken over Betsy's business back in the city.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> owning and {{operating}} Barefoot Contessa, Garten again found herself seeking a change {{and sold the}} store to two employees, Amy Forst and Parker Hodges, while retaining ownership of the building itself. Unsure of what career step to take after selling the store, she took a six-month sabbatical from the culinary scene and built offices above the shop. There, she studied {{the stock market and}} attempted to sketch out plans for potential business ventures. Her website, Barefoot Contessa, became high-profile at this time as she began offering her coffees and a few other items for purchase online.|$|E
25|$|Richmond {{dominated}} the 1967 season, running out winners {{in a classic}} Grand Final against Geelong. In his first two years, the team lost only seven games and Hafey had gone from an unknown coach in the bush to the toast of the football world. In hindsight, the 1967 premiership marked {{a turning point for}} the game. The Tigers were fitter than any team that had gone before and were the highest scoring team since 1950. Australian football, <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> defensive-based play, was about to enter an era of high scoring, aided by rule changes, new tactics and betters standards of fitness.|$|E
25|$|The recent {{moves away}} from {{intervention}} buying, subsidies for specific crops, reductions in export subsidies, have changed the situation somewhat. In the past years intervention has been reduced or abolished in all sectors. <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> significant CAP reforms, farmers can now respond to market signals and increase production {{to react to the}} higher prices. Although the new decoupled payments were aimed at environmental measures, many farmers have found that without these payments their businesses {{would not be able to}} survive. With food prices dropping over the past thirty years in real terms, many products have been making less than their cost of production when sold at the farm gate.|$|E

25|$|A bypass of Baldwinsville {{had been}} {{proposed}} {{as early as}} the 1970s. The earliest concepts for the road called for a long highway connecting NY690 south of the village to NY481 in Clay, east of Lysander. <b>After</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> planning and community input, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) presented four potential alignments for a scaled-back route running from NY48 to NY31 in 1994. Although an alignment encircling the village limits was chosen within four years, work on the project was stalled {{due to a lack of}} funding. In the meantime, NY631 was assigned in 1999 to a series of pre-existing local roads that formed a northern bypass of Baldwinsville between NY48 and NY31. The section of the originally planned southern bypass northeast of NY370 was finally completed in 2001 as an extension of NY631.|$|E
25|$|Rock-throwing {{and mass}} demonstrations had played {{no part in}} Fatah's {{previous}} guerrilla activities, and the uprising came as a complete surprise to the PLO Stone-throwing, which had been intermittent and confined locally, broke out on a large systematic organized and spontaneous grassroots scale and took root with the First Intifada in December 1987 <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> Israeli rule, becoming the major symbol of the intifada itself. Those who participated, among the best-educated in the Middle East, took to brandishing their banned national flag and throwing rocks and molotov-bombs at IDF forces, to express their frustrations at limited opportunities after decades of growing up under Israeli occupation. It has been called 'the first stone-throwing rebellion against Israel.' Shame and guilt for {{not doing enough to}} help their parents or free their land also played a motivational role.|$|E
25|$|The Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari is a 20-minute, one-mile, narrated {{monorail}} ride, which travels {{around the}} watering hole (hippopotamus) rain forest (okapi), mountain (Nubian ibex), woodlands (Grévy's zebra), river (waterbuck, greate white pallicans, Goliath herons, blue cranes), arid desert (scimitar-horned oryx, addra gazelle), semi-arid desert (addax, gemsbok, ostrich) and bush (gerenuk, red-crowned cranes, greater kudu, Thomson's gazelle, marabou storks) exhibits. The monorail features aerial {{views of the}} Simmons Hippo Outpost, Chimpanzee Forest, Nile crocodile, and Penguin Cove exhibits, which are also accessible via the Nature Trail. The monorail originally opened in 1990 but <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> use and over a million passengers, the attraction began to show its age with aging infrastructure and several electrical outages that left passengers stranded on the tour. The final incident in August 2014 prompted zoo officials {{to shut down the}} attraction for evaluation. Following the evaluation the DZS decided a $3 million renovation was in order. On March 25, 2016, the Monorail Safari reopened as the Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari featuring a new sound system, an upgraded station, air-conditioning, upgraded mechanical and electrical components and new graphics on the individual cars. Additionally, a diesel powered tug is now on standby to nudge the trains back to the station {{in the event of a}} power failure.|$|E

25|$|Redpath {{retired from}} Test cricket {{in order to}} devote himself {{full-time}} to proprietorship of an antique business in Geelong. He had already declined the 1975 Ashes tour to tend to this neglected enterprise. However his absence from top cricket was brief. After a season out of the game, he signed for World Series Cricket, lured by a personal visit to Geelong by Kerry Packer’s lieutenant Austin Robertson, and despite Packer’s initial reluctance to contract the Victorian. As with many of his colleagues, the personal costs of supporting the rebel entrepreneur were significant; <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> service to the South Melbourne Cricket Club, Redpath was made persona non grata. In an early world series match at VFL Park Waverley in 1977–78, Redpath snapped his Achilles tendon, an injury that ruled him out for the season. Packer declared that Redpath would be paid for the duration. The Victorian repaid the loyalty by returning again for 1978–79, playing mainly in World Series country cup games. He was recalled for international duties once more, playing two supertests {{at the age of}} 37. At Sydney, against the by then fearsome West Indies XI attack, he took blow after blow on the body, holding out for 143 minutes to make 9, and adding 71 critical runs with David Hookes which contributed to an improbable 10 wicket victory for the Australian XI.|$|E
500|$|In April 2002, Hewson {{was one of}} {{the leaders}} of an effort which {{delivered}} over a million postcards demanding that the facility be shut down; recipients included British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prince Charles, and Norman Askew, head of British Nuclear Fuels Limited. (The message to the first said, [...] "Tony, look me in the eye and tell me I'm safe.") She personally delivered a giant postcard to Blair at 10Downing Street. The Shut Sellafield Campaign had its postcards stocked in Superquinn and Dunnes Stores supermarkets, and Hewson publicly engaged Tesco when they refused to do the same. The campaign was backed by celebrities, including Ronan Keating and Samantha Mumba, and Hewson made many newspaper and radio appearances on its behalf. It was the first prolonged exposure Hewson had to the public eye, <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> mostly being focused upon maintaining her privacy. Her continued activism also meant that she too would not always be around for the couple's children.|$|E
500|$|Seeking divine favour, and {{responding}} to iconophile plots against him, Theophilos reinstated active suppression of the iconophiles and other perceived [...] "heretics" [...] in June 833, including mass arrests and exiles, beatings and confiscations of property. In Byzantine eyes, God seemed indeed to reward this decision: al-Ma'mun died during the first stages of a new, large-scale invasion against Byzantium that {{was intended to be}} the first step in conquering Constantinople itself, and his brother and successor al-Mu'tasim withdrew to focus on internal matters, having trouble establishing his authority, and needing to confront the ongoing rebellion of the Khurramite religious sect under Babak Khorramdin. This allowed Theophilos to achieve a series of modest victories over the next few years, as well as to bolster his forces with some 14,000 Khurramite refugees under their leader Nasr, who was baptized a Christian and took the name Theophobos. The emperor's successes were not particularly spectacular, but coming <b>after</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> defeats and civil war under iconophile emperors, Theophilos felt justified in claiming them as vindication for his religious policy. Consequently, the emperor began to publicly associate himself with the memory of the militarily successful and fanatically iconoclast emperor Constantine V (r. 741–775), and issued a new type of the copper follis coin, minted in huge numbers, which portrayed him as the archetypical victorious Roman emperor.|$|E
