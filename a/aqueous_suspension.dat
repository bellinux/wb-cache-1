30|$|The {{effect of}} metal {{particles}} on the photoluminescence (PL) and the Raman spectra of functionalized SWCNTs in aqueous solutions was systematically investigated by studying three different metal particles (gold, cobalt, and nickel) on three different SWCNT suspensions (DNA-, RNA-, and sodium deoxycholate salt (DOC)-functionalized SWCNTs). Substantial enhancement of the PL intensities was observed, while the Raman spectra remained unchanged, after gold, cobalt, or nickel particles were introduced into RNA-SWCNT <b>aqueous</b> <b>suspensions.</b> Almost {{the same results}} were obtained after the same metal particles were added to DNA-SWCNT <b>aqueous</b> <b>suspensions.</b> However, both the PL and the Raman spectra did not exhibit any change at all after the same metal particles were introduced into DOC-SWCNT <b>aqueous</b> <b>suspensions.</b> The unusual PL enhancements observed in this work cannot {{be accounted for by}} the three well-known mechanisms in the literature: surface-enhanced Raman scattering effect, Förster resonance energy transfer in a rebundling of isolated SWCNTs, and pH changes of the aqueous solutions.|$|R

40|$|The wide {{application}} of engineered carbon nanomaterials (CNMs), such as fullerene (C(60)), inevitably {{will result in}} their introduction into the aqueous environment. It is likely CNMs will associate with abundant natural organic matter (NOM) and engineered surfactants to form stable <b>aqueous</b> <b>suspensions</b> through various environmental processes. The present study reveals that sorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to fullerene resulted in a remarkable decline of freely dissolved PAH concentrations. For the three PAHs studied (phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and chrysene) with log K(OW) {{in the range of}} 4. 56 to 5. 81, the measured sorption coefficients to <b>aqueous</b> <b>suspensions</b> of fullerene (log K(C 60) = 4. 71 - 5. 48) were close to that of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from Aldrich humic acid (log K(DOC) = 4. 48 - 5. 91). <b>Aqueous</b> <b>suspensions</b> of fullerene were stable {{for a wide range of}} pH (3. 0 - 11. 0) and salinity conditions (0 - 25 mM NaCl), and the pH and salinity had minor effects on the sorption of PAHs to <b>aqueous</b> <b>suspensions</b> of fullerene. The addition of humic acids (5 mg/L DOC) to the fullerene (5 mg/L) suspensions resulted in an additional reduction of freely dissolved PAH concentrations. The high PAH sorption coefficients to suspended fullerene suggest that the release of fullerene to the aquatic environment might affect PAH fate and exposures...|$|R
