5000|$|The {{most common}} {{equalizer}} used in monitor systems are graphic equalizers.

Graphic <b>equalizers</b> are fixed <b>frequency</b> <b>equalizers.</b> The center <b>frequency</b> of each band can not be adjusted. The bandwidth or Q of each band can either be 1/3, 2/3 or one octave, giving a 31-band, 15-band, or 10-band graphic equalizer. The narrower the band the more precisely the feedback frequency can be isolated. Normally 31-band equalizers are used, such as a Klark Teknik DN360 or a DBX 1231. [...] Taller units are preferred since the longer slider length gives more precise control over level adjustments.|$|R

Performance improvements can be obtained by judiciously designing a time domain <b>equalizer,</b> a <b>frequency</b> domain <b>equalizer,</b> and by suitable selection of a cyclic prefix. The transceiver front-end filter selection is also very important. In this thesis, we discuss the time domain equalizer design algorithms and the filter selection. The system performance with different filters is analyzed based on computer simulations. We then theoretically analyze the effects of the remaining distortion on the system performance and verify the results by simulations. We propose an optimized <b>frequency</b> domain <b>equalizer</b> for discrete multitone systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Periodic, shunted {{piezoelectric}} patches {{are applied}} for the control of wave propagation in beams. The patches are shunted through resonant circuits featuring a single and multiple resonances. The periodic arrangement of shunted patches provides the beam with attenuation properties which depend on the resonant behavior of the shunts. This article specifically illustrates the effectiveness of periodic shunted patches for passive wave propaga-tion control, and focuses on the application of multi-resonant circuits for the generation of multiple <b>attenuation</b> <b>frequency</b> ranges (bandgaps), which can be tuned to target several struc-tural modes of the beam. A numerical model predicts the attenuation characteristics of the beam for different shunting configurations.

The criterion used to estimate the system convergence time is {{the time it takes}} for the MIMO equalizer to reach an average output error which is within a margin of 5 % of the average output error after 50, 000 symbols. The convergence reduction difference between the TDE and FDE is attributed to the limited maximum step size for stable convergence of the <b>frequency</b> domain <b>equalizer.</b> The adaptive step size requires a small overhead {{in the form of a}} lookup table. It is highlighted that the convergence time reduction is achieved without sacrificing optical signal-to-noise ratio performance...|$|R

We conduct both floating-point and fixed-point error estimations for the design in Simulink and System Generator, respectively. Then, we use formal error analysis based on the theorem proving to verify an implementa-tion of the <b>frequency</b> domain <b>equalizer</b> based on the Fast LMS algorithm. The formal error analysis and simulation based error estimation of the algorithm intend to show that, when converting from one number domain to another, the algorithm produces the same values with an accepted error margin caused by the round-off error accumulation.

40|$|The {{dilution}} {{effects of}} a protein solution and {{of water on the}} <b>attenuation</b> <b>frequency</b> spectrum of a proteinaceous ultrasound contrast agent were compared. The aim was to determine if the properties of the contrast agent changed when diluted in different media. The agent consists of microbubbles intended to be injected into blood, have shells made of a natural blood protein, Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), and are air-filled. The effect of their dilution in both water and in a BSA concentration similar to blood was investigated. <b>Attenuation</b> <b>frequency</b> spectra of multiple, statistically averaged batches is plotted, with noticeable differences between the different dilution media of BSA and water. The attenuation relative to the dilution media was greater when the microbubbles were diluted in BSA than when diluted in water. The response in the BSA solution has a broader peak whereas water has relative statistically similar response for the 1 - 10 MHz frequency range. The difference in the responses was attributed to changes in the microbubble population caused by dilution in the different media...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{object of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of low <b>frequency</b> gain <b>attenuation</b> on scale in single sided deafness. Methods: In present study total of twenty SSD post-lingual subjects with age range of 15 to 40 years. BAHA was programmed with four different settings i. e. without <b>attenuation</b> (WA), low <b>frequency</b> <b>attenuation</b> of 250, 750 and 1500 Hz. Subjective rating scale were used to determine the quality of sound in different condition on brightness, softness, clarity, reverberation, fullness, loudness. Total Time period of 2 hour were given to the subject before rate on the scale so that subject gets habituated to the sounds in which 30 minutes were given to each setting i. e. Statistical analysis and Results: Non parametric test (Friedman Test) was carried results reveal that there was a significant difference in loudness across all experimental conditions tested, indicating loudness decreases as the <b>attenuation</b> <b>frequency</b> increased from 250 Hz to 1500 Hz. Without low <b>frequency</b> <b>attenuation</b> the loudness was higher. This can be attributed to importance of low frequency in perception of loudness. Conclusion: The results from subjective rating scale indicate that there is no deleterious effect on acoustic output quality with low <b>frequency</b> <b>attenuation.</b> But there was significant difference noted in loudness without on with low <b>frequency</b> <b>attenuation,</b> indicating that low frequency gain in the BAHA only adds loudness which is not required for the speech intelligibility.

40|$|The {{model is}} a {{generalisation}} of the Maseng–Bakken model targeting dual–site dual–frequency rain attenuated satellite links. The outcome is a consistent and comprehensive theoretical description of rain fade slope, expected long–term power spectral density of rain <b>attenuation,</b> <b>frequency</b> scaling factor, site diversity and a novel way to compute fade duration statistics using Markov Chains. GENERALIZED MODEL OF RAIN ATTENUATION This work is a generalisation of the stochastic dynamic model first proposed by Maseng and Bakken (MB) in [1] and is also inspired by [2] and [3]. The MB model is extended to two arbitrarily correlated satellite links at two different carrier frequencies. This allows to provide theoretical descriptions of, (i) of rain attenuation’s power spectral density (PSD), (ii) dual-location site diversity systems, (iii) rain <b>attenuation</b> <b>frequency</b> scaling factor and (iv) rain fade slope statistics, [4]. Finally, (v) a new computational method based on Markov chains ([7]) is also applied for evaluating rain fade durations statistics. There is agreement that point rainfall rate can be modelled as a lognormal variable, [5]. An extension is to consider that the joint distribution of rainrate at two points on the horizontal plane is lognormal ([3]) with pdf: fR 1,R 2 (R 1, R 2, r) R 1 R 2 m 1, 1, r, m 2,...|$|R
