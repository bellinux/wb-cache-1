5|$|Robb {{thought that}} the game's format has the {{potential}} to become an eSports game. 2K expressed similar enthusiasm, and added that they would <b>allocate</b> <b>resources</b> into developing eSports-centric features to Evolve if fans of the game expressed demands for it. Turtle Rock and 2K collaborated with Electronic Sports League and Sony Pictures Entertainment to host a special tournament, in which players have to battle Chappie, the titular robot from the film Chappie, in February 2015. A Pro-Am Tournament of Evolve took place on March 6, 2015 during PAX East. During the tournament, they revealed that the eSport future of Evolve is determined. On June 15, 2015, another tournament was hosted by the Electronic Sports League and 2K.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between war and Australian {{society has been}} shaped {{by two of the}} more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture: bandwagoning with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare. Indeed, Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the Japanese crisis of 1942, while since then an alliance with the United States has underwritten its security. Arguably, this pattern of bandwagoning—both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs, as well as for more pragmatic security concerns—has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies. Regardless, a tendency towards strategic complacency has also been evident, with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to <b>allocate</b> <b>resources</b> until a crisis arises; a trait which has historically resulted in unpreparedness for major military challenges.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{destruction}} wrought by Typhoon Durian just weeks prior, preparations began in earnest in the Philippines. Over 91,000people were evacuated from areas at risk, primarily from Albay. Two major summits {{to be held in}} Cebu were postponed {{as a result of the}} forecast inclement weather. In addition, recovery efforts for victims of Durian had to be suspended and all domestic flights in the Philippines were cancelled. Utor's impacts in the central Philippines were extensive, with 30casualties reported and the damage toll reaching US$15.8million. Widespread power outages affected the entirety of Eastern Visayas. Numerous ships sunk as a result of rough seas generated by the typhoon, including a ferry carrying 104passengers and crew. Following the storm, relief agencies began to <b>allocate</b> <b>resources</b> to those affected by the typhoon, in turn also adding to relief efforts for the three Philippine typhoons which preceded Utor. Precautionary efforts also took place in Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, while the Paracel Islands sustained marked damage but no fatalities. Although the storm mostly dissipated in the South China Sea, Utor's remnant moisture later contributed in part to Peninsular Malaysia's worst flood event in recorded history, as copious amounts of precipitation fell over a short, four-day period. Eight people were killed by the floods which were worst in Kota Tinggi and Segamat District.|$|E

25|$|Seeds of {{many plants}} have evolved {{a variety of}} {{defenses}} to deter predation from seed predators. Plants may <b>allocate</b> <b>resources</b> toward physical or chemical defenses. Seeds are often contained inside protective structures or fruit pulp that encapsulate seeds until they are ripe. Other physical defenses include spines, hairs, fibrous seed coats and hard endosperm. Seeds, especially in arid areas, may have a mucilaginous seed coat that can glue soil to seed hiding it from granivores.|$|E

25|$|Electoral stasis is a {{condition}} that can arise when an electorate cannot realistically change its political composition, regardless of the swing occurring in a general election. A safe seat in a single member electoral system {{is one that is}} in electoral stasis. Proportional representation systems, such as STV ballots, can also be in electoral stasis. These “safe seats” can be ignored by political party strategists, who will <b>allocate</b> <b>resources</b> to other electorates.|$|E
25|$|Customer horizon {{indicates}} the market orientation {{of a company}} {{in the case of}} netchains. In a chain and network environment it reflects the ability of companies to identify downstream customers and what they need. The phrase and two measurements of customer horizons, breadth and length, were introduced by Storer, Holman and Pedersen in 2010. The importance of market orientation becomes more complicated in a netchain environment, because it is harder to identify the customers of a specific unit. Therefore, it is even more important for companies to <b>allocate</b> <b>resources</b> for this purpose in netchains.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{this view}} {{on the need for}} more {{stakeholder}} involvement can be framed within the movement in environmental governance calling for a shift from traditional ways of government to governance.

The project will research and present four case studies of how federal or central government money is presently distributed to sub-national entities. Chosen for the diversity in their underlying political systems, these are: China, India, Switzerland, and the USA.|$|E

25|$|To promote industrialization, the {{government}} decided that, while it should help private business to <b>allocate</b> <b>resources</b> and to plan, {{the private sector}} was best equipped to stimulate economic growth. The greatest role of government was to help provide the economic conditions in which business could flourish. In short, government {{was to be the}} guide, and business the producer. In the early Meiji period, {{the government}} built factories and shipyards that were sold to entrepreneurs at a fraction of their value. Many of these businesses grew rapidly into the larger conglomerates. Government emerged as chief promoter of private enterprise, enacting a series of pro-business policies.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{hospitals}} in Windsor: Hôtel-Dieu Grace Healthcare, formally Hôtel-Dieu Grace Hospital, and Windsor Regional Hospital. Hôtel-Dieu Grace Healthcare {{is the result}} of an amalgamation of Grace Hospital and Hôtel-Dieu in 1994. The merger occurred due to the Government of Ontario's province-wide policy to consolidate resources into Local Health Integrated Networks, or LHINs. This was to eliminate duplicate services and <b>allocate</b> <b>resources</b> more efficiently across the region. The policy resulted in the closure of many community-based and historically important hospitals across the province. At this time, Hotel-Dieu Hospital does not do surgeries, nor does it have emergency room services. Its focus has moved away from traditional hospital services and provides more supportive healthcare.|$|E
25|$|Incidents {{are handled}} {{at one of}} three levels: on-scene coordination, at a rescue sub-center or at a JRCC. Most {{land-based}} SAR missions are coordinated at the second level by the local police district. However, the JRCC is kept informed and may offer advise and <b>allocate</b> <b>resources</b> without coordinating the mission. The JRCCs take over control in situation at sea, by aircraft and at offshore installations, {{as well as for}} instances which require international cooperation and prolonged operations. The JRCC may appoint an on-scene coordinator for a search, typically a navy or coast guard vessel. For major accidents, hotlines for next of kin are set up, and crisis psychology and clergy is available to these and search participants. Professional public relations experts are used to handle the media.|$|E

25|$|The {{restructuring}} {{has been}} credited with improvements. To better <b>allocate</b> <b>resources,</b> Fenty and Rhee significantly reduced the school system's central administrative staff and closed 23 schools with low enrollments. After 2007, student achievement tests {{at the secondary level}} reportedly rose 14points in reading and 17points in math. Student SAT scores rose 27points in 2010. Graduation rates rose each year since 2007, and 72 percent of District students took the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT), which functions as a practice test for college bound students. Fenty's administration had also taken on a major, five-year maintenance and construction effort to improve school buildings by 2014. Fenty and Rhee successfully negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the Washington Teachers Union that establishes a system of performance-based teacher compensation.|$|E
25|$|Despite the low {{priority}} accorded to Guam, some minor steps were also taken by other command to improve Guam's defenses before war broke out. A contract for minor {{improvements to the}} military facilities on Guam was issued in April 1941, and work began the next month. The Guam Insular Force Guard, which was a locally manned milita force responsible for protecting the naval base, was also slightly expanded in May. On 17 October the dependents of the American military personnel on the island were evacuated to the United States by the transport , followed by more than 1000 construction workers. On 23 October 1941 the US Navy's General Board provided Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox with a report on Guam's defenses which recommended against reinforcing the island due to the difficulties of defending it {{and the need to}} <b>allocate</b> <b>resources</b> to other priorities. The report argued in favor of continuing to improve Guam's harbour and seaplane facilities, however.|$|E

Humans have access to their ship, the Spirit of Fire, and its special abilities, such as a powerful coilgun called a M.A.C. (Magnetic Accelerator Cannon). Covenant units are generally weaker than their UNSC counterparts, but can use inexpensive and powerful defensive shield generators to add protection to their bases. Players establish their armies by building and expanding bases; these are used to train units and to <b>allocate</b> <b>resources</b> to the research of upgrades and technologies.

500|$|Many {{employees}} left Starbreeze when MachineGames recruited. Then CEO Johan Kristiansson also stepped down, and {{was replaced}} by Mikael Nemark. Nemark took the studio in a new direction. Besides focusing on AAA video games, it would also <b>allocate</b> <b>resources</b> to develop smaller, downloadable games in order to broaden the company's portfolio. These new games would no longer use the engine created by Högdahl. In 2011, Starbreeze announced that it was partnering with Epic Games to use their engine, Unreal Engine, for their first small titles. In 2012, Starbreeze announced Cold Mercury, a free-to-play video game and a project codenamed P13. Prior to that, Josef Fares, an award winning Swedish director, had been unsuccessfully pitching game ideas to several Swedish developers. Starbreeze was in need of new, original properties, and accepted Fares' pitch.
