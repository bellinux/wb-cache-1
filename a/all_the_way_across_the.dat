5|$|Nansen {{first began}} to {{consider}} the possibility of reaching the North Pole by using the natural drift of the polar ice when, in 1884, he read the theories of Henrik Mohn, the distinguished Norwegian meteorologist. Artifacts found on the Greenland coast had been identified as coming from the lost US Arctic exploration vessel Jeannette, which had been crushed and sunk in June 1881 {{on the opposite side of}} the Arctic Ocean, off the Siberian coast. Mohn surmised that the location of the artefacts indicated the existence of an ocean current, flowing from east to west <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> polar sea, possibly over the pole itself. A strong enough ship might therefore enter the frozen Siberian sea, and drift to the Greenland coast via the pole.|$|E

[...] Howe ordered his troops into winter quarters in December, establishing a chain of outposts from New York to Burlington, New Jersey. [...] Washington, in a tremendous boost to American morale, launched a successful strike against the Trenton garrison after crossing the icy Delaware River, prompting Howe to withdraw his chain of outposts back to New Brunswick and the coast near New York, while Washington established his winter camp at Morristown. [...] During the remaining winter months, both sides skirmished frequently as the British sought forage and provisions.|$|E
500|$|The trestle was rebuilt in 1895 by the King Bridge Company {{to address}} public {{concerns}} regarding its stability, {{and it has}} been repeatedly reinforced throughout its existence. Concern over the sturdiness of the trestle has persisted since its opening, and was a major reason Conrail closed the Wallkill Valley rail line in 1977. After the rail line's closure, Conrail sold the bridge in 1986 for one dollar to a private businessman who tried unsuccessfully to operate the trestle as a bungee jumping platform in the 1990s. A similar attempt was made the following decade. The trestle was seized by the county in 2009 for tax nonpayment, and renovated as a pedestrian walkway for the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail.

According to Weiss, [...] "She's not her father and she's not insane and she's not a sadist, but there's a Targaryen ruthlessness that comes with even the good Targaryens". Benioff concluded, [...] "If you're one of the lords of Westeros or one of her potential opponents in the wars to come and you get word of what happened here in Meereen, you have to be pretty nervous because this is an unprecedented threat. You've got a woman who has somehow formed an alliance where she has a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied, she's got the mercenary army of the Second Sons, and she has three dragons who are now pretty close to full grown.

500|$|Washington then retreated across New Jersey, {{followed}} by Howe's advance forces under Charles Cornwallis. At this point, Howe prepared troops {{under the command}} of General Clinton for embarkation to occupy Newport, the other major goal of his plan. [...] Clinton proposed that these troops instead be landed in New Jersey, either opposite Staten Island or on the Delaware River, trapping Washington or even capturing the seat of the Continental Congress, Philadelphia. Howe rejected these proposals, despatching Clinton and General Hugh, Earl Percy, two vocal critics of his leadership, to take Newport. In early December Howe came to Trenton, New Jersey to arrange the disposition of his troops for the winter. [...] Washington had retreated <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Delaware, and Howe returned to New York, believing the campaign to be ended for the season. When Washington attacked the Hessian quarters at Trenton on 26 December 1776, Howe sent Cornwallis to reform the army in New Jersey and chase after Washington. Cornwallis was frustrated in this, with Washington gaining a second victory at Trenton and a third at Princeton. Howe recalled the army to positions much closer to New York for the winter.|$|E
500|$|After {{the failure}} in South Carolina, Clinton and Cornwallis transported their troops north to serve under William Howe in the {{campaign}} for New York City. [...] In the Battle of Long Island, Cornwallis led the reserve division that {{took part in the}} successful flanking of the American position on Gowanus Heights. [...] Cornwallis's role in the following weeks was minor; his command was not directly involved in the battles that drove George Washington across the Hudson River and into New Jersey. [...] At the fall of Fort Washington, Cornwallis's troops sealed one of the last escape routes. General Howe then gave Cornwallis his first chance at an independent command, assigning him to capture Fort Lee across the river from Fort Washington. [...] The Americans occupying that fortification were led by Nathanael Greene, who would later face Cornwallis in the south, and only barely made their escape. [...] Cornwallis's prizes in the bloodless seizure of the fort included tents, guns, and other military supplies. [...] Washington ended up withdrawing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Delaware River into Pennsylvania, with Cornwallis in pursuit until his force reached New Brunswick. [...] His troops were exhausted from the chase, and his orders from Howe were to go no further. [...] Cornwallis, who was criticized for disobeying or disregarding Clinton's orders in later campaigns, observed that he would have disobeyed Howe's orders if he believed further pursuit would have gained material advantage for the British. [...] Howe joined him on December 6, and led the pursuit to the Delaware with Cornwallis in the van. [...] In his orders of December 14, Howe recognized the successful close of the campaign [...] "much to the honor of his lordship and the officers and soldiers under his command." ...|$|E

[...] Rather, he argued for more strategically and visually appealing bunkers placed {{along the edges of}} fairways, stating, [...] "Hazards arranged somewhat upon the lines indicated, rather than slavishly following the system adopted on the great majority of our courses, would, I think, make the game vastly more interesting, and more provocative of better golf all around." ...|$|E

Researches have discovered around 50 species just on the Canary Islands, six of those 50 are associated with the oldest eastern island. The spider population are limited to the highest elevation on Lanzarote and Fuerteventura islands. The most likely reason why Dysdera are abundantly found on the Canary Islands is due to 27 species found on the close shores of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. Groups like Dysdera crocata and Dysdera erythrina found on the two neighboring lands are found more often than Dysdera lata and Dysdera longirostis, which are also found in North Africa and Iberia.
