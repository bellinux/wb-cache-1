60|$|But {{at length}} he overdid the thing; for, drawing his shortsword, he hurled it, javelinwise, at my body, {{at the same}} instant rushing upon me with his long-sword. A single {{sweeping}} circle of my own blade caught the flying weapon and hurled it clattering <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall,</b> and then, as I sidestepped my antagonist's impetuous rush, I let him have my point full in the stomach as he hurtled by.|$|E
60|$|<b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall,</b> {{breathing}} hard and fondling {{his left eye}} with a four-ounce glove, leaned Steve Dingle. His nose was bleeding somewhat freely, but this he appeared to consider a trifle unworthy of serious attention. On the floor, an even more disturbing spectacle, Kirk lay at full length. To Mrs. Porter's startled gaze {{he appeared to be}} dead. He too, was bleeding, but he was {{not in a position to}} notice it.|$|E

6000|$|Obviously this jovial {{frame of}} mind must be taken {{advantage}} of; and Archie's first thought was of the downtrodden Salvatore, to the tale of whose wrongs he had listened so sympathetically on the previous day. Now was plainly the moment for the waiter to submit his grievance, before some ebb-tide caused the milk of human kindness to flow out of Daniel Brewster. With a swift [...] "Cheerio!" [...] in his father-in-law's direction, Archie bounded into the grill-room. Salvatore, the hour for luncheon being imminent but not yet having arrived, was standing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall</b> in an attitude of thought.|$|E
60|$|She {{resolved}} to shut her hot-lidded eyes, but opened {{them in a}} little while to torture herself with the knowledge of that ungeometrical thing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall.</b> Then she saw a child--an untidy, thin-faced little girl of about ten, who must have strayed in from the adjoining flat. This proved--Frau Ebermann groaned again at the way the world falls to bits when one is sick--proved that Anna had forgotten to shut the outer door of the flat when she went to the chemist. Frau Ebermann had had children of her own, but they were all grown up now, and she had never been a child-lover in any sense. Yet the intruder might be made to serve her scheme of things.|$|E
60|$|Beyond {{the well}} was a stone altar, {{shaped like a}} {{truncated}} cone or pyramid, and at some distance away <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall,</b> as she dimly discovered by the lamp that stood upon the altar, cut in relief upon that wall indeed, a colossal cross to which, vigorously if rudely executed in white stone, hung the image of Christ crucified, the crown of thorns upon His drooping head. Now she understood. Whatever {{may have been the}} first worship to which this place was dedicated, Christians had usurped it, and set up here the sacred symbol of their faith, awful enough to look upon in such surroundings. Doubtless, also, the shell-shaped basin at the entrance had served the worshippers in this underground chapel as a stoup for holy water.|$|E

60|$|He opened {{what seemed}} to be a little {{mahogany}} box, looked at the ball of black substance inside, closed it up, placed it <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall,</b> untwisted the coil, stood back near the door and pressed the button. The result was extraordinary. The whole of the far wall was blown out and for some distance in front the ground was furrowed up by the explosion. Quest replaced the instrument in his pocket, sprang through the opening and ran for the tower house. Behind him, on its way to New York, he could see a freight train coming along. He could hear, too, Red Gallagher's roar of anger. It was less than fifty yards, yet already, as he reached the shelter of the tower, the thunder of the freight sounded in Quest's ears. He glanced around. Red Gallagher and his mate were racing almost beside it towards him. He rushed up the narrow stairs into the signal room, tearing open his coat to show his official badge.|$|E
5000|$|The boy pensively {{asks the}} girl if they {{themselves}} {{or any of}} the strange world they live in really exists, or if it is merely a memory like his image of the sleeping bird. The girl suddenly insists that the bird does exist, and leads the boy down corridors of ancient fossils to arrive at a chapel-like alcove. The boy looks on aghast; <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall</b> is the fossilized skeleton of an angel. The girl explains her intent to hatch the egg and return it to the [...] "bird" [...] she'd found. The boy solemnly explains this was what he had suspected all along.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} much {{conjecture}} as to {{the identity of the}} groom in this painting. Gilbert Highet has argued that the groom is the man in the centre of the painting, wearing a dark coat and seen in profile, or the ill-bred son of a wealthy couple, seen <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall,</b> {{to the right of the}} bride, eating with a spoon, same as Gustav Glück. It has also been suggested that according to contemporary custom, the groom is not seated at the table but may be the man pouring out beer. Or he may be according to the same custom serving the food instead. According to this theory, the groom is the young man wearing a red cap, who is serving his guests the food, handing out plates to his guests.|$|E

5000|$|Harris' drums were firstly set up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall</b> of the studio's main {{recording}} room, Wessex Studio 1, {{and were}} microphoned in [...] "the usual rock arrangement", using [...] "about ten microphones all {{close to the}} kit - bass drum, snare, hi-hat, tom-toms, overheads, ambient etc." [...] Following this, Brown and Hollis rented the Telefunken U47, a large-diaphragm condenser valve microphone manufactured by Georg Neumann GmbH during the years 1949-1965. They chose it from an offering of several valve mics, which besides the U47 included a Neumann U48, M49 and [...] "Tube", alongside [...] "the old Wessex Collection" [...] which included three AKG C12As. They carefully listened to each before settling on the U47. However, they placed it [...] "30 {{feet away from the}} kit near the control-room window," [...] which became an issue as the physical distance triggered a delay of 26-32 milliseconds.|$|E
50|$|The {{bodies of}} Jay and Ruth Hunter were {{discovered}} the following day, December 29, 1981, after {{the police were}} alerted that {{the front door of}} the residence was wide open and a window on the side of the door was broken out. The police found both bodies in the master bedroom. The body of Jay Hunter was on the bed; that of Ruth Hunter was lying <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall,</b> on top of the telephone receiver. Eight expended shotgun casings were found on the floor. Autopsies revealed that Ruth Hunter had died of two shotgun wounds to the head, either of which was sufficient to cause death. Jay Hunter had suffered four shotgun wounds. One shot to the upper chest that had apparently caused death was fired from a distance. Three other shots, to the neck, abdomen and left knee, had been fired from much closer range and were consistent with having been inflicted where the victim lay.|$|E
50|$|The Old West Church {{stands in}} a rural area of Calais, 0.8 mi south of the {{crossroads}} village of Kents Corner, {{on the west side of}} Old West Road. It is a tall single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and stone foundation. A three-stage tower rises above the front facade, with a square first stage housing the belfry, and two octagonal stages of decreasing size. The main facade has a bank of three similar entrances, each flanked by pilasters, and all set under a common entablature and cornice. Sash windows flank this assemblage, and a second level also has three sash windows. The interior has a vestibule with stairs leading to a gallery level on either side, and is otherwise a single large chamber. The gallery extends on three sides, supported by square posts. The pulpit is <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall,</b> and the interior is filled with original plain pine box pews.|$|E

50|$|At this point, {{the guests}} are {{moving from the}} {{original}} building up into the specially constructed part of the ride, but due to the careful continuation of theming, {{it is difficult to}} tell where this occurs. They turn to the left past the bookcase and along a short, low-ceilinged 'stone' corridor - once again similarly decorated {{to the rest of the}} attraction - where they wait at two doors for entry into the vault. The scaffolding running along the corridor discourages the guests from getting close enough to touch the walls, as although the previous show areas in the building are real original stone, the walls of this 'stone' section are fibreglass cladding, which sounds hollow when tapped. The vault itself is a large hall-like structure, with the decorative ceiling supported by stone pillars, and shelves containing dusty artefacts lit with flickering candles. It contains the branch itself, chained to a long ledge that runs along the middle of the room, two rows of lap-bar benches that face the branch and a large machine, covered in lights and dials, which the Earl supposedly used in his experiments, which is located up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall</b> and wired to one end of the branch.|$|E
5000|$|In {{one of his}} {{guardroom}} interiors {{referred to}} as [...] (At Sotheby's London sale of 7 July 2010, lot 12) Teniers included his own portrait at about 36 years of age. The artist has dossed himself out as an officer wearing an exotic fur-trimmed coat and a fur hat with plume. This self-portrait within this picture may have been intended as a tronie, which often depicted a stock character in an exotic costume. David Teniers combined the genres of singerie and guardroom scene in the composition [...] (Private collection). At a first glance, the Guardroom with Monkeys {{is no different from}} other guardroom scenes. It is clear from the round moon above the door that the scene is set late at night. The off-duty monkeys have removed their armor, stowed their pikes and rolled up their company flag and placed it <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall.</b> Like their human counterparts, the monkey soldiers are loitering about, some of them are drinking and smoking, others are playing games. At the door a cat wearing respectable civilian clothes is led into the room by two monkeys who restrain it. The contrast between the properly dressed cat and the bizarre outfit of the monkey soldiers, one of which is wearing a funnel on his head while another has an upturned pot on his head, raises doubt as to the legitimacy of the monkeys' authority. As was customary in singeries, the dress and behaviour of the monkeys highlight the foolishness of human undertakings. Teniers may also have intended to criticize the bloated military in the Southern Netherlands in the 1630s.|$|E

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{combined}} effects of gravitational and optical stimulation on perceived target elevation, we independently altered gravitational-inertial force {{and both the}} orientation {{and the structure of}} a background visual array. While being exposed to 1. 0, 1. 5, or 2. 0 Gz in the human centrifuge at NASA Ames Research Center, observers attempted to set a target to the apparent horizon. The target was viewed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall</b> of a box that was pitched at various angles. The box was brightly illuminated, had only its interior edges dimly illuminated, or was kept dark. Observers lowered their target settings as Gz was increased; this effect was weakened when the box was illuminated. Also, when the box was visible, settings were displaced {{in the same direction as}} that in which the box was pitched. We attribute our results to the combined influence of otolith-oculomotor mechanisms that underlie the elevator illusion and visual-oculomotor mechanisms (optostatic responses) that underlie the perceptual effects of viewing pitched visual arrays...|$|E
40|$|A three–dimensional {{multiphase}} {{model of}} steady turbulent flow and heat transfer in continuous cast steel {{has been developed}} using the finite–difference program CFX 4. 2. This model {{was used to evaluate}} the accuracy of different turbulence models in the difficult task of predicting flow behavior near a wall where there is jet impingement. Liquid steel enters the mold domain through a nozzle. The jet traverses across the cavity to impinge <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>wall.</b> Three turbulence models have been compared: the standard K–ε model, the Low Reynolds Number K–ε (Low K–ε) model at varying grid sizes, and a version of the K–ε model with a user supplied wall function for heat transfer. The predicted flow patterns for the standard and user modified K–ε models match well with experimental measurements found in the literature. The Low K–ε model is very sensitive to grid resolution and only matches experimental flow results at extremely fine grid resolutions. The calculation of heat transfer is more difficult. The standard K–ε model greatly under–predicts heat flux and the Low K–ε model over–predicts heat flux in the jet impingement zone. Only the K–ε model with user supplied wall functions appears capable of matching experimental heat transfer results...|$|E
