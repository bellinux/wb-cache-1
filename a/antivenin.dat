40|$|In {{view of the}} {{multiplicity}} of methods used at present for the preparation and assay of <b>antivenins</b> and {{as a first step}} towards the international standardization of <b>antivenins,</b> it seemed advisable to make a comparative study of the methods used in the institutes specializing in the production of these sera. With this end in view, the author circulated to the serologists of institutes concerned a detailed questionnaire on the assay methods used for the determination of the neutralization potency of the various types of <b>antivenins</b> prepared under their direction. The information supplied by these institutes is reproduced, in condensed form, in this report and is analysed by the author...|$|R

25|$|Although {{technically}} the <b>antivenin</b> CroFab {{could be}} used to treat an envenomation, it is usually not administered for copperheads, as the risk of complications of an allergic reaction to the treatment are greater than the risk from the snakebite itself in most cases. The <b>antivenin</b> can cause an immune reaction called serum sickness. Pain management, antibiotics, and medical supervision in the case of complications is usually the course of action. In 2002, an Illinois poison control center report on the availability of <b>antivenin</b> stated it used 1 Acp to 5 Acp depending on the symptoms and circumstances. The symptoms of a mild envenomation include swelling of the hand, mild cellulitis, and respiratory distress. The symptoms of a moderate envenomation would include swelling of the hand, vomiting, mild bleeding, ecchymosis, diaphoresis, sinus tachycardia, and hypotension.|$|E
25|$|In any case, <b>antivenin</b> {{therapy and}} {{intravenous}} hydration {{within hours of}} the bite are vital for survival. At least eight different polyvalent and monovalent antivenins are available against bites from this species.|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{lethality}} {{as well as}} the biochemical and histological {{effects of}} Cobra (Naja haje) envenomation at a sublethal dose has been investigated in mice and rats. The venom injected intraperitoneally in rats (0. 2 mg/kg) produced marked increase in the activities of ALT, AST, ALP and LDH. Also, serum glucose, urea and creatinine levels were significantly elevated. These results are in accordance with the histological findings of the liver that showed vacuolated hepatocytes and scattered necrotic and haemorrhagic areas together with congestion and dilatation of blood vessels and sinusoids. The spleen also displayed small diffuse white pulps with ill-defined outlines and extravasation of blood that extended to infiltrate the widened sinusoids. The venom also produced severe degeneration of the cardiac muscle with loss of striations and extensive haemorrhage inbetween the myocardial bundles. These biochemical and histological envenomation disorders, were markedly and effectively neutralized by the polyantivenins (non-irradiated and gamma-irradiated in a sterilizing dose of 25 kGy). The neutralization ability of both <b>antivenins</b> was the same against a lethal dose of the venom (2. 5 LD 50). The minimal protective dose of the polyantivenins was calculated to be 16000 µg/ 20 gm mouse. Rats injected with mixtures of venom and <b>antivenins</b> (non-irradiated and irradiated) showed a decrease in all elevated biochemical parameters investigated. The histological examination also showed less severe injuries in all organs examined (liver, spleen and heart) which appeared more or less normal with very few abnormalities remaining. Comparative study was also done on these <b>antivenins</b> using immunodiffusion technique which showed the same precipitin bands with the tested venom. Thus, it can be concluded that both <b>antivenins</b> (non irradiated and 25 KGy gamma-irradiated) have similar immunoglobulins and have no differences in their antilethal and enzymatic neutralizing ability as well as in ameliorating the degree of tissue damage induced by the venom...|$|R
50|$|Bites {{result in}} mild {{symptoms}} that include pain, moderate swelling, local lymphadentitis and mild fever.

25|$|Ovine-derived antivenom, CroFab, for North American pit viper {{envenomation}} {{has been}} widely available since 2001.

25|$|These snakes produce {{cytotoxic}} venom that {{is strongly}} hemorrhagic and tissue toxic, but {{devoid of any}} neurotoxins (Ernst, 1992; Van Mierop, 1976). The venom was basis {{for the development of}} the drug eptifibatide which is used to prevent clotting during a heart attack. The venom is somewhat different in that it contains substantial amounts of serotonin and related tryptamine compounds (Welsh, 1967). <b>Antivenin</b> does not appear to be effective in the treatment of these bites, although CroFab does seem to do a better job than ACP, at least in some animal models. (Consroe et al., 1995).|$|E
25|$|First aid for {{scorpion}} stings {{is generally}} symptomatic. It includes strong analgesia, either systemic (opiates or paracetamol) or locally applied (such {{as a cold}} compress). Hypertensive crises are treated with anxiolytics and vasodilators. Scorpion envenomation with high morbidity and mortality is usually due to either excessive autonomic activity and cardiovascular toxic effects or neuromuscular toxic effects. Antivenom is the specific treatment for scorpion envenomation combined with supportive measures including vasodilators in patients with cardiovascular toxic effects and benzodiazepines when there is neuromuscular involvement. Although rare, severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis to scorpion <b>antivenin</b> (SAV) are possible.|$|E
25|$|Beyond initial first aid, antihistamines such as {{diphenhydramine}} (Benadryl) may control {{skin irritation}} (pruritus). Ice or fresh water {{is not usually}} applied to stings, since they may cause nematocysts to continue to release toxin. Immunobased <b>antivenins</b> have been available since the 1970s; administration requires medical personnel and refrigeration and are used in extreme cases as {{with regard to the}} box jellyfish, Chironex fleckeri.|$|R
50|$|Bothriechis venom is {{primarily}} a haemotoxin which causes severe pain, swelling, bleb formation, bruising, and quite often necrosis. If untreated {{it can lead to}} loss of a limb, or even death. Each year several farmers and plantation workers are bitten by eyelash vipers, sometimes resulting in fatalities. Wyeth in the United States and Instituto Clodomiro Picado in Costa Rica both manufacture different polyvalent <b>antivenins</b> which can be used to treat eyelash viper envenomations.|$|R
25|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} corporation Eli Lilly and Company gave thiomersal {{the trade}} name Merthiolate. It {{has been used}} as a preservative in vaccines, immunoglobulin preparations, skin test antigens, <b>antivenins,</b> ophthalmic and nasal products, and tattoo inks. Its use as a vaccine preservative was controversial, and it was phased out from routine childhood vaccines in the European Union, and a few other countries in response to popular fears. The current scientific consensus is that these fears are unsubstantiated.|$|R
25|$|The {{treatment}} for a snakebite is as variable as the bite itself. The most common and effective method is through antivenom (or <b>antivenin),</b> a serum made from the venom of the snake. Some antivenom is species-specific (monovalent) while some is made for use with multiple species in mind (polyvalent). In the United States for example, all species of venomous snakes are pit vipers, {{with the exception of}} the coral snake. To produce antivenom, a mixture of the venoms of the different species of rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths is injected into the body of a horse in ever-increasing dosages until the horse is immunized. Blood is then extracted from the immunized horse. The serum is separated and further purified and freeze-dried. It is reconstituted with sterile water and becomes antivenom. For this reason, people who are allergic to horses are more likely to suffer an allergic reaction to antivenom. Antivenom for the more dangerous species (such as mambas, taipans, and cobras) is made in a similar manner in India, South Africa, and Australia, although these antivenoms are species-specific.|$|E
25|$|The {{red-headed}} krait is {{an extremely}} venomous snake, although bites are reported rarely. Krait venom appears to function primarily as a neurotoxin, preventing communication across neuromuscular synapses, causing paralysis and death by asphyxiation because the victims can no longer breathe on their own. When the venom from the red-headed krait takes effect, the most highly innervated muscles {{are the first to}} suffer: the muscle that elevates the upper eyelid and the ocular and ciliary muscles controlling the lens. Between 20minutes and several hours after being bitten, the victim may have a real struggle to keep his or her eyelids open. This medical condition is known as bilateral ptosis and it is a classic, tell-tale sign of severe envenomation. Other common symptoms include diplopia, dysphagia, vomiting, headache, and hypersalivation. Sometime later the symptoms of paralysis tend to worsen, with progressive involvement of various muscles, including those of the jaws, in some cases, become locked. Respiratory distress may occur as a result of paralysis of the diaphragm, the main muscle controlling breathing. Its venom also contains a novel postsynaptic neurotoxin, termed κ-flavitoxin, which is a potent inhibitor of nicotinic transmission in autonomic ganglia. Neurotoxic symptoms may resolve naturally, or more rapidly through administration of <b>antivenin</b> or drugs that inactivate acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which naturally destroys the chemical messenger carrying signals from nerves to muscles at the neuromuscular synapse.|$|E
2500|$|Causus venom is {{weaker than}} that of puff adder. Envenomation {{normally}} causes only local pain and swelling. <b>Antivenin</b> treatment should not be necessary. Nevertheless, South African polyvalent serum {{is known to be}} effective against the venom of at least two species. [...] However, envenomation can be very serious and in at least one case a bitten child had to have a fasciotomy. [...] A number of small dogs have had limbs amputated or died due to bites from this snake. The danger from this snake should not be underestimated as a bite from a large individual on a small child could potentially be fatal.|$|E
40|$|Snake venoms {{are complex}} toxin mixtures. Viperidae and Crotalidae venoms, which are hemotoxic, are {{responsible}} for most of the envenomations around the world. Administration of <b>antivenins</b> aimed at the neutralization of toxins in humans is prone to potential risks. Neutralization of snake venom toxins has been achieved through different approaches: plant extracts have been utilized in etnomedicine. Direct electric current from low voltage showed neutralizing properties against venom phospholipase A 2 and metalloproteases. This mini-review summarizes new achievements in venom key component inhibition. A deeper knowledge of alternative ways to inhibit venom toxins may provide supplemental treatments to serum therapy...|$|R
5000|$|Clodomiro Picado Twight (April 17, 1887 - May 16, 1944), {{also known}} as [...] "Clorito Picado", was a Costa Rican scientist, born in Nicaragua, who was {{recognized}} for his research and discoveries. He was {{a pioneer in the}} researching of snakes and serpent venoms; his internationally recognized achievement is the development of various <b>antivenins.</b> His work on molds was a precursor to the formal discovery of penicillin.

50|$|In some regions, farmers keep mussuranas as pets {{in order}} to keep their living {{environment}} clear of pit vipers, which claim annually a large number of deaths of domestic animals, like cattle. In the 1930s a Brazilian plan to breed and release large numbers of mussuranas for the control of pit vipers was tried but didn't work. The Butantan Institute in São Paulo, which specializes in the production of <b>antivenins,</b> erected a statue of Clelia clelia as its symbol and a tribute to its usefulness in combating venomous snake bites. The mussurana's immunity to bothropic venom was studied by the Brazilian scientist Vital Brazil in the 1920s.|$|R
2500|$|Bites {{can cause}} pain, {{swelling}}, hemorrhagic bleb formation, and ecchymosis. Any swelling {{is usually not}} particularly severe, but it can involve all of the affected limb, {{as well as the}} trunk. Systemic symptoms can include nausea, dizziness, chills, coagulopathy, and shock. Klauber (1997) includes an account {{of a man who had}} been bitten on the first joint of the index finger of the right hand, with only a single fang penetrating. Although the bite was described as no more painful than a pin prick, a doctor was seen within about 25 minutes, and 10 cc of <b>antivenin</b> were administered. Within 2.5 hours, his entire arm was swollen and the pain was severe, [...] "as if the arm were soaked in a bucket of boiling oil." ...|$|E
50|$|Because several venoms of {{different}} snakes are injected over time, the horse will develop different antibodies {{against all the}} venoms. This gives the <b>antivenin</b> its polyvalent property. This also enhances the potency of the <b>antivenin.</b> Some venoms cannot induce the immune system enough on its own or the combination {{of two or more}} venoms result in a better responding <b>antivenin.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} snake charmers {{were likely}} traditional healers by trade. As {{part of their}} training, they learned to treat snake bites.

The practice eventually spread to nearby regions, ultimately reaching North Africa and Southeast Asia.The early 20th century proved something of a golden age for snake charmers. Governments promoted the practice to draw tourism, and snake charmers were often sent overseas to perform at cultural festivals and for private patrons. In addition, the charmers provided a valuable source of snake venom for creating <b>antivenins.</b>|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{systematic}} {{is important}} in solving the problematic taxonomy of venomous snakes and development of <b>antivenins.</b> The current study aimed to investigate the molecular phylogeny of 4 venomous species in Saudi Arabia using mitochondrial (mt) 16 S rRNA gene.

Sequences submitted to gene bank, examined for similarity with other sequences in the data base using BLAST search, aligned using Clustal W method, and phylogenetic tree was constructed. E. coloratus clustered as a separate group along with the isolate from Oman and Yemen with insignificant relation. Cerastes and Bitis arietans groups strongly correlated as sister taxa. The current B. arietans sample did not significantly correlate to the previously published sample from the same province (Taif). Cerastes groups did not significantly correlate with samples from Egypt or Israel. This information might reflect the need for multiple gene markers for better molecular systematic. </p...|$|R
40|$|Ramon, in 1922 (10), {{pointing}} out the apparent advantages of having an in vitro method of titrating diphtheria antitoxin, and recalling that previous authors (3) had used the precipitation technique to achieve an approximate titration {{of the strength of}} antisera (such as the <b>antivenins),</b> reported his discovery that diphtheria toxin and antitoxin, when mixed in the proper proportions, would precipitate (focculate) specifically. He proposed a method of titration, now known by his name, which consisted in mixing in successive tubes a fixed amount of toxin with decreasing amounts of antitoxin. He stated that the precipitate from the one of such mixtures which flocculated fastest was "neutral, " as demonstrated by injection into guinea pigs. He therefore suggested that the method could be used to compare the strength of two different antitoxins, by titrating them in vitro against the same toxin. In Ramon's method the total volume of liquid in the various tubes was not quite the same, as no compensating amount of salt solution was added to the tubes receiving less antitoxin. In 1926, Dean and Webb (4) introduced a similar titration, but with a rather important difference. They made mixtures containing the same amount of antibod...|$|R

5000|$|In Brazil, Slotta {{initially}} {{worked on}} the chemistry of coffee, from which bean oil he extracted a substance he called [...] "cafestol" [...] that he reported had estrogenic properties. As a result, European pharmaceutical companies sought to duplicate his work, {{in the hope of}} producing steroidal sex hormone from such an abundant and inexpensive material. The project proved unsuccessful, however, Slotta was recognized with an appointment at the Instituto Butantan, a Brazilian biomedical research center of the São Paulo State Secretary of Health, located near the campus of the University of São Paulo. In 1935 he was appointed director of the Chemical Institute, primarily engaged in the production of <b>antivenins</b> to treat local farmers. In time, the Institute developed basic and applied biomedical research in many areas, including molecular biology, immunology and epidemiology. The center has a graduate training program in collaboration with other institutions, in the areas of biotechnology and infectology, with research laboratories, production units and specialized library. Slotta, a sterol chemist, studied medical applications of snake venom. In 1938, Slotta and his brother-in-law Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat isolated crotoxin from venom, the first snake toxin to be isolated in crystalline form. Their research suggested that the toxicity of crotoxin was due to effects on nerve lipids. He subsequently co-founded a biopharmaceutical company.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} carried out on horses {{belonging}} to the Holding Company for Biological Products and Vaccines (VACSERA). Two immunization protocols used for preparation of polyspecific horse <b>antivenins</b> were evaluated. The first and second immunization schedules followed by a rest period of about one month ended by re-immunization schedule. The antivenoms were raised to venoms {{of the four major}} snakes of South Sinai (three vipers”Cerastes cerastes, Echis coloratus, Pseudocerastes fieldi ” and the elapid ‘Walterinnesia aegyptia”). Therapeutical titers were obtained by applying the two immunization schedules however, a faster response was obtained by using a mixture of venoms rather than individual venoms. Furthermore, although the preparation of polyspecific antisera to a group of venoms is less costly, the data showed that it is practical to prepare polyspecific antivenom to a group of vipers not for both vipers and elapids. Eventually, the most logical procedure for preparation of polyspecific antisera to a group of vipers and elapids is by mixing antisera raised for vipers with another raised for elapids. So this work achieved the aims of producing potent polyvalent antivenom suitable for use in a specific area and replacing the already present technique (in vitro mixing of monospecific antivenom prepared separately in horses) by immunization of horses with the different venoms as well as preparation of polyspecific antivenom from single horse.

40|$|Internationally {{there is}} an {{increased}} {{need to come up}} with new therapeutics to counteract cases of microbial resistance which is diminishing successes of current pharmaceuticals. Traditional medicines have been in use since time memorial and they offer better options as a source of new lead compounds as compared to synthetic designs and libraries. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity of TLC isolated phytocompounds from Zanthoxylum humile roots. Disc diffusion method was employed to determine antibacterial activity while micro-plate serial dilution method was used to evaluate the minimum inhibitory concentration of crude fractions. Anti-inflammatory activity was ascertained by the nitrite assay. The present study results reveals that Zanthoxylum humile roots consist of antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity can be explained in terms of alkaloids, saponins, tannins and flavonoids present in the extracts. Zanthoxylum humile roots TLC isolates revealed significantly greater antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity as compared to standard drugs cotrimoxazole and indomethacin. Results of the present study authenticate the use of Zanthoxylum humile roots in primary health care needs. Presence of phytocompounds such as flavonoids, saponins, tannins, alkaloids, terpenoids and steroids supports its use as medication for diarrhea, hypertension, diabetes, coughs and flu and as <b>antivenins</b> against snake bites. The presence of various bioactive compounds makes Zanthoxylum humile a promising plant as a source of new therapeutics that may be the answer to the current microbial resistance...|$|R
