5|$|Raymond {{purchased}} {{land in the}} Nishi Azabu {{district of}} Tokyo to build his new office and living quarters. The office was built using the traditional Japanese post and lintel type construction using unplaned timber logs. The office served as a proving ground for the latest American building innovations including veneered plywood and suspended metal ductwork for forced <b>air</b> <b>heating.</b> Taking influence from Le Corbusier's modulor, Raymond used the traditional Japanese module of the ken (based upon the size of tatami mats) as a unit of measure to set out the building's structure. Again he used fusuma partitions and shoji screens, but in a modern way to divide up the spaces.|$|E

40|$|This project {{focuses on}} Earth <b>Air</b> <b>Heat</b> Exchanger which is {{reducing}} energy consumption in a building. The air is {{passing through the}} buried tubes and heat exchange takes place between air and surrounding soil. This equipment helps to reduce energy consumption of an air conditioning unit. This project analyses the thermal performance of earth <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger by using computational fluid dynamics modeling. The model is validated against experimental observations and investigations on an experimental setup in Ajmer. Simulation results are in fair agreement with experimental data. Effects of pipe materials on thermal performance of earth <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers are also studied for summer conditions in Mumbai.

40|$|The {{concept of}} exhaust <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> pumps {{has been put}} forward decades ago. With the ongoing push towards drastic heat loss {{reductions}} in the residential systems, it is put forward again by simple exhaust ventilation manufacturers as an alternative for the traditional heat recovery with an <b>air</b> to <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger that is common in mechanical ventilation systems. As with the latter form of heat recovery, the amount of effectively recovered energy is composed of different forms of energy, namely heat and power. The potential for exhaust <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> pumps, compared to <b>air</b> to <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> exhangers, is assessed by introducing the equivalent heat recovery effectiveness, combining both forms of energy into a single unit based on primary energy and consumer price. Based on lab measurements {{of the performance of}} the heat pumps and assumptions on domestic hot water usage derived from both literature and field measurements, a dynamic model for exhaust <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> pumps in residential buildings was developed, providing detailed performance data for the assessment of the equivalent heat recovery effectiveness. The results show that the equivalent heat recovery effectiveness for these systems is low. Based on the results presented, we conclude that a thorough assessment of the specific boundary conditions is necessary to assess the potential of exhaust <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> pumps in every single project...|$|R

25|$|Another {{trick is}} to cool the {{building}}'s thermal mass at night, and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day. It helps {{to be able to}} route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> solar collector with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the thermal mass. On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky facing radiators can cool below freezing.|$|E

The simulative studying results shows that in winter the solar assisted <b>air</b> source <b>heat</b> pump unit can make full use of solar energy and the coefficient of performance (COP) of <b>air</b> source <b>heat</b> pump can be improved. In summer the cooling <b>heat</b> of <b>air</b> source <b>heat</b> pump could be recovered to improve the stability of solar hot water collector and the COP of the <b>air</b> source <b>heat</b> pump unit is greatly improved.

40|$|The {{following}} article concerns {{results of}} analysis of gas turbine (GT) with <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> recovery turbine unit (AHRTU) using General Electric GateCycle software. The analysis were conducted for five different variants of <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> recovery turbine units: simple AHRTU, with air cooling by one intercooler, with air cooling by two intercoolers, with variable humidity before the compressor, with water injection into the compressor. Each variant was tested for four different air temperatures before air turbine (ATBAT) : 573 K, 673 K, 773 K, and 873 K. For each air temperature before air turbine computations were run for increasing compression ratio (CR) : from 3 to 6, 5 for variants 1 and 4 and from 3 to 12 for other. The results were shown as graphs of specific power (SP) of <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> recovery turbine unit versus compression ratio in <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> recovery turbine unit...|$|R

25|$|The two C.A.15Cs were {{all-metal}} aircraft {{apart from}} the fabric-covered wings and tail surfaces. The fuselage, cabin and empennage were the same in both versions. The tailplane was braced and the fin and rudder rather angular and flat-topped, the rudder horn-balanced. Because the Air Ministry envisaged the aircraft going to Imperial Airways after the trials, the cabins were fully fitted out for ten passengers, with two compartments containing six and four seats placed singly {{on either side of}} a central aisle. Warm <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> was fed from the engines. Between the enclosed cockpit for the two crew and the passenger cabins was a baggage compartment.|$|E
40|$|Gtherm is an {{innovation}} company {{who has an}} unique <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger underdevelopment. The purpose of this thesis is to provide data of suitable motors for theheat exchanger and to find suitable motor suppliers. A motor specification was designed. It is an important basis for the search of suitablemotors. A compilation was made of nine motor suppliers and the suitable motorsfrom those. The compilation {{can be used by}} GTherm in their choice of suppliers andmotors. The compilation of the demands on the motor and analysis of suppliers indicated thatthere were no standard motors available to GTherms <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger. Adaptationof motor is required to meet the system requirements. Power Efficiency is the keyword for an <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger so tests were performedon prototype to calculate this. Suppliers have long delivery time for customizedmotors and {{because of the lack of}} time a borrowed standard motor was used for themeasurement. The motor was satisfactory enough to perform the tests but wouldprobably not have been selected for the production of the <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger. Basedon measured data, electric power (SFP) was calculated for the prototype. The resultsshowed that <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> exchange system was non electrical efficiency because theestimated SFP value was too high. This is probably because the prototype had gaps inthe sealing that produced air leakage...|$|R

Mission-specific equipment can also be installed in the externally accessible separate baggage compartment, which can be optionally expanded. Optional cabin equipment includes soundproofing, air conditioning, and bleed <b>air</b> <b>heating.</b> Aftermarket cabin configurations are offered by third parties; Pininfarina and Versace have both offered designer interiors for the AW109, while Aerolite Max Bucher has developed a lightweight emergency medical service interior. The majority of AW109s are fitted with a retractable wheeled tricycle undercarriage, providing greater comfort than skids and taxiing capability. For shipboard operations, the wheeled landing gear is reinforced, deck mooring points are fixed across the lower fuselage, and extensive corrosion protection is typically applied.|$|E
2500|$|In 1819 {{he moved}} his father's school [...] "Hill Top" [...] from central Birmingham, {{establishing}} the Hazelwood School at Edgbaston, an affluent neighbourhood of Birmingham, as an [...] "educational refraction of Priestley's ideas".

The school, which Hill designed, included innovations such as a science laboratory, a swimming pool, and forced <b>air</b> <b>heating.</b> In his Plans for the Government and Liberal Instruction of Boys in Large Numbers Drawn from Experience (1822, often cited as Public Education) he argued that kindness, instead of caning, and moral influence, rather than fear, should be the predominant forces in school discipline. Science was to be a compulsory subject, and students were to be self-governing.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of its completion, the Post Office Building {{contained}} the largest uninterrupted enclosed space in the city. Its clock tower reached [...] into the air. It was also the city's first building to have a steel frame structure, and the first to be built with electrical wiring incorporated into its design. The structure featured elevators with cages of highly intricate wrought iron, a glass covered atrium and mezzanine level, and floors, moldings, railings, and wainscoting made of marble. The atrium was [...] high, and 10 floors of balconies looked out onto the space (which provided interior light in an era when indoor lighting was not common). It boasted more than 39,000 interior electric lights, and its own electrical generator. Girders and catwalks spanned the atrium at the third floor level to allow post office supervisors to look down on the workers. The fifth floor housed executive offices in the corners. Each office had a turret, ornately carved wooden moldings, and red oak paneling. But there were problems with the structure. The Washington Star newspaper reported that the skylights and windows leaked air and water, the marble floors were poorly laid, and much of the construction was shoddy. The ninth floor was to have served as a file room, but a post-construction inspection showed it could not accommodate the weight. Technological advances in electricity and electrical wiring, mechanical engineering, movement of <b>air,</b> <b>heating,</b> and more made the building out of date as soon as it opened.|$|E

40|$|If a {{building}} is heated by a heat pump, {{it is of}} high importance that the heat pump has a high coefficient of performance. An exhaust <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> pump extracts heat from the building’s exhaust air.

This thesis examines whether it is profitable to complement an exhaust ventilation system with an exhaust <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> pump in an apartment block that already has geothermal heat pump, district heating, oil- or biofuel heated system. To determinate the profitability, a reference building in Strömstad has been used and was considered a representative of Sweden’s other apartment blocks.
