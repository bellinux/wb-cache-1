5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} areas of interpretation of John is its sacramental theology. Scholars' views have fallen along a wide spectrum ranging from anti-sacramental and non-sacramental, to sacramental, to ultra-sacramental and hyper-sacramental. Scholars disagree both on whether and how frequently John refers to the sacraments <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>and</b> {{on the degree of}} importance he places upon them. Individual scholars' answers to one of these questions do not always correspond to their answer to the other.|$|E

5|$|Bronchial {{injuries}} {{are divided into}} those that are accompanied by a disruption of the pleura {{and those that are}} not; in the former, air can leak from the hole in the airway and a pneumothorax can form.

5|$|Establishment {{and support}} of cadet battalions and rifle clubs, with the caveat that no funding could be {{provided}} out of the Parliamentary grant in respect of any person {{under the age of}} sixteen. This caveat was a compromise introduced on the third reading of the bill; the Commons had provided that no support could be given for a person under sixteen <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>and</b> the Lords wished to remove this restriction. The compromise was to state that no support could come from Parliamentary funds, but the associations were effectively free to raise money themselves for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|In {{his report}} to the War Office on the battle, Murray passed lightly over the part played by the Anzac Mounted Division. The {{majority}} of awards for the Battle of Romani went to British troops, including a generous number to officers of Murray's staff. Lawrence was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, but Chauvel, having already been made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George for South Africa and Companion of the Order of the Bath for Gallipoli, was recommended for a lesser award, which he refused. In view of this, Murray decided that Chauvel should receive no award <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>and</b> he was merely mentioned in despatches.|$|E

5|$|In {{the more}} popular {{versions}} of the tale, only one pea is used. However, Charles Boner added in two more peas in his translation of the story upon which Andersen based his tale. Other differences amongst versions {{can be seen in}} various numbers of mattresses as well as feather beds. Versions of the story differ based on whether or not the character of the helper is included. The helper, in some cases, tells the princess to pretend as though she slept badly. In other versions, the helper does not appear <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>and</b> the princess decides to lie all on her own.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April 1809, {{about three}} months before the family's move to Chawton, Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby, {{offering}} him a new manuscript of Susan if needed to secure the immediate publication of the novel, and requesting the return of the original so she could find another publisher. Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>and</b> that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the £10 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did not have the resources to buy the copyright back at that time, but was able to purchase it in 1816.|$|E

5|$|Seymour's {{operatives}} sought Johnson's support, but he long {{remained silent}} on the presidential campaign. It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>and</b> he never endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, {{in part because of}} their animus from the Stanton affair. In his annual message to Congress in December, Johnson urged the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, all would have been well. He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children, though not including those of President-elect Grant, who did not allow his to go.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they were}} named, the {{proteins}} {{have been found}} to be differentially expressed in other glands that secrete products directly into the external environment. These include lacrimal, parotid, submaxillary, sublingual, preputial and mammary glands. In some species, such as cats and pigs, Mups appear not to be expressed in urine <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>and</b> are mainly found in saliva. Sometimes the term urinary Mups (uMups) is used to distinguish those Mups expressed in urine from those in other tissues.|$|E

In the Adhyatma Ramayana, Kabandha appears from the pyre as a divine being and reveals his true {{identity}} as a cursed gandharva. He further extols Rama in a hymn stating that various worlds and deities are embedded in parts of his body and Rama is the Supreme being and then disappears.|$|E

5|$|The {{complete}} set of observable traits {{that make up the}} structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment. As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in genotypic variation; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of albinism, who do not tan <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>and</b> are very sensitive to sunburn.|$|E
5|$|The scandalous trick and {{the frank}} {{language}} have {{for much of}} the play's history kept it off the stage and out of print. Between 1753 and 1924, The Country Wife was considered too outrageous to be performed <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>and</b> was replaced on the stage by David Garrick's cleaned-up and bland version The Country Girl, now a forgotten curiosity. The original play is again a stage favourite today, and is also acclaimed by academic critics, who praise its linguistic energy, sharp social satire, and openness to different interpretations.|$|E
5|$|There {{are mainly}} {{three types of}} camera systems. In fixed camera systems, the camera does not move <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>and</b> the system {{displays}} the player's character in a succession of still shots. Tracking cameras, on the other hand, follow the character's movements. Finally, interactive camera systems are partially automated and allow the player to directly change the view. To implement camera systems, video game developers use techniques such as constraint solvers, artificial intelligence scripts, or autonomous agents.|$|E

5|$|West Germans {{were able}} {{to cross the border}} {{relatively}} freely to visit relatives, but had to go through numerous bureaucratic formalities. East Germans were subjected to far stricter restrictions. It was not until November 1964 that they were allowed to visit the West <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>and</b> even then only pensioners were allowed. This gave rise to a joke that only in East Germany did people look forward to old age. Younger East Germans were not allowed to travel to the West until 1972, though few did so until the mid-1980s. They had to apply for an exit visa and passport, pay a substantial fee, obtain permission from their employer and undergo an interrogation from the police.|$|E
5|$|As Ada reached North Queensland, the BoM issued cyclone {{warnings}} on {{a three-hour}} cycle, with more frequent bulletins occasionally released as needed. Flood warnings were issued for watersheds of susceptible rivers like the Pioneer and Connors. The bureau's post-storm {{assessment of the}} disaster revealed that local broadcasts of advisories were sometimes delayed by several hours or not made <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>and</b> public awareness was generally inadequate. In a misguided attempt to quell panic, one radio station appended the BoM's warning with an unapproved message {{that there was no}} cause for alarm because of the cyclone's small size. Due to the unusual nature of the storm, including its delayed arrival in some areas, many residents criticised or disregarded forecasts. Additionally, many tourists in the region were unfamiliar with the dangers of tropical cyclones. Findings from studies of the public response to Ada were used as the basis for upgraded warning systems and the introduction of more cyclone education campaigns; these initiatives were credited with saving lives and property in later storms such as Cyclone Althea in December 1971.|$|E
5|$|Behind Royal Sovereign was Marlborough, {{inextricably}} {{tangled with}} Impétueux. Badly damaged {{and on the}} verge of surrender, Impétueux was briefly reprieved when Mucius appeared through the smoke and collided with both ships. The three entangled ships continued exchanging fire for some time, all suffering heavy casualties with Marlborough and Impétueux losing all three of their masts. This combat continued for several hours. Captain Berkeley of Marlborough had to retire below with serious wounds, and command fell to Lieutenant John Monkton, who signalled for help from the frigates in reserve. Robert Stopford responded in HMS Aquilon, which had the assignment of repeating signals, and towed Marlborough out of the line as Mucius freed herself and made for the regrouped French fleet to the north. Impétueux was in too damaged a state to move <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>and</b> was soon seized by sailors from HMS Russell.|$|E
