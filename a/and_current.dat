50|$|As DESRON 11 {{began their}} {{exercise}} {{run down the}} California coast, {{they made their way}} through these swells <b>and</b> <b>currents.</b> While the squadron was traveling through these swells <b>and</b> <b>currents,</b> their estimations of speed and bearing used for dead reckoning were being affected. The navigators aboard the lead ship USS Delphy did {{not take into account the}} effects of the strong <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> large swells in their estimations. Since the navigators in the lead ship USS Delphy did not account for the <b>current</b> <b>and</b> swells in their estimations, the entire squadron was off course and positioned near the treacherous coastline of Honda Point instead of the open ocean of the Santa Barbara Channel. Coupled with darkness and thick fog, the swells <b>and</b> <b>currents</b> caused by the earthquake in Japan made accurate navigation nearly impossible for the USS Delphy. The geography of Honda Point, which is completely exposed to wind and waves, created an extremely deadly environment once the unusually strong swells <b>and</b> <b>currents</b> were added to the coastline.|$|R
