25|$|The 1998 model {{had a few}} minor {{refinement}} {{changes to}} the brakes, suspension, steering and emissions controls. A new front control arm design with front hydraulic bushing and rear cross axis ball joint for enhanced ride smoothness and better isolation from road noise and vibration. Internal rebound springs added to front struts for improved body motion control and to minimize crash-through. Increased wheel travel (3mm) and redesigned jounce bumpers for softer feel <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>travel.</b> Dual durometer cradle mounts for improved isolation. Premium valving and damping {{in the front and}} rear struts for a higher refinement in calibration. There were more accurate wheel sensors for improved ABS actuation. New steering calibration for more on-center feel and reduced parking effort.|$|E

40|$|Consider a {{transport}} {{facility in}} steady {{state that is}} operating at maximum throughput. How does it respond to a once-and-for-all increase in demand? The trip price must increase to ration the increased demand, but how? These questions {{have been the subject}} of a debate in transport economic theory dating back to Walters' classic paper (1961). The current wisdom is that the facility continues to operate <b>at</b> <b>full</b> capacity, with <b>travel</b> <b>at</b> reduced velocity and/or increased queuing serving to increase the trip price.
