25|$|The two RUC {{officers}} were travelling without escort in Buchanan's personal unmarked car: a red Vauxhall Cavalier with {{the registration number}} KIB 1204 which was not armoured-plated and didn't have bullet-proof glass. Buchanan had used this same car on all of his previous visits to Dundalk and other locations in the Republic of Ireland. Both {{officers were}} unarmed, as it was illegal to transport weapons into the Republic of Ireland, {{and they were in}} plain clothes. Buchanan drove away from the Dundalk Garda station after the meeting had ended at about 3.15 p.m. <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> main Dublin-Belfast road onto the Edenappa Road which is a minor rural road which passes through the village of Jonesborough. Buchanan was known by the British Army to regularly take this route when going to or from Dundalk Garda station.|$|E
500|$|Timoshenko {{was rushed}} to Kings County Hospital Center once medical {{personnel}} arrived at the scene. Each of the two bullets that struck Timoshenko cut across his spinal cord, just beneath his brain, which left him unable to breathe on his own or to move his muscles. [...] According to doctors, he had no oxygen for 15 to 20 minutes after he was shot because of his initial paralysis. The loss of oxygen left him in a coma since the shooting, so he was placed on life support machines {{that allowed him to}} breathe. Tests conducted on July 14 determined that he had no brain activity (matching the definition of legal death in the state of New York); as a result, the doctors pronounced him dead at 4:14 p.m. <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> artificial respirator. He was 23 {{years old at the time}} of his death.|$|E

60|$|Vera was {{standing}} behind the unclosed door of her room. She heard the sneck of his lock. She heard the water still running in the bathroom, trickling with the mysterious sound of water at dead of night. Screwing up her courage, she went <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> tap. Then she stood again in her own room, to be near the companionable breathing of her sleeping sister, listening. Siegmund undressed quickly. His one thought was to get into bed.|$|E
60|$|At this point, by {{a simple}} {{association}} of ideas, Mr Verloc was brought {{face to face with}} the necessity of going to bed some time or other that evening. Then why not go nowâ€”at once?

He dreaded the demon of sleeplessness, which he felt had marked him for its own. He raised his arm, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> flaring gas-jet above his head.|$|E

60|$|But, as upon further consideration, I {{imagined}} that the peeress might decline the honor of my company, since I had no formal card of introduction; I marched on, and rejoined my companion, whom I at once endeavored to draw out, touching Lord Lovely; but he only made mysterious answers; <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> conversation, by allusions to his visits to Ickworth in Suffolk, the magnificent seat of the Most Noble Marquis of Bristol, who had repeatedly assured Harry that he might consider Ickworth his home.|$|E

Copple left several pounds of salt in these spots. R.C. and I {{went up to the}} upper end where he had seen deer before. No deer this day! But saw three turkeys, one an old gobbler. We lost sight of them.|$|E
6000|$|The {{moment the}} call was given, Bob Clazie, having {{received}} no telegraphic [...] "stop," [...] had at once run to ring up the men, who, like Dashwood, had been sleeping close at hand. He rang up {{the driver of the}} engine first. At the same moment his comrade on duty had run round to the stable, where the horses stood ready harnessed, and brought them out. Thus the thing was done without a moment's delay. The driver, when roused, flung on his coat and helmet, and ran to the engine. It was a steam fire-engine; that is, the pumps were worked by steam instead of by hand. The firing was ready laid, and the water kept nearly at the boiling point by means of a jet of gas. He had scarcely applied a light to the fire <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> gas, when four comrades ran into the shed, seized the red-painted engine, and dragged her out, as we have seen.|$|E

They {{went away}} at seven, and Lord Treasurer and I sat talking an hour after. After dinner {{he was talking to}} the lords about the speech the Queen must make when the Parliament meets. He asked me how I would make it. I was going to be serious, because it was seriously put; but I turned it to a jest. And because they had been speaking of the Duchess of Marlborough going to Flanders after the Duke, I said the speech should begin thus: [...] "My Lords and Gentlemen, In order to my own quiet, and that of my subjects, I have thought fit to send the Duchess of Marlborough abroad after the Duke." [...] This took well, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> discourse. I must tell you I do not at all like the present situation of affairs, and remember I tell you so.

6000|$|The saint {{acted with}} the concubinarians almost {{in the same}} manner as our Saviour dealt with the publicans and harlots. Far from {{treating}} them severely, the deeper they were plunged in that darling vice, the more tenderly he seemed to use them. On all occasions he declared himself their friend; he made them frequent visits, without fear of being upbraided with so infamous a conversation. He invited himself sometimes to eat with them; and then, assuming an air of gaiety, he desired the master to bring down the children to bear him company. When he had a little commended their prettiness, he asked to see their mother, and shewed her the same countenance, as if he had taken her for an honest woman. If she were beautiful or well shaped, he praised her, and said [...] "she looked like a Portuguese:" [...] after which; in private conversation, [...] "you have," [...] said he to her master, [...] "a fair slave, who well deserves to be your wife." [...] But if she were a swarthy, ugly Indian, [...] "Good God!" [...] he cried out, [...] "what a monster do you keep within your doors! and how are you able to endure the sight of her?" [...] Such words, spoken in all appearance without design, had commonly their full effect: the keeper married her whom the saint had commended, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> others.|$|E
6000|$|That burglar-alarm which Susy {{mentions}} led a gay and careless life, {{and had no}} principles. It {{was generally}} out of order {{at one point or}} another; and there was plenty of opportunity, because all the windows and doors in the house, from the cellar up to the top floor, were connected with it. However, in its seasons of being out of order it could trouble us for only a very little while: we quickly found out that it was fooling us, and that it was buzzing its blood-curdling alarm merely for its own amusement. Then we would shut it off, and send to New York for the electrician--there not being one in all Hartford in those days. When the repairs were finished we would set the alarm again and reestablish our confidence in it. It never did any real business except upon one single occasion. All the rest of its expensive career was frivolous and without purpose. Just that one time it performed its duty, and its whole duty--gravely, seriously, admirably. It let fly about two o'clock one black and dreary March morning, and I turned out promptly, because I knew that it was not fooling, this time. The bath-room door was on my side of the bed. I stepped in there, turned up the gas, looked at the annunciator, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> alarm--so far as the door indicated was concerned--thus stopping the racket. Then I came back to bed. Mrs. Clemens opened the debate: ...|$|E

6000|$|On {{the left}} wing of the horse Virgil appeared, in shining armour, {{completely}} fitted to his body; he was mounted on a dapple-grey steed, the slowness of whose pace was an effect of the highest mettle and vigour. He cast {{his eye on the}} adverse wing, with a desire to find an object worthy of his valour, when behold upon a sorrel gelding of a monstrous size appeared a foe, issuing from among the thickest of the enemy's squadrons; but his speed was less than his noise; for his horse, old and lean, spent the dregs of his strength in a high trot, which, though it made slow advances, yet caused a loud clashing of his armour, terrible to hear. The two cavaliers had now approached within the throw of a lance, when the stranger desired a parley, and, lifting up the visor of his helmet, a face hardly appeared from within which, after a pause, was known for that of the renowned Dryden. The brave Ancient suddenly started, as one possessed with surprise and disappointment together; for the helmet was nine times too large for the head, which appeared situate far in the hinder part, even like the lady in a lobster, or like a mouse under a canopy of state, or like a shrivelled beau from within the penthouse of a modern periwig; and the voice was suited to the visage, sounding weak and remote. Dryden, in a long harangue, soothed up the good Ancient; called him father, and, by a large deduction of genealogies, made it plainly appear that they were nearly related. Then he humbly proposed an exchange of armour, as a lasting mark of hospitality between them. Virgil consented (for the goddess Diffidence came unseen, and cast a mist before his eyes), though his was of gold and cost a hundred beeves, the other's but of rusty iron. However, this glittering armour became the Modern yet worsen than his own. Then they agreed to exchange horses; but, {{when it came to the}} trial, Dryden was afraid and utterly unable to mount. [...] . Alter hiatus [...] . in MS. Lucan appeared upon a fiery horse of admirable shape, but headstrong, bearing the rider where he list over the field; he made a mighty slaughter among the enemy's horse; which destruction to stop, Blackmore, a famous Modern (but one of the mercenaries), strenuously opposed himself, and darted his javelin with a strong hand, which, falling short of its mark, struck deep in the earth. Then Lucan threw a lance; but AEsculapius came unseen <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> point. [...] "Brave Modern," [...] said Lucan, [...] "I perceive some god protects you, for never did my arm so deceive me before: but what mortal can contend with a god? Therefore, let us fight no longer, but present gifts to each other." [...] Lucan then bestowed on the Modern a pair of spurs, and Blackmore gave Lucan a bridle. [...] . Pauca desunt. [...] . [...] . Creech: but the goddess Dulness took a cloud, formed into the shape of Horace, armed and mounted, and placed in a flying posture before him.
