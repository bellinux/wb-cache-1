40|$|<b>Aleutian</b> mink <b>disease</b> (AD) {{has been}} {{characterized}} by immune complex glomerulonephritis associated with persistent infection of <b>Aleutian</b> mink <b>disease</b> parvovirus (ADV). Histopathological examination of kidneys from ADV-infected mink in this study revealed that interstitial nephritis characterized by prominent damage of renal tubuli and lymphocyte infiltration was also common in AD along with glomerulonephritis. By using strand-specific in situ molecular hybridization technique, replication of ADV was observed in tubular epithelial cells, in addition to epithelial cells of Bowman's capsules and some glomerular cells of the infected mink. Analysis of tubular lesions {{by a combination of}} immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed that the renal tubuli positive for virion DNA or replicative form DNA/mRNA of ADV were also positive for an activation marker of immunocompetent cells, which is shared by B lymphocytes and thymic epithelial cells. Infiltration of a subpopulation of T lymphocytes around infected renal tubuli were observed but deposition of immune complexes in these tubular lesions was not demonstrable.

50|$|<b>Aleutian</b> <b>disease</b> virus (ADV) is a {{parvovirus}} discovered among mink in the Aleutian Islands in {{the early}} 20th century. In ferrets, the virus affects the immune system (causing it to produce non-neutralizing antibodies) and many internal organs, particularly the kidneys. There is no cure or vaccine for the disease, and ferrets may carry the virus for months or years without any signs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aleutian</b> <b>Disease</b> {{was first}} {{recognized}} in ranch-raised mink in 1956. The disease was {{so named because}} it was first found in mink with the Aleutian coat color gene, a gun-metal grey pelt.

50|$|<b>Aleutian</b> <b>disease,</b> {{also known}} as mink plasmacytosis, is a disease which causes {{spontaneous}} abortion and death in minks and ferrets. It is caused by Carnivore amdoparvovirus 1 ({{also known as}} Aleution diease virus, ADV), a highly contagious parvovirus in the genus Amdoparvovirus.The virus has been found as a natural infection in the Mustelidae family within mink, ferrets, otters, polecats, stone and pine martens and within other varying carnivores such as skunks, genets, foxes and raccoons. This is most commonly explained as because they all share resources and habitats.|$|E

50|$|A lethal {{infection}} in mink, the <b>Aleutian</b> <b>disease</b> virus lies dormant in ferrets until stress or injury {{allows it to}} surface. While the parvovirus itself causes little or no harm to the ferret host, {{the large number of}} antibodies produced in response to the presence of the virus results in a systemic vasculitis, resulting in eventual renal failure, bone marrow suppression and death.The symptoms are chronic, progressive weight loss, lethargy, splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), anemia, rear leg weakness, seizures and black tarry stool. Additional symptoms include poor reproduction and/or oral bleeding/gastrointestinal bleeding. Lesions can also be found within the pelt depending on the severity of the disease. This virus can unfortunately reduce fitness of wild mink especially, by disturbing both the productivity within adult females and the overall survivor rates of both juveniles and adults. Likewise, in the mink kits that survive, it infects the alveolar cells and ultimately causes respiratory distress, possibly leading to death.|$|E

40|$|<b>Aleutian</b> mink <b>disease</b> is {{generally}} considered to precipitate spontaneously in ranch mink, with a lethal outcome. A two-year field study of a herd of susceptible mutant mink (sapphires and violets), however, has shown that all individual mink were affected from birth; the well state consisted of periodic low-level hypergamma-globulinemia accompanied by minute vascular occlusions. The spontaneous lethal change in an individual appeared to arise during one of these hypergammaglobu-linemic episodes and thus represented {{a failure of the}} immune system to control an inherent virus-induced mononucleosis. The fact that the entire herd was affected by the periodic form from birth is considered strong evidence for vertical trans-mission at a rate of 100 %. The incidence of spontaneous precipitation was found to be dependent on the level of hypergammaglobulinemia in the mother during pregnancy. <b>Aleutian</b> mink <b>disease</b> (AMD) occurs in mink as a spontaneous degeneration with autoimmune disease-type nephritis, generalized plasmacytosis, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and hypergam-maglobulinemia [1, 2].

40|$|We {{characterized}} {{a strain}} of <b>Aleutian</b> <b>disease</b> virus adapted to growth in Crandall feline kidney cells at 31. 8 degrees C. When purified from infected cells, <b>Aleutian</b> <b>disease</b> virus had a density in CsCl of 1. 42 to 1. 44 g/ml and was 24 to 26 nm in diameter.

In alkaline sucrose gradients, <b>Aleutian</b> <b>disease</b> virus DNA was a single species that cosedimented at 15. 5 S with single-stranded DNA from adeno-associated virus. When the DNA was analyzed on neutral sucrose gradients, a single species was again observed, which sedimented at 21 S and was clearly distinct from 16 S duplex adeno-associated virus DNA. A similar result was obtained even after incubation under annealing conditions, implying that the bulk of <b>Aleutian</b> <b>disease</b> virus virions contained a single non-complementary strand with a molecular weight of about 1. 4 X 10 (6). In addition, two major virus-associated polypeptides with molecular weights of 89, 100 and 77, 600 were demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of virus purified from infected cultures labeled with [35 S]methionine.

40|$|Tissues from mink {{infected}} with <b>aleutian</b> <b>disease</b> virus were {{examined by the}} electron microscope {{for the presence of}} virus particles. Virus-like particles, measuring 22 nm in diameter, were observed in macrophages of spleen, mesenteric lymph node and in Kupffer cells in liver of mink ten to 13 days after infection. The virus-like particles were usually present in vacuoles inside the cytoplasm of macrophages and Kupffer cells and, occasionally, similar particles were observed inside the nucleus. Cells from uninfected mink did not contain such patricles. To correlate the existence of these virus-like particles with the presence of <b>aleutian</b> <b>disease</b> virus antigen in infected cells, tissues were processed for immunoferritin technique. It was found that <b>aleutian</b> <b>disease</b> virus antigen was present in vacuoles inside the cytoplasm of cells from the infected spleen, lymph node and liver, and that the location was {{similar to that of the}} 22 nm virus-like particles. In addition, some viral antigen was also detected as cytoplasmic granular material. The nuclei of some cells also contained <b>aleutian</b> <b>disease</b> virus antigen.

40|$|Information was {{sought on}} the {{comparative}} pathogenicity of four North American strains (isolates) of <b>Aleutian</b> <b>disease</b> virus for royal pastel (a non-Aleutian genotype) and sapphire (an Aleutian genotype) mink. The four strains (Utah- 1, Ontario [Canada], Montana, and Pullman [Washington]), all of mink origin, were inoculated intraperitoneally and intranasally in serial 10 -fold dilutions. As {{indicated by the}} appearance of specific antibody (counterimmunoelectrophoresis test), all strains readily infected both color phases of mink, and all strains were equally pathogenic for sapphire mink. Not all strains, however, regularly caused <b>Aleutian</b> <b>disease</b> in pastel mink. Infection of pastel mink with the Utah- 1 strain invariably led to fatal disease. Infection with the Ontario strain caused fatal disease nearly as often. The Pullman strain, by contrast, almost never caused disease in infected pastel mink. The pathogenicity of the Montana strain for this color phase was between these extremes. These findings emphasize the need to distinguish between infection and disease when mink are exposed to <b>Aleutian</b> <b>disease</b> virus.

The high level of AMDV-infected mink in Colchester and Halifax counties may pose a serious threat to the captive mink and wild animal populations.

Mink were raised under farm conditions in the Intermountain West in North America, except for 1 submission of mink from Wisconsin. In the 339 mink where cause(s) of death were established, 311 (91. 7 %) died from a single disease or condition, whereas 28 (8. 3 %) had 2 diseases or conditions contributing to death. Where cause(s) of death were evident, 11 diseases accounted for 321 (94. 7 %) of the diagnoses: bacterial pneumonia (67, 18. 8 %), <b>Aleutian</b> mink <b>disease</b> (61, 17. 7 %), mink viral enteritis (56, 16. 2 %), hepatic lipidosis (28, 8. 1 %), nutritional myopathy (24, 7 %), bacterial enterocolitis (17, 4. 9 %), bacterial septicemia (16, 4. 6 %), starvation (15, 4. 3 %), epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis of mink (14, 4. 1 %), pancreatitis (13, 3. 8 %), and bacterial metritis (10, 2. 9 %).

40|$|The {{contributions}} to <b>Aleutian</b> <b>disease</b> gammopathy of specific antiviral antibody and an autoimmune component, anti-DNA antibody, were studied with pastel ranch mink naturally infected with <b>Aleutian</b> <b>disease</b> virus. Specific antibody activities {{were determined by}} countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis and radioimmune assay, respectively. Gamma globulin levels (percent gamma) were determined by serum electrophoresis. Within an infected mink population, {{it was possible to}} predict the level of gammopathy from measurement of the two antibody levels. For the mink serum samples used, there was better correlation between anti-DNA antibody levels and total serum immunoglobulin than between anti-Aleutian disease virus antibody titers and percent gamma. With serum samples taken over a 2 -week interval, significant increases were measured in anti-DNA antibody and percent gamma. Increases in anti-Aleutian disease virus titers during this period were not significant. The results suggest that the continuing increases in serum immunoglobulin in <b>Aleutian</b> <b>disease</b> virus-infected mink are due to both a specific antiviral response and an autoimmune response, as reflected in generation of anti-DNA antibody...|$|E
