Simultaneous examination of 522 individuals older than 18 years was performed. Along with standard procedures provided by the prophylactic medical examination program synchronous registration of blood pressure (BP) on four extremities by MCVS was performed. At that a difference in systolic BP between arms (ΔSBParm) and legs (ΔSBPleg) and ankle-brachial index (ABI) were <b>automatically</b> <b>calculated.</b> <b>Values</b> of │ΔSBParm│ or │ΔSBPleg│≥ 15 mm Hg or ABI≤ 0. 9 were considered as markers of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Results. Signs of peripheral arterial atherosclerotic lesions among patients ≥ 40 years old were found in 14. 7 % of the cases (95 % confidence interval [CI] 11. 7 - 18. 4). Relative risks of atherosclerotic lesions in arteries increase 1. 71 -fold (95 % CI 1. 06 - 2. 74) in arterial hypertension, 1. 70 -fold (95 % CI 1. 08 - 2. 68) – in obesity, 1. 91 fold (95 % CI 1. 17 - 3. 12) – in diabetes, {{as well as with}} the increasing levels of cardiovascular risk.

In the present study, we propose a multicriteria sorting method for classifying the cardiac beats as ischemic or not.

This study aimed to determine whether emphysema detected upon computed tomography (CT) screening would accelerate the rate of lung function decline and influence the possibility of future development of airflow limitation in a population without spirometric abnormalities. Materials and methods: Subjects who participated in a routine screening for health checkup and follow-up pulmonary function tests for at least 3  years between 2004 and 2010 were retrospectively enrolled. The percentage of low-attenuation area below − 950 Hounsfield units (%LAA− 950) was <b>calculated</b> <b>automatically.</b> A <b>calculated</b> <b>value</b> of %LAA− 950 that exceeded 10 % was defined as emphysema. Adjusted annual lung function decline was analyzed using random-slope, random-intercept mixed linear regression models. Results: A total of 628 healthy subjects within the normal range of spriometric values were included. Multivariable analysis showed that the emphysema group exhibited a faster decline in forced vital capacity (− 33. 9 versus − 18. 8  mL/year; P= 0. 02). Emphysema was not associated with the development of airflow limitation during follow-up. Conclusion: Incidental emphysema quantified using CT scan was significantly associated with a more rapid decline in forced vital capacity in the population with normative spirometric values. However, an association between emphysema and future development of airflow limitation was not observed.
