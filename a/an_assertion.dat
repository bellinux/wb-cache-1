5|$|The castles made a clear, {{imperial}} {{statement about}} Edward's intentions to rule North Wales {{on a permanent}} basis. As already noted, they were typically located on sites that had {{been associated with the}} former Welsh princes. Caernarfon, in particular, stands out for its use of banded, coloured stone in the walls, statues of eagles and its polygonal, rather than round, towers. There has been extensive academic debate over the interpretation of these features. Historian Arnold Taylor argued that the design of the castle was a representation of the Walls of Constantinople. The conscious use of imagery from the Byzantine Roman Empire was therefore <b>an</b> <b>assertion</b> of authority by EdwardI. Recent work by historian Abigail Wheatley suggests that the design of Caernarfon was indeed <b>an</b> <b>assertion</b> of Edward's authority, but that it drew on imagery from Roman sites in Britain with the intent of creating an allusion of Arthurian legitimacy for the king.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been {{described}} as being, in effect, <b>an</b> <b>assertion</b> of paramountcy by the Government of India over the states in a more pervasive form. While this contradicted the British statement that paramountcy would lapse on the transfer of power, the Congress position had always been that independent India would inherit the position of being the paramount power.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} statements that could have borne the name Ramanujan conjecture, there is one that was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of André Weil in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That Ramanujan conjecture is <b>an</b> <b>assertion</b> {{on the size of}} the tau-function, which has as generating function the discriminant modular form Δ(q), a typical cusp form in the theory of modular forms. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a Fields Medal in 1978 for that work.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, the PTC {{launched}} a campaign against the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), complaining that their SmackDown! program contained levels of sexuality and violence unbecoming prime time programming. In the campaign, Bozell said that four children {{had been killed by}} peers emulating professional wrestling moves learned from the program. With these allegations, Bozell and various PTC members began meeting with representatives of the advertising departments of various companies that advertised on SmackDown! to persuade them to withdraw sponsorship. The PTC also suggested that between 30 and 40 advertisers had pulled their commercials from WWF programming, <b>an</b> <b>assertion</b> that was not true.|$|E
5|$|Roger of Hoveden {{described}} Uhtred of Galloway as a consanguinus ("cousin") of King Henry II of England, <b>an</b> <b>assertion</b> {{that has}} given rise to the theory that, since Gille-Brighde is never described as such, they must have been from different mothers. Fergus must therefore, according to the theory, have had two wives, one of whom was a bastard daughter of Henry I; that is, Uhtred and his descendants were related to the English royal family, while Gille-Brighde and his descendants were not. According to historian G.W.S. Barrow, the theory is disproved by one English royal document, written in the name of King John of England, which likewise asserts that Donnchadh was John's cousin.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} when Æthelberht became a Christian. It is possible, despite Bede's account, that he already was a Christian before Augustine's mission arrived. It is likely that Liudhard and Bertha pressed Æthelberht to {{consider}} becoming a Christian {{before the arrival of}} the mission, and it is also likely that a condition of Æthelberht's marriage to Bertha was that Æthelberht would consider conversion. Conversion via the influence of the Frankish court would have been seen as an explicit recognition of Frankish overlordship, however, so it is possible that Æthelberht's delay of his conversion until it could be accomplished via Roman influence, might have been <b>an</b> <b>assertion</b> of independence from Frankish control. It also has been argued that Augustine's hesitation—he turned back to Rome, asking to be released from the mission—is an indication that Æthelberht was a pagan at the time Augustine was sent.|$|E

5|$|Even {{after the}} {{election}} of Abraham Lincoln as president in 1860, Crittenden rejected the idea that secession was inevitable and continued {{to work for the}} preservation of the Union. He believed that the current sectional crisis could—like all past disagreements in U.S. history—be resolved through compromise. However, he believed that this compromise must not be a simple legislative action, which could be altered or even repealed by a successive Congress, but amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which would be much more difficult to change. To that end, he proposed the Crittenden Compromise—a package of six constitutional amendments and four congressional resolutions—in December 1860. Among the resolutions were a condemnation of Northern personal liberty laws and <b>an</b> <b>assertion</b> of the constitutionality of the fugitive slave law. The amendments would have restored the Missouri Compromise line and extended it to California as a line of demarcation between slave and free territories. Crittenden's other amendments would have further guaranteed that slavery would remain legal indefinitely in Washington, D.C., so long as it was legal in either Maryland or Virginia and that slaveholders would be reimbursed for runaway slaves. Also, the amendments denied Congress any power to interfere with the interstate slave trade or with slavery in the existing Southern states and made the fugitive slave law and Three-Fifths Compromise perpetual in duration.|$|E
25|$|Simple {{grammatical}} {{negation of}} a clause in principle {{has the effect}} of converting a proposition to its logical negation – replacing <b>an</b> <b>assertion</b> that something is the case by <b>an</b> <b>assertion</b> {{that it is not the}} case.|$|E

25|$|The moral philosopher Peter Singer, {{along with}} Kenneth Roth, has cited Israel's {{prosecution}} of Adolf Eichmann in 1961 as <b>an</b> <b>assertion</b> of universal jurisdiction. He claims that while Israel did invoke a statute specific to Nazi crimes against Jews, its Supreme Court claimed universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity.|$|E
25|$|Newtonian {{mechanics}} {{added to}} the special principle several other concepts, including laws of motion, gravitation, and <b>an</b> <b>assertion</b> of an absolute time. When formulated {{in the context of}} these laws, the special principle of relativity states that the laws of mechanics are invariant under a Galilean transformation.|$|E

25|$|Aside from {{occasional}} {{defenders of}} his anti-Communist and socially conservative views, defence of the Duplessis government today comes primarily from traditionalist conservatives (paleoconservatives in North American definition) who view his regime {{as an essential}} reaffirmation of traditional values, and as <b>an</b> <b>assertion</b> by democratic means of the basics of church and family life with low social spending and suppression of labour unions.|$|E
25|$|As {{many modern}} thinkers will, Plato ascribes relativism to Protagoras and uses his predecessor's teachings as a foil {{for his own}} {{commitment}} to objective and transcendent realities and values.

25|$|Some {{accounts}} {{use this}} response to rebut {{claims that the}} theory of evolution is not falsifiable by any empirical evidence. This followed <b>an</b> <b>assertion</b> by philosopher, Karl Popper, who had proposed that falsifiability is an essential feature of a scientific theory. Popper also expressed doubts about the scientific status of evolutionary theory, although he later concluded that the field of study was genuinely scientific.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Ripley refused {{to authorize the}} {{purchase}} of additional stocks of rifle-muskets for infantry use.

He also adamantly opposed the introduction of breech-loading repeating rifles, on the basis that they would encourage poor fire discipline and waste ammunition.|$|E

In these hymns, the Vedic mythology asserts that Vishnu resides in that highest home where departed Atman (souls) reside, <b>an</b> <b>assertion</b> {{that may have}} been the reason for his increasing emphasis and popularity in Hindu soteriology. He is also described in the Vedic literature as the one who supports heaven and earth.|$|E
