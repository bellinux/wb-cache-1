Churches of Christ have historically practiced a cappella music in worship services.|$|E
5|$|It {{was founded}} in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics taught that {{emotions}} resulted in errors of judgment which were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy {{as a way of}} life (lex divina), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to {{the project}} was based on three {{separate}} objections to its construction: ecological, human, and financial. Conservation groups opposed the dam's construction because it would flood the Yukon Flats, a large wetland area that provides breeding ground for millions of waterfowl and habitat for game and fur-bearing animals. Alaska Native groups objected {{to the project}}'s human cost—the need to relocate more than 1,500 people and 9 villages—and Native groups outside the reservoir area objected to the potential devastation of the Yukon River salmon population. The third objection to construction of the dam stemmed from its high cost <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> cheap electricity {{would not be enough}} to attract industry to Alaska.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} {{half of the}} Song dynasty (960–1279), the study of {{archaeology}} developed out of the antiquarian interests of the educated gentry and their desire to revive the use of ancient vessels in state rituals and ceremonies. This <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> ancient vessels were products of 'sages' and not common people was criticized by Shen Kuo, who discussed metallurgy, optics, astronomy, geometry, and ancient music measures in addition to archeology. His contemporary Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze. In accordance with the beliefs of the later Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), some Song gentry —such as Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129)— valued archaeological evidence over historical works written after the fact, finding written records unreliable when they failed to match with the archaeological discoveries. Hong Mai (1123–1202) used ancient Han dynasty era vessels to debunk what he found to be fallacious descriptions of Han vessels in the Bogutu archaeological catalogue compiled during {{the latter half of}} Huizong's reign (1100–1125).|$|E
5|$|Having {{identified}} the culprit as Adachi, the party chases and locates him within the TV world. Adachi explains that his actions {{were out of}} both boredom <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> humanity is better off believing what it wants; his claims are dismissed by the party as the rantings of a madman. After fighting Adachi, he is possessed by Ameno-sagiri, the Japanese God of Fog, who reveals that the fog is harmful to people and will eventually cause humanity to fall into a permanent state of ignorance and transform into Shadows. Upon his defeat, he agrees to lift the fog, congratulating the party on their resolve. Defeated, the wounded Adachi agrees to assume responsibility for his actions and turns himself in. The game moves {{forward to the day}} before the protagonist must travel home. If the player returns to the Dojima residence, the game ends with the party sending the protagonist off as he departs Inaba. Alternatively, should the player be able to identify the unexplained cause of the Midnight Channel and attempt to resolve this plot element, the protagonist meets with the party, and together they decide to end the case for good.|$|E

25|$|The Mishneh Torah was {{strongly}} opposed {{almost as soon}} as it appeared. Major sources of contention were the absence of sources <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the work appeared to be intended to supersede study of the Talmud. Some criticisms appear to have been less rational in nature. Indeed, Maimonides quotes the Talmud in stating that one should study the Talmud for a third of one's study time.|$|E
25|$|Documentary evidence, such as {{newspaper}} articles and reports to parliamentary committees, suggest {{a range of}} rationales.

25|$|In Armenia, {{celebrations}} at the Presentation {{have been}} influenced by pre-Christian customs, such as: the spreading of ashes by farmers in their fields each year to ensure a better harvest, keeping ashes on the roof of a house to keep evil spirits away, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> newlywed women needed to jump over fire to purify themselves before getting pregnant.

25|$|Nithings {{were thought}} to be {{suffering}} of physical ailments and were associated with crippledness.

25|$|Conversely, the Cole report {{stated that}} Sydney {{may not have}} been at action stations: ship's logs for several Australian {{warships}} showed that it was not common practice to do so when approaching unidentified merchant vessels in home waters. This, combined with Detmers' observation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> Sydneys approach followed procedures for an 'innocent' instead of a 'suspicious' vessel, prompted Cole to conclude that the Australian cruiser was not at action stations.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} part of this century, {{professional}} education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine.
