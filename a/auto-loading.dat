5|$|A {{special edition}} of Wipeout 3 was {{released}} exclusively in Europe on 14 July 2000. Wipeout 3 Special Edition featured many minor changes to gameplay, such as different craft physics, <b>auto-loading</b> of saves and AI bugfixes. In addition, eight courses from previous Wipeout titles (three from Wipeout and five from Wipeout 2097) plus two hidden prototype circuits previously only available in the Japanese version of Wipeout 3, were added giving total of 22 tracks. Special Edition also allowed for four-person multiplayer, using two televisions and two PlayStation consoles. Wipeout 3 was the last game in the series made for the PlayStation. The next entry in the Wipeout series, entitled Wipeout Fusion, was released in 2002 exclusively for the PlayStation 2. The game introduced new tracks, ships, and weaponry, as well as enhanced artificial intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Grinders have {{increased}} in size and complexity with advances in time and technology. From {{the old days of}} a manual toolroom grinder sharpening endmills for a production shop, to today's 30000 RPM CNC <b>auto-loading</b> manufacturing cell producing jet turbines, grinding processes vary greatly.|$|E
25|$|T-72-120: KMDB main {{armament}} package first {{offered in}} 1999 with the T-72AG or -MP upgrades, which includes an auto-loaded KBM-2 120mm main gun, developed with the French-based GIAT Industries {{and capable of}} firing NATO-standard ammunition or ATGMs. This upgrade includes a new 2E42-M stabilizer and a new auto-loader system housed in the redesigned turret bustle and {{similar to that used}} in the Leclerc main battle tank with a capacity of 20 single fixed rounds and further 20 stored in the hull in place of the legacy AZ <b>auto-loading</b> mechanism. The high costs involved with such an extensive modification have thus far driven away potential buyers.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the 22 <b>auto-loaded</b> rounds, the T-72 carries 17 rounds conventionally in the hull, which can be loaded into the emptied autoloader trays or directly into the gun — slowly and awkwardly due {{to the absence of}} a human loader.|$|R
50|$|Upon loading, a NLM {{requests}} resources, such as {{memory and}} process threads, from the NetWare kernel. The NetWare kernel tracks such requests, and can identify memory {{and other resources}} assigned to a specific NLM. NLMs may <b>auto-load</b> other NLMs upon which they themselves depend.|$|R
50|$|Apollo {{was fitted}} {{out as a}} general purpose frigate. Her armaments were: 2 × 4.5 inch (114mm) Vickers 45 Mk6 naval guns mounted in a single twin turret with MRS3/Plessey Type 904 gunnery control system; quadruple Seacat missile {{launcher}} platform with GWS22 guidance system; Mk10 anti-submarine triple barrel mortar tubes (<b>auto-load,</b> 92 kg warhead); Westland Wasp helicopter and two 20mm Oerlikon cannon.|$|R
25|$|Peak {{strength}} in LAA defences against the hit-and-run attacks was reached in March 1943, {{and the success}} rate began to rise that month. On 11 March a force of 20 aircraft attacked Hastings, of which four were shot down (Category I hits) and one damaged (Cat III) by the massed LAA defences. But on 3 April, when 12 enemy aircraft bombed and machine-gunned Eastbourne from the landward side, the Bofors gunners' predictors and range-finders were useless. Only firing with 'open sights' as with the 20mm and LMGs was effective. The Bofors guns were equipped with <b>auto-loading</b> devices to increase their rate of fire, and gunshields to protect the crews. Further RAF and Canadian LAA gunners 'thickened up' the defences in the regimental area.|$|E
25|$|The Leclerc is {{equipped}} with a GIAT (Nexter) CN120-26 120mm smoothbore cannon. This cannon is capable of firing the same NATO standard 120mm rounds as the German Leopard 2 and US M1 Abrams, but in practice only French-produced ammunition is issued. The gun is insulated with a thermal sleeve and has an automatic compressed-air fume extraction system instead of the usual bore evacuator. The Leclerc has a unique autoloading system which was specifically designed for it, and reduces the crew to three by eliminating the human loader. The turret of the Leclerc was designed around the <b>auto-loading</b> system {{in order to avoid the}} problems common to other tanks with an autoloader. The Leclerc autoloader allows a rate of fire of 12 shots per minute and holds 22 rounds of ready ammunition; it can accommodate up to six different types of ammunition at once, although like most autoloader systems it cannot change ammunition types once a round has been loaded. The most common types are the armour piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS) with a tungsten core and the high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round. There are 18 other rounds available for reload. A Leclerc tank can fire while traveling at a speed of 50km/h on a target 4,000 metres away. The gun is 52 calibres long instead of the 44 calibres common on most tanks of the Leclerc's generation, giving the rounds a higher muzzle velocity.|$|E
2500|$|In 1906, Remington Arms {{introduced}} the [...] "Remington <b>Auto-loading</b> Repeating Rifle." [...] Remington advertised this rifle, renamed the [...] "Model 8" [...] in 1911, as a sporting rifle. This is a locked-breech, long recoil action designed by John Browning. The rifle was offered in [...]25, [...]30, [...]32, and [...]35 caliber models, and gained popularity among civilians {{as well as}} some law enforcement officials who appreciated the combination of a semi-automatic action and relatively powerful rifle cartridges. The Model 81 superseded the Model 8 in 1936 and was offered in [...]300 Savage as well as the original Remington calibers.|$|E
50|$|The T-84 entered {{service with}} the Military of Ukraine in 1999, {{and the more}} {{advanced}} Oplot version in 2001. The tank is actively marketed for export, and can incorporate Russian countermeasure systems and a French fire-control system. The T-84-120 and Yatagan has been developed employing an <b>auto-loaded</b> 120mm tank gun which fires NATO ammunition as well as ATGMs. Versions have seen trials in Greece, Turkey, and Malaysia.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, the Soviets {{embraced the}} main battle tank (MBT) concept, by {{replacing}} heavy tanks with mobile medium tanks. In the late 1960s, the independent tank battalions with heavy tanks were re-equipped with the higher-technology T-64s, and later, the very fast T-80, while regular tank and mechanized units fielded the more basic T-55s and T-72s. T-10 production was stopped in 1966, and heavy tank projects were cancelled, {{such as the}} <b>auto-loaded,</b> 130 mm-armed Obiekt 770.|$|R
5000|$|Obtaining a {{card was}} free from {{introduction}} in June 2010 to encourage users {{to adopt the}} card, until September 1, 2012 when new adult cards began to cost $3. [...] This charge covers the approximately $2 per card to manufacture and reduces the incentive to throw away the card if the value goes negative when fare is calculated on exit. [...] The $3 fee is waived if the card is registered to <b>auto-load</b> more value (in which case it cannot go negative).|$|R
2500|$|The Ju 88P was a {{specialized}} variant for ground attack and {{to function as}} a bomber destroyer, designed starting from 1942 and produced in small numbers, using examples of the Bordkanone heavy calibre aviation autocannon series, which required the omission of the Bola undernose gondola for clearance. The prototype, derived from a standard Ju 88 A-4, was armed with a 7.5cm anti-tank gun derived from the 7.5 cm PaK 40 installed in a large conformal gun pod under the fuselage. This was followed by a small batch of Ju 88 P-1, which standardized the solid sheet metal nose of the C version for all known examples of the P-series, and used the new 7.5cm PaK 40L semi-automatic gun, also known as the Bordkanone BK 7,5, which was also meant for use in both the later Henschel Hs 129B-3 dedicated anti-armor aircraft, and a never-achieved production version of the He 177A-3/R5 ground-attack Flak-suppression Stalingradtyp field-improvised version. The Ju 88P-1 was produced in some 40 units, but with the massive cannon installation resulting in a slow and vulnerable aircraft, it was soon replaced by the Ju 88 P-2, featuring two Bordkanone 3.7cm BK 3,7 guns, whose higher muzzle velocity proved useful against the Russian tanks in the Eastern Front. This aircraft was used by Erprobungskommando 25. The Ju 88 P-3 also used the twin BK 3,7 guns, and added further armor for the crew, and was delivered at one Staffel of the Nachtschlachtgruppen 1, 2, 4, 8 and 9 for night attacks in the Eastern Front, in northern Norway (NSGr 8) and Italy (NSGr 9). Finally, the Ju 88 P-4 mounted a smaller-volume ventral gun pod housing a 5cm <b>auto-loading</b> Bordkanone BK 5 cannon (the same ordnance used for the field-improvised [...] handful of [...] Stalingradtyp He 177As created) and, in some cases, 6.5cm solid propellant rockets.|$|E
50|$|Auto-Loading: UMDs were {{designed}} for possible future slot loading devices with <b>Auto-Loading</b> mechanisms. These would be {{very similar to the}} <b>auto-loading</b> mechanism used in slot loading MiniDisc home and car decks. It would also be similar to the Sony U-Matic <b>auto-loading</b> mechanism. Unlike the current clamshell loading design the PSP uses, a slot loading device using an <b>Auto-Loading</b> mechanism would be motorized and completely automatic. The user would insert the disc into the device slot, the motorized mechanism would then take over and draw the disc inside the drive completing the loading process. The disc would also be ejected fully automatically by the motorized mechanism, like a VCR. This would also mean that power would be required in order to insert or eject a disc.|$|E

5000|$|T-80B (Ob'yekt 219R) (1978) - This {{first major}} {{redesign}} features a modified turret with new composite K ceramic armor providing better protection against APFSDS kinetic energy penetrators. The protection {{level of the}} turret increased from 410 mm of steel to 500 mm of steel. It also includes 1A33 fire control system, 9K112-2 system which allows firing 9M112 [...] "Kobra" [...] (NATO code: AT-8 Songster) ATGM using the tank's barrel. The missile control box is mounted {{in front of the}} cupola and has angled support. The ATGM may be launched while moving slowly and can be <b>auto-loaded</b> with the two halves mated during ramming but the stub charge is manually loaded. Unlike T-80, T-80B does not have a splash plate on glacis plate.|$|R
5000|$|The TYPHOON-2A is {{primarily}} armed with an <b>auto-loaded</b> 125 mm smooth-bore KBM-1M 48 caliber gun capable of 8 rpm. It can fire APFSDS-T ammunition (arrow), HEAT-TANDEM (shaped charge), and high explosive HE-FRAG with an effective range up to 3,000 m. It also carries [...] {{anti-tank guided missile}} firing HEAT-TANDEM at an effective range exceeding 5,000m. Missiles are capable of targeting ground targets and helicopters flying at low altitude. Secondary armament is a remotely controlled 12.7×108mm KT-12.7 machine gun. The TIPHOON-2A may also be fitted with a co-axial 7.62×54mmR KT-7.62 machine gun. Fire control on the TIPHOON-2A 2 is a ballistics computer LIO-V operated by both the gunner and the commander. The TIPHOON-2A can function at night using BURAN CATHERINE-E thermal vision {{with a range of}} 12 km.|$|R
25|$|On April 4, 2016, Translink's new fare gates were {{implemented}} for ridership on SkyTrain and SeaBus. To open the fare gates, to enter or exit the system, a Compass Card must be used. Compass Cards {{may be used}} to pay fares on and buses, although FareSaver tickets may still be used on buses. Buses continue issue paper passes for fares paid in cash. Neither FareSavers nor the transfer tickets {{may be used to}} open fare gates. Compass Cards work on all transit services using a tap in method to pay fares. Tap out however is not required on buses. The cards may be loaded with monthly passes, day passes, or stored value, or any combination, with the ability to <b>auto-load</b> the fare choice. Annual passes have been eliminated.|$|R

5000|$|Derived {{from the}} [...] heavy cruisers, they were larger, had an {{improved}} machinery layout, {{and carried a}} new design of <b>auto-loading,</b> rapid-fire 8"/55 gun (the Mk16). [...] The improved Mk16 guns of the main battery were the first <b>auto-loading</b> 8" [...] guns fielded by the US Navy, and allowed a much higher rate of fire than earlier designs, capable of sustaining seven shots per minute per barrel, or about twice what previous heavy cruisers could. The <b>auto-loading</b> mechanism could function at any elevation, giving even these large-caliber guns some anti-aircraft ability. While the secondary battery of six twin 5"/38 Mk12 DP guns was essentially unchanged from the preceding [...] and Baltimore-class cruisers, the Des Moines class carried a stronger battery of small-caliber anti-aircraft guns, including 12 twin 3-inch/50 Mk27 and later Mk33 guns, that were considered superior to the earlier ships' quad-mounted 40mm Bofors against then current airborne threats.|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s smoothbore tank {{guns were}} {{developed}} by the Soviet Union and later by the experimental US - FRG MBT-70 project. Based on their experience with the gun/missile system of the BMP-1, the Soviets produced the T-64B main battle tank, with an <b>auto-loaded</b> 2A46 125 mm smoothbore high-velocity tank gun, capable of firing APFSDS ammunition as well as ATGMs. Similar guns continue {{to be used in}} the latest Russian T-90, Ukrainian T-84, and Serbian M-84AS MBTs. The German company Rheinmetall developed a more conventional 120 mm smoothbore tank gun which can fire LAHAT missiles, adopted for the Leopard 2, and later the U.S. M1 Abrams. The chief advantages of smoothbore designs are their greater suitability for fin stabilised ammunition and their greatly reduced barrel wear compared with rifled designs. Much of the difference in operation between smoothbore and rifled guns shows in the type of secondary ammunition that they fire, with a smoothbore gun being ideal for firing HEAT rounds (although specially designed HEAT rounds can be fired from rifled guns) and rifling being necessary to fire HESH rounds.|$|R
50|$|The polar {{opponent}} of the Soviet tanks was the defensively-designed Swedish Stridsvagn 103. While it resembled a tank destroyer, {{it was actually a}} tracked tank-turret serving the role of a tank. This turretless vehicle was designed to nearly disappear in a hull-down position. It had an even lower profile than Soviet MBTs, with a fixed, <b>auto-loaded</b> gun that was nearly flat against the roof; the entire tank hull moved to elevate, depress, or traverse the gun. This radical design was specialized for combat in forested terrain. Unlike with turreted tanks, the tree-stems would not prevent the Stridsvagn 103 from traversing its gun as the hull would either displace the tree or simply rotate around it. Thus, it could control a section of road whilst being both concealed and covered. The Stridsvagn 103C also had an integral dozer blade, so it could dig itself in. The engine was equipped with equal numbers of gears both forward and in reverse which together with a second set of rear-facing driver controls for the radio operator allowed to withdraw from a hull-down position at full speed while keeping its frontal armour pointed at the enemy.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]25 Remington (also {{known as}} the [...]25 Remington <b>Auto-Loading)</b> is an American rifle cartridge. A rimless, {{smokeless}} powder design, this cartridge {{was considered to be}} very accurate by period firearm experts and suitable for game up to deer and black bear.|$|E
5000|$|A {{semi-automatic}} rifle, {{also known}} as a self-loading rifle ('SLR') or <b>auto-loading</b> rifle, is a self-loading rifle that fires a single round each time the trigger is pulled. In contrast, a fully automatic rifle continuously fires rounds as long as the trigger is pressed and there is ammunition left.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Eugene Stoner {{designed}} the AR-10 battle rifle to equip U.S. troops. It was accurate for an <b>auto-loading</b> rifle, but it lost the competition to the M14 rifle. The patent {{rights for the}} AR-10 and the AR-15 were sold to Colt's Manufacturing Company. Colt focused on the AR-15, giving others the ability {{to capitalize on the}} AR-10 system.|$|E
5000|$|This gun uses semi-fixed ammunition. (Pictured) [...] (Also called Separated Ammunition.) Each round {{consists}} of a projectile and a powder case. The {{two parts of the}} round are kept separate until they get to the gun. At the gun, they are first combined on the rammer tray, and then power rammed into the chamber together with one ram cycle. The powder case completely fills the volume of the chamber, and its length seats the projectile's rotating band into the bore's rifling. This is different from a naval bag gun. In a bag gun: (1) The projectile, by itself, is power rammed into the chamber until its rotating band is seated in the bore's rifling. (2) The rammer is retracted. (3) The powder bags are then rammed in. This is also different from some artillery field guns: (1) The projectile is hand rammed into the chamber with a ramrod until its rotating band is seated in the bore's rifling. (2) The ramrod is retracted. (3) Next powder is placed in the chamber either as a bag or primed canister with the required charge. Note that the single ram operation used in semi-fixed guns decreases the loading time, and therefore increases the firing rate on medium and large caliber guns. For example, each of the nine 8"(203mm)/55 caliber Rapid-Fire guns installed on the [...] used <b>auto-loaded</b> semi-fixed ammunition and had a firing rate of 10 to 12 rounds a minute. [...] See also the 8"/55 caliber Mark 71 gun.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, SOCOM {{requested}} Black Hills Ammunition {{to develop}} ammunition for the Mk 12 SPR that SOCOM was designing. For the rifle {{to be accurate}} out to 600 yards, Black Hills [...] "militarized" [...] a cartridge that used the Sierra 77 grain OTM (Open Tip Match) projectile; it switched from a [...]223 Remington to 5.56 mm case, increased pressure loading, crimped and sealed the primer, and added a flash retardant to the powder. The Mk 262 Mod 0 was adopted in 2002. Issues came up in development including reliability problems in different temperatures and when the weapon got dirty, and cycling issues in cold weather due to the slightly shorter barrel of the SPR compared to the full-length M16A2 barrel. The problems were addressed with a slower burning powder with a different pressure {{for use in the}} barrel, creating the Mk 262 Mod 1 in 2003. During the product improvement stage, the new propellant was found to be more sensitive to heat in weapon chambers during rapid firings, resulting in increased pressures and failure to extract. This was addressed with another powder blend with higher heat tolerance and improved brass. Also during the stage, Black Hills wanted the bullet to be given a cannelure, which had been previously rejected for fear it would affect accuracy. It was eventually added for effective crimping to ensure that the projectile would not move back into the case and cause a malfunction during <b>auto-load</b> feeding. Although the temperature sensitive powder and new bullet changed specifications, the designation remained as the Mod 1.|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of convective weather modeling with trajectory automation for conflict detection, trial planning, direct routing, and auto resolution has uncovered {{a concept that}} could help controllers, dispatchers, and pilots identify improved weather routes that result in significant savings in flying time and fuel burn. Trajectory automation continuously and automatically monitors aircraft in flight to find those that could potentially benefit from improved weather reroutes. Controllers, dispatchers, and pilots then evaluate reroute options to assess their suitability given current weather and traffic. In today's operations aircraft fly convective weather avoidance routes that were implemented often hours before aircraft approach the weather and automation does not exist to automatically monitor traffic to find improved weather routes that open up due to changing weather conditions. The automation concept runs in real-time and employs two keysteps. First, a direct routing algorithm automatically identifies flights with large dog legs in their routes and therefore potentially large savings in flying time. These are common - and usually necessary - during convective weather operations and analysis of Fort Worth Center traffic shows many aircraft with short cuts that indicate savings {{on the order of}} 10 flying minutes. The second and most critical step is to apply trajectory automation with weather modeling to determine what savings could be achieved by modifying the direct route such that it avoids weather and traffic and is acceptable to controllers and flight crews. Initial analysis of Fort Worth Center traffic suggests a savings of roughly 50 % of the direct route savings could be achievable. The core concept is to apply trajectory automation with convective weather modeling in real time to identify a reroute that is free of weather and traffic conflicts and indicates enough time and fuel savings to be considered. The concept is interoperable with today's integrated FMS/datalink. Auxiliary(lat/long) waypoints define a minimum delay reroute between current position and a downstream capture fix beyond the weather. These auxiliary waypoints can be uplinked to equipped aircraft and <b>auto-loaded</b> into the FMS. Alternatively, for unequipped aircraft, auxiliary waypoints can be replaced by nearby named fixes, but this could reduce potential savings. The presentation includes an overview of the automation approach and focuses on several cases in terms of potential savings, reroute complexity, best auxiliary waypoint solution vs. named fix solution, and other metrics...|$|R

50|$|A {{suppressor}} also cools the {{hot gases}} {{coming out of}} the barrel enough that most of the lead-laced vapor that leaves the barrel condenses inside the suppressor, reducing the amount of lead that might be inhaled by the shooter and others around them.
