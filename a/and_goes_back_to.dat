The Scottish Gaelic term fear gorm, meaning [...] "blue men", is the descriptor for a negro according to Dwelly. Thus sruth nam fear gorm, one of the blue men's Gaelic names, literally translates as [...] "stream of the blue men", or [...] "river, tide or stream of the blue negro". Around the 9th century the Vikings took Moors they had captured and were using as slaves to Ireland.

"On {{the night}} before such an event neither Mamma, Pappa, or Daughter Gale could get those minutes' solid sleep for thought {{that they might have}} {{overlooked}} some essential in the guests' comfort. At the first crow of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the larder into shape. So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie. First Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state, and give it a stir; then Pappa Gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir; finally Daughter Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise. Then arrived the guests. The Minister and the Mrs. Minister, they were, and some neighbors. While she was receiving them the recollection came to Mamma Gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavoring. Off she speeds to a decanter of whiskey in the kitchen. She pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor, <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her guests. Then Pappa Gale remembers that the pie has not been flavored. He, too, excuses himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince. No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than Daughter Gale, who has just remembered about the forgotten flavoring, rushes in and makes for the whiskey. She pours 'the right proportion' in, too." ...|$|E
