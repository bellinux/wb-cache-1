This hum is usually at the second harmonic of the power line frequency (100 Hz or 120 Hz), since the heavy ground currents are from <b>AC</b> to <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> that rectify the mains waveform.

This paper considers the design and evaluation of transformer-based and transformer less-based variable regulated <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> {{with the aim of}} presenting a comparative analysis between them; and their respective areas of applications. The quality, cost, size, weight, performance and efficient production of <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> thus pose a great deal of concern and attention in the <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> production of any electronic device. The design methodology used in this work involves Software design for component selection, improved hardware design, computer simulation and evaluation of transformation, rectification, filtration and regulation stages for both transformer-based and transformer less-based adjustable <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> with graphical outputs. The results obtained after following the design specification was very satisfactory. The transformer-based has a robust output current and well isolated from the supply voltage, which makes it more suitable for high current application, highly reliable for powering electronics devices while the transformer less based DC source has smaller size, weight and cheaper so as to miniaturize electronics devices but limited to low current devices. It also generates far less noise, heat, input harmonic distortion levels, and higher transient response but lack of proper isolation unlike its counterpart thus result in lower Mean Time To Failure (MTTF). Transformer less variable <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> should be considered a viable option for lower power, small and low current applications where achieving the highest availability is not the top concern and cost, size and weight restrictions inhibit the use of traditional transformer-based <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|R
