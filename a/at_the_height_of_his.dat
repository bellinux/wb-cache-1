5|$|The 1939–40 {{season was}} Bradman's most {{productive}} ever for SA: 1,448runs {{at an average}} of 144.8. He made three double centuries, including 251 not out against NSW, the innings that he rated the best he ever played in the Sheffield Shield, as he tamed Bill O'Reilly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> form. However, {{it was the end of}} an era. The outbreak of World War Two led to the indefinite postponement of all cricket tours, and the suspension of the Sheffield Shield competition.|$|E

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{career as}} a {{director}} Whale directed The Road Back (1937), a sequel to All Quiet on the Western Front. Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision {{and it was a}} critical and commercial failure. A run of similar box-office disappointments followed and, while he would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was over. He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. He committed suicide on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{success with}} United, Bruce was {{contacted}} by Jack Charlton, {{manager of the}} Republic of Ireland national team, who had discovered that, due to his mother's place of birth, Bruce was eligible to play for Ireland. Bruce states in his autobiography that further investigation revealed that, while his earlier appearance for England B in a friendly match was not an issue, his appearances for the England Youth team in a UEFA-sanctioned tournament prohibited him from playing for the senior team of another country. He has subsequently claimed that {{he chose not to}} play for Ireland as it would have caused problems for his club at a time when UEFA restricted the number of foreign players that a club could have in their squad in its competitions.|$|E
5|$|He shot 70 films {{over the}} sixteen {{years of his}} career, working with such {{prominent}} directors as William Wellman, Raoul Walsh, Michael Curtiz, Archie Mayo, and William Dieterle. He {{was a member of}} the American Society of Cinematographers by 1921, and he was also one of the inaugural members of the International Photographers branch of I.A.T.S.E. (International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees). In October 1932, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career, he suddenly fell ill after wrapping a film. Hospitalized, his condition quickly worsened and within a week he was dead of an infection to the brain.|$|E

5|$|In 1261, Alexander III, King of Scots (died 1286) sent an {{emissary}} to Norway {{to discuss}} the Isles. Negotiations proved fruitless, and the following year William I, Earl of Ross (died 1274) is recorded to have launched a vicious attack on Skye. The assault was likely carried out on behalf of Alexander, {{in response to the}} failure of Scottish mission to Norway the year previous. In response, Hákon organised a massive military force to re-assert Norwegian control along the western seaboard of Scotland. At this time, the Norwegian king was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> power, and his only son had just recently been recognised as heir to the throne.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 Paraná {{was again}} {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Council of Ministers, {{at the head of}} a highly successful cabinet, and became the most powerful politician in the country. The electoral reform he ushered in was credited with undermining national political processes and causing severe harm to the system of parliamentary government. For his role in pushing through restructuring, Paraná met with fierce opposition from the majority of his colleagues, leading to a virtual split in the Conservative Party over his policies. On 3 September 1856, while still in office and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> political career, he died unexpectedly of an unknown febrile condition. He is widely regarded by historians as one of the most influential statesmen of his time.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, he was {{involved}} in a horrific on-field incident with Geelong's Steven King. As King attempted to kick the ball out of mid-air, he missed and collected White's face <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> leg's swing, causing facial injuries that required extensive surgery, inserting five metal plates and 14screws into White's jaw and face. It was viewed as an accident by the AFL tribunal and no action was taken against King. As the incident took place in Melbourne's final match of the season—Geelong winning the match and knocking Melbourne out of the finals—White was able to recover during the off-season and did not miss a match, despite the severity of the injury. White's wedding to his fiancée Stacy was postponed until later in the year due to the injury.|$|E

5|$|Paraná invited several liberals to {{join the}} {{conservative}} ranks and {{went so far as}} to name some as ministers. The new cabinet, although highly successful, was plagued from the start by strong opposition from ultraconservative members of the Conservative Party who repudiated the new liberal recruits. They believed that the cabinet had become a political machine infested with converted liberals who did not genuinely share the party's ideals and were primarily interested in gaining public offices. Despite this mistrust, Paraná showed resilience in fending off threats and overcoming obstacles and setbacks. However, in September 1856, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career, he died unexpectedly, although the cabinet survived him until May 1857.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{fame and}} success, while The Importance of Being Earnest (1895) {{was still being}} {{performed}} in London, Wilde had the Marquess of Queensberry prosecuted for criminal libel. The Marquess {{was the father of}} Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. The libel trial unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to his own arrest and trial for gross indecency with men. After two more trials he was convicted and sentenced to two years' hard labour, the maximum penalty, and was jailed from 1895 to 1897. During his last year in prison, he wrote De Profundis (published posthumously in 1905), a long letter which discusses his spiritual journey through his trials, forming a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure. Upon his release, he left immediately for France, never to return to Ireland or Britain. There he wrote his last work, The Ballad of Reading Gaol (1898), a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life. He died destitute in Paris at the age of 46.|$|E
5|$|Gilligan played cricket for Dulwich College {{before the}} First World War, then for Cambridge, twice winning his blue. He briefly played county cricket for Surrey but moved to Sussex in 1920. Following {{a slow start}} to his county career, he rapidly {{improved}} and in partnership with Maurice Tate established a formidable bowling reputation. First playing for England in 1922, he was appointed Test captain in 1924. In the latter year, Gilligan was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> form when he suffered a blow to his heart while batting. The strain affected his bowling, which was never again as effective, but he still captained England in Australia during the 1924–25 season. The series was lost, but both {{he and his team}} were popular and respected. In following years, he played less frequently; he resigned as Sussex captain in 1929 and retired three years later. He subsequently became a writer, journalist and cricket commentator while maintaining his connections with Sussex.|$|E
