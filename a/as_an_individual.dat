30|$|Cognitive ability {{measures}} are often taken as explanatory variables in regression analysis, e.g., <b>as</b> <b>a</b> factor affecting a market outcome such <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> wage, or <b>a</b> decision such <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> education acquisition. Cognitive ability is a latent construct; its true value is unobserved. Nonetheless, researchers often {{assume that a}} test score, constructed via standard psychometric practice from individuals’ responses to test items, can be safely used in regression analysis. We examine problems that can arise, and suggest that an alternative approach, a “mixed effects structural equations” (MESE) model, may be more appropriate in many circumstances.|$|R

News of his death spread quickly, and became a symbol of the abuses perpetrated under the apartheid government. Biko's position <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> who had never been convicted of a crime led to the death being reported in the international press; he thus became one of first anti-apartheid activists widely known internationally.|$|E

5|$|Cheney's {{record as}} CEO {{was subject to}} some dispute among Wall Street analysts.

30|$|Theoretical inferences have {{identified}} roles of various psychological constructs on {{different types of}} entrepreneurship behavior. This study however attempts to establish an empirical basis for the influence of career adaptability, ambiguity tolerance, need for achievement and mentoring support on entrepreneurial intuition. These psychological constructs have been touted to be correlates of implicit learning; which Lieberman (2000) suggests {{is the source of}} intuition. Career adaptability is defined <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> readiness to cope with unanticipated transitions in future career possibilities (Savickas, 2002); tolerance for ambiguity is defined <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> disposition towards decisions or events with vague outcomes (McLain, 2009); need for achievement is the extent of <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> desire for significant accomplishment and high standards (Ogunleye & Osagu, 2014); while mentoring support is defined as the extent of inspirational and motivational support that protégés have received from mentors on entrepreneurship issues (Okurame, 2012).|$|R
