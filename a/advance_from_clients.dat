40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "GAO previously found that {{a significant portion of}} the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) working capital fund contained a growing carryover balance. Almost all of the fund's resources come <b>from</b> appropriations <b>advanced</b> <b>from</b> federal <b>clients</b> for NIST's technical services through interagency agreements. Monitoring and tracking key information about agreements and the funds advanced for them is critical for both NIST and its clients to make well-informed budget decisions, comply with applicable fiscal laws and internal controls, and ensure the proper use of federal funds. GAO was asked to review (1) the factors contributing to the working capital fund's carryover balance and (2) NIST's processes for managing its interagency agreements and workload. To do so, GAO reviewed laws and fiscal requirements, analyzed NIST budget data and policies related to its interagency agreements, analyzed a random sample of agreements, and interviewed NIST officials. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{most notorious}} {{criminal}} {{of the period}} (aside from the Nazis and their collaborators) was Doctor Marcel Petiot. Petiot purchased a house at 21 rue Le Sueur in the 16th arrondissement, and {{under the name of}} Docteur Eugène, pretended to be the head of a Resistance network that smuggled Jews from France to Argentina. He collected a large <b>advance</b> <b>from</b> his <b>clients</b> and then instructed them to come to his house, bringing their gold, silver and other valuables with them. After they arrived, he brought them to his consulting room, and, convincing them vaccination was required in order to enter Argentina, gave them a lethal intravenous injection, then watched their slow death in an adjacent room through a spyhole in the door. Afterwards, he cut up their bodies, put the pieces in the well, and dissolved them with quicklime. His activities attracted the attention of the Gestapo, which arrested him in 1943, thus allowing him to claim later that he had been a real member of the Resistance. His crimes were discovered after the Liberation in 1944, and he was charged with the murders of twenty-seven persons, tried in 1946, and sentenced to death. He went to the guillotine on May 25, 1946. The gold, silver and other valuables were not found when he was arrested. In search of the treasure, the house was carefully demolished in 1966, but no trace of it was ever found.|$|R

We use firm-level panel data on exporting and productivity with direct information on learning sources, including clients. We find: (a) firms who exported {{in the past}} are likely to learn more <b>from</b> <b>clients</b> (relative to other sources); (b) firms who learned <b>from</b> <b>clients</b> in the past {{are more likely to}} have faster productivity growth; (c) the reverse is not the case i. e. past productivity growth is not associated with more learning <b>from</b> <b>clients</b> and past learning <b>from</b> <b>clients</b> is not associated with more exporting. These results are consistent with the learning-by-exporting hypothesis. 2...|$|R

40|$|Although {{research}} on therapist development indicates that therapists attribute {{the majority of}} their learning about therapy to their clients (e. g., Orlinsky, Botermans & Ronnestad, 2001), learning <b>from</b> <b>clients</b> has only been explicitly addressed in anecdotal accounts (Bugental, 1991; Crawford, 1987; Freeman & Hayes, 2002; Kahn & Fromm, 2002). The closest researchers have come to empirically investigating learning <b>from</b> <b>clients</b> is by studying the impact of clients on their therapists (e. g., Farber, 1985; Myers 2002). However, this literature {{is still in its infancy}} and warrants further exploration. The purpose of this study was to extend the literature on therapist development and the impact of clients on their therapists to the study of learning <b>from</b> <b>clients.</b> To this end, 12 trainees (5 male; 7 female) who had recently completed pre-doctoral internships at university counseling centers were interviewed about what they learn <b>from</b> <b>clients.</b> In addition, participants were asked how they realized what they learned <b>from</b> <b>clients,</b> what they do with what they learn <b>from</b> <b>clients</b> and what variables contribute to how much they learn <b>from</b> <b>clients.</b> The data were analyzed using Consensual Qualitative Research (Hill, Knox, Thompson, Williams, Hess, & Ladany, 2005; Hill, Thompson, & Williams, 1997). Participants reported learning things about doing therapy, themselves, client dynamics, human nature, the therapy relationship, and the usefulness of supervision; these lessons were reflective or participants' level of development as they primarily reported learning higher-order skills (e. g., Cummings, Slemon & Hallberg, 1993; Sakai & Naasserbakht, 1997). In addition, participants highlighted the importance of consultation and self-reflection in order to recognize learning; this is consistent with literature on experiential learning (Abbey, Hunt & Weiser, 1985). In discussing what they do with what they learn <b>from</b> <b>clients,</b> participants indicated they have or will apply what was learned to future clinical work; in addition they indicated that their lessons <b>from</b> <b>clients</b> fostered some kind of personal growth. Finally, participants indicated that a number of variables influenced the amount they learned from their clients: therapist, client, and therapy relationship characteristics, time, a new or remarkable therapy process, and new supervisors or settings. Implications for practice and research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} how social workers who works in social services in Sweden talk about and construct threats and violence <b>from</b> <b>clients</b> as a problem within their workgroup. The data in this study was collected through two focus group discussions with eleven social workers divided in two different work groups. The discussions were thereafter analyzed through a perspective analysis. The findings in this study shows that the social workers that participated had difficulties in defining threats and violence <b>from</b> <b>clients</b> because it was considered to be individual for every social worker. Furthermore, the study also shows that the social workers felt that threats and violence <b>from</b> <b>clients</b> came with the job and therefore had to accept it. Another finding the study showed is that the social workers tend to take responsibility for the threats and violence they were exposed <b>from</b> <b>clients...</b>|$|R
