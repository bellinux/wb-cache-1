40|$|Cost {{effectiveness}} {{is central to}} the air freight forwarders. In this work, we study how an <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> should plan its cargo loading in order to minimize the total freight cost given a limited number of rented containers. To solve the problem efficiently for practical implementation, we propose a new large-scale neighborhood search heuristic. The proposed large-scale neighborhood relaxes the subset-disjoint restriction made in the existing literature; the relaxation risks a possibility of infeasible exchanges {{while at the same time}} it avoids the potentially large amount of checking effort required to enforce the subset-disjoint restriction. An efficient procedure is then used to search for improvement in the neighborhood. We have also proposed a subproblem to address the difficulties caused by the fixed charges. The compromised large-scale neighborhood (CLSN) search heuristic has shown stably superior performance when compared with the traditional large-scale neighborhood search and the mixed integer programming model.

In addition, {{an explanation of the}} use of international air freight forwarding is even more difficult to find. This study reviews various sources of transportation information for the benefit of an end-user Supply Officer onboard a Naval vessel which may be deployed to the Indian Ocean, and who will have need for knowledge of how material will reach him in accordance with established directives and the UMMIPS time standards. This study highlights the air logistic channels in use to the Indian Ocean with emphasis {{on the use of the}} international <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder.</b> The author's conclusion is that Navy publications, directives, instructions, and briefings need to be updated to reflect the methods and procedures for using the air freight forwarders services and the transportation channels in use.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>freight</b> {{transport}} plays a {{vital role}} in Germany’s foreign trade and contributes to Germany’s position as one of the leading exporting countries worldwide. Although the volume of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> accounts for only 1. 5 percent of the exports measured in tons, the value of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> exports amounts to 25 percent of Germany’s external trade. In particular, <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> transport forms an important part of logistic concepts and supply chains of commercial and industrial enterprises for the shipment of high-value and time-sensitive goods. However, only relatively little research has been conducted in air transport with regard to the spatial differentiated generation and distribution of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> compared to the state of research in passenger transport. The main research objective is to gain advanced insights and a profound understanding of the demand generating determinants and structures of <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> on a regional scale and its distribution patterns in the transportation system. In particular, the paper aims to investigate the generation of the disaggregated industry-specific <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> demand in Germany and its interdependencies with the economic activities on a regional level.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} the {{liability}} of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> according to national and international law. The liability of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> is an extremely complex issue for theoretical examination. The latter is especially case considering the process of complete transformation of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> position that <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> experienced {{in the last decade}} of 21 -st century. Considering the fact that process of transformation of freight forwar-ders position imposed a new terminology determinant - logistic operators, in this paper we use the term <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders,</b> and emphasize that the subject of examination is conventional/classical <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders.</b> Theoretical examination of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> status is vital for clarification of many practical dilemmas and disputes in logistic sector. The determination of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> liability is aimed at reducing of judical and arbitral disputes in Macedonian practice, and analysis of the legal regime of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder’s</b> liability in the context of international shiiping, which present the main goal of this paper. The clarification of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> liability is closely related to the determination of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> position towards his principal and the third party in the obligation. For the purposes of the determination of <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> liability, the position of <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> in front of the customs services, insurance companies, warehouses, companies for control of {{the quality and quantity of}} the goods, will be a subject of consideration...|$|R

5000|$|International ocean <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> {{arranging}} for shipments {{to and from}} the US must be licensed by the Federal Maritime Commission as Ocean Transportation Intermediaries. An Ocean Transportation Intermediary is either an ocean <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> or a non-vessel-operating common carrier (NVOCC). An ocean <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> is [...] "an individual or company in the United States that dispatches shipments from the United States via common carriers and books or otherwise arranges space for those shipments on behalf of shippers; ocean <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> prepare and process documentation and perform related activities pertaining to shipments." [...] An NVOCC is [...] "a common carrier that holds itself out to the public to provide ocean transportation, issues its own bills of lading or equivalent documents, but does not operate the vessels that transport cargo"; or, [...] "a shipper in its relationship with the vessel-operating common carrier involved in the movement of cargo." [...] Companies may obtain both licenses and may act in both capacities. The U.S. legal distinction between the two is that a <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> acts as the agent of a principal (typically a shipper or consignee) whereas the NVOCC is a transportation company (carrier) that is physically responsible for the carriage of goods and acts as its own principal. Companies acting strictly as an Ocean <b>Freight</b> <b>Forwarder</b> typically do not issue their own contract of carriage (bill of lading) and as agent are generally not liable for physical loss or damage to cargo except in cases of errors in judgment or paperwork or fiduciary responsibility. NVOCC s act as ocean freight carrier and issue their own bill of lading and are legally responsible for physical loss or damage in accordance with the terms and conditions of their bill of lading and tariff. Similar to other countries, <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> that handle international <b>air</b> <b>freight</b> frequently obtain accreditation with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) as a cargo agent; however, they must obtain an Indirect Air Carrier (IAC) certification from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

40|$|Present {{research}} paper {{is focused on}} the comparative aspects of <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders.</b> Starting this paper with theoretical analysis of the “representation doctrine,” and exploring the status of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> in Germany, United Kingdom and United Stated of America, we focused our attention on the liability of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> towards the principal and the third party in civil and common law systems. 　　　　Observing the existing legislation, judicial and arbitration practices, we present {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the two divergent systems of freight forwarders: German legal system versus British and American legal systems/Continental versus Anglo-Saxon legal systems. The main core of this topic is “the concept of representation,” where the place of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> is inevitable. We also analyze the justification of Anglo-Saxon model of <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> with accent on the non-vessel operating common carrier (hereafter NVOCCs), as the most sophisticated model of <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> in global frames. 　　　　This paper also deliberates the legal repercussions of the unsettled status of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> vis-à-vis any third person and his principal. Regarding this issue, economic effects have never been subject of discussion. Just a superficial examination of this topic is enough to conclude that each type of representation lead to achieving one objective and it’s - transferring the economic effects of representation toward the principal. 　　　　Disagreements escalate in the field of obligations regarding the questions: which of the three subjects is in the legal relation and with whom? Who can be a plaintiff or defendant in the civil procedure?! Does the existance of uniform concept of representation is justified? Finally, is it possible to apply the same legal standards for ascertaining the liability of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder</b> in particular legal systems? 　　　　The responses to all of these questions have a great impact on determination of <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> liability. The impact of globalization definitely changed the position of the <b>freight</b> <b>forwarder.</b> So, which of the two systems offers more applicable legal regime for <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders?</b> Is it the civil law or common law system, or in the field of <b>freight</b> <b>forwarders</b> boundaries between these systems are not as much actual as in many other segments of law. ...|$|R
