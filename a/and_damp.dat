40|$|This paper reports an {{isolator}} whose <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> stiffness can be simultaneously {{controlled by}} magnetorheological (MR) fluids and MR elastomers. A hydraulically actuated MTS machine {{was used to}} test this variable stiffness <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> isolator after its prototype. The field-dependent responses including stiffness variability <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> variability, together with the amplitude-dependent response and frequency-dependent responses were separately tested and analyzed successively. The experimental results prove the successful implementation of the as-designed MRE-F isolator with obvious variable <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> stiffness. A new phenomenological model incorporating Bingham model and four-parameter model was developed to describe the dynamic properties of the isolator.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the modal {{properties}} of a structure are directly related to its mass, stiffness, <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> properties. In fact, the modal parameters (eigenvalues and eigenvectors), are solutions to the differential equations of motion, which are written in terms of the mass, stiffness, <b>and</b> <b>damping.</b> This paper focuses on the determination of the functional relationship between variations in the mass, stiffness, <b>and</b> <b>damping,</b> <b>and</b> variations in the modal properties of structures. For small changes, this “sensitivity function ” reduces to a very simple function of variations in the modal frequencies <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> only. This makes it possible to detect, locate, and quantify structural faults by monitoring f equency <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> only. This finding was previously reported by Stubbs et. al. [4], [5], [6]. In this paper the complete sensitivity functions for mass, stiffness, <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> changes are derived, and the validity of the stiffness sensitivity for small changes is verified. It is also pointed out that the Structural Dynamics Modif ation (SDM) technique can be used to determine the additional terms for the complete sensitivity formulas...|$|R

5|$|The teams {{proceeded}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Dewes and Hutton opened for England. Dewes took a single from Lindwall's opening over and thus faced {{the start of}} the second over, which was bowled by Miller, who had troubled him in the past and dismissed him several times. During his short innings, Dewes was visibly nervous and kept on moving around, unable to stand still. Miller caused a stoppage after his first ball to sprinkle sawdust on the slippery <b>and</b> <b>damp</b> crease. With his second ball, he bowled Dewes—who was playing across the line—middle stump for one with an inswinger to leave England at 1/2. He then removed Jack Crapp caught behind from an outside edge for a 23-ball duck, leaving England at 4/23 as play was adjourned for lunch. The paceman ended with 2/5 from eight overs; Lindwall took 6/20 and England were all out for 52. In his last Test innings for the summer, Miller scored five before overbalancing and being stumped. Australia made 389 and led by 337 on the first innings on the second afternoon. Bowling for the second time, Miller struck Crapp {{in the head with a}} bouncer, before bowling him for nine. He then extracted an edge from Hutton—who fell for 64, having top-scored in both innings—to wicket-keeper Tallon, leaving England at 4/153. Miller ended with 2/22 as Australia won by an innings and took a 4–0 series win.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of a double-helical gear system supported by journal bearings is theoretically and experimentally investigated in this study. A bending–torsional–axial coupling model for dynamic analysis of double-helical gear system is developed. Influence of the time-varying mesh stiffness <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> is considered. Oil film stiffness <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> of the supporting journal bearing {{are supposed to}} be time-varying, and the time-varying oil film stiffness <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> are predicted by a back propagation neural network, which is optimized by genetic algorithm. A double-helical gear–rotor–journal bearing system test rig is also established to carry out the experimental investigations, such as the dynamic transmission errors of gear pairs. The comparisons between theoretical and experimental results show that the time-varying oil film dynamic coefficients of journal bearings are an important internal excitation. The theoretical model with time-varying oil film stiffness <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> can predict the gear dynamics more accurate than the model with time-invariant oil film stiffness <b>and</b> <b>damping,</b> <b>and</b> the neural network optimized by genetic algorithm can obtain the time-varying oil film stiffness <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> efficiently <b>and</b> accurately for the dynamic analysis of double-helical gear system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Although {{underground}} structures have stronger aseismic {{performance than}} ground structures, seismic disasters of mountain tunnels were fairly conspicuous in Wenchuan Great Earthquake. On {{the basis of}} seismic disaster analysis, a composite lining designfor tunnel structures across active fault was put forward. Three-dimensional numerical simulation method was used to analyze aseismic <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> effect of this structure. The results show that: (1) After setting aseismic <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> structure, the maximum internal forces value in lining the pattern of internal forces will not change. (2) Aseismic <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> structure setting can directly reduce the bending moment value and increase the axial force and stress force value in lining structure. (3) Relative to aseismic <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> structure, grouting region around damping layer can ameliorate internal force condition in lining structure and improve the effect of aseismic <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> structure. The above research results contribute to provide reference for seismic fortification of tunnel structures across active faults...|$|R

40|$|Representative {{computation}} {{of ground}} response parameters requires accurate information about nonlinear dynamic {{behavior of the}} soil column, commonly incorporated in site response analysis through shear modulus reduction <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> curves which are functions of the strain level.

In this study, an attempt {{has been made to}} identify suitable shear modulus <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> curves for soil grouped into different classes viz. sand, gravel and rock. Soil profiles of sites having surface and bedrock motion recordings are selected from the KiK-Net downhole array database and equivalent linear and total stress nonlinear site response analysis has been carried out by varying the shear modulus <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> curves for different sites. Estimated surface response spectra for each set of shear modulus <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> curves are compared with the observed response spectra at each site, and a detailed analysis is made to find out which set of curves gives a best match with the recorded data. Based on this study, representative property curves for rock, gravel and sand are suggested, which could be used for further site response studies in the region.

40|$|The biodynamic {{response}} of the seated human body has been investigated with 20 males exposed to upward and downward shocks at 13 fundamental frequencies (1 – 16  Hz) and 18 magnitudes (up to ± 8. 3  ms − 2). For 1 - and 2 - degree-of-freedom models, the stiffness <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> coefficients were obtained by fitting seat acceleration waveforms predicted from the measured force to the measured seat acceleration waveform. Stiffness <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> coefficients were also obtained in the frequency domain with random vibration. The optimum stiffness <b>and</b> <b>damping</b> coefficients varied with the magnitude {{and the frequency of}} shocks. With both upward and downward shocks, the resonance frequency of the models decreased from 6. 3 to 4  Hz as the vibration dose values of the shocks increased from 0. 05 to 2. 0  ms − 1. 75.
