40|$|This article {{addresses}} the implications and remaining challenges behind the seemingly happy {{ending of the}} recent EU–China trade dispute on solar products. First, the EU's choice of a specific trade defence measure – anti-dumping – was based on shaky arguments. Second, further trade disputes on green goods are very likely, in particular because China is increasingly implementing domestic support policies on green sectors, bringing down Chinese export prices. Third, trade defence measures could be adopted as an expensive option. Alternatively to this, the EU and China could consider setting up constructive and preventive mechanisms in order to stabilize trade and broaden their economic relationship. Policy relevance In July 2013 the EU <b>accepted</b> an <b>undertaking</b> by Chinese solar wafer, cell, and module manufacturers to fix minimum import prices for their products, along with a volume cap to be imposed on Chinese solar exports to the EU. In spite of the seemingly happy end of a trade dispute between the two {{major players in the}} renewables sector, we show that the possibility of trade disputes over low-carbon products in the near future cannot be ruled out. Drawing on the China–EU photovoltaic 'dumping case', we highlight some weaknesses in the EU's choice to resort to anti-dumping measures and emphasize the urgent need to invent new forms of trade dialogues between the EU and China as first-choice trade dispute settlement policies.

50|$|In face {{of growing}} {{difficulties}} with the economy, popular dissent and increasing diplomatic isolation, the Greek junta was seeking ways for {{a transition to}} some form of parliamentary rule. Papadopoulos sought support from the old political establishment, and Markezinis <b>accepted</b> to <b>undertake</b> the mission to help lead the country back to parliamentary rule in a process that was called metapolitefsi. In September, 1973, he was appointed by Papadopoulos Prime Minister of Greece, with the task to lead Greece to parliamentary rule. He accepted the task, subject to a commitment by Papadopoulos to curtail any military interference. Papadopoulos proceeded to abolish martial law, and eased censorship of the press. Free elections were promised, in which political formations including part of the traditional left-of-center were expected to participate. However, the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), banned since the civil war, and United Democratic Left (EDA), the party which mostly fronted for KKE during the years of democratic rule, were not expected to be re-legitimized nor allowed to participate. In any case, most leading politicians of the old guard, including Karamanlis, Andreas Papandreou, Panagiotis Kanellopoulos and Georgios Mavros, with the exception of former MP and exile Pavlos Vardinogiannis, condemned the attempt at Metapolitefsi by Papadopoulos and Markezinis, and refused to participate in any contacts with the ruling junta, insisting on an unconditional and immediate reinstatement of democratic rule.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Whole body {{computerised}} tomography {{has become}} a standard of care for the investigation of major trauma patients. However, its use varies widely, and current clinical guidelines are not universally <b>accepted.</b> We <b>undertook</b> a systematic {{review of the literature}} to determine whether clinical guidelines for whole body computerised tomography in trauma increase its diagnostic accuracy. Materials and methods A systematic review of Medline, Cinhal and the Cochrane database, supplemented by a manual search of relevant papers was undertaken, with narrative synthesis. Studies comparing clinical guidelines to physician gestalt for the use of whole body computerised tomography in adult trauma were included. Results A total of 887 papers were identified from the electronic databases, and 1 from manual searches. Of these, seven papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Two papers compared clinical guidelines with routine practice: one found increased diagnostic accuracy while the other did not. Two papers investigated the performance of established clinical guidelines and demonstrated moderate sensitivity and low specificity. Two papers compared different components of established triage tools in trauma. One paper devised a de novo clinical decision rule, and demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy with the tool. The outcome criteria used to define a ‘positive’ scan varied widely, making direct comparisons between studies impossible. Conclusions Current clinical guidelines for whole body computerised tomography in trauma may increase the sensitivity of the investigation, but the evidence to support this is limited. There is a need to standardise the definition of a ‘clinically significant’ finding on CT to allow better comparison of diagnostic studies...|$|R
50|$|Stanley {{conceived}} the Maryborough Courthouse as a double-storeyed arcaded pavilion with towers at each corner, sited between Queens Park and the adjacent street. The footprint {{of the building}} was set well back from Wharf Street providing space for a garden forecourt with Jacaranda trees enhancing the principal entrance. Stanley write a memo about his proposal for the Courthouse in September 1875:the design has been arranged so as to place offices of the Department of Roads, Public Lands and Survey {{on the ground floor}} as being more readily accessible from the street, and the courts and offices associated therewith on the upper floor as being removed from noise and as being in a better position as regards ventilation. The material to be employed is brick on stone foundations faced in cement when not covered by verandahs; the roof to be slated and the internal finishings of a plain substantial character.The necessity of segregating the top and bottom floors caused Stanley to provide two separate stair halls {{at each end of the}} pavilion within the two corner towers nearest the park, at the rear of the building, to which access was provided from the north eastern verandah. The northern stair gave access for judges and barristers and the eastern stair was provided for prisoners escorted by police and the public.The Maryborough Courthouse was constructed for about £7,345 after Stanley's initial estimation of about £5,500. Tenders were called on 20 October 1875 and on 19 November 1876 the lowest tender of local contractor, John Thomas Annear was <b>accepted</b> who <b>undertook</b> to complete the building within twelve months.

This is due in large part to the diverse voters who call these districts home. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} how {{a group of}} Australian stakeholders define technical and non-technical skills, identifies those skills that are demanded of graduates at various stages of their career, and assesses the level of stakeholder satisfaction with the skills level of accounting graduates. Further the paper attempts to highlight the views of stakeholders about whose responsibility it is to develop the required set of technical and non technical skills required by accounting graduates {{as they enter the}} workforce. 	Findings indicate that employers are seeking graduates who possess a diverse range of non-technical skills including communication and presentation, self-management, teamwork, initiative and enterprise, problem solving, technological competence and planning and organising skills. Employers also use non-technical skills as discriminators when evaluating graduates. In terms of technical skills basic practical accounting skills, IT skills and industry specific awareness are important. In general employers were not satisfied with the level of communication and problem solving skills and seemed generally to have low expectations in the area of technical skills <b>accepting</b> that they <b>undertake</b> much of the technical training themselves. The discussion about who role it was to develop both technical and non technical skills was most clearly stated as that of the universities.

She was given the post of minister of education from the date of her appointment. During her time as education minister, Simelane introduced a scheme to allow all vulnerable and orphaned primary and secondary school children to be able to attend school, despite the nation demanding a fee for basic education. With a national HIV infection rate of roughly 40%, the highest in the world, many children fell under the category that Simelane was attempting to address. She pledged to release $6.4 million to pay for the children effected and ordered that all children who presented themselves to schools should be <b>accepted.</b> This was <b>undertaken</b> by schools despite concerns that the government would not fulfill its pledge. These fears were realized and despite the government releasing the funds at the end of the academic year, the damage was done and many of the children taken in had already been released and many school heads threatened to strike over the issue. Further education programs introduced by Simelane included free school text books for vulnerable children, but this was deemed as a failure due to many of these children being unable to attend school due to the lack of available fees. She also called upon pregnant girls to be re-admitted to education, as since independence in 1968, standard practice was to expel girls from school if they became pregnant. Although not a governmental law, she gave her backing to the decision made by the Swaziland Schools Headteachers Association.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of COPHES (Consortium to Perform Human biomonitoring on a European Scale) {{was to develop}} a harmonised approach to conduct human biomonitoring on a European scale. COPHES developed a systematic approach for designing and conducting a pilot study for an EU-wide cross-sectional human biomonitoring (HBM) study and for the implementation of the fieldwork procedures. The approach gave the basis for discussion of the main aspects of study design and conduct, and provided a decision making tool which can be applied to many other studies. Each decision that had to be taken was listed in a table of options with their advantages and disadvantages. Based on this the rationale of the decisions could be explained and be transparent. This was important because an EU-wide HBM study demands openness of all decisions taken to encourage as many countries as possible to participate and <b>accept</b> the initiative <b>undertaken.</b> Based on this approach the following study design was suggested: a cross-sectional study including 120 children aged 6 - 11 years and their mothers aged up to 45 years from each participating country. For the pilot study the children should be sampled in equal shares in an urban and a rural location. Only healthy children and mothers (no metabolic disturbances) should be included, who have a sufficient knowledge of the local language and have been living at least for 5 years at the sampling location. Occupational exposure should not be an exclusion criterion. Recruitment should be performed via inhabitant registries or schools as an alternative option. Measures suitable to increase the response rate should be applied. Preferably, the families should be visited at home and interviewed face-to-face. Various quality control measures to guarantee a good fieldwork performance were recommended. This comprehensive overview aims to provide scientists, EU officials, partners and stakeholders involved in the EU implementation process full transparency of the work carried out in COPHES. Thus this report presents the discussion and consensus in COPHES on the main aspects of designing and conducting fieldwork of a human biomonitoring study. Furthermore, it provides an example for a systematic approach that may be useful to other research groups or pan-European research initiatives. In the study protocol that will be published elsewhere these aspects are elaborated and additional aspects are covered (Casteleyn et al., 2012).

What I look back at with amazement is the {{situation}} I <b>accepted.</b> I had <b>undertaken,</b> with my companion, to see it out, and I was under a charm, apparently, that could smooth away the extent and the far and difficult connections of such an effort. I was lifted aloft on a great wave of infatuation and pity. I found it simple, in my ignorance, my confusion, and perhaps my conceit, to assume that I could deal with a boy whose education for the world was all on the point of beginning. I am unable even to remember at this day what proposal I framed for the end of his holidays and the resumption of his studies. Lessons with me, indeed, that charming summer, we all had a theory that he was to have; but I now feel that, for weeks, the lessons must have been rather my own. I learned something--at first, certainly--that had not been one of the teachings of my small, smothered life; learned to be amused, and even amusing, and not to think for the morrow. It was the first time, in a manner, that I had known space and air and freedom, all the music of summer and all the mystery of nature. And then there was consideration--and consideration was sweet. Oh, it was a trap--not designed, but deep--to my imagination, to my delicacy, perhaps to my vanity; to whatever, in me, was most excitable. The best way to picture it all is to say that I was off my guard. They gave me so little trouble--they were of a gentleness so extraordinary. I used to speculate--but even this with a dim disconnectedness--as to how the rough future (for all futures are rough!) would handle them and might bruise them. They had the bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as if I had been in charge of a pair of little grandees, of princes of the blood, for whom everything, to be right, would have to be enclosed and protected, the only form that, in my fancy, the afteryears could take for them was that of a romantic, a really royal extension of the garden and the park. It may be, of course, above all, that what suddenly broke into this gives the previous time a charm of stillness--that hush in which something gathers or crouches. The change was actually like the spring of a beast.|$|R
40|$|U svezi sa štetama nastalim u regatnom jedrenju jedno od temeljnih pitanja jest ocjena protupravnosti. Regatno jedrenje je posebno uređeno Regatnim pravilima Međunarodne jedriličarske federacije (ISAF) priznatim od strane nacionalnih jedriličarskih saveza. S obzirom na to da Regatna pravila nisu donesena u zakonodavnoj proceduri, postavlja se pitanje u kojoj mjeri i koga obvezuju, odnosno predstavljaju li dio pravnog poretka na način da se ponašanje protivno njima ocjenjuje protupravnim. Regatna pravila na području regate i za vrijeme njenog trajanja najčešće zamjenjuju opća plovidbena pravila u odnosu na druge sudionike regate. Regatna pravila ne derogiraju primjenu općih plovidbenih pravila. Nisu samostalna općeobvezujuća pravna pravila i tijela državne vlasti primijenit će ih u svezi odgovornosti za štetu nastalu pri jedriličarskim regatama samo kao dodatni kriterij koji će omogućiti ocjenu jesu li postupci štetnika bili protupravni. Sudionik regate dužan je upoznati se s tipičnim opasnostima i rizicima regatnog jedrenja. Pristanak na rizik zapravo je pristanak na poduzimanje radnje koja može izazvati štetu. Takav pristanak isključuje protupravnost radnje koja je obuhvaćena pristankom, a protupravnost je jedna od pretpostavaka odgovornosti za štetu i njezin nedostatak štetnika oslobađa odgovornosti. Pristanak na poduzimanje radnje koja može izazvati štetu, kao očitovanje volje, mora zadovoljavati sve pretpostavke koje se traže za valjano izražavanje pravno relevantne volje. To očitovanje volje daje se najčešće konkludentno samim dobrovoljnim sudjelovanjem u regati. One of {{the basic}} issues {{connected}} with damages occurring during sailing regattas is the assessment of illegality. Sailing rules for safe navigation in territorial seas and on inland waters are laid down in the Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, and for open sea navigation by the Convention on International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (IRPCAS). Observance of these regulations is obligatory for any navigators. Sailing regattas are separately regulated by the Regatta Rules of the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) recognised by the national sailing federation, including the Croatian Sailing Federation. However, since the Regatta Rules have not been adopted according to a legislative procedure, the question arises as to what extent and for whom they are binding, or whether they constitute {{a part of the}} legal order so that their violation is considered illegal. The Regatta Rules belong to the category of sports rules. The regulation of sports does not fall within the primary interest of public authority. From the viewpoint of a state, sports are considered as a subsidiary activity left to the corresponding sports organisations recognised by the state as national federations of particular sports. Regatta sailing is thus regulated by the Regatta Rules of the International Sailing Federation, also recognised by the Croatian Sailing Federation as a sports organisation authorised by public authority for sailing activities. Sport is of great importance for the social community and its importance in Croatia is proclaimed in the Constitution. The importance of sports is also proclaimed {{at the level of the}} Council of Europe and the European Union by the European Sports Charter and the Declaration on the Specific Characteristics of Sport and its Social Function in Europe. Sailing is a sport which is undoubtedly of immense social importance. The Regatta Rules applied to the area where a regatta is held and for its duration are a substitution for the general navigation rules applied to all other participants in a regatta (unless there are particular regatta instructions issued by the regatta committee specifying that the general rules are applied). Public authority tolerates the derogation of its own coercive rules because it has recognised sailing competitions as being of special social importance not specifically regulated by public authority. This tolerance applies only to regattas and those who voluntarily participate in them. Therefore, in the case of sailing boats not taking part in a regatta or encountering those which do participate, the Regatta Rules do not derogate the application of general navigation rules. The sailing regatta rules are part of the legal order (just like the rules of other recognised sports) and have their specific place within the legal order. They do not constitute independent, generally binding legal rules, and the bodies of state authority will refer to them in cases of liability for damages occurring during sailing regattas only as an additional criterion to assess the conduct of a wrongdoer as a member of society in order to establish whether the conduct during a regatta has been illegal or not. Risk is a constituent part of sailing activity. A certain level of sailing risk must be accepted by all those who voluntarily and freely decide to participate in it. Therefore, they must also accept the possibility of damages occurring during a sailing competition. In principle, consent to risk operates within the limits which the participants in a regatta have accepted when informed about the possible consequences. Every participant must acquaint himself or herself with the basic rules of sailing in a regatta and with the knowledge of at least some typical dangers that can be expected by a good seaman in any type of navigation. Having accepted the risk, they also <b>accept</b> to <b>undertake</b> various acts which may cause damages. Such acceptance excludes the illegality of an act comprised by consent (volenti non fit iniuria), and illegality is one of the preconditions for liability for damages. In the absence of such illegal acts, a wrongdoer is exempted from such liability. The consent to undertake an act which may result in some damage is a legally relevant declaration of will and must, therefore, satisfy all the preconditions required by a legal order for a valid expression of the legally relevant will.
