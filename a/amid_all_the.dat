She was subsequently charged with extortion and violation of Section 145 of the Federal Criminal Code. George W.

Gibson was also said {{to be connected to}} two convicted blackmailers who had pleaded guilty the preceding week to extorting $10,000 from Ohio banker John L. Bushnell. <b>Amid</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> publicity following her arrest she was mentioned as both Margaret Gibson and Patricia Palmer. The charges were later dropped by the district attorney's office. Over the next six years she worked sporadically in bit parts and minor supporting roles but the industry's transition to sound film saw the end of Gibson's already thwarted career.|$|E

The period surrounding Yokos conception and recording was one of great personal strife for the band - Kurosky separated from his longtime girlfriend, {{and three of the}} six band members went through divorce while the record was being written, rehearsed and recorded. <b>Amid</b> <b>all</b> this, <b>the</b> foundations of the band appeared to be shaking; rumours of a break-up were rife and well-founded. The mood of the album was certainly much darker and the band phased back much of their instrumentation, preferring to create more of a live sound than layering multiple overdubs atop the mix. The album took a much rockier direction than their previous efforts; yet, upon its release in 2003, attracted a similar lauding that had greeted their previous two records. An album of demos, appropriately titled Yoko Demos, was released in the December of this year.|$|R
