Yet, there have been recent claims [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] that electromagnetic waves from a bounded source can be generated whose amplitude falls off as 1 / √ r over portions of solid angle in far zone. Mathematically, there exist cylindrical waves whose amplitude falls off as 1 / √ ρ,whereρ is the radial distance in a cylindrical coordinate system whose axis is the axis of symmetry of the source, which latter has infinite extent along the axis. An example is Čerenkov radiation; however, the amplitude of Čerenkov radiation from a finite path length falls off as 1 /r for r large compared to the path length [7]. Also, mathematical plane waves, whose amplitude is independent of distance only their direction of propagation, can be generated by sources of infinite extent in the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

The calculation uses {{the method of}} generating functions first developed for polyatomic Franck-Condon factors by Sharp and Rosenstock [J. Chem. Phys. 41 (11), 3453 – 3463 (1964) ], and previously applied to acetylene by Watson [J. Mol. Spectrosc. 207 (2), 276 – 284 (2001) ] in a reduced-dimension calculation. Because the transition involves a large change in the equilibrium geometry of the electronic states, {{two different types of}} corrections to the coordinate transformation are considered to first order: corrections for axis-switching between the Cartesian molecular frames and corrections for the curvilinear nature of the normal modes at large amplitude. The <b>angular</b> <b>factor</b> in the wavefunction for the out-of-plane component of the trans bending mode, ν[′′ over 4], is treated as a rotation, which results in an Eckart constraint on the polar coordinates of the bending modes. To simplify the calculation, the other degenerate bending mode, ν[′′ over 5], is integrated in the Cartesian basis and later transformed to the constrained polar coordinate basis, restoring the conventional v and l quantum numbers. An updated [~ over A]-state harmonic force field obtained recently in the R. W. Field research group is evaluated. The results for transitions involving the gerade vibrational modes are in qualitative agreement with experiment.
