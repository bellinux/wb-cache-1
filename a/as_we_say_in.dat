2500|$|Next morning, Thursday, Sasun Eff. {{came in at}} 10; I {{took him}} {{straight}} to Sir Percy and left them. Half an hour later, he returned {{and told me that}} he had accepted and I understood the full significance of the Nunc Dimittis. He asked me what he could now do to help and I sent him straight to the Naqib. The leading Shi'ah of Baghdad had also refused to join the Council and it was essential to get him in. In the midst of this talk Sir Percy sent for me. I left Sasun to Mr Philby and went to consult with Sir Percy. We agreed that I should send at once for Ja'far, tell him what had happened and bid him bestir himself. It was past one o'clock before I caught Ja'far. We had the most extraordinary conversation. He told me he had come into the Cabinet, only to defeat Talib, that he distrusted and loathed him and regarded it as shameful that he should be one of the leading persons of Mesopotamia. I said that the Mesopotamians themselves had made him, by their fear and their servility, and that it was for them to unmake him if they wished. We then discussed how to win over the extremists, I assured him that that was Sir Percy's chief desire and taking heart, he asked if he might talk to Sir Percy. I took him at once to Sir Percy and left them together, with the assured conviction that Sir Percy was the best exponent of his own policy.”… “Oh, if we can pull this thing off! rope together the young hotheads, and the Shi'ah obscurantists, and enthusiasts like Ja'far, polished old statesmen like Sasun, and scholars like Shukri—if we can make them work together and find their own salvation for themselves, what a fine thing it will be. I see visions and dream dreams. But <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> Arabic countless times a day [...] "Through the presence of His Excellency the Representative of the King, and with the help of the Great Government, all please God, must be well!" ...|$|E

5000|$|The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy summarises the {{distinction}} between merit and source like so: [...] "The fact that a policy would be just, wise, efficient, or prudent is never sufficient reason for thinking that it is actually the law, {{and the fact that}} it is unjust, unwise, inefficient or imprudent is never sufficient reason for doubting it. According to positivism, law is a matter of what has been posited (ordered, decided, practiced, tolerated, etc.); <b>as</b> <b>we</b> might <b>say</b> <b>in</b> a more modern idiom, positivism is the view that law is a social construction." ...|$|R

"No, Jeanie, {{that would}} not have the same effect--that would be like reading a sermon, you know, which we good Presbyterians think has less unction than when spoken without book," [...] replied the Duke.

40|$|Session {{contracts}} is a formalism enabling {{to investigate}} client/server interaction protocols and to interpret session types. We extend session contracts {{in order to}} represent outputs whose actual sending in an interaction depends on a third party or on a mutual agreement between the partners. Such contracts are hence adaptable, or <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> "affectible". <b>In</b> client/server systems, in general, compliance stands for the satisfaction of all client's requests by the server. We define an abstract notion of "affectible compliance" and show it to have a precise three-party game-theoretic interpretation. This in turn is shown to be equivalent to a compliance based on interactions that can undergo a sequence of failures and rollbacks, {{as well as to}} a compliance based on interactions which can be mediated by an orchestrator. Besides, there is a one-to-one effective correspondence between winning strategies and orchestrators. The relation of subcontract for affectible contracts is also investigated...|$|R
