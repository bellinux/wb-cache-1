2500|$|The Titanic indeed had a [...] list to port leaving Southampton. [...] Inadequate {{trimming}} {{of cargo}} and bunkers would likely result in such {{and the crew}} seems to have demonstrated a lack of proficiency on several occasions. [...] A list to port was noted by several Titanic survivors including Lawrence Beesley who wrote in his book about the sinking: [...] "I then called the attention of our table {{to the way the}} Titanic listed to port (I had noticed this before), and we watched the skyline through the portholes <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> at the purser's table in the saloon." [...] (The dining saloon windows were double rows of portholes covered on the inside with screens of leaded decorative glass with no clear view of the outdoors.) [...] This was echoed by [...] survivor Norman Chambers, who testified that after the collision: [...] "However, there was then a slight list to starboard, with probably a few degrees in pitch; and as the ship had a list to port nearly all afternoon, I decided to remain up." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I really {{believed}} in the horse. I was going so fast in the last 300 metres I knew no other horse would pass me. I had the best horse and I wanted to show how good he is. His record is unbelievable and he {{is probably the best}} horse I have ridden". Gosden, who was winning the race for the first time said [...] "It's great to win the Arc in France and the Derby in England - that's what it's about. When you're drawn wide, if you stay wide for a long time, you can run your own little race and not be bothered by anyone and then slot across. It was perfect <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> behind the pacemaker and then kicked because as Frankie says, if you don't kick at a certain time here they come like arrows at your back". He also suggested that the horse might make a final appearance in the Breeders' Cup Turf, saying [...] "The owner is keen on the Breeders' Cup. It's a month away. If he's in good order, there's no reason we couldn't go there".|$|E
60|$|Then <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> {{in silence}} {{there came a}} low tapping at the door. Ray looked at me keenly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pray {{how long}} have they taken little imps like thee into their counsels?' demanded Eustace, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> all <b>sat</b> petrified at this announcement.|$|R
60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> {{again and}} ate and drank, {{in a place}} whence {{we could see the}} sun going down into a field of great, wild, and {{houseless}} mountains, such as I was now condemned to wander in with my companion. Partly <b>as</b> <b>we</b> so <b>sat,</b> and partly afterwards, on the way to Aucharn, each of us narrated his adventures; and I shall here set down so much of Alan's as seems either curious or needful.|$|R
6000|$|When we all {{had seen}} it fully, Mr. Trelawny turned it over so that it rested on its back in a cavity made {{to hold it in}} the upper half of the box. The reverse was no less {{wonderful}} than the upper, being carved to resemble the under side of the beetle. It, too, had some hieroglyphic figures cut on it. Mr. Trelawny resumed his lecture <b>as</b> <b>we</b> all <b>sat</b> with our heads close to this wonderful jewel: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Ah!' {{says the}} heedless little thing, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> over our dessert, ''tis lucky for you, Mr. Esmond, that Captain Harry is not here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The next day, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down to Dinner," [...] our Host in {{the above}} shining costume, [...] "he said, in English tolerably pronounced:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{should think}} not. Here! one stew; and be quick, please,' cried John, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> {{down in a}} warm corner of the confectioner's opposite.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yet we have {{years to}} count by, too, since Marion was with us,' {{returned}} Grace. 'Six times, dear husband, counting to-night <b>as</b> one, <b>we</b> have <b>sat</b> here on her birth-day, and spoken together of that happy return, so eagerly expected and so long deferred. Ah when will it be! When will it be!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And all at once, <b>as</b> there <b>we</b> <b>sat,</b> <b>we</b> heard [...] A {{cracking}} and a riving of the roofs, [...] And rending, and a blast, {{and overhead}} [...] Thunder, {{and in the}} thunder was a cry. [...] And in the blast there smote along the hall [...] A beam of light seven times more clear than day: [...] And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail [...] All over covered with a luminous cloud. [...] And none might see who bare it, and it past. [...] But every knight beheld his fellow's face [...] As in a glory, and all the knights arose, [...] And staring each at other like dumb men [...] Stood, till I found a voice and sware a vow.|$|R
6000|$|... "We may stop here, and die of {{asphyxiation}} {{when our}} atmosphere tanks are empty," [...] replied Perry, [...] "or we may continue {{on with the}} slight hope that we may later sufficiently deflect the prospector from the vertical to carry us along the arc of a great circle which must eventually return us to the surface. If we succeed in so doing before we reach the higher internal temperature we may even yet survive. There {{would seem to me}} to be about one chance in several million that we shall succeed--otherwise we shall die more quickly but no more surely than <b>as</b> though <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> supinely waiting for the torture of a slow and horrible death." ...|$|R
60|$|I felt {{proud of}} myself <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down to the table. My words had been decisive. At least they had {{put an end to}} the discussion.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down {{to breakfast}} he loped {{off into the}} forest and before we got up the bells of the horses were {{jingling}} in the hollow.|$|E
60|$|Now, my father, {{for awhile}} we were silent and {{alone in the}} hut, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> I thought I heard a rat stir in the thatch.|$|E
6000|$|William, {{a skilled}} bee-man, {{described}} to us his methods of tracking wild swarms, {{and told us}} how he handled those in his hives. [...] "I can scoop 'em up {{as if they were}} so many kernels of corn," [...] he said. After supper <b>as</b> <b>we</b> all <b>sat</b> on the porch watching the sunset, he reverted to the brave days of fifty-five when deer and bear came down over the hills, when a rifle was almost as necessary as a hoe, and as he talked I revived in him the black-haired smiling young giant of my boyhood days, untouched of age or care.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{very quietly}} glad evening, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> three <b>sat</b> round the open window, and asked and {{answered}} questions. Harold said {{he would come to}} the wedding with me the next day; he must see old Eu married; and, besides, he wanted to give up to him the three nuggets, which had been rather a serious charge. Harold, Prometesky, and Dermot had each carried one, in case of any disaster, that there might be three chances; but now they were all three laid in my lap--wonderful things, one a little larger than the others, but all curiously apple-like in form, such gifts as a bride has seldom had.|$|R
60|$|It {{was on the}} gun-deck {{that our}} dinners were spread; all along between the guns; and there, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> cross-legged <b>sat,</b> {{you would have thought}} a hundred farm-yards and meadows were nigh. Such a cackling of ducks, chickens, and ganders; such a lowing of oxen, and bleating of lambkins, penned up here and there along the deck, to provide sea repasts for the officers. More rural than naval were the sounds; {{continually}} reminding each mother's son of the old paternal homestead in the green old clime; the old arching elms; the hill where we gambolled; and down by the barley banks of the stream where we bathed.|$|R
60|$|But that night, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> {{before the}} fading red of the backlog, {{the old man}} dozing in his chair, Polly Ann {{put her hand on}} mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "You've had swell callers again," [...] she remarked, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> {{side by side}} at supper-time. [...] "A {{carriage}} from Rowchester {{was outside}} your door when I passed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And when, Trot,' said my aunt, {{patting the}} back of my hand, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> in our old way before the fire, 'when are you going over to Canterbury?' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{old lady}} was as {{impatient}} of doctors as of divines; pretending {{that my wife}} was ailing, {{and that it was}} more convenient for our good Doctor Heberden to visit her in Clarges Street than to travel all the way to our Lambeth lodgings, we got Dr. H. to see Theo at our aunt's house, and prayed him if possible to offer his advice to the Baroness: we made Mrs. Brett, her woman, describe her ailments, and the doctor confirmed our opinion that they were most serious, and might speedily end. She would rally briskly enough of some evenings, and entertain a little company; but of late she scarcely went abroad at all. A somnolence, which we had remarked in her, was attributable in part to opiates which she was in the habit of taking; and she used these narcotics to smother habitual pain. One night, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> two <b>sat</b> with her (Mr. Miles was weaned by this time, and his mother could leave him to the charge of our faithful Molly), she fell asleep over her cards. We hushed the servants who came to lay out the supper-table (she would always have this luxurious, nor could any injunction of ours or the Doctor's teach her abstinence), and <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> a while <b>as</b> <b>we</b> had often done before, waiting in silence till she should arouse from her doze.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> by the fire, cooking such food <b>as</b> <b>we</b> had, {{and talked}} and smoked; then I sang her songs in Spanish with that melody of my own-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And he's always late to breakfast," [...] said Mrs. Petter; [...] "I {{believe if}} <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> {{down at the}} table at nine o'clock he would come in just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were finishing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's {{just as we}} said,' she {{remarked to}} me <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> there. 'It is like the bucket in the well. When I come up that girl goes down.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} back again to your own country, Ivanka," [...] said I, gently {{stroking}} the child's head, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> {{together in the same}} room, some hours later.|$|E
6000|$|... "He went {{round with}} the wineskin, and filled our cups just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down to breakfast," [...] {{one of the}} men said. [...] "I have not noticed him since." ...|$|E
40|$|PDDL+ {{planning}} involves reasoning about mixed discrete-continuous {{change over}} time. Nearly all PDDL+ planners assume that continuous change is linear. We present {{a new technique}} that accommodates nonlinear change by encod-ing problems as nonlinear hybrid systems. Using this encod-ing, we apply a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver to find plans. We show {{that it is important}} to use a novel planning-specific heuristic for variable selection for SMT solving, which is inspired by recent advances in planning <b>as</b> <b>SAT.</b> <b>We</b> show the promising performance of the resulting solver on challenging nonlinear problems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{two ways}} to transform propositional clauses into mathematical constraints, and gives an overview of mathematical optimization approaches to inference. The first transformation, which translates constraints into linear inequalities, {{has been applied to}} cost-based abduction in the past and showed good performance. The second one, which produces nonlinear equalities, is commonly used in other representations, such <b>as</b> <b>SAT.</b> <b>We</b> clarify their differences and advantages, and show the radical performance transition of linear inequalities. We are mainly targeting at cost-based hypothetical reasoning (or abduction), but through preprocessing, the discussion has generality...|$|R
6000|$|I {{that evening}} {{shut my eyes}} resolutely against the future: I stopped my cars against the voice that kept warning me of near {{separation}} and coming grief. When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I had assumed a low seat near her, and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had nestled close up to me, {{and a sense of}} mutual affection seemed to surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that we might not be parted far or soon; but when, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> thus <b>sat,</b> Mr. Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he said he supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted daughter back again, and added that he saw Adele was [...] "prete a croquer sa petite maman Anglaise"--I half ventured to hope that he would, even after his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{just as we}} said," [...] she {{remarked to}} me <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> there. [...] "It's like the buckets in the well. When I come up {{everything}} else goes down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excellent sir," [...] said I, [...] "I have;" [...] {{and that}} very evening, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> over our cups of tertullia (sangaree), I {{continued}} my narrative in nearly the following words:- ...|$|E
6000|$|Christmas Eve, {{and twelve}} of the clock. [...] "Now they are all on their knees," [...] An elder said <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> in a flock [...] By the embers in hearthside ease.|$|E
6000|$|Over in Lorraine, meanwhile, they of the {{distributed}} fusils, ringleaders of Mestre-de-Camp, of Roi, {{have got}} marked out for judgment;--yet shall never get judged. Briefer is the doom of Chateau-Vieux. Chateau-Vieux is, by Swiss law, {{given up for}} instant trial in Court-Martial of its own officers. Which Court-Martial, with all brevity (in not many hours), has hanged some Twenty-three, on conspicuous gibbets; marched some Three-score in chains to the Galleys; and so, to appearance, finished the matter off. Hanged men do cease for ever from this Earth; but out of chains and the Galleys there may be resuscitation in triumph. Resuscitation for the chained Hero; and even for the chained Scoundrel, or Semi-scoundrel! Scottish John Knox, such World-Hero, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know, <b>sat</b> once nevertheless pulling grim-taciturn at the oar of French Galley, 'in the Water of Lore;' and even flung their Virgin-Mary over, instead of kissing her,--as 'a pented bredd,' or timber Virgin, who could naturally swim. (Knox's History of the Reformation, b. i.) So, ye of Chateau-Vieux, tug patiently, not without hope! ...|$|R
60|$|Five {{minutes longer}} on the ice of the main channel, {{and we should have}} been swept away. Even <b>as</b> <b>we</b> still <b>sat</b> looking at the frightful force of the swift current, as well as the dim light of that clouded night would permit, I saw Guert Ten Eyck's sleigh whirl past us; and, only a minute later, Herman Mordaunt's followed; the poor, {{exhausted}} beasts struggling in the harness for freedom, that they might swim for their lives. Anneke heard the snorting of those wretched horses; but her unpractised eyes did not detect them, immersed, as they were, in the current; nor had she recognised the sleigh that whirled past us, as her father's. A little later, a fearful shriek came from one of the fettered beasts; such a heart-piercing cry as it is known the horse often gives. I said nothing on the subject, knowing that love for her father {{was one of the great}} incentives which had aroused my companion to exertion; and being unwilling to excite fears that were now latent.|$|R
60|$|It {{was getting}} quite dark. The {{conductor}} came {{and said that}} there was no more paraffin. If what there was in the lamps gave out, we should have to sit in the dark. There was no more paraffin all along the line.--So he climbed on the seats, and after a long struggle, with various boys striking matches for him, he managed to obtain a light as big <b>as</b> a pea. <b>We</b> <b>sat</b> in this clair-obscur, and looked at the sombre-shadowed faces round us: the fat soldier with a gun, the handsome soldier with huge saddle-bags, the weird, dark little man who kept exchanging a baby with a solid woman who had a white cloth tied round her head, a tall peasant-woman in costume, who darted out at a dark station and returned triumphant with a piece of chocolate: a young and interested young man, who told us every station. And the man who spat: there is always one.|$|R
