5|$|In {{the first}} book, Blair is {{introduced}} as a privileged, comically vain overachiever. She {{is described as}} an <b>alluring</b> brunette, and occasionally models her appearance and demeanor after famous actresses, including Marilyn Monroe and, most often, Audrey Hepburn. In early novels, the character is also written as bulimic.|$|E

5|$|Despite her mixed {{critical}} reception, Ariel remains {{popular with}} audiences {{and is considered}} one of Disney's most iconic animated characters, with her specific color combination of red hair, lavender seashells and green tail making her distinctly identifiable. A poll in the Internet Movie Database showed Ariel to be the second most <b>alluring</b> animated character after Jessica Rabbit. In August 2011, Jodi Benson was honored with a Disney Legend for her work as Ariel and her other projects at Disney.|$|E
25|$|Stacking {{was well}} {{received}} by critics and praised for its <b>alluring</b> appearance, humorous story, and accessible gameplay for casual players.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the poem}} Lalla Radha and The Churel, {{she takes the}} form of a lovely woman with <b>alluring</b> eyes but her {{appearance}} is marred by her backward turned feet.|$|E
25|$|The clothing, use of cosmetics, and mannerisms of a cinaedus marked him as effeminate, but {{the same}} effeminacy that Roman men might find <b>alluring</b> in a puer became unattractive in the {{physically}} mature male. The cinaedus thus represented the absence of what Romans considered true manhood, and the word is virtually untranslatable into English.|$|E
25|$|While such games {{could also}} be played with {{counters}} on a table with colored paper to denote terrain types, the visual attractiveness and tactile satisfaction of painted miniatures moving around on a table with model trees, hills and other scenery has such an <b>alluring</b> power to convince many wargamers to prefer model/miniature games over the cheaper and easier board-and-chits alternatives.|$|E
25|$|With a {{standard}} flash drive, social engineering attacks {{can be employed}} to entice a user to click on the appropriate item in the AutoPlay dialog. An <b>alluring</b> action string promising free games or pornography would lure many users into the trap. At any time, double clicking on the drive icon will use the autorun.inf automatically, a trap more advanced users could fall into.|$|E
25|$|The anal sphincters {{are usually}} tighter than the pelvic {{muscles of the}} vagina, which can enhance the sexual {{pleasure}} for the inserting male during male-to-female anal intercourse because of the pressure applied to the penis. Men may also enjoy the penetrative role during anal sex because of its association with dominance, because it is made more <b>alluring</b> by a female partner or society in general insisting that it is forbidden, or because it presents an additional option for penetration.|$|E
25|$|The chuánqí of the Tang period {{frequently}} use incidental poems, {{set their}} {{story in the}} national capital, finish with an instructive moral, and are narrated by someone {{who claims to have}} seen the events himself. One of the most widely read of these stories was Yuan Zhen's Story of Yingying, concerning the romance of a young scholar and an <b>alluring</b> young lady. This story helped to establish the genre of Caizi jiaren (Scholar and beautiful lady).|$|E
25|$|After the October Revolution Shukhov {{decided to}} stay in the Soviet Union despite having {{received}} <b>alluring</b> job offers from around the world. Many signal Soviet engineering projects of the 1920s were associated with his name. In 1919 he framed his slogan: We should work independently from politics. The buildings, boilers, beams would be needed and so would we. In the later 1930s during the Great Purge he retired from engineering work but was not arrested or persecuted.|$|E
25|$|Stone Arthur can be climbed {{directly}} up {{the steep}} ridge from the village, although the depth of bracken combined with the gradient do not make the prospect particularly <b>alluring.</b> The summit can also be reached from {{either side of the}} ridge. Beginning at Mill Bridge, Tongue Gill can be followed until the footbridge, before making a pathless ascent on grass. From Grasmere, Greenhead Gill also provides access, climbing until a contouring traverse to the summit can be made.|$|E
25|$|Albertus, {{written in}} 1831 and {{published}} in 1832, is a long narrative poem of 122 stanzas, each consisting of 12 lines of alexandrine (12-syllable) verse, except for {{the last line of}} each stanza, which is octosyllabic. Albertus is a parody of Romantic literature, especially of tales of the macabre and the supernatural. The poem tells a story of an ugly witch who magically transforms at midnight into an <b>alluring</b> young woman. Albertus, the hero, falls deeply in love and agrees to sell his soul.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{critics have}} pointed out that Colbert had a mixture of unique {{physical}} assets (her round apple-face, big eyes, curly hair, slender body), an elegant voice, aristocratic manner, relaxed acting, a tongue-in-cheek vivacity, intelligent style, comedic timing and ladylike <b>alluring</b> charm, that distinguishes her from other screwball comediennes of the 1930s. In her comedy films, she invariably played shrewd and self-reliant women, but unlike many of her contemporaries, Colbert rarely engaged in physical comedy. Her characters {{were more likely to be}} observers and commentators.|$|E
25|$|Lodge’s gifts as an expounder of {{knowledge}} {{were of a}} high order, and few scientific men {{have been able to}} set forth abstruse facts in a more lucid or engaging form… Those who heard him on a great occasion, as when he gave his Romanes lecture at Oxford or his British Association presidential address at Birmingham, were charmed by his <b>alluring</b> personality as well as impressed by the orderly development of his thesis. But he was even better in informal debate, and when he rose, the audience, however perplexed or jaded, settled down in a pleased expectation that was never disappointed.|$|E
25|$|Penderel Moon simply {{attributes}} the League's {{rise to power}} to the <b>alluring</b> and irresistible appeal of the Pakistan cry to the Muslim masses. Peter Hardy's explained that the Muslim League gained its electoral success in the Punjab by making a religious appeal {{over the heads of}} the professional politicians. Pakistani historians have explained the League's success in the Punjab, as elsewhere in the subcontinent, solely in terms of the Two Nation Theory. Whatever the historians may suggest, one thing is clear that League's success was due to the political vision, farsightedness of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He was a man of high personal integrity and intelligence who became a Grandmaster of the game by his clever, and clever calculations.|$|E
25|$|New Approach, a {{chestnut}} colt {{with a white}} {{star and}} snip was bred by the Lodge Park Stud in Kilkenny Ireland from the second crop of the 2002 Epsom Derby winner Galileo. His dam was the Irish Champion Stakes winner Park Express, making him a half-brother to the Takamatsunomiya Kinen winner Shinko Forest Dazzling Park (by Warning), Champion three-year-old filly in Europe and <b>Alluring</b> Park, the dam of The Oaks winner Was. He was first owned by Mrs J S Bolger & John Corcoran. He was bought in training by Sheikh Mohammed, who presented the colt to his wife Princess Haya of Jordan. He was trained throughout his career by Jim Bolger and ridden in all his starts by Kevin Manning.|$|E
25|$|Sargent was {{a lifelong}} {{bachelor}} {{with a wide}} circle of friends. Biographers once portrayed him as staid and reticent. However recent scholarship has suggested {{that he was a}} private, complex and passionate man with a homosexual identity that shaped his art. This view is based on his friends and associations; the overall <b>alluring</b> remoteness of his portraits; the way his works challenge 19th-century notions of gender difference; his erotic and previously ignored male nudes; and some sensitive and erotic male portraits, including those of Thomas E. McKeller, Bartholomy Maganosco, Olimpio Fusco, and that of the handsome aristocratic artist Albert de Belleroche, which hung in his Chelsea dining room. Sargent had a long and intense romantic friendship with Belleroche, whom he met in 1882, and who later went on to marry: a surviving drawing hints that Sargent may have used him as a model for Madame X.|$|E
25|$|Joshua Slocum {{was born}} in the family's farm house in Mount Hanley and learned to read and write at the nearby Mount Hanley School. His {{earliest}} ventures on the water were made on coastal schooners operating out of the small ports such as Port George and Cottage Cove near Mount Hanley along the Bay of Fundy. When Joshua was eight years old, the Slocombe family moved from Mount Hanley to Brier Island in Digby County, {{at the mouth of the}} Bay of Fundy. Slocum's maternal grandfather was the keeper of the lighthouse at Southwest Point there. His father, a stern man and strict disciplinarian, took up making leather boots for the local fishermen, and Joshua helped in the shop. However, the boy found the scent of salt air much more <b>alluring</b> than the smell of shoe leather. He yearned for a life of adventure at sea, away from his demanding father and his increasingly chaotic life at home among so many brothers and sisters.|$|E
25|$|Myiasis is {{the leading}} entomological {{evidence}} used to prove abuse, and neglect in animals. Leading causes of myiasis in animals occur {{when there is an}} injury or the presence of excretory material, making the living animal <b>alluring</b> to insects. The following characteristics have to be present for myiasis to happen in a pet animal. There has to be abuse or neglect that causes an injury with blood, decaying tissue, feces or urine that attracts flies and the animals must be fairly helpless or incapable of cleaning itself. In long-coated animals, matts and burrs can cause irritation which leads to hot spots, scratching, open lacerations, and infestation. Animals with long mats and coats are especially prone to the building of excrement around the genital area. This circumstance worsens when the animal is elderly or hindered and can no longer clean itself. Risk factors are further intensified if the animals spends most of its life outdoors and is vulnerable to the external environments. Regular grooming and check-ups can significantly reduce these risks. In addition, eliminating other fly attractants, such as uneaten food and fecal matter, can also reduce risks. The summer season is when the highest risk occurs because insects are more common during this time.|$|E
25|$|Season two {{begins with}} the end of summer school. Naomi unknowingly dates a married man in an attempt to get over Liam, who shows up at West Beverly {{on the first day of}} school after being absent for the entire summer. Silver and Dixon get back together, but break up when he finds out Silver kissed Ethan. It is also {{revealed}} that Ethan has decided to stay in Montana with his father.

Sasha finally learns about Dixon's real age when Debbie accidentally shows Sasha, whom she met by chance in a salon and does not know, a picture of her son Dixon who is only in high school.|$|E
500|$|His own {{reaction}} was positive. [...] "Doctor Ox was aurally <b>alluring,</b> with {{a row of}} lyrical ideas flowering from a Straussian seed-bed and just enough drama to justify the stage business – but I was there to enjoy, not review." ...|$|E
500|$|The obituarist for The Musical Times {{wrote that}} [...] "Ketèlbey's especial fame... {{consisted}} in his phenomenal {{success as a}} composer of light music. His remarkable gift for <b>alluring</b> tunes, rich in homely sentiment, {{was reflected in the}} immense popularity of [...] pieces". McCanna opines that Ketèlbey's popularity ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{characters}} depict a particular {{range of social}} types: the noble soldier, the scoundrel, the proud workman, the fearless spy, the <b>alluring</b> mistress. That Balzac was able to balance {{the strength of the}} individual against the representation of the type is evidence of the author's skill. One critic explained that [...] "there is a center and a circumference to Balzac's world".|$|E
500|$|According to Sukhdev Sandhu of The Telegraph, [...] "Let Me In doesn't need {{to exist}} unless, that is, {{the very notion}} of Swedish cinema is strange and {{unpalatable}} to you… What's missing is the <b>alluring</b> otherness of Let the Right One In. That film's brittle textures and haunted ambiance seemed in some strange way to have sprung organically from the nation in which it was set. This remake, by contrast, smells of boardrooms and calculating machines." ...|$|E
500|$|Klingsor's magic castle. Klingsor {{conjures up}} Kundry, waking {{her from her}} sleep. He calls her by many names: First Sorceress (...) , Hell's Rose (...) , Herodias, Gundryggia and, lastly, Kundry. She is now {{transformed}} into an incredibly <b>alluring</b> woman, as when she once seduced Amfortas. She mocks Klingsor's mutilated condition by sarcastically inquiring if he is chaste (""), but she cannot resist his power. Klingsor observes that Parsifal is approaching and summons his enchanted knights to fight the boy. Klingsor watches as Parsifal overcomes his knights, and they flee. Klingsor wishes destruction on their whole race.|$|E
500|$|... "Freakum Dress" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Beyoncé from her second solo studio album B'Day (2006). It was written by Beyoncé, Rich Harrison, and Makeba Riddick. [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] is similar to songs that Destiny's Child used to record in the 1990s. The song is complete with whistles, cymbal dominated scatter rhythms and a beat, which is augmented by hi-hats and plinking keyboard pulses. In the song, Beyoncé advises women who have partners with straying eyes to put on <b>alluring</b> dresses and grind on other guys in dance clubs, to regain their affections.|$|E
500|$|At {{the lowest}} point of their career, the duo put {{together}} a nightclub routine that relied on a more adult approach to sound and style. According to writer Cintra Wilson, [...] "Their lounge act was so depressing, people started heckling them. Then Cher started heckling back. Sonny... reprimanded her; then she'd heckle Sonny". The heckling became a highlight of the act and attracted viewers. Television executives took note, and the couple began making guest appearances on prime-time shows, in which they presented a [...] "new, sophisticated, and mature" [...] image. Cher adopted <b>alluring,</b> low-cut gowns that became her signature outfits.|$|E
500|$|During development, DeLonge {{often took}} his {{daughter}} Ava to {{an ice cream}} shop in San Diego, and on one occasion they wandered into a next door toy store and DeLonge was enchanted {{by the sound of}} a pink toy piano, which he would eventually purchase. He placed the piano in his shower and recorded [...] "Start the Machine", which attempts to illustrate the state of [...] "being on a boat as you're leaving a city in flames," [...] only to find a tropical island and a more <b>alluring</b> place ahead. DeLonge considered it a reference to his time with Blink-182 and central to Angels & Airwaves' theme that [...] "something special [...] out of destruction." ...|$|E
500|$|Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters {{described}} {{the story as}} [...] "the most surprising of Tintin's adventures", with Hergé having been [...] "determined to push his reexamination of the comic strip even further." [...] He noted that in the story, Castafiore's [...] "dramatic femininity" [...] disrupted the [...] "idea of sociability" [...] that pervaded Marlinspike, with its [...] "proper respect of space, a form of harmony in independence". [...] He added that [...] "this casually <b>alluring</b> tale {{is one of the}} most subtly handled of the adventures; a riot of clues, both real and false, give The Castafiore Emerald an unequaled density", elsewhere referring to it as [...] "a catalogue of mishaps with nothing or no one spared".|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} Madonna {{and her two}} backup dancers dancing in a club while lights blink in the background. The shots {{continue}} while interspersing close-up shots of Madonna dancing while wearing a coat and junk jewelry. Author Douglas Kellner in his book Media Culture: Cultural Studies, Identity, and Politics Between the Modern and the Postmodern noted that already with her first video, Madonna was deploying fashion, sexuality {{and the construction of}} an individual image to present herself both as an <b>alluring</b> sex object and as a transgressor of established norms. The band Fab Five Freddy reminisce that with the video Madonna [...] "is attracting those who were more street, more savvy, more flavorful." ...|$|E
500|$|Much {{attention}} has been paid to Ganguli's image, appearance and personal style [...] by the international media, the British in particular. They continue to paint his profile as an <b>alluring,</b> exotic and enigmatic figure. The editor of the Spectator wrote in his magazine diary that Ganguli reminded him of a cross between Oscar Wilde and Malcolm McLaren while James Collard of The Saturday Times Magazine reported that Pablo Ganguli was a wunderkind and a mystery. He went on to add 'Or even, as Winston Churchill said in an altogether different context, a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.' Words including rare, flamboyant, legendary and fascinating have been used to describe Ganguli.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers {{commented that}} Elsa was more {{interesting}} than Anna, Frozens primary protagonist. ABS-CBN writer Fred Hawson described Elsa as [...] "an incredible character with a unique and interesting predicament because of the powers she possessed" [...] and expressed the opinion that Frozen should {{have focused more on}} her rather than Anna. Samra Muslim of The Express Tribune wrote that it was her presence that kept viewers [...] "hooked" [...] throughout the movie, elaborating, [...] "Her character is complex and sympathetic and deserved to be explored even further. Instead the story revolves more around the relationship of the two sisters and Anna who is the typical, feisty, charming Disney heroine and her love trysts—instead of the <b>alluring</b> Elsa." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{have seen}} Enkyō {{as a student}} and perhaps the sole {{successor}} of Sharaku. [...] There are no records of ukiyo-e artists other than Sharaku and Enkyō making aiban-sized ōkubi-e yakusha-e during the Edo period. [...] The German writer [...] asserted Enkyō was Sharaku, who had assumed a new identity to revive his career. [...] The American Arthur Davison Ficke called this idea [...] "an <b>alluring</b> but somewhat fantastic theory, which neither the documentary nor the internal evidence... adequately supports", and James A. Michener agreed this was a [...] "fanciful theory... but nothing in the artistic content of Kabukidō's prints supports this wild guess", though [...] "some of Sharaku's later triptychs... are occasionally as dull as known Kabukidōs".|$|E
