These cells communicate with endothelial cells via gap junctions and in turn cause endothelial cells to proliferate or be selectively inhibited.

40|$|Cardiac {{hypertrophy}} {{triggered by}} mechanical load possesses features {{in common with}} growth factor signal transduction. A hemodynamic load provokes rapid expression of the growth factor-inducible nuclear oncogene, c-fos, and certain peptide growth factors specifically stimulate the "fetal" cardiac genes associated with hypertrophy, {{even in the absence}} of load. These include the gene encoding vascular smooth muscle <b>alpha-actin,</b> the earliest <b>alpha-actin</b> expressed during cardiac myogenesis; however, it is not known whether reactivation of the smooth muscle <b>alpha-actin</b> gene occurs in ventricular hypertrophy. We therefore investigated myocardial expression of the smooth muscle <b>alpha-actin</b> gene after hemodynamic overload. Smooth muscle <b>alpha-actin</b> mRNA was discernible 24 h after coarctation and was persistently expressed for up to 30 d. In hypertrophied hearts, the prevalence of smooth muscle <b>alpha-actin</b> gene induction was 0. 909, versus 0. 545 for skeletal muscle <b>alpha-actin</b> (P less than 0. 05). Ventricular mass after 2 d or more of aortic constriction was more highly correlated with smooth muscle <b>alpha-actin</b> gene activation (r = 0. 852; P = 0. 0001) than with skeletal muscle <b>alpha-actin</b> (r = 0. 532; P = 0. 009); P less than 0. 0005 for the difference in the correlation coefficients. Thus, smooth muscle <b>alpha-actin</b> is a molecular marker of the presence and extent of pressure-overload hypertrophy, whose correlation with cardiac growth at least equals that of skeletal <b>alpha-actin.</b> Induction of smooth muscle <b>alpha-actin</b> was delayed and sustained after aortic constriction, whereas the nuclear oncogenes c-jun and junB were expressed rapidly and transiently, providing potential dimerization partners for transcriptional control by c-fos...|$|E

In the tissue sections, indirect immunofluorescence revealed intense labeling of vascular smooth muscle cells and precapillary pericytes for SM <b>alpha-actin.</b> Glomerular cells including MC were negative, {{with the exception of}} scattered smooth muscle cells in the wall of the intraglomerular segment of the efferent arteriole. In contrast, in MC cultures 50 to 95 % of the cells displayed bright fluorescence. Immunoreactivity for SM <b>alpha-actin</b> first appeared 3 days after explanation of glomeruli and increased until the primary culture reached subconfluence. In each subculture (1 to 10) expression of SM <b>alpha-actin</b> was weak on day 1 and pronounced at subconfluence. Growth arrest of subconfluent cultures for 1 to 7 days in serum-free medium did not alter the percentage of cells positive for SM <b>alpha-actin.</b> However, exposure of MC to serum-free medium beginning {{on the first day of}} subculture curtailed expression of SM <b>alpha-actin.</b> Double-labeling with antibodies against proliferating cell nuclear antigen and SM <b>alpha-actin</b> revealed SM alpha-actin-positive filaments in both replicating and resting cells.

40|$|The {{expression}} of cytoplasmic beta-actin and cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle alpha-actins during early avian cardiogenesis was analyzed by {{in situ hybridization}} with mRNA-specific single-stranded DNA probes. The cytoplasmic beta-actin gene was ubiquitously expressed in the early chicken embryo. In contrast, the <b>alpha-actin</b> genes were sequentially activated in avian cardiac tissue {{during the early stages}} of heart tube formation. The accumulation of large quantities of smooth muscle <b>alpha-actin</b> transcripts in epimyocardial cells preceded the {{expression of}} the sarcomeric <b>alpha-actin</b> genes. The accumulation of skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> mRNAs in the developing heart lagged behind that of cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> by several embryonic stages. At Hamburger- Hamilton stage 12, the smooth muscle <b>alpha-actin</b> gene was selectively down-regulated in the heart such that only the conus, which subsequently participates {{in the formation of the}} vascular trunks, continued to express this gene. This modulation in smooth muscle alpha- actin gene expression correlated with the beginning of coexpression of sarcomeric <b>alpha-actin</b> transcripts in the epimyocardium and the onset of circulation in the embryo.

40|$|The {{skeletal}} and cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> {{genes are}} coexpressed in muscle development but exhibit distinctive tissue-specific patterns of expression. We used an in vivo competition assay and an in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay {{to demonstrate that}} both genes interact with a common trans-acting factor(s). However, {{there was at least}} one gene-specific cis-acting sequence in the skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> gene that interacted with a trans-acting factor which was not rate limiting in the expression of the cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> gene. The common factor(s) interacted with several cis-acting regions that corresponded to sequences that are required for the transcriptional modulation of these sarcomeric <b>alpha-actin</b> genes in muscle cells. These regulatory regions contained the sequence motif CC(A + T-rich) 6 GG, which is known as a CArG box. Results of in vivo competition assays demonstrated that the factor(s) bound by the skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> gene is also essential for the maximal activity of the cardiac <b>alpha-actin,</b> simian virus 40 (SV 40), alpha 2 (I) -collagen, and the beta-actin promoters in muscle cells. In contrast, fibroblastic cells contained functionally distinct transcription factor(s) that were used by the SV 40 enhancer but that did not interact with the sarcomeric <b>alpha-actin</b> cis-acting sequences. The existence of functionally different factors in these cell types may explain the myogenic specificity of these sarcomeric <b>alpha-actin</b> genes. Results of in vitro studies suggested that both the sarcomeric <b>alpha-actin</b> genes interact with the CArG box-binding factor CBF and that the skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> promoter contains multiple CBF-binding sites. In contrast, CBF did not interact in vitro with a classical CAAT box, the SV 40 enhancer, or a linker scanner mutation of an <b>alpha-actin</b> CArG box.

40|$|In cardiac muscle, acidic {{and basic}} {{fibroblast}} growth factors (aFGF and bFGF) regulate {{at least five}} genes in common (including alpha and beta myosin heavy chains, atrial natriuretic factor, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase), provoking a generalized "fetal" phenotype similar to events in pressure-overload hypertrophy; however, aFGF and bFGF differentially control the striated alpha-actins. bFGF stimulates and aFGF inhibits skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> transcripts associated with the embryonic heart, whereas cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> mRNA is inhibited by aFGF but not bFGF. To elucidate mechanisms for these selective and discordant actions of aFGF and bFGF on cardiac muscle, chicken skeletal and cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> promoter-driven reporter genes were introduced into neonatal rat cardiac myocytes by electroporation. Skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> transcription was selectively stimulated by bFGF, whereas the cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> promoter was unaffected.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the relationship between chromosomal location and regulation of the two human genes encoding the sarcomeric muscle actins. The human genes encoding skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> and cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> are co-expressed in both human skeletal muscle and heart.

We observed the segregation of restriction endonuclease-generated DNA cleavage fragments that hybridize to the two probes. The two striated muscle genes do not co-segregate and are on different autosomes. The human cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> gene (ACTC) is on chromosome 15 in the q 11 [...] qter region whereas the skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> gene (ACTSK) is on chromosome 1 in the p 21 [...] qter region.

40|$|Lymphatics are {{necessary}} for the generation and regulation of lymph flow. Lymphatics use phasic contractions and extrinsic compressions to generate flow; tonic contractions alter resistance. Lymphatic muscle exhibits important differences from typical vascular smooth muscle. In this study, the thoracic duct exhibited significant functional differences from mesenteric lymphatics. To understand the molecular basis for these differences, we examined the profiles of contractile proteins and their messages in mesenteric lymphatics, thoracic duct, and arterioles. Results demonstrated that mesenteric lymphatics express only SMB smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), whereas thoracic duct and arterioles expressed both SMA and SMB isoforms. Both SM 1 and SM 2 isoforms of SM-MHC were detected in arterioles and mesenteric and thoracic lymphatics. In addition, the fetal cardiac/skeletal slow-twitch muscle-specific beta-MHC message was detected only in mesenteric lymphatics. All four actin messages, cardiac <b>alpha-actin,</b> vascular <b>alpha-actin,</b> enteric gamma-actin, and skeletal <b>alpha-actin,</b> were present in both mesenteric lymphatics and arterioles. However, in thoracic duct, predominantly cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> and vascular <b>alpha-actin</b> were found. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses corroborated the mRNA studies. However, in arterioles only vascular <b>alpha-actin</b> protein was detected.

40|$|Skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> gene {{products}} are coexpressed with cardiac alpha-actins in cardiac tissue of adult humans, cows, and pigs; in prenatal rats; and during hypertrophy due either to increased hemodynamic load or {{the administration of}} alpha-adrenergic agonists. Because there is preferential synthesis of the beta-myosin heavy chain in each case, {{it has been suggested}} that the synthesis of skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> in cardiac tissue is linked to that of beta-myosin heavy chain. To test this hypothesis, thyroid hormone, which causes cardiac hypertrophy with preferential synthesis of alpha-myosin heavy chain, was administered to normal and hypophysectomized rats. Animals were sacrificed from 2 to 24 hr after the injection of either 1 or 5 micrograms of hormone per 10 g of body weight. The relative amount of mRNA for skeletal and cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> was measured by using the technique of primer extension. Thyroid hormone caused a rapid increase in the amount of skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> mRNA relative to controls, more than 7 times in hearts from normal animals and 15 times in hearts from hypophysectomized animals. A small increase in cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> mRNA also occurred. The rapid increase in transcripts for skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> under conditions where the isoform of myosin heavy chain that is being synthesized is primarily alpha demonstrates independent patterns of activation of the actin and myosin heavy chain multigene families during cardiac growth in mammals...|$|E
40|$|During pressure-load {{hypertrophy}} of {{the adult}} heart in vivo, there is up-regulation of the mRNA encoding skeletal <b>alpha-actin,</b> the sarcomeric actin iso-mRNA characteristic of mature skeletal muscle and the fetal/neonatal heart. We have shown previously that during alpha 1 -adrenergic receptor-stimulated hypertrophy of cultured rat heart myocytes, the induction of skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> mRNA is {{greater than that of}} the mRNA encoding cardiac <b>alpha-actin,</b> the sarcomeric actin iso-mRNA characteristic {{of the adult}} heart. To determine if this actin iso-mRNA switch during cardiac hypertrophy reflects changes in the transcriptional status of the myocyte nucleus, we quantified the rate of transcription of actin mRNAs and total RNA, using an in vitro run-on transcription assay with nuclei isolated from the cultured myocytes after stimulation with norepinephrine (NE). Transcription of skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> was increased at 3 h after NE, reached a maximum 6. 1 -fold increase at 12 h, and returned to the control level at 24 h. The EC 50 for NE was 200 nM, and pharmacologic studies indicated alpha 1 -receptor specificity. Transcription of cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> was also increased rapidly by NE (maximum 4. 6 -fold vs. control at 3 h). However, cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> transcription had returned to the control level at 6 h, when NE-stimulated skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> transcription was still increasing. Transcription of the cytoskeletal (beta) actin gene was not changed significantly by NE treatment. Total RNA transcription was not increased until 6 h after NE (1. 5 -fold vs. control) and remained elevated through 24 h. Inhibition of protein synthesis did not attenuate NE-stimulated actin gene transcription. Thus the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor mediates a rapid, transient, and selective increase in transcription of the sarcomeric actin isogenes during cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. Skeletal <b>alpha-actin,</b> the fetal/neonatal isogene, is induced preferentially to cardiac <b>alpha-actin,</b> the adult isogene. The different kinetics of actin isogene and total RNA transcription and the independence of transcription from protein synthesis suggest that transcriptional induction via the alpha 1 receptor is complex and may involve preexisting regulatory factors. These results are the first to demonstrate that the alpha 1 -adrenergic receptor is a molecular mediator of transcriptional changes underlying an isogene switch that is known to be associated with cardiac myocyte hypertrophy...|$|E

40|$|In {{cultures}} of differentiated, fusion-blocked muscle cells obtained from embryonic Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica), mitogen stimulation {{leads to an}} immediate reduction in the rates of synthesis of skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) and <b>alpha-actin.</b> The molecular mechanisms responsible for this downregulation were examined. The cellular abundances of the <b>alpha-actin</b> and MHC mRNAs were affected differently by mitogen stimulation; <b>alpha-actin</b> mRNA abundance declined by an amount which quantitatively accounted for the observed decrease in <b>alpha-actin</b> synthesis, whereas MHC mRNA abundance remained virtually unchanged during the first 6 h following mitogen stimulation, a period during which MHC synthesis declined by more than 70 %. MHC mRNA abundance did decline between 6 and 12 h after mitogen stimulation. Downregulation of MHC synthesis therefore involves an initial block in mRNA translation combined with a later loss of MHC mRNA from the cytoplasma, while <b>alpha-actin</b> synthesis is regulated {{at the level of}} mRNA abundance. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that, in addition to transcriptional activation of muscle-specific genes, skeletal muscle differentiation normally involves cell cycle-dependent modulations in cellular factors which control message stability and message translation...|$|E
40|$|The {{complete}} {{nucleotide sequence}} of a genomic clone encoding the mouse skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> gene has been determined. This single-copy gene codes for a protein identical in primary sequence to the rabbit skeletal <b>alpha-actin.</b> It {{has a large}} intron in the 5 '-untranslated region 12 nucleotides upstream from the initiator ATG and five small introns in the coding region at codons specifying amino acids 41 / 42, 150, 204, 267, and 327 / 328. These intron positions are identical to those for the corresponding genes of chickens and rats. Similar to other skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> genes, the nucleotide sequence codes for two amino acids, Met-Cys, preceding the known N-terminal Asp of the mature protein. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of rat, mouse, chicken, and human skeletal muscle <b>alpha-actin</b> genes reveals conserved sequences (some not previously noted) outside of the protein-coding region. Furthermore, several inverted repeat sequences, partially within these conserved regions, have been identified. These sequences are not present in the vertebrate cytoskeletal beta-actin genes.

40|$|Myocardial {{hypertrophy}} in vivo {{is associated}} with reexpression of contractile protein isogenes characteristic of fetal and neonatal development. The molecular signals for hypertrophy and isogene switching are unknown. We studied alpha (sarcomeric) -actin messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in cultured cardiac myocytes from the neonatal rat. In the cultured cells, as in the adult heart in vivo, expression of cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> (cACT) predominated over that of skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> (sACT) mRNA, the fetal/neonatal isoform. alpha 1 -Adrenergic receptor stimulation induced hypertrophy of these cells, increasing total RNA and cytoskeletal actin mRNA by 1. 8 -fold over control, and total <b>alpha-actin</b> mRNA by 4. 3 fold. This disproportionate increase in total <b>alpha-actin</b> mRNA was produced by a preferential induction of sACT mRNA, which increased by 10. 6 -fold over control versus only 2. 6 -fold for cACT mRNA.

40|$|Skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> mRNA {{increases}} in the adult heart during cardiac hypertrophy after the imposition of hemodynamic overload/aortic restriction. 3, 32 Ì† 7, 5 -Triiodo-L-thyronine (T 3) elicits a cardiac response similar {{to the effect of}} prolonged exercise and was recently shown to cause a rapid increase in the amount of skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> mRNA in hearts from normal and hypophysectomized animals. We used transient transfection analysis to show that T 3 induces the expression of the native skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> promoter between nucleotide positions - 2000 and + 239 linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in COS- 1 fibroblasts and myogenic C 2 C 12 cells. This T 3 (10 - 100 nm) -induced transcriptional activation is dependent on the expression of the thyroid hormone receptors from transfected alpha- 1 and beta- 1 c-erbA complementary DNA expression vectors. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to identify a thyroid hormone response element (TRE) in the human skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> gene. This TRE is located between nucleotide positions - 173 and - 149 with respect to the start of transcription at + 1 (52 Ì† 7 TGGTCAACGCAGGGGACCCGGGCGG 32 Ì† 7). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments showed that the putative skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> TRE and defined rodent growth hormone TREs (that bind thyroid hormone receptors in vitro and in vivo) interacted with an identical nuclear factor in vitro in muscle cells that was developmentally regulated during myogenesis. Transient transfection analysis utilizing 52 Ì† 7 unidirectional deletions of the skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> promoter indicated that cis-acting sequences between, nucleotide positions - 432 and - 153, which encompassed the TRE, were required for T 3 /thyroid hormone receptor-dependent trans-activation in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> TRE is juxtaposed next to SRF and SpI binding sites, at its 52 Ì† 7 and 32 Ì† 7 flanks, respectively. It is also surrounded by sequences densely populated by other SpI, SRF, and CTF binding sites. In conclusion, these results indicate that T 3 -induced {{increases in}} <b>alpha-actin</b> mRNA in animals are mediated by a direct transcriptional mechanism that may involve interactions with ubiquitous proteins...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether atrial natriuretic peptide and skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are co-localized in ventricular myocytes of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Background. Atrial natriuretic peptide and skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> are known as augmented genes with cardiac hypertrophy. However, the expression and localization of both genes in chronic failing heart remain unclear. Methods. Left ventricular biopsy specimens were obtained from 14 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Atrial natriuretic peptide and skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> mRNAs were detected by in situ hybridization with specific sulfur- 35 uridine triphosphate-labeled RNA probes in the serial sections. Results. Atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA was detected in 10 patients, and intense signals were localized in the myocytes located in the subendocardium and around the interstitial fibrous area. By contrast, skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> mRNA was homogeneously detected in all myocytes in seven patients. By left ventriculography, patients with skeletal alpha-actin-positive findings had a lower ejection fraction (37. 1 Â± 6. 0 %) than those with negative findings (46. 3 Â± 5. 8 %, p < 0. 05), but atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA expression was not related to left ventricular function. Conclusions. These results indicate that the expression of atrial natriuretic peptide and skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> mRNAs are not always co-localized in the left ventricle of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and suggest that the mechanisms of the regulation of these two genes in the chronic failing heart are different...|$|E
40|$|We have {{introduced}} the chicken genes for cytoplasmic beta-actin, cardiac <b>alpha-actin,</b> and skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> into C 2 cells, a murine myogenic cell line, and into L cells {{by using the}} simian virus 40 -derived vector PSV 2 -gpt. In each selection, {{the entire population of}} transformed cells was analyzed for the expression and regulation of the actin genes by nuclease S 1 assay and primer extension. This was compared to the expression of the vector marker Eco-gpt. The beta-actin gene is transcribed accurately and efficiently both in L-cells and in undifferentiated C 2 cells. In fused C 2 cells, beta-actin transcripts decrease significantly in parallel with the endogenous level of mouse beta-actin mRNA. Eco-gpt RNA levels remain essentially constant during myogenesis. The <b>alpha-actin</b> genes are correctly expressed at low levels in L cells but at significantly higher levels in the C 2 cell background. Unlike the endogenous mouse <b>alpha-actin</b> gene, this level of expression does not change measurably with myogenesis. The skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> gene is expressed poorly in pre- and post-fusion C 2 cells, displaying no induction with differentiation. These results suggest that the tissue specificity of expression is maintained but the pattern of gene regulation for the sarcomeric actins is not. Factors in addition to the sequences flanking these genes are important for modulating gene expression during development. The decrease in the levels of beta-actin RNA during C 2 cell differentiation provides a model system in which to study gene repression during development...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that two genes {{regulating}} myogenesis (MyoD and myogenin) are coexpressed with cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> during early stages of skeletal muscle development. Myogenin and MyoD are members of a family of regulatory proteins which share a helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif required for dimerization and DNA binding. Myogenin and MyoD form heterodimers with the ubiquitous HLH protein E 12 which bind cis-acting DNA elements that have an E box (CANNTG) at their core. E boxes are present in the control regions of numerous muscle-specific genes, although their functional importance in regulating many of these genes has not yet been evaluated. In this report we examine the possibility that myogenin (or MyoD) directly transactivates the cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> promoter. Heterodimers of myogenin and E 12 (or MyoD and E 12) specifically bound a restriction fragment extending from - 200 to - 103 relative to the start of cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> transcription. Methylation interference footprints pinpointed the site of interaction to an E box immediately adjacent to a previously identified CArG box (CArG 3). Site-directed mutations to the DNA-binding site revealed that either an intact E box or an intact CArG 3 is required for induction of the cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> promoter in myoblasts and for transactivation by myogenin in cotransfected fibroblasts. However, deletion and substitution experiments indicate that the complex E box/CArG 3 element alone does not confer muscle-specific expression to a minimal promoter. These results suggest that direct and indirect pathways involving multiple cis-acting elements mediate the induction of the cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> promoter by myogenin and MyoD...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac-specific gene {{expression}} is intricately regulated {{in response to}} developmental, hormonal, and hemodynamic stimuli. To test whether cardiac muscle might be a target for regulation by peptide growth factors, the effect of three growth factors on the actin and myosin gene families was investigated by Northern blot analysis in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF beta 1, 1 ng/ml) and {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (FGF, 25 ng/ml) elicited changes corresponding to those induced by hemodynamic load. The "fetal" beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC) was up-regulated about four-fold, whereas the "adult" alpha MHC was inhibited greater than 50 - 60 %; expression of alpha-skeletal actin increased approximately two-fold, with little or no change in alpha-cardiac actin. Thus, peptide growth factors alter the program of differentiated {{gene expression}} in cardiac myocytes, and are sufficient to provoke fetal contractile protein gene expression, characteristic of pressure-overload hypertrophy. Acidic FGF (25 ng/ml) produced seven- to eightfold reciprocal changes in MHC expression but, unlike either TGF-beta 1 or basic FGF, inhibited both striated <b>alpha-actin</b> genes by 70 - 90 %. Expression of vascular smooth muscle <b>alpha-actin,</b> the earliest <b>alpha-actin</b> induced during cardiac myogenesis, was increased by all three growth factors. Thus, three <b>alpha-actin</b> genes demonstrate distinct responses to acidic vs. basic FGF...|$|E
40|$|Serum {{response}} factor (SRF) is a phosphoprotein that regulates skeletal and cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> gene transcription. Myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK), a muscle- and neuron-restricted kinase, enhanced SRF-mediated promoter {{activity of the}} skeletal and cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> genes in C 2 C 12 myoblasts {{as well as in}} nonmyogenic cells. DMPK phosphorylated SRF in vitro in the alphaI coil of the DNA-binding domain in the MADS box, a highly conserved region required for DNA binding, dimerization, and co-activator interaction in COS and CV 1 cells. Threonine 159 in the MADS box alphaI coil was a specific phosphorylation target in vitro as well as in vivo of both DMPK and protein kinase C-alpha. Substitution of threonine 159 with the nonphosphorylatable residue alanine markedly diminished activation of the cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> promoter in the presence of kinase, while its substitution with aspartic acid, to introduce a negative charge and mimic phosphorylation, restored activation completely. Phosphorylation of the MADS box may constitute a novel mechanism for regulation of SRF-dependent actin gene transcription...|$|E
40|$|Rescue of {{skeletal}} muscle alpha-actin-null mice by cardiac (fetal) <b>alpha-actin</b> NOWAK, Kristen J., et al. Skeletal muscle <b>alpha-actin</b> (ACTA 1) {{is the major}} actin in postnatal {{skeletal muscle}}. Mutations of ACTA 1 cause mostly fatal congenital myopathies. Cardiac <b>alpha-actin</b> (ACTC) is the major striated actin in adult heart and fetal skeletal muscle. It is unknown why ACTC and ACTA 1 expression switch during development. We investigated whether ACTC can replace ACTA 1 in postnatal skeletal muscle. Two ACTC transgenic mouse lines were crossed with Acta 1 knockout mice (which all die by 9 d after birth). Offspring resulting from the cross with the high expressing line survive to old age, and their skeletal muscles show no gross pathological features. The mice are not impaired on grip strength, rotarod, or locomotor activity. These findings indicate that ACTC is sufficiently similar to ACTA 1 to produce adequate function in postnatal skeletal muscle. This raises the prospect that ACTC reactivation might provide a therapy for ACTA 1 diseases. In addition, the mouse model will allow analysis of the precise functional differences between ACTA 1 and ACTC. NOWAK, Kristen J., et al.

40|$|We have {{previously}} observed that DNA sequences within the 5 '-flanking {{region of the}} chicken skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> gene harbor a cis-acting regulatory element that influences cell type and developmental stage-specific expression (J. M. Grichnik, D. J. Bergsma, and R. J. Schwartz, Nucleic Acids Res 14 : 1683 - 1701, 1986). In this report we have constructed unidirectional 5 '-deletion and region-specific deletion-insertion mutations of the chicken skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> upstream region and inserted these into the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression vector pSV 0 CAT. These constructions were used to locate DNA sequences that are required for developmental modulation of expression when transfected into differentiating myoblasts. With this assay we have delimited the 5 ' boundary of a cis-acting regulatory element to ca. 200 base pairs upstream of the mRNA cap site. In addition, we have preliminarily identified DNA sequences that may be important subcomponents within this element. A second major focus {{of this study was}} to identify those DNA signals within the regulatory element that control transcription. Toward this end, the expression phenotypes of progressive 5 '-deletion and deletion-insertion mutants of the 5 '-flanking region of the chicken skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> gene were assayed in microinjected Xenopus laevis oocytes. These experiments defined a cis-acting transcriptional control region having a 5 ' border 107 base pairs preceding the <b>alpha-actin</b> RNA cap site. Proximal and distal functionally important regions of DNA were identified within this element. These DNA signals included within their DNA sequences the "CCAAT" and "TATA" box homologies...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate whether endogenous sulfur dioxide (SO 2) plays a role in vascular calcification (VC) in rats and its possible mechanisms. In vivo medial vascular calcification was induced in rats by vitamin D 3 and nicotine for four weeks. In vitro calcification of cultured A 7 r 5 vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) was induced by calcifying media containing 5 mmol/L CaCl 2. Aortic smooth muscle (SM) <b>alpha-actin,</b> runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx 2), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and Smad expression was measured. VC rats showed dispersed calcified nodules among the elastic fibers in calcified aorta with increased aortic calcium content and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. SM <b>alpha-actin</b> was markedly decreased, but the osteochondrogenic marker Runx 2 concomitantly increased and TGF-beta/Smad signaling was activated, in association with the downregulated SO 2 /aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) pathway. However, SO 2 supplementation successfully ameliorated vascular calcification, and increased SM <b>alpha-actin</b> expression, but inhibited Runx 2 and TGF-beta/Smad expression. In calcified A 7 r 5 VSMCs, the endogenous SO 2 /AAT pathway was significantly downregulated. SO 2 treatment reduced the calcium deposits, calcium content, ALP activity and Runx 2 expression and downregulated the TGF-beta/Smad pathway in A 7 r 5 cells but increased SM <b>alpha-actin</b> expression. In brief, SO 2 significantly ameliorated vascular calcification in association with downregulation of the TGF-beta/Smad pathway.

40|$|The chicken {{skeletal}} <b>alpha-actin</b> {{gene promoter}} region (- 202 to - 12) provides myogenic transcriptional specificity. This promoter contains partial dyad symmetry about an axis at nucleotide - 108 and in transfection experiments {{is capable of}} directing transcription in a bidirectional manner. At least three different transcription initiation start sites, oriented toward upstream sequences, were mapped 25 to 30 base pairs from TATA-like regions. The opposing transcriptional activity was potentiated upon the deletion of sequences proximal to the <b>alpha-actin</b> transcription start site. Thus, sequences which serve to position RNA polymerase for <b>alpha-actin</b> transcription may allow, in their absence, the selection of alternative and reverse-oriented start sites. Nuclear runoff transcription assays of embryonic muscle indicated that divergent transcription may occur in vivo but with rapid turnover of nuclear transcripts. Divergent transcriptional activity enabled us to define the 3 ' regulatory boundary of the skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> promoter which retains {{a high level of}} myogenic transcriptional activity. The 3 ' regulatory border was detected when serial 3 ' deletions bisected the element (- 91 CCAAA TATGG - 82) which reduced transcriptional activity by 80 %. Previously we showed that disruption of its upstream counterpart (- 127 CCAAAGAAGG - 136) resulted in about a 90 % decrease in activity. These element pairs, which we describe as CCAAT box-associated repeats, are conserved in all sequenced vertebrate sarcomeric actin genes and may act in a cooperative manner to facilitate transcription in myogenic cells...|$|E
40|$|Serum {{response}} factor (SRF) gene expression in avian embryonic muscle lineages plays {{a central role}} in activating <b>alpha-actin</b> gene activity. In early stage HH 6 avian embryos, SRF mRNA expression showed strong localization to the neural groove, primitive streak, lateral plate mesoderm, and Hensen's node, while distinct SRF expression was seen later in the neural folds and the somites by HH stage 8. SRF transcripts appeared in the precardiac splanchnic mesoderm in stage HH 9 embryos and was detected at higher levels in the myocardium, somites, and lateral mesoderm of HH 11 embryos. SRF antibody staining demonstrated significant SRF protein accumulation in the myocardium of the developing heart and the myotomal portion of somites. During primary myogenesis in culture, SRF transcripts and nuclear SRF protein content increased about 40 -fold, as primary myoblasts withdrew from the cell cycle, reaching their highest levels prior to the upregulation of the skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> gene. A dominant-negative SRF mutant, SRFpm 1, which inhibited DNA binding, but not dimerization of monomeric SRF subunits, blocked transcriptional activation of a skeletal <b>alpha-actin</b> promoter-luciferase reporter gene during myogenesis. Transcriptional blockade was reversed by co-transfections of a wild-type SRF expression vector, but was not rescued by the expression of other myogenic factors, such as MyoD and Mef- 2 C. Thus, SRF displayed an embryonic expression pattern restricted primarily to striated muscle cell lineages, in which increased mass of nuclear SRF was obligatory for <b>alpha-actin</b> gene transcription...|$|E
40|$|An {{angiogenin}} binding protein isolated previously from endothelial cells {{has been}} shown to be a member of the actin family. Calf pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE) cells were investigated for the presence of surface actin by immunoblotting of isolated surface proteins and by immunofluorescence. CPAE cell surface proteins were isolated by selective apical biotinylation and recovery of biotinylated proteins by avidin affinity chromatography. Immunoblotting with a specific smooth muscle <b>alpha-actin</b> antibody detected the presence of this type of actin among the isolated cell surface proteins. Immunofluorescence confirmed that smooth muscle <b>alpha-actin</b> is localized at the surface of nonpermeabilized CPAE cells. Exposure of CPAE cells to angiogenin prior to cell surface immunostaining diminished the signal. When CPAE and rat aortic smooth muscle cells were made permeable before staining, stress fibers could be recognized by the antibody in smooth muscle cells but not CPAE cells. The results indicate that a smooth muscle type of <b>alpha-actin</b> is localized specifically on the surface of cultured CPAE cells where it might interact with angiogenin and other actin binding proteins present in the extracellular environment...|$|E
