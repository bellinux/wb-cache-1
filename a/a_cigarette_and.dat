5|$|During a hailstorm in Washington state, {{university}} students run to find shelter. One girl, Lauren (Kristi Angus), {{stands in the}} rain, lights <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> goes up in flames. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels to the university to interview witnesses to the death. A teaching assistant tells Black that the dead girl was highly intelligent, pointing out an armillary sphere Lauren had constructed. She also tells Black that the previous Millennium Group contact had taken great interest in this sphere. Black did not realize the Group had sent another member, but on leaving, he meets the man in questionâ€”Dennis Hoffman (Brad Dourif). Hoffman describes his theories to Black, detailing how when several planets achieve syzygy on May 5, 2000, a series of natural disasters will bring {{about the end of}} the world. Hoffman believes that this cataclysm will be preceded by strange events and weather patterns.|$|E

25|$|Bankhead {{received}} a Tony Award nomination for her {{performance of a}} bizarre 50-year-old mother in the short-lived Mary Coyle Chase play, Midgie Purvis (1961). It was a physically demanding role and Bankhead insisted on doing the stunts herself, including sliding down a staircase bannister. She received glowing reviews, but the play itself suffered from numerous rewrites and failed to last beyond a month. Her last theatrical appearance was in a revival of another Williams play, The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore (1963), directed by Tony Richardson. She had suffered a severe burn on her right hand from a match exploding while she lit <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> it was aggravated by the importance of jewelery props in the play. She took heavy painkillers, but these dried her mouth, and most critics thought that Tallulah's line readings were unintelligible. Like Antony and Cleopatra, the nadir of her career, she only made five performances, {{and in the same}} unhappy theater.|$|E
25|$|The first {{automatic}} electric fire alarm was patented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton, {{an associate of}} Thomas Edison. George Andrew Darby patented the first European electrical heat detector in 1902 in Birmingham, England. In the late 1930s Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger tried to invent a sensor for poison gas. He expected that gas entering the sensor would bind to ionized air molecules and thereby alter an electric current in a circuit in the instrument. His device did not meet its purpose: small concentrations of gas {{had no effect on}} the sensor's conductivity. Frustrated, Jaeger lit <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> was soon surprised to notice that a meter on the instrument had registered a drop in current. Smoke particles from his cigarette had apparently done what poison gas could not. Jaeger's experiment was one of the advances that {{paved the way for the}} modern smoke detector. In 1939 Swiss physicist Ernst Meili devised an ionization chamber device capable of detecting combustible gases in mines. He also invented a cold cathode tube that could amplify the small signal generated by the detection mechanism to a strength sufficient to activate an alarm.|$|E

500|$|Gaga {{announced}} [...] "You and I" [...] as {{the fourth}} single from Born This Way on July 22, 2011.

[...] It features two black-and-white images of Gaga's male alter ego Jo Calderone smoking <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> sporting sideburns. The Calderone character made a previous appearance in June 2011, when Gaga posed as him in London for a series of photos by photographer Nick Knight, arranged by stylist Nicola Formichetti. One shot features him wearing a blazer and white T-shirt with his head down smoking a cigarette. The other image is of Jo Calderone in silhouette exhaling a cloud of smoke.|$|E
500|$|McCay first {{proposed}} a strip {{in which a}} tobacco fiend finds himself at the North Pole, unable to secure <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> a light.

[...] The strip appeared in a Herald subsidiary, the Evening Telegram, and the Heralds editor required McCay to use a pseudonym for the strip work to keep it separate from his other work. [...] McCay signed Rarebit Fiend strips as [...] "Silas", a name he borrowing from a neighborhood garbage cart driver. [...] After switching to William Randolph Hearst's New York American newspaper in 1911, McCay dropped the [...] "Silas" [...] pseudonym and signed his work with his own name.|$|E

500|$|Nick is {{incapable}} of self-reflection and unable to cope with pain. Hemingway conveys this through symbolism {{and a series of}} objective correlatives (tangible objects), which allow the reader insight to the character's motivations. For example, on his arrival in Seney he literally falls off the train, shocked {{at the sight of the}} burned town, but on a deeper level in shock from his war experience. Leaving behind the burnt landscape, Nick climbs a hill in the heat, and surveys the town's damage. The burning and heat symbolize his memory of war-torn Italy, but he hopes for regrowth: [...] "It could not all be burned. He knew that". At the top of the hill, he takes a break, smokes <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> speaks for the first time. Flora suggests that speaking symbolizes his humanity, lost in the war, which he is beginning to regain.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Madonna's {{look and}} attire she wore to the Sex pre-release party was ranked by People {{magazine}} {{as one of}} her [...] "50 Looks We Can't Forget".

The picture was bought by an unnamed collector for almost US$24,000 ($ in [...] dollars). In 2011, according to the BookFinder.com, Sex was the most requested out-of-circulation publication and still remains the best-selling coffee table book.

500|$|He {{heads to}} her house, which is eerily quiet. Going in, he discovers {{a bottle of}} whiskey, several {{cigarette}} butts, and a telegram from the government. Dorothy's husband is dead, his plane shot down over France. Dorothy comes out of her bedroom, crying, and Hermie tells her [...] "I'm sorry." [...] The sense of empathy triggers her to channel to Hermie some of her loneliness. She turns on the record player and invites Hermie to dance with her. They kiss and embrace, tears on both their faces. Without speaking, and to the sound only of the waves, they move to the bedroom, where she draws him into bed and gently makes love with him. Afterward, withdrawing again into her world of hurt, Dorothy retires to the porch, leaving Hermie alone in her bedroom. He approaches her on the porch, where she can only quietly say [...] "Good night, Hermie." [...] He leaves, his last image of Dorothy being of her leaning against the railing, as she smokes <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> stares into the night sky.|$|E

500|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Nick fills a jar with 50 dew-heavy {{grasshoppers}} found under a log he names a [...] "grasshopper lodging-house", eats breakfast, drinks sweetened coffee {{and makes a}} sliced onion sandwich. After checking and assembling his fly fishing rod and tying on damp leader line, {{he walks to the}} river with a net hanging from his belt, a sack over his shoulder and the jar of grasshoppers dangling around his neck. Wading in the water, he fishes the shallows; he lands a trout that [...] "was mottled with clear, water-over-gravel color" [...] that he releases. Moving into a pool of deeper water, he hooks a large trout, [...] "as broad as a salmon", which he loses. After a rest, he moves away from the pool to the more shallow center of the river and catches two trout that he stows in his sack. Sitting on a log, smoking <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> eating his onion sandwich, he thinks about fishing the deep water of the swamp, but decides to wait for another day. At the log in the river, he kills, guts and cleans the two trout before returning to camp.|$|E
500|$|On {{leaving the}} Ã‰cole Niedermeyer, FaurÃ© was {{appointed}} organist at the Church of Saint-Sauveur, at Rennes in Brittany. He {{took up the}} post in January 1866. During his four years at Rennes he supplemented his income by taking private pupils, giving [...] "countless piano lessons". At Saint-SaÃ«ns's regular prompting he continued to compose, but none of his works from this period survive. He was bored at Rennes and had an uneasy relationship with the parish priest, who correctly doubted FaurÃ©'s religious conviction. FaurÃ© was regularly seen stealing out during the sermon for <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> in early 1870, when he turned up to play at Mass one Sunday still in his evening clothes, having been out all night at a ball, {{he was asked to}} resign. Almost immediately, with the discreet aid of Saint-SaÃ«ns, he secured the post of assistant organist at the church of Notre-Dame de Clignancourt, in the north of Paris. He remained there for only a few months. On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 he volunteered for military service. He took part in the action to raise the Siege of Paris, and saw action at Le Bourget, Champigny and CrÃ©teil. He was awarded a Croix de Guerre.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Nowitzki can put {{the ball}} down and drive with it from the perimeter, like few {{have been able to}} do with his size. NBA.com lauds his {{versatility}} by stating: [...] "The 7â€“0 forward who at times mans the pivot can strike fear in an opponent when he corrals a rebound and leads the break or prepares to launch a three-point bomb." [...] Charles Barkley says the best way to guard Nowitzki is to [...] "get <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> a blindfold". Later on in his career, Nowitzki also developed an unorthodox post up game, often backing down his opponents from the free throw line or near the middle of the key, opening up the floor for multiple passing angles should a double team come his way. [...] When defenses guard Nowitzki with one of their biggest men, who is then pulled out to the perimeter, the net effect is that while Nowitzki's own statistics are actually compromised by being out of position to offensively rebound or make an easy close-range basket, the rest of the team becomes more offensively potent with the defense having to be spread across the floor. Often, this creates mismatches that his teammates can exploit. The Mavericks system and international play exposed him to an open passing game, making him dangerous as a point forward and post playmaker as well.|$|E
