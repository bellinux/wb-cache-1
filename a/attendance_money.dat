40|$|The most {{valuable}} lesson I {{learned as a}} student of Hy Minsky's at Berkeley I learned after the seminars. Hy always had a good <b>attendance</b> at his <b>Money</b> and Banking seminars from the Bank of California and the San Francisco Fed, and we would all go to a local bierstube, where the beer came in vast pitchers and seemed in infinite supply. There I would watch fascinated as Hy, who always dominated and steered the conversation, would turn first to a student, then to a banker, asking questions geared quite precisely to what each could reasonably be expected to know: theoretical questions to unworldly students and matters of practice and policy to the bankers. There seemed to be two entirely separate worlds of discourse-only Hy seemed able to live in both at once. It was all grist to his mill: in the next seminar, the answers to practical questions {{became part of the}} theoretical discourse, and the-ory would be turned to the analysis of some aspect of bank behavior we had heard about over beer. Despite all the pressures of the mainstream search for "pure " the-ory, Hy never departed from this method: the historical and institutional contin-gency of economic theory is a hallmark of Hy's work. Like so much that I should have learned at the time, this lesson took time to come to some sort of fruition: I am by temperament a theorist, much less engaged with the world than Hy, who was always deeply engaged. Eventually, the historical and institutional foundations of Keynes's General Theory began to intrigue me-and then a breakthrough came, when two big issues in economic theory came together: I realized that the reversal of causality between saving and investment was dependent on the banking system's having reached the stage at which it could create loans "by the stroke of the pen, " independently of saving, because the resulting deposits had become means of payment and would be willingly held [Chick 1983].
