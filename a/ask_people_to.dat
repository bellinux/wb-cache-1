25|$|The use of guns in Noten's work {{came about}} by chance. In the past Noten had felt {{uneasy about the}} large number of people in his {{neighbourhood}} that carried guns. Whenever he could he would <b>ask</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> give him their gun or he would buy it from them. He would then throw it away or keep it in store without any particular purpose for it. After a while he had quite a collection and he thought he might just as well use these guns in his works of art. It also gave him the idea of a project he called Design Against Crime in which he collaborated with the authorities to persuade people to give up their guns in return for a work of art.|$|E

Wallace and Al Lingo decide to use force at an {{upcoming}} night march in Marion, Alabama, using state troopers to assault the marchers. A group of protesters runs into a restaurant to hide, but troopers rush in, beat and shoot Jimmie Lee Jackson. King and Bevel meet with Cager Lee, Jackson's grandfather, at the morgue. King speaks to <b>ask</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> continue {{to fight for their}} rights. King receives harassing phone calls with a recording of sexual activity implied to be him and another woman leading to an argument with Coretta. King is criticized by members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).|$|E

[...] French Ambassador Alain Remy {{said that this was}} a central requirement for the European Union to begin disbursing financial aid.

Dmitri Yarosh, the Right Sector leader said that “It’s not normal to <b>ask</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> hand in their weapons in the situation we have now.” [...] Canadians have had their own debate over the federal gun registry, which had been cancelled by the Harper government a few years earlier.|$|E

2500|$|Because some {{governments have}} {{strongly}} promoted atheism {{and others have}} strongly condemned it, atheism may be either over-reported or under-reported for different countries. There {{is a great deal}} of room for debate as to the accuracy of any method of estimation, as the opportunity for misreporting (intentionally or not) a category of people without an organizational structure is high. [...] Also, many surveys on religious identification <b>ask</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> identify themselves as [...] "agnostics" [...] or [...] "atheists", which is potentially confusing, since these terms are interpreted differently, with some identifying themselves as being agnostic atheists. Additionally, many of these surveys only gauge the number of irreligious people, not the number of actual atheists, or group the two together. For example, research indicates that the fastest growing religious status may be [...] "no religion" [...] in the United States, but this includes all kinds of atheists, agnostics, and theists. Non-religious people make up 9.66%, while one fifth of them are atheists.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, Kaine {{argued that}} the U.S. {{military}} intervention against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), undertaken by President Obama, was unconstitutional without a new congressional authorization {{for the use of}} military force against ISIL. In November 2014, at the Halifax International Security Forum, Kaine, together with Senator John McCain, emphasized the necessity of such a congressional authorization, saying: [...] "You just can't have a war without Congress. You can't <b>ask</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> risk their lives, risk getting killed, seeing other folks getting killed or injured if Congress isn't willing to do the job to put their thumbprint on this and say, this is a national mission and worth it." [...] After the April 2017 Shayrat missile strike in Syria, ordered by President Donald Trump, Kaine said: [...] "There is no legal justification for this. He should not have done this without coming to Congress." [...] On Meet the Press, Kaine stated: [...] "I'm a strong supporter that the U.S. should take action to protect humanitarian causes, like the ban on chemical weapons. Where I differ from this administration, and I took the same position with respect to President Obama, we are a nation that's not supposed to take military action, start war, without a plan that's presented to and approved by Congress." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Cake and Sodomy" [...] is {{the second}} track on the album. In 1990, Manson met a woman at a McDonald's {{restaurant}} in Fort Lauderdale who invited him to spend a weekend with her in New York City. Upon discovering that the girl was using her sister's ID because she {{was too young to}} work, Manson abandoned her, shortly after which he ran into two clubbers from South Florida. Manson spent the remainder of his stay in New York at the clubbers' hotel room, where he stumbled on public-access television cable television channels, which were [...] "a completely new phenomenon" [...] to him. Manson [...] "spent hours flipping through the station, watching Pat Robertson preach about society's evils and then <b>ask</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> call him with their credit card number," [...] while [...] "on the other channel, a guy was greasing up his cock with Vaseline and asking people to call and give him their credit card number." [...] This inspired Manson to grab the hotel notepad and begin penning the song's lyrics. Manson explains in his autobiography The Long Hard Road Out of Hell that [...] "I had written other songs I thought were good, but [...] "Cake and Sodomy" [...] {{was more than just a}} good song. As an anthem for the hypocritical America slobbering on the tit of Christianity, it was a blueprint for our future message." ...|$|E

2500|$|That February 4, President Lyndon Johnson {{made his}} first public {{statement}} {{in support of the}} Selma campaign. At midday, Judge Thomas, at the Justice Department's urging, issued an injunction that suspended Alabama’s current literacy test, ordered Selma to take at least 100 applications per registration day, and guaranteed that all applications received by June 1 would be processed before July. In response to Thomas' favorable ruling, and in alarm at Malcolm X's visit, Andrew Young, who was not in charge of the Selma movement, said he would suspend demonstrations. James Bevel, however, continued to <b>ask</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> line up at the voter's registration office as they had been doing, and Dr. King called Young from jail, telling him the demonstrations would continue. They did so the next day, and more than 500 protesters were arrested. On February 5, King bailed himself and Abernathy out of jail. On February 6, the White House announced that it would urge Congress to enact a voting rights bill during the current session, and that the Vice-President and Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach would meet with King in the following week. [...] On February 9, King met with Attorney General Katzenbach, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, and White House aides before having a brief, seven-minute session with President Johnson. [...] Following the Oval Office visit, King reported that Johnson planned to deliver his message “very soon.” ...|$|E
