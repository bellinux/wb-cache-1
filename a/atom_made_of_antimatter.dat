40|$|An {{observation}} of relativistic antihydrogen atoms is {{reported in this}} dissertation. Experiment 862 at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory observed antihydrogen atoms produced by the interaction of a circulating beam of high momentum (3 < p < 9 GeV/c) antiprotons and a jet of molecular hydrogen gas. Since the neutral antihydrogen does not bend in the antiproton source magnets, the detectors could be located far from the interaction point on a beamline tangent to the storage ring. The detection of the antihydrogen is accomplished by ionizing the atoms far from the interaction point. The positron is deflected by a magnetic spectrometer and detected, as are the back to back photons resulting from its annihilation. The antiproton travels a distance long enough for its momentum and time of flight to be measured accurately. A statistically significant sample of 101 antihydrogen atoms has been observed. A measurement of the cross section for {bar H}{sup 0 } production is outlined within. The cross section corresponds to the process where a high momentum antiproton causes e{sup +} e{sup -} pair creation near a nucleus with the e{sup +} being captured by the antiproton. Antihydrogen is the first <b>atom</b> <b>made</b> exclusively <b>of</b> <b>antimatter</b> to be detected. The observation experiment's results are the first step towards an antihydrogen spectroscopy experiment which would measure the n = 2 Lamb shift and fine structure...|$|R

40|$|When {{applied to}} matter and {{antimatter}} states, the Pauli master equation (PME) may have two forms: time-symmetric, which is conventional, and time-antisymmetric, which is {{suggested in the}} present work. The symmetric and antisymmetric forms correspond to symmetric and antisymmetric extensions of thermodynamics from matter to antimatter [...] - this is demonstrated by proving the corresponding H-theorem. The two forms {{are based on the}} thermodynamic similarity <b>of</b> matter and <b>antimatter</b> and differ only in the directions of thermodynamic time for matter and antimatter (the same in the time-symmetric case and the opposite in the time-antisymmetric case). We demonstrate that, while the symmetric form of PME predicts an equi-balance between matter and antimatter, the antisymmetric form of PME favours full conversion <b>of</b> <b>antimatter</b> into matter. At this stage, it is impossible to make an experimentally justified choice in favour of the symmetric or antisymmetric versions of thermodynamics since we have no experience of thermodynamic properties <b>of</b> macroscopic objects <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>antimatter,</b> but experiments <b>of</b> this kind may become possible in the future.

However, even in 1958 the theoretical flaws in the hypothesis were observed, aside from the evidence that was coming in at the same time from the first gamma ray measurement satellites. For one, the hypothesis did not explain how an antimatter meteor could have managed to survive that low into the Earth's atmosphere, without being annihilated as soon as it encountered terrene matter at the upper levels.|$|R

40|$|The {{simplest}} electrical {{neutral system}} <b>made</b> entirely <b>of</b> <b>antimatter</b> is the antihydrogen atom ((H) over bar (0)) {{consisting of a}} positron (e(+)) orbiting an antiproton ((p) over bar). The first (H) over bar (0) atoms produced in (p) over bar - A collisions at the Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR) at CERN have been observed in 1995 [1] and were confirmed thereafter at Fermilab [2]. However, low production rates and high velocity <b>of</b> these exotic <b>atoms</b> <b>made</b> it impossible to even think of using them for high precision spectroscopy or studies of the gravitational interaction. At the Antiproton Decelerator (AD) of CERN trap experiments are in operation, where cold (H) over bar (0) atoms are synthesized "at rest" starting from clouds of P's and e's trapped at temperatures of a few Kelvin. Only if the produced (H) over bar (0) atoms once are trapped in a magnetic field arrangement meaningful studies call be done.

We have recently demonstrated trapping of antihydrogen atoms by releasing them after a confinement time of 172 ms. A critical question for future studies is: how long can anti-atoms be trapped? Here we report the observation of anti-atom confinement for 1000 s, extending our earlier results by nearly four orders of magnitude. Our calculations indicate that most of the trapped anti-atoms reach the ground state. Further, we report the first measurement of the energy distribution of trapped antihydrogen which, coupled with detailed comparisons with simulations, provides a key tool for the systematic investigation of trapping dynamics. These advances open up a range of experimental possibilities, including precision studies of CPT symmetry and cooling to temperatures where gravitational effects could become apparent.

Although quite young, remarkable {{progress has been made}} in this field over the past decade, especially given the interest in building a quantum computer using superconducting circuits. In this thesis based on the appended papers, we look at generation, engineering and detection of microwave photons using superconducting circuits. We do this by taking advantage of the strong coupling, on-chip tunability and huge nonlinearity available in superconducting circuits. First, we present the strong photon-photon interaction measured experimentally, as shown in the giant cross-Kerr effect. In this work, conditional phase shift of about 20 degrees per photon was measured between two coherent fields at single photon level. Given this strong interaction, we propose and analyze a cascaded setup based on the cross-Kerr effect to detect itinerant microwave photons, a long outstanding problem with only recent experimental realizations. We show that a nondestructive detection of microwave photons is possible with few cascaded transmons. The on-chip tunability of Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) is exploited to create a tunable superconducting resonator in the next presented experimental work. Finally, we show that by placing the atom at the end of a transmission line, microwave photons can be generated efficiently and on-demand.
