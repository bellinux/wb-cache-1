5|$|After the {{establishment}} of independent Czechoslovakia in 1918, the country kept the gun law of 1852 (see above), i.e. the citizens {{had the right to}} possess firearms and needed to obtain a permit in order to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> them.|$|E
5|$|The {{stems of}} most cacti are some shade of green, often bluish or {{brownish}} green. Such stems contain chlorophyll and are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out photosynthesis; {{they also have}} stomata (small structures that can open and close to allow passage of gases). Cactus stems are often visibly waxy.|$|E
5|$|While {{induction}} {{entails the}} transient activation of CaMKII and PKC, maintenance of E-LTP (early-form LTP) {{is characterized by}} their persistent activation. During this stage, PKMz (Protein kinase Mζ) which does not have dependence on calcium, become autonomously active. Consequently, they are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out the phosphorylation events that underlie E-LTP expression.|$|E
50|$|In 1898, the Norwegian Society of Friends {{became a}} private {{religious}} organisation, {{which meant that}} the organisation was no longer subject to the act on dissenters. The society accepted new members and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out funerals and marriages.|$|R

5|$|An {{unprecedented}} {{event was}} {{the visit of}} Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, who arrived incognito in Rome on March 6 and was allowed to enter the conclave. He stayed there two weeks, freely debating with the electors. Fortunately, he did not press them but only expressed the wish for {{the election of a}} pope who would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out his duties with the proper respect for the secular rulers.|$|E
5|$|At any rate, Philip {{chose to}} build lembi. These were the small fast galleys {{used by the}} Illyrians. They had a single bank of oars and were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> 50 {{soldiers}} {{in addition to the}} rowers. With these, Philip could hope to avoid or evade the Roman fleet, preoccupied as he hoped it would be with Hannibal, and based, as it was, at Lilybaeum in western Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{having a}} main {{military}} goal of deterrence, strategists envisioned the Swiss nuclear strike capability {{as part of}} a preemptive war against the Soviets. The Swiss Air Force Mirage III jet would have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> nuclear bombs as far as Moscow. They also suggested the weapons could be used on Swiss soil against a possible invading force.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, the Iraqi, Kurdish and US governments {{came to the}} {{consensus}} that these types of reparations to the Kurdish people would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>carried</b> out without further negotiations and political agreements on boundaries.|$|R

The capture of the brigantine is specially fortunate, as I have failed to come across any native craft as I had hoped to do, but with this extra accommodation we shall be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manage <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> off all the slaves. I see by your account that Mr. Glover had the marines as well as his own twenty men." ...|$|R
50|$|As of January 1, 2016, {{holders of}} a Texas CHL or LTC are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> openly <b>carry</b> handguns {{in the same}} places that allow {{concealed}} carry with some exceptions. Openly carried handguns must be in a shoulder or belt holster.|$|R
5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion meant {{that it would not}} have to be painted to protect it from the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> a higher revenue load for the same cost.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 Inventario Sanitario Rural (ISR) or Rural Sanitary Register {{confirms}} that situation. Only 21% {{of the rural}} community organizations were considered <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out maintenance and only 10% to commercially operate the service. Only 32% issued bills and only 10% used metering. In 2005, the government defined guidelines for basic {{water supply and sanitation}} policy in rural areas to increase coverage and improve quality in those areas.|$|E
5|$|The Polish–Lithuanian and Prussian {{alliance}} was {{a mutual}} defense alliance signed on 29 March 1790 in Warsaw between {{representatives of the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Kingdom of Prussia. It was signed in the brief period when Prussia was seeking an ally against either Austria or Russia, and the Commonwealth was seeking guarantees {{that it would be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out significant governmental reforms without foreign intervention.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, a {{woman will}} suffer a {{miscarriage}} early in pregnancy, yet the pregnancy will continue; one twin was miscarried {{but the other}} was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>carried</b> <b>to</b> term. This occurrence {{is similar to the}} vanishing twin syndrome, but typically occurs later, as the twin is not reabsorbed.|$|R
50|$|The Connection was {{abruptly}} canceled {{after the}} August 5, 2005 broadcast, and Gordon laid off.

50|$|The two pilots sat {{side by side}} in an {{enclosed}} cockpit, while behind them sat the Flight engineer (on the left) and radio operator (on the right). Behind the cockpit, there was normally seating for 20-30 passengers, with up <b>to</b> 38 being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>carried</b> over short ranges.|$|R
5|$|The {{previous}} Causeway {{had carried}} electric trams, {{and it was}} expected that the new Causeway would also carry trams, or perhaps trolleybuses instead. However, the proposed overhead wires were deemed too ugly for the new bridge, and between £30,000 and £40,000 could be saved by using buses instead. The routes using the Causeway were replaced with bus services, but the bridges as constructed were nonetheless designed to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> trams.|$|E
5|$|The {{rearward}} {{of the two}} ports {{was fitted}} with plumbing to allow the station to be refueled by unmanned Progress spacecraft. These freighters, which brought supplies and extra equipment to keep the station replenished, helped ensure that the crew were always <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out useful scientific work aboard the station. In all, twelve Progress flights delivered over 20tonnes of equipment, supplies and fuel.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been {{dramatic}} changes in telephone communication behind the scenes. Starting with the operation of TAT-8 in 1988, the 1990s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of communicating with optic fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity. TAT-8 itself was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> 10 times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid {{at that time and}} today's optic fibre cables are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> 25 times as many telephone calls as TAT-8. This increase in data capacity is due to several factors: First, optic fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from crosstalk which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable. Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data capacity of a single fibre.|$|E

50|$|As to the defendant’s {{argument}} that the plaintiff’s claim was barred by the Statute of Frauds, {{the court held that}} the alleged agreement did not violate the Statute of Frauds, as it was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be <b>carried</b> out within the one-year period for oral contracts mandated by statute in New York.|$|R
5000|$|The Employment Appeal Tribunal {{held that}} Mr Rowan ‘would have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{adequately}} <b>carry</b> out {{the bulk of}} the job of sales assistant, and such parts as he could not carry out could easily have been done by other sales assistants without causing any inconvenience or difficulty for the appellants.’ ...|$|R
5|$|A {{large number}} of bombers only began {{receiving}} their warning and diversion orders at 00:45 hours. Halifaxes of No. 4 Group were finally alerted at this time. It {{was too late to}} prevent the Ju 88s from sighting, and then homing in on a mass of landing lights. Crews from NJG 2 and NJG 4 were able to deliver beam and Schräge Musik attacks against the unwary crews. Pilots that were alerted in time were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out a corkscrew manoeuvre, and evade the attack. Some bombers were able to land but were then subjected to strafing attacks and destroyed though the crews were presented with a greater chance to escape.|$|E
5|$|Boycott's commentating career continued, however, {{as he was}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> {{on working}} overseas, {{particularly}} in India. He hosted The Sunny and Boycs Show with Sunil Gavaskar and he hosted the touring Indian team {{at his home in}} August 2002. He worked in South Africa and coached the Pakistan cricket team upon request. In 2001, as resentment towards him in the British media following the court case died down, he was reinstated as a writer for British newspapers, and there was speculation that he would lead Lancashire Cricket Club following the departure of Bobby Simpson, though Mike Watkinson eventually took the role.|$|E
5|$|Frahm {{anti-roll}} {{tanks were}} fitted during construction, but these {{proved to be}} ineffective; the tanks only reduced rolling by 33%. Bilge keels were later added to improve stability, and the space previously used for the anti-roll tanks was instead used as extra fuel storage. The ship was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> an additional 180 t(200 short tons) of coal in the anti-roll tanks. Von der Tanns hull consisted of 15 watertight compartments, and a double bottom extended for 75% of the ship's length. The ship was known to have good maneuvering characteristics, with a speed loss of 60% and a heel of 8degrees at full rudder.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that in the}} {{expansion}} of the crack opening displacement vs distance from the tip, there is no linear term present.

40|$|Protein {{includes}} many substances, such as enzymes, hormones and antibodies {{that are necessary}} for the organisms. Living cells are controlled by proteins and genes that interact through complex molecular pathways to achieve a specific function. These proteins have different shapes and structures which distinct them from each other. By having unique structures, only proteins <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carried</b> out their function efficiently. Therefore, determination of protein structure is fundamental for {{the understanding of the}} cell's functions. The function of a protein is also largely determined by its structure. The importance of understanding protein structure has fueled the development of protein structure databases and prediction tools. Computational methods which were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> predict protein structure for the determination of protein function efficiently and accurately are in high demand. In this study, local protein structure with Support Vector Machine is proposed to predict protein secondary structure...|$|R

5|$|In 1975, the South Glamorgan County Council leased {{the island}} for the next 99 years. In March 1995, the county council agreed to obtain Flat Holm through a 50-year lease from the Crown Estate {{starting}} on 12 December 1995. Flat Holm is now designated as a Local Nature Reserve, as stipulated in that lease. It is managed by the Cardiff Council as The Flat Holm Project. The project team operates the Lewis Alexander, a boat which was purpose-built for the crossing to Flat Holm and which is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> up to 45 passengers and essential supplies to the island. The work of the Flat Holm Project {{is supported by the}} registered charity the Flat Holm Society.|$|E
5|$|In September 1785, the Barbaulds left Palgrave {{for a tour}} of France; Rochemont's {{mental health}} had been deteriorating and {{he was no longer}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out his {{teaching}} duties. In 1787, they moved to Hampstead, where Rochemont was asked to serve as the minister at what later became Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel. It was here that Barbauld became close friends with Joanna Baillie, the playwright. Although no longer in charge of a school, the Barbaulds did not abandon their commitment to education; they often had one or two pupils living with them, who had been recommended by personal friends.|$|E
5|$|Pohl's {{tenure as}} fleet {{commander}} was brief; by January 1916 hepatic cancer had weakened {{him to the}} point where he was no longer <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out his duties. He was replaced by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer in January. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5 to 7 March, with an uneventful sweep of the Hoofden. Kaiserin was also present during an advance to the Amrun Bank on 2 to 3 April. The fleet conducted another sortie on 21 to 22 April.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of air quality in the City of Naples (Campania Region-Italy). The research aim is to make {{an introduction to the}} preliminary analysis of the particles less than 10 mm in diameter (PM 10) by focusing on the correlation between the PM 10 and the climatic variables (wind, temperature, mm and days of rain) and between the PM 10 and the traffic. Moreover the research focuses also on the effect of the adopted traffic regulation strategies by the municipality in the city of Naples. In order <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carried</b> out, in future research, a model for the PM 10 prediction, the main endogenous variables to involve in the model are identified.
