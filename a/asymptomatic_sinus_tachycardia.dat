40|$|OBJECTIVE The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the value of activation mapping for radiofrequency modification of the sinus node and the long-term success rate of the procedure in a series of patients with inappropriate <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia.</b> BACKGROUND: The results of radiofrequency ablation of inappropriate <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia</b> have been reported in only a small number of patients. METHODS: The subjects of this study were 29 consecutive drug-refractory patients who underwent catheter ablation of inappropriate <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia.</b> Target sites were selected by activation mapping during <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia.</b> RESULTS: The ablation procedure was successful acutely in reducing the baseline sinus rate to 20 % in 22 of 29 patients (76 %). In 13 of 22 patients (59 %) with a successful acute outcome, successive applications of radiofrequency energy at the site of earliest endocardial activation resulted in a cranial-caudal migration of earliest endocardial activation from the high lateral right atrium, along with a step-wise reduction in heart rate. In the other nine patients (41 %) with a successful acute outcome, the reduction in sinus rate occurred abruptly, unaccompanied by migration of the site of earliest activation. Symptoms due to inappropriate <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia</b> recurred at a mean of 4. 4 ±; 3 months after the ablation procedure in 6 of 22 patients (27 %). After additional procedures in three patients, symptoms of inappropriate <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia</b> ultimately were successfully eliminated over the long-term in 19 of 29 patients (66 %).

40|$|Introduction: Inappropriate <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia</b> is {{generally}} {{defined as an}} elevated resting heart rate (> 90 – 100 bpm) with an exaggerated response to physical or emotional stress and a clearly sinus mechanism which is not secondary to a diagnosed somatic disease. Anxiety, a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is recently recognized as a crucial issue in younger and older adults, with a causal relation to other risk factors, such as depression, substance use, overweight, sleep difficulties, or a sedentary life style. The aim of the study was to evaluate a possible relation between the level of anxiety, control of emotions in patients with manifestation of inappropriate <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia</b> and diagnosis of this syndrome. Material and methods: The study included 33 female patients with inappropriate <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia</b> (age range 31. 8  ±  8. 72) and 33 women (28. 7  ±  4. 4) without any cardiac diseases. The diagnosis of inappropriate <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia</b> was given by a cardiologist during hospitalisation of the patients in the  2 nd Department of Cardiology and Department of Electrocardiology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland. For psychological assessment the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Courtauld Emotional Control Scale both self-report, paper and pencil inventories were used. Results: A statistically {{significant difference was found}} between the group of women with inappropriate <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia</b> and the group of healthy women regarding the Anxiety-Trait. The results of the study have shown no other statistically significant differences between tested groups. Conclusions: Inappropriate <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia</b> is related to increased anxiety.

40|$|JENKINS, J., ET AL. : A single atrial extrastimulus can {{distinguish}} <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia</b> from 1 : 1 paroxysmal tachycardia. We {{have developed a}} tachycardia detection scheme/or use in an anfitachycardia pacemaker in which the use ofa properly timed atriaJ exlrasfimuJus provides a means o/discriminating sinus tachy-cardia from pace-terminable 1 : 1 tachycardias. An atriai extrastimulus is delivered in late diastole (80 ms premature), and the ventricular response is monitored. In <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia,</b> the ventricular response is expected to appear early as well, but in pace-terminable tachycardias, such as AV reentrant and ventricular with VA conduction, the ventricular rhythm will be unperturbed. Testing of the algorithm was performed in 34 patients. In 29 patients, atrial extrastimuli were delivered during <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia,</b> and in 22 patientsduring various types o/ 1 : 1 paroxysmal tachycardia. In one patient the procedure was completely automated, i. e., delivery of the atrial extrastimuli and diagnosis were microcomputer controlled. In 28 / 29 cases, the delivery of an atrial extrastimulus 80 to 120 ms early during <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia</b> elicited a ven-tricular response at least 28 ms early. In 22 / 22 patients with 1 : 1 paroxysmal tachycardia, atrial extrastimuli 80 to 120 ms early failed io produce {{a significant change in}} ventricular cycle length. This technique appears to be promising for prevention of inadvertent pacing of <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia</b> in an antitachycardia pacemaker.

40|$|<b>Sinus</b> <b>tachycardia</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} after radiofrequency catheter ablation of supraventricular tachycardia. Frequently, these patients require beta-blocking agents for symptomatic control. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate prospectively the incidence of inappropriate <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia</b> and heart rate variability after ablation of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and accessory pathways. Patients undergoing ablation had 24 -h ambulatory monitoring ECG (Hotter) performed before the procedure, on the day of the ablation, and 3 months afterwards. There were 170 patients, mean age 48 ± 23 years; 93 were female. A complete study of the 24 -h Hotter with analysis of heart rate variability: SD, rMSSD, pNN 50, high and low frequency was obtained. There was a low prevalence of inappropriate <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia</b> after the ablation procedure (10 of 170 patients: five with four atrioventricular nodal reentry, with posteroseptal accessory pathways and one of the latter following ablation of the left accessory pathway). There was no modification of time and frequency domain parameters of heart rate variability in the remaining patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation. Hotter monitoring 3 months after ablation showed that parameters of heart rate and heart rate variability had normalized in patients who had developed inappropriate <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia.</b> Inappropriate <b>sinus</b> <b>tachycardia</b> may be initiated by both radiofrequency ablation of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and radiofrequency ablation of posteroseptal accessory pathways. Specific damage to the posteroseptal region is responsible for these changes, which usually recover spontaneously after 3 months...|$|R
