5|$|Mole {{suffered}} a heart attack in 1896, likely due to excessive work and the ensuing illness lead to her taking <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> from organisational work the following year. Her son, Fred, died in 1905. On 15 April 1912, whilst on holiday in Paris, Mole died.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} years of the 20th century, Boyce had become a multi-millionaire and had taken <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> from his {{businesses}} to pursue his interests in civic affairs, devoting more time to traveling and participating in expeditions. In 1909, he embarked on a two-month trip to Europe and a large photographic expedition to Africa with photographer George R. Lawrence and cartoonist John T. McCutcheon. Over the next two decades, Boyce led expeditions to South America, Europe, and North Africa, where he visited the newly discovered tomb of King Tutankhamun.|$|E
5|$|James VI's {{inheritance}} of the English crown in 1603 led to rule via the Privy Council from London. He also increasingly controlled the {{meetings of the}} Scottish General Assembly and increased the number and powers of the Scottish bishops. In 1618, he held a General Assembly and pushed through Five Articles, which included practices that had been retained in England but largely abolished in Scotland, most controversially kneeling for the reception of communion. Although ratified, they created widespread opposition and resentment and were {{seen by many as}} <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> to Catholic practice.|$|E

5|$|In one draft, Picard kills Data {{early in}} the film, and the android is later resurrected to help the Captain in the finale. The first two drafts {{featured}} the Romulans as the protagonists, since they had never prominently appeared in a Star Trek film. The second draft was seen by Jonathan Dolgen at the studio; Dolgen was not pleased and Patrick Stewart {{thought that it would}} have been only suitable for a television episode. In the third draft, the Son'a were introduced as the children of the Ba'ku and the alien race that wanted to plunder the planet. That version also included the crew sub-plots, such as the Troi-Riker romance and the regeneration of La Forge's eyes. Stewart, who was concerned that the film was <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> in scope from First Contact, was consulted on the treatments.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Har Gobind Khorana and {{co-workers}} developed a phosphodiester method where 3’-O-acetylnucleoside-5’-O-phosphate 2 (Scheme 3) was activated with N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or 4-toluenesulfonyl chloride (Ts-Cl). The activated species were reacted with a 5’-O-protected nucleoside 1 {{to give a}} protected dinucleoside monophosphate 3. Upon the removal of 3’-O-acetyl group using base-catalyzed hydrolysis, further chain elongation was carried out. Following this methodology, sets of tri- and tetradeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized and were enzymatically converted to longer oligonucleotides, which allowed elucidation of the genetic code. The major limitation of the phosphodiester method consisted {{in the formation of}} pyrophosphate oligomers and oligonucleotides branched at the internucleosidic phosphate. The method seems to be <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> from the more selective chemistry described earlier; however, at that time, most phosphate-protecting groups available now had not yet been introduced. The lack of the convenient protection strategy necessitated taking a retreat to a slower and less selective chemistry to achieve the ultimate goal of the study.|$|E

25|$|The 1981–82 season {{represented}} <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> for {{the franchise}} as the Cents ended up second to {{last in the}} Interior Division with an abysmal record of 11–35–2. Remarkably, the Vernon Lakers had a worse record, finishing three points behind the Centennials. Merritt was overmatched by BCJHL leading scorer Ray Ferraro and his Penticton Knights in the Interior Division semifinals, going out in four straight games.|$|E
25|$|I have {{preferred}} to not let this diagnosis {{get in the way}} of getting on with life. I feel a deep frustration at this new roadblock, as I now have to take <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> and undergo treatment. The band means so much to me, and cancelling the tour has been a very sad decision. I am hopeful that in the near future we will be back on the road again playing music we love.|$|E

50|$|The {{structure}} was originally commissioned by Joseph S. Cullinan founder of The Texas Company {{to house the}} offices of his growing oil and gas business. Designed by New York Architect Alfred Bossom, the building features Art Deco styling with unusual Mayan touches including reliefs and <b>a</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> style on upper floors to mimic a Mayan pyramid. This Mayan influenced design would be re-imagined 50 years later with the similarly styled Heritage Plaza building finished in 1987.|$|R
25|$|The 1986–87 season {{represented}} <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> for the Warriors as {{the team}} won just 10 games, but remarkably it {{was good enough to}} put them in the playoffs as the Summerland Buckaroos finished with nine points fewer in last place in both the BCJHL and the Interior Division. This time it would be Kelowna Packers who sent the Warriors packing in the Interior semifinals and Merritt was swept in the first playoff round for the second straight season.|$|E
25|$|Nadia Comăneci {{needed a}} score of 9.925 to tie or more than that to win the gold outright. The last time she had scored as high as this in an AA final was at the 76 Olympics. Out of the 100 {{optional}} beam exercises performed at the 1980 Olympics only 1 scored as high as Comaneci needed. After one of her back flips Comaneci had to flail her arms for balance. She broke the connection between her aerial walkover to aerial cartwheel with a pause. Her knee bent slightly under 360-degree rotation. She landed slightly askew, taking <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> (normally a 0.1 deduction).|$|E
25|$|The team took <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> in 2005 with a 6–10 record. McNabb {{had played}} with a sports hernia and a broken thumb, {{starting}} 4–2 but losing three in a row, before McNabb finally succumbs to injury and {{is out for the}} rest of the season. For obnoxious behavior and a feud with McNabb, Owens was suspended after 7 games, eventually being cut. In 2006, the team lost McNabb 10 games in and went into turmoil, but Westbrook stepped up, and the Eagles earned their fifth NFC East title under Coach Reid, with a 10–6 record and a win in the wild card round, but they had an 8–8 2007 season. In 2008, the team won their 500th game, and they also drafted DeSean Jackson, a receiving threat when paired with McNabb.|$|E

25|$|Linn {{introduced}} {{the successor to}} his revolutionary machine in 1982. The LinnDrum, often erroneously called the LM-2 (LM-1 stood for Linn/Moffett/1 and Moffett wasn't with the company {{by the time the}} LinnDrum came around), contained more sounds (including cymbals), more options for programming sounds (step programming mode), and 5 programmable trigger inputs, but was <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> from the LM-1 in that it removed the ability to tune all of the individual drum sounds (hi-hat, bass, cowbell, tambourine, sidestick, and many other sounds were no longer tunable). It retailed for $2,500 less than the original LM-1 and although it added some additional features, the cost-cutting measures were quite notable. Although the LinnDrum helped make electronic drums more affordable for the common musician, it is still not as revered as the LM-1 and generally {{can be found on the}} used market for much less.|$|E
25|$|Poincaré {{states that}} {{mathematics}} (analysis) and physics {{are in the}} same spirit, that the two disciplines share a common aesthetic goal and that both can liberate humanity from its simple state. In a more pragmatic way, the interdependence of physics and mathematics is similar to his proposed relationship between intuition and analysis. The language of mathematics not only permits one to express scientific advancements, but also to take <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> to comprehend the broader world of nature. Mathematics demonstrates the extent of the specific and limited discoveries made by physicists. On the other hand, physics has a key role for the mathematician - a creative role since it presents atypical problems ingrained in reality. In addition, physics offers solutions and reasoning - thus the development of infinitesimal calculus by Isaac Newton within the framework of Newtonian mechanics.|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} few years, {{researchers}} seem to have shifted their focus from detecting, locating, and sequencing copy number variations to in depth analyses {{of the role of}} these copy number variations in the human genome and in nature in general. Evidence is needed to further validate the relationship between copy number variations and gene families as well as the role that natural selection plays in shaping these relationships and changes. Furthermore, researchers are also aiming to elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in copy number variations as it may reveal essential information regarding structural variations in general. Taking <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back,</b> the area of structural variation in the human genome seems to be a rapidly growing research topic. Not only can these research data provide additional evidence for evolution and natural selection, it {{can also be used to}} develop treatments for a wide range of genetic diseases.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{were mixed}} in their {{opinions}} on the gameplay, some considering it too complex and some too simple. Carden criticized the difficulty in reaching the different endings without following a guide, and how it sometimes is unclear what the effects of some player choices will be; Fenner did however find it fun and compelling to use knowledge from one playthrough {{to go back and}} make different choices while aiming for another ending. Rogan disliked how the player choice system was simpler than the one in Steins;Gate, calling it <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> for the series, and Helm thought that the player choices lacked the tension and regret of the original game's. Fenner appreciated how the RINE system improved upon the text messages from the previous game, allowing the player to see what exact message they would send prior to sending it while simultaneously automatically saving the game. Carden, Rogan and Helm appreciated the Tips system, considering it a helpful way to make sure that players understand concepts and terms discussed in the game.|$|E
25|$|The 2014 {{season was}} <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> {{on the track}} for Cheptai, as she {{finished}} lowly in Diamond League races and failed to improve her bests. She did make progress in road running, however, coming second at the Groningen Four-Mile Run and Nairobi Diamond 10K Run, setting a best of 31:45 minutes at the latter. She began training with Turkish athletics club Üsküdar Belediyesi and brought the club victory in the individual and team categories at the European Champion Clubs Cup Cross Country. After winning the Discovery Kenya Cross Country, Cheptai was again selected for the Kenyan team for the 2015 IAAF World Cross Country Championships and reached a new high in seventh place, winning the team silver medals with Kenya. On the 2015 IAAF Diamond League circuit, she placed in the top six of the 5000m at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix, Prefontaine Classic and Bislett Games. A runner-up finish to Viola Kibiwott at the 2015 Athletics Kenya World Championship Trials earned her a place on her first senior track team for Kenya.|$|E

5000|$|... the idealisation of male {{friendship}} as {{superior to}} male-female love (which was considered not romantic or compassionate but merely lustful, hence inferior) performs {{a project of}} cultural nostalgia, <b>a</b> <b>stepping</b> <b>back</b> from potentially more threatening social arrangements to a world of order, a world based on a 'gift' economy of personal relations among male social equals rather than one based on a newer, less stable economy of emotional and economic risk. The offer of the woman from one male friend to another would therefore be the highest expression of friendship from one point of view, a low point of psycho-sexual regression from another.|$|R

There is about Yuba Bill this air of a pugnacious calm, <b>a</b> <b>stepping</b> <b>back</b> to get his {{distance}} for a shattering blow, which is like that of Dr. Johnson at his best. And the effect is inexpressively increased by the background and the whole picture which Bret Harte paints so powerfully; the stormy skies, the sombre gorge, the rocking and spinning coach, and high above the feverish passengers the huge dark form of Yuba Bill, a silent mountain of humour.|$|R
