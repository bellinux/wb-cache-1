5|$|Some {{signal lights}} use a {{luminous}} paint, containing a phosphor that absorbs the beta radiation emitted by promethium-147 and emits light. This isotope {{does not cause}} <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phosphor, as alpha emitters do, and therefore the light emission is stable for a few years. Originally, radium-226 {{was used for the}} purpose, but it was later replaced by promethium-147 and tritium (hydrogen-3). Promethium may be favored over tritium for nuclear safety reasons.|$|E
5|$|Meyer added {{elements}} {{to reinforce the}} <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters. Kirk's unhappiness about his birthday is compounded by McCoy's gift of reading glasses. The script stated that Kirk was 49, but Shatner was unsure about being specific about Kirk's age. Bennett remembers that Shatner was hesitant about portraying a middle-aged version of himself, and believed that with proper makeup he could continue playing a younger Kirk. Bennett convinced Shatner that he could age gracefully like Spencer Tracy; the producer {{did not know that}} Shatner had worked with Tracy on Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), and was fond of the actor. Meyer made sure to emphasize Kirk's parallel to Sherlock Holmes in that both characters waste away in the absence of their stimuli; new cases, in Holmes' case, and starship adventures in Kirk's.|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{the hospice}} {{industry}} has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied the AIDS epidemic and the <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with Medicare certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non-profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, {{according to the}} National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System, hospice sites are expanding at a national rate of about 3.5% per year. In 2007, 1.4 {{million people in the}} United States used hospice, with more than one-third of dying Americans using the service, approximately 39%. In 2008, Medicare alone, which pays for 80% of hospice treatment, paid $10 billion to the 4,000 Medicare-certified providers in the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{asymmetry}} {{between the}} Earth {{and the space}} ship is manifested in this diagram {{by the fact that}} more blue-shifted (fast aging) images are received by the ship.

25|$|A notable {{exception}} to normative medieval eschatology {{is found in}} Joachim of Fiore (c. 1135–1202), a Cistercian monk, who to an extent, stressed premillennial themes.

25|$|The {{decline in}} {{membership}} of the SBC was an issue discussed during the June 2008 Annual Convention. Curt Watke, a former researcher for the SBC, noted four reasons for {{the decline of the}} SBC based on his research: the increase in immigration by non-European groups, decline in growth among predominantly European American (white) churches, the <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current membership, and a decrease in the percentage of younger generations participating in any church life. Some believe that the Baptists have not worked sufficiently to attract minorities.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue in}} Ybor City after World War II was the <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area’s housing stock.

25|$|Individuals with lightly {{pigmented}} skin who are repeatedly exposed to strong UV radiation, experience faster <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skin, which shows in increased wrinkling and anomalies of pigmentation. Oxidative damage causes {{the degradation of}} protective tissue in the dermis, which confers {{the strength of the}} skin. It has been postulated that white women may develop wrinkles faster after menopause than black women because they are more susceptible to the lifetime damage of the sun through life. Dr. Taylor, of Yale University School of Medicine, concluded that the study could not prove the findings but they suspect the underlying cause. Light-coloured skin has been suspected {{to be one of the}} contributing factors that promote wrinkling.|$|E

25|$|Approximately 27 million Americans, {{or nearly}} 11% of the population, have diabetes, {{according}} to the American Diabetes Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By 2050, the prevalence of diabetes could increase {{to as much as}} 33% of the population, largely due to the <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population and to people with diabetes living longer. Approximately 1.9 million new cases of diabetes are diagnosed each year. The disease was the seventh leading cause of death in 2007, directly claiming more than 71,000 lives and contributing to approximately 160,000 additional deaths. Patients with diabetes are two to four times more likely than those without it to die from cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is an important cause of blindness, kidney disease, and lower-extremity amputations.|$|E
25|$|Causes {{parallel}} the evolutionary changes {{occurring in the}} US medical system: payment based on quantity of services delivered, not quality; <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population increases the prevalence and complexity of chronic health conditions, {{most of which are}} handled in primary care settings; and increasing emphasis on life-style changes and preventative measures, often poorly covered by health insurance or not at all. In 2004, the median income of specialists in the US was twice that of PCPs, and the gap is widening. Discontent by practicing primary care internists is discouraging trainees from entering primary care; in a 2007 survey of 1,177 graduating US medical students, only 2% planned to enter a general internal medicine career, and lifestyle was emphasized over the higher subspecialty pay in their decision. Primary care practices in the United States increasingly depend on foreign medical graduates to fill depleted ranks.|$|E
