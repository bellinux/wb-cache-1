2500|$|Delayed {{hemolytic}} reactions occur {{more than}} 24 hours until 14 days <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>transfusion.</b> This {{is due to}} low amount of antibodies available during {{the start of the}} transfusion. Therefore, acute haemolytic reaction does not manifests until after 24 hours when enough amount of antibodies are available to cause a reaction. The red blood cells are removed by macrophages from the blood circulation into liver and spleen to be destroyed, which leads to extravascular haemolysis. This process usually mediated by anti-Rh and anti-Kidd antibodies. However, this type of transfusion reaction is less severe when compared to acute haemolytic transfusion reaction ...|$|R

25|$|The ABO {{blood group}} system {{is used to}} denote the {{presence}} of one, both, or neither of the A and B antigens on erythrocytes. In human blood transfusions {{it is the most}} important of the 35 different blood type (or group) classification systems currently recognized. A very rare (in modern medicine) mismatch in this, or any other serotype, can cause a serious, potentially fatal, adverse reaction <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>transfusion,</b> or <b>a</b> contra-indicated immune response to a organ transplant. The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually IgM antibodies, which are produced {{in the first years of}} life by sensitization to environmental substances, such as food, bacteria, and viruses. ABO blood types are also present in some other animals, for example rodents and apes, such as chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas.|$|R

Although blood transfusions {{are much more}} frequent and have many connotations, derived from religious values, mass culture, or personal ideas, there is no study of the perception the patients have of changes in their behavior and values <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>transfusion.</b> This study’s objective was to assess perceived changes in behavior and values <b>after</b> <b>a</b> red blood cell transfusion. Materials and methods: Exploratory study through semistructured interviews with seven adults transfused after orthopedic surgery. Results: Blood had strong symbolic values for all subjects. Each of the seven participants mentioned positive characteristics {{that they would like}} to receive from the donor. Six subjects out of the seven acknowledged the possibility that transfusions might induce changes in behavior or values. Three subjects clearly stated that they would refuse to receive blood from a criminal for fear that some negative characteristic may be transmitted to them. Furthermore, three subjects acknowledged that their transfusion might have changed their own behavior or values. Discussion: This study shows that patients might feel that transfusions could modify their behavior or values and that certain personality traits of the donor could be transmitted. Further research in a larger population is warranted to evaluate the incidence of a perceived changed in behavior or values <b>after</b> <b>a</b> blood <b>transfusion,</b> which would then lead to changes in the way information is provided to future patients requiring transfusions.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} ability of near infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS) to detect changes in tissue oxygenation due to alterations in oxygen delivery. Ten hemodynamically stable preterm neonates with a median gestational age of 27. 9 weeks (range 25. 1 - 31. 2), a median birth weight of 840 g (range 690 - 1310), and a postnatal age of 29 days (range 2 - 45) were included in this prospective trial. Tissue oxygenation of the lower leg was measured by NIRS and the oxygen extraction index (OEI) was calculated prior and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>transfusion</b> of 10 - 20 ml/kg body weight packed red blood cells. The OEI decreased from 0. 31 (range 0. 13 - 0. 39) to 0. 24 (range 0. 12 - 0. 36, p< 0. 005). This decrease correlated positively with the weight matched amount of packed red cell transfusion (r 2 = 0. 40, p< 0. 05) and with the increase in hematocrit (r 2 = 0. 58, p< 0. 005).
