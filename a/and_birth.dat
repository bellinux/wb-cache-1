5|$|Largely as {{a result}} of the {{influence}} of humans in sheep breeding, ewes often produce multiple lambs. This increase in the lamb births, both in number <b>and</b> <b>birth</b> weight, may cause problems in delivery and lamb survival, requiring the intervention of shepherds.|$|E

5|$|Before Stanton {{narrowed her}} {{political}} focus {{almost exclusively to}} women's rights, she was an active abolitionist with her husband Henry Brewster Stanton (co-founder of the Republican Party) and cousin Gerrit Smith.

Her concerns included women's parental and custody rights, property rights, employment and income rights, divorce, the economic health of the family, <b>and</b> <b>birth</b> control. She was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th-century temperance movement.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria is in a {{state of}} {{demographic}} crisis. It has had negative population growth since the early 1990s, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave. Some 937,000 to 1,200,000 people—mostly young adults—left the country by 2005. The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated in 2013 at 1.43 children born/woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. A third of all households consist of only one person and 75.5 percent of families do not have children under the age of 16. Consequently, population growth <b>and</b> <b>birth</b> rates are among the lowest in the world while death rates are among the highest. The majority of children are born to unmarried women (of all births 57.4 percent were outside marriage in 2012).|$|E
5|$|Daniel Boone {{was honored}} with a 6-cent stamp in the American Folklore Series on September 26, 1968, at Frankfort, Kentucky, {{where he was}} buried.

A wall of roughly-hewn boards displays the tools of Boone's trade—a Pennsylvania rifle, a powder horn, and a knife. The pipe tomahawk represents that the Shawnees had adopted Boone.

5|$|Dickinson started {{school at}} Manton Primary in Worksop while his parents moved away to Sheffield. Soon afterwards, {{when he was}} six, he was also {{despatched}} to Sheffield, where he attended a primary school in Manor Top. After six months, his parents decided to move him to a small private school called Sharrow Vale Junior. Due to constant moving, Dickinson states that this period of his life taught him to be self-reliant as {{he was unable to}} make close friends. Dickinson has a younger sister, professional showjumper , who was born in 1963. He tried to isolate himself from her {{as much as he could}} when he was young, supposedly out of spite because she, unlike him, was a planned pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>birth.</b>|$|E

Subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy has also been associated with gestational diabetes <b>and</b> <b>birth</b> of the baby before 37 weeks of pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the significant lack of genetic diversity in cheetahs is a cause of poor quality and production of sperm, <b>and</b> <b>birth</b> defects such as cramped teeth, kinked tails, and bent limbs. Cheetahs do have low fertility rates, but they appear to have flourished for thousands of years with these low levels of genetic variance. Cheetah expert Laurie Marker points out that the high level of genetic uniformity would mean that if an infectious disease surfaced in a population, all of them have (or lack) the same level of immunity. In 1982, 60% of the cheetah population in the Wildlife Safari (Oregon, United States) died due to a peritonitis epidemic.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{population}} {{is expected to}} drop to 95 million by 2050; demographers and government planners are currently in a heated debate over {{how to cope with}} this problem.

Japan accepts an average flow of 9,500 new Japanese citizens by naturalization (帰化) per year. According to the UNHCR, in 2012 Japan accepted just 18 refugees for resettlement, while the United States took in 76,000.|$|E

40|$|The {{high rates}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality arising from preterm <b>birth</b> <b>and</b> low <b>birth</b> weight impose an immense burden on the health, education and social services, and on families. This paper presents the results of a systematic review of the published and unpublished evidence regarding the long-term economic implications of preterm <b>birth</b> <b>and</b> low <b>birth</b> weight for various sectors of the economy and for individuals. The paper highlights the variable methodological quality of the bulk of long-term economic studies of preterm <b>birth</b> <b>and</b> low <b>birth</b> weight <b>and</b> suggests ways in which these methodological limitations can be overcome. The paper reveals that preterm <b>birth</b> <b>and</b> low <b>birth</b> weight can result in substantial costs to the health sector following the infant's initial discharge from hospital. It can also impose a substantial burden on special education and social services, on families and carers of the infants and on society generally. In addition to the costs identified by the literature, preterm <b>birth</b> <b>and</b> low <b>birth</b> weight can have other long-term consequences that require evaluation from an economic perspective. ...|$|R

5|$|Rice is the {{foundation}} of every meal, and is often eaten with fish broth, greens, beans or squash. Manioc and green bananas are staples most commonly eaten when other more preferable foods are too expensive or out of season. The Antankarana were historically herders and although they are now generally agriculturalists, cattle are kept for milk. They are also viewed as a form of wealth; the number of cattle one gives away indicates generosity, and the number sacrificed to the ancestors is a measure of loyalty. The sacrifice of zebu is a typical element of many major rituals and celebrations ranging from Muslim holidays to life events like marriage, death <b>and</b> <b>birth.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Elves {{view the}} sexual act as {{extremely}} special and intimate, for {{it leads to}} the conception <b>and</b> <b>birth</b> of children.

Yet separation during pregnancy or {{during the early years}} of parenthood (caused by war, for example) is so grievous to the couple that they prefer to have children in peaceful times. Living Elves cannot be raped or forced to have sex; before that they will lose the will to endure and go to Mandos.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} most cases of {{epilepsy}} is unknown. Some cases occur {{as the result}} of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, <b>and</b> <b>birth</b> defects, through a process known as epileptogenesis. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{policies of the}} New Deal leaders were often aligned with ACLU goals, but social goals were not.
