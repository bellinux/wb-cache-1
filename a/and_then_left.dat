5|$|The first {{large-scale}} organized sit-in was on Saturday, February 13, 1960. At about 12:30 pm, 124 students, {{most of them}} black, {{walked into}} the downtown Woolworths, S. H. Kress, and McClellan stores and asked to be served at the lunch counters. After the staff refused to serve them, {{they sat in the}} stores for two hours <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>left</b> without incident.|$|E
5|$|As the Mk. XIV could {{calculate}} {{the effects of}} a shallow climb or dive (or glide as it is referred to in bombing), the computor included its own levelling mechanism. This was added to the range angle calculated by the computor to move the sight head. Levelling the system required adjustment of both the computor and the sight head. Since these were in a fixed relationship to each other, levelling could be carried out on the ground <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>left</b> alone. Any adjustments required were recorded on a card fixed {{to the front of the}} computor.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, Cleburne and Hindman {{were both}} wounded by gunshots during a street fight in Helena {{with members of}} the Know-Nothing Party {{following}} a debate. Cleburne was shot in the back, turned around and shot one of his attackers, killing him. The attackers hid until Cleburne collapsed on the street <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>left.</b> After the two recovered, they appeared before a grand jury to respond to all charges brought against them. They were exonerated and, afterward, went to Hindman's parents' house in Mississippi. By 1860, he was a naturalized citizen, a practicing lawyer, and very popular with the local residents.|$|E

5|$|Montejo {{turned his}} {{attention}} east to Olancho, which had never been successfully conquered in spite of numerous earlier expeditions. Montejo marched there with his men, while sending messages requesting support from Cerezeda and García de Solís, the royal treasurer, but they refused and Montejo was forced to retreat back to Santa María de Comayagua. By 1539, the power struggle between Montejo and Pedro de Alvarado drew {{the attention of the}} Council of the Indies; as a result Alvarado once again became governor of Honduras. Alvarado returned to Honduras in April 1539; Montejo travelled to Gracias, where he was forced to concede the governorship, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>left</b> for Chiapas.|$|E
5|$|The second sit-in {{occurred}} on Thursday, February 18, {{when more than}} 200 students entered Woolworths, S. H. Kress, McClellan, and Grants. The lunch counters were immediately closed. The students remained for {{about half an hour}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>left,</b> again without incident. The third sit-in {{occurred on}} February 20 when about 350 students entered the previous four stores and the downtown Walgreens drugstore. As the students sat at the counters, crowds of white youths gathered in several of the stores. Police kept a watchful eye on all five locations, but no incidents of violence occurred. The students remained for nearly three hours until adjourning to a mass meeting at the First Baptist Church.|$|E
5|$|At 06:30, when Lawrence ordered Chauvel to take {{command of}} all mounted troops (excluding the Mobile Column), the New Zealand Mounted Rifles, the 5th Mounted and the 3rd Light Horse Brigades were {{somewhat}} scattered. By 08:30, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade had reached Bir en Nuss; there {{they found the}} 3rd Light Horse Brigade, which had been ordered to move first on Hamisah <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>left</b> towards Katia to cooperate in a general attack. The advance guard moved to fulfill these orders at 09:00. At 10:30, the general mounted advance began and by midday, was on a line from west of Bir Nagid to south of Katib Gannit; in the centre the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade were approaching the south-west edge of the Katia oasis; on their left the 1st, the 2nd Light Horse, the 5th Mounted Brigades and infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division were attacking Abu Hamra, {{to the north of}} the old caravan road, while the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was away to the New Zealander's right, south of the old caravan road, attacking German and Ottoman units at Bir el Hamisah.|$|E

5|$|Delaware {{was built}} by Newport News Shipbuilding; she was laid down on 11 November 1907, and {{launched}} on 6 January 1909. After completion of the fitting-out work, the ship was commissioned into the US Navy on 4 April 1910. On 3 October, she steamed to Wilmington, Delaware, where she received a set of silver service from her namesake state. The battleship then returned to Hampton Roads on the 9th, and remained there until she left to join the First Division, Atlantic Fleet, on 1 November. She {{and the rest of}} the division visited England and France, and then conducted maneuvers off Cuba in January 1911. On 17 January, a boiler explosion aboard Delaware killed eight men and badly scalded another. On 31 January, the ship carried the remains of Don Anibal Cruz, the Chilean ambassador to the United States, back to Chile. She steamed by way of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, around the tip of South America, to Punta Arenas, Chile. She returned to New York City on 5 May, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>left</b> for Portsmouth on 4 June to participate in the coronation fleet review for King George V.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi, at age 22, {{was called}} to the bar in June 1891 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>left</b> London for India, where he learned {{that his mother had}} died while he was in London and that his family had kept the news from him. His {{attempts}} at establishing a law practice in Bombay failed because he was psychologically unable to cross-examine witnesses. He returned to Rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but he was forced to stop when he ran foul of a British officer. In 1893, a Muslim merchant in Kathiawar named Dada Abdullah contacted Gandhi. Abdullah owned a large successful shipping business in South Africa. His distant cousin in Johannesburg needed a lawyer, and they preferred someone with Kathiawari heritage. Gandhi inquired about his pay for the work. They offered a total salary of £105 plus travel expenses. He accepted it, knowing that it would be at least one year commitment in the Colony of Natal, South Africa, also a part of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1644, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, the Chief Commander of the Parliamentary army, {{decided to}} reclaim the West Country. He moved through Dorset, retaking Dorchester and Weymouth, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>left</b> the coast and headed towards Chard. At the time, Taunton was held by a {{garrison}} of 800 men commanded by Colonel John Stawell, but {{the proximity of the}} Earl of Essex's army led the town to be abandoned, leaving only 80 men to defend the castle. The historian Robert Morris, in The Sieges of Taunton 1644–1645, suggests that Stawell and his men retreated to Bridgwater, but in The History of the Rebellion, the 17th-century historian Edward Hyde claims that the troops were requisitioned by Prince Maurice during his retreat from Lyme Regis to Plymouth.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} Middle Ages, poor {{transport}} forced self-sufficiency on small settlements. Lacking the urban centres created under the Romans {{in the rest}} of Britain, the economy of Scotland in the early Middle Ages was overwhelmingly agricultural. With a lack of significant transport links and wider markets, most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet of meat, dairy products and cereals, supplemented by hunter-gathering. Limited archaeological evidence indicates that throughout Northern Britain, farming was done on single homesteads or amongst a small cluster of three or four homes. Each of these probably contained a nuclear family, with kinship relationships likely to be common among neighbouring houses and settlements, reflecting the partition of land through inheritance. A system was adopted that distinguished between the infield, around the settlement, where crops were grown every year, and the outfield, further away, where crops were grown <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>left</b> fallow in different years. This would be the predominant system until the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} whether pterosaurs practiced any form of parental care, but their ability to fly {{as soon as they}} emerged from the egg and the {{numerous}} flaplings found in environments far from nests and alongside adults has led most researchers, including Christopher Bennett and David Unwin, to conclude that the young were dependent on their parents for {{a relatively short period of}} time, during a period of rapid growth while the wings grew long enough to fly, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>left</b> the nest to fend for themselves, possibly within days of hatching. Alternatively, they may have used stored yolk products for nourishment during their first few days of life, as in modern reptiles, rather than depend on parents for food.|$|E

Without significant transport links and wider markets, most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet of meat, dairy products and cereals, supplemented by hunter-gathering. Limited archaeological evidence indicates that throughout Northern Britain farming was based around a single homestead or a small cluster of three or four homes, each probably containing a nuclear family, with relationships likely to be common among neighbouring houses and settlements, reflecting the partition of land through inheritance. Farming became based around a system that distinguished between the infield around the settlement, where crops were grown every year and the outfield, further away and where crops were grown <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>left</b> fallow in different years, in a system that would continue until the 18th century. The evidence of bones indicates that cattle were by far the most important domesticated animal, followed by pigs, sheep and goats, while domesticated fowl were rare. Imported goods found in archaeological sites of the period include ceramics and glass, while many sites indicate iron and precious metal working.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the siege}} of Berat {{continued}} through the winter of 1280/1281. By early December, the Angevin forces had seized a number of outlying forts around the city and penetrated its suburbs. Charles, however, remained anxious to take the city before the Byzantine relief force arrived. He ordered his governors in Albania to direct all their resources towards the siege, and displayed his close interest {{by a series of}} letters to Sully, instructing him to take the city by assault if necessary. The Byzantine force advanced cautiously, and arrived in the area in early spring 1281. The megas domestikos Tarchaneiotes avoided a direct confrontation and relied on ambushes and raids instead. He also managed to resupply the besieged fortress with provisions, which were loaded onto rafts <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>left</b> to float down the river Osum which flows by the citadel.|$|E
5|$|The attackers {{then headed}} towards Cama Hospital with an {{intention}} to kill patients, but {{the hospital staff}} locked all of the patient wards. A team of the Mumbai Anti-Terrorist Squad led by police chief Hemant Karkare searched the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>left</b> in pursuit of Kasab and Khan. Kasab and Khan opened fire on the vehicle in a lane next to the hospital, and received return fire in response. Karkare, Vijay Salaskar, Ashok Kamte and one of their officers were killed. The only survivor, Constable Arun Jadhav, was severely wounded. Kasab and Khan seized the police vehicle but later abandoned it and seized a passenger car instead. They then ran into a police roadblock, which {{had been set up}} after Jadhav radioed for help. A gun battle then ensued in which Khan was killed and Kasab was wounded. After a physical struggle, Kasab was arrested. A police officer, Tukaram Omble was also killed when he ran in front of Kasab to shoot him.|$|E
5|$|Hearing gunfire in the distance, Hinton, {{wanting to}} assist in the defence of the Allied positions, went to the {{headquarters}} of Brigadier Leonard Parrington, the officer in command of the evacuation. Hinton vehemently protested, in strong language, an order from Parrington to surrender. On being threatened with a court-martial for speaking to a senior officer in such a manner, he issued his own threat of proceedings against Parrington for defeatist talk <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>left</b> to determine for himself the situation. Other men of the reinforcement battalion were making preparations to move into the town and face the Germans. In the meantime, Hinton had collected his own party of 12 soldiers and led them into the town but came under fire. Ignoring an order from a nearby officer to retreat, he rushed forward to the nearest enemy gun and, hurling two grenades, killed the crew. He continued towards the town's waterfront, clearing out two light machine-gun nests and a mortar with grenades, then dealt with the garrison of a house where some of the enemy were sheltering. He then assisted in the capture of an artillery piece, but shortly after was shot in the stomach, immobilised and captured, one of about 6,000 Allied soldiers made a prisoner of war (POW).|$|E
