25|$|Another {{example is}} the <b>affine</b> <b>space</b> concept: {{the idea of the}} <b>affine</b> <b>space</b> A {{underlying}} a vector space V can be said succinctly by saying that A is a principal homogeneous space for V acting as the additive group of translations.|$|E
25|$|The affine group acts transitively on {{the points}} of an <b>affine</b> <b>space,</b> and the {{subgroup}} V of the affine group (i.e., a vector space) transitive and free (i.e., regular) action on these points; indeed this {{can be used to}} give a definition of an <b>affine</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

25|$|The modern {{point of}} view makes all this intuition more precise using {{principal}} bundles (the essential idea is to replace a frame or a variable frame by the space of all frames and functions on this space). It also draws on the inspiration of Felix Klein's Erlangen programme, in which a geometry is defined to be a homogeneous space. <b>Affine</b> <b>space</b> is a geometry in this sense, and {{is equipped with a}} flat Cartan connection. Thus a general affine manifold is viewed as curved deformation of the flat model geometry of <b>affine</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{illustrates}} the subtle distinction between affine quantities (ones modeled by an <b>affine</b> <b>space,</b> such as position) and vector quantities (ones modeled by a vector space, such as displacement).|$|E
25|$|Just as {{with the}} regular {{functions}} on <b>affine</b> <b>space,</b> the regular functions on V form a ring, which we denote by k. This ring is called the coordinate ring of V.|$|E

50|$|When the {{projective}} {{spaces are}} defined by adding points at infinity to <b>affine</b> <b>spaces</b> (projective completion) the preceding formulas become, in affine coordinates,which generalizes {{the expression of the}} homographic function of the next section.

25|$|The plane {{may also}} {{be viewed as an}} <b>affine</b> <b>space,</b> whose isomorphisms are {{combinations}} of translations and non-singular linear maps. From this viewpoint there are no distances, but collinearity and ratios of distances on any line are preserved.|$|E
25|$|If n = 3 {{the set of}} the {{solutions}} is a plane in a three-dimensional space. More generally, the set of {{the solutions}} is an (n–1)-dimensional hyperplane in a n-dimensional Euclidean space (or <b>affine</b> <b>space</b> if the coefficients are complex numbers or belong to any field).|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} a Hilbert space, an orthogonal projection onto a closed subspace and {{a sequence of}} downwardly directed <b>affine</b> <b>spaces.</b> We give sufficient conditions for the projection of {{the intersection of the}} <b>affine</b> <b>spaces</b> into the closed subspace to be equal to the intersection of their projections. Under a closure assumption, one such (necessary and) sufficient condition is that summation and intersection commute between the orthogonal complement of the closed subspace, and the subspaces corresponding to the <b>affine</b> <b>spaces.</b> Another sufficient condition is that the cosines of the angles between the orthogonal complement of the closed subspace, and the subspaces corresponding to the <b>affine</b> <b>spaces,</b> be bounded away from one. Our results are then applied to a general infinite horizon, positive semi-definite, linear quadratic mathematical programming problem. Specifically, under suitable conditions, we show that optimal solutions exist and, modulo those feasible solutions with zero objective value, they are limits of optimal solutions to finite-dimensional truncations of the original problem...|$|R

25|$|Note that a {{projective}} space can be {{formed by the}} projectivization of a vector space, as lines through the origin, but cannot be formed from an <b>affine</b> <b>space</b> without a choice of basepoint. That is, affine spaces are open subspaces of {{projective space}}s, which are quotients of vector spaces.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, a metric space must be {{translationally}} invariant {{with respect}} to some (finite-dimensional) real vector space. This means that the space itself is an <b>affine</b> <b>space,</b> that the space is flat, not curved, and points do not have different properties, and so any point can be translated to any other point.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{advantages}} of the projective space compared with <b>affine</b> <b>space</b> (e.g., Pn(R) vs. An(R)). For these reasons {{it is important to}} know when a given manifold or variety is projective, i.e., embeds into (is a closed subset of) projective space. (Very) ample line bundles are designed to tackle this question.|$|E

40|$|In an {{unpublished}} preprint, A. King conjectured {{that there}} are tilting bundles over projective varieties which are obtained as invariant quotients of <b>affine</b> <b>spaces</b> for linear actions of reductive groups. The goal {{of this paper is}} to give further examples of strong exceptional sequences of vector bundles on certain projective varieties. These are obtained as geometric invariant quotients of <b>affine</b> <b>spaces</b> by linear actions of reductive groups, as in King's conjecture...|$|R

25|$|In mathematics, the {{convex hull}} or convex {{envelope}} {{of a set}} X of points in the Euclidean plane or in a Euclidean space (or, more generally, in an <b>affine</b> <b>space</b> over the reals) is the smallest convex set that contains X. For instance, when X is a bounded subset of the plane, the convex hull may be visualized as the shape enclosed by a rubber band stretched around X.|$|E
25|$|An {{algebraic}} {{curve is}} an algebraic variety of dimension one. This implies that an affine curve in an <b>affine</b> <b>space</b> of dimension n is defined by, at least, n−1 polynomials in n variables. To define a curve, these polynomials must generate a prime ideal of Krull dimension 1. This condition {{is not easy}} to test in practice. Therefore, the following way to represent non-plane curves may be preferred.|$|E
25|$|A {{geometric}} reformulation is as follows. Let X be a connected affine {{scheme of}} finite type over a field K (for example, an affine variety). Let n be {{the dimension of}} X. By Noether normalization, there is a finite morphism f from X to <b>affine</b> <b>space</b> A'n over K. Then X is Cohen–Macaulay if and only all fibers of f have the same degree. It is striking that this property is independent of the choice of f.|$|E

25|$|If V is an affine variety, its {{coordinate}} ring is {{an integral}} domain and has thus a field of fractions which is denoted k(V) and called the field of the rational functions on V or, shortly, the function field of V. Its elements are the restrictions to V of the rational functions over the <b>affine</b> <b>space</b> containing V. The domain of a rational function f is not V but the complement of the subvariety (a hypersurface) where the denominator of f vanishes.|$|E
25|$|A Euclidean {{space is}} not {{technically}} a vector space {{but rather an}} <b>affine</b> <b>space,</b> on which a vector space acts by translations, or, conversely, a Euclidean vector is the difference (displacement) in an ordered pair of points, not a single point. Intuitively, the distinction says merely {{that there is no}} canonical choice of where the origin should go in the space, because it can be translated anywhere. When a certain point is chosen, it can be declared the origin and subsequent calculations may ignore the difference between a point and its coordinate vector, as said above. See point–vector distinction for details.|$|E
25|$|The points just raised are {{easiest to}} explain in reverse, {{starting}} from the motivation provided by surface theory. In this situation, although the planes being rolled over the surface are tangent planes in a naive sense, {{the notion of a}} tangent space is really an infinitesimal notion, whereas the planes, as affine subspaces of , are infinite in extent. However these affine planes all have a marked point, the point of contact with the surface, and they are tangent to the surface at this point. The confusion therefore arises because an <b>affine</b> <b>space</b> with a marked point can be identified with its tangent space at that point. However, the parallel transport defined by rolling does not fix this origin: it is affine rather than linear; the linear parallel transport can be recovered by applying a translation.|$|E
40|$|This paper dualizes {{the setting}} of <b>affine</b> <b>spaces</b> as {{originally}} introduced by Diers for application to algebraic geometry and expanded upon by various authors, {{to show that the}} fundamental groups of pointed topological spaces appear as the structures of dually <b>affine</b> <b>spaces.</b> The dual of the Zariski closure operator is introduced, and the 1 -sphere and its copowers together with their fundamental groups are shown to be examples of complete objects with respect to the Zariski dual closure operator...|$|R
