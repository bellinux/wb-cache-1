Biomaterials being investigated include natural substances such as collagen or agarose and synthetic ones like polymers and nitrocellulose. They fall into two categories: hydrogels and nanofibers. These materials {{can also be used}} as a vehicle for delivering gene therapy to tissues.|$|E

5|$|After the hurricane, {{the labor}} force diminished and wages {{decreased}} by staggering amounts. In July 2005, 9,592 people applied for unemployment services and the payroll of metropolitan firms declined by 13.6% between July 2005 and July 2007, indicating an estimated loss of 70,000 jobs. The sectors most affected were service-related industries, fluctuating with the population. The only sector to truly thrive after landfall was construction, which was in high demand to make needed repairs <b>and</b> <b>rebuild</b> destroyed homes.|$|E

5|$|Bede relates {{that after}} the mission's arrival in Kent and {{conversion}} of the king, {{they were allowed to}} restore <b>and</b> <b>rebuild</b> old Roman churches for their use. One such was Christ Church, Canterbury, which became Augustine's cathedral church. Archaeological evidence for other Roman churches having been rebuilt is slight, but the church of St Pancras in Canterbury has a Roman building at its core, although it is unclear whether that older building was a church during the Roman era. Another possible site is Lullingstone, in Kent, where a religious site dating to 300 was found underneath an abandoned church.|$|E
5|$|Charles II criticised Bruce's initial {{plans for}} the {{internal}} layout, and an improved scheme was eventually approved. Construction began in July 1671, and by 1674 {{much of the work}} was complete. Bruce built a second gothic tower to mirror the existing one built by James V between 1528 and 1532, and created the courtyard block in a restrained classical style. A second phase of work started in 1676, when the Duke of Lauderdale ordered Bruce to demolish <b>and</b> <b>rebuild</b> the main west façade, resulting by 1679 in the screen wall, topped by a carved imperial crown, which forms the main entrance.|$|E

5|$|In August 1990, WMATA {{hired the}} Perini Corp. {{as the new}} contractor, and {{required}} the company {{to finish the job}} <b>and</b> <b>rebuild</b> the streets in the area, setting a new Green Line dedication of December 1991. Federal monitors overseeing WMATA's spending, however, issued a report in August 1990 accusing WMATA of poor financial oversight of the project and blamed the transit agency for the delays and problems Mergentime/Perini confronted. Mergentime/Perini sued WMATA, claiming that it was improperly dismissed from the project.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013 the Sevenstone project, which {{aimed to}} {{demolish}} <b>and</b> <b>rebuild</b> {{a large part}} of the city centre, and had been on hold since 2009, was further delayed and the company developing it was dropped. The city council is looking for partners to take a new version of the plan forwards. In April 2014 the council, together with Sheffield University, proposed a plan to reduce the blight of empty shops in the city centre by offering them free of charge to small businesses on a month-by-month basis.|$|E

The famous exterior of the structure was buttressed and retained while the extensive renovations proceeded inside. The work lasted from December 1949 until March 1952.|$|E

5|$|When {{the head}} of the British forces in the Peninsula, Sir John Moore, was killed in the Battle of Corunna in January 1809, the British Army having been driven from the Peninsula in disarray, Wellesley sent the Secretary of War a memo insisting that a British force of no less than 30,000 British troops should be sent to defend <b>and</b> <b>rebuild</b> Portugal's {{military}} strength. His proposal was approved and he re-embarked to Lisbon on 14 April 1809, having been appointed to head of all British forces in Portugal on the 6 April– a motion supported by the government and King George III, as Wellesley did not hold seniority.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{new game}} is set within a {{well-established}} franchise, Starbreeze tried {{to retain the}} essence of the world <b>and</b> <b>rebuild</b> these elements. The game's story was written by British science-fiction writer Richard K Morgan, whom the team approached after they read his book Altered Carbon. Syndicate was Morgan's second video-game script after 2011's Crysis 2; he used the original game for reference and included elements that those who had played it would immediately recognize. He preserved the original's dystopian setting and theme, and hoped to use these elements to build a powerful story. Morgan traveled to Sweden to meet Starbreeze's game designers to ensure the game's story would not contradict its overall design.|$|E
5|$|Days {{after the}} storm, fears of food {{shortages}} began to arise as railways, in which food {{would normally be}} able to be delivered, were washed out. To deal with the large number of bodies {{in the wake of the}} disaster, Mexican officials decided to cremate and mass bury victims. By mid-September, between 1,600 and 1,800 people were hired to repair <b>and</b> <b>rebuild</b> the devastated railways in Nuevo León. In 2009, the third edition of the book El Río Fiera Bramaba: 1909 by Oswaldo Sánchez, re-accounting reports form people who experienced the flood, was planned. According to the director of publications at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, the book was considered one of historical quality. In memory of those who perished during the flood, the book was released to the public on August27, 2009, the 100year anniversary of the disaster.|$|E

5|$|Desiring to {{care for}} his sick wife <b>and</b> <b>rebuild</b> his {{personal}} wealth, Breckinridge returned to his law practice in Lexington. In addition to his legal practice, he engaged in land speculation in Minnesota and Wisconsin territories. When Governor Willis A. Gorman of the Minnesota Territory thwarted an attempt by Breckinridge's fellow investors (not including Breckinridge) to secure approval of a railroad connecting Dubuque, Iowa, with their investments near Superior, Wisconsin, they petitioned Pierce to remove Gorman and appoint Breckinridge in his place. In 1855, Pierce authorized two successive investigations of Gorman, but failed to uncover any wrongdoing that would justify his removal. During his time away from politics, Breckinridge also promoted the advancement of horse racing in his native state and was chosen president of the Kentucky Association for the Improvement of the Breed of Horses.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{attempts}} to draw investment {{to the city}} after the hurricane, Galveston never returned to its levels of national importance or prosperity. Development was also hindered by {{the construction of the}} Houston Ship Channel, which brought the Port of Houston into competition with the natural harbor of the Port of Galveston for sea traffic. To further her recovery, <b>and</b> <b>rebuild</b> her population, Galveston actively solicited immigration. Through the efforts of Rabbi Henry Cohen and Congregation B'nai Israel, Galveston became the focus of an immigration plan called the Galveston Movement that, between 1907 and 1914, diverted roughly 10,000 Eastern European Jewish immigrants from the usual destinations of the crowded cities of the Northeastern United States. Additionally numerous other immigrant groups, including Greeks, Italians and Russian Jews, came to the city during this period. This immigration trend substantially altered the ethnic makeup of the island, as well as many other areas of Texas and the western U.S.|$|E
5|$|Following the 39th Battalion's {{return to}} Australia, {{the men were}} given a period of leave before 30th Brigade was reconstituted on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. Initially, {{the plan was to}} reorganise the brigade <b>and</b> <b>rebuild</b> it prior to {{returning}} it to New Guinea, but in July it was decided that the 30th Brigade, along with its component battalions—the 39th, 49th, and 3rd Battalions—would be disbanded and used to reinforce the 6th Division, with reinforcements being sent to the 16th and 19th Brigades. This came into effect on 3 July 1943 {{and as a result of}} this decision, the Militiamen that had been called up for service were transferred to the 36th Battalion, a Militia battalion from New South Wales, while those who had volunteered for overseas service were sent to the 2/2nd Battalion; both of these units later saw further service in New Guinea.|$|E
