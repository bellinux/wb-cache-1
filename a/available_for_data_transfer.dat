40|$|The {{development}} of a standard for interactive multimedia services over Community Antenna Television (CATV) networks is drawing interest from the data communications, telecommunications, broadcasting and the entertainment industries. Until recently, the solutions <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> over Hybrid Fibre Coax (HFC) CATV networks were based on proprietary random access protocols and consequently they cannot be used in an open system and are limited when delivering digital audio and video streams.

In Europe the Digital Video broadcasting (DVB) Cable Modem specification has been adopted.

40|$|The {{last few}} years have seen network data rates skyrocket from a few Mbps to a Gbps or more. However, a lack of {{integration}} of the host-network interface, the operating system, and network protocols has resulted in end-applications seeing {{only a small fraction}} of this total bandwidth being <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>data</b> <b>transfer.</b> The emergence of demanding applications in the realms of multimedia and virtual reality provides further impetus in the drive to overcome this problem.

A prototype of the interface is being built at Washington University as part of an ARPA-sponsored gigabit local ATM testbed.

40|$|Abstract — Classical ad-hoc network {{algorithms}} become impractical for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks when {{density of}} vehicles {{is low in}} rural areas and during the periods when the vehicle traffic is low in cities (such as at night). End-to-end connectivity requirement of these algorithms causes deflection. Connections get broken when a suitable network element isn’t <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>data</b> <b>transfer.</b> This problem which occurs in low dense partially connected Vehicular Ad hoc Networks can be solved by using delay tolerant approaches in routing algorithms. By using the store-carry-forward method, data is carried by network elements until a suitable network element is found. By this way, network connectivity is provided in a delayed manner between momentarily disconnected vehicles. In this paper, the impact of delayed transfer of data to an end-to-end transfer {{and the impact of}} data lifetime to the network performance are examined. Considering the speed of vehicles and the desired throughput, lifetime of data is determined according to the network connectivity. The results of this study contribute to the fulfilment of the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements in Vehicular Ad Hoc Network applications. I...|$|E
40|$|A FIFO is a First In First Out data queue {{for sharing}} data between {{multiple}} tasks or threads. Fifos {{are one of}} the most basic communication mechanisms used in real-time operating systems. Especially for two real-time tasks or between a real-time task and non-real-time process, it is effective because it allows non-blocking as well as blocking semantics, which is mandatory to avert priority inversion between different domains. In the current XtratuM[7] version, there is no method <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> between domains which run under XtratuMs control. So we created the XM-FIFO for the XtratuM which can be used to transfer data between real-time threads or between real-time threads and Linux user-level processes. The XM-FIFO consists of a share FIFO module, Linux FIFO device and PaRTiKle FIFO device. So far, we have released XM-FIFO V 1. 0, XM-FIFO V 2. 0 and XM-FIFO V 3. 0 continuously working on improvements especially at the conceptual level. Three versions adopt different technologies and provide different functions. XM-FIFO V 1. 0 offers the special system calls to transfer data between domains and XtratuM kernel. And the FIFOs internal synchronization is achieved by disabling interrupts- simple but undesirable in an RTOS. XM-FIFO V 2. 0 adopts lock-free mechanism to access the FIFO synchronously and data is copied. In the XM-FIFO V 3. 0, the FIFO data memory and control memory are mapped into the domain kernel space, which can increase data access speed as there is no longer an internal data copy. In the paper, besides XM-FIFOs design, the implementation of the memory mapping and lock-free mechanism in the XM-FIFO are described and comparative benchmarks interpreted. ...|$|E
40|$|A mobile ad-hoc {{network is}} an {{autonomous}} system of mobile nodes establishing a {{network in the}} absence of any fixed infrastructure. Mobile ad-hoc network due to potentially high mobility have provided new challenges by introducing special consideration differentiating from the unique characteristics of the wireless medium and the dynamic nature of the network topology. Due to unique network formation, routing in mobile ad-hoc network is a challenging issue. Effort has been undergoing to transform TCP so that it could support routing function in an ad-hoc network. This research has discovered that most of the TCP based variant routing solutions of mobile ad-hoc network has not been successful in addressing problem at full. Taking TCP based routing solution as a main problem, this research has proposed a novel routing solution called Node feedback TCP based mechanism as a routing scheme for mobile ad-hoc network. Node feedback TCP based mechanism introduces a new flavor of TCP for mobile ad-hoc network. It follows an intermediate approach in between some of the existing mechanisms of TCP based schemes for mobile ad-hoc network. We have addressed TCP slow start mechanism in the context of mobile ad-hoc network and introduce measures through whom TCP can differentiate between real congestion and congestion assumed by TCP due to packet lost or route failure in mobile ad-hoc network. In addition our proposed mechanisms also deal with out-of-order delivery problem of TCP in mobile ad-hoc network. It is important to mention that NFBTCP not only address TCP related issues but also provides a number of different operations to assists in the smooth running of an ad-hoc network. The scheme has been developed in Java and Evaluated in SWANS. In the light of the simulation experiments, it could be seen that NFBTCP performed well in all simulation environment. It can be confirmed that NFBTCP has proven itself as a fully functional and operationalable for mobile ad-hoc network, thus should be seen or taken as a new novel TCP based solution for mobile ad-hoc network. A higher number of route requests and route replies representing networking activities were observed with the increase of mobile nodes. In addition to the messages activities, good numbers of routes were added at the end of each simulation cycle. It is quite understandable that the more routes <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> in mobile ad-hoc network, the better. Moreover, such additions to the available routes could directly impact overall throughout. Lastly, nodes in mobile ad-hoc network suffer with limited resources. That makes conservation of all such resources an important issue in the context of mobile ad-hoc network. The results of simulation experiments validate the main concepts of the scheme especially congestion avoidance and out-of-order packet delivery. The scheme generates a higher number of routes suggesting that the implemented congestion avoidance and out-of-order packet delivery mechanisms of NFBTCP are successful in reducing the impact of link breakage since subsequently it was not possible for more routes to be added. The addition of more routes demonstrates that more packets are broadcast and suggests smooth flow of data and control packets. We believe NFBTCP offers a complete and an effective TCP based routing solution for mobile ad-hoc network...|$|E

Parallely, in the wireless networking world, the trend has shifted to multi-radio (as opposed to multi-channel) enabled communications. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive computation offloading solution that uses the multiple radio links <b>available</b> <b>for</b> associated <b>data</b> <b>transfer,</b> optimally.

Due to this, image compression is required [1, 2]. Lossless coding usually does not produce sufficient compression ratios for many practical applications. Although for certain applications, such as medical imaging and hyperspectral remote sensing, many experts consider lossy compression impossible or not recommended [3, 4], nevertheless they are still used also for these applications (see, for example, [3, 5 – 7] to mention a few). In {{the rest of this}} paper by image compression we will mean a lossy compression if not otherwise specified.|$|R
40|$|Mobile ad-hoc {{networks}} (MANET) rely on wireless {{connections between}} mobile nodes, which mean limited bandwidth & {{high rate of}} disconnections between nodes. So {{there is a great}} need for a new routing protocol that have low routing message overhead to enhance the performance of MANET. The reduction of routing message overhead will decrease the wasted portions of bandwidth that used for exchange routing messages between nodes, and increase the bandwidth <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>transferring</b> <b>data,</b> which in turn increases the network throughput and decreases the latency. This paper proposes a new MANET routing protocol that decreases both of the routing message overhead and the average end to end delay by on average 27. 9 %, 13. 7 % respectively less than the well known AODV routing protocol. This led to increase the throughput by 23. 87 % more than AODV routing protocol...|$|R

30|$|Multi-path routing, a routing {{technique}} that enables data transmission over multiple paths, {{is an effective}} strategy in achieving reliability in wireless sensor networks. However, multi-path routing does not guarantee deterministic transmission. This is because more than one path is <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>transferring</b> <b>data</b> from the source node to the destination node. A hybrid multi-path routing algorithm is proposed for industrial wireless mesh networks for improving reliability and determinacy of data transmission, {{as well as to}} effectively deal with link failures. The proposed algorithm adopts the enhanced Dijkstra’s algorithm for searching the shortest route from the gateway to each end node for first route setup. A virtual pheromone distinct from the regular pheromone is introduced to realize pheromone diffusion and updating. In this way, multiple routes are searched based on the ant colony optimization algorithm. The routes used <b>for</b> <b>data</b> transmission are selected based on their regular pheromone values, facilitating the delivery of data through better routes. Link failures are then handled using route maintenance mechanism. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional algorithms in terms of average end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, and routing overhead; moreover, it has a strong capacity to cope with topological changes, thereby making it more suitable for industrial wireless mesh networks.|$|R
40|$|A Mobile Adhoc Network is a {{group of}} {{wireless}} mobile computers in which nodes cooperate by forwarding packets for each other to allow them to communicate beyond direct wireless transmission range. Due to wide-ranging characteristics of the Ad Hoc Networks like decentralization, dynamic topology and neighbor based routing, it is always at a risk to internal as well as external attacks. In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) where security is a crucial issue, trust plays an important factor that could improve the number of successful data transmission process. Many solutions have been proposed by the reaearchers and currently being improved in this area. Most of them are designed to operate in specific particular situations, which may fail to work successfully in other scenarios. The aim of this present work is to emphasize on the use of trust concept to enhance the security by calculating proportion based trust in a global manner. The present work offers an alternate to improve the trustworthiness of the neighbourhood and secure the routing procedure. It helps in computing the trust in neighbours and selecting the most secure route from the <b>available</b> ones <b>for</b> the <b>data</b> <b>transfer.</b> In the proposed model, trust is not calculated for any particular situation instead, it is computed based on a summary of behaviour of the node for a specific amount of period...|$|R

It has four components: a performance predictor that uses features gathered by a network monitor, and a traffic profiler to estimate transfer sizes near {{the start of a}} transfer, all fed into a network selector that uses the prediction and transfer size estimate to optimize an objective. For each transfer, Delphi either recommends the best single network to use, or recommends Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP), but crucially selects the network for MPTCP s primary subflow. The choice of primary subflow has a strong impact onthe transfer completion time, especially for short transfers. We designed and implemented Delphi in Linux. It requires no application modifications. Our evaluation shows that Delphi reduces application network transfer time by 46 % for Web browsing and by 49 % for video streaming, comparedwith Android s default policy of always using Wi-Fi when it is available. Delphi can also be configured to achieve high throughput while being battery-efficient: in this configuration, it achieves 1. 9 x the throughput of Android s default policy while only consuming 6 % more energy...|$|R

The Navier-Stokes and energy equations for an incompressible Newtonian fluid are solved in a body fitted coordinate system using a control-volume method. In the present work, the nanofluid {{is a mixture of}} water and alumina particles, and its thermophysical properties are considered as a function of temperature as well as particle concentration.

Present results indicate that both the nanoparticle and curvature effects enhance the heat transfer performance but at the expense of increased pressure drop. However, in the present case, the nanoparticle contribution to the pressure drop is dominant, which increases by up to two orders of magnitude at higher nanoparticle concentrations. The ratio of the nanofluid Prandtl number to the based fluid Prandtl number is established as a criterion for the choice of a nanofluid. This ratio must be less than 1 to achieve higher heat transfer rates with relatively low pressure drops as the particle concentration is increased...|$|R

Two computers connected by the Internet could temporarily become unable to communicate for various reasons, from a failure at either end, to overloading of an intermediate node connecting the two, to an out-of-date routing table. The bandwidth of the Internet is relatively low: its <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> speed is inadequate for applications {{that need to}} access very large data objects. Since its introduction the Internet kept a much faster rate of increase <b>for</b> the <b>data</b> <b>available</b> than <b>for</b> the <b>data</b> <b>transfer</b> speed.

This thesis presents techniques to deal with availability and consistency in partitionable {{low bandwidth}} networks, and it presents a service suitable for use in such networks. The first part of the thesis presents replication techniques suitable in a partitionable network. A partitionable network puts goals of availability and consistency at odds. Making objects available in a partitionable network requires replication; yet modifications of replicated objects during a partition can introduce inconsistencies. We show various replication techniques that provide continuous availability while managing inconsistencies among replicas. The second part of the thesis describes the PEX system, an example of a service that instantiates these abstractions. PEX is an execution service that facilitates processing of remote data. It allows computations to be performed near data, so that data need not be copied over the network. It provides a session interface which facilitates the management of related computations operating on scattered data. Internally, PEX replicates various information, including sessions, using some of the techniques introduced in the first section of the thesis. This permits the system to keep computations running in the face of partitions. The third part of the thesis gives two example applications that use PEX (a distributed shell and a parallel make) and reports the performance of the PEX system...|$|R
