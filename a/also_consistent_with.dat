5|$|In Bishop, {{intensity}} VI effects included {{broken windows}} and cracked walls in commercial and government buildings. Items fell from store shelves at grocery markets, streets were cracked, and wells had {{changes in the}} flow of water. The damage to the mobile homes in Chalfant was <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> intensity VI shaking, with some of the homes moving laterally as much as 18 inches. Also in this classification was damage to pipe supports along a portion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct between the Upper, Middle, and Control Gorge Power Plants southeast of Crowley Lake. Intensity V (Moderate) effects (including cracked windows and broken underground pipes) were present in the Central Valley, Death Valley, and Carson City, Nevada.|$|E
5|$|Most {{observed}} events (70%) have a {{duration of}} greater than two seconds and {{are classified as}} long gamma-ray bursts. Because these events constitute {{the majority of the}} population and because they tend to have the brightest afterglows, they have been observed in much greater detail than their short counterparts. Almost every well-studied long gamma-ray burst has been linked to a galaxy with rapid star formation, and in many cases to a core-collapse supernova as well, unambiguously associating long GRBs with the deaths of massive stars. Long GRB afterglow observations, at high redshift, are <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the GRB having originated in star-forming regions.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble {{assumption is}} <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the accidental production of arterial bubbles. One scenario considers a shunt {{at the heart}} or lung level that passes bubbles from the venous to the arterial side. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is thought to only open in certain conditions. A PFO conveniently explains neurological accidents after recreational air diving without any procedure violation, {{but it does not}} explain vestibular hits in deep diving. Vestibular symptoms can appear very early in the decompression, long before the massive bubble production required to overload the system.|$|E

5|$|University {{president}} Robert Bruininks {{originally planned}} to have the school apply for a state liquor license in order to serve beer and wine in limited areas of the stadium. Under his proposal, alcohol would have been available only to occupants of premium season ticket seats ranging in price from $1,800 to $45,000 a year. This is/was consistent with the University's long-held alcohol policy at other on-campus athletic venues, such as Williams Arena and Mariucci Arena. This is <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> other NCAA institutions (including all other Big Ten Conference teams except for the University of Michigan) with on campus stadiums. No Big Ten stadiums serve alcohol in their general seating.|$|E
5|$|An empty matrix is {{a matrix}} {{in which the}} number of rows or columns (or both) is zero. Empty {{matrices}} help dealing with maps involving the zero vector space. For example, if A is a 3-by-0 matrix and B is a 0-by-3 matrix, then AB is the 3-by-3 zero matrix corresponding to the null map from a 3-dimensional space V to itself, while BA is a 0-by-0 matrix. There is no common notation for empty matrices, but most computer algebra systems allow creating and computing with them. The determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix is 1 as follows from regarding the empty product occurring in the Leibniz formula for the determinant as 1. This value is <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> {{the fact that the}} identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant1, a fact that is often used {{as a part of the}} characterization of determinants.|$|E

30|$|In sum, the {{descriptive}} evidence of managers’ DVA disclosures is not <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> managers providing DVA disclosures very continuously {{but it is}} <b>also</b> not <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> DVA disclosures by managers being very scarce. Rather, managers’ DVA reporting in quarterly earnings press releases varies which further motivates the following analysis on its determinants.|$|R

25|$|The {{orientation}} of the rings is consistent with an edge-on view from Earth in 2008, explaining the observed dimming of Chariklo between 1997 and 2008 {{by a factor of}} 1.75, as well as the gradual disappearance of water ice and other materials from its spectrum as the observed surface area of the rings decreased. <b>Also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> this edge-on orientation is that since 2008, the Chariklo system has increased in brightness by a factor of 1.5 again, and the infrared water-ice spectral features have reappeared. This suggests that the rings are composed at least partially of water ice. An icy ring composition is <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the expected density of a disrupted body within Chariklo's Roche limit.|$|E
25|$|This {{theory is}} <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> growing {{evidence}} that the human brain changes structurally due to environmental demands. For instance, it has been established that structure is altered {{as a consequence of}} learning in domains independent of language.|$|E

50|$|A crucial {{experiment}} is an experiment that {{is intended to}} test several hypotheses at the same time. Ideally, one hypothesis may be confirmed {{and all the others}} rejected.

25|$|Thus {{it helps}} to {{distinguish}} words like Buße (long vowel) 'penance, fine' and Busse (short vowel) 'buses'. It is <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the general rule of German spelling that a doubled consonant letter serves to mark the preceding vowel as short (the consonant sound is never actually doubled or lengthened in pronunciation).|$|E
25|$|Similarly the Sagnac effect, {{observed}} by G. Sagnac in 1913, was immediately {{seen to be}} fully consistent with special relativity. In fact, the Michelson-Gale-Pearson experiment in 1925 was proposed specifically as a test to confirm the relativity theory, although it was also recognized that such tests, which merely measure absolute rotation, are <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> non-relativistic theories.|$|E
25|$|In Singapore, where {{conviction}} {{rates for}} criminal offences are high, an acquittal {{is akin to}} the judiciary rejecting the executive's stand regarding a party’s guilt. Although {{it has been suggested}} that the low acquittal rate is evidence of a lack of judicial independence, it is <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> a stringent prosecution process that takes action only against persons who are manifestly guilty, such that even the most fair and independent-minded judge would decide to convict.|$|E

25|$|The {{forecasts}} for the Senate {{proved to}} be correct for every race. But the near stalemate in Minnesota led to a recount that was settled only on June 30, 2009. In Alaska, after a protracted counting of ballots, on November 19 Republican incumbent Ted Stevens conceded the seat to Democrat Mark Begich, an outcome that Silver had forecast on election day. And in Georgia, a run-off election on December 2 led to the re-election of Republican Saxby Chambliss, a result that was <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> Silver's original projection.|$|E
25|$|Haplotype V(p49/TaqI), a {{characteristic}} Moroccan haplotype, may be {{also found in}} the Iberian peninsula, and a decreasing North-South cline of frequency clearly establishes a gene flow from Morocco towards Iberia which is <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> Moorish presence in the peninsula. This North-South cline of frequency of halpotype V is to be observed throughout the Mediterranean region, ranging from frequencies of close to 30% in southern Portugal to around 10% in southern France. Similarly, the highest frequency in Italy {{is to be found in}} the southern island of Sicily (28%).|$|E

25|$|This {{does not}} mean, however, that all {{remaining}} differences between models and observations have been resolved. The observed changes in some climate variables, such as Arctic sea ice, {{some aspects of}} precipitation, and patterns of surface pressure, appear to be proceeding much more rapidly than models have projected. The reasons for these differences are not well understood. Nevertheless, the bottom-line conclusion from climate fingerprinting {{is that most of}} the observed changes studied to date are consistent with each other, and are <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> our scientific understanding of how the climate system would be expected to respond to the increase in heat-trapping gases resulting from human activities.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> ZF + DC {{that every}} set of reals is Lebesgue measurable; however, this {{consistency}} result, due to Robert M. Solovay, cannot be proved in ZFC itself, but requires a mild large cardinal assumption (the {{existence of an}} inaccessible cardinal). The much stronger axiom of determinacy, or AD, implies that every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, has the property of Baire, and has the perfect set property (all three of these results are refuted by AC itself). ZF + DC + AD is consistent provided that a sufficiently strong large cardinal axiom is consistent (the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals).|$|E
25|$|Alternations in Italian {{heteroclitic}} nouns such as l'uovo fresco ("the fresh egg") / le uova fresche ("the fresh eggs") {{are usually}} analysed as masculine in the singular and feminine in the plural, with an irregular plural in -a. However, it is <b>also</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> their historical development {{to say that}} uovo is simply a regular neuter noun (ovum, plural ova) and that the characteristic ending for words agreeing with these nouns is -o in the singular and -a in the plural. The same alternation in gender exists in certain Romanian nouns, but is considered regular as it is more common than in Italian. Thus, a relict neuter gender can arguably be said to persist in Italian and Romanian.|$|E
30|$|At working level, {{there is}} an urgent need to rediscover goods to develop, common spaces and {{community}} ties.
