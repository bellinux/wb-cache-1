These arrangements have now been largely withdrawn under pressure from other major trading powers, principally the United States. The withdrawal of these indirect subsidies to Caribbean producers is expected to favour the more efficient banana producers of Central America, in which American companies have an economic interest. In addition, small-scale Caribbean producers are finding it difficult to comply with increasingly strict certification requirements.

5000|$|In {{the run-up}} to the decisive {{referendum}} there had been demands to vote separately on the construction of the underground and suburban train systems. In fact, the suburban train was widely undisputed while a heated sociopolitical debate concerning the Underground broke out. In particular, members of the Social Democratic Party were against the [...] "project of megalomania" [...] (as they called it). They feared that the construction of the underground railway would lead to rising land prices, higher rents, and housing close to the city centre would be in danger of being converted into offices. This would lead to a displacement of the city's population to the suburbs, resulting in longer journeys to work. Moreover, opponents considered the costs for the underground [...] "astronomically high". Supporters argued that the underground was a project of environment protection and asserted that many <b>accompanying</b> <b>measures</b> had been prepared in order to maintain and promote housing in the city. Their argument that without an underground there would be a [...] "total gridlock" [...] was deemed irrelevant, because the economy had started to slow down and the city's population decreased slightly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Substation {{grounding}} systems {{need to be}} inspected {{periodically to}} test and verify their original protective functionality and characteristics. The most important parameters are the values of touch and step voltages under fault conditions as they directly affect the on-site personnel safety. Grounding system verification is a multi-stage process, which has to be planned in details prior to actual measurements. That implies a need for an elaborated measuring methodology {{as well as for}} custom designed measuring system. Prototype of such a system has been developed and tested in the field. This paper focuses on the description of program support as a framework and foundation of a complex measuring system. Application structure, which is tightly bound to measuring methodology concepts, is presented through the typical example of system usage. Additional issues and references to <b>accompanying</b> <b>measuring</b> instrumentation are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Odra {{river is}} {{extremely}} polluted by organic matter, nitrates, ammonia, phosphorus, bacteria, particles, heavy metals and other micro pollutants from municipalities, industries and agriculture. The poor water quality severely affects the ecology and represents {{a risk to}} human health. The water has a very limited value of use. This report presents an abatement programme with both technical and <b>accompanying</b> <b>measures.</b> In order to identify the major polluters several multi criteria analysis have been developed, discussed and evaluated. Technical measures for 23 "Hot spots" are proposed and ranked according to the cost/benefit ratio. Measures for agriculture {{have been based on}} previous work. The proposed abatement programme gives a significant reduction of the total pollution discharges in the region, and improves both local and regional water quality. The abatement programme will also contribute to the Czech Government's obligations to reduce the pollution to the Baltic Sea. <b>Accompanying</b> <b>measures</b> (policy, administrative including legal and economic measures) have been addressed in detail.

40|$|This <b>accompanying</b> <b>measure</b> {{reviewed}} {{existing and}} collected new evidence of crossborder commuting in six border {{regions in the}} EU. The study investigated reasons for immobility {{and the perception of}} factors which inhibit potential commuting to work across borders. It produced six detailed border reports discussing labour market characteristics and policies, evidence of the level and type of cross-border commuting and of factors inhibiting cross-border commuting. Subsequently, 102 interviews were conducted on four border regions (Germany/Netherlands, Sweden/Denmark, Finland/Sweden and Italy/France). The results in brief: High levels of indifference (interviewees not even considering the option of cross-border commuting) were found in France, the Netherlands and also Denmark, in contrast to the Italian and German samples, as well as either side of the Finnish-Swedish border. Some borders hence demonstrated a remarkable cross-border imbalance, as far as levels of indifference are concerned. The relatively better domestic labour market seems to be a relevant (stay) factor...|$|R

40|$|The project publicVoiceXML is a {{trial as}} part of an <b>accompanying</b> <b>measure</b> {{specific}} to Open Source software actions, managed by unit INFSO/E 2 of the European Commission. The initial overall project goals were twofold: first we provided a sustainable reference installation at a radio station, based on the needs of their day-to-day work and secondly we published an open source release of VoiceXML as a reference implementation. The renege of the contractual responsilibilities of Amarc lead the project in a phase of innactivity regarding dissemination. The time to solve this problem as well as the rearrangement of tasks and responsibilities within the consortium effect on a delayed dissemination track. Due to the discontinuation of Amarc as a strong partner in addressing european wide radio stations as well as the reviewers suggested widening of the scope of the project, the first goal of providing radio stations with publicVoiceXML was adapted.
