5000|$|Hewlett {{attended}} undergraduate classes {{taught by}} Fred Terman at Stanford and became acquainted with David Packard. Packard {{and he began}} discussing forming a company in August 1937, and founded Hewlett-Packard Company as a partnership on January 1, 1939. A flip of a coin decided the ordering of their names.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of rich audio spectra requires usually complex source waveforms, {{a large number}} of simple source components, or increased algorithmic complexity.

5000|$|A {{phase-shift}} oscillator is {{a linear}} electronic oscillator circuit {{that produces a}} sine wave output. It consists of an inverting amplifier element such as a transistor or op amp with its output fed back to its input through a phase-shift network consisting of resistors and capacitors in a ladder network. The feedback network 'shifts' the phase of the amplifier output by 180 degrees at the oscillation frequency to give positive feedback. [...] Phase-shift oscillators are often used at audio frequency as <b>audio</b> <b>oscillators.</b>|$|R
50|$|On other {{keyboard}} instruments, a key {{may be a}} lever which mechanically {{triggers a}} hammer to strike a group of strings, as on a piano, or an electric switch which energizes an <b>audio</b> <b>oscillator</b> as on an electronic organ or a synthesizer.|$|E
50|$|Audio-frequency signal {{generators}} generate signals in the audio-frequency range and above. An early example was the HP200A <b>Audio</b> <b>Oscillator,</b> the first product {{sold by the}} Hewlett-Packard Company in 1939. Applications include checking frequency response of audio equipment, and many uses in the electronic laboratory.|$|E
50|$|The {{contacts}} {{could operate}} an <b>audio</b> <b>oscillator</b> {{for the study}} of International Morse Code (used by radio), or a sounder {{for the study of}} American Morse Code (used by railroads), or a light bulb (Aldis Lamp - used by Navy ship to ship or by Heliograph).|$|E
50|$|After {{years of}} work Black invented the {{negative}} feedback amplifier which uses negative feedback to reduce the gain of a high-gain, non-linear amplifier and makes it act as a low-gain, linear amplifier with much lower noise and distortion. The Negative feedback amplifier allowed Bell system to reduce overcrowding of lines and extend its long-distance network by means of carrier telephony. It enabled the design of accurate fire-control systems in World War II, and it {{formed the basis of}} early operational amplifiers, as well as precise, variable-frequency <b>audio</b> <b>oscillators.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A low-frequency {{oscillator}} (LFO) is an electronic oscillator that generates a frequency below ≈20Hz. [...] This term is typically {{used in the}} field of audio synthesizers, to distinguish it from an <b>audio</b> frequency <b>oscillator.</b>|$|R

50|$|Hewlett-Packard's first product, {{built in}} the garage, was an <b>audio</b> <b>oscillator,</b> the HP200A. One of Hewlett-Packard's first {{customers}} was Walt Disney Studios, which purchased eight oscillators to test and certify the sound systems in theaters {{that were going to}} run the first major film released in stereophonic sound, Fantasia.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} reliable sources used for audio test was the first product made by Hewlett-Packard in 1939, the HP200A <b>audio</b> <b>oscillator.</b> The clever and inexpensive design of the HP200A allowed testers to generate very high quality, low distortion sine waves {{that could be used}} for testing. This was followed by the company's introduction of the HP320A and HP320B Distortion Analyzers in 1941.|$|E
5000|$|Most famously, Tanner {{played his}} Electro-Theremin on three songs by The Beach Boys: [...] "I Just Wasn't Made for These Times", [...] "Good Vibrations", and [...] "Wild Honey".

50|$|Analogue {{television}} receivers using system M: 41.25 MHz (audio) and 45.75 MHz (video). Note, {{the channel}} is flipped {{over in the}} conversion process in an intercarrier system, so the audio IF frequency {{is lower than the}} video IF frequency. Also, there is no <b>audio</b> local <b>oscillator,</b> the injected video carrier serves that purpose.|$|R
50|$|The {{blue box}} {{consisted}} {{of a set of}} <b>audio</b> <b>oscillators,</b> a telephone keypad, an audio amplifier and speaker. Its use relied, like much of the telephone hacking methodology of the time, on the use of a constant tone of 2600 Hz to indicate an unused telephone line. A free long distance telephone call (such as a 1-800 number or, less commonly, the information operator from another area code) was made using a regular telephone, and when the line was connected, a 2600 Hz tone from the blue box was fed into the mouthpiece of the telephone, causing the operator to be disconnected and a free long distance line to be available to the blue box user. The keyboard was then used to place the desired call, using multi-frequency tones specific for telephone operators. These frequencies are different from the normal touch tone frequencies used by telephone subscribers, which is why the telephone keypad could not be used and the blue box was necessary.|$|R
5000|$|MCW can be {{transmitted}} from any common amateur radio transceiver in AM or FM mode with audio input from an <b>audio</b> tone <b>oscillator</b> or equivalent <b>audio</b> source. [...] MCW is not allowed in the United States on amateur radio frequencies lower than 50.1 MHz, or between 219 and 220 MHz, {{as it is a}} very inefficient use of radio spectrum. When the amateur radio transceiver is in SSB mode, the resulting modulation is J2A or J2B and therefore not MCW by definition.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} common gain-stabilized {{circuits}} is the Wien bridge oscillator. In this circuit, two RC circuits are used, one with the RC components in series and one with the RC components in parallel. The Wien Bridge is often used in audio signal generators because it can be easily tuned using a two-section variable capacitor or a two section variable potentiometer (which is more easily obtained than a variable capacitor suitable for generation at low frequencies). The archetypical HP200A <b>audio</b> <b>oscillator</b> is a Wien Bridge oscillator.|$|E
50|$|Mauch {{worked on}} reading {{machines}} having an “optophone-like” output, a “speech-like” sound output, and a synthetic speech output. The {{only one of}} these that was competitive to the Optacon development was the Stereotoner, basically an improved optophone. The Stereotoner design concept was that the user would move a vertical array of photosensors across a line of text. Each photosensor would send its signal to an <b>audio</b> <b>oscillator</b> set to a different frequency, with the top photosensor driving the highest frequency and the bottom photosensor driving the lowest frequency. The user would then hear tones and chords from which the letters could be identified.|$|E
5000|$|It was a low-distortion <b>audio</b> <b>{{oscillator}}</b> {{used for}} testing sound equipment. It used the Wien bridge oscillator circuit, {{that had been}} the subject of Bill Hewlett's Masters thesis. It was also the first such commercial oscillator to use a simple light bulb as the temperature-dependent resistor in its feedback network. The light bulb was an inexpensive and effective automatic gain control that not only kept the oscillator output amplitude constant, but it also kept the oscillator's loop gain near unity. The latter is a key technique for achieving a low distortion oscillator. Earlier, Meacham had used light bulbs in bridge circuits to stabilize and linearize oscillators in 1938.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, Packard and Hewlett {{established}} Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Packard's garage with {{an initial}} capital investment of $538 (...) [...] Packard mentions in his book The HP Way that the name Hewlett-Packard {{was determined by the}} flip of a coin: HP, rather than PH. Their first product was an <b>audio</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> sold to Walt Disney Studios for use on the soundtrack of Fantasia. The HP Way describes HP's management philosophy, which encourages creativity and shuns traditional business hierarchy and formality. During World War II HP produced radio, sonar, radar, nautical, and aviation devices.|$|R
50|$|By {{varying the}} BFO {{frequency}} around 44000 Hz, the listener can vary the output audio frequency; {{this is useful}} to correct for small differences between the tuning of the transmitter and the receiver, particularly useful when tuning in single sideband (SSB) voice. The waveform produced by the BFO beats against the IF signal in the mixer stage of the receiver. Any drift of the local oscillator or the beat-frequency oscillator will affect the pitch of the received <b>audio,</b> so stable <b>oscillators</b> are used.|$|R
40|$|JACK-ON is a {{wireless}} sensor interface using sine tone oscillators. Sensor resistances alter oscillator frequencies or amplitudes, and the <b>audio</b> output of <b>oscillators</b> is sent through a generic wireless audio transceiver. The wireless audio receiver is {{plugged into the}} computer’s sound card, where oscillator frequencies and amplitudes are analyzed in software. Thus, analog to digital conversion is achieved through the sound card in the computer receiving the audio signal. It is hoped that this method provides a cheap and robust wireless sensor transmission solution. In this paper, we look at some design issues and early results gathered from the JACK-ON system...|$|R
