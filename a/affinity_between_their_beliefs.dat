40|$|In {{this study}} I present {{data from a}} six-month {{qualitative}} study that examined how three English Language Arts teachers' beliefs about teaching, learning, and their students interacted with specific school, curricular, and educational policies to shape their instructional practice. Data drew from extensive interviews, classroom observations, and teaching artifacts. Data analysis focused on alignments and misalignments between teachers' expressed <b>beliefs</b> and <b>their</b> observed teaching practices and on the negotiations that occurred when the teachers were faced with misalignments <b>between</b> <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> and the educational contexts in which they worked. Findings from this research study demonstrate that {{when faced with a}} tension <b>between</b> <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> and school and policy pressures, the three teachers drew upon several different negotiation strategies including isolating themselves from the larger school context or becoming more actively involved in the school context. These negotiation strategies employed were dependent on the level of agency the teacher felt in her particular school context as well as the type of administrative leadership in her school context. However, misalignments between the teachers' beliefs and instructional practices could not be entirely attributed to school or national educational policies, such as No Child Left Behind (NCLB); rather, the teachers' limited critical reflection on their instructional practice and the broad, vague nature of many of the teachers' core beliefs about teaching and learning accounted for many of the misalignments found <b>between</b> <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> and instructional practices. These findings suggest that teachers need strongly-guided opportunities to develop and critically reflect on both <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> and instructional practices and to strategize how to make productive negotiations between these beliefs, practices, and external pressures (such as NCLB) if they are to maintain positive professional relationships and adapt their instructional practices in the face of new policies and "best practices. ...|$|R

For example, a 2011 experiment found that, when the harm that their meat-eating causes animals is explicitly brought to people's attention, they tend to rate those animals as possessing fewer mental capacities compared to when the harm is not brought to their attention. This is especially evident when people expect to eat meat in the near future. Such denial makes it less uncomfortable for people to eat animals. The data suggest that people who consume meat {{go to great lengths to}} try to resolve these moral inconsistencies <b>between</b> <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> and behaviour by adjusting <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> about what animals are capable of feeling.

The attribution of self-perception to animals is based on a distinction between the experiential awareness of the soul and the intellectual understanding of its essence, a distinction postulated by all three authors.

30|$|In general, {{there are}} two main {{approaches}} to modeling the process of opinion formation in social networks. The first approach assumes that individual agents are fully rational and can process all available information in a sophisticated manner to update <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> according to Bayes’ rule [1, 2, 3]. This kind of Bayesian updating makes the problem of drawing inferences about one’s neighbors rather complex and quickly becomes intractable even in simple networks. Furthermore, a series of laboratory experiments conducted by Choi et al. [4, 5] have shown that individuals’ behavioral patterns substantially deviate from strategies that would be followed by fully rational (Bayesian) agents. As a result, a second widely used approach to modeling opinion dynamics has built on DeGroot’s [6] seminal work which relies on the assumption that agents are boundedly rational. According to this formulation, individual nodes use some simple rule-of-thumb to update <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> in each period as a function of <b>their</b> neighbors’ <b>beliefs</b> in the previous period [7, 8, 9]. This paper also lies within the framework of bounded rationality but suggests a novel updating rule which stipulates that the weight placed by an agent on another one’s opinion is a continuously decreasing function of the distance <b>between</b> <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> in the previous period.|$|R

Transformative learning can be the result of different triggers or “disorienting dilemmas, ” such as socio-cultural or environ-mental change or crisis, that stimulate individuals to question <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> and worldviews as they attempt to make meaning of the new situation.

30|$|This paper remains {{within the}} context of global {{interactions}} to introduce a simple and intuitive updating rule according to which the weight placed by an agent on another one’s opinion decreases continuously with the distance <b>between</b> <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> in the previous period. Our main objective is to jointly show convergence and consensus by utilizing the conceptual framework of dynamical systems as well as to study how the consensus belief depends on the initial conditions in this context. For the case of two agents, we analytically find that the limiting belief is the simple arithmetic mean of the initial opinions. When there are three agents in the network, a similar analysis of convergence and consensus is followed by the use of both computational and analytical methods to derive the implicit relationship between the consensus belief and the vector of the initial opinions. Therefore, our analysis implies the existence of an implicit functional relationship between the limiting consensus belief and the set of agents’ initial opinions.|$|R
