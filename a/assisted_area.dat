More generally, over the last year or so, the European Commission has largely completed the reform programme set out in the 2012 State aid modernisation initiative. The reach of the reforms has been considerable: almost every substantive State aid text has been subject to review and revision, and there have been important procedural changes, notably in relation to transparency and new requirements for evaluation. Overall, there has been a significant recalibration of policy. In some areas, the s cope of compatible aid has been enlarged. By contrast, in the area of regional aid, there has been a significant tightening of some aspects of policy – notably regarding support for large firms in ‘c’ areas and the treatment of large cases of aid in all assisted areas...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores {{cultural}} differences in risky choices between Australian and German students. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to challenge the wide-spread view that investment in residential property in East Germany after unification has turned out to be a financial disaster in most cases by calculating (1) the after-tax return an investor in real property might have expected at the beginning of the 1990 s and (2) the after-tax return that has been realized ten years after. We compare investments by a high-income investor resident in Germany in an average individually-owned flat in three major cities in East Germany and two cities in West Germany. The result of our study is that tax subsidies have protected investors from loosing money in a real estate investment. Therefore, it was indeed the taxpayers not the investors who have borne the cost of reconstructing East Germany. But taxpayers have spent a lot more on subsidising the much bigger West German housing market where property prices and tax subsidies per average investment were much higher. real-estate investment, after-tax return on investment, tax subsidies, <b>Assisted</b> <b>Area</b> Law (Fördergebietsgesetz), empirical study, income tax reduction, loss offset, special depreciation, return on equity capital (ROE), property prices...|$|E

40|$|Since the mid 1970 s, {{there have}} been {{attempts}} in West German regional policy to relocate jobs in the expanding service sector to the <b>assisted</b> <b>areas.</b> Based on the locational behaviour of the headquarters of industrial companies, the possibility and usefulness of a decentralisation of management jobs is examined. In view of the location requirements and the mobility of those tertiary functions requiring highly qualified personnel, an increasing importance accruing to the leading locations for headquarters can be expected. The financial incentives to relocate have proven too weak. A policy of forced decentralisation, however, would not be useful, because of the already decentralised location structure in West Germany when compared internationally. A further decentralisation would detract from {{the function of the}} leading locations as national growth centres and would endanger their international competitiveness. A policy to activate the endogenous development potential of disadvantaged regions is therefore more suitable than long-distance relocations of service industries to the <b>assisted</b> <b>areas.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 1860 on 07. 20. 2017 by CS (TIS) This thesis develops {{the argument that}} research on the European Community (EC) could be enriched by studies of how Community policies are implemented. The processes by which EC policies are formulated {{have been the subject}} of a great deal of research. However, the way in which these policies are subsequently put into practice and whether or not their objectives are achieved has received very little attention. Yet these processes may be highly complex, involving a large variety of institutions and actors at Community, national and regional levels. The complexity of implementation and of the Community's political system offers scope for a significant "implementation gap" between policy objectives and outcomes. This study is therefore about the implementation of EC regional policy. More specifically, it focus*is- on the operation in the United Kingdom of two Community Funds with regional objectives; namely, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF). In particular, the activities of the two Funds in South West England are examined. The research also assesses the roles in implementation of the European Commission and national government departments in the UK. The research shows that the UK government is able to influence many aspects of the implementation process by means of its pivotal role in decision-making and its ability to control many financial aspects of the provision of EC grants. As a result, the objectives of the ERDF and ESF may be overwhelmed by the entirely national objectives of government. On the other hand, this study demonstrates that the European Commission can exert some control in order to pursue the Funds' "Community" objectives. The organisations at regional level which actually apply for EC grants are also shown to be of importance. Their involvement is determined by factors such as government restrictions on expenditure, <b>assisted</b> <b>area</b> status, the availability of information, local iniciative and the efficiency of organisational structurcs. The research, which coincided with a period in which EC regional policy is being reformed, calls for more explicit concern in the future with how the Community's increasingly prominent regional development objectives are put into practice. Moreover, it asserts that studying how Community policies operate can help to shed more light on the nature of the EC's political system. Exeter Universit...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} new plant locations. In particular, the paper looks at whether discretionary government grants influence the location of new plants, and how effective these incentives are {{in the presence of}} agglomeration and urbanisation externalities – that is, benefits arising from locating near to other firms in the same industry or in an area with a diverse industrial structure. The specific government grants we consider are Regional Selective Assistance grants that are available in designated <b>Assisted</b> <b>Areas</b> of the UK. We examine these questions using data on new plant entrants to the production sector in Great Britain, together with matched information on Regional Selective Assistance grant offers. We look at those new entrants that appear a priori to be more mobile – new plants owned by existing firms, (either UK groups or foreign multinationals). Our findings are of interest in the context of government policies concerned with regional variation in economic performance. We find evidence that regional industrial structure affects the location of new entrants. Firms in more agglomerated industries locate new plants near to others in the same industry, and firms are also attracted to industrially diversified locations. In line with other work in this area we find that foreign multinationals locate new plants near to other foreign-owned plants in the same industry. Fiscal incentives in the form of Regional Selective Assistance grants are found to have some effect in attracting plants to <b>Assisted</b> <b>Areas.</b> Agglomeration, regional grants and firm locatio...|$|R
