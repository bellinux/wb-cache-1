5|$|During the 1980s, a Thrud {{comic strip}} {{was a regular}} and popular feature in the roleplay and wargame {{magazine}} White Dwarf with Thrud's grotesque and comic antics forming a memorable part of the magazine's golden age. In 2002, continued interest in the character from role-playing enthusiasts <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> be free to experiment with a new artistic style prompted Critchlow to self-publish a series of award-winning full-length Thrud the Barbarian comics.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Dallas {{following}} the season, Bégin signed {{a one-year contract}} with the Boston Bruins for the 2009–10 season. He played in 77 games for Boston, {{the most of any}} single season in his career, and recorded 14 points. He scored his first career playoff goal, in his 30th post-season game, against the Philadelphia Flyers. The Bruins opted not to re-sign the 32-year-old Bégin, due both to their salary cap constraints <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> build a younger lineup.|$|E

5|$|Rumours {{about his}} father's cowardice during the First Crusade, however, {{continued}} to circulate, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> avoid the same reputation {{may have influenced}} some of Stephen's rasher military actions. His wife, Matilda, {{played a major role}} in running their vast English estates, which contributed to the couple being the second-richest lay household in the country after the King. The landless Flemish nobleman William of Ypres had joined Stephen's household in 1133.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the British and French {{intervened in}} the Russian Civil War; this {{included}} a major naval deployment to the Baltic Sea, which included Waldeck-Rousseau. Shortly after arriving, her crew mutinied due to poor living conditions <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> return to France. The unrest was quickly suppressed, and Waldeck-Rousseau joined {{the effort to}} support the Whites against the Red Bolsheviks. In May 1929, the ship was sent to French Indochina {{to serve as the}} flagship of the Far East squadron. She remained there until May 1932, when she returned to France, where she was decommissioned and hulked. Waldeck-Rousseau was ultimately scrapped in 194144.|$|E
5|$|Hess did {{not build}} a power base or develop a coterie of followers. He was {{motivated}} by his loyalty to Hitler <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> be useful to him; he did not seek power or prestige or take advantage of his position to accumulate personal wealth. He lived in a modest house in Munich. Although Hess had less influence than other top NSDAP officials, he was popular with the masses. After the Invasion of Poland {{and the start of}} World War II in September 1939, Hitler made Hess second in line to succeed him, after Hermann Göring. Around the same time, Hitler appointed Hess's chief of staff, Martin Bormann, as his personal secretary, a post formerly held by Hess.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Strickland {{garnered}} positive critical {{comment for}} the romantic comedy Fever Pitch, and in 2007, {{she was a}} cast regular in the television show The Wedding Bells and subsequently {{was added to the}} cast of Private Practice. Strickland has spoken against the emphasis placed on beauty in the Los Angeles acting community, in which she says her Southern U.S. background has helped to distinguish herself from other blonde-haired actors. She has spoken of an affinity for her strong female characters <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> avoid sexualizing or sensationalizing her self-presentation as a woman. She also has worked closely with the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) after participating in a storyline in which her Private Practice character Charlotte King was raped.|$|E
5|$|Montreal {{finished}} {{in last place}} in the Northeast Division in 1998–99 and missed the playoffs. Their 75 points was the lowest total in a full season in 40 years. The season concluded with rumours of the team being sold and relocated {{if it did not}} receive government subsidies to help alleviate pressures from Quebec's tax system and the record-low value of the Canadian dollar. The Canadiens denied the report, however Molson hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to examine its future involvement in sports. Montreal missed the playoffs again the next two seasons, and annual losses of $10–$12million <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> focus on its core brewing business led Molson to put the franchise up for sale in the summer of 2001.|$|E

5|$|The {{compilation}} was one {{of several}} ideas Rare considered to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Inspired by fans, upcoming Xbox One backward compatibility features, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> link Rare's past and future, the company sorted through 120 games to choose titles that best represented its oeuvre. It prioritized games with characters and environments original to the company. Rare incorporated six hardware emulators in the package, and worked with its parent company, Microsoft, to use its unannounced Xbox 360 emulation. Rare Replay released worldwide as an Xbox One exclusive on August 4, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{the route}} chosen {{was a direct}} line between Saugus and Gorman, {{over the top of}} the ridge for many miles. Due to cost and {{drainage}} concerns, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> reduce altering the terrain, the road was built with 697curves, high in the mountains. Construction on the Ridge Route, officially considered to run from Castaic Junction (west of Saugus on the road to Ventura) to the bottom of the grade at Grapevine, began in 1914. The highway was one of the earliest projects completed by the California Highway Commission. To construct the road, horse-drawn scrapers were used.|$|E
5|$|When {{drafting}} the Belarus Constitution, the Supreme Soviet deputies {{were influenced by}} the constitutions of various countries, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United States. Internally, the Constitution {{was influenced by the}} period of Soviet domination <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> bring back traditions brushed aside by the Soviet Government. The structure of the Constitution is similar to the Russian Federation: for example, the office of the President has powers analogous to those granted to the President of Russia. Overall, the Constitution sought to preserve the statehood of Belarus from pro-Russian unity movements, provide a strong head of state that could cure the ailments Belarus would endure in the post-Soviet era, and lay out a compromise between the political factions in Belarus.|$|E

5|$|When fit, Gibbs {{had been}} Watford's first choice right-back since 1985, with the {{exception}} of 1994–95, where Gerard Lavin's form kept a recovering Gibbs in the reserves. A combination of Gibbs' age, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> acquire more strength in depth for the Premier League, prompted Taylor to sign right-backs Des Lyttle and Neil Cox in 1999. Despite the competition, Gibbs managed to make 20 appearances in 1999–2000, and his Premier League experience included victories over Chelsea, Coventry City and Southampton, although these were not enough to prevent relegation back to the First Division.|$|E
5|$|After touring Who's Next, and needing time {{to write}} a follow-up, Townshend insisted that the Who take a lengthy break, as they had not stopped touring since the band started. There was no group {{activity}} until May 1972, when they started working on a proposed new album, Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock!, but, unhappy with the recordings, abandoned the sessions. Tensions began to emerge as Townshend believed Daltrey just wanted a money-making band and Daltrey thought Townshend's projects were getting pretentious. Moon's behaviour was becoming increasingly destructive and problematic through excessive drinking and drugs use, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> party and tour. Daltrey performed an audit of the group's finances and discovered that Lambert and Stamp had not kept sufficient records. He believed them to be no longer effective managers, which Townshend and Moon disputed. The painful dissolution of the managerial and personal relationships are recounted in James D. Cooper's 2014 retrospective documentary, Lambert & Stamp. Following a short European tour, the remainder of 1972 was spent working on an orchestral version of Tommy with Lou Reizner.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at Cambridge Vaughan Williams {{continued}} his weekly lessons with Parry, and studied composition with Charles Wood and organ with Alan Gray. He graduated as Bachelor of Music in 1894 and Bachelor of Arts the following year. After leaving the university he returned to complete his training at the RCM. Parry had by then succeeded Sir George Grove {{as director of the}} college, and Vaughan Williams's new professor of composition was Charles Villiers Stanford. Relations between teacher and student were stormy. Stanford, who had been adventurous in his younger days, had grown deeply conservative; he clashed vigorously with his modern-minded pupil. Vaughan Williams had no wish to follow in the traditions of Stanford's idols, Brahms and Wagner, and he stood up to his teacher as few students dared to do. Beneath Stanford's bluster lay a recognition of Vaughan Williams's talent <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> help the young man correct his opaque orchestration and extreme predilection for modal music.|$|E

5|$|Due to the 1994–95 NHL lockout, Anderson went to Europe to play hockey. He {{played with}} the Augsburger Panther of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga in Germany and the Lukko Rauma of the SM-liiga in Finland, {{as well as the}} Canadian National Team. After the {{lock-out}} was resolved, Anderson {{signed as a free agent}} with the St. Louis Blues and played 42 regular season and playoff games combined. At the end of the season, Anderson did not re-sign with the Blues. After playing part of the next season with Augsburger and the National Team again, Anderson signed with the Canucks as a free agent. His reasons for joining the team were because of former Oiler teammate Esa Tikkanen already playing there, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> finish his career in his hometown. However, Anderson never played for the Canucks as the Oilers picked him up on re-entry waivers. Anderson expressed his disappointment at these turn of events, as he wanted to play in Vancouver instead. He spent 17 games with the Oilers, before being put on waivers that same season. The Blues claimed him, and he spent his last days in the NHL with them. The 1996–97 season saw Anderson return to Europe and play with HC La Chaux-de-Fonds of the National League A in Switzerland and with Bolzano HC of the Alpenliga in Italy.|$|E
5|$|In November 1994, the Siege of Bihać, {{a battle}} of the Bosnian War, entered a {{critical}} stage as the VRS and the ARSK came close to capturing the town of Bihać from the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). It was a strategic area and, since June 1993, Bihać {{had been one of}} six United Nations Safe Areas established in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The US administration felt that its capture by Serb forces would intensify the war and lead to a humanitarian disaster greater than any other in the conflict to that point. Amongst the United States, France and the United Kingdom, division existed regarding how to protect the area. The US called for airstrikes against the VRS, but the French and the British opposed them citing safety concerns <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> maintain the neutrality of French and British troops deployed {{as a part of the}} UNPROFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In turn, the US was unwilling to commit ground troops. On the other hand, the Europeans recognized that the US was free to propose military confrontation with the Serbs while relying on the European powers to block any such move, since French President François Mitterrand discouraged any military intervention, greatly aiding the Serb war effort. The French stance reversed after Jacques Chirac was elected president of France in May 1995, pressuring the British to adopt a more aggressive approach as well. Denying Bihać to the Serbs was also strategically important to Croatia, and General Janko Bobetko, the Chief of the Croatian General Staff, considered the potential fall of Bihać to represent an end to Croatia's war effort.|$|E
