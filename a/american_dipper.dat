5|$|Many birds call Adams home or a {{stopover}} {{on their}} migration routes. Songbirds include three species of chickadee, two kinglets, several thrushes, warblers, sparrows, and finches. One unique songbird {{to the high}} elevations is the gray-crowned rosy finch, who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. Raptors {{that live in the}} forest and meadows include Accipiters, red-tailed hawks, golden and bald eagles, ospreys, great horned owls, and falcons. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the hairy woodpecker, downy woodpecker, and white-headed woodpecker. Jays such as the Steller's jay and gray jay are common and the gray jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the Clark's nutcracker with its distinctive call. Swallows and swifts are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. Common mergansers and several other species of water birds can be found on many of the lakes as well. The <b>American</b> <b>dipper</b> with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several grouse species, the sooty, spruce, and ruffed grouse and the white-tailed ptarmigan, call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{of partial}} {{migrants}} {{provide an opportunity}} to assess the cost and benefits of migration. Previous work has demonstrated that sedentary <b>American</b> <b>dippers</b> (residents) have higher annual productivity than altitudinal migrants that move to higher elevations to breed. Here we use a ten-year (30 period) mark-recapture dataset to evaluate whether migrants offset their lower productivity with higher survival during the migration-breeding period when they occupy different habitat, or early and late-winter periods when they coexist with residents. Mark-recapture models provide no evidence that apparent monthly survival of migrants is higher than that of residents at any time of the year. The best-supported model suggests that monthly survival is higher in the migration-breeding period than winter periods. Another well-supported model suggested that residency conferred a survival benefit, and annual apparent survival (calculated from model weighted monthly apparent survival estimates using the Delta method) of residents (0. 511 ± 0. 038 SE) was slightly higher than that of migrants (0. 487 ± 0. 032). Winter survival of <b>American</b> <b>dippers</b> was influenced by environmental conditions; monthly apparent survival increased as maximum daily flow rates increased and declined as winter temperatures became colder. However, we found no evidence that environmental conditions altered differences in winter survival of residents and migrants. Since migratory <b>American</b> <b>dippers</b> have lower productivity and slightly lower survival than residents our data suggests that partial migration is likely an outcome of competition for limited nest sites at low elevations, with less competitive individuals being forced to migrate to higher elevations in order to breed...|$|R

40|$|Coal mining in the Elk River Valley, B. C. enhances natural {{release of}} {{selenium}} (Se), resulting in elevated concentrations of selenium downstream of the mines. Studies {{to determine the}} extent and significance of Se in Valley waters began in 1996. Selenium concentrations downstream of the five coal mines have increased in some areas. However, the same magnitude of increases has not occurred in lotic (flowing water) fauna, and Se concentrations in fish from lotic areas have not increased from 1996 to 2003. Although Se concentrations in cutthroat trout and some of their eggs were above concentrations shown to be toxic in other areas with other fish species, a laboratory effects study found that fry hatched and developed normally. Both cutthroat and bull trout populations have increased since 1986. A study of two common waterfowl (<b>American</b> <b>dippers</b> and spotted sandpipers) living in lotic areas found no discernable adverse effects, and Se concentrations in eggs were below thresholds at which adverse effects have been documented in other areas.

40|$|In {{nestling}} birds, begging typically signals short-term {{hunger and}} is often used by parents to allocate food within a brood. Although young birds continue to beg long after nest departure less {{is known about the}} information content of begging and its influence on parental allocation patterns post-fledging. We examined the function of begging in fledgling <b>American</b> <b>dippers</b> (Cinclus mexicanus) and the corresponding provisioning rules and response of parents to variation in begging. We found no evidence that begging intensity correlated to short-term hunger. However, fledglings begged at higher intensities in a year with lower food abundance and reduced parental provisioning rates, suggesting that begging may reflect long-term con-dition. Parental provisioning was influenced by fledgling begging early in the post-fledging period. In the first week after fledging parents preferred to feed the fledgling begging most in-tensely when choosing between two young, and returned with food more rapidly if fledglings were begging at a higher intensity. In the second week, parents provisioned at a lower rate and no longer adjusted return times in response to variation in fledgling begging intensity. Although the decline in parental responsiveness is consistent with parent-offspring conflict we argue this does not appear to drive the timing of independence in juvenile dippers...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} abundance, distribution, and habitat {{associations}} of the aquatic-foraging riparian-associated vertebrate community along four stream basins transecting managed {{forests in the}} Oregon Coast Range, 1992 - 1994. The riparian-associated community we observed consisted primarily of birds with few observations of mammals. Belted kingfishers (Ceryle alcyon), <b>American</b> <b>dippers</b> (Cinclus mexicanus), great blue herons (Ardea herodias), and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) comprised > 85 % of these observations, but we observed only one group (gtoreq 1 individual observed together) from this community for each kilometer of stream surveyed. Bird abundances among years were not different (all P > 0. 05). Species distribution was affected by stream order, stream basin, and season in each species, but to varying degrees. Belted kingfishers, common mergansers (Mergus merganser), great blue herons, green herons (Butorides striatus), and mallards were more abundant in larger, 6 th-orderstreams than in smaller, 4 th-order streams (P < 0. 05). Dippers used step channel units disproportionally more and riffles disproportionately less than expected (P < 0. 5). Similarly, kingfishers used fewer riffles and more pool channel units than was expected (P < 0. 5). Key habitat components that were predictive of use were species specific. Most notably, {{the presence of a}} forested riparian area, streamside trees, and valley walls that constrain the stream were important predictors of use by the three most abundant species; dippers, kingfishers, and great blue herons.

40|$|<b>American</b> <b>dippers</b> (Cinclus mexicanus) {{appear to}} {{concentrate}} at low elevation streams in fall and winter, implying {{some degree of}} migratory behavior in this species. Knowledge about the composition, origin and movement patterns of dipper populations are necessary to use this species as an effective biomonitor of trace contaminants in watersheds. During 1999 - 2002, I color banded 522 dippers and radio-tagged 14 in the Chilliwack River watershed, British Columbia, to follow their movements during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. During the annual cycle, most individuals (84 - 89 %) moved from the main river to higher elevation tributaries to breed, while small numbers (11 - 16 %) remained resident on the main river year round. Resident birds on the river initiated nests earlier, had greater proportions of second broods, and benefited from marginally higher rates of nest success and annual productivity than migrants on creeks. Later initiation of breeding by altitudinal migrants reduced productivity by increasing predation or flooding risk and prevented opportunities for initiating second clutches. Residue analysis of dipper eggs and prey items (benthic invertebrates and salmon fry) revealed DDE, hexachlorobenzene, trans-nonachlor and PCBs as the most prevalent organic contaminants detected. PCB and organochlorine patterns were highly consistent across sites in the Georgia Basin and between dipper eggs and prey, indicating common atmospheric sources to the region that were biomagnified in lotic food chains. Organochlorines, PCBs and mercury were all significantly higher in eggs from river residents compared to creek migrants. Feathers of residents also had higher concentrations of mercury, cadmium, and copper relative to migrants. However, levels of organic and metal contaminants in invertebrates differed minimally between the river and creeks. Observed differences in contaminant concentrations were primarily related to the proportion of salmon fry in dipper diets. Stable isotope analysis revealed that residents consumed significantly more fish than migrants. Blood [lowercase]delta [superscript] 15 N values were positively correlated with total organochlorines and total DDT in eggs suggesting that fish were {{the primary source of}} organic contamination.
