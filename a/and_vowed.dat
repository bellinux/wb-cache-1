5|$|On 26 July 2007, {{after an}} even deadlier crash in Brazil (TAM Airlines Flight 3054 on 17 July 2007) claimed {{the lives of}} 199 people, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva fired his defense minister, Waldir Pires, who had been in charge of the country's {{aviation}} infrastructure and safety since March 2006, and was widely criticized for their failures.

5|$|Although {{he was a}} {{newcomer}} to the Castro District, Milk had shown leadership in the small community. He was starting {{to be taken seriously}} as a candidate and decided to run again for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered his approach and cut his long hair, swore off marijuana, <b>and</b> <b>vowed</b> never to visit another gay bathhouse again. Milk's campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns for him—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.|$|E
5|$|In {{his reelection}} as the Second District congressman, Jennings {{supported}} tariff protection and internal improvements <b>and</b> <b>vowed</b> {{to support the}} presidential candidate that his constituents preferred if the election went to the House to decide the winner. Jennings won reelection to Congress in a close race, beating Jeremiah Sullivan of Madison. In the presidential election of 1824 American political parties organized around three candidates: Andrew Jackson running against John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. Jennings favored Adams, and later, Clay; however, when the contested presidential election passed to the House in 1825, Jennings voted with the majority and gave his political support to Jackson, but he was defeated in the House and Adams became president. Indiana voters who supported Jackson hoped for {{a victory in the}} next election.|$|E

5|$|James and Stratus teamed {{together}} at the March 18, 2006 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event to defeat Candice Michelle and Victoria. After the match, James agreed to honor Stratus' wishes and attempted to kiss her. After Stratus pushed her away, James attacked Stratus <b>and</b> <b>vowed</b> to destroy her, becoming a villain in the process {{for the first time}} in her WWE career. The feud between James and Stratus culminated in a Women's Championship match at WrestleMania 22, which James won, to earn her first Women's Championship. Her angle with Stratus continued into Backlash during a rematch, after Stratus legitimately dislocated her shoulder when James threw her out of the ring. The feud would come to an end on the June 26 episode of Raw, when James defeated Stratus in a Women's Championship match.|$|E
5|$|The {{next night}} on Raw, Triple H {{wrestled}} Heyman's newest client, Curtis Axel. He suffered a storyline concussion and was deemed to have forfeited. Despite being medically cleared to wrestle before the June 3 episode of Raw, Vince and Stephanie McMahon {{did not allow}} Triple H to wrestle Axel, citing concerns for his well-being {{and the safety of}} his children. In response, Triple H stormed out the arena <b>and</b> <b>vowed</b> to return to the ring the next week on Raw. On that episode, he lost to Axel when McMahon dubiously disqualified him, ordered Axel to leave the ring, then stole the bell and microphone to prevent the match from being restarted.|$|E
5|$|Though Nixon {{lost much}} popular support, even {{from his own}} party, he {{rejected}} accusations of wrongdoing <b>and</b> <b>vowed</b> to stay in office. He insisted {{that he had made}} mistakes, but had no prior knowledge of the burglary, did not break any laws, and did not learn of the cover-up until early 1973. On October 10, 1973, Vice President Agnew resigned —unrelated to Watergate— and was convicted on charges of bribery, tax evasion and money laundering during his tenure as Governor of Maryland. Nixon chose Gerald Ford, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, to replace Agnew. One researcher suggested Nixon effectively disengaged from his own administration after the swearing in of Gerald Ford as Vice President on December 6, 1973.|$|E

5|$|During the {{beginning}} of the second Bhutto Administration, a Bhutto family feud between Benazir and her mother, Nusrat Bhutto, surfaced over the political future of Murtaza Bhutto, Nusrat's son and Benazir's younger brother. Benazir thanked Zardari for his support. In September 1996, Murtaza and seven others died in a shootout with police in Karachi, while the city was undergoing a three-year civil war. At Murtaza's funeral, Nusrat accused Benazir and Zardari of being responsible <b>and</b> <b>vowed</b> to pursue prosecution. Ghinwa Bhutto, Murtaza's widow, also accused Zardari of being behind his killing. President Farooq Leghari, who would dismiss the Bhutto government seven weeks after Murtaza's death, also suspected Benazir and Zardari's involvement. Several of Pakistan's leading newspapers alleged that Zardari wanted his brother-in-law out of the way because of Murtaza's activities as head of a breakaway faction of the PPP.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, the Liberals gained {{office on}} Prince Edward Island. They {{immediately}} went about putting in place measures to gradually dismantle the proprietor/tenant system, although their efforts generally had limited effect largely because Samuel Cunard, who owned one-sixth of the Island, refused to sell {{any of his}} land. In 1864, the tenants organised into the Tenant League, <b>and</b> <b>vowed</b> to resist the collection of rent by their proprietors. Efforts by law enforcement to quell this rebellion had little effect, so {{the government of the}} island requested the assistance of British troops to enforce the collection of rent. In 1865, British troops arrived in the colony and successfully enforced the collection of the unpaid rent, and the Tenant League crumbled. It appeared that the operation of the Tenant League was a matter of principle rather than practical necessity; the rent paid by tenants to the proprietors was to the amount of one shilling per acre, and the proprietors allowed rent to go unpaid for years at a time.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, after pinning WWE Champion John Cena on Raw, Rey Mysterio at Capitol Punishment {{and finally}} Alberto Del Rio {{again in a}} contendership match (which also {{included}} Mysterio) all within one week, Punk revealed his contract would expire at Money in the Bank <b>and</b> <b>vowed</b> to leave the company with the WWE Championship. After making a scathing yet highly acclaimed on-air speech concerning {{the way in which}} WWE is run and its owner Vince McMahon, he was given a storyline suspension from televised WWE events but was reinstated the following week on Cena's insistence. Upon his return, Punk ceased to appear with the remaining members of Nexus and the group quietly dissolved that month. This helped transition him from a villainous character back to being a fan-favorite. Two weeks later, at Money in the Bank, Punk defeated John Cena to become the WWE Champion on his final night under contract with WWE.|$|E

5|$|In March 2011 a new {{reform of}} the Stability and Growth Pact was initiated, aiming at {{straightening}} the rules by adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the 3% deficit or the 60% debt rules. By {{the end of the}} year, Germany, France and some other smaller EU countries went a step further <b>and</b> <b>vowed</b> to create a fiscal union across the eurozone with strict and enforceable fiscal rules and automatic penalties embedded in the EU treaties. On 9 December 2011 at the European Council meeting, all 17 members of the eurozone and six countries that aspire to join agreed on a new intergovernmental treaty to put strict caps on government spending and borrowing, with penalties for those countries who violate the limits. All other non-eurozone countries apart from the UK are also prepared to join in, subject to parliamentary vote. The treaty will enter into force on 1 January 2013, if by that time 12 members of the euro area have ratified it.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1954, General Nguyễn Văn Hinh, {{the head}} of the State of Vietnam's VNA, {{announced}} that he did not respect the leadership of Prime Minister Diệm, <b>and</b> <b>vowed</b> to overthrow him. The coup never materialised and Hinh was forced into exile, but not before appointing Ba Cụt to the rank of colonel in the VNA in an attempt to undermine Diệm, as the Hòa Hảo warlord was openly contemptuous of the prime minister. In August, Ba Cụt and his 3,000 men broke from the VNA and left their Thốt Nốt base for the jungle, and fought against those who had briefly been their comrades; this put him at odds with most Hòa Hảo leaders, who accepted government payments to integrate their forces into the VNA. Operation Ecaille, the initial military offensive by the VNA against Ba Cụt was a failure, possibly because the details of the planned attack on his forces were leaked to him by Soái, a Hòa Hảo member of the National Defence Committee.|$|E
5|$|Manuel's {{attention}} was again drawn to Antioch in 1156, when Raynald of Châtillon, the new Prince of Antioch, {{claimed that the}} Byzantine emperor had reneged on his promise to pay him a sum of money <b>and</b> <b>vowed</b> to attack the Byzantine province of Cyprus. Raynald arrested {{the governor of the}} island, John Komnenos, who was a nephew of Manuel, and the general Michael Branas. The Latin historian William of Tyre deplored this act of war against fellow Christians and described the atrocities committed by Raynald's men in considerable detail. Having ransacked the island and plundered all its wealth, Raynald's army mutilated the survivors before forcing them to buy back their flocks at exorbitant prices with what little they had left. Thus enriched with enough booty to make Antioch wealthy for years, the invaders boarded their ships and set sail for home.* T. F. Madden, The New Concise History of the Crusades, 65 Raynald also sent some of the mutilated hostages to Constantinople as a vivid demonstration of his disobedience and his contempt for the Byzantine emperor.|$|E

5|$|On 24 February 2009 Stockport {{agreed to}} allow Gannon to hold talks with Brighton & Hove Albion, who were seeking to fill the {{managerial}} position left vacant by Micky Adams. He suggested that his family would play a large part in his decision to move clubs, with Stockport's financial troubles looming but uprooting his family to move to Brighton being undesirable. Gannon was made favourite {{to be given the}} job by several bookmakers, and he met with Brighton chairman Dick Knight on the 25th, before announcing on the 26th that he had chosen not to take the job. Knight had indicated that Gannon was his first choice for the job, and former Stockport players now at Brighton had shown their desire for Gannon to be given the job. However, Gannon turned down the opportunity <b>and</b> <b>vowed</b> stay with at the Edgeley Park club.|$|E
5|$|On 25 February 2012, in a {{match against}} Wigan Athletic, Bent landed awkwardly on his ankle after {{tangling}} with Antolín Alcaraz. He was stretchered off the pitch {{with what was}} thought to be a serious injury. This was later confirmed two days later, after Bent had a scan on his ankle that revealed he had ruptured ligaments. He was out for three months which effectively ended his season with Villa and most likely his chance to play at UEFA Euro 2012. Bent had recovered from his injury by mid-May and was in contention for Villa's final match of 2011–12 against Norwich City but was ultimately left out. This also gave him the possibility of making new England manager Roy Hodgson's Euro 2012 England squad. Bent vowed to prove his fitness to Hodgson, in the hope he would be selected to play in the tournament. Bent once again finished as Villa's top scorer with 10 goals in 25 appearances <b>and</b> <b>vowed</b> to stay on at the club.|$|E
5|$|Queer as Folk 2 was {{broadcast}} in February 2000 and {{was driven by}} the plot element of Vince's half-sister's wedding.

On the heels of the special, Davies pitched the spin-off Misfits, a late-night soap opera set in a boarding house owned by Vince's mother, Hazel, and The Second Coming, a series that depicted the Second Coming of Christ in contemporary Manchester. Misfits was rejected in December 2000 and The Second Coming was initially approved by Channel 4 but later rejected after a change of executive personnel.
