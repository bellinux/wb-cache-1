25|$|Despite his militarist {{convictions}} at {{this time}} Collins found the psychological strain caused by {{his involvement in the}} terrorist war increasingly difficult to deal with. His belief in the martial discipline of IRA's campaign had been seriously undermined by the event of the assassination of Norman Hanna, a 28 year old Newry man on the 11 March 1982 in front of his wife and young daughter, who had been targeted because of his former service with the Ulster Defence Regiment, which he had resigned from in 1976. Collins had opposed the targeting of Hanna on the basis that it wasn't of a governmental entity, but had been over-ruled by his superiors, and he had gone along with the operation; his conscience burdened him afterwards about it though. His uneasy state was further augmented by being arrested under anti-terrorism laws on two occasions, the second involving his detention at Gough Barracks in Armagh for a week, where he was subject to extensive sessions of interrogation in 1985 after an IRA mortar attack in Newry, which had claimed the lives of multiple police officers. Collins had not been involved in this operation, but after five days of incessant psychological pressure being exerted by R.U.C. specialist police officers, during which he had not said <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> <b>he</b> mentally broke, and yielded detailed information to the police about the organization. As a result of his arrest he was dismissed from his career with H.M. Customs & Excise Service.|$|E
25|$|Samuel ben Ḥofni wrote, besides, an Arabic {{translation}} of the Pentateuch with a commentary, a commentary {{on some of the}} Prophets, and perhaps a commentary on Ecclesiastes (see Harkavy, l.c. iii. 24, note 59; Poznanski, l.c. ii. 55, note 5). M. I. Israelsohn (Samuelis b. Hofni Trium Sectionum Posteriorum Libri Genesis Versio Arabica cum Commentario, St. Petersburg, 1886) has published a portion of Samuel's Pentateuch translation (Gen. xli.-l.) with commentary. The deficiencies in these edited fragments might be supplied by the citations in Abraham Maimonides' commentary on Genesis and Exodus (Neubauer, Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS. No. 276). The German {{translation of}} a specimen of these fragments is given in Winter and Wünsche (l.c. ii. 254). The fragments show that Samuel's {{translation of the}} Pentateuch was dependent upon, though it was more literal than, that of Saadia, which had been written almost one hundred years earlier. In contrast to Saadia, Samuel gives Hebrew proper names in their original form. Grammatical notes occupy a remarkably small space in his verbose commentary, and his grammatical point of view was that taken by scholars before the time of Ḥayyuj. On the other hand, he gives careful consideration to the chronology of Bible accounts, and in explaining <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>he</b> gives all its various meanings besides references to its occurrence elsewhere. His source is the midrashic and Talmudic literature, though he specifically mentions only the Seder Olam and the Targum Onḳelos (see Bacher in R. E. J. xv. 277, xvi. 106 et seq.).|$|E

500|$|As Hornsby {{recalled}} later, Ruth [...] "didn't say <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> <b>He</b> didn't {{even look}} around or up at me. He just picked {{himself up and}} walked away". Ruth's failed attempt to steal second base ended {{the game and the}} 1926 World Series; it is, as of 2016, the only time a World Series has ended with a runner being caught stealing. Ruth explained later that he attempted to steal second base because he thought no one would expect it. He hoped that by getting to second base, he could have an easier chance at scoring if Meusel hit a single into the outfield.|$|E

He maintained order {{through a series of}} hand signals; without saying <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>he</b> could order complimentary drinks and gifts for a party at any given table. Billingsley was also able to summon the club's private limousine to whisk favored customers away to a theater date or a ballgame after drinks or dining at the Stork. He changed the meaning of the hand signals frequently to avoid regular patrons' being able to read them. [...] Guests dined on the finest wines and cuisine, and it was known for its Champagne and caviar. The club gained worldwide attention for its cocktails, made by chief barman Nathaniel [...] "Cookie" [...] Cook.|$|E
500|$|This leads Hazlitt to {{consider}} why, when Falstaff [...] "is {{represented as a}} liar, a braggart, a coward, a glutton, etc., [...] we are not offended but delighted with him [...]" [...] The answer is that [...] "he is all these as much to amuse others as to gratify himself. He openly assumes all these characters to shew the humourous part of them. The unrestrained indulgence of his own ease, appetites, and convenience, has neither malice nor hypocrisy in it. In <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> <b>he</b> is an actor in himself {{almost as much as}} upon the stage, and we no more object to the character of Falstaff in a moral point of view than we should think of bringing an excellent comedian, who should represent him to the life, before one of the police offices." ...|$|E

Then, when reading <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> <b>he</b> learns to say each sound in the word (e.g. /k/ - /a/ - /t/); and to [...] "blend" [...] these sounds into a pronunciation of the word (e.g. [...] "cat").|$|E
2500|$|People {{crowd around}} Wilson when he works {{and he has}} been praised by passersby. He has become a local celebrity as his work has chronicled the changes in the neighborhood. He has a large book where he keeps {{backlogged}} requests for paintings, such as births and deaths, marriages or some other personal commemoration. He does not charge for gum painting requests, <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>he</b> prefers to use over [...] "commissions". When he was arrested in 2009 by the City of London Police on suspicion of criminal damage, the case was dropped after dozens of people wrote letters of support a few months later.

2500|$|Blackford's Reports were {{thorough}} and detailed thanks to Blackford's {{effort to keep}} them accurate. His reputation for accuracy became well known. On one occasion a lawyer arguing before the court seeking to delay a decision questioned Blackford on the spelling of the word [...] "jenny", a female donkey, <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>he</b> knew {{would be in the}} report. Blackford responded with the spelling and lawyer again questioned him if he was certain that word was not spelt [...] "jennie". Not wanting to be hasty and enter an incorrectly spelt word onto the record, Blackford delayed the decision for two days while experts were consulted as to the proper spelling. By the time the answer had come the court session had ended and decision was delayed for several months.|$|E

2500|$|Huxley's {{courses for}} {{students}} {{were so much}} narrower than the man himself that many were bewildered by the contrast: [...] "The teaching of zoology by use of selected animal types has come in for much criticism"; Looking back in 1914 to his time as a student, Sir Arthur Shipley said [...] "Darwin's later works all dealt with living organisms, yet our obsession was with the dead, with bodies preserved, and cut into the most refined slices". E.W MacBride said [...] "Huxley... would persist in looking at animals as material structures and not as living, active beings; in <b>a</b> <b>word...</b> <b>he</b> was a necrologist.

2500|$|The Muppets {{were created}} by {{puppeteer}} Jim Henson in the 1950s, beginning with Kermit the Frog, who would become Henson's signature character. Originally conceived as characters aimed at an adult audience, Henson stated that the term [...] "Muppet" [...] had been created as an amalgamation of the words [...] "marionette" [...] and [...] "puppet", but also claimed that it was actually <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>he</b> had coined. In 1955, the Muppets were introduced on Sam and Friends, a television program that aired on WRC-TV in Washington D.C. Conceptualized by Jim and eventual wife Jane Henson, the series was notable for being the first form of puppet media not to include a physical proscenium arch within which the characters are presented, relying instead on the natural framing of the television set through which the program was viewed.|$|E

She brought the person a candle, and noticed that he wore a large cloak. The moment she had handed him the candle, however, he threw off the cloak and [...] "presented a most hideous and frightful appearance", vomiting blue and white flame from his mouth while his eyes resembled [...] "red balls of fire".

2500|$|In 1895–1896 Bunin divided {{his time}} between Moscow and Saint Petersburg. In 1897 his first short story {{collection}} To the Edge of the World and Other Stories came out, followed a year later by In the Open Air (Под открытым небом, 1898), his second book of verse. In June 1898 Bunin moved to Odessa. Here he became close to the Southern Russia Painters Comradeship, became friends with Yevgeny Bukovetski and Pyotr Nilus. In the winter of 1899–1900 he began attending the Sreda (Wednesday) literary group in Moscow, striking up a friendship with the Nikolay Teleshov, among others. Here the young writer made himself quite a reputation as an uncompromising advocate of the realistic traditions of classic Russian literature. [...] "Bunin made everybody uncomfortable.
