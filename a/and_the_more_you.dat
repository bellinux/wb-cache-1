The episode guest starred actors Suzie Plakson, Kevin Michael Richardson, Fred Tatasciore and Wally Wingert. Recurring guest voice actors included writer and animator Butch Hartman and actor Patrick Bristow. Much of the episode's humor is structured around cutaway sequences that parody popular culture, including references to Speed Racer, Happy Days, Nova, One Day at a Time, <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>More</b> <b>You</b> Know.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{observed}} 12 Monkeys {{depiction of}} the future, finding similarities with Blade Runner (1982; also scripted by David Peoples) and Brazil (1985; also directed by Terry Gilliam). [...] "The film is a celebration of madness and doom, with a hero who tries to prevail against the chaos of his condition, and is inadequate", Ebert wrote. [...] "This vision is a cold, dark, damp one, and even the romance between Willis and Stowe feels desperate rather than joyous. All of this is done very well, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> know about movies (especially the technical side), the more you're likely to admire it. And as entertainment, it appeals more to the mind than to the senses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Limestone Lad was {{scheduled}} to be offered for sale as a three-year-old gelding at Tattersalls Ireland in June 1995, but was withdrawn from the auction after the auctioneer's vet found that he had an abnormal heartbeat. The gelding was officially trained throughout his racing career by James Bowe, although the day-to-day handling was managed by his son Michael on the family farm which was also home to 60 cattle and 150 sheep. Commenting on the process of training the horse Michael Bowe said [...] "Everything you taught him, you had to do it slowly and carefully - but once he picked it up he would die or do it. He was so genuine, all {{he wanted to do was}} to please you". [...] He was often subjected to demanding schedules, with few breaks: Bowe explained the strategy by saying [...] "He is happiest racing frequently <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>you</b> take him racing the more he likes it".|$|E

Although in initial interviews she refused to reveal the title or concept, she said the album was personal to her. [...] "You can't help but put not only your kids into it, but to put anything you are going through in your music", she said. [...] "he {{only thing you can}} really sing or write is stuff that you know.

[...] In October 2009, People magazine revealed that Lopez's album was going to be called Love?.

[...] Lopez told The Advocates Brandon Voss that she also took into account the gay community and how they might feel towards the album. She said all her previous albums had a universal appeal and the LGBT community had played a part in the success of her music in the past, e.g. [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] (1999).|$|E
2500|$|While on set filming for The Back-up Plan in June 2009, Lopez {{revealed}} to MTV's Larry Carol {{that she had}} been working on the follow-up album to 2007's Brave. She had been working on the album during pregnancy, {{but it was not until}} the birth of her twins, Max and Emme, that she was able to focus on the project. Carol asked about the direction of the album, but Lopez refused to comment, instead saying [...] "You can't help but put not only your kids into it, but to put anything you are going through in your music.

[...] At the time of the interview, two of the album's songs had leaked. The first, titled [...] "(What Is) Love?", was written by Wynter Gordon and co-written and produced by Emile Dernst II (D'Mile). After expressing dismay at the song's leak, its writer (Wynter Gordon) spoke of why the song was very personal to her: [...] " [...] not knowing what love is ...I felt like so many woman have that same story. No fathers, families, abusive boyfriends and husbands..no parental support, they feel alone [...]. I've had my few relationships and have yet to feel love [...]" [...] Jean Baptist produced a 'part-two' for the song, which was mentioned at one of the album pre-release parties, attended by Rap-Up magazine, however the second part of the song was omitted from the track listing.
