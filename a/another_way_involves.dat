50|$|Once {{the unit}} cell {{of a new}} phase is known, {{the next step is}} to {{establish}} the stoichiometry of the phase. This can be done in a number of ways. Sometimes the composition of the original mixture will give a clue, if one finds only one product -a single powder pattern- or if one was trying to make a phase of a certain composition by analogy to known materials but this is rare.Often considerable effort in refining the synthetic methodology is required to obtain a pure sample of the new material.If it is possible to separate the product from the rest of the reaction mixture elemental analysis can be used. <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> <b>involves</b> SEM and the generation of characteristic X-rays in the electron beam. The easiest way to solve the structure is by using single crystal X-ray diffraction.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDirect {{methods are}} {{becoming}} the most used technique to solve nonlinear optimal control problems. Regular time meshes having equidistant spacing are frequently used. However, {{in some cases}} these meshes cannot cope accurately with nonlinear behavior. One way to improve {{the solution is to}} select a new mesh with a greater number of nodes. <b>Another</b> <b>way,</b> <b>involves</b> adaptive mesh refinement. In this case, the mesh nodes have non equidistant spacing which allow a non uniform nodes collocation. In the method presented in this paper, a time mesh refinement strategy based on the local error is developed. After computing a solution in a coarse mesh, the local error is evaluated, which gives information about the subintervals of time domain where refinement is needed. This procedure is repeated until the local error reaches a user-specified threshold. The technique is applied to solve the car-like vehicle problem aiming minimum consumption. The approach developed in this paper leads to results with greater accuracy and yet with lower overall computational time as compared to using a time meshes having equidistant spacing...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBifurcation {{phenomena}} of equilibrium states occur in both standard and complex materials. In this paper we study the equilibrium configurations {{close to a}} bifurcation point. In particular the {{attention is focused on}} bifurcations of pitchfork type [S. H. Strogatz, Non Linear Dynamics and Chaos, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1994]. This problem is usually solved by using the Signorini’s compatibility of the solution expansion in a neighborhood of the critical point. We show how the same results can be reached in <b>another</b> <b>way</b> which <b>involves</b> just the linear term of the solution expansion. As a test, we analyze two bifurcation phenomena: the buckling of an elastic beam under an axial load and the magnetic field-induced optical switch in nematic liquid crystals...|$|R

40|$|Reading {{aloud to}} {{children}} {{is the most}} important step towards making a child a reader. It exposes them to print and excites their curiosity through intriguing story lines. Parents play an enormous role in this aspect of reading development, because it begins long before a child is in school. In the beginning of school, teachers spend time assessing a child's reading ability. One way to assess phonemic awareness and further develop reading ability is through invented spelling in journal writing. Teachers must keep up the momentum of this development by allowing children plenty of time for reading and writing. <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> to <b>involve</b> students, is through the "Language Experience Approach " which enables children to write and read their own books. Explicit phonics instruction that emphasizes a relationship between letters is also necessary. One technique used to emphasize letters, word patterns, and spelling is a "Making Words Activity. " Others include spelling tests (where sounds are exaggerated), rules instruction, and drill...|$|R
40|$|The Picture of Abjection is an {{analysis}} of independent, contemporary, international film. Appropriating Kristeva's analysis of abjection, which she developed {{in the context of}} psychoanalytic theory to designate that which a subject rejects as a site of impurity, the book takes up the abject in order to illuminate various intersections of discrimination. The focus is on how race, gender, class, sexuality, ethnicity and nationality intersect with one <b>another</b> in <b>ways</b> that <b>involve</b> abjection. The argument is informed by a variety of disciplines, including film theory, psychoanalysis, philosophy and gender theory. The aim of the book is to enhance understanding of how film can both engage in and ameliorate the ways forms of discrimination play off one anothe...|$|R

40|$|We explore ways {{to reduce}} the number of bit {{operations}} required to implement AES. One <b>way</b> <b>involves</b> optimizing the composite field approach for entire rounds of AES. <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> is integrating the Galois multiplications of MixColumns with the linear transformations of the S-box. Combined with careful optimizations, these reduce the number of bit operations to encrypt one block by 9. 0 %, compared to earlier work that used the composite field only in the S-box. For decryption, the improvement is 13. 5 %. This work may be useful both as a starting point for a bit-sliced software implementation, where reducing operations increases speed, and also for hardware with limited resources...|$|R
