50|$|Satellites {{have been}} used to image the sea surface using optical and radar techniques, and it is claimed these might be used for {{indirect}} detection of submarines, as could thermal imaging. Fixed-wing aircraft, such as the P-3 Orion & Tu-142 provide both a sensor and weapons platform similar to some helicopters like the SH-60 Seahawk, with sonobuoys and/or dipping sonars as well as aerial torpedoes. In other cases the helicopter has been used solely for sensing and rocket delivered torpedoes used as the weapon. Surface ships continue to be a main ASW platform because of their endurance, now having towed array sonars. Submarines are the main ASW platform because of their ability to change depth and their quietness, which <b>aids</b> <b>detection.</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Cryptococcosis, a {{systemic}} disease {{caused by the}} fungus Cryptococcus neoformans/ Cryptococcus gattii is more severe in immunocompromised individuals. This study aimed to analyze the epidemiology of the disease, the molecular characteristics and the antifungal susceptibility of C. neoformans isolated from patients treated in a Brazilian university hospital. This retrospective {{study was conducted in}} the Clinical Hospital, Federal University of Uberlândia, and evaluated cases of cryptococcosis and strains of C. neoformans isolated from 2004 to 2013. We evaluated 41 patients, 85 % of whom were diagnosed with AIDS. The fungus was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 21 patients (51 %); 19. 5 % had fungemia and in 24 % the agent was isolated from the CSF and blood, concurrently. Meningoencephalitis was the most frequent (75 %) manifestation of infection. Despite adequate treatment, the mortality of the disease was 58. 5 %. Most isolates (97. 5 %) presented the VNI genotype (serotype A, var. grubii) and one isolate was genotyped as C. gattii (VGI); all the isolates were determined as mating type MATa and showed susceptibility to the tested antifungals (fluconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B and 5 -flucytosine). Although <b>AIDS</b> <b>detection</b> rates remain stable, opportunistic infections such as cryptococcosis remain as major causes of morbidity and mortality in these patients...|$|E
40|$|Detection and {{classification}} of underwater mines among natural formations and debris along {{the sea floor}} is a tedious task. In order to overcome such scenario an automated computer <b>aided</b> <b>detection</b> and classification system is required. Image processing techniques are used to improve the performance of mine hunting operations using sector-scan, side-scan, magnetometers, cameras, etc. This paper serve as a strategic review {{of the potential for}} image processing techniques to <b>aid</b> the <b>detection</b> and {{classification of}} underwater mines and mine-like objects in side scan sonar imagery. Five basic components of any Computer-Aided Detection and Classification (CAD/CAC) technique are considered namely image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, computer <b>aided</b> <b>detection</b> and computer <b>aided</b> classification.

40|$|Seagrasses {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} and widespread yet threatened coastal ecosystems on Earth. Despite their importance, they are declining due to various threats, which are mainly anthropogenic. Lack of data on their distribution hinders any effort to rectify this decline through effective detection, mapping and monitoring. Remote sensing can mitigate this data gap by allowing retrospective quantitative assessment of seagrass beds over large and remote areas. In this paper, we evaluate the quantitative application of Planet high resolution imagery for the detection of seagrasses in the Thermaikos Gulf, NW Aegean Sea, Greece. The low Signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR), which characterizes spectral bands at shorter wavelengths, prompts the application of the Unmixing-based denoising (UBD) as a pre-processing step for seagrass detection. A total of 15 spectral-temporal patterns is extracted from a Planet image time series to restore the corrupted blue and green band in the processed Planet image. Subsequently, we implement Lyzenga’s empirical water column correction and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to evaluate quantitative benefits of denoising. Denoising <b>aids</b> <b>detection</b> of Posidonia oceanica seagrass species by increasing its producer and user accuracy by 31. 7 % and 10. 4 %, correspondingly, with a respective increase in its Kappa value from 0. 3 to 0. 48. In the near future, our objective is to improve accuracies in seagrass detection by applying more sophisticated, analytical water column correction algorithms to Planet imagery, developing time- and cost-effective monitoring of seagrass distribution that will enable in turn the effective management and conservation of these highly valuable and productive ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Single-cell DNA {{analysis}} is not routinely {{carried out in}} a forensic setting as it is considered unreliable due to challenges associated with DNA amplification, contamination and profile interpretation. In light {{of the development of}} increasingly sensitive techniques, the question of the reliability of single-cell DNA analysis in terms of both processing and interpretation is addressed {{in the first part of}} this thesis. Optimising all stages of the DNA analysis process has provided a sensitive method which facilitates the successful outcome of a useable profile from single-cells. Although no consensus profile can be generated for this sample type, interpretation guidelines have been set to enable the robust analysis of single cells. It has been concluded that single-cells can be reliably amplified and profiled for forensic purposes. Both DNA and textile fibres have a proven track record in forensic casework yet their {{analysis is}} rarely combined. As an application of the aforementioned single-cell DNA analysis, this project explores the possibility that when fibres are transferred from one surface to another, they could also be acting as a vector for the wearer’s own DNA, through cells that have adhered to the fibre surfaces. Fluorescent staining and microscopy is used to detect the cells in situ on the fibre surface, which are then recovered and processed for DNA using the previously optimised single-cell analysis methods, along with a newly developed DNA assay designed for the amplification of low DNA template samples. The results of this study have demonstrated that cells can be visualised in situ on the fibre surface and that there is potential for cell transfer to occur. It has been concluded however, that from a casework point of view, targeting transferred fibres for cells may not be the best approach as it is time consuming and has not been shown to be effective in this study. The final part of this thesis is focused on the efficacy of massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technology for samples that are expected to be severely degraded due to age or exposure to a hostile environment. The ability of both the recently launched Illumina ForenSeq™ DNA Signature Prep Kit for nuclear DNA markers and an in-house method for the sequencing of degraded mitochondrial DNA, have been tested to determine if MPS offers a more comprehensive evaluation of degraded material than the traditional PCR-CE methods. The results of the ForenSeq kit have demonstrated the effectiveness of its low molecular weight STR and SNP markers for amplifying low template, degraded DNA samples, with alleles amplified using less than 20 pg total DNA input. This kit has also therefore shown application in the field of bioarchaeology, as it can provide the biological sex of the sample, biogeographic ancestry information and also <b>aids</b> <b>detection</b> of sample/control contamination. The in-house mitochondrial DNA assay resulted in the successful amplification and sequencing of samples for which no nuclear DNA was amplified. The high depth of read coverage in these samples, average of 18, 000, allowed for the identification of even low level variants...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the impact of}} HIV/AIDS on the perceptions, attitudes and behaviors of various groups of people that may effect TB transmission, prevention and care. Methods: The {{study was conducted in}} Chiang Rai, the northernmost province of Thailand with some of the highest rates of TB and HIV. The study employed qualitative and quantitative methods: (i) adherence to the 9 -month TB preventive therapy among people with HIV infection (PLWH) was investigated by pill count, in-depth interviews were used with poor- adherent cases while focus group discussions (FGD) were utilized with the good-adherent cases; (ii) perceptions about TB, HIV and the feasibility of implementing Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) was investigated through FGD with health providers, patients, community people, drug users and people living with HIV; (iii) health seeking behavior of HIV- positive TB patients (TB (HIV+)) and HIV-negative TB patients (TB (HIV-)) was investigated through interviews with patients using a structured questionnaire; (iv) the lifestyles before and after the TB diagnosis of TB (HIV+) and TB (HIV-) of patients were examined by conducting repeated home visits during a period of 6 - 8 months applying indepth interviews and observations. Major findings: (i) The adherence rate to TB-preventive therapy among PLWH, defined as the proportion of those who took more than 80 % of the pills was 67. 5 % (n= 278). Default took place at the early phase of the therapy. Females displayed a significantly higher adherent rate than males (OR 3. 45 : 95 %CI 1. 79 - 6. 67). Major reasons for non-adherence included migration due to work, denial of HIV status and perceived medicinal side effects. Important reasons motivating adherence were the concern for children and family and good provider relationships; (as) In general, people expressed a high awareness of AIDS symptoms and transmission causes but had an inadequate knowledge regarding TB. AIDS stigma and several misconceptions of TB-associated AIDS caused a delay in seeking TB service and a non-adherence to TB treatment in some patients who suspected they had AIDS and therefore, feared <b>AIDS</b> <b>detection.</b> Most TB (HIV-) patients were labeled as having AIDS by their family and community; (iii) The high mortality of TB (HIV+) and HIV-related complications in TB patients negatively affected the credibility of the TB treatment and influenced the attitudes of the health staff and the community resulting in perceived low priority or low motivation to treat TB for HIV infected persons expecting that the patients would eventually die from AIDS; (iv) In the HIV epidemic area, both health center-based DOT and home-based DOT have their problems. TB (HIV+) patients were usually too sick to visit a health center independently on a daily basis. These patients frequently suffered from other opportunistic infections and drug reactions. Therefore, the ability of the health center staff in clinical management during the implementation of home-based DOT was challenging. The health staff had low motivation to implement DOT unless financial incentives were offered. However, the monetary demand could be avoided if staff are well informed about the risk of multi-drug resistant TB and how to safeguard their own health; (v) The median patient delays for TB (HIV+), TB (HIV-) and TB (HIV unknown) were 10, 15 and 15 days, respectively. The risk factors for long patient delays (> 21 days) included being HIV-negative, having no health insurance, being of hill-tribe ethnicity, having had no previous visits to the hospital and needing to borrow money for the hospital visits. Provider delay was significantly longer for female patients than male patients; (vi) clinically, socially and financially, the TB (HIV+) patients suffered more than the TB (HIV-) patients. The TB (HIV+) patients suffered more complications and had more problems in drug taking. The AIDS stigma led to the discrimination of TB (HIV+) patients and their exclusion from social activities as well as the negative effect on family income including the loss of their job; (vii) Following the Grounded Theory tradition, the study developed a model presenting that the risk of TB and HIV transmissions may be attributed to the following: role and responsibility, virtue, stigma, learning for life, human bond and accepting fate. Conclusion: HIV/AIDS provides a graphic and tragic example of complex interactions between the disease agent and human behavior, which further complicates the patient's care-seeking behavior, adherence to the therapy and the effort to control tuberculosis. Despite the enormous clinical and social impact of HIV/AIDS on TB, some socio-cultural interventions may improve TB prevention and care...|$|E

40|$|The {{main reason}} behind {{pulmonary}} emphysema is mainly due to long-term smoking, and medical treatments are quite difficult. In worst cases, {{the structure of}} the lung can get damaged irreversibly. In this case, {{one of the most important}} parts is to detect the different stages of the diseases. This requires some well-trained radiologists to observe the changes in the CT scans of the patients over a period of time. But there is dearth of well trained radiologists worldwide. Hence, it would of great help if an accurate computer <b>aided</b> <b>detection</b> (CAD) system for emphysema is developed. Emphysema region classification from CT image is a time consuming process because there exists many sub-regions because of the huge size of CT image. There exists some sub-regions which contain no sign of Emphysema and the classification of these regions is meaningless. In order to speed up the process of classification, an algorithm has been proposed for selecting the Emphysema affected regions which is region of interest. Then only Emphysema affected region is used for classification instead of all of the sub-regions. General Terms Computer <b>aided</b> <b>detection</b> (CAD) system...|$|R
