5|$|For {{the entire}} tour, Ring took 60 {{first-class}} wickets at a bowling average of 21.81, {{the most expensive}} among Australia's frontline bowlers. As England agreed {{to have a new}} ball available 55 overs after the start of each innings in the Tests—more frequently than usual—fast bowling dominated over spin, <b>and</b> <b>Ring</b> was used primarily in the non-Test tour matches. Outside the Tests, only Bill Johnston bowled more overs, <b>and</b> <b>Ring</b> was used to relieve the workload on Bradman's pace spearheads to keep them fresh for the Tests. Ring scored 150 first-class runs at a batting average of 16.66 during the tour, and a top-score of 53 was his only effort beyond 50.|$|E

5|$|The fifth Test, {{which saw}} {{the debut of}} Richie Benaud {{alongside}} Ring, was an anticlimax, <b>and</b> <b>Ring</b> contributed little with either bat or ball to a large Australian victory. In the series as a whole, among the regular players, Ring finished behind only Hassett and Miller as a batsman, with 197 runs {{at an average of}} 28.14, and he took 13 wickets for exactly 30 apiece.|$|E
5|$|Australia batted first after Hassett won the toss, and {{the opening}} pair of Brown and Morris put on 139. Brown scored his third century in succession, before being out lbw to Indian Test player Abdul Hafeez Kardar for 108. Morris, Loxton, McCool <b>and</b> <b>Ring</b> all reached 50 as the Australians posted 431. Oxford's best batting {{performance}} {{came in the form}} of a 75-run partnership between Geoffrey Keighley and Kardar in their first innings, resisting the spin bowlers on the dry wicket. Despite Kardar's innings of 54 and 29, the top-score in both innings, Australia won by an innings and 90 runs as wickets fell steadily. The wickets were spread evenly among the tourists; Toshack took three in each innings, while Johnston and McCool totalled four for the match.|$|E
5|$|Denis Compton hit a {{cautious}} 62, but Middlesex lost wickets regularly {{to fall from}} 1/78 to 203 all out. Five bowlers shared the wickets, Johnston and Loxton taking three apiece. At one stage, Australia were 53/3, but Morris (109) and Loxton (123) put on a partnership of 172. No other batsman bettered Hamence's 30, and Jim Sims took 6/65 as the Australians collapsed and lost their last six wickets for 46. Middlesex scored 135 in their second innings, with only John Dewes (51) and Leslie Compton resisting the tourists, while eight managed only single figures. Five bowlers shared the wickets, and McCool {{was the only one}} to take three. McCool <b>and</b> <b>Ring</b> made the 22 required for victory in four overs.|$|E

5|$|During the tour, Saggers had few {{opportunities}} with the bat, generally batting between No. 8 and No. 10,N- because Australia's frontline bowlers included {{the likes of}} Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, who were all capable batsmen. Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career, while McCool scored 18 first-class centuries, one in Tests. Johnson <b>and</b> <b>Ring</b> both scored more than 20 fifties at first-class level. As a result, many of the bowlers batted before he did. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions, Saggers only had 12 innings in his 17 first-class fixtures and was not out three times after his remaining partners had been dismissed.|$|E

The Emperor of Exmoor, a red stag (Cervus elaphus), was Britain's largest known wild land animal, until it was killed in October 2010.

Birds seen on the moor include merlin, peregrine falcon, Eurasian curlew, European stonechat, dipper, Dartford warbler <b>and</b> <b>ring</b> ouzel. Black grouse and red grouse are now extinct on Exmoor, probably {{as a result of a}} reduction in habitat management, and for the former species, an increase in visitor pressure.|$|E

Little Ring Mountain at the northernmost end of the field had not been studied at the time and was not included on Souther's 1980 map. Ember Ridge at the southern end of the field was originally mapped as a cluster of five lava domes. The sixth lava dome, Ember Ridge Northeast, was discovered by Ph.D. student Melanie Kelman during a period of research in 2001.|$|E
