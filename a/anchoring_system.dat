40|$|A {{technique}} is {{developed for the}} analysis of multiple underream <b>anchor</b> <b>systems</b> resting in an elastic soil. This technique may be used to consider <b>anchor</b> <b>systems</b> involving arbitrary <b>anchor</b> inclination and depth beneath the soil surface, as well as arbitrary number, shape, size and spacing of underreams.

40|$|An {{anchorage}} {{system for}} the tensile load transmission on the circular rods/tendons made from high-strength pultruded composites is proposed. The anchorage system comprises a composite rod having a spitted end with an inserted and glued metal wedge, a metal sleeve and pottant material, connecting composite rod and sleeve. The main objective of the system proposed is reduction of high stress concentration at the loaded end, which is typical for the bond-type <b>anchor</b> <b>systems.</b> The detailed analysis of 3 D stress-strain state of the anchor was performed for pultruded CFRP/epoxy rod, steel sleeve, aluminum wedge and epoxy resin pottant. All calculations were made with finite element method accounting for elastic and elastic-plastic behavior of epoxy resin in shear. The principal conclusion resulting from these FEM calculations implies that stress concentration at the loaded end of the <b>anchor</b> <b>system</b> keeps independently of the wedge location if the adhesive bond between composite rod and pottant is available. The possible technical solution of this problem may be creation of a friction interface between composite rod and pottant within the anchorage length. To verify this suggestion, 3 D contact FEM problems for the <b>anchor</b> <b>system</b> with the various lengths of friction interface were considered and analyzed. A series of the uniaxial tensile tests were carried out for the <b>anchor</b> <b>systems</b> made with CFRP pultruded rods of 5. 5 mm diameter, steel sleeve of 300 mm length, A 1 wedge of 110 mm length and cone angle of 7 ° embedded into epoxy resin.

40|$|Abstract: With the {{development}} of supporting technology, more and more pressure-dispersive <b>anchor</b> <b>systems</b> are applied in civil and mining engineering recently. In this <b>anchor</b> <b>system,</b> unbonded steel strands are used to disperse the external load to load-bearing bodies at different locations, and the load is transferred through the compressing action between the load-bearing body and cement mortar. It has obvious technique advantage as a permanent <b>anchor</b> <b>system.</b> However, the stretching mode for pressure-dispersive grout anchor is still not clear in actual engineering practice. In this paper, there are 3 common types of stretching mode for pressure-dispersive grout anchor with u-shaped load-bearing bodies in soil ground are analyzed by FEM (finite element method) and the reasonable one is suggested.

40|$|Background: Body-powered {{prosthesis}} users frequently {{complain about}} the poor cosmesis and comfort of the traditional shoulder harness. The Ipsilateral Scapular Cutaneous <b>Anchor</b> <b>System</b> offers an alternative, but it remains unclear to what extent it affects the perception and control of cable operation forces compared to the traditional shoulder harness. Objective: To compare cable force perception and control with the figure-of-nine harness versus the Ipsilateral Scapular Cutaneous <b>Anchor</b> <b>System</b> and to investigate force perception and control at different force levels. Study design: Experimental trial. Methods: Ten male able-bodied subjects completed a cable force reproduction task at four force levels {{in the range of}} 10 – 40 N using the figure-of-nine harness and the <b>Anchor</b> <b>System.</b> Perception and control of cable operating forces were quantified by the force reproduction error and the force variability. Results: In terms of force reproduction error and force variability, the subjects did not behave differently when using the two systems. The smallest force reproduction error and force variability were found at the smallest target force level of 10 N. Conclusion: The <b>Anchor</b> <b>System</b> performs no differently than the traditional figure-of-nine harness in terms of force perception and control, making it a viable alternative.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on the behaviour of beams shearstrengthened with FRP sheets. The studies show that FRP materials can produce good performance when used to carry some portion of shear force in the shear-strengthened beam. However, the performance of FRP sheets is found limited by bond capacity between FRP sheets and concrete surface. In certain case, anchorage system can be introduced to the FRP strengthening scheme to improve the bond performance. This paper presents experimental and analytical studies conducted to evaluate the contribution and behaviour of FRP sheets with anchored ends in strengthening the shear behaviour of reinforced concrete beams. In the study, nine reinforced concrete beam specimens were fabricated and tested. Test parameters of the study include thickness of FRP sheet used, types of wrap applied, type of anchors and diameter of anchor head used. Two types of anchorage system were proposed in the study, i. e. insert <b>anchor</b> <b>system</b> and C-embedded <b>anchor</b> <b>system.</b> The results from this study show that the proposed anchorage system can improve the contribution of FRP in carrying the shear force in beams.
