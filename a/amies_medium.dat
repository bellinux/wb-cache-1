40|$|BBL ™ CultureSwab ™ Plus are sterile {{ready-to-use}} systems {{intended for}} the collection, transport and preservation of clinical specimens for bacteriological examination. SUMMARY AND PRINCIPLES One of the routine procedures in the diagnosis of bacterial infections involves the collection and safe transportation of a clinical specimen from the patient to the laboratory. This can be accomplished using the BBL CultureSwab Plus collection and transport device. Each BBL CultureSwab Plus unit is comprised of a sterile peel pouch containing a rayon-tipped swab applicator used to collect the sample and a tube containing transport medium into which the swab applicator is placed after sampling. The BBL CultureSwab Plus are available with <b>Amies</b> <b>Medium</b> Without Charcoal and <b>Amies</b> <b>Medium</b> With Charcoal. These transport media are non-nutritious, buffered with phosphate and provide a reduced environment, due to their formulation with sodium thioglycollate. 1 Organisms in the sample material are protected from drying by moisture in the transport medium. The medium is designed to maintain the viability of organisms during transit to the laboratory. Survival of fastidious bacteria such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae can be prolonged due {{to the presence of}} charcoal in <b>Amies</b> <b>Medium</b> With Charcoal. BBL CultureSwab Plus pouches are made of a plastic film which retards the penetration of atmospheric ai...|$|E

40|$|Haemophilus paragallinarum, the causative {{agent of}} {{infectious}} coryza in poultry, {{is an extremely}} fastidious organism requiring specific growth conditions for isolation. For complete control of the disease in regions where more {{that one of the}} serovars of the different serogroups occurs, it is essential that the bacterium causing the problem be isolated and serotyped. This work describes the modification and testing of transport media, which will ensure the survival of the causative agents in suspected infectious coryza cases for transport to a laboratory where the bacterium can be isolated and serotyped. The various transport media used are based on commercially available <b>Amies</b> Transport <b>Medium</b> supplemented with the different supplements used for the growth of H. paragallinarum.

40|$|Calcium {{alginate}} (CA) -tipped swabs {{have been}} reported to interfere with the recovery of herpes simplex virus, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum and may cause cytotoxicity in cell culture. To determine whether CA swabs also inhibit the growth of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, we carried out a series of experiments using either CA swabs that were toxic or nontoxic in a cell culture cytotoxicity assay or nontoxic rayon or cotton swabs. Leaving a toxic CA swab in 3 ml of Mueller-Hinton broth inoculated with 10 (4) CFU/ml caused rapid killing within 6 h at 37 degrees C; colony counts of five strains were less than 1 % of those of Mueller-Hinton broth controls. When the tips of toxic CA swabs were inoculated directly and kept at 37 degrees C without holding medium, the swabs were sterile at 6 h. If the same swabs were placed in <b>Amies</b> <b>medium</b> with charcoal, organisms could still be recovered at 6 h. Toxicity was less at room temperature than at 37 degrees C. Inhibition of growth of N. gonorrhoeae was not seen with rayon or cotton swabs. The toxic component was neither the CA fiber nor the aluminum wire but probably the glue used to attach the fibers. We concluded that some lots of CA swabs kill N. gonorrhoeae in vitro. Survival of N. gonorrhoeae is improved with nontoxic swabs, particularly cotton swabs, and <b>Amies</b> <b>medium</b> with charcoal regardless of swab type...|$|E
40|$|Footrot is an {{important}} infectious disease of small ruminants leading to severe economical losses. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine isolation and identification rates of Dichelobacter nodosus and Fusobacterium necrophorum in the culture techniques and reveal the specificity and sensitivity of the culture technique based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in sheep with footrot. Dry swabs and swabs with <b>Amies</b> <b>medium</b> from 83 sheep were subjected to PCR and culture analyses. In dry swabs, 4 samples were positive for F. necrophorum and all were negative for D. nodosus. Colonies in Eugon and Fusobacterium selective agars from swabs with <b>Amies</b> <b>medium</b> were evaluated. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was conducted on macroscopically and microscopically unidentified samples. The positivity rate was 55. 4 % for D. nodosus and 69. 8 % for F. necrophorum in cultures from Fusobacterium selective agars. The positivity rate for D. nodosus in Fusobacterium selective agars was higher than that in Eugon agar. Performing PCR and culture methods increased positivity as compared to performing them alone. In comparison with the PCR method, culturing in Fusobacterium selective agars had moderate sensitivity and low specificity for D. nodosus (71. 7 and 28. 7 %) and F. necrophorum (61. 3 and 80. 0 %), respectively. In conclusion, Fusobacterium selective agar (without antibiotics) for isolation and identification of D. nodosus is superior to Eugon agar. Fusobacterium necrophorum should also be considered as a provoking agent for footrot in small ruminants. The PCR method on culture increases elucidation of definitive aetiology...|$|E

An initial assay compared the recovery of B. bronchiseptica from swabs simultaneously inoculated with B. bronchiseptica and some interfering bacteria, immersed into three transport formulations (Amies with charcoal, trypticase soy broth and phosphate buffer according to Soerensen supplemented with 5 % of bovine fetal serum) and submitted to different temperatures (10 ºC and 27 ºC) and periods of incubation (24, 72 and 120 hours). A subsequent assay compared three selective media (MacConkey agar, modified selective medium G 20 G and a ceftiofur medium) for their recovery capabilities from clinical specimens. One last assay compared the polymerase chain reaction to the three selective media. In the first assay, the recovery of B. bronchiseptica from transport systems was better at 27 ºC and the three formulations had good performances at this temperature, but the collection of qualitative and quantitative analysis indicated the advantage of <b>Amies</b> <b>medium</b> for nasal swabs transportation.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{first step}} in routine {{microbiology}} laboratory procedures is the collection and safe transportation of swab samples. This can be accomplished using ESwab Collection and Transport System (Copan Italia, Brescia -Italy). The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare the results of microscopic examination of gram stain smears prepared directly from clinical specimens, collected and transported in the ESwab, with those obtained using Amies Agar gel Transystem without charcoal (Copan). Findings Specimens were collected from 80 patients (32 vaginal swabs, 27 cervical swabs, 11 urethral swabs and 10 wound swabs). Two swabs were in random order collected from each patient, one using the conventional Amies gel Transystem, the other using ESwab. One slide was prepared for each specimen using the conventional swab and two sets of slides were prepared from the specimens collected with the ESwab: one using 100 μl and one using 50 μl of the <b>Amies</b> <b>medium.</b> All slides were gram stained using an automated Gram stainer. Microscopic examination of 240 slides (80 with conventional and 160 with ESwab) showed that the quality of smear preparation from the ESwab system, allowed for easier identification of human cells and identification of greater number of microorganisms. Microscopic examination of additional slides prepared from ESwab at 24 or 72 hours after initial collection were equivalent to those prepared when received in the laboratory within 2 hours of collection.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Swab-based nasal {{screening}} {{is commonly}} used to identify asymptomatic carriage of Staphylococcus aureus in patients. Bacterial detection depends on the uptake and release capacities of the swabs and on the swabbing technique itself. This study investigates the performance of different swab-types in nasal MRSA-screening by utilizing a unique artificial nose model to provide realistic and standardized screening conditions. METHODS: An anatomically correct artificial nose model was inoculated with a numerically defined mixture of MRSA and Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria at quantities of 4 × 10 (2) and 8 × 10 (2) colony forming units (CFU), respectively. Five swab-types were tested following a strict protocol. Bacterial recovery was measured for direct plating and after elution into <b>Amies</b> <b>medium</b> by standard viable count techniques. RESULTS: Mean recovered bacteria quantities varied between 209 and 0 CFU for MRSA, and 365 and 0 CFU for S. epidermidis, resulting swab-type-dependent MRSA-screening-sensitivities ranged between 0 and 100 %. Swabs with nylon flocked tips or cellular foam tips performed significantly better compared to conventional rayon swabs referring to the recovered bacterial yield (p< 0. 001). Best results were obtained by using a flocked swab in combination with Amies preservation medium. Within {{the range of the}} utilized bacterial concentrations, recovery ratios for the particular swab-types were independent of the bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: This study combines a realistic model of a human nose with standardized laboratory conditions to analyze swab-performance in MRSA-screening situations. Therefore, influences by inter-individual anatomical differences as well as diverse colonization densities in patients could be excluded. Recovery rates vary significantly between different swab-types. The choice of the swab has a great impact on the laboratory result. In fact, the swab-type contributes significantly to true positive or false negative detection of nasal MRSA carriage. These findings should be considered when screening a patient...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} group B streptococcus (GBS) detection in an {{in vitro}} setting, using a low and controlled inoculum from swabs directly inoculated into a selective medium, {{as compared to}} delayed inoculation following a period in a commercial <b>Amies</b> transport <b>medium</b> with charcoal (Venturi Transystem ™ Copan, Italy). Study design: Clinical isolates of GBS (n = 103), were inoculated into the <b>Amies</b> transport <b>medium</b> with charcoal in a concentration of 100 colony-forming units (cfu) /ml (10 cfu/swab). Swabs were then transferred to an enrichment broth (NPC) at time intervals of 0, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours. Broths were then incubated for 18 – 24 hours at 35 °C in air, before being transferred to New Granada Medium Modified (NGM) for GBS detection and incubated for a further 18 – 24 hours at 35 °C in air. If the characteristic orange pigmented colonies were observed after this period, the specimen was recorded as + (1 – 10 colonies) or ++ (more than 10 colonies). Results: Overall 92. 2 % (95 / 103) of isolates were detected in all tubes and at all times. An additional two isolates were non-hemolytic, non-pigment forming GBS. Of note, 3. 9 % (4 / 103) were negative until 2 hours delayed inoculation and 1. 9 % (2 / 103) gave inconsistent results, likely due to the low inoculum used. Conclusion: Delayed inoculation into selective enrichment broth following a period in transport medium, even with a low inoculum, gave a similar and acceptable GBS detection rate to direct inoculation. Hence, <b>Amies</b> transport <b>medium</b> with charcoal is an appropriate transport medium to use, where it is not practical for clinical specimens to be directly inoculated into selective enrichment broth and as endorsed in the Center...|$|R
40|$|Femoral {{heads are}} an {{important}} source of allograft bone used in reconstructive orthopaedic surgery. The sterility of donor material is of major importance for the recipient. Femoral heads intraoperatively retrieved during hip arthroplasty from medically screened living donors are routinely checked with a surface swab to exclude microbiological contamination. There is, however, evidence that swab cultures have limited sensitivity. We therefore prospectively compared two ways of screening femoral heads. Bacterial recovery from swabs in <b>Amies</b> transport <b>medium</b> taken intraoperatively, sub sequently transported to the microbiology laboratory and inoculated on agar and in broth was compared with the recovery from a bone fragment also taken intraoperatively but immediately inoculated into Wilkins Chalgren broth. Forty femoral heads were tested with both methods. Bacteria were cultured neither from the femoral surface swabs nor from the femoral fragments. Consequently no distinct conclusions regarding the sensitivity of both techniques could be drawn.

Following storage at 4 °C, GBS detection in GA was not affected after 72 h by either direct inoculation or SBE; however, GBS were not detected after SBE in the BA subculture in some samples after 48 h of storage and in GA after 96 h. After storage at 21 °C, loss of GBS-positive results was significant after 48 h by direct inoculation in GA and after 96 h by SBE and BA subculture; some GBS-positive samples were not detected after 24 h of storage followed by SBE and BA subculture or after 48 h of storage followed by SBE and GA subculture.

40|$|Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) is an {{important}} respiratory pathogen of chickens and turkeys. Isolation of the bacterium from diseased birds is necessary for serotyping, to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility for an effective therapy and to produce autogenous vaccines. A series of experiments was carried out to determine optimal conditions for storage of swabs soaked in ORT suspension. Swabs were immersed in viable ORT suspensions with different bacterial counts and then stored under different conditions. At several time points the viable ORT count in the swabs was determined. Dry cotton swabs as well as three transport media, namely <b>Amies</b> gel <b>medium</b> (AG), <b>Amies</b> gel <b>medium</b> with charcoal (AC), and Stuart gel medium (SG) were tested. ORT could be reisolated from dry swabs stored {{at room temperature for}} up to five days and from swabs stored in the media at room temperature for more than seven days. Differences among the transport media were minor. The minimal number of cfu in the ORT-suspension, in which the swabs were soaked, was 105 cfu/ml for successful reisolation of ORT one day post immersion from swabs stored at room temperature in AC medium, and 106 cfu/ml was successful for reisolation from dry swabs. Higher inoculation doses and storage at 4 °C prolonged the period in which ORT could be reisolated.

A total of 1, 485 GT and 1, 485 AT were tested with 33 well-characterized GBS strains in three different concentrations, five different incubation times, and three different temperatures. After initial incubation at room temperature (RT) or 4 °C, GT were placed at 37 °C. GT were scored for the presence of orange pigment. GT and AT were subcultured on blood agar (BA). Pigment was observed in 98 % of GT incubated at 37 °C. GBS could be cultured in 91 %, 73 %, and 55 % of GT incubated at 37 °C, RT, or 4 °C, respectively. For AT, these percentages were only 20 % at 37 °C, 52 % at RT, and 59 % at 4 °C. When GT initially incubated at RT or 4 °C were subsequently incubated at 37 °C, the sensitivity improved significantly. We conclude that GT is a more sensitive GBS transport and culture medium than the conventional method, especially for low inocula and prolonged transport/incubation times.

All underfives with cough or difficult breathing and classified as having non-severe pneumonia (WHO guidelines), were included in the study. Nasopharyngeal swabs (CDC/WHO Manual) were obtained by the doctor, the swabs were placed in <b>Amies</b> transport <b>medium</b> and stored in a sterile jar before taken to the laboratory in the same day. All children were treated with co-trimoxazole. During the nine month study, 698 children with clinical signs of non-severe pneumonia were enrolled. About 25 % of the nasopharyngeal specimens yielded bacterial isolates; the two most frequently found were S. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis. The antimicrobial resistance test to co-trimoxazole showed 48. 2 % S. pneumoniae strain had full resistance and 32. 7 % showed intermediate resistance to co-trimoxazole. This result is almost similar to other studies from Asian countries. It seems that H. influenzae is not a problem in the study area; however, further studies are needed...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{recently}} introduced ESwab transport system incorporates a flocked nylon swab for sample collection and liquid <b>Amies</b> transport <b>medium.</b> The system potentially collects more material and releases {{a higher percentage}} of microorganisms than spun fiber swabs with agar transport media. Data for this system are currently lacking relative to anaerobes. The object {{of this study was to}} perform a quantitative evaluation of the ESwab for maintaining viability of selected clinically important anaerobic bacteria. For comparison, the BBL Port-A-Cul (PAC) agar tube transport system with polyester swabs was tested. Methods: Anaerobic bacteria selected for this ongoing study were 11 ATCC strains and 14 recent clinical isolates. Quantitative viability studies were performed in triplicate at both controlled room temperature (RT) and refrigerator temperature (4 C) at the same time. For each organism/swab device combination, viable counts were performed at zero (0) time, 24 h and 48 h according to the CLSI- 40 A quantitative elution method. Results: Initial 0 -time counts for 9 anaerobes studied thus far were nearly 1 log (base 10) higher for the ESwab than for the PAC. After swabs were held 24 h at 4 C compared to 0 -time, organism recovery from the ESwab was 76 %, vs. 32 % for the PAC (based on average CFU/ml for 9 organisms). After 48 h at 4 C, recovery from ESwab was 59 % and recovery from the PAC was 17 % compared to 0 -time. At RT compared to 0 -time, the overall recovery o...|$|R
40|$|Group B streptococci (GBS) or Streptococcus agalactiae {{are members}} of the normal flora of the female genital tract. GBS {{normally}} colonizes the vagina in many women asymptomatically. During labor this organism may infect the newborn, leading to neonatal sepsis and meningitis. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of group B streptococcus in pregnant women by a rapid and easy culture method. It seems that in cases in which GBS carriage is not suspected until the time of labor, using such a quick and specific culture method would be valuable. A total of 330 vaginal swabs were collected from women attending delivery room at Hedayat hospital, Tehran, Iran, from April through July 2008. Cotton swabs contaminated with vaginal fluid were placed into <b>Amies</b> transport <b>medium</b> and transported to the Avicenna laboratory daily. Vaginal specimens were cultured on selective GBS Agar Base medium (ISLAM) for isolation and detection of group B streptococcus. The plates were incubated at 35 - 37 &deg;C under anaerobic condition for 24 hours. Incubated S. agalactiae developed orange/red pigmented colonies in GBS agar plates. Among the 330 women, the results of the culture were positive for GBS in 68 women (20. 6 %). Statistical analyses showed no significant relationship between demographics, reproductive histories and obstetric characteristics of subjects with the test results. Solely the antibiotic therapy was associated with GBS colonization. The results are indicating that the relatively high maternal GBS colonization rate in pregnant women warrants a routine screening and prophylactic treatment of the infected women. Colonization with group B streptococcus can be identified directly by GBS agar medium and decrease the time to detection of GBS...|$|R
40|$|Protective {{transport}} {{media have}} {{to be used to}} preserve Neisseria gonorrhoeae in clinical specimens during their transit to the laboratory. In this study, a CO 2 - environment chamber, the Jembec chamber, was used for transport of clinical speciments requiring examination for gonococci. The survival of N. gonorrhoeae present in clinical speciments when placed in <b>Amies</b> charcoal transport <b>medium</b> was compared to their survival when inoculated into Jembec chambers containing either modified Thayer-Martin medium (MTM) or modified New York City transport medium (MNYC). For a period of up to 2 days in transit, the three systems were not significantly different. However, after 3 days in transit, MNYC/Jembec chambers preserved significantly more gonococci than Amies charcoal transport meduim (P less than 0. 0001) or MTM/Jembec chambers (P= 0. 006). MNYC/Jembec chambers withstood 241 miles (386 km) of postal transit during winter months; 80 % of the gonococci present in clinical specimens remained viable from 2 to 5 days under these conditions. The CO 2 generated by the tablet in the Jembec chamber was suggicient to support the growth of N. gonorrhoeae if the chambers were incubated at 36 C immediately after inoculation. However, if delayed in transit, the chambers had to be incubated in 5 to 10 % CO 2 to promote the growth of N. gonorrhoeae. MNYC/Jembec chambers provide a selective environment that will protect and maintain the viability of N. gonorrhoeae for extended periods, allowing a reasonable time for postal transit of clinical specimens to the laboratory...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Genital mycoplasmas are {{opportunistic}} {{bacteria that}} are associated with undesirable gynaecologic and reproductive events. Mycoplasmas are fastidious bacteria with increasing resistance to routine antimicrobials and often fail to grow on conventional culture methods. The commercial Mycofast Revolution assay permits the phenotypic detection and identification of genital mycoplasmas. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing against five antimicrobial agents with MICs corresponding to the CLSI guidelines can also be performed. This study aimed to compare the new commercially available Mycofast Revolution assay with a multiplex PCR assay. METHODS: Self-collected swabs were obtained from pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic of a tertiary academic hospital in Pretoria, South Africa from October 2012 to November 2012. These swabs were used to seed UMMt and modified Amies transport media. The seeded UMMt transported medium was used to inoculate the Mycofast Revolution assay for the identification, enumeration and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of genital mycoplasmas. Following DNA extraction from the modified <b>Amies</b> transport <b>medium,</b> specimens were subjected to a multiplex PCR assay for the detection of genital mycoplasmas. RESULTS: The Mycofast Revolution kit had a sensitivity and specificity of 77. 3 % (95 % CI: 62. 15 % to 88. 51 %) and 80 % (95 % CI: 28. 81 % to 96. 70 %), respectively, against the PCR assay. The positive and negative predictive values were 97. 1 % (95 % CI: 85. 03 % to 99. 52 %) and 28. 6 % (95 % CI: 8. 57 % to 58. 08 %). Genital mycoplasmas were detected in 71. 4 % (35 / 49) of samples with the Mycofast Revolution assay with 49 % (24 / 49) being Ureaplasma spp. and 22. 4 % (11 / 49) mixed strains. The multiplex PCR assay had a positivity rate of 89. 8 % (44 / 49) for genital mycoplasmas; mixed strains were present in 51 % (25 / 49) of samples, Ureaplasma spp. in 16. 3 % (8 / 49) and M. hominis in 22. 4 % (11 / 49) of samples. CONCLUSIONS: There was a fair agreement (κ = 0. 319) between the Mycofast Revolution assay and the mPCR assay. With the high prevalence rates of genital mycoplasmas, fast and efficient diagnostic methods are imperative to treat infections and minimise complications. The Mycofast Revolution assay is simple to use, has a short turnaround time and interpretation of results are straightforward. This assay circumvents common problems experienced with conventional culture and molecular methods in diagnostic laboratories where skilled personnel are limited and can be used as an alternative diagnostic assay.
