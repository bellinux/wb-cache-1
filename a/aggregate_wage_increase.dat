It shows how a model of DNWR informed by diverse evidence for worker resistance to nominal wage cuts is nevertheless consistent with weak macroeconomic effects. This occurs because firms {{have an incentive to}} compress <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> as well as wage cuts when DNWR binds. By neglecting potential compression of <b>wage</b> <b>increases,</b> the previous literature may have overstated the costs of DNWR to firms.

These results suggest that DNWR may not provide a strong argument against the targeting of low inflation rates, as practiced by many monetary authorities.

40|$|This section {{examines}} {{the sensitivity of}} results to alternative specifications of the productivity process, the matching function elasticity, {{as well as an}} alternative measure of volatility. Alternative Productivity Process In the model productivity follows an AR 1 -process, with the parameters estimated from data. This section begins by examining how large is the impact of the standard errors of these estimates for the results. Figure C. 1 shows the difference a one standard error (0. 03) increase in the AR 1 coefficient of productivity (λ ≈ 0. 89) makes for outcomes. As the figure shows, both the vacancy-unemployment ratio and the <b>aggregate</b> <b>wage</b> respond more to a shock which is expected to last longer. Under limited commitment <b>wage</b> volatility <b>increases</b> also because increased persistence makes participation constraints bind more. Figure C. 2 shows how outcomes change when the standard deviation of productivity (0. 02) is increased by 25 % and 50 %. The estimated probability that the standard deviation of the empirical productivity process is greater than this is 12 % and 3 %, respectively. 1 This leaves the regression coefficient P (θ|z) roughly unchanged, indicating that the increased volatility of the shock translates linearly to an increase in the volatility of the vacancy-unemployment ratio. The same holds also for the <b>aggregate</b> <b>wage,</b> under full commitment. With larger productivity shocks participation constraints bind more frequently, however, leading to increased cyclicality in limited-commitment <b>wages.</b> 2 The <b>increased</b> <b>wage</b> volatility from these changes in the productivity process allows th...|$|R

40|$|This article {{studies the}} effect of recent labor market reforms on {{industrial}} relations in new democracies (1994 – 2003). The literature on labor politics posits two channels through which labor market deregu-lation may relate to industrial conflict. Wage deregulation may lower <b>wage</b> costs, <b>increasing</b> industrial conflict. Employment deregulation, however, can reduce the ability of workers to act collectively. Using methods uniquely suited for panel data analysis, the study reveals {{a number of important}} findings. First, whereas labor quiescence went hand in hand with relatively modest increases in earnings in a number of established democracies, modest <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> are generally linked with more labor militancy in new democracies. Higher wage and employment regulation minimize wage reductions, lowering the inci-dence of strikes. Finally, wage regulation has the largest effect on <b>aggregate</b> <b>wages</b> and consequently on the incidence of strikes and lockouts. While democratization expands popular participation, it also increases pressures for redistribution, particularly from the working class (Nelson, 1991; Rodrik, 1999). One way governments in new democracies 1 have addressed this challenge is through the creation of institutions of national social dialogue. Over the last two decades, participation by representatives of trade union and employer associations in economic and social policy-making (Ishikawa, 2003, p. 3) has featured promi-nently in processes of democratic transition and consolidation. In many new democracies, social dialogue has assumed special importance, both in terms of its ability to maintain social cohesion and of the economic reforms which it has made possible (ILO, 1997). Tripartite institutions have been instru-mental in the reform of labor market policies and institutions in Latin America and Southern Europe (Cook, 2007, p. 11). 2 In all Central and Eastern European democracies, tripartite committees have become the mechanism through which <b>wage</b> <b>increases</b> are regulated and minimum wages set (Borisov and Clarke, 2006...|$|R
