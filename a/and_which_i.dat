25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, <b>and</b> <b>which,</b> <b>I</b> will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E

I pleaded with him to let me throw over him a large waterproof wrap which had often served him in sickness during the summer season for a dressing gown <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> hoped might so cover his person that in the grey of the morning {{he would not be}} recognized. As he strode off I threw over his head a little black shawl which was around my own shoulders, saying that he could not find his hat and after he started sent my colored woman after him with a bucket for water hoping that he would pass unobserved." ...|$|E

The first song of the soundtrack was completed in December 2011. By February 2012, Rahman {{said in an interview}} with The Times of India that he had completed three songs for the film. He summarized the soundtrack album: [...] "It's a combination. They wanted to do my kind of songs at the same time they wanted the old charm and soul of music that Indian audience would love <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do for a long time." [...] The soundtrack features nine songs, with eight lyrics by Gulzar and the title track written by Aditya Chopra. It was released by YRF Music on 9 October 2012.|$|E

500|$|In Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte, a {{biography}} by Napoleon's private secretary, Louis de Bourrienne, {{he notes that}} Le souper de Beaucaire was reprinted as a book– the first edition issued {{at the cost of}} the Public Treasury in August 1798, and a second edition in 1821, following Napoleon's death. He also states, [...] "It was during my absence from France that Bonaparte, in the rank of chef de bataillon , performed his first campaign, and contributed so materially to the recapture of Toulon. Of this period of his life I have no personal knowledge, and therefore I shall not speak of it as an eye-witness. I shall merely relate some facts which fill up the interval between 1793 and 1795, <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> have collected from papers which he himself delivered to me. Among these papers is a little production, entitled Le Souper de Beaucaire, the copies of which he bought up at considerable expense, and destroyed upon his attaining the Consulate." ...|$|E
500|$|In late August, Augusta Saint-Gaudens sent {{new models}} for the eagle to Acting Director Preston. [...] When Barber {{examined}} them, he noted, [...] "dies made from these models {{would be a great}} improvement over those already made" [...] and stated that with these models, the Mint could have the eagle in full production within a month. [...] Homer Saint-Gaudens, the sculptor's son, wrote to Preston, [...] "Mr. Hering has finally finished the eagle at a relief slightly lower than that on the French [...] coin by Chaplin, [...] which is the lowest relief that Mr. Hering knew my father would abide by, <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> understand Mr. Barber can mint." [...] In the meantime, Cortelyou ordered 500 pieces struck on the Mint's high-pressure medal press from the dies the Mint had from Saint-Gaudens's earlier efforts, thus complying with the letter of the President's August 7 order. [...] Preston sent a note to Norris, warning that the President would likely order 100pieces and suggesting that he have the coins available [...] "so you can furnish them without a moment's delay". [...] According to numismatic historian Roger Burdette, [...] "these were an 'insurance policy', put in place by Cortelyou against additional presidential rage". [...] The President viewed sample eagle coins on August 31, and expressed his satisfaction with them and his desire to see more struck.|$|E
500|$|Although no {{materials}} {{appear to}} exist specifically addressing {{the composition of}} [...] "The Princess and the Pea", Andersen does speak to {{the writing of the}} first four tales of 1835 of which [...] "The Princess on the Pea" [...] is one. New Year's Day 1835, Andersen wrote to a friend: [...] "I am now starting on some 'fairy tales for children.' I am going to win over future generations, you may want to know", and, in a letter dated February 1835 he wrote to the poet, Bernhard Severin Ingemann: [...] "I have started some 'Fairy Tales Told for Children' and believe I have succeeded. I have told a couple of tales which as a child I was happy about, <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> do not believe are known, and have written them exactly the way I would tell them to a child." [...] Andersen had finished the tales by March 1835 and told Admiral Wulff's daughter, Henriette: [...] "I have also written some fairy tales for children; Ørsted says about them that if The Improvisatore makes me famous then these will make me immortal, for they are the most perfect things I have written; but I myself do not think so." [...] On 26March, he observed that [...] " [...] will be published in April, and people will say: the work of my immortality! Of course I shan't enjoy the experience in this world." ...|$|E

500|$|Aspects of Nelson's {{life and}} career were controversial, both during his {{lifetime}} and after his death. His affair with Emma Hamilton was widely remarked upon and disapproved of, {{to the extent that}} Emma was denied permission to attend Nelson's funeral and was subsequently ignored by the government, which awarded money and titles to Nelson's legitimate family. Nelson's actions during the reoccupation of Naples have also been the subject of debate: his approval of the wave of reprisals against the Jacobins who had surrendered under the terms agreed by Cardinal Ruffo, and his personal intervention in securing the execution of Caracciolo, are considered by some biographers, such as Robert Southey, to have been a shameful breach of honour. Prominent contemporary politician Charles James Fox was among those who attacked Nelson for his actions at Naples, declaring in the House of Commons I wish that the atrocities of which we hear so much <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> abhor as much as any man, were indeed unexampled. I fear that they do not belong exclusively to the French– Naples for instance has been what is called [...] "delivered", and yet, if I am rightly informed, it has been stained and polluted by murders so ferocious, and by cruelties of every kind so abhorrent, that the heart shudders at the recital... demanded that a British officer should be brought forward, and to him they capitulated. They made terms with him under the sanction of the British name. Before they sailed their property was confiscated, numbers were thrown into dungeons, and some of them, I understand, notwithstanding the British guarantee, were actually executed. Other pro-republican writers produced books and pamphlets decrying the events in Naples as atrocities. Later assessments, including one by Andrew Lambert, have stressed that the armistice had not been authorised by the King of Naples, and that the retribution meted out by the Neapolitans was not unusual for the time. Lambert also suggests that Nelson in fact acted {{to put an end to}} the bloodshed, using his ships and men to restore order in the city.|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} Ingres's {{painting}} led in 1826 {{to a major}} new commission, The Apotheosis of Homer, a giant canvas which celebrated all the great artists of history, intended to decorate the ceiling {{of one of the}} halls of the Museum Charles X at the Louvre. Ingres was unable to finish the work in time for the 1827 Salon, but displayed the painting in grisaille. The 1827 Salon became a confrontation between the neoclassicism of Ingres's Apotheosis and a new manifesto of romanticism by Delacroix, The Death of Sardanapalus. Ingres joined the battle with enthusiasm; he called Delacroix [...] "the apostle of ugliness" [...] and told friends that he recognized [...] "the talent, the honorable character and distinguished spirit" [...] of Delacroix, but that [...] "he has tendencies which I believe are dangerous <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> must push back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cézanne, {{progressively}} {{leading up}} to 1906, moved away from classic pictorial arrangements, single view perspectives, and outlines that enclosed color. His attempt was {{to arrive at a}} [...] "lived perspective" [...] by capturing all the complexities that could be observed with the eye and captured by the senses, where both [...] "sight" [...] and [...] "touch" [...] became one. Cèzanne believed his paintings could capture a moment in time, that once passed it was gone, that art and nature are the same. Cèzanne claimed: [...] "Art is a personal apperception, which I embody in sensations <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> ask the understanding to organize into a painting." [...] The true meaning of painting grew closer as the distance from tradition increased. Just as the Cubists he would inspire, Cèzanne had little interest in the rational naturalistic painting and classical geometrical perspective inherited from the Renaissance. [...] "Nor was he satisfied," [...] writes Merleau-Ponty, [...] "with the attempts of the Impressionists to dissolve this objective order into its original elements of light and atmosphere".|$|E
