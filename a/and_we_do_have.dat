This season {{of the program was}} announced on September 10, 2009, five days before the season finale of Big Brother 11. Casting for the program began during the final week of Big Brother 11 with potential applicants submitting video tape submissions that were due by April 23, 2010. Open auditions began on March 27, 2010 in Los Angeles, California and continued across the nation in various cities including Chicago, Illinois; Washington, D.C.; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Columbus, Ohio. Applicants chosen to be a finalist went to Los Angeles, California, from which forty finalists were chosen. CBS warned people of unofficial casting companies charging a fee to audition for the show while casting ended on May 20, 2010. Executive producer Allison Grodner later stated [...] "We're excited for the summer. ... We're excited for a brand new cast of terrific competitors. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> that.

Eight years have passed since our previous survey of the field in question. 1 That was the period of great events in our life, change of the outlook, revaluation of many results, the arising of new difficulties in the development of science.

40|$|Given the {{prevalence}} {{of violence in the}} news and in popular culture, it is not surprising to see incidents of violence at school. Through the hard work of staff and parents, I believe that O’Keeffe Middle School transmits the message, “It’s not okay here. ” For the most part students buy into that message, so O’Keeffe seems to be a safe place for most students. But we do see confrontational interactions that can lead to violence <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> occasional fights and abusive, bullying behavior. Who fights? During the fall semester of the current school year (2001 - 2002), twenty-six O’Keeffe students were suspended for aggressive behavior. This represents 6 % of the student population. Eighteen boys (9 % of all boys) and eight girls (3. 5 % of all girls) were suspended. Five White boys (4 % of all White boys), twelve Black boys (27 % of all Black boys), and one Latino boy (7 % of all Latino boys) were suspended. One White girl (0. 7 % of all White girls) and seven Black girls (10. 5 % of all Black girls) were suspended. If we operate from the assumption that suspensions for fighting are doled out without bias, we can surmise that Black students are getting into a disproportionate number of aggressive incidents, in particular Black male students. Rather than make suppositions, I want to propose that we study the effects of bringing up the achievement of Black male students. The project that I will be describing is a building block in a long-term effort to raise the academic performance of this group. The project is not exclusive to this racial group – it is inclusive of boys who show a profile of high risk for academic failure, a group within which Blacks are over-represented. My primary concern is that students from all backgrounds find at O’Keeffe the mechanism to reach for and to achieve academic success. My belief is that with success come validation, opportunity, and hopefulness, all of which contribute to the diminishing of aggressive behavior...|$|E
40|$|Some Nest Box Observations. The {{following}} are some observations on nests of species who use bluebird boxes in the Gering area. Anyone else working on a bluebird project {{who would like to}} add their observations in a future NBR is invited to do so. Bluebirds make a nest that consists primarily of grasses. There are seldom any feathers. Well-used ones are plastered with droppings, although I suppose the droppings could also come if they use the box for roosting in bad weather. As far as I know {{there is no way to}} tell the difference between Mountain and Eastern Bluebird nests, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> both species here-could even have hybrids, I suppose. Chickadees have the neatest nest that is rather flat but very soft, made of a lot of mosses and animal fur and hair. Again, seldom a feather. Then there is the House Wren. From what I have read, the male arrives first and fills available holes full of sticks. Then the female arrives and picks the site she wants. She may build the actual nest on top of the sticks, or she may take all of the sticks out and start over again-even using the same sticks. So we find a lot oj houses with what I call 2 ̆ 7 dummy nests 2 ̆ 7 that are just a bunch of sticks. Sometimes the whole house is full and some of the sticks are surprisingly large-you wonder how the bird can manage to get the stick into the right position to get it into the hole. The actual nests can be quite lovely things made of hair and grasses and many times containing feathers. The feathers aren 2 ̆ 7 t usually wren feathers, many I have found appear to be small turkey feathers, but I could be wrong in that. It is always fun to see what is in the houses. Once in a while we find a wren nest built on top 01 a bluebird nest, and we have found a bluebird nest built on top of another bluebird nest.

I had {{my second}} hour of {{formation}} flying today. That’s a lot of fun, but it’s tricky;—you don’t realize how fast you’re moving in this ship until you’re about ten feet from another plane. You’ve got to {{keep your eye on}} the lead man all the time, and by the end of the period everyone gets pretty sick of that so it ends up in a rat race. The lead man peels off and we all follow him about fifty feet behind. It’s like follow the leader. You try to stay on the tail of the ship in front of you and shake the guy behind you. It’s a lot of fun and good training for combat. Gosh, hon, how these days are dragging along. They say time waits for no one, but it sure is markin’ time for this chicken, I love you and miss you so much. No, I haven’t told anyone about us yet, well only Steve and Tom. Steve wondered what had caused the sudden change. I explained to him, however. No, Tom didn’t give in this week, but he’s getting weaker and weaker. He’s paying the kid brother to stick around. I like that,—I didn’t have much to say about getting married. I asked you, didn’t I? You told me about having a double ring ceremony in the Commodor [sic] Sunday, hon. It sounds swell to me. If you hadn’t suggested it, I was going to. But listen hon, you plan this wedding as you like. I’ve always thought a wedding means much more to the girl than it does to the boy. I know this means very much to you, darling. No, angel, it doesn’t seem real does it? I still can’t believe it. There is one thing I am sure of, however, that is—I love you, always. There’s not the slightest bit of doubt in my mind darling. I know what I’m doing, and I know we’re not making a mistake. I don’t think I’ll be flying next weekend. We’re caught up on time again now, and we have until the 20 th to get twelve hours in. I’d like to go out to dinner somewhere, that way the evening won’t seem too short, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> a lot to talk about.
