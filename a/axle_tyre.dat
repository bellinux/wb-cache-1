40|$|After the {{implementation}} of the AASHTO Road Test many researches have been carried out regarding material and pavement performance, both in laboratory and in situ. Many methods for pavement evaluation and design were obtained based on empirical or empirical-mechanistic approaches.

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{result of}} the AASHO-Road-Test is {{the rule of the}} fourth power. This research project attempts to determine a theoretical way that road damage progression is caused by a given traffic load impact by heavy vehicles. This requires data on the cumulative traffic load impact and the time variant strengh of bituminous and cement concrete, as well as the calculation of the roadway covering use which is relevant for the long term serviceability and the calculation of the damage progression. Axle load measurements were made at 124 locations by the Bundesanstalt fuer Strassenwesen and were classified into seven load classes. First, these measurements have been analyzed based on records of <b>axle</b> and <b>tyre</b> configurations and are then valued by the rule of the 1. to the 6. power. Beside the method that is based on the Gaussian normal distribution for the determination of the cumulative axle load distribution, two further proceedings were used. Furthermore, for a selected number of locations and pavement constructions the time dependent damage progressions caused by the actual existing heavy load traffic is calculated by two different methods. To do this one must determine the transverse stress {{at the bottom of the}} bituminous layers or cement pavements that is critical for the long term performance. This transverse stress is taken as a basis for further probabilistic studies. To take into account the mean variation of the transverse stress caused by the variation of slab thickness and of subbase stiffness, and by the dynamic axle-loading and the effects of <b>axle</b> and <b>tyre</b> configuration, a variation coefficient of 20 % for asphalt bitumen layers and a variation coefficient of 30 % to 35 % for concrete pavements, which were the result of former research projects, are used. For determining the resistance the known time variant strength of bituminous and cement concrete and a variation coefficient of 10 % form the basis of the calculation of the damage progressions. For the first method, the design axle load of 10 tons and the affiliated load cycles calculated with the 1. to the 6. power are used for the calculation of the time variant probability of failure. Within the second method, the real number of axles and the equivalent standard axle load determinated with the 1. to the 6. power are appropriated for the calculation. By equating the results, a statement concerning the power, which is relevant for the damage progression, can be made. The data collected at a wealth of selected and heavy used road segments shows that the axle loads have to be valuated by the 3. to the 4. power in case of bituminous layers and by the 3. to the 5. power in case of cement pavements. This confirms the results of the AASHO-Road-Test. (orig.)

40|$|The {{design of}} the landing gear {{is one of the}} prime aspects of {{aircraft}} design. Literature describes the design process thoroughly, however the integration of these design methods within an automated design framework has had little focus in literature. Landing gear design includes different engineering disciplines including structures, weights, kinematics, economics and runway design. Interaction between these different disciplines makes the landing gear a complex system. Automating the design process has shown to have the advantage of increased productivity, better support for design decisions and can provide the capability of collaborative and distributed design. The automation tools improve performance of current designs and simplify the development of new aircraft configurations. In this thesis a systematic and automated landing gear design procedure is proposed. Positioning the landing gear on the aircraft is limited by several requirements. Requirements include take-off stability, touchdown stability, wing-tip and engine clearance, ground handling and stability while taxiing. Evaluation of all these limits results in a feasible design space from which the shortest possible landing gear is found. From the resulting landing gear position, loads on the landing gear struts are calculated. Tyres and wheels are selected and brakes and shock absorbers are designed. The assembly of landing gear components can then be used to make an analytical weight estimation. This analytical weight estimation is based on maximum stresses occurring within the structure due to extreme load cases prescribed in certification specifications. Preventing yielding and buckling within the structure then results in required component thicknesses. A multi-body model is then made, where structural parts are seen as rigid bodies. The multi-body model evaluates and visualises the system dynamics. The oleo-pneumatic shock absorber forces and motion are modelled using an analytical relation. An empirical tyre model models tyre motion and forces at the contact point. These two models can accurately describe forces within the tyres and shocks due to externally applied forces, which then allows for the evaluation of extreme landing load cases. This is done to verify empirically estimated dynamic landing loads used in the weight estimation. And this is done to identify loading peaks that could occur during a landing. In addition to the landing simulation a simulation of the landing gear retraction mechanism is done to check the kinematic feasibility and compliance to certification requirements. Verification of results of the implemented landing gear with reference aircraft shows that landing gear positions closely match with actual landing gear positions. The analytical weight estimation of the landing gear assembly estimates the total gear weight with an error of 15 percent. This is comparable to the result of an empirical weight estimation that has an error of 17 percent. Multi-body simulation results show that dynamic loads during an extreme landing are similar to empirically estimated dynamic loads. For landing gears with multiple rows of tyres it is especially important to look at landing loads, since a hard landing then creates peaks at high frequency in the shock loads. These peaks originate from the interaction between front and rear <b>axle</b> <b>tyres</b> hitting the ground at different times. A kinematic simulation of retraction and extension then verifies the kinematic feasibility. This simulation also shows that the retraction and locking mechanisms work and that it can be stowed within the available space. The resulting landing gear design and analysis tools complete the existing aircraft design tools, which then forms the basis for the future improvement of automated transport aircraft design.

40|$|The Metrobus {{is part of}} {{the recent}} public {{transport}} strategy of Padova. It is based on an innovative design developed by the Lohr Group, specialist in the design and creation of passenger and goods transport systems. The Metrobus is a new generation of light urban tramways, where the <b>axle</b> on pneumatic <b>tyres</b> replaces the railway boogie. The guiding of the bus is provided by a roller “V” system linked to a single guide rail which is level with the roadway, thus assuring accuracy of the route whilst avoiding wear and noise, avoiding also weighing on the rail, and mechanically impossible to derail. The uniqueness of the solution of Padova’s Metrobus in connection with the common Lohr design, is the material which is used to embed the guide rail: a polyurethane resin matrix and inert black rubber composite. This paper deals with the assessment of the safety of such embedded guide rail structure design, with respect to loads induced by the Metrobus itself and by the traffic as well as related to environmental conditions and ageing factors. The mechanical properties of the system are first determined by solving an identification-type reverse engineering problem on the available data coming from laboratory and in site tests.

40|$|New Zealand has a {{tradition}} of building granular pavements surfaced with chipseals. This form of construction is used on most rural roads and can perform well under traffic volumes of over 10, 000 vehicles/lane/day. Because of New Zealand mountainous topography many highways have very narrow shoulders. Due to this lack of lateral support and the intrusion of heavy axle loads onto the edge of pavement, edge failure has been encountered on many of these roads. This has more recently been exacerbated by the growth in forestry which has seen large truck and trailer units transporting logs out of the forests. The main objective of the research work reported here is to investigate how the pavement shoulder properties and load parameters affect this type of distress. A three dimensional finite elements model and a half fractional factorial experimental design were made to study five factors, viz., shoulder width, shoulder stiffness, <b>axle</b> load, <b>tyre</b> pressure and pavement thickness. Each factor was studied at two levels to simulate extremely low and high conditions. The results of the finite elements model have been validated to ensure accurate predictions. The multilayer elastic solution was carried out using Circly and Everstress software. Linear and nonlinear analyses using isotropic and crossanisotropic material properties were compared to the actual strain measurements carried out at Transit New Zealand accelerated test track facility (CAPTIF). None of the analytical solutions perfectly matched the measured strains. In addition, the results of the multilayer and finite elements analyses were compared together at different locations and depths from loaded area. The multilayer and three dimensional finite elements solutions were reasonably close for stresses, strains and deflections. Only very slight differences were observed for stresses and strains near the surface because of the difference between the circular and rectangular shape of loading areas in the mulilayer and finite elements analyses. The statistical experimental factorial analysis showed that the order of importance of the different factors affecting pavement response relies on the type of response and the location of that response. Three pavement responses were studied, maximum deflection between dual tyres, maximum deflection under the outer wheel load, and compressive stain {{at the top of the}} subgrade near the shoulder (300 mm from the centre of the dual). The axle load was the most significant factor affecting the deflection and strain at all locations. The interaction of shoulder stiffness, width and thickness has been shown to significantly affect the pavement response. It is proposed that the results of this research can be used by pavement designers to obtain an indication of the effect of lack of shoulder support on pavement performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} Soil Framework Directive COM(2006) 232 requires Member States {{to identify}} areas {{at risk of}} erosion, decline in organic matter, salinisation, compaction, sealing and landslides, {{as well as to}} set up an inventory of contaminated sites. The present project aims to identify the susceptibility to compaction of soils of the Walloon Region (Belgium) and to recommend good farming practices avoiding soil compaction as far as possible. Within this scope, the concept of precompression stress (Pc) (Horn and Fleige, 2003) was used. Pc is defined as the maximum major principal stress that a soil horizon can withstand against any applied external vertical stress. If applied stress is higher than Pc, the soil enters in a plastic state, not easily reversible. For a given soil, the intensity of soil compaction is mainly due to the applied load which depends on vehicle characteristics (<b>axle</b> load, <b>tyre</b> dimensions, tyre inflation pressure, and vehicle velocity). To determine soil precompression stress, pedotransfert functions of Lebert and Horn (1991) defined at two water suctions (pF 1. 8 and 2. 5) were used. Parameters required by these functions were found within several databases (Aardewerk and Digital Map of Walloon Soils) and literature. The validation of Pc was performed by measuring stress-strain relationships using automatic oedometers. Stresses of 15. 6, 31, 3, 62. 5, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 kPa were applied for 10 min each. In this study, the compaction due to beet harvesters was considered because the axle load can exceed 10 tons and these machines are often used during wet conditions. The compaction at two depth levels was considered: 30 and 50 cm. Compaction of topsoil was not taken into account because, under conventional tillage, the plough depth is lower than 25 cm. Before and after the passage of the machines, following measurements were performed: granulometry, density, soil moisture, pF curve, Atterberg limits, [...] . The software Soilflex (Keller et al., 2007) was used to estimate the distribution of the vertical stresses sigma z in the soil. Comparison was performed between sigma z and Pc. The following data simulated the passage of a beet harvester machine (mass: 23 580 kg; load: 18 000 kg) in a silty soil located in Hesbaye and classified as Aba (Sirjacobs et al., 2000). The passage of the machine would create a Pc of around 100 kPa at 30 cm depth, while the stress induced by the machine would reach 240 kPa. In the field borders, where more vehicle traffic was usually observed and where the soil was over consolidated, Pc would reach 180 kPa, while sigma z would be 220 kPa. In both cases, the risk of compaction created by the passage of the machine would be high...|$|R
40|$|Buses in Sweden {{have a low}} {{accident}} risk. However, {{statistics from}} 1996 - 2002 indicate {{that the number of}} bus accidents in Sweden with personal injuries have been increasing by 4 % yearly. Buses also have a higher percentage of accidents that occur on ice/snow covered roads than other vehicles. In Sweden passenger cars must be equipped with winter tyres during the winter period. There is no such regulation for heavy vehicles, and many buses are using summer tyres all around the year. The present project had the purpose of looking at the bus-winter problem in more detail, with the main focus on tyres. Four different studies were carried out: tyre tests, focus group discussions, driving simulator tests and an accident study. Here is given a short summary concerning methods and conclusions of each sub project. Tyre tests on smooth ice did not show any significant difference between summer tyres and non-studded winter tyres, while studded tyres exhibits a better ice grip than non-studded tyres. Nor did driving simulator tests with driving on ice covered road under the influence of heavy wind from the side show a difference between summer tyres and non-studded winter tyres. Also in these tests studded tyres were superior to non-studded. Accident statistics indicate that buses with summer tyres on the steering <b>axle</b> and winter <b>tyres</b> on the drive axle have the lowest estimated accident risk, which is in accordance with the results in a previous study. The results are however not statistically significant due the low number of accidents. Three focus groups were carried out and the importance of the tyres for traffic safety during winter was discussed. It is however hard from the gathered discussion material to estimate just how important the tyres really are. The results do not warrant a winter tyre regulation for heavy vehicles, and a restriction of the use of studded tyres for buses would probably have negative consequences on traffic safety...|$|R

One of these underwent tests at CRA-ING. Since its purpose is to reduce the level of vibration transmitted to the driver, their measurements in different points of the tractor and in different operating conditions, were compared in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the device, expressed as time of exposure. The suspension system of the front axle is designed to absorb the oscillations (especially pitching) determined by irregularities in the road surface, allowing an increased control of the vehicle at high speed, as demonstrated by the test results and confirmed by the driving impressions outlined by the operator. The action of the device under these conditions results in an increase of the exposure time, important fact because of the relevance of the road transfer operations of tractors with mounted implements or trailers to tow and of the tendency to increase the speed limit for the road tractors (in Germany were brought to 50 km h– 1 for several years). The action just described is less evident with increasing irregularity of the road surface and with the decrease of the travel speed. Nevertheless, in such conditions, the device appears to positively work along the other directions, in particular in the Z-axis, improving the action of the suspension of the driver seat...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that buses are overrepresented at {{accidents}} during winter road conditions compared to other vehicle types. Hence, the traffic safety of buses during the wintertime has been studied in more detail. The study comprised the following parts: - Gripping power studies on ice in VTI's tyre test facility. - Accident study and a survey of the use of tyre. - Focus group to gain knowledge about dangerous situations. - Driving simulator study to test the importance of the tyres during problematic situations. Tests in VTI's tyre test facility on smooth ice did not show any significant difference between summer tyres and non-studded winter tyres, while studded tyres exhibit a better ice grip than non-studded tyres. Nor did driving simulator tests when driving on ice covered road under the influence of heavy wind from the side show a difference between summer tyres and non-studded winter tyres. Also in these tests the studded tyres were superior to the non-studded. If studded tyres are used only on one axle, the driving simulator study showed that during side wind the ability to steer is important. The accident study showed that the buses that have summer tyres on the steering <b>axle</b> and winter <b>tyres</b> on the drivé axle has the lowest estimated accident risk, although it is not statistically significant. The buses equipped with studded <b>tyres</b> on both <b>axles</b> could not be statistically analysed since only 2 accidents occurred on bare roadways, and none on icy/snowy roadways, {{while at the same time}} the buses in this category drive a lot on icy/snowy roadways. This probably makes these buses the safest on winter roadways. From the focus groups it was clear that the time table has a great influence on the creating of stress and the demands on the drivers to keep the speed even during slippery roadways. Many bus drivers experience large problems with bad snow clearance, or other winter maintenance. At the same time there is a large consciousness among the drivers that it is always their own way of handling the vehicle that is the determining factor for traffic safety. The drivers were expressing a lack of further education and practical exercises with buses on slippery roads...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with producing a simple method to design low volume roads (LVR) {{by means of a}} rationale which accounts for permanent deformation development in granular layers. Rutting is regarded as the main distress mode in unsealed and thinly sealed pavements. Hence, it is desirable that it be analytically approached rather than empirically, as in most design methods. The overall aim of this PhD thesis was to look into the behaviour of in-service roads and from a newly developed process, to advance, in a systematic manner, the elements required to produce a simple mechanistic design procedure. The study took as its basis an assessment of the proximity of the stress distribution in the pavement to the material’s failure envelope. After a literature review on unbound granular materials mechanical behaviour and on low volume roads pavement design methods, Chapters 4 and 5 discuss full scale trials carried out in Scotland on typical forest roads. The overall goal of the trials carried out within the Roads Under Timber Transport project was to establish the effect of weather and seasonal effects on the rutting of forest roads and to improve their performance while enabling the roads to be economically constructed and maintained. It appears that most of the rutting occurring in the sites surveyed came shortly after their construction/resurfacing, leading to the assumption that workmanship may be a highly important variable. Lack of compaction of the layer {{could be one of the}} likely reasons for the high initial rutting rates. Establishing the effect of weather on rutting further to the existing knowledge was, however, difficult to achieve; this was mainly due to the difficulties faced in monitoring traffic conditions. A newly developed method was needed to quantify permanent deformation development due to wandering traffic on a non-level pavement; this was achieved by the use of wheel path areas, and seemed to be a way forward in the analysis of rutting in unsealed roads. Accelerated pavement trials are reported that aimed to evaluate the performance of aggregate under soaked conditions and the relative pavement deformation caused by different timber haulage vehicles. A road segment simulating a standard forest road section was constructed in a purpose-built facility located at the Ringour Quarry facility. Ten different trials were carried out combining three different aggregate materials and five types of vehicles. <b>Tyre</b> fitment, <b>axle</b> configuration and <b>tyre</b> pressure were assessed and demonstrated to play an important role on the study of rutting development. Conclusions drawn from the results suggest that management of the tyre inflation pressure and axle overload may be one of the most economic means of managing pavement deterioration in the forest road network. A mechanistic analysis of a variety of unsealed pavements was carried out in Chapter 6; and the newly proposed methodology is described in Chapter 7. With changing loading conditions – e. g. as a consequence of the introduction of Tyre Pressure Control Systems and super single tyres – more detailed analyses are required, so that their effect can be analytically assessed. Then an analytical method is introduced for evaluating the stress-strain condition in thinly surfaced or unsurfaced pavements as typically used in LVR structures. It aims to improve the understanding of the effect of tyre pressure and contact area in regard to permanent deformation. To achieve this, several scenarios were modelled using Kenlayer software varying aggregate material, thickness, stiffness, tyre pressure & arrangement. The results usually show a fairly well defined locus of maximum stresses. By comparing this stress envelope with failure envelope, conclusions could be established about the more damaging effect of super singles over twin tyres and, likewise, the greater damage inflicted by high tyre pressures compared to that incurred by lower tyre pressures. Finally, the framework of the proposed method contributes to LVR pavement design procedures mainly due to its simplicity. It still treats the pavement analytically, permitting a more fundamental description of the behaviour of granular layers than in simple linear elastic analysis, but by simplifying the elasto-plastic analysis for routine use it thereby reduces demands of material characterization and computational skills, thus increasing its utility in practical application.
