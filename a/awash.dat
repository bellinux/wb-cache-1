Similar campaigns in the north against the Agaw and the Falasha were not as successful.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Miocene, around 10 Mya, the bovids rapidly diversified, {{leading to the}} {{creation}} of 70 new genera. This late Miocene radiation was partly because many bovids became adapted to more open, grassland habitats. The Aepycerotinae first appeared in the late Miocene, and {{no significant difference in the}} sizes of the primitive and modern impala has been noted. Fossils of obivines, a tribe of Caprinae, in Africa date back to the late Miocene. The earliest Hippotragine fossils date back to the late Miocene, and were excavated from sites such as Lothagam and <b>Awash</b> Valley. The first African fossils of Reduncinae date back to 6-7 Mya. Reduncinae and Peleinae probably diverged in the mid-Miocene.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 16 August, both Montanan and West Bridge were still afloat, albeit with decks <b>awash.</b> Despite {{attempts}} to get Montanan under tow, she foundered later in the morning. Meanwhile, Hawkins and his executive officer were taken by boat to West Bridge to assess her situation. After boarding the ship and finding three cargo holds and her engineering spaces completely flooded, Hawkins advised Burrows captain that the situation was hopeless and he would only be endangering his ship, crew, and the West Bridge survivors by remaining alongside. Consequently, Burrows departed for Brest, France, leaving destroyer Smith to stand by West Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Experience with {{previous}} battlecruiser designs {{led to the}} adoption of a continuous upper deck, which raised the level of the deck aft. This was necessary because the aft decks of earlier designs were usually <b>awash</b> when steaming at high speed, even in calm seas. The ships were also equipped with a bulbous bow to reduce drag on the hull, the first time the feature was used in the German Navy. The ships as designed required a crew of 46 officers and 1,140 enlisted sailors. Service as a squadron flagship would increase that number by an additional 14 officers and 62 sailors. The vessels carried a number of small boats, including two picket boats, one barge, two launches, two cutters, and three yawls.|$|E
5|$|Hood was {{initially}} fitted with flying-off platforms mounted {{on top of}} 'B' and 'X' turrets, from which Fairey Flycatchers could launch. During her 1929â€“31 refit, the platform was removed from 'X' turret and a trainable, folding catapult was installed on her quarterdeck, along with a crane to recover a seaplane. She embarked a Fairey IIIF from No. 444 Flight of the Royal Air Force. During the 1932 West Indies cruise, the catapult proved {{to be difficult to}} operate in anything but a calm sea, as it was frequently <b>awash</b> in bad weather. The catapult and crane were removed in 1932, along with the flying-off platform on 'B' turret.|$|E
5|$|In the Book of Kells, the Chi Rho {{monogram}} {{has grown}} to consume the entire page. The letter chi dominates the page with one arm swooping across {{the majority of the}} page. The letter rho is snuggled underneath the arms of the chi. Both letters are divided into compartments which are lavishly decorated with knot work and other patterns. The background is likewise <b>awash</b> in a mass of swirling and knotted decoration. Within this mass of decoration are hidden animals and insects. Three angels arise from one of the cross arms of the chi. This miniature is the largest and most lavish extant Chi Rho monogram in any Insular Gospel Books and is the culmination of a tradition that started with the Book of Durrow.|$|E
5|$|Swayne's {{hartebeest}} {{is listed}} as Endangered, and is close to being Critically Endangered. The total population in 2008 was less than 600, of which the mature specimens numbered within 250. It is confined to four major protected areas: the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary, Nechisar National Park, <b>Awash</b> National Park and Mazie National Park. The hartebeest in Senkele {{have to compete with}} the livestock of the Oromo people. A study in the Nechisar National Park during 2009 and 2010 found a considerable increase in the livestock of the Oromos (49.9% and 56.5% increase during 2006 and 2010, respectively), illegal resource exploitation, and habitat loss as major threats to the Swayne's hartebeest populations there.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} {{is native to}} Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, but it is extinct in Djibouti. Largely {{confined}} to the Horn of Africa today, the species historically ranged from <b>Awash</b> (Ethiopia) southward through southern and eastern Ethiopia, and most parts of Somalia (except {{the north and the}} northeast) and Kenya (except the southwest). It also occurred in southeastern Sudan and northeastern and eastern parts of Uganda and Tanzania. The only evidence for its existence in the Arabian peninsula is a single set of horns obtained in 1967 from an individual shot in South Yemen and another in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the MSA are {{characterized}} in most regions by the Acheulian to MSA transition. This transition {{is considered to be}} a gradual process, rather than a singular event wherein hominin technologies advanced rapidly. Although the dates for this transition vary widely, the oldest reliably dated MSA site is Gademotta in Ethiopia at greater than 276 thousand years ago. The Middle <b>Awash</b> valley of Ethiopia and the Central Rift Valley of Kenya constituted a major center for behavioural innovation. It is likely that the large terrestrial mammal biomass of these regions supported substantial human populations with subsistence and manufacturing patterns similar to those of ethnographically known foragers.|$|E
5|$|After {{suffering}} from a prolonged respiratory infection, Mandela died on 5 December 2013 {{at the age of}} 95, at around 20:50 local time (UTC+2) at his home in Houghton, surrounded by his family. Zuma publicly announced his death on television, proclaiming ten days of national mourning, a memorial service held at Johannesburg's FNB Stadium on 10 December 2013, and 8 December as a national day of prayer and reflection. Mandela's body lay in state from 11 to 13 December at the Union Buildings in Pretoria and a state funeral was held on 15 December in Qunu. Approximately 90 representatives of foreign states travelled to South Africa to attend memorial events. The media was <b>awash</b> with tributes and reminiscences, while images of and tributes to Mandela proliferated across social media. His $4.1 million estate was left to his widow, other family members, staff, and educational institutions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his sudden death in 1940, Scott {{believed}} himself a failure, and Zelda's death in 1948 was little noted. However, interest in the Fitzgeralds surged in the years following their deaths. In 1950, screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who knew the couple from his Hollywood years, wrote The Disenchanted, with characters based recognizably on the Fitzgeralds who end up as forgotten former celebrities, he <b>awash</b> with alcohol and she befuddled by mental illness. It was followed in 1951 by Cornell University professor Arthur Mizener's The Far Side of Paradise, a biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald that rekindled interest in the couple among scholars. Mizener's biography was serialized in The Atlantic Monthly, and a story about the book appeared in Life magazine, then one of America's most widely read and discussed periodicals. Scott was viewed as a fascinating failure; Zelda's mental health was largely blamed for his lost potential.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his work}} on the Smithsonian, but before the Scott Building {{finished}} construction, Alexander traveled to New England, where he was assigned to a project at the entrance of Boston harbor. That project, the rebuilding of Minot's Ledge Lighthouse, was widely considered {{to be one of the}} most difficult to be attempted by the U.S. Government up to that time. Designed by Brigadier General Joseph Totten, head of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the lighthouse was intended to replace a structure that had been destroyed in an 1851 storm. With multiple ships wrecking on the ledge annually, the need for a lighthouse was crucial. Appointed superintendent of the lighthouse construction in April 1855, newly promoted Captain Alexander modified Totten's design in accordance with conditions at the site. Because the site of the lighthouse was continually <b>awash,</b> except at low tide and calm seas, the work of preparing the interlocking granite blocks and iron framework of the lighthouse was done at nearby Government Island, adjacent to Cohasset, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The four British ships fired {{more than}} 2,800 shells at Bismarck, and scored more than 400 hits, but {{were unable to}} sink Bismarck by gunfire. At around 10:20, running low on fuel, Tovey ordered the cruiser Dorsetshire to sink Bismarck with torpedoes and sent his battleships back to port. Dorsetshire fired a pair of torpedoes into Bismarcks {{starboard}} side, one of which hit. Dorsetshire then moved around to her port side and fired another torpedo, which also hit. By the time these torpedo attacks took place, the ship was already listing so badly that the deck was partly <b>awash.</b> It appears that the final torpedo may have detonated against Bismarcks port side superstructure, which was by then already underwater. Around 10:35, Bismarck capsized to port and slowly sank by the stern, disappearing from the surface at 10:40. Some survivors reported they saw Captain Lindemann standing at attention at the stem of the ship as she sank.|$|E
5|$|The {{sale of the}} Olympic brand {{has been}} controversial. The {{argument}} is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialised sporting spectacle. Specific criticism was levelled at the IOC for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games. The cities were <b>awash</b> in corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic-related wares. The IOC {{indicated that they would}} address this to prevent spectacles of over-marketing at future Games. Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income. Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments. Research has shown that trade is around 30 percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Navarins actions during the Battle of Tsushima on 27â€“28 May as {{there were very few}} {{survivors}} from the ship and visibility was poor for most of the battle. The ship was apparently not heavily engaged during {{the early part of the}} battle, but was badly damaged later in the day when she was third from last in the Russian line of battle. She was hit four times by large-caliber shells on the waterline that caused major flooding aft. Her quarterdeck was <b>awash</b> up to her rear 12-inch turret by 2100 and the ship was forced to stop for repairs. Around that time she was attacked by Japanese torpedo boats that may have made one or two torpedo hits. Navarin managed to get underway again and damaged one torpedo boat badly enough that she sank later that night. Around 0200 on 28 May, the ship was attacked again by the Fourth Destroyer Division which dropped six strings of mines ahead of her. These consisted of four mines linked together with cables so that hitting any part of the string would draw the mines onto the ship. Two of these mines struck Navarin, which quickly capsized and sank. Some 70 men were able to abandon ship before she sank, but only three were alive when they were found 16 hours later. One man was rescued by a Japanese torpedo boat while the other two were rescued by a British merchant ship. The rest of her crew of 674 officers and enlisted men were lost. The rescued men had said that when they called out for help, they were fired on by Japanese torpedo boats.|$|E
25|$|At <b>Awash,</b> {{there is}} a {{junction}} with the Awashâ€“Hara Gebeya Railway, which is under construction as of 2017. Directly after <b>Awash</b> station, the railway crosses the <b>Awash</b> River canyon with a 155 meters long bridge 60 meters above the canyon. It is the longest bridge of the whole railway. The railway then proceeds further northeastwards. After passing Dire Dawa, the railway changes course and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the border between Dewele and Ali Sabieh, it reaches the Djibouti passenger terminal at Nagad railway station, near Djiboutiâ€“Ambouli International Airport. Freight trains continue to the Port of Doraleh on diesel power.|$|E

25|$|Train {{stops on}} open {{stretches}} without platform can outnumber train stops in railway stations by a 2:1 margin, but these stopovers on open stretches {{are usually not}} included, when railway stations are counted. There are 25 dedicated railway stations along the railway with 23 having a single platform for passengers to enter or to leave trains. These platforms allow access without having the need to use stairs. Only the Furi-Labu railway station (and the <b>Awash</b> railway station after completed expansion in 2018) have two platforms connected through a footbridge above the overhead catenary system. This footbridge also has elevators at both ends for mobility-reduced passengers. The platforms are roofed to protect passengers against sun, wind and rain. Railway stations for passenger trains always have a station building directly attached {{to the back of}} the principal platform. Consequently, all railway stations with a single platform have space for only one platform line and do not allow the presence of more than one train at the platform at the same time. In contrast, the Furi-Labu and <b>Awash</b> railway stations with their two platforms have the space for two (Furi-Labu) or three (<b>Awash)</b> platform lines. All platforms are around 330 meters long. The <b>Awash</b> railway station plays a special role as it sits at the junction of two railway lines.|$|E

25|$|Many {{important}} fossil localities {{exist in}} the Afar region, including the Middle <b>Awash</b> region and the sites of Hadar, Dikika, and Woranso-Mille. These sites have produced specimens of the earliest (fossil) hominins and of human tool culture, {{as well as many}} fossils of various flora and fauna.|$|E
25|$|The Minekaze class {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} distinctive design innovations including a lengthened forecastle with a break forming a well deck immediately forward of the bridge.

25|$|Jean Barts 380mm turret {{was quickly}} repaired. On 10 November, Jean Bart opened fire again, and almost hit , the Task Force 34 flagship. In retaliation, bombers from Ranger inflicted severe damage on Jean Bart with two heavy bombs hitting {{the bow and}} the stern, causing the French {{battleship}} to sink into the harbor mud with decks <b>awash.</b>|$|E
25|$|With the {{increased}} demand in urban living downtown, there was interest in converting the structure to residential uses. However, the complex was <b>awash</b> with asbestos, which {{would need to}} be removed before any remodeling could begin. The complex was also poorly configured for residential, as it had a lot of floor space without windows, requiring demolition of some buildings. The two combinations made for an expensive reconversion.|$|E

25|$|As the {{transport}} was being abandoned Trout proceeded close aboard and passed 12 to 15 life boats. The enemy ship was ablaze {{and low in}} the water with her bow nearly <b>awash.</b> Sound heard a heavy explosion from Yamashiro Maru and, seven minutes later, Trout could see no trace of her. That night, the submarine set a course for Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 4 October 1943.|$|E
25|$|Rowing in {{headwinds}} or even moderately rough {{weather was}} difficult {{as well as}} exhausting. In high seas, ancient galleys would set sail to run before the wind. They were highly susceptible to high waves, and could become unmanageable if the rowing frame (apostis) came <b>awash.</b> Ancient and medieval galleys are assumed to have sailed only with the wind more or less astern with {{a top speed of}} 8-9 knots in fair conditions.|$|E
25|$|She wrecked at 11pm and by 1am she was <b>awash</b> and {{her crew}} {{was forced to}} take to the rigging. Two persons on Cuckoo died of exposure.

During the sinking a falling spar broke Paddonâ€™s right shoulder-blade and two of his ribs, injuries that would bother him {{for the rest of his}} life. The Dutch rescued the surviving crew who surrendered to troops from Amsterdam.|$|E
25|$|Following World War I, the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics {{conducted}} studies {{concerning the}} possibility of submarine-borne observation and scouting aircraft. After surfacing, this plane should be rolled out and quickly assembled. It was planned to launch the seaplane by ballasting the submarine until the deck was <b>awash.</b> The Navy ordered two types of aircraft, the Martin MS-1, constructed of wood and fabric, and the all-metal Cox-Klemin XS. The MS-1 first flew from Lake Erie in early 1923.|$|E
25|$|The Afar Triangle is {{a cradle}} {{source of the}} {{earliest}} hominins. It contains a paleo-archaeological district that includes the Middle <b>Awash</b> region and numerous prehistoric sites of fossil hominin discoveries, including: the hominids and possible hominins, Ardi, or Ardipithecus ramidus, and Ardipithecus kadabba, see below; the Gona (Gawis cranium) hominin; several sites of the world's oldest stone tools; Hadar, the site of Lucy, the fossilized specimen of Australopithecus afarensis; and Dikika, {{the site of the}} fossilized child Selam, an australopithecine hominin.|$|E
25|$|The eastern {{escarpment}} is {{the best}} defined of these outer ranges. It has a mean height of , and in many places rises almost perpendicularly from the plain. Narrow and deep clefts, through which descend mountain torrents that lose themselves in the sandy soil of the Eritrean coast, afford means of reaching the plateau, or the easier route through the <b>Awash</b> Valley may be chosen. On surmounting this rocky barrier, the traveller finds that the encircling rampart rises little above the normal level of the plateau.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} concession of March 14, 1925 {{covered all}} of Iraq, but IPC {{was reluctant to}} develop it quickly and production was restricted to fields constituting only one-half of 1 percent of the country's total area. During the Great Depression, the world was <b>awash</b> with oil and greater output from Iraq would simply have driven the price down to even lower levels. Delaying tactics were employed not only in actual drilling and development, but also in conducting negotiations on such matters as pipeline rights-of-way.|$|E
25|$|Overtaking the disorganized convoy, {{during a}} {{tropical}} squall the next day, Ray fired on two radar contacts scoring hits. When the weather cleared, Ray saw one ship whose stack was going under and whose bow was {{rising from the}} water.

As no further suitable contacts were found, the submarine returned to Fremantle, arriving on 14 June.|$|E
25|$|Brazil {{was able}} to raise its foreign debt because, at the time, the {{international}} financial system was <b>awash</b> in petrodollars and was eagerly offering low-interest loans. By {{the end of the}} 1970s, however, the foreign debt had reached high levels. Additionally, the marked increase of international interest rates raised the debt service, forcing the country to borrow more only to meet interest payments. Productive capacity, exports, and the substitution of imports in various sectors expanded and became more diversified. However, the expected impacts on Brazil's current account were not to materialize until the mid-1980s.|$|E
