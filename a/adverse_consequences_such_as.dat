5000|$|According to the {{opinions}} in the case, the plaintiff Mallinckrodt owned {{a patent on}} a device for dispensing a radioactive mist used in taking diagnostic lung X-rays, and for trapping the mist after use. Mallinckrodt sold the device to hospitals for about $40 or $50. Hospital personnel would load the device with a suitable radioactive fluid to perform a diagnostic procedure on a patient, use the device, and then discard it. Mallinckrodt labeled the devices it sold with the notice “Single use only.” Because the device itself cost approximately $10 to make but was sold {{for four or five}} times that, most of the purchase price that hospitals paid Mallinckrodt apparently represented the value of the patent (or the patented technology). This fact apparently led the defendant Medipart to go into the recycling business, in which Mallinckrodt itself had no direct interest (it chose to sell only new devices). For a $20 recycling fee, Medipart would clean one of the devices for a hospital, replace some parts, subject the device to gamma radiation to kill germs, and return it to the hospital for reuse. The district court and court of appeals opinions do not support the claim that a health or safety problem existed. However, Mallinckrodt asserted to the court that [...] "potential <b>adverse</b> <b>consequences,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> infectious disease transmission” provided the reason for its imposing the restriction against reuse.|$|E

30|$|Internalizing {{problems}} include controlled behavior directed mainly toward {{oneself and}} creating difficulties {{for the person}} presenting them, hence the importance in their relationship with social skills (Tandon, Cardeli, & Luby, 2009). Internalizing problems present three interrelated aspects: at the cognitive level (irrational negative thoughts), at the physical level {{with the presence of}} tension symptoms (fears), and at the behavioral level (deficit of social skills). People with internalizing problems show considerable inhibition, difficulties in communication, and poor interaction with others, which prevent them from developing skills and socially competent mechanisms (Alarcón Parco, Jó, & Patricia, 2015).

40|$|Abstract — Alarmed {{physiological}} monitors {{have become}} a standard part of the ICU. While the alarms generated by these monitors can be important indicators of an altered physiological condition, most are unhelpful to medical staff due to {{a high incidence of}} false and clinically insignificant alarms. High numbers of false/insignificant alarms can lead to several <b>adverse</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> increased patient anxiety, distraction of clinicians, and decreased efficiency in delivery of care. Furthermore, repeated false/insignificant alarms may increase the chance that healthcare providers ignore clinically significant alarms. In this paper we review the current state of intelligent alarm processing and describe an integrated systems methodology to extract clinically relevant information from physiological data. Such a method would aid significantly in the reduction of false alarms and provide nursing staff with a more reliable indicator of patient condition. I...|$|E

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the psychometric properties of three screening instruments: the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI), the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI) and the Sherbrooke Postal Questionnaire (SPQ). For validation purposes the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale (GARS) was added. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to 687 community-dwelling older people (≥ 70 years).

40|$|Extract] Children's {{rights to}} have their views heard in matters that affect their lives are now well {{established}} {{since the publication of}} the UN Convention treaty (United Nations 1989). There is considerable support for involving children in the healthcare decision-making process, and a dearth of well-articulated reasons to exclude them. Children's participation in health matters has been demonstrated to reduce healthcare use (McPherson 2006), increase adherence (De Winter 2002), increase internal locus of control and decision-making ability (Tiffenberg 2000), enhance competence, decrease fears and concerns (Runeson 2002), and promote satisfaction with health care (Freed 1998). Lack of involvement can have <b>adverse</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> increased fears and anxieties, reduced self-esteem, depersonalization, and feeling unprepared for procedures (Coyne 2006).

40|$|People {{seem to have}} {{difficulties}} when perceiving events whose outcome has no influence {{on the outcome of}} future events. This illusion that patterns exist where there are none may lead to <b>adverse</b> <b>consequences,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> escalating losses in financial trading or gambling debt. Despite the enormous social consequences of these cognitive biases, however, their neural underpinnings are poorly understood.

40|$|Recent debates have {{suggested}} that increasing social diversity within western economies is associated with <b>adverse</b> social <b>consequences</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> loss of community and decline of civic society, including an erosion of collective efficacy (i. e. shared expectations of and mutual engagement by residents in social control). In the UK and US, these debates have been given impetus by concerns about the effects on community life of growing ethnic heterogeneity. Here there is an assumption that heterogeneity undermines social cohesion and makes the established population less willing to share resources, trust fellow citizens and eventually “hunker down” and withdraw from collective life. To date there are few studies that have examined this in detail across England at the small area level.
