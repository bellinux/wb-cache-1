5000|$|The FPS-16 system {{originally}} {{planned for the}} Project Mercury tracking network did not have adequate displays and controls for reliably acquiring the spacecraft in the acquisition time available. Consequently, a contract was negotiated with a manufacturer to provide the instrumentation radar acquisition (IRACQ)RAnge Acquisition modifications. For the near earth spacecraft involved a major limitation of the FPS-16 was its mechanical range gear box, a wonderful piece of engineering. However, for a target at a range typically, say, [...] at <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> AOS, the radar was tracking second time around, that is, the pulse received in this interpulse period was that due to the previously transmitted pulse, {{and it would be}} indicating a range of [...] As the range closed the return pulse became {{closer and closer to the}} time at which the next transmitter pulse should occur. If they were allowed to coincide, remembering that the transmit-receive switch disconnected the receive (Rx) and connected the transmit (Tx) to the antenna at that instant, track would be lost. So, IRACQ provided an electronic ranging system, the function of which was to provide the necessary gating pulses to the Az and El receiver channels so that the system would maintain angle track. The system utilized a voltage controlled crystal oscillator VCXO as the clock generator for the range counters. An early/late gate system derived an error voltage which either increased a closing target or decreased an opening target the clock frequency, thus causing the gates to be generated so as to track the target. It also, when the target reached an indicated range of less than 16000 yd, took over the generation of transmitter trigger pulses and delayed these by 16000 yd, thus enabling the received pulses to pass through the Big Bang, as it was called, of normally timed Tx pulses. The radar operator, would, while IRACQ maintained angle track be slewing the range system from minimum range to maximum so as to regain track of the target at its true range of <500 nmi (900 km). As the target passed through point of closest approach (PCA) and increased in range the process was repeated at maximum range indication. The most difficult passes were those in which the orbit was such that the target came to PCA at a range of, say 470 nmi. That pass required the radar operator to work very hard as the radar closed, and then opened in range through the Big Bang in short order. The IRACQ Console contained a C-scope associated with which was a small joy stick which gave C-scope operator control of the antenna angle servo systems so that he could adjust the pointing angle to acquire the signal. IRACQ included a scan generator which drove the antenna in one of several pre-determined search patterns around the nominal pointing position, it being desirable that IRACQ acquire the target as early as possible. An essential feature of this modification is that it allows examination of all incoming video signals and allows establishment of angle-only track. Once the spacecraft has been acquired, in angle range. Other features of the IRACQ system included additional angle scan modes and radar phasing controls to permit multiple radar interrogation of the spacecraft beacon. The addition of a beacon local oscillator wave meter permitted the determination of spacecraft-transmitter frequency drift.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Compressive sensing (CS) is an {{alternative}} to Shannon/Nyquist sampling for acquiring sparse or compressible signals. Instead of taking N periodic samples, we measure M ≪ N inner products with random vectors and then recover the signal via a sparsity-seeking optimization or greedy algorithm. A new framework for CS based on unions of subspaces can improve signal recovery by including dependencies between values and locations of the signal’s significant coefficients. In this paper, we extend this framework to the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> ensembles under a common sparse supports model. The new framework provides recovery algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees. Additionally, the framework scales naturally to large sensor networks: the number of measurements needed for each signal does not increase as the network becomes larger.

40|$|The {{delivery}} of the S/C by the launcher into a Low Earth Orbit (LEO), followed {{by a series of}} long duration manoeuvres to guide it to its final operational orbit around L 1 is a particular challenge for the signal acquisition. The complexity is {{explained by the fact that}} the dispersion of a launcher such as VEGA or Rockot greatly exceeds the 3 dB (half-power) beam width of a 15 m ESA network antenna in X-band. Furthermore, the S/C is flying over the short duration ground station passes equipped with a Low Gain Antenna of 9 dB gain variation, transmitting telemetry in low power mode and with an altitude varying from 200 to 1600 km. The solution found to cope with a large orbit dispersion was to develop an X-band Acquisition Aid (XAA), small diameter antenna (1. 2 m) covering the full 3 σ orbit dispersion area within its half-power beam width. However, such a small antenna is limited in its capability in acquiring a downlink signal. Given the specified LPF 200 x 1600 km LEOP orbit and the S/C launch configuration (low power mode and high data rate), the signal strength received by the XAA is not sufficient to guarantee carrier recovery when the S/C altitude exceeds 630 km. It should be noted that the orbit dispersion increases not only as a function of the antenna elevation, but also as a function of flight time. This underlines the necessity to accomplish the spacecraft initial acquisition as soon as possible using the available short station passes. The other issue is that once the 1 st acquisition has succeeded and the orbit is known with enough accuracy, the S/C is brought to its escape orbit to L 1 via a sequence of large main engine burns. If the full range of main engine performance 0 % to 110 %, is considered, this leads to significant time as well as azimuth shift of the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> (AOS) location.

40|$|The area of perceptual {{decision-making}} research {{seeks to}} understand how our perception of the world affects our judgment. Laboratory investigations of perceptual decision-making concentrate on observers 2 ̆ 7 ability to discriminate among stimuli and their biases towards reporting one stimulus more frequently than others. Choice theories assume that these performance measures are determined by generalization of reinforcement along both stimulus and response dimensions. Historically the majority of research has addressed situations in which the difference among stimuli and resulting consequences of a perceptual decision are static. Consequently, {{little is known about}} the dynamics of stimulus and response generalization. The present research investigated the dynamics of discrimination accuracy and response bias by frequently varying differences among stimuli and the outcomes for correct decisions. In Experiment 1, four rats responded in a two-stimulus, two-response detection procedure employing temporal stimuli (short vs. long houselight presentations). Sample stimulus difference was varied over two levels across experimental conditions. A rapid acquisition procedure was employed in which relative reinforcer frequency varied daily. Shifts in response bias were well described by a behavioral model of detection (Davison 2 ̆ 6 Nevin, 1999). Within sessions, bias adjusted rapidly to current reinforcer ratios when the sample stimulus difference was large, but not when the difference was small. In Experiment 2, three rats responded in a five-stimulus, two-response detection procedure employing temporal stimuli. Relative reinforcer frequency was again varied daily. Control by current session reinforcer ratios increased rapidly within sessions in a nearly monotonic fashion. Furthermore, response bias following each sample stimulus was observed within the first few trials of an experimental session. The speed of changes in response bias, especially following an unreinforced probe stimulus, provide strong support for an effective reinforcement process and suggest that this process may operate at a trial-by-trial level. In Experiment 3, three rats responded in a six-stimulus, two-response classification procedure. A repeated-acquisition procedure was employed in which the relationship between classes of short and long sample stimuli and their respective correct comparison locations reversed every 15 sessions. After several reversals, the probabilities of reinforcement for correct classification were also manipulated. In the majority of conditions across subjects, response bias reached half-asymptotic levels more rapidly than did discrimination accuracy. These findings provide some support for a backward chaining account of the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> detection performance. An attention-augmented behavioral detection model accurately described the acquisition data; however parameter estimates expressing the probability of attending to sample and comparison stimuli differed widely among subjects. The results of these experiments support the adaptation of dynamic research methodologies to the study of learning in perceptual decision-making tasks. Furthermore, discrimination performance and response bias adapt rapidly to frequent changes in reinforcement contingencies. Quantitative models formulated to describe static performance in detection procedures can be extended to predict dynamic performance. Some theoretical assumptions of these models were supported and others were violated. Overall, this research supports a renewed emphasis on learning in signal detection procedures and suggests that stable behavioral endpoints are at least as much a function of contingency variables as they are of sensory variables...|$|E

40|$|A partir da descoberta dos íntrons, muitas questões sobre sua origem vêm sendo discutidas como: porque eles existem em eucariotos e não são encontrados em procariotos, quando e como eles se originaram. Basicamente duas hipóteses existem para explicar a origem dos íntrons: ïntrons-earlyëïntrons-late. ̈ A primeira hipótese sugere que íntrons e éxons já existiam nos primeiros genes e os íntrons foram perdidos posteriormente na linhagem de bactérias. A hipótese oponente, introns-late, assume que os íntrons foram adicionados posteriormente durante a evolução, somente em eucariotos. Introns de genes diferentes podem sofrer recombinação durante a divisão celular e assim formar novos genes. Este processo permite e aumenta a freqüência de troca completa de éxons e, conseqüentemente, aumenta a probabilidade de novos genes funcionais serem formados. Este fenômeno é chamado de ëxon-{{shuffling}}ë é um mecanismo importante em relação a origem de muitas proteínas novas em eucariotos. Entretanto, o papel do exon-shuffling na criação das proteínas no ancestral comum dos procariotos e eucariotos é o ponto de discordância entre as hipóteses introns-early e introns-late porque este mecanismo depende da presença dos introns no progenoto. Excesso de éxons simétricos é considerado uma evidência de exon-shuffling, já que a troca de éxons flanqueados por íntrons da mesma fase não muda o quadro de leitura do gene receptor. Nesta tese, apresentamos dois estudos relacionados ao papel do fenômeno de exon-shuffling na evolução das proteínas. No primeiro estudo, observamos que existe uma correlação significativa entre unidades simétricas de shuffling e a idade de domínios protéicos. Domínios antigos, presentes em procariotos e eucariotos, são mais freqüentemente flanqueados por íntrons de fase zero e são preferencialmente localizados nas partes centrais das proteínas. Domínios modernos são mais freqüentemente flanqueados por íntrons de fase um e estão presentes predominantemente nas extremidades das proteínas. Propomos um modelo no qual o shuffling de domínios antigos flanqueados por íntrons de fase zero deve ter sido importante durante a criação das partes centrais das proteínas no ancestral comum de eucariotos e procariotos. Shuffling de domínios modernos, predominantemente flanqueados por íntrons de fase um, deve ter sido importante para a origem das extremidades das proteínas durante a evolução de eucariotos. O segundo estudo trata do possível papel do exon-shuffling na evolução de peptídeos sinal em proteínas humanas. Recentemente, foi mostrado que existe uma predominância de íntrons de fase um próximo ao sítio de clivagem de peptídeos sinal em genes humanos [Tordai, H., Patthy, L. (2004) FEBS lett. 575 : 109 - 111]. Os autores sugeriram que tal distribuição é causada pela inserção de íntrons em sítios de inserção preferencial AGG. Apresentamos evidências de que o sinal observado não é tão forte como inicialmente mostrado e que não existe excesso desproporcional de AGG que daria suporte a inserção em sítios preferenciais. Como estas proteínas evoluíram através de exon-shuffling, levantamos a possibilidade de que este fenômeno possa também ter sido amplamente responsável pelo excesso de íntrons de fase um. Acreditamos que os dados presentes nestes dois estudos representam uma contribuição importante para o campo de estudo de evolução de íntrons e do fenômeno de exon-shuffling porque estes apresentam dados importantes e originais acerca do papel do ëxon-shufflingäntigo e moderno durante a evolução das proteínas. Since {{the discovery}} of introns, many questions about their origin have been raised such as: why they exist in eukaryotic organisms and not in prokaryotes, when {{and how did they}} originate. Mainly, there are two hypotheses explaining the origin of introns: ?introns-early? and ?introns-late?. The first hypothesis suggests that introns and exons already existed in the first genes and were lost later in the bacteria lineage. The opposing hypothesis, introns-late, assumes that introns were inserted late in evolution, in eukaryotic organisms only. Introns from different genes may suffer recombination during cell division and this way form new genes. This process allows and increases the frequency of exchanging complete exons and, consequently, increases the probability of forming new functional genes. This phenomenon is called ?exon-shuffling? and is an important mechanism accounting for the origin of many new proteins in eukaryotes. However, the role of exon-shuffling in the creation of proteins in the ancestor of prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the point of disagreement between the hypotheses ïntrons-earlyänd ïntrons-lateb̈ecause this mechanism depends of the presence of introns in the progenote. Excess of symmetric exons is thought to represent evidence for exon-shuffling since the exchange of exons flanked by introns of the same phase does not disrupt the reading frame of the host gene. In this thesis, we present two studies concerning the role of the exon-shuffling phenomenon in protein evolution. In the first study, we found that there is a significant correlation between symmetric units of shuffling and the age of protein domains. Ancient domains, present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, are more frequently bounded by phase zero introns and their distribution is biased towards the central part of proteins. Modern domains are more frequently bounded by phase one introns and are present predominantly at the ends of proteins. We propose a model in which shuffling of ancient domains mainly flanked by phase zero introns would have been important during the creation of the central part of proteins in the ancestor of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Shuffling of modern domains, predominantly flanked by phase one introns, would have accounted for the origin of the extremities of proteins during eukaryotic evolution. The second study accounts the possible role of exon-shuffling in the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> peptides in human proteins. It was recently shown that there is a predominance of phase one introns near the cleavage site of signal peptides of human genes [Tordai, H., Patthy, L. (2004) FEBS lett. 575 : 109 - 111]. The authors suggested that it was due to intron insertion at AGG proto-splice sites. We present evidence that the signal observed is not as strong as initially shown and that there is no disproportional excess of AGG that would support insertion at proto-splice sites. As these proteins evolved by exon-shuffling, we raise the possibility that this phenomenon might also be largely responsible for such excess of phase one introns. We believe the data present in these two studies represent an important contribution to the field of introns and exon-shufling evolution due to their important and original data concerning the role of ancient and modern exon-shuffling during the evolution of the proteins...|$|E

The second algorithm introduces the concept <b>of</b> assisted <b>acquisition.</b> It is shown that <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> any one <b>signal</b> can assist <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> the rest from that LocataLite allowing reduction in mean acquisition time (MAT) and computational load. Key words Weak signal acquisition, Sensitivity improvement, Locata...|$|R
