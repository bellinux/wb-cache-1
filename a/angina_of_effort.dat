40|$|T H E {{symptoms}} signalling {{the onset}} of occlusion of a coronary artery with infarction, when thrombosis furnishes the determining factor in com-pleting the closure, are striking and dramatic. In times past, certain rea-sons no doubt contributed {{to the failure of}} clinical recognition {{of the nature of the}} pathologic process causing the symptoms. Prominent among these reasons is a certain similarity in the character of the pain to that in the <b>angina</b> pectoris <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> and the fact that coronary occlusion often develops in patients with that symptom-complex, or less often may furnish a basis on which later anginal symptoms develop.

The study was to investigate the relationship between DP transition and ST segment depression in electrocardiogram during exercise. Thirty-one patients <b>of</b> <b>angina</b> pectoris <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> and 140 elderly persons performed a continuous incremental exercise test using a stationary bicycle ergometer. During the entire test, HR and blood pressure were measured every 15 seconds and an electrocardiogram was recorded continuously. DPBP was then calculated. In ten of the 31 patients, ST level depression above - 0. 1 mV with a typical ischemic form in lead V 5 was observed during the test. However, workload at the DPBP was significantly lower than that of the ischemic threshold on the electrocardiogram (i. e. - 0. 1 mV of ST depression) in relation to work load (46 +/- 16 vs. 78 +/- 20 watts), HR (96 +/- 13 vs. 117 +/- 13 bpm), SBP (160 +/- 20 vs. 199 +/- 31 mmHg) and DP (15400 +/- 3400 vs. 23400 +/- 4900 bpm × mmHg).

40|$|SUMMARY The {{effects of}} {{verapamil}} were assessed in 26 patients with stable exertional angina pectoris in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover protocol using serial treadmill tests. Verapamil, 480 mg/day, reduced anginal frequency from 5. 6 + 7. 3 to 2. 2 ± 3. 9 attacks per week (p < 0. 001) and nitroglycerin consumption from 3. 4 ± 4. 9 to 1. 2 ± 2. 5 tablets. per week (p < 0. 05) compared with placebo. Treadmill time increased from 6. 4 ± 2. 1 minutes during the placebo phase to 7. 5 ± 1. 8 minutes during the verapamil phase (p < 0. 001). Verapamil's beneficial effect {{appeared to be}} related, in part, to a 10 % reduction of the rate-pressure product at rest (p < 0. 05) and a 12 % reduction during submaximal exercise (p < 0. 001). Verapamil also caused less marked ST-segment depressions at peak exercise (p < 0. 05) at a similar rate-pressure product, suggesting a favorable redistribution of coronary {{blood flow to the}} ischemic zone. Side effects from verapamil were minimal, consisting mainly of constipation (six patients).

40|$|The chief site {{of action}} of the calcium {{antagonist}} drugs is the slow calcium channel in two tissues: the atrioventricular node and vascular smooth muscle. The exact mode whereby these agents work is still unknown, but recently studies with radioligands suggest that the binding site for the dihydropyridines such as nifedipine {{is different from the}} site for the verapamil group (including diltiazem). In some way these agents 'close ' or 'block ' the calcium channels. Verapamil and diltiazem are active against the calcium channel of the atrioventricular node which nifedipine in clinical doses is not; in contrast, nifedipine is more active on peripheral vascular arterial muscle, presumably inhibiting the calcium channel more strongly. An intracellular {{site of action}} of these agents on calmodulin in vascular smooth muscle cannot be excluded. Clinically, the chief calcium antagonists (verapamil, nifedipine, diltiazem) constitute a powerful group of cardioactive agents with a spectrum of therapeutic actions rather similar to beta-adrenoceptor blockade, being effective in <b>angina</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> and rest, and hypertension. Critical differences are dependent on the individual properties of the calcium antagonists. Thus only verapamil and diltiazem are effective in inhibiting the AV node while the dihydropyridines such as nifedipine are only vasodilators in clinical doses. As a group, calcium antagonists cause vascular dilation and do not cause bronchial constriction, in contrast to the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. In many patients these diverse properties allow safe combination of calcium antagonists and beta-adrenoceptor blockers if due care is observed...|$|E

40|$|Patients with {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM) are predisposed to diffuse and rapidly progressing forms of atherosclerosis which significantly increasesthe probability of surgical revascularization of myocardium. However, unique pathophysiological features of atherosclerosis in DM patients are responsible fortheirunusual reaction to an arterial injury associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Numerousstudies showed that DM {{is an independent}} risk factor of restenosis following successful balloon angioplasty or stenting of coronary arteries and significantly increases the need for secondary myocardial revascularization that compromises {{the outcome of the}} treatment. Preliminary data indicate that the use of drug-releasing stents decreases the need for repeat interventions in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients without negative effect on certain clinical end-points, such as myocardial infarction and mortality.

Surgical revascularization, PCI and aortocoronary bypass surgery (ACB) is indicated to patients that remain symptomatic despite adequate conservative therapy. The choice of an optimal revascularization strategy is of primary importance for DM patients with multiple lesions in the coronary system. Randomized studies comparing multivascularPCI with balloon angioplasty and holometallic stents demonstrated the advantage of ACB for DM patients who showed a higher survival rate, lower frequency of infarctions and secondary revascularization.

Results When the subjects were grouped into those with an age- and fat-free mass-adjusted peak oxygen uptake above and below the mean of 60. 4 mmol/min (1. 34 l/min), the hazard ratios (below/above) (95 % confidence interval) for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease incidence, and incidence of myocardial infarction, after allowance for conventional cardiovascular risk factors, were 2. 08 (1. 23 – 3. 52), 2. 13 (1. 22 – 3. 69), and 2. 36 (0. 84 – 6. 67), respectively. For those unable to achieve a level of work requiring an oxygen uptake of 67 mmol/min (1. 5 l/min) during progressive exercise, the respective hazard ratios were 3. 49 (1. 57 – 7. 76), 2. 29 (1. 21 – 4. 33), and 5. 45 (1. 22 – 24. 34).

Throughout the study, a stable dose of propranolol (295 ± 83 [mean ± standard deviation] mg/day) was administered. In addition to propranolol therapy, each patient was given 2 weeks of up-titration of open label verapamil, 1 week of verapamil down-titration and two 2 week periods of randomized, double-blind therapy, one of placebo and the other of verapamil (431 ± 77 mg/day). A propranolol-verapamil combination caused a decline in anginal episodes/ week (7. 3 ± 6. 9 /week during propranolol-placebo, 4. 7 ± 5. 0 /week during propranolol-verapamil, p = 0. 03) and nitroglycerin tablets used/week (7. 6 ± 6. 6 /week during propranolol-placebo, 4. 4 ± 4. 2 /week during propranolol-verapamil, p = 0. 008). With propranolol-placebo, all 13 patients had angina after 4. 6 ± 2. 1 minutes of supine bicycle exercise. With propranolol-verapamil, five had no angina with exercise even though their duration of exercise increased; in the other eight, time to angina increased (from 4. 0 ± 1. 5 minutes with propranolol-placebo to 5. 3 ± 1. 6 minutes with propranolol-verapamil, p = 0. 01). A propranolol-verapamil combination induced no change in rest or peak exercise left ventricular volumes or ejection fraction (assessed by equilibrium gated blood pool scintigraphy). With propranolol-verapamil, four patients had PR interval prolongation, and two had fatigue and dyspnea. In addition, two had marked sinus bradycardia with junctional escape rhythm that was resolved with a reduction of verapamil dosage. No patient developed congestive heart failure or high degree atrioventricular block.

Objectives: The objectives of this observational clinical study were (1) {{to determine whether}} the return <b>of</b> <b>angina</b> is immutable; (2) to identify factors that might delay its return, and (3) to evaluate whether its return is predictive of subsequent adverse events. Methods: The return <b>of</b> <b>angina</b> <b>of</b> any degree of severity and morbid events subsequent to its return mere studied by multivariable time-related analyses in a consecutive series of 9600 patients who mere undergoing primary isolated coronary bypass operations between 1971 and 1992. Results: The freedom rate from return <b>of</b> <b>angina</b> was 93 %, 82 %, 61 % and 38 % at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years, Increased modest risk of early return <b>of</b> <b>angina</b> was associated with preoperative demographic, symptom, coronary and vascular disease variables but reduced by more extensive arterial grafting. The ever-increasing risk of late return <b>of</b> <b>angina</b> was associated with demographic, symptomatic, left ventricular function, and coronary disease variables and was related strongly to comorbidity but was weakly reduced by controllable surgical variables. After the return <b>of</b> <b>angina,</b> 10 -year freedom rate from infarct and survival was 71 % and 68 % respectively. Conclusions: (1) The risk <b>of</b> <b>angina</b> return increases relentlessly after operation, so it is likely immutable.

40|$|SUMMARY Using a {{double-blind}} protocol, {{we investigated}} {{the use of}} propranolol in patients with coro-nary artery spasm as assessed by subjective and objective variables. Both low-dose (40 mg every 6 hours) and high-dose (160 mg every 6 hours) propranolol were administered. At both doses, the duration of angina attacks was significantly prolonged but the frequency was not. We conclude that propranolol at doses up to 160 mg every 6 hours as single therapy is frequently detrimental in angina pectoris due to coronary artery spasm {{and should not be}} used as the sole treatment of this disorder. PROPRANOLOL reduces heart work for any level of physical activity and thus has become the mainstay of therapy in angina pectoris. " 2 Its effectiveness in classic angina pectoris 3 and unstable angina pectoris 4 is well-established. It is being investigated as a tool for salvaging the ischemic myocardium. 6 However, the use of propranolol in patients with coronary artery spasm has caused reasonable concern. Theoretically, blockade of vasodilatory f-adrenergic receptors might worsen spasm by converting the effect of a sym-pathetic stimulus into a pure a-adrenergic vaso-constrictor response. The clinical and morphologic spectrum of coro-nary artery spasm is broad. 6 It may present as <b>angina</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> or angina of rest; the anatomic substrate has ranged from atherosclerosis-free coronary arteries to severely atherosclerotic vessels. In some subjects, a single episode of clinically apparent ischemia is the only manifestation; in others, more than 30 episodes of angina may occur in a single day. The roles of spasm and atherosclerosis in ischemic heart disease are complex. Thus, we examined the effect of a blockade on coronary artery spasm in a group of subjects with as nearly "pure " spasm as we could find. On one end of the coronary spasm spec-trum are patients who have angina at rest with preserved exercise capacity and, in general, less atherosclerosis; they manifest a chronic course with periods of intense disease activity punctuated by quies-cent intervals of months to years. 7 We use the term "vasotonic angina " to describe this subgroup. We chose subjects with vasotonic angina to determine the effect of propranolol on coronary artery spasm...|$|E
