5|$|As Peter {{exits the}} <b>abortion</b> <b>clinic,</b> he notices a pro-life rally nearby. At the rally, a protester shows Peter a video tape {{discouraging}} abortion (as {{a reference to}} the cult classic 1936 American propaganda exploitation film Reefer Madness), portraying it as murder, larceny, jaywalking and securities fraud. The tape claims that abortion prevented Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's would-be assassin, a fourth Stooge brother, of The Three Stooges, and Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden's America-loving brother from being born.|$|E

He eventually mentions the occurrence to Bill, who tells Charlie's parents about it. Charlie's relationship with his sister rapidly deteriorates and she continues to see her boyfriend against her parents' wishes. Eventually, he discovers that his sister is pregnant and agrees to bring her to an <b>abortion</b> <b>clinic</b> without telling anyone.

5000|$|In 2011, VSHL was {{involved}} in the passage of a bill to regulate <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics</b> as [...] "ambulatory surgical centers". The bill, which passed the House by a large margin and passed the Senate after a tiebreaker vote from Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling, contributed to the closure of three of the state's 21 <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics</b> between its enactment in 2011 and the Virginia Board of Health's 2015 vote to end the hospital-style regulations for <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In April 2013, VSHL {{advocated}} {{that the}} Virginia Board of Health require <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics</b> {{to follow the}} same construction standards as hospitals.

[...] "These reasonable regulations will begin to rein in reckless abortionists in Virginia" [...] stated Olivia Gans Turner. In 2015, The Virginia Board of Health voted to remove these requirements on <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics</b> by a vote of 9-6.|$|R
5|$|Out of desperation, Douchebag is told {{to invite}} the girls to play. They agree to join after Douchebag infiltrates an <b>abortion</b> <b>clinic</b> and travels across Canada to {{discover}} which of their friends is spreading gossip.

5|$|Two weeks earlier, in the Beaufort Sea, crewmen {{on a ship}} spot a {{light in}} the sky that soon crashes into the sea. A body is {{retrieved}} from the crash, revealed to be an Alien Bounty Hunter. Two days later, the Bounty Hunter arrives in Scranton, Pennsylvania, at an <b>abortion</b> <b>clinic</b> and kills a doctor by stabbing {{him in the back}} of the neck with a stiletto weapon, then sets the building on fire and escapes. Mulder receives emails containing the doctor's obituary along with two other identical doctors. After interviewing a pro-life priest who had threatened one of the doctors, they are able to use a newspaper advertisement looking for one of the men to track another one, Aaron Baker, to Syracuse, New York.|$|E

50|$|Historically, the {{regulation}} of abortion facilities never played {{a prominent role in}} the Board's work.

25|$|In 1989, {{a scandal}} broke when police raided a private <b>abortion</b> <b>clinic,</b> detaining doctors, nurses and patients.

After her release, one of the victims filed a lawsuit alleging police brutality and the media picked up the story. In a first for Mexico's feminist movement, feminists published a notice in response to the situation, and obtained 283 signatories with different political alliances and gained 427 endorsements.

2500|$|In 1984, Yeomans championed a {{municipal}} by-law to restrict <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics,</b> strip clubs, erotica shops, and tanning studios {{to a remote}} corner of the city. Council later introduced a further, supplementary by-law to require a [...] "buffer zone" [...] between areas reserved for <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics</b> and areas reserved for sex shops. Several feminist groups criticized the by-law for placing access to abortion {{on the same level}} as the purchasing of pornography. Yeomans responded that the legislation was not intended to pass any judgement on the subject of abortion, but rather to ensure that any confrontations or disruptions near <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics</b> would be kept away from residential areas. The by-laws were approved by Dorval city council in January 1985 and came into effect two months later.|$|R
25|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, {{discussing}} abortion in any way, including {{the provision of}} impartial information, was disallowed, and any publication providing information on the medical treatment would be confiscated. In the 1980s, the Irish Family Planning Association and the Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin students' unions were successfully sued by the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children for publishing telephone numbers for abortion clinics in the United Kingdom. On one occasion British newspaper The Guardian was withdrawn by its Irish distributors for a day to preempt a threatened ban due to the inclusion of an advertisement for a UK <b>abortion</b> <b>clinic</b> in that day's issue (despite the advert having appeared {{on a number of}} prior occasions without incident).|$|E
25|$|In Dogma, Metatron {{is portrayed}} by Alan Rickman, stating that he {{acts as the}} Voice of God in {{situations}} where people hear God speak to them, as humanity is psychologically and physically incapable of hearing God's actual voice without their heads exploding.

During a later conversation with Bethany, the Metatron notes that Jesus had trouble adapting to the news that he was God's son and asked Metatron to take it back, with Metatron admitting to Bethany that he regretted placing so much responsibility on a child.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum {{aspiration}} in {{the first}} trimester is the safest method of surgical abortion, and can be performed in a primary care office, <b>abortion</b> <b>clinic,</b> or hospital. Complications are rare and can include uterine perforation, pelvic infection, and retained products of conception requiring a second procedure to evacuate. Infections account for one-third of abortion-related deaths in the United States. The rate of complications of vacuum aspiration abortion {{in the first}} trimester is similar {{regardless of whether the}} procedure is performed in a hospital, surgical center, or office. Preventive antibiotics (such as doxycycline or metronidazole) are typically given before elective abortion, as they are believed to substantially reduce the risk of postoperative uterine infection. The rate of failed procedures does not appear to vary significantly depending on whether the abortion is performed by a doctor or a mid-level practitioner. Complications after second-trimester abortion are similar to those after first-trimester abortion, and depend somewhat on the method chosen. Second-trimester abortions are generally well-tolerated.|$|E
