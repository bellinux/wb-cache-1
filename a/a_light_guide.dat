50|$|The first microstructured light-mixing {{tape was}} {{scheduled}} to be introduced in late 2011. 3M™ Uniformity Tape is designed to be applied directly to the injection edge of <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> for the purpose of defusing the light generated by LEDs. The microstructure consists of linear aspheric prisms (Figure 1) that are aligned perpendicular to the plane of the guide. The size of the microstructure is small compared {{to the size of the}} LEDs, typically on the order of 12-50 μm. As a result, no registration of the tape with the LEDs is required.|$|E

50|$|In {{its current}} iteration, the display {{developed}} by LEIA Inc is a diffraction-based system able to project up to 64 different images {{in different directions}} of space. The diffractive layer extracts LED light from <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> and forms narrow light beams that propagate towards the viewers, unlike regular LED or LCD that send {{a beam of light}} in one direction only. The intensity of each light beam is independently modulated by a dedicated pixel on a front-facing LCD panel. Color can be achieved either via spatial-multiplexing (RGB color filters on dedicated LCD subpixels) or via temporal-multiplexing (time-sequential RGB illumination).The display achieves a wide 60° field of view and offers full parallax to create a seamless 3D impression regardless of head-motion (horizontal / vertical motion, tilt or rotation). The diffracted beam parameters can be adjusted to suppress skipping or “dark zones” between views and repeating images outside the field of view.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the area}} of the screen that can be {{dynamically}} adjusted {{is a function of the}} backlighting source. CCFLs are thin tubes that light up many rows (or columns) across the entire screen at once, and that light is spread out with diffusers. The CCFL must be driven with enough power to light the brightest area of the portion of the image in front of it, so if the image is light on one side and dark on the other, this technique cannot be used successfully. Displays backlit by full arrays of LEDs have an advantage, because each LED lights only a small patch of the screen. This allows the dynamic backlighting to be used on a much wider variety of images. Edge-lit displays do not enjoy this advantage. These displays have LEDs only along the edges and use <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> plate covered with thousands of convex bumps that reflect light from the side-firing LEDs out through the LCD matrix and filters. LEDs on edge-lit displays can be dimmed only globally, not individually. For cost reasons, most of LCD TVs have edge-lit backlighting.|$|E
5000|$|Each cell on a {{plasma display}} must be precharged {{before it is}} lit, {{otherwise}} the cell would not respond quickly enough. This precharging means the cells cannot achieve a true black,, whereas an LED backlit LCD panel can actually turn off parts of the backlight, in [...] "spots" [...] or [...] "patches" [...] (this technique, however, does not prevent the large accumulated passive light of adjacent lamps, and the reflection media, from returning values from within the panel). Some manufacturers have reduced the precharge and the associated background glow, {{to the point where}} black levels on modern plasmas are starting to become close to some high-end CRTs Sony and Mitsubishi produced before ten years before the comparable plasma displays. It {{is important to note that}} plasma displays were developed for ten more years than CRTs; it is almost certain that if CRTs had been developed for as long as plasma displays were, the contrast on CRTs would have been far better than contrast on the plasma displays. With an LCD, black pixels are generated by a light polarization method; many panels are unable to completely block the underlying backlight. More recent LCD panels using LED illumination can automatically reduce the backlighting on darker scenes, though this method cannot be used in high-contrast scenes, leaving some light showing from black parts of an image with bright parts, such as (at the extreme) a solid black screen with one fine intense bright line. This is called a [...] "halo" [...] effect which has been minimized on newer LED-backlit LCDs with local dimming. Edgelit models cannot compete with this as the light is reflected via <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> to distribute the light behind the panel.|$|E
