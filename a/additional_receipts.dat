40|$|In 1998, the Federal {{government}} {{will continue the}} consolidation process. The net deficit of ATS 67. 3 billion amounts to 2. 6 percent of GDP (1997 2. 8 percent). The states and municipalities will also continue to pursue fiscal restraint. Thus, the general government deficit according to the Maastricht criteria will fall to 2. 5 percent of GDP, and Austria will meet an important requirement {{for participation in the}} European Economic and Monetary Union. The reduction in the deficit ratio, which reached 3. 7 in 1996, was achieved by savings on the expenditure side as well as additional (tax) revenues. Federal expenditures as a percentage of nominal GDP are expected to drop from 29. 6 percent in 1996 to 28. 9 percent in 1998, while revenues are projected to rise from 25. 9 percent in 1996 to 26. 3 percent, according to the draft budget for 1998. To an increasing extent, the Federal administration finances the activities of other public sector entities and of private enterprises. This renders difficult an analysis of the (direct) employment effects of the Federal budget. These changes, particularly the decision to move certain items off-budget, mainly concern investment outlays. According to the draft budget for 1998, investment expenditures will total ATS 11. 3 billion, 1. 5 percent of total expenditures in the regular budget. By comparison, investment spending accounted for almost 10 percent of expenditures in the mid- 1970 s. Outlays for the provision of retirement income account for {{a major part of the}} Federal budget. The Federal administration will spend a total of ATS 155 billion on this item, more than 20 percent of total expenditures. Offsetting items on the revenue side are social security contributions by public servants, and payments by the railroads and the postal service; nonetheless, net spending on the pension system (including transfer payments to the social security institutions) is projected to be ATS 136. 8 billion. Interest payments for the public debt also loom large in the Federal budget, amounting to ATS 101. 1 billion in 1998, up 0. 6 percent from 1997. This figure would be higher were it not for the austerity program and the decline in interest rates. At the end of October 1997, the average interest rate of the Federal debt was 6. 0 percent (down from 6. 2 percent at the end of 1996). A drop in the average interest rate by 0. 2 percentage points translates into savings of about ATS 3 billion per year. In the 1998 draft budget, tax revenues are set to rise by 5. 7 percent to ATS 667. 7 billion, but a substantial part of this increase (some ATS 27 billion) is due to measures which will not raise the effective tax rates. This applies to the shift in the time period when a tax refund is recorded (ATS 15 billion) and changes in the value added tax (a limited exemption from the value-added tax for hospitals and social institutions), which will generate ATS 12 billion in <b>additional</b> <b>receipts</b> but which are to be reimbursed. The share of personal income tax receipts will stagnate at 11. 6 percent, after a hefty increase in the previous year.

40|$|In Africa, the {{agricultural}} sector is faced with many problems. Among them is the restricted access to good agricultural land in regions where land area per capita is continually decreasing {{as a result of}} the increasing population growth. Yet it is in these regions where the demand for agricultural products is continually rising. Consequently there is a need to intensify land use. The strategy for achieving this should aim at generating higher yields per unit of land. However this may not be sustainable through production based on the natural fertility of the soil types found in Africa. Increased output of agricultural products can only be achieved if nutrients removed from the fields with the harvests are continuously replaced. Studies are needed that can provide adequate, reliable and up-to-date information which can be used to quantify nutrient removal and fertilizer requirements and hence improve our ability to understand and monitor the processes involved. Large gaps exist between developed and developing nations in terms of agricultural productivity and the quality of life enjoyed by their rural populations. Improvements in the quality of life in many developing nations may be viewed as a race between agricultural production and population growth. In sub-Saharan Africa in particular, this race is being steadily lost because all the modest gains in production are being more than offset by increased population. One of the major consequences of this race is the depletion of soil fertility. Soil depletion is not a simple parameter that can be rapidly evaluated and corrected. It is a situation where diminished availability of under-utilized lands, continuous soil erosion and nutrient removal, coupled with the scarcity of livestock feed, fuel and water resources results in a spiralling decay in productive capacity and a diminished resilience of the soil system to provide a suitable medium for crop growth. The immediate consequences of soil depletion are further deforestation, urban migration and increased unemployment. In short, farmers are increasingly less able to overcome the soil constraints to crop productivity as it becomes more crucial that they be able to do so. Understanding the resource base There is a pressing need to understand better the soil as a resource base and to relate these understandings to soil inventory and land evaluation methods. Soils serve as both a reservoir and source of plant nutrients. The inherent fertility of soils is associated with mineralisation of soil organic matter. Decline in total soil organic matter may often be a fundamental cause of nutrient exhaustion in farming systems that are provided with few external nutrient inputs. While the inherent capacity of a soil to provide plant nutrients may be supplemented through the application of chemical fertilizers, far less fertilizers are being applied per unit of land area in Africa than in other agricultural regions of the world. Intensified agricultural production is best achieved through the use of inorganic fertilizers and calls for the production and importation of the correct forms and quantities for timely distribution. These fertilizers must be supplied at reasonable cost and packaged in amounts suitable for use by small farmers. Fertilizer recommendations should be based on tested information which takes into account individual crop requirements and soil conditions. The overall economic return to the use of fertilizers can be improved by identifying the form, rate of application, timing and placement that offer the highest rate of economic return to farmers. Too often, the results of fertilizer-use trials are viewed in terms of their immediate crop return, rather than as an agroecosystem-wide resource input that interacts with, and may be optimized through, nutrient recycling processes. Another important means of improving nutrient cycling is through the use of applied organic inputs and the retention of crop residues. In many tropical cropping systems, few or no agricultural residues are returned to the soil and this leads to a decline in soil organic matter, lower crop yields and less plant biomass. Application of organic residues and the avoidance of burning are management practices that play an important role in reversing these trends, along with the adoption of reduced tillage systems and the establishment of live mulches. The level of organic matter within a soil is determined by its rates of formation and loss, yet the effect of applying many farmer-available organic resources and agro-industrial wastes remains poorly understood from the perspective of organic matter dynamics. The use of under-utilized, farmer-available organic resources as a means of providing nutrients to the crop and improving fertilizer use efficiency warrants greater attention from agricultural scientists Studies of organic matter dynamics over time must be initiated as a means to develop soil conservation measures that reduce carbon loss from soils. These studies must be further consolidated into improved management practices that are acceptable to farmers. Nutrient retention results from ionic attraction between plant nutrients in solution and the charged surfaces within the soil. These charged surfaces occur in both the mineral and organic fractions, although in highly weathered tropical soils there is a greater dependence on the role of organic matter because of a decreased charge density of mineral oxides. An important factor in the continuous productivity of tropical soils is the maintenance and improvement of soil physical characteristics. Once this is achieved, the production capacity of these soils can be further improved by the use of organic and inorganic fertilizers. Soil toxicity Toxic levels of aluminium and other cations, particularly iron and magnesium, occur in highly weathered, low pH soils that are dominated by oxide mineralogy. High concentrations of these cations interfere with nutrient uptake and, when entering the plant, interfere with sugar phosphorylation and DNA synthesis. One common symptom of cation toxicity is the development ofswollen, stubby roots resulting from an inhibition of root elongation. The situation can be improved by applying lime, although this is frequently unavailable to many sub sistence and local market farmers in the humid tropics. Soil organic matter interacts with toxic cations in two different ways, both of which are beneficial to plants. Humic substances absorb toxic cations resulting in their immobiligation and detoxification. Organic acid from decomposing residues in soils also interact with aluminium in solution, resulting in less toxic forms of aluminium in the soil solution, again without changing the soil pH. While management may be technically feasible at the small farm level, larg application rates of organic residues a required to detoxify acid soils. Unfortunately, the relative effectiveness of most available organic resources in Africa remains unknown. However, relatively simple plant bioassays are available to measure the toxicity of test soils by comparing the root elongation of recently germinated mung bean seedlings. Soil moisture Moisture retention is both an intrinsic property of soils and one that is subject to management practices. The pores of sandy soils are emptied of gravitational water at 0. 1 bar, while silicate layered clayey soils retain this moisture until 0. 5 bar. Other soils, including most of those in the tropics, fall somewhere inbetween. Farmers manage moisture retention in many ways, the most obvious and important one being the reduction of water run-off along the soil surface by terracing, contour ridges and other more elaborate water-capture strategies. Added benefits to run-off reduction are improved control of nutrient losses and lower soil erodibility. A key to reduced run-off and its consequent benefits is the protection of the soil surface with mulch. The depth of rooting is often an overlooked factor affecting the moisture availability and one that need not be universally associated with shallow soils. The ability of plant roots to extract moisture reserves from deeper soil layers may be inhibited by the inability of plant roots to penetrate to that depth by physical and chemical barriers. Little can be done to improve rooting depth in extremely rocky soils. Hardpans can develop in clayey soil immediately beneath the shallow tillage layer, due to compaction from mechanical tillage. The formation of hardpans may be disrupted by occasional deep tillage. Acidic subsoils may limit a rooting system's ability to recover moisture reserves. This is a common limitation in oxisols and ultisols, where moisture in the well-structured surface horizon is depleted but abundant moisture in the acidic subsoil remains unexploited. This problem has various solutions ranging from deep tillage and liming to the use of more acid-tolerant, tap-rooted crops and cultivars. In many cases agricultural researchers and farmers are unaware of rooting limitations. This is an area which requires further research. Irrigation projects Fresh-water resources are under-utilized in many areas where the length of the cropping system is limited by the precipitation pattern and in areas that suffer from periodic droughts but which are of otherwise excellent potential for intensified agriculture in terms of soil fertility and radiation <b>receipts.</b> <b>Additional</b> benefits to the development of irrigation schemes are the opportunities for energy generation and rural electrification. Two hazards to the development of large scale water conservation and irrigation projects are siltation of reservoirs and salinization of irrigated lands over time, often with horrific environmental effects. While national scientists and the private sector are seeking solutions to these problems, a possible alternative is the support of smaller-scale, farm community managed projects.
