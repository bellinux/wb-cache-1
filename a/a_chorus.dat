5|$|<b>A</b> <b>chorus</b> greets {{the dawn}} as Ariadne, after a troubled night's sleep, {{returns to the}} shore with her companion, Dorilla, to find that Theseus has departed. Dorilla offers her comfort. In despair {{at the thought that}} Theseus will not return, Ariadne {{nevertheless}} decides to go to the landing area to wait for him. In a pastoral interlude <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> sings of the joys of rural life, and expresses the hope that Theseus will not forget Ariadne. Primed by an envoy with the news that Ariadne is alone and sorrowing, the chorus again sings in sympathy with her. On the beach, Ariadne sings her lament for her lost love and prepares to kill herself. At this point fanfares are heard heralding an arrival, causing Ariadne to hope that it is Theseus returning. In another interlude the chorus empathises, but a second envoy announces that it is Bacchus who has arrived, having taken pity on Ariadne. A sung ballo celebrates the anticipated betrothal of Bacchus and Ariadne. In the final scene Cupid reappears, and Venus rises from the sea before Jupiter speaks his blessing from the heavens. The union is sealed as Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality in heaven, and a crown of stars.|$|E

5|$|Each act of {{the opera}} deals with a single element of the story, and each ends with <b>a</b> <b>chorus.</b> Despite the five-act structure, with two sets of scene changes, {{it is likely that}} L'Orfeo {{conformed}} to the standard practice for court entertainments of that time and was played as a continuous entity, without intervals or curtain descents between acts. It was the contemporary custom for scene shifts to take place in sight of the audience, these changes being reflected musically by changes in instrumentation, key and style.|$|E

5|$|Hammond organs have a {{built-in}} vibrato effect {{that provides a}} small variation in pitch while a note is being played, and <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> effect where a note's sound is combined with another sound at a slightly different and varying pitch. The best known vibrato and chorus system consists of six settings, V1, V2, V3, C1, C2 and C3 (i.e., three each of vibrato and chorus), which can be selected via a rotary switch. Vibrato / chorus can be selected for each manual independently.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, {{approaches}} to Handel in German and English-speaking countries diverged further. In Leipzig in 1856, the musicologist Friedrich Chrysander and the literary historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus founded the Deutsche Händel-Gesellschaft {{with the aim}} of publishing authentic editions of all Handel's works. At the same time, performances in Britain and the United States moved away from Handel's performance practice with increasingly grandiose renditions. Messiah was presented in New York in 1853 with <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> of 300 and in Boston in 1865 with more than 600.|$|E
5|$|Music {{and dance}} are an {{integral}} part of Cameroonian ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings, and storytelling. Traditional dances are highly choreographed and separate men and women or forbid participation by one sex altogether. The goals of dances range from pure entertainment to religious devotion. Traditionally, music is transmitted orally. In a typical performance, <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> of singers echoes a soloist.|$|E

5|$|The ballad {{speaks of}} the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that {{occurred}} there. The song has two verses and <b>a</b> <b>chorus.</b> The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.|$|E
5|$|To address {{concerns}} that {{the sound of the}} Hammond was not rich enough to accurately mimic a pipe organ, the model BC was introduced in December 1936. It included <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> generator, in which a second tonewheel system added slightly sharp or flat tones to the overall sound of each note. The cabinet was made deeper to accommodate this. Production of the old Model A cases stopped, but the older model continued to be available as the AB until October 1938.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{beginning with}} a biblical quotation for the vox Christi, Jesus speaking. A set of aria and recitative is followed by <b>a</b> <b>chorus</b> on another biblical quotation from the gospel, while an aria leads to the closing chorale. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists (alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo. The duration of the cantata is given as 20 minutes.|$|E

At 18, she moved with her family to St. Petersburg, Florida, where she attended St. Petersburg College (then St. Pete Junior College).
