5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the <b>amplitude</b> of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the <b>amplitude</b> is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in <b>amplitude.</b> Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave <b>amplitude</b> varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E

40|$|By {{exploiting}} {{relations between}} gravity and gauge theories, we present two infinite sequences of one-loop n-graviton scattering amplitudes: the `maximally helicity-violating' <b>amplitudes</b> in N= 8 supergravity, and the `all-plus' helicity <b>amplitudes</b> in gravity with any minimally coupled massless matter content. The all-plus <b>amplitudes</b> correspond to self-dual field configurations and vanish in supersymmetric theories. We {{make use of}} the tree-level Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations between open and closed string theory <b>amplitudes,</b> which in the low-energy limit imply relations between gravity and gauge theory tree <b>amplitudes.</b> For n < 7, we determine the all-plus <b>amplitudes</b> explicitly from their unitarity cuts.

25|$|Tuberous organs, {{the type}} of {{receptive}} organ used for electrocommunication, {{can be divided into}} two types, depending on the way information is encoded: time coders and <b>amplitude</b> coders. There are multiple forms of tuberous organs in each time and <b>amplitude</b> coders, and all weakly electric fish species possess at least one form of the two coders. Time coder fires phase-locked action potential (meaning, the waveform of the action potential is always the same) at a fixed delay time after each outside transient is formed. Therefore, time coders neglect information about waveform and <b>amplitude</b> but focus on frequency of the signal and fire action potentials on a 1:1 basis to the outside transient. <b>Amplitude</b> coders, on the contrary, fire according to the EOD <b>amplitude.</b> While both wave-type and pulse-type fishes have <b>amplitude</b> coders, they fire in different ways: Receptors of wave-type fishes continuously fire at a rate according to their own EOD amplitude; on the other hand, receptors of pulse-type fishes fire burst of spikes to each EOD detected, and the number of spikes in each burst is correlated to the <b>amplitude</b> of the EOD. Tuberous electroreceptors show a V-shaped threshold tuning curve (similar to auditory system), which means that they are tuned to a particular frequency.
