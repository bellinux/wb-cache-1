40|$|Background: Infection by Helicobacter pylori {{is common}} and affects both genders at any age. The 13 C-urea breath test {{is a widely}} used test for the {{diagnosis}} of this infection. However, multiple drugs used {{for the treatment of}} Helicobacter pylori infection symptoms have interactions with this breath test that generate false negative results. This observational study was to assess the potential interaction between <b>almagate</b> and the breath test. Methods: Thirty subjects on <b>almagate</b> therapy who underwent a breath test were included. If the result was negative, <b>almagate</b> was withdrawn for a month and the breath test was then repeated. Results: In general, 51. 9 % of assessed subjects had a negative result after the first test, and 100 % of these also had a negative result after the second test. Conclusions: It was concluded that the use of <b>almagate</b> does not interfere in breath test results. These results provide a drug therapy option for the treatment of symptoms associated with Helicobacter pylori infection during the diagnostic process...|$|E
