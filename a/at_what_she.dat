Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots. To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had witnessed.|$|E
5|$|Season 5, {{the final}} season, opens with summer {{wrapping}} up in Dillon: Billy Riggins joins Coach Taylor {{as a special}} teams coach for the East Dillon Lions. Tami is the new guidance counselor at East Dillon, where she is {{faced with the challenge}} of a particularly difficult student named Epyck.

He's pleased when his son becomes a Lions football player.|$|E
5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E

25|$|Following {{the events}} of Bloody Sunday Bernadette Devlin, an Independent Socialist {{nationalist}} MP from Northern Ireland, expressed anger <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> perceived as government attempts to stifle accounts being reported about the day.

25|$|One {{week later}} Trout {{launched}} two torpedoes <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{thought to be}} a tanker as it emerged from a rain squall. The first torpedo blew off the target's bow but the second was a dud. As the enemy ship was still steaming at eight knots, the submarine surfaced for battle with her deck guns. Trout opened fire, but soon seven of her men were wounded by enemy machine gun fire. She then swung around and fired a stern torpedo and watched Hirotama Maru turn her stern straight up with her screws still turning and slip under the waves. The patrol ended when the submarine returned to Fremantle on 25 February 1943.|$|E

But the High Brahmin’s plan backfires when, rather than {{becoming}} angry with Solor, the Rajah decides that it is Nikiya who must die. Gamzatti, who has eavesdropped on this exchange, summons Nikiya to the palace {{in an attempt to}} bribe the bayadère into giving up her beloved. As their rivalry intensifies, Nikiya picks up a dagger in a fit of rage and attempts to kill Gamzatti, only to be stopped {{in the nick of time}} by Gamzatti’s aya. Nikiya flees in horror <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has almost done. As did her father, Gamzatti vows that the bayadère must die.|$|E

The story created a national sensation. At Beecher's urging, Woodhull {{was arrested in}} New York City and imprisoned for sending obscene material through the mail. The scandal split the Beecher siblings; Harriet and others supported Henry, while Isabella publicly supported Woodhull.|$|E

Her character was written {{to be in her}} late forties to early fifties, easy on the eyes, amicably maladjusted, and a compulsive liar so good <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> does, most people will not know she is not what she seems. Damon Lindelof was quoted in Variety as saying the character [...] "is going to bring a flavor to the show that doesn't exist right now. She's not as intense as some of the other characters. She's that person you want in the trenches with you who can take lemons and make lemonade." ...|$|E

As noted by Ailbhe Malone of NME, [...] Rihanna adopts Jay-Z's vocal style in the lyric, [...] "Brilliant, resilient, fan mail from 27 million." [...] "Hard" [...] is a song about emulating power and strength, and how Rihanna assumes a role of being the best <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> does.

500|$|... "Boys' Club", {{along with}} the five other first season episodes of Parks and Recreation, was {{released}} on a one-disc DVD set in the United States on September 8, 2009. The DVD included cast and crew commentary tracks for each episode, as well as about 30 minutes of deleted scenes. The deleted scenes included on the DVD were originally featured on the official Parks and Recreation website after the episode aired.

500|$|The Drowned World Tour 2001 {{received}} mixed {{response from}} critics. Darryl Sterdan from Jam! commented that [...] "even though the gig isn't exactly mind-blowing— the Matrix-style wire-work probably looked way cooler in person {{than it does}} on TV... the set has enough hits {{to make it a}} decent historical document". According to Orlando Sentinels Ben Wener, Drowned World Tour 2001 was [...] "the same eye-popping show aired this past summer on HBO, only with vastly superior sound and sparkling picture". A reviewer from DVD.net gave the video a rating of six on ten, and the audio a nine on ten. The reviewer praised the DVD saying that [...] "this is a quality release that highlights a performer well and truly on top of her game and for what it's worth, she is probably among the best <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> does." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the concert}} venue, Louise scoffs at the band's obsessed female fans, warns Tina that [...] "a lot of puberty" [...] awaits {{her at the}} concert, and plans to wait outside.

Raya is heart-breaking as the young victim." [...] Steve Rea of The Post and Courier praised Redgrave's acting in the supporting role of Madeleine Rees as [...] "forceful, elegant, precise". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "Weisz gives a psychologically astute performance as a woman who can't leave things alone."

We did a month, and then the day before the cameras turned on, we would go through the moves a couple of times so we wouldn't hurt each other. There were a few times we clipped each other.
