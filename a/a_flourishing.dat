He succeeded in convincing the wali (governor) of the Erzurum Vilayet to lower taxes for Armenians.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, Banagher was {{the centre}} of <b>a</b> <b>flourishing</b> woollen trade. In 1699, the impost placed on the export of woollen goods to England {{practically}} killed the woollen trade. At {{the outbreak of the}} American Revolutionary War in 1775, an embargo placed on the export of foodstuffs to the American Colonies dealt another blow to the trade of Banagher. In 1780, the British Parliament withdrew all these restrictions and Banagher's economy began to improve rapidly.|$|E

Ganguly's father Chandidas Ganguly died at the age of 73 on 21 February 2013 after a long illness.|$|E
5|$|The Latin American Boom was <b>a</b> <b>flourishing</b> of literature, {{poetry and}} {{criticism}} in Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s, when writers from this region explored {{new ideas and}} came to international renown {{in a way that}} had not happened previously. Major figures of the boom include Julio Cortázar, Gabriel García Márquez, Carlos Fuentes, Jorge Luis Borges, and Mario Vargas Llosa.|$|E
5|$|Titanosaurians were <b>a</b> <b>flourishing</b> {{group of}} sauropod dinosaurs during Cretaceous times. The Spanish {{locality}} {{from the latest}} Cretaceous of “Lo Hueco” yielded a relatively well preserved, titanosaurian braincase, which shares a number of unique features with A. atacis from France. However, it appeared to differ from A. atacis in some traits also. The specimen has been provisionally identified as Ampelosaurus sp.; it is most likely a mature titanosaurian since {{the bones of the}} braincase have largely fused together.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the States Reorganisation Act (1956), Mangalore (part of the Madras Presidency until this time) was {{incorporated}} into the dominion of the newly created Mysore State (now called Karnataka). Mangalore is the fourth largest city of Karnataka in terms of population, and eighth largest port of India, providing Karnataka with access to the Arabian Sea coastline. Mangalore experienced significant growth in the decades 1970–80, with the opening of New Mangalore Port in 1974 and commissioning of Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers Limited in 1976. Today, the Mangalore region is a nationally known higher education hub with <b>a</b> <b>flourishing</b> service sector, particularly in medical services, a small but growing IT regional hub, and a booming real estate and banking industry.|$|E
5|$|Emir Sanjar al-Jawli {{acquired}} the governorship of Gaza and central Palestine in 1311. He highly favored Gaza and transformed it into <b>a</b> <b>flourishing</b> city, having built in it a horse-race course, a madrasa (college), a mosque, a khan (caravansary), a maristan (hospital), and a castle. In late 1332, {{coinciding with the}} appointment of Emir Taynal al-Ashrafi as governor, some of the provincial privileges of Gaza, such as the governor's direct subordination to the sultan in Cairo, were removed by an-Nasir Muhammad's decree. From then, and until 1341 when Sanjar al-Jawli served a second term as governor, Gaza became subordinate to the na'ib as-saltana (viceroy) of Syria, Emir Tankiz al-Husami.|$|E
5|$|Ironstone {{outcrops}} {{along the}} northern edge of the South Wales Coalfield were extensively worked for the production of iron and were important in the initiation of the Industrial Revolution in South Wales. Lead was mined at Pentre Halkyn in Flintshire during the Roman occupation of Britain and there were ore-bearing sites in Clwyd where lead, silver and sometimes zinc were mined. These metals were also mined in the upland areas of the Rivers Ystwyth and Rheidol. Manganese, titanium and numerous other minerals occur in various parts of Wales. Gold is found in southern Snowdonia and at Dolaucothi, and Snowdonia had <b>a</b> <b>flourishing</b> copper industry from the early 1800s. Although exploited in the past, none of these minerals is mined on a commercial scale today.|$|E

5|$|Kentish {{manufacture}} before 600 included glass beakers and jewelry. Kentish jewellers {{were highly}} skilled, {{and before the}} end of the sixth century they gained access to gold. Goods from Kent are found in cemeteries across the channel and as far away as at the mouth of the Loire. It is not known what Kent traded for all of this wealth, although it seems likely that there was <b>a</b> <b>flourishing</b> slave trade. It may well be that this wealth was the foundation of Æthelberht's strength, although his overlordship and the associated right to demand tribute would have brought wealth in its turn.|$|E
5|$|Nablus costume {{was of a}} {{distinctive}} style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics. Due to its position as important trade center with <b>a</b> <b>flourishing</b> souk ("market"), in late 19th century, {{there was a large}} choice of fabrics available in the city, from Damascus and Aleppo silk to Manchester cottons and calicos. Similar in construction to the garments worn in the Galilee, both long and short Turkish style jackets were worn over the thob ("robe"). For daily wear, thobs were often made of white cotton or linen, with a preference for winged sleeves. In the summer, costumes often incorporated interwoven striped bands of red, green and yellow on the front and back, with appliqué and braidwork popularly decorating the qabbeh ("square chest piece").|$|E

5|$|One {{result was}} <b>a</b> <b>flourishing</b> of Scottish Renaissance painted {{ceilings}} and walls in estate houses. These included detailed coloured patterns and scenes, of which {{over a hundred}} examples survive. The designs relied upon continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, as well as elements that called on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory. The earliest example still extant is at the Hamilton palace of Kinneil, West Lothian, decorated in the 1550s for the then regent the James Hamilton, Earl of Arran. Other examples include the ceiling at Prestongrange House, undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr, Commendator of Newbattle, and the long gallery at Pinkie House, painted for Alexander Seaton, Earl of Dunfermline in 1621.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{movement}} were in the British jazz, skiffle and folk movements of the 1950s. The 1958 visit of Muddy Waters influenced key figures Cyril Davies and Alexis Korner to turn to electric blues and form the band Blues Incorporated, which became something of a clearing house for British rhythm and blues musicians. <b>A</b> <b>flourishing</b> scene of clubs and groups emerged in the later 1950s and 1960s and bands began to break through into mainstream success. Major acts included the Rolling Stones, Manfred Mann, The Animals, The Yardbirds, Them, and the Spencer Davis Group, who dominated the UK and US charts from 1964, {{in the wake of}} the Merseybeat craze, becoming central to the mod subculture in the UK and a second wave of British Invasion acts in the US.|$|E
5|$|Trade {{was a key}} {{component}} of Maya society, and {{in the development of the}} Maya civilization. The cities that grew to become the most important usually controlled access to vital trade goods, or portage routes. Cities such as Kaminaljuyu and Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands, and Chalchuapa in El Salvador, variously controlled access to the sources of obsidian at different points in Maya history. The most important cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula controlled access to the sources of salt. In the Postclassic, the Maya engaged in <b>a</b> <b>flourishing</b> slave trade with wider Mesoamerica.|$|E

5|$|Trading {{continued}} {{throughout the}} medieval period {{evidenced by the}} importance of Torksey, which was then <b>a</b> <b>flourishing</b> town, now only a small village. However, the Fossdyke needed much maintenance to keep it clear of silt. Henry I had overseen the scouring of its channel, and there were inquiries in 1335, 1365 and 1518 to consider {{the state of the}} Fossdyke and to compel the inhabitants of the region to maintain it. Lincoln was a centre for the collection of business taxes, but this came at the cost of maintaining the waterways, and having finally decided it was too large a cost, James I presented the Fossdyke to the City of Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|While the {{cultivation}} of grapes and fruit trees supported <b>a</b> <b>flourishing</b> wine industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the effects of Prohibition and a legacy of restrictive laws after its repeal devastated the industry. For 50 years, New Jersey was limited by law to one winery license for every 1,000,000 state residents, which by 1980 effectively allowed for only seven wineries. The growth of the state's winery industry has been bolstered by the 1981 New Jersey Farm Winery Act, which repealed many Prohibition-era laws and allowed many small growers to open new wineries.|$|E
5|$|Importing {{horses for}} use as general {{transportation}} and in army cavalries of Indian kingdoms was <b>a</b> <b>flourishing</b> business on the western seaboard. The forests were harvested for rich woods such as teak which was exported through ports located {{in the area of}} present-day Kerala. Song dynasty records from China mention the presence of Indian merchants in ports of South China, indicating active trade with overseas kingdoms. South India exported textiles, spices, medicinal plants, precious stones, pottery, salt made from salt pans, jewels, gold, ivory, rhino horn, ebony, aloe wood, perfumes, sandalwood, camphor and condiments to China, Dhofar, Aden, and Siraf (the entryport to Egypt, Arabia and Persia). Architects (Vishwakarmas), sculptors, quarry workers, goldsmiths and other skilled craftsmen whose trade directly or indirectly related to temple construction were also prosperous due to the vigorous temple building activities.|$|E
