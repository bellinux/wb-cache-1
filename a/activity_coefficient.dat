25|$|It is {{important}} to note that because the ions in the solution act together, the <b>activity</b> <b>coefficient</b> obtained from this equation is actually a mean <b>activity</b> <b>coefficient.</b>|$|E

25|$|The first {{equilibrium}} lies well to {{the right}} (K ≫ 1) and the second to the left (K ≪ 1), meaning that HF is extensively dissociated, but that the tight ion pairs reduce the thermodynamic <b>activity</b> <b>coefficient</b> of H3O+, so that the solution is effectively less acidic.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{state for}} a dilute solution is also {{defined in terms}} of infinite-dilution behavior. Although the standard concentration c° is taken to be 1mol/l by convention, the standard state is a hypothetical solution of 1mol/l in which the solute has its limiting infinite-dilution properties. This has the effect that all non-ideal behavior is described by the activity coefficient: the <b>activity</b> <b>coefficient</b> at 1mol/l is not necessarily unity (and is frequently quite different from unity).|$|E
25|$|In {{finding the}} {{equilibrium}} state, a geochemical modeler solves for {{the distribution of}} mass of all species, minerals, and gases which can be formed from the basis. This includes the activity, <b>activity</b> <b>coefficient,</b> and concentration of aqueous species, the saturation state of minerals, and the fugacity of gases. Minerals with a saturation index (log Q/K) equal to zero {{are said to be}} in equilibrium with the fluid. Those with positive saturation indices are termed supersaturated, indicating they are favored to precipitate from solution. A mineral is undersaturated if its saturation index is negative, indicating that it is favored to dissolve.|$|E

It is important to understand the mechanics of these interactions for absorber system design. <b>Activity</b> <b>coefficients</b> were determined by use of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet designed for this purpose. It was determined that the length of the ester chain, as well as ester chain saturation had an impact on <b>activity</b> <b>coefficients,</b> in that saturated ester chains and longer ester chains yielded lower <b>activity</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Multiple branched cycloalkanes yielded lower <b>activity</b> <b>coefficients</b> than straight chain hydrocarbons and unbranched cycloalkanes.

Debye and Hückel developed a theory with which single ion <b>activity</b> <b>coefficients</b> could be calculated.

40|$|Dilute-solution {{transport}} equations {{with constant}} <b>activity</b> <b>coefficients</b> {{are commonly used}} to mode] semiconduc-tors. These equations are consistent with a Boltzmann distr ibution and are invalid in regions where the Species concen-tration {{is close to the}} respect ive site concentration. A more rigorous treatment of transport in a semiconductor requires <b>activity</b> <b>coefficients</b> which are functions of concentration. Expressions are presented for <b>activity</b> <b>coefficients</b> of elec-trons and holes in semiconductors for which conduction- and valence-band energy levels are given by the respective bandedge nergy levels. These <b>activity</b> <b>coefficients</b> are functions of concentrat ion and are thermodynamical ly consist-ent. The use of <b>activity</b> <b>coefficients</b> in macroscopic transport relationships allows a description of electron transport {{in a manner consistent with}} the Fermi-Dirac distribution.

25|$|It {{follows that}} any {{equilibrium}} {{of this kind}} can be characterized either by the standard free energy change or by the equilibrium constant. In practice concentrations are more useful than activities. Activities can be calculated from concentrations if the <b>activity</b> <b>coefficient</b> are known, but this is rarely the case. Sometimes activity coefficients can be calculated using, for example, Pitzer equations or Specific ion interaction theory. Otherwise conditions must be adjusted so that activity coefficients do not vary much. For ionic solutions this is achieved by using a background ionic medium at a high concentration relative to the concentrations of the species in equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|Glutathione reductase is a {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and FAD-dependent enzyme, and {{the major}} flavoprotein in erythrocyte. The measurement of the <b>activity</b> <b>coefficient</b> of erythrocyte glutathione reductase (EGR) is the preferred method for assessing riboflavin status. It provides a measure of tissue saturation and long-term riboflavin status. In vitro enzyme activity in terms of activity coefficients (AC) is determined both with and without the addition of FAD to the medium. ACs represent a ratio of the enzyme’s activity with FAD to the enzyme’s activity without FAD. An AC of 1.2 to 1.4, riboflavin status is considered low when FAD is added to stimulate enzyme activity. An AC > 1.4 suggests riboflavin deficiency. On the other hand, if FAD is added and AC is < 1.2, then riboflavin status is considered acceptable. Tillotson and Bashor reported that a decrease in the intakes of riboflavin was associated with increase in EGR AC. In the UK study of Norwich elderly, initial EGR AC values {{for both males and females}} were significantly correlated with those measured 2 years later, suggesting that EGR AC may be a reliable measure of long-term biochemical riboflavin status of individuals. These findings are consistent with earlier studies.|$|E

50|$|An {{empirical}} parameter between {{components that}} describes the intermolecular behaviour. This parameter must be known for all binary pairs in the mixture. In a quaternary mixture there are six such parameters (1-2,1-3,1-4,2-3,2-4,3-4) and the number rapidly increases with additional chemical components. The empirical parameters are derived from experimental <b>activity</b> <b>coefficients,</b> or from phase diagrams, from which the <b>activity</b> <b>coefficients</b> themselves can be calculated. An alternative is to obtain <b>activity</b> <b>coefficients</b> with a method such as UNIFAC, and the UNIFAC parameters can then be simplified by fitting to obtain the UNIQUAC parameters. This method allows for the more rapid calculation of <b>activity</b> <b>coefficients,</b> rather than direct usage of the more complex method.|$|R

It was found that, with the exception of cyclopentadiene, alkene <b>activity</b> <b>coefficients</b> decreased slightly with increasing temperature thereby generally deviating from ideality. Solubility of alkyne interactions with unsaturated esters increased with increasing temperature, but decreased with saturated ester interactions for the terminal alkynes. With the exception of trichloromethane halogenated alkane <b>activity</b> <b>coefficients</b> decreased with increasing temperature, thus deviating from ideality.

Several engineering models were tested for their ability-to predict the <b>activity</b> <b>coefficients</b> in these nearly athermal systems.
