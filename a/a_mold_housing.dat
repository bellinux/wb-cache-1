40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of the aircraft onboard cables design made by the authors has shown that it is most expedient to reduce {{the weight of the}} bonding of electrical connectors through replacing <b>a</b> <b>molded</b> <b>housing</b> of the plug connector by a lightweight one, while keeping to the requirements of shielding the cable bonding assembly from radio interference. 0. 15 รท 0. 2 mm thick aluminum foil was chosen as a material for the tubular lightweight housing. To obtain lightweight tubular products for space engineering it was suggested to use magnetic impulse welding-forming (MIWF), which applies integrated force and thermal action on the workpiece. We described the physical nature of MIWF process and defined the ranges of energy parameters affecting the quality of welded joints: operating voltage of the battery charge of capacitors, capacity of the equipment storage unit, inductance of the working tool - inductor - characterized by a number of turns. The combination of these parameters determines the energy and the duration of the action to the workpiece. The results of the experimental studies are provided. The industrial technology has been developed...|$|R
5000|$|The device {{consists}} of <b>a</b> <b>molded</b> plastic <b>housing</b> that {{attaches to the}} end of an electrical conduit that carries the underground cables up the utility pole to the crossarm. Multiple bushing insulators project from the plastic body, each ending at an electrical terminal. Each overhead wire is connected to a bushing terminal from which the current passes through a rod {{down the center of the}} bushing to the interior of the housing, where it is connected to a wire from the conduit. Thus the device allows the overhead conductors to pass into the conduit while serving as a seal to keep out water. The purpose of the bushings, which have corrugations moulded into their surfaces, is to provide enough creepage distance along their surface to prevent leakage current from the high voltage terminal from flowing to the grounded metal conduit.|$|R
5000|$|Lonaconing Furnace, {{also known}} as The George's Creek Coal and Iron Company Furnace No. 1, is a {{historic}} iron furnace in Lonaconing, Allegany County, Maryland, United States. It is a truncated square pyramid constructed of sandstone, 50 ft high, 50 feet square at the base, and 25 feet square at the top. It first produced iron in 1839, then the iron operation was abandoned in the mid-1850s, the Loncaconing Furnace complex included <b>a</b> top <b>house,</b> <b>molding</b> <b>house,</b> engine house, and two hot-air furnaces for heating the blast. None of these ancillary structures remains. It {{played a significant role}} in demonstrating that both coke and raw bituminous coal could be used as fuels in the manufacture of iron. It is known as [...] "the first coke furnace, whose operation was successful, erected in this country." ...|$|R
50|$|The phone {{consisted}} of a rotary dial, a handset cradle, switch hook, and a handset (sometimes called the receiver) wired to the base, and was constructed of <b>a</b> <b>molded</b> plastic <b>housing</b> covering <b>a</b> steel chassis. The user interface {{consisted of}} only the dial and switch hook buttons. No other components, switches, or controls were necessary, {{with the exception of}} a loudness control for the ringer, which was accessible on the bottom of the phone. The handset cradle was <b>a</b> <b>molded</b> part of the housing, formed of two U-shaped chairs which cradled the handle of the handset between the receiver and the transmitter cups. Each side of the cradle had a round plastic plunger positioned above a pair of levers connected in a spring-loaded yoke that operated the hook switch; pressing the plungers down ended the call and placed the phone on-hook. The plastic face of the dial under and surrounding the finger wheel was an integral part of the dial assembly and was exposed through a large circular opening in the housing. On the bottom, the flat steel plate of the chassis was exposed. The handset cord exited from the left side of the housing at the base, and the line cord emerged from the rear at the base.|$|R
40|$|Purpose:Many studies {{demonstrate}} that DOE, CAE and optimization tools {{can be very}} effective in product and process development, however their integration is still under investigation, hampering the applicability of such engineering methods in Industry. This paper presents a Design Of Simulation Experiments (DOSE) method, developed to determine the optimal set of process parameters (factors) for given product requirements (responses). Method:The method is developed performing an original selection and integration of engineering procedures and techniques based on DOE, CAE and multi-objective optimization, chosen according to the following criteria: ease of application, time-saving and use of reduced resources. Result:The developed method consists of two main steps: a first screening of factors based on a fractional DOE {{is followed by a}} systematic experimental plan based on the Response Surface Methodology (RSM), in which only key factors are investigated. A regression model is finally developed to describe the responses as functions of key factors and a multi-objective optimization is proposed to obtain optimal responses by tuning the process factors in their variability range. The DOSE method is finally validated on the design of <b>an</b> injection <b>molded</b> <b>housing</b> for <b>a</b> biomedical application. This thin shell component has dimension 45 mmx 37 mmx 16 mm, wall thickness from 2 mm to 0, 5 mm and is made of polyphenylsulfone (PPSU), a high performance thermoplastic. Discussion & Conclusion:The design method achieves good responses in terms of dimensional and geometrical requirements (e. g. warpage, shrinkage, sink marks), and improves the shell moldability. The DOSE method can be easily adopted in industrial product/process development to define the optimal process parameters for a better final quality of the products...|$|R

40|$|A {{document}} {{discusses the}} creation of a high-voltage power supply (HVPS) that is able to contain voltages up to - 20 kV, keep electrical field strengths to below 200 V/mil (approximately equal to 7. 87 kV/mm), and can provide a 200 -nanosecond rise/fall time focus modulator swinging between cathode potential of 16. 3 kV and - 19. 3 kV. This HVPS can protect the 95 -GHz, pulsed extended interaction klystron (EIK) from arcs/discharges from all sources, including those from within the EIK fs vacuum envelope. This innovation has a multi-winding pulse transformer design, which uses new winding techniques to provide the same delays and rise/fall times (less than 10 nanoseconds) at different potential levels ranging from - 20 kV to - 16 kV. Another feature involves a high-voltage printed-wiring board that was corona-free at - 20 kV DC with a 3 - kV AC swing. The corona-free multilayer high-voltage board is used to simulate fields of less than 200 V/mil (approximately equal to 7. 87 kV/mm) at 20 kV DC. Drive techniques for the modulator FETs (field-effect transistors) (four to 10 in a series) were created to change states (3, 000 -V swing) without abrupt steps, while still maintaining required delays and transition times. The packing scheme includes <b>a</b> potting <b>mold</b> to <b>house</b> <b>a</b> ten-stage modulator in the space that, in the past, only housed a four-stage modulator. Problems keeping heat down were solved using aluminum oxide substrate in the high-voltage section to limit temperature rise to less than 10 while withstanding - 20 kV DC voltage and remaining corona-free...|$|R

50|$|While {{the exact}} method for {{production}} of beveled rim bowls is unknown, {{the most widely}} accepted theory {{is the use of}} <b>a</b> <b>mold.</b> <b>A</b> lesser accepted theory is that the bowls were made by hand. Archeologists replicating beveled rim bowls have found it considerably difficult to achieve the straight sides and well defined base while only using their hands. The use of <b>a</b> <b>mold</b> {{has been found to be}} a significant advantage when replicating the bowls. The large numbers of beveled rim bowls found (often in a single site) seem to support the mold theory because mass production with <b>a</b> <b>mold</b> is far more feasible than making them by hand. A debate exists among advocates of the mold theory. Most impose the use of <b>a</b> mobile <b>mold</b> that could be made of a variety of materials including wood, metal, stone or even another beveled rim bowl. Others suggest that craftsmen would have used <b>a</b> ground <b>mold</b> wherein the bowls were formed in a conical depression created in the ground.|$|R
