40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole (<b>aminotriazole)</b> {{competitively}} inhibits {{the activity}} of imidazoleglycerolphosphate dehydratase, {{the product of the}} HIS 3 gene.

However, strains containing gcn 4 mutations are unable to grow in medium containing <b>aminotriazole</b> because they lack the GCN 4 transcriptional activator protein necessary for the coordinate induction of HIS 3 and other amino acid biosynthetic genes. Here, we isolated a new gene, designated ATR 1, which when present in multiple copies per cell allowed gcn 4 mutant strains to grow in the presence of <b>aminotriazole.</b> In wild-type strains, multiple copies of ATR 1 permitted growth at extremely high concentrations of <b>aminotriazole</b> (80 mM), whereas a chromosomal deletion of ATR 1 caused growth inhibition at very low concentrations (5 mM). When radioactive <b>aminotriazole</b> was added exogenously, cells with multiple copies of ATR 1 accumulated less <b>aminotriazole</b> than wild-type cells, whereas cells with the atr 1 deletion mutation retained more <b>aminotriazole.</b> Unlike the mammalian mdr or yeast PDR genes that confer resistance to many drugs, ATR 1 appears to confer resistance only to <b>aminotriazole.</b> Genetic analysis, mRNA mapping, and DNA sequencing revealed that (i) the primary translation product of ATR 1 contains 547 amino acids, (ii) ATR 1 transcription is induced by <b>aminotriazole,</b> and (iii) the ATR 1 promoter region contains a binding site for the GCN 4 activator protein.

40|$|Recent studies {{involved}} acetaldehyde, {{the first}} ethanol metabolite, {{in both the}} rewarding and aversive effects of ethanol consumption. Brain acetaldehyde is believed to originate mainly from local brain metabolism of ethanol by the enzyme catalase. Therefore, the inhibition of catalase by 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole (<b>aminotriazole)</b> may help to clarify the involvement of acetaldehyde in ethanol's hedonic effects. In the present study, multiple doses of both ethanol and <b>aminotriazole</b> were used to investigate the effects of catalase inhibition on ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA). A separate microdialysis experiment investigated the effects of <b>aminotriazole</b> pretreatment on {{the time course of}} brain ethanol concentrations. Ethanol induced a dose-dependent CTA with a maximal effect after conditioning with 2. 0 g/kg ethanol. <b>Aminotriazole</b> pretreatments dose-dependently potentiated the CTA induced by 1. 0 g/kg ethanol. However, <b>aminotriazole</b> pretreatments did not alter the CTA induced by higher ethanol doses (1. 5 and 2. 0 g/kg) probably because a maximal aversion for saccharin was already obtained without <b>aminotriazole.</b> The results of the microdialysis experiment confirmed that the effects of <b>aminotriazole</b> cannot be attributed to local alterations of brain ethanol levels. The present study argues against a role for brain acetaldehyde in ethanol's aversive effects but in favor of its involvement in ethanol rewarding properties. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Seedlings {{of tobacco}} (Nicotiana sylvestris) were treated in vivo with 0. 03 to 20 millimolar 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole (<b>aminotriazole).</b> There was a rapid loss of {{catalase}} (EC 1. 11. 1. 6) activity {{over the first}} 5 hours followed by a slower decrease for the next 4 hours to a level that was 15 to 20 % of the initial activity, {{with little or no}} change for periods up to 3 days. Fifty percent loss of catalase activity occurred at 0. 10 to 0. 15 millimolar inhibitor (18 -hour incubation). The isozymes of tobacco catalase differed in sensitivity to the inhibitor. Enhanced-peroxidatic catalase (EP-CAT) (Havir EA, McHale NA, [1989] Plant Physiol 91 : 812 - 815) decreased 35 % under conditions in which the major isozyme decreased 85 %. The resistance to <b>aminotriazole</b> inhibition demonstrated in vivo by EP-CAT was also observed in vitro. The times for 50 % inhibition at 0. 67, 3. 33, 5. 0, 10. 0, and 15 millimolar <b>aminotriazole</b> were 15, 5, 2. 6, 2. 5, and 1. 5 minutes, respectively, for the major isozyme of catalase and 60, 18. 5, 5. 1, 4, and 3. 0 minutes, respectively, for EP-CAT.

40|$|Studies were {{performed}} to elucidate {{the nature of the}} pathway of hepatic thyroxine (T 4) metabolism that is activated by inhibitors of liver catalase. For this purpose, the metabolism of T 4 in homogenates of rat liver was monitored with T 4 labeled with 125 I either at the 5 '-position of the outer-ring (125 I-beta-T 4) or uniformly in both the outer and inner rings (125 I-U-T 4). In homogenates incubated with 125 I-beta-T 4 in an atmosphere of O 2, the catalase inhibitor <b>aminotriazole</b> greatly enhanced T 4 degradation, promoting the formation of large proportions of 125 I-labeled iodide (125 I-I-) and chromatographically immobile origin material (125 I-OM), but only a minute proportion of 125 I-labeled 3, 5, 3 '-triiodothyronine (125 I-T 3) (T 3 neogenesis). In an atmosphere of N 2, in contrast, homogenates produced much larger proportions of 125 I-T 3, and <b>aminotriazole</b> had no effect. In incubations with 125 I-U-T 4, under aerobic conditions, control homogenates degraded T 4 slowly; formation of 125 I-labeled 3, 5 -diiodotyrosine (125 I-DIT) was seen only occasionally and in minute proportions. However, in homogenates incubated under O 2, but not N 2, <b>aminotriazole</b> consistently elicited the formation of large proportions of 125 I-DIT, indicating that the ether link of T 4 was being cleaved by an O 2 -dependent process. Formation of 125 I-DIT in the presence of <b>aminotriazole</b> and O 2 was markedly inhibited by the substrates of peroxidase, aminoantipyrine, and guaiacol. GSH greatly attenuated the increase in DIT formation induced by <b>aminotriazole,</b> whereas the sulfhydryl inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) activated the DIT-generating pathway, {{even in the absence of}} <b>aminotriazole.</b> Activation of the in vitro formation of 125 I-DIT from 125 I-U-T 4 was also produced by the in vivo administration of <b>aminotriazole</b> or bacterial endotoxin, an agent that reduces hepatic catalase activity. Studies with 125 I-DIT as substrate revealed it to be rapidly deiodinated by liver homogenates under aerobic conditions. Recovery of 125 I-DIT from 125 I-U-T 4 was increased by the addition of the inhibitor of iodotyrosine dehalogenase, 3, 5 -dinitrotyrosine. However, as judged from studies conducted in parallel with radioiodine-labeled DIT and 125 I-U-T 4 as substrates, none of the factors that altered the proportion of 125 I-DIT found after incubations with 125 I-U-T 4 did so by altering the degradation of the 125 I-DIT formed. The factors that influenced DIT formation from T 4 in rat liver had opposite effects on T 3 neogenesis. Thus, <b>aminotriazole,</b> endotoxin, NEM, and an aerobic atmosphere, all of which enhanced DIT formation, were inhibitory to T 3 neogenesis. In contrast, anaerobiosis and GSH inhibited ether-link cleavage of T 4, but facilitated T 3 neogenesis. The foregoing results suggest that a pathway for the ether-link cleavage of T 4 to yield DIT is present in rat liver. Activity of this pathway, which appears to be peroxidase mediated, is inversely related to activity of the pathway for the T 3 neogenesis. It is further suggested that this reciprocity reflects a reciprocal relationship between hepatic GSH and H 2 O 2, the former increasing T 3 formation and inhibiting DIT formation, and the latter producing opposite effects...|$|E
40|$|After benzyl viologen {{administration}} to rats, {{a decrease in}} the rat liver glutamine synthetase activity was observed.

Moreover, partially purified glutamine synthetase from rat liver underwent rapid inactivation upon aerobic incubation with NAD(P) H and benzyl viologen. This inactivation was prevented by catalase, which suggests that the NAD(P) H/BV 2 +/O 2 -dependent system has a role in H 2 O 2 production. Our results suggest that H 2 O 2 is involved in the benzyl viologen-mediated in-vivo inactivation of the rat liver glutamine synthetase.

40|$|A {{system based}} on Arabidopsis thaliana {{suspension}} cultures was established {{for the analysis of}} glutathione (GSH) synthesis in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Mild oxidative stress was induced by use of the catalase inhibitor, <b>aminotriazole,</b> and its development was monitored by measurement of the oxidative inactivation of aconitase. Addition of 2 mM <b>aminotriazole</b> resulted in a 25 % decrease in activity of aconitase over 4 h. During the subsequent 10 h, no further decrease in aconitase activity was measured despite a sustained inhibition of catalase. In combination with our failure to detect significant increases in the level of lipid peroxidation, another marker indicative of oxidative injury, these data suggest that although hydrogen peroxide initially leaked into the cytosol, its accumulation was limited by a cytosolic catalase-independent mechanism. A 4 -fold increase in the level of GSH, which was almost exclusively in the reduced form, was observed under the same treatment. To determine to what extent this increase in reduced GSH played a role in limiting the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in the cytosol, we inhibited GSH synthesis with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a specific inhibitor of [gamma]-glutamylcysteine synthetase. No significant oxidative injury was detected as a result of treatment with 50 [mu]M BSO alone, and furthermore, this treatment had no effect on cell viability, However, addition of 2 mM <b>aminotriazole</b> to cells preincubated with 50 [mu]M BSO for 15 h led to a rapid loss of aconitase activity (75 % in 4 h), and significant accumulation of products of lipid peroxidation. Within 72 h, cell viability was lost completely. After removal of BSO from the growth medium, GSH levels recovered to normal over a period of 20 h. Addition of 2 mM <b>aminotriazole</b> to cells at different time points during this recovery period demonstrated a strong correlation between the level of reduced GSH and the degree of protection against oxidative injury. These data strongly suggest that the induction of GSH synthesis by an oxidative stimulus plays a crucial role in determining the susceptibility of cells to oxidative stress...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the influence of antioxidant system on the contraction of arteries induced by angiotensin II during ischemia/reperfusion and to determine the role of intracellular and extracellular calcium ions under these conditions. Material/Methods:The experiments were performed on male Wistar rats’ tail arteries. The effects of angiotensin II on vascular tone were examined after ischemia/reperfusion in the presence of catalase or <b>aminotriazole.</b> To determine the role of intracellular and extracellular Ca[sup] 2 [/sup], the experiments were performed in Ca[sup] 2 [/sup]-free PSS and PSS. Results:Angiotensin II increased perfusion pressure in both Ca[sup] 2 [/sup]-free PSS and PSS. After ischemia, the reactions induced by angiotensin II were lower, while after reperfusion they were higher. In the presence of catalase the effects induced by angiotensin II were lower and in the presence of <b>aminotriazole</b> higher. Conclusions:Ischemia inhibits and reperfusion augments the perfusion pressure induced by angiotensin II. The results confirm the vasoprotective effect of catalase and the destructive influence of <b>aminotriazole</b> in modulating the reactions of vascular smooth muscle cells to ANG II after ischemia/reperfusion. These results suggest that the antioxidant system plays a role in modulating the reactions induced by angiotensin II after ischemia/reperfusion and that reperfusion disturbs the balance between antioxidants and the production of reactive oxygen species...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} intact human red cells to {{scavenge}} extracellularly generated H 2 O 2 and O 2 -, {{and to prevent}} formation of hydroxyl radicals and hypochlorous acid has been examined. Red cells inhibited oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by H 2 O 2. Cells treated with <b>aminotriazole</b> no longer inhibited, indicating that protection was almost entirely due to intracellular catalase. Contribution by the GSH system was slight, and apparent only with low H 2 O 2 concentrations when catalase was inhibited by <b>aminotriazole.</b> The cells were about a quarter as efficient at inhibiting cytochrome c oxidation as an equivalent concentration of purified catalase. No inhibition of O 2 (-) -dependent reduction of ferricytochrome c or nitroblue tetrazolium was observed, although extracted red cell superoxide dismutase inhibited nitroblue tetrazolium reduction at one fortieth the concentration {{of that in the}} cells. Red cells efficiently inhibited deoxyribose oxidation by hydroxyl radicals generated from H 2 O 2, O 2 - and Fe(EDTA), and myeloperoxidase-dependent oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide by stimulated neutrophils.

Therefore, we hypothesized that acetaldehyde might be ultimately responsible for the activation of this intracellular pathway. We used three pharmacological agents that modify acetaldehyde activity (α-lipoic acid, <b>aminotriazole,</b> and d-penicillamine) to study the role of this metabolite on EtOH-induced PKA activation in mice. Our results show that the injection of α-lipoic acid, <b>aminotriazole</b> and d-penicillamine prior to acute EtOH administration effectively blocks the PKA-enhanced response to EtOH in the brain.

Illumination of excised barley, tobacco, and soybean plants for 8 hours in solution containing 2 millimolar <b>aminotriazole</b> (a catalase inhibitor) {{resulted in an}} increase in leaf glutathione from 250 to 400 nanomoles per gram fresh weight to 600 to 1800 nanomoles per gram fresh weight, depending on the species tested. All of this increase could be accounted for as oxidized glutathione. Between 25 and 50 % of this oxidized glutathione was reduced when plants were darkened for 16 hours, but there was no significant decline in total glutathione. Another catalase inhibitor, thiosemicarbazide, was as effective as <b>aminotriazole</b> in elevating glutathione in soybean but was less effective in barley and tobacco. Glyphosate, an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, had no significant effect on glutathione levels in any of the plants examined. Whereas methyl viologen (paraquat), which is a sink for photosystem I electrons, caused oxidation of leaf glutathione in all of the plants but did not increase the total amount of glutathione present...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{aggregation}} of platelets {{induced by}} soluble and particulate stimuli {{is enhanced by}} the addition of minute amounts of H 2 O 2. Externally added catalase strongly inhibits the aggregation induced by particulate stimuli and by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The addition of <b>aminotriazole</b> to stimulated platelets causes a significant inhibition of intracellular catalase. This indicates the formation of H 2 O 2 inside the platelets during activation. No effects were observed when the platelets were stimulated by the ionophore A 23187...|$|E
40|$|The {{secretion}} of H 2 O 2 by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and M. gallisepticum {{was measured}} with the new catalase-aminotriazole method. Peroxide secretion by the mycoplasmas was stimulated by glucose. When catalase and <b>aminotriazole</b> were omitted and exogenous H 2 O 2 {{was added to the}} mycoplasmas, a loss in H 2 O 2 was noted with time; the addition of glucose speeded the disappearance of H 2 O 2. The presence of this peroxidase-like activity in the mycoplasmas explains an observed failure of H 2 O 2 to accumulate freely in the suspension medium...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} {{steady state}} levels of 5 micromolar were determined in soybean (Glycine max) embryonic axes incubated for 2 hours and in axes pretreated with <b>aminotriazole</b> or cyanide, where these levels were 50 and 1 micromolar, respectively. The activities of catalase (105 picomoles H 2 O 2 per minute per axis), peroxidase (10 - 44 picomoles H 2 O 2 per minute per axis), glutathione peroxidase (3 picomoles H 2 O 2 per minute per axis) and superoxide dismutase (3. 5 units per axis), were also determined. Catalase {{seems to be}} the most important H 2 O 2 consuming enzyme at the physiological concentration of H 2 O 2. A short treatment with <b>aminotriazole,</b> while substantially increasing H 2 O 2 level, did not affect the growth of the axes. The production of superoxide anion by the mitochondria isolated from soybean axes was measured from the superoxide dismutase-sensitive rate of adrenochrome formation in the presence of NADH or succinate as substrate and amounted to 1. 3 and 0. 8 nanomole O 2 − per minute per milligram protein, respectively. According to the stoichiometry of O 2 − and H 2 O 2 dismutation reactions, it is apparent that about 0. 9 to 1. 5 % of the total oxygen uptake proceeds through the formation of the free intermediates of the partial reduction of oxygen...|$|E
40|$|Leaves of rye {{seedlings}} (Secale cereale L.) {{grown in}} the presence of four chlorosis-inducing herbicides under a low light intensity of 10 lux formed chlorophyll. When segments of such dim-light-grown leaves were exposed to 30, 000 lux at either 0 °C or 30 °C, treatments with <b>aminotriazole</b> or haloxidine (group 1) showed no or only minor changes of their chlorophyll contents. In treatments with San 6706 or difunon (group 2), however, rapid photodestruction of chlorophyll occurred both at 0 °C and at 30 °C and was accompanied by an increase of malondialdehyde that was not seen {{in the presence of}} group 1 herbicides. Unlike the in vivo behavior, virtually equal rates of chlorophyll breakdown were observed for <b>aminotriazole</b> and San 6706 treatments in suspensions of isolated chloroplasts from 10 lux-grown leaves after exposure to strong light. The free radical scavengers p-benzoquinone and hydroquinone and the d-penicillamine copper complex exerting superoxide dismutating activity effectively prevented photooxidation of chlorophyll in 10 lux-grown herbicide-treated leaf segments or even restored an accumulation of chlorophyll at 30, 000 lux. Ascorbate and several singlet oxygen or hydroxyl radical scavengers had no protective effects. Deuterium oxide and H 2 O 2 did not enhance the degradation of chlorophyll. Superoxide dismutase activity was decreased in leaves bleached in the presence of group 2 herbicides...|$|E
40|$|Aspects {{of direct}} laser desorption/ionisation {{have been studied}} for three molecules, <b>aminotriazole</b> (positive ion), {{dinoterb}} and ioxynil (negative ion). The samples are deposited on metallic substrates, and a nitrogen laser is used for desorption/ionisation; ion yields are measured with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, Previous work had shown that ion yields can strongly vary from one substrate to another, and that this variation {{does not reflect the}} (calculated) metal surface temperatures. New results obtained in this work indicate that the desorption/ionisation mechanism is linked to the physical state of the substrate surface. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|We have {{previously}} reported {{a method for}} isolation of mutants with enhanced tolerance to the fungal AAL toxin and given a detailed characterization of atr 1 (AAL toxin resistant). Herewith, we report eight more mutants with enhanced tolerance to the AAL toxin. Phenotypic analysis showed that six of the mutants were reduced in size compared with their original background loh 2. Furthermore, atr 2 showed delayed flowering and senescence. The mutants were also evaluated for oxidative stress tolerance by growing them on ROS-inducing media supplemented with either <b>aminotriazole</b> or paraquat, generating, respectively, H 2 O 2 or superoxide radicals. Oxidative stress, confirmed by induction of the marker genes, HIGH AFFINITY NITRATE TRANSPORTER At 1 G 08090 and HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 17 At 3 G 46230, inhibited growth of all lines. However, while the original background loh 2 developed necrotic lesions and died rapidly on ROS-inducing plant growth media, atr 1, atr 2, atr 7 and atr 9 remained green and viable. The tolerance against oxidative stress-induced cell death was confirmed by fresh weight and chlorophyll measurements. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that {{the expression of the}} EXTENSIN gene At 5 G 46890, previously shown to be downregulated by <b>aminotriazole</b> in atr 1, was repressed in all lines, consistent with the growth inhibition induced by oxidative stress. Taken together, the data indicate a complex link between growth, development and oxidative stress tolerance and indicates that growth inhibition can be uncoupled from oxidative stress-induced cell death. ...|$|E
40|$|Seedlings of Triticum aestivum L. and Secale cereale L. {{were grown}} in the {{presence}} of six different (five having different chemical structures) chlorosis-inducing herbicides: <b>aminotriazole</b> and its derivative SDR 5175, haloxidine, Sandoz 6706, fluometuron, and EMD-IT 5914. Concentrations were applied which allowed the leaves to grow normally and to reach normal total amino nitrogen contents but evoked a complete chlorosis (less than 6 % chlorophyll). The effects of the herbicides on the accumulation of several chloroplast constituents and on peroxisomal and mitochondrial marker enzyme activities were compared. Wheat and rye, in general, gave very similar results, wheat being more sensitive to unspecific inhibitory effects...|$|E
