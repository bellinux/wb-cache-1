50|$|There {{is usually}} an <b>antenna</b> <b>matching</b> unit {{to match the}} {{impedance}} of the transmitter or feeder to the antenna.

A single, typical, commercially available balun can cover frequencies from 3.5 - 30.0 MHz, or nearly the entire shortwave radio band.

Antenna coupling or feedline matching circuits are also narrowband for any single setting, but can be re-tuned more conveniently. However they are perhaps the least efficient in terms of power-loss (aside from having no impedance matching at all!).|$|E

5000|$|A {{variometer}} {{is a type}} of {{continuously variable}} air-core RF inductor with two windings. [...] One common form consisted of a coil wound on a short hollow cylindrical form, with a second smaller coil inside, mounted on a shaft so its magnetic axis can be rotated with respect to the outer coil. The two coils are connected in series. When the two coils are collinear, with their magnetic fields pointed in the same direction, the two magnetic fields add, and the inductance is maximum. If the inner coil is rotated so its axis is at an angle to the outer coil, the magnetic fields do not add and the inductance is less. If the inner coil is rotated so it is collinear with the outer coil but their magnetic fields point in opposite directions, the fields cancel each other out and the inductance is very small or zero. The advantage of the variometer is that inductance can be adjusted continuously, over a wide range. Variometers were widely used in 1920s radio receivers. One of their main uses today is as <b>antenna</b> <b>matching</b> coils to match longwave radio transmitters to their antennas.|$|E
