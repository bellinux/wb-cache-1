5|$|In North America, X-Men {{opened on}} Friday, July 14, 2000, and made $20.8 million on its opening day. The film earned $54.5 {{million in its}} opening weekend, {{averaging}} $18,007 per theater, and having the highest-grossing opening weekend for a superhero film (surpassing Batman Forevers $52.7 million), a non-sequel and a July release (surpassing Men in Blacks $51.1 million). At {{the time of its}} release, X-Men had the sixth biggest opening of all time and marked {{the first time in history}} that three pictures had consecutive opening weekends above $40 million in North America, after The Perfect Storms $41.3 million <b>and</b> <b>Scary</b> Movies $42.3 million.|$|E
5|$|IGN's Chloi Rad commended the game's {{blend of}} drama and action, {{as well as}} the {{realistic}} depiction of violence, and felt that the game's setting and period helped demonstrate the spirit of the revolution. Andrew Todd of Gameplanet praised the game's manner of dealing with issues like inequality, theocracy, and causes of anti-Americanism, and noted that they help create the atmosphere of the story and setting. Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef found the narrative's moral ambiguity refreshing, particularly the depiction of corrupting good people. He felt that the development team being primarily Iranian added to the game's authenticity. Kotakus Evan Narcisse similarly appreciated the ambiguity, noting its close imitation to the era. The choices presented in the game split reviewers; some found them important <b>and</b> <b>scary,</b> while others found them ultimately inconsequential.|$|E

None {{of these differences}} get in their way of being close neighbours. But {{if you really want}} to know Hairies <b>and</b> <b>Scaries</b> all you have to do is meet Willow and Constance. They’re two regular kids in an irregular world. Willow’s a Hairy boy and Constance is a Scary girl. Willow loves adventure and greets each day with enthusiasm. Constance loves having a plan and likes to stick to the rules. Willow is always getting himself in trouble and Constance is always getting him out of it. Which makes Junior very, very unhappy. Junior is a scheming Scary classmate who is totally enamoured with Constance. He sees Willow as a rival for her heart (even though she can’t stand him) and he works tirelessly to find ways to embarrass and thwart Willow. Naturally, he never wins. Will he ever learn? ...|$|R

25|$|Nicola Cuti made {{creative}} {{improvements to}} Charlton's {{line in the}} early 1970s Bronze Age of comic books as assistant editor under George Wildman, who was occupied primarily with administrative duties. Cuti brought Mike Zeck, among others, into Charlton's roster of artists, and his writing enlivened the Ghostly titles, now including Ghostly Haunts. Other Bronze Age Charlton horror titles included Haunted, Midnight Tales, <b>and</b> <b>Scary</b> Tales.|$|E
25|$|The {{style of}} the Moomin books changed as time went by. The first books, up to Moominland Midwinter (1957), are {{adventure}} stories that include floods, comets and supernatural events. The Moomins and the Great Flood deals with Moominmamma and Moomintroll's flight through a dark <b>and</b> <b>scary</b> forest, where they encounter various dangers. In Comet in Moominland, a comet nearly destroys the Moominvalley (some critics have considered this an allegory of nuclear weapons). Finn Family Moomintroll deals with adventures {{brought on by the}} discovery of a magician's hat. The Exploits of Moominpappa (1950) tells the story of Moominpappa's adventurous youth and cheerfully parodies the genre of memoirs. Finally, Moominsummer Madness (1955) pokes fun at the world of the theatre: the Moomins explore an empty theatre and perform Moominpappa's pompous hexametric melodrama.|$|E
25|$|Chenfrault's {{first film}} soundtrack work was on Celebration, which was {{directed}} by Olivier Meyrou. A documentary film about Yves Saint Laurent, Celebration was blocked from distribution by Pierre Bergé. Chanfrault composed the music for the 2003 film Haute Tension, which {{was directed by}} Alexandre Aja. Cinezik noted Chanfrault created a strident <b>and</b> <b>scary</b> atmosphere on the film's soundtrack. Who Killed Bambi? directed by Gilles Marchand, featured compositions by Chanfrault and was released {{in the same year}} as Haute Tension. He composed the music for the 2005 film Beyond Hatred, which was directed by Olivier Meyrou. His work on the film was well received; a review by Variety praised François-Eudes Chanfrault's sparse, sorrowful, string-based score. Chanfrault's work on the music for the 2006 film The Hills Have Eyes directed by Alexandre Aja inspired the tone for the 2011 documentary Après la gauche by filmmaker Jeremy Forni.|$|E

500|$|In addition, CGI {{was used}} for the lions and deer in the film, and to erase {{pedestrians}} in shots of New York. Workers visible in windows, spectators, and moving cars in the distance were all removed. In his vision of an empty New York, Lawrence cited John Ford as his influence: [...] "We didn't want to make an apocalyptic movie where the landscape felt apocalyptic. A lot of the movie takes place on a beautiful day. There's something magical about the empty city as opposed to dark <b>and</b> <b>scary</b> that was the ideal that the cast and crew wanted." ...|$|E

500|$|Julia Keller, {{a critic}} for the Chicago Tribune, {{highlighted}} the humour found in the novel and claimed {{it to be the}} success of the Harry Potter saga. She acknowledged that [...] "the books are dark <b>and</b> <b>scary</b> in places" [...] but [...] "no darkness in Half-Blood Prince...is so immense that it cannot be rescued by a snicker or a smirk." [...] She considered that Rowling was suggesting that difficult times could be worked through with imagination, hope, and humour, and compared this concept to works such as Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time and Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{theme of}} sexual violence, {{of what it}} means to be a man, is a big part of that episode," [...] creator Matthew Weiner said of [...] "Mystery Date".

Of the dream sequence, Hamm said, [...] "Unlike a lot of things on our show, it's very visceral and immediate <b>and</b> <b>scary</b> and weird" [...] with Hamm noting that Weiner compared the episode to a horror film.

500|$|The Nightmare Before Christmas {{originated}} {{in a poem}} written by Tim Burton in 1982, while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation. With the success of Vincent in the same year, Walt Disney Studios began to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute television special. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project, and in 1990, he made a development deal with Disney. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; Disney released the film through its Touchstone Pictures banner because the studio believed the film would be [...] "too dark <b>and</b> <b>scary</b> for kids".|$|E

500|$|Critics {{agreed that}} the episode was the most gothic <b>and</b> <b>scary</b> of the series, with journalists writing for The Sunday Times saying that [...] "The Harrowing" [...] would be best avoided by those of a nervous disposition. Critics writing in the Metro felt that the episode was a poor finale for the series, and that the episode's ending was unsatisfying. By contrast, Alex Hoskins, writing for the Cheddar Valley Gazette, felt the episode's ending was very strong, and Bruce Dessau {{described}} [...] "The Harrowing" [...] as an excellent end to the series. On an Empire Online list, [...] "The Harrowing", particularly its final scene, {{was selected as the}} 17th best TV moment of the year. The episode was watched by 833,000 people on its first showing, which was 4.7% of the audience.|$|E
500|$|Disney {{decided to}} release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner because they thought the film would be [...] "too dark <b>and</b> <b>scary</b> for kids", Selick remembered. [...] "Their biggest fear, and why {{it was kind of}} a stepchild project, [...] they were afraid of their core {{audience}} hating the film and not coming." [...] To convey Burton's' involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Burton explained that,"...it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I'm not quite sure about." [...] The film premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, and was given a limited release on October 15, 1993, before its wide theatrical release on October 29.|$|E
500|$|Mary Pols of Time {{magazine}} called the film entertaining and reasoned [...] "here {{is a lot}} of intelligent camp here, and some sharply observed characterizations" [...] and Cody and Kusama's [...] "depiction {{of the ways in which}} women like Needy are willing to compromise themselves to indulge an ultimately less secure friend is spot-on". Dana Stevens of Slate praised the film for being [...] "luscious and powerful, sexy <b>and</b> <b>scary,</b> maddening at times, but impossible to stop watching" [...] and a [...] "wicked black comedy with unexpected emotional resonance, one of the most purely pleasurable movies of the year so far". Elle's Karen Durbin said the film not only puts [...] "a fresh spin on female-centric pop genres but also own them outright" [...] and is [...] "rich with first-rate performances".|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{were more}} {{critical}} concerning the game's sound. Although {{the quality of}} the musical compositions was praised, both RPGFan and RPGamer found that there were too few adequately long tracks, with mediocre ambient sound effects to fill the dead time, <b>and</b> <b>Scary</b> Larry complained of the player character's dog [...] "constantly" [...] barking. Super Play and GamePro both found that the game was not up to the standards held by other Square games. Others argued that Secret of Evermore was a decent first attempt by the American team. Game Players anticipated another game from the same development team, and a critic for Next Generation said that while the game suffered from a number of amateur mistakes, [...] "as a debut title for a new team of designers, it points to a rosy future".|$|E
500|$|A {{major theme}} of [...] "Box Cutter" [...] {{involves}} Walter's gradual change from an unwitting participant in a drug-dealing enterprise {{into a man}} more comfortable with {{a life of crime}} who embraces his darker side and becomes more proactively violent and dangerous. This development began during the latter episodes of the third season and would continue to be a major theme throughout the fourth season. The episode also introduced the ongoing theme of Jesse's moral decline and self guilt over his killing of Gale. Aaron Paul said of this, [...] "Jesse's much more raw this season. He's very distant, and he's turned to just utter chaos and destruction to keep his mind busy. When he's left alone in his own thoughts, that's when things can get kind of dangerous <b>and</b> <b>scary</b> for Jesse." ...|$|E
500|$|Reactions to the Xbox port {{were also}} positive. Reviewers have written that the PlayStation 2 and Xbox {{versions}} were mostly similar, {{except for the}} Born from a Wish side-scenario found in the Xbox version. Eurogamers Kristan Reed called Born from a Wish [...] "more like a demo than anything", while Fielder described it as [...] "a commendable extra". Both felt {{that it could be}} completed in around an hour and did not add much to the game. The PC port, in contrast, received mixed reaction. Allen Rausch of GameSpy considered the PC port overall to be [...] " [...] fantastic translation of Konami's stylish <b>and</b> <b>scary</b> survival-horror game". IGN's Ivan Sulic advised against playing the game with the keyboard, and rated the game [...] "great". Conversely, Ron Dulin, another reviewer for GameSpot, wrote: [...] "Not even the game's foggy atmosphere is thick enough to hide Silent Hill 2s problems." ...|$|E
