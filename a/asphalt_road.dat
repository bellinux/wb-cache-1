5|$|US 80 {{was removed}} from the state highway system in the 1964 state highway {{renumbering}} when I-80 was designated; I-8 assumed the routing from San Diego to El Centro and Yuma. However, US 80 signs were posted for several years afterward on the remaining portions of the original <b>asphalt</b> <b>road</b> that had not been bypassed by the freeway. The AASHO formally recognized California's requested elimination of US 80 by 1969. Gradually, the route {{was removed from}} Arizona, New Mexico and part of Texas between 1977 and 1991. After the freeway was built, the population of Jacumba went from 400 to 200, and many businesses closed or relocated. However, the population began to increase after a few years, and residents began commuting to jobs in El Centro and San Diego. Following a campaign from the local Old Highway 80 Committee and endorsement from the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, the California State Legislature passed a resolution allowing for the route to be designated and signed as a state historic route, Historic U.S. Route 80, in 2006.|$|E

25|$|Under Pope Shenouda III, {{a number}} of recent renovations were {{performed}} at the monastery. An <b>asphalt</b> <b>road</b> to the monastery was built, and there have been several major cultivation projects. In addition, six water pumps, a sheepfold, a henhouse and two generators were added, together with the construction of new residential cells {{both inside and outside the}} monastery proper. There is now a clinic and a pharmacy to serve the monks, as well as a spacious retreat center for conferences and a large, two story guesthouse that was opened in January 1981.|$|E
25|$|NY157 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY156 (BerneAltamont Road) {{in the town}} of Berne. The route proceeds southeast along Thompson's Lake Road, a two-lane, rural, <b>asphalt</b> <b>road</b> through Berne and climbing down a hill before reaching an intersection with NY157A (Warners Lake Road). After NY157A, the route runs east through Berne, reaching an intersection with Old Stage Road. At this junction, the route turns southward, crossing past more residences and farms and an intersection with the western terminus of County Route256 (CR256, named Ketcham Road). At the junction with Singer Road, NY157 turns southeast once again, crossing past similar surroundings.|$|E
25|$|NY145 through Durham {{remains a}} two-lane <b>asphalt</b> <b>road,</b> passing residences {{on both sides}} of the road, winding {{northwest}} past another quarry. Just north of the quarry, NY145 becomes a two-lane commercial/industrial roadway, passing an intersection with the terminus of CR67A. After CR67A, more residences and industrial buildings begin to appear as the route enters the hamlet of East Durham. In East Durham, NY145 intersects with CR20B, leaving the small hamlet near Golden Hill Road. NY145 winds northwest through Durham, passing a large industrial complex before crossing into the fields and residences nearby. At CR27, NY145 turns westward, slowly bending to the northwest once again.|$|E

25|$|The {{surface of}} the fault is {{creeping}} at less than 0.5cm (0.2in) {{per year in the}} regions of concern. Extreme southern regions of the fault are creeping more quickly, perhaps sufficiently to prevent fault rupture there, but mostly the creep is insufficient to relieve the accumulating forces upon most of the fault and so will not prevent a large earthquake. The creep is sufficient to displace roads, curbs, and sidewalks and so visibly reveal the surface trace in many locations. Creep damage to <b>asphalt</b> <b>road</b> surfaces will usually appear as a series of echelon cracks. Creep effects may be seen also in older structures crossing the fault, some of which have been fitted with expansion joints to accommodate this slow motion.|$|E
500|$|US 80 was {{designated}} on November 11, 1926, {{along with the}} rest of the U.S. Routes. The <b>asphalt</b> <b>road</b> was constructed through the valley as the main east–west route, and was open by 1927. Another road was constructed in the early 1930s, to remove curves and widen the lanes. The result was a two-lane road that still had many switchbacks, with one popularly known as [...] "Dead Man's Curve". Planning for this new alignment was underway in 1932, and much of the work was to be located at the Viejas Grade, and at the segment just west of Alpine. Paving continued on US 80 into 1934, just west of the sand dunes.|$|E
500|$|RM187 {{begins at}} its {{southern}} terminus with US Highway57 (US57), near Batesville, as a paved, two-lane, <b>asphalt</b> <b>road.</b> RM187 winds through several miles of Southern Texas grassland dotted with trees. The highway passes several large ranches and farms along this course and intersects with several county routes and private roads. For {{this stretch of}} the route, RM187 is heading in a northeast direction. The highway turns north about [...] south of an intersection with FM140. The two highways run concurrently for nearly a mile (1.6km) before FM140 turns westward. RM187 continues north through rolling grasslands for almost [...] before turning in a northeast direction. The route continues in this direction for about two miles before returning to a northerly direction. After about , RM187 intersects with US90 and State Highway127 (SH127) {{in the small town}} of Sabinal. The highway continues through more hilly, rolling grasslands. A few miles later, the highway crosses the Sabinal River and proceeds past the Waresville cemetery, the Links of Utopia Golf Course, and the Utopia on the River Airport before passing through the [...] "downtown" [...] area of the village of Utopia.|$|E

2500|$|Two-Lane Blacktop is a 1971 road movie {{directed}} by Monte Hellman, starring singer-songwriter James Taylor, the Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson, Warren Oates, and Laurie Bird. [...] "Blacktop" [...] means an <b>asphalt</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} hydro {{scarification}} (a.k.a. hydroscarification or scarification) uses ultra {{high pressure water}} to remove the top surface of a concrete bridge or road surface. Usually the removal is within 1/4" [...] to 3/4" [...] at the most, but can be of any depth above {{the top layer of}} rebar. Removal of this type is done in order to provide a good microfracture-free surface for bonding with new, sound concrete. Much like applying oil and chips to an <b>asphalt</b> <b>road,</b> this helps extend the useful life of the bridge decking and road surface by delaying the need for complete replacement.|$|E
2500|$|Later on {{he began}} {{receiving}} requests for trucks and buses for transport in Potočari, {{where thousands of}} unarmed Bosnians were captured by the Serb forces {{at the base of}} UN Dutchbat peacekeepers. He received more intel reports regarding the disposition of prisoners to be interrogated as well as predictions on movement of the column. [...] Early on the evening of April 12 he got word from Vukotić that units of the 28th Division were carrying out a penetration and evacuation through this space and that practically the entire area was overwhelmed by people from this column. [...] There was also a second VRS blockade in front of the column between Kravica, Konjević Polje and near an <b>asphalt</b> <b>road</b> in Nova Kasaba. [...] Small groups (about 150 men) from column broke through and were reaching Glogova and Cerska, so Obrenović was tasked to take all necessary measures {{in order to protect the}} elements of combat deployment of the brigade as well as populated Serb villages in the territory of Zvornik.|$|E

2500|$|Asphalt {{overlays}} {{are sometimes}} laid over distressed concrete {{to restore a}} smooth wearing surface. A disadvantage of this method is that movement in the joints between the underlying concrete slabs, whether from thermal expansion and contraction, or from deflection of the concrete slabs from truck axle loads, usually causes [...] reflective cracks in the asphalt. To decrease reflective cracking, concrete pavement is broken apart through a break and seat, crack and seat, or rubblization process. Geosynthetics {{can be used for}} reflective crack control. With break and seat and crack and seat processes, a heavy weight is dropped on the concrete to induce cracking, then a heavy roller is used to seat the resultant pieces into the subbase. The main difference between the two processes is the equipment used to break the concrete pavement {{and the size of the}} resulting pieces. The theory is frequent small cracks will spread thermal stress over a wider area than infrequent large joints, reducing the stress on the overlying asphalt pavement. Rubblization is a more complete fracturing of the old, worn-out concrete, effectively converting the old pavement into an aggregate base for a new <b>asphalt</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The first dash up the <b>asphalt</b> <b>road</b> {{met with}} {{heavy machine gun}} fire which killed two {{soldiers}} and wounded four more. A few moments later, Mordechai Goldman, an Israeli officer and personal deputy to Harnik and seven other men began a second assault. Goldman and two others reached the main trench, encountering a Palestinian and killing him. The two other soldiers tried to jump over the trench but were cut down. Goldman moved farther along the trench, threw a grenade into it and then jumped down and killed the Palestinian fighter. Since his magazine was almost empty by then, {{he picked up the}} dead Palestinian's AK-47. He then climbed out of the trench and ran alongside it. He killed another Palestinian before being joined by Harnik and two other soldiers. [...] Harnik and Goldman then came across a lone Palestinian, entrenched in a concrete position. The Palestinian managed to kill Harnik with a bullet to the chest before Goldman threw an explosive charge at his position, killing the Palestinian fighter and destroying the position. Another soldier was killed by the time the engineering company went into action. Most of the remaining Palestinians were killed as Israeli troops secured the mountain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Starting with a {{discussion}} of development concepts which were applied in practice and which followed the developmentalist paradigm the expansion of traffic infrastructure in colonial and post-colonial periods is presented for the High Asian mountain rim. Selective railways and roads are the major feature of this development, which aimed first on serving the convenience of hill station visitors and followed strategic considerations later on. This bias between regional planning and implementation remains a characteristic feature. At the same time traffic infrastructure without <b>asphalt</b> <b>roads</b> is important for the mountain areas, thus breaking up the strong correlation between development and <b>asphalt</b> <b>roads...</b>|$|R

50|$|The game is {{set upon}} two islands: Ibiza (an {{island in the}} Balearic Islands which belongs to Spain) and Oahu (one of the Hawaiian islands). Both islands have been modeled mostly {{accurately}} by using satellite data. Each island has both <b>asphalt</b> <b>roads</b> and off-road routes, translated to roughly two-thirds of all <b>roads</b> being <b>asphalt</b> <b>roads,</b> and {{the total amount of}} road exceeds 3,000 kilometers, or 1,864 miles. The racing of the game is pretty similar with the standard race types and three cups in the game (one in Ibiza and two on Oahu). The game AI is easier than in the original.|$|R
