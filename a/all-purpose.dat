5|$|The grey jay {{typically}} breeds at {{two years}} of age. Monogamous, pairs remain together for life, though a bird will pair {{up with a new}} partner if it is widowed. Breeding takes place during March and April, depending on latitude, in permanent, <b>all-purpose</b> territories. Second broods are not attempted, perhaps allowing greater time for food storage.|$|E

5|$|The 1921 Grey Cup {{victory was}} their last until 1933, {{at which point}} the Argonauts became the {{dominant}} team of an increasingly nationwide sport.

5|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater breeds in monogamous pairs in a {{breeding}} season that extends from July to March, with migrating birds nesting later than sedentary birds. They nest solitarily in <b>all-purpose</b> territories that both parents defend against conspecifics {{and other species}} including thornbills, spinebills, and silvereyes, although the male is involved in more aggressive interactions than the female. Within {{a breeding}} season females lay two or three clutches of eggs, re-nesting with the same partner in the same territory. Banded birds {{have been identified in}} the same territory for periods of up to five years.|$|E
5|$|After holding Arkansas {{scoreless}} {{on their}} first possession of the third quarter, Alabama's Marquis Maze returned a Dylan Breeding punt 83-yards for a touchdown and a 24–7 Crimson Tide lead.

5|$|Aram Avakian was {{initially}} selected {{to be the}} film's director, but when he continually refused to do a sentimental-type dog story, he was replaced by Leslie H. Martinson. Lillie Hayward and Roberta Hodes wrote the screenplay for the film, adapting several of the short stories from the novel to create a single narrative, and adding in an <b>all-purpose</b> villain. The film was released on June 6, 1962. The studio {{hoped it would be}} successful enough to be followed by a second film and a television series. Though praised by fans and modern reviewers, contemporary critiques felt Terhune's work did not translate well to film and it was considered a low budget, B-movie. It was released to home video in 1995.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{graduation}} from the University of Michigan, Wheatley {{was selected by}} the New York Giants of the NFL {{in the first round}} of the 1995 NFL Draft. As a running back for the Giants, he was the team's <b>all-purpose</b> yards leader in 1996 and their leading ballcarrier in 1997.

During his NFL career (1995–2004), he totaled over 6,500all-purpose yards as a running back and kickoff returner.|$|E
5|$|In early 1966 Jim Brown, who {{had begun}} an acting career two years before, was {{shooting}} {{for his second}} film in London. The Dirty Dozen cast Brown as Robert Jefferson, a convict sent to France during World War II to assassinate German officers meeting at a castle near Rennes in Brittany. Production delays due to bad weather meant he would miss {{at least the first}} part of training camp on the campus of Hiram College, which annoyed Modell, who threatened to fine Brown $1,500 for every week of camp he missed. Brown, who had previously said that 1966 would be his last season, announced his retirement instead. At the end of his nine-year career, Brown held records for most rushing yards in a game, a season and a career. He also owned the record for <b>all-purpose</b> yards in a career and best average per carry for a running back at 5.22yards, a mark that still stands.|$|E

Other facilities include two banks, a library, a Post Greenland office and a small hospital/health center with 19 beds.|$|E
5|$|Sayers {{was drafted}} by the Chicago Bears in the first round, fourth overall, in the 1965 NFL Draft, and was also picked fifth overall by the Kansas City Chiefs of the American Football League in the AFL draft.

In his rookie year, he scored an NFL-record 22 touchdowns: 14 rushing, six receiving, and one each on punt and kickoff returns. He gained 2,272 <b>all-purpose</b> yards, a record for an NFL rookie, with 1,371 of them coming from scrimmage. Sayers averaged 5.2 yards per rush and 17.5 yards per reception.

During his Jayhawks career, he rushed for 2,675 yards and gained a Big Eight Conference-record 4,020 <b>all-purpose</b> yards. He was three times recognized as a first-team All–Big Eight selection and was a consensus pick for the College Football All-America Team in both 1963 and 1964.|$|E
