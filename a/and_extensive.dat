5|$|The infrageneric {{phylogeny}} of Narcissus {{still remains}} relatively unsettled, the taxonomy having proved complex {{and difficult to}} resolve, due to {{the diversity of the}} wild species, the ease with which natural hybridization occurs, <b>and</b> <b>extensive</b> cultivation and breeding accompanied by escape and naturalisation. Consequently, the number of accepted species has varied widely.|$|E

5|$|A local architect, Thomas Fosbrooke, {{carried out}} the first archaeological {{investigation}} of the site in 1900, <b>and</b> <b>extensive</b> restoration work took place the following years. The Rawdon family were given a government grant for further repairs in 1912 {{and they began to}} start charging visitors for entry. The family found themselves unable to afford to maintain the castle, and by the early 1930s the walls had become unstable and dangerous. The castle was placed into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works in 1932, who carried out repairs, replacing some stonework and opening up the surrounding grounds to visitors.|$|E

The tower continued as the Lords' records office through the 18th century, and several sets of renovations and building work were carried out to improve its fire-proofing and comfort, creating the current appearance of the tower. In 1834, the tower was one of only four buildings to survive a terrible fire in Westminster, and in the aftermath the records were moved to a new, purpose-built archive.|$|E

5|$|Before the war, New Albany was {{the largest}} city in the state, mainly because of its river {{contacts}} <b>and</b> <b>extensive</b> trade with the South. Over half of Hoosiers with over $100,000 lived in New Albany. During the war, the trade with the South came to a halt, and many residents considered those of New Albany as too friendly to the South. The city never regained its stature. It was stilled as a city of 40,000 with its early-Victorian Mansion-Row buildings remaining from the boom period.|$|E
5|$|By this time, however, St Briavels Castle {{had been}} in a slow period of decline for many years, similar to that of several other royal castles in the region, {{including}} Bristol and Gloucester.

Although the reproductive habits of V. togata have not been extensively studied, the species is believed {{to be one of the}} most fecund among octopuses in its region and depth level, despite the species possessing large eggs and extremely large spermatophores.|$|E

Other work included the Patronus charm that interrupts the wedding party to inform the guests that Voldemort has taken over the Ministry of Magic.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, the {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta and the First Barons' War shifted. Henry VII took power {{at the end of}} the turbulent Wars of the Roses, followed by Henry VIII, <b>and</b> <b>extensive</b> propaganda under both rulers promoted the legitimacy of the regime, the illegitimacy of any sort of rebellion against royal power, and the priority of supporting the Crown in its arguments with the Papacy.|$|E
