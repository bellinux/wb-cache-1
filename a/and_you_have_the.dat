500|$|The song has {{received}} mixed to positive ratings from music critics. Music journalist Bill Lamb from About.com praised the song for [...] "spreading smiles and pure fun {{around the world}} in record time." [...] He then writes, [...] "take one part LMFAO's synth-based party music, another part Ricky Martin's Latin dance party and the rest a powerfully charismatic South Korean showman <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> first worldwide K-Pop smash hit." [...] Billboard K-Town columnist Jeff Benjamin {{became one of the first}} music critics to review the song when he published an article and reported that [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] has gone viral on the Internet. In his article, Benjamin introduced the reader to a couple of popular K-pop songs and wrote that [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] in particular, plays all the right moves sonically while [...] "borrowing from LMFAO along the way".|$|E
500|$|Daniel Pemberton {{composed}} {{the music for}} the film. Much like the film's visual approach, the score {{is divided into three}} distinguishable sections, each corresponding to the intended feel of the act in which the section is heard. [...] "You have the first act which is analog," [...] Pemberton explains, [...] "you have the second act which is orchestral, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> third act which is digital." [...] For the first act's composition, Pemberton primarily used analog synthesizers, in particular ones released no later than 1984 – the time the first act takes place – such as the Roland SH-1000 and Yamaha CS-80. The second act's score is more operatic in nature, matching the setting of the San Francisco Opera House. Finally, the third act featured a more introspective score produced entirely digitally to complement its backdrop of the 1998 iMac product launch, and Pemberton correspondingly used his own iMac to compose this section.|$|E
500|$|Many of The Search for Spocks {{dialogue}} sequences feature tight close-up shots. During Kirk and Sarek's mind meld, Nimoy chose {{cuts that}} focused on accentuating the dialogue; [...] "Instead of watching people's faces, all you see is the mouth or the eyes <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> tendency to hear better," [...] Correll explained. Correll was unhappy that every scene save one was filmed on a soundstage. Feeling that recreating everything on set resulted in a fake look, the cinematographer suggested that Genesis be filmed on Kauai in Hawaii, and that Red Rock Canyon stand in for Vulcan. The production {{did not have the}} money to shoot on location, meaning that Nimoy was preoccupied with making sure the various outdoor settings felt believable. While the various vessel exteriors were handled by ILM, Correll was responsible for the look of the interior sets. He preferred to treat these as actual locations inside the ships; although the sets' ceilings were designed to be removed so that lights could be rigged in the rafters, Correll used other lighting methods. In the Bird of Prey, he used fluorescent tubes to pick up the walls' metallic paints, and kept the set smoky to convey a dirty atmosphere.|$|E

500|$|A major effect {{required}} {{throughout the}} episode was face replacements, {{especially during the}} 'May vs. May' fight where it had to appear as if Wen was fighting herself. All the effects were completed in the two weeks between the filming and airing of the episode. Wen noted that [...] "Kevin Tancharoen directed [...] and he’s amazing with his directing with the Mortal Kombat series. So we had this really complicated sequence where we do this 360 and it reveals me and it reveals me again and there’s no cut and you wonder how that happens {{in one of the}} fight sequences. And that’s because they completely scanned and CGIed my face onto the stunt double. So there’s a tremendous amount of work that went into the fight scenes and we did not {{have a lot of time}} to do it." [...] She also elaborated that [...] "On the day of, you have the set <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> cameras, and you have to deal with special effects, because on top of everything else we had to scan my face and go through this incredible process of taking a million pictures so they were able to meld it onto Sam’s face." ...|$|E

[...] Always tough on his players, Smith drilled them until a technique was perfected regardless {{of the time that}} it took. Despite this, his players were known to idolize Smith, for they felt his respect towards them and his commitment to the team.|$|E
