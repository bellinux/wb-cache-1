40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} {{that there are many}} differences between <b>animal</b> <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> microRNAs (miRNAs), <b>and</b> that numerical features based on sequence and structure can be used to predict the function of individual miRNAs. However, there is little research regarding numerical differences between <b>animal</b> <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> miRNAs, <b>and</b> whether a single numerical feature or combination of features could be used to distinguish <b>animal</b> <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> miRNAs or not. Therefore, in current study we aimed to discover numerical features {{that could be used to}} accomplish this. We performed a large-scale analysis of 132 miRNA numerical features, and identified 17 highly significant distinguishing features. However, none of the features independently could clearly differentiate <b>animal</b> <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> miRNAs. By further analysis, we found a four-feature subset that included helix number, stack number, length of pre-miRNA, and minimum free energy, and developed a logistic classifier that could distinguish <b>animal</b> <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> miRNAs effectively. The precision of the classifier was greater than 80 %. Using this tool, we confirmed that there were universal differences between <b>animal</b> <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> miRNAs, <b>and</b> that a single feature was unable to adequately distinguish the difference. This feature set and classifier represent a valuable tool for identifying differences between <b>animal</b> <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> miRNAs at a molecular level...|$|R

5|$|The fossils {{found in}} {{abundance}} along this coastline {{provide evidence of}} how <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> evolved in this region. During the Triassic this area was a desert, while in the Jurassic {{it was part of}} a tropical sea, and in the Cretaceous it was covered by swamps. The fossilised remains of the <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> that lived in those periods are very well preserved, providing a wealth of information on their body shapes, the way they died and even the fossilised remains of their last meals. Fossil groups found here include crustaceans, insects, molluscs, echinoderms, fish, amphibians, reptiles and a few mammals. At Lulworth Cove there is a fossil forest of conifers, tree-ferns and cycads.|$|E

5|$|Castle Lake and the {{surrounding}} area contain a wide variety of <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> including trout, bears, deer, otters, frogs, and osprey.

5|$|Gibraltar's {{appearance}} in prehistory was very different. Whereas {{today it is}} surrounded by sea, the water level was much lower in prehistoric times, when the polar ice caps were larger.

5|$|The many {{sedimentary}} layers on this coastline {{are rich}} with fossils, {{the remains of}} the <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> present in the area whose tissues became immersed in deposits of mud which later hardened into rock. At Lyme Regis, for example, geologists have identified 71 layers of rock, each one containing fossils of a different species of ammonite.|$|E

5|$|Anthropogenic ecology {{refers to}} the human impact on <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> in an ecosystem. A shift from medium and large game animals, such as deer, bighorn sheep, and antelope, to smaller ones like rabbits and turkey during the mid-10th to mid-13th centuries might {{indicate}} that Mesa Verdean subsistence hunting had dramatically altered faunal populations on the mesa. Analysis of pack rat midden indicates that, {{with the exception of}} invasive species such as tumbleweed and clover, the flora and fauna in the area have remained relatively consistent for the past 4,000 years.|$|E
5|$|Breeding of <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> showed related {{varieties}} varying {{in similar}} ways, or tending {{to revert to}} an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent.

5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
5|$|In <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants,</b> a {{tricyclic}} compound called molybdopterin (which, {{despite the}} name, contains no molybdenum) is reacted with molybdate {{to form a}} complete molybdenum-containing cofactor called molybdenum cofactor. Other than the phylogenetically-ancient nitrogenases (discussed above) that fix nitrogen in some bacteria and cyanobacteria, all molybdenum-using enzymes (so far identified) use the molybdenum cofactor, where molybdenum is in the oxidation state of VI, similar to molybdate. Molybdenum enzymes in plants and animals catalyze the oxidation and sometimes reduction of certain small molecules {{in the process of}} regulating nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|Pattern {{recognition}} receptors are proteins used {{by nearly}} all organisms to identify molecules associated with pathogens. Antimicrobial peptides called defensins are an evolutionarily conserved {{component of the}} innate immune response found in all <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants,</b> and represent the main form of invertebrate systemic immunity. The complement system and phagocytic cells are also used by most forms of invertebrate life. Ribonucleases and the RNA interference pathway are conserved across all eukaryotes, and are thought {{to play a role}} in the immune response to viruses.|$|E

5|$|Supervised by his father, Georg Forster first {{undertook}} {{studies of}} the zoology and botanics of the southern seas, mostly by drawing <b>animals</b> <b>and</b> <b>plants.</b> However, Georg also pursued his own interests, which led to completely independent explorations in comparative geography and ethnology. He quickly learned the languages of the Polynesian islands. His reports {{on the people of}} Polynesia are well regarded today, as they describe the inhabitants of the southern islands with empathy, sympathy and largely without Western or Christian bias.|$|E
