5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, {{around the}} time of U2's second, spiritually charged album, October, a rift was created in the band between Clayton and McGuinness, and the three other band members. Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group, and were {{questioning}} the compatibility of rock music with their spirituality. However, Clayton, with his more ambiguous religious views, was less concerned, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> more of an outsider.|$|E
5|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision, the three judges {{decided that the}} appeal should be allowed (more specifically, that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal heard and allowed instanter– at once), {{on the basis that}} the 8March 2003 interview was not voluntary <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> inadmissible, and by admitting it the trial judge had made an error of law resulting in a miscarriage of justice.|$|E

5|$|Aged six, Castro, {{along with}} his elder {{siblings}} Ramón and Angela, was sent {{to live with their}} teacher in Santiago de Cuba, dwelling in cramped conditions and relative poverty, often failing to have enough to eat because of their tutor's poor economic situation. Aged eight, Castro was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church, although later became an atheist. Being baptized enabled Castro to attend the La Salle boarding school in Santiago, where he regularly misbehaved, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> sent to the privately funded, Jesuit-run Dolores School in Santiago. In 1945 he transferred to the more prestigious Jesuit-run El Colegio de Belén in Havana. Although Castro took an interest in history, geography and debating at Belén, he did not excel academically, instead devoting much of his time to playing sport.|$|E
5|$|Although Aucouturier had {{abandoned}} in the first stage, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> not eligible for the general classification, he could still start {{the rest of the}} stages. In the second stage, Aucouturier was able to win the sprint. In the third stage, the cyclists who were competing for the general classification started one hour earlier than the other cyclists, including Aucouturier. At the end of that stage, a group of four cyclists had broken away, and Eugène Brange won the sprint. Aucouturier finished 27 minutes later, but this meant that he had run the course 33 minutes faster, so he was declared the winner of the stage. Garin retained the lead, helped by a crash of second-placed Pagie in the second stage, which eliminated him from the race.|$|E
5|$|Although the Americans {{had taken}} the vessel, Sterett had no orders to take prizes <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> obliged to release her. Enterprise {{completed}} her journey to Malta, and received honor and praise from the squadron's Commodore on her return to the fleet. The success of the battle boosted morale in the United States, since it was that country's first victory {{in the war against}} the Tripolitans. The opposite occurred in Tripoli, where morale sank heavily upon learning of Tripoli defeat. Despite Enterprise triumph, the war continued indecisively for another four years.|$|E

5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour arose from the German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar and his entourage of chiefs should dismount and lead {{the main body of}} German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in the centre of the action, he would {{have no way of knowing}} what was happening in other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was likely in the gap between the two Roman lines.|$|E
5|$|As the 15th Lok Sabha {{was due to}} {{complete}} its constitutional term on 31 May 2014, a general election was called by the Election Commission for {{the constitution of the}} 16th Lok Sabha. The election was held in nine phases from 7 April to 12 May 2014. The Congress party had won the previous two elections in 2004 and 2009, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> campaigning to win the election for the third consecutive time. The result of this election were declared on 16 May, before the 15th Lok Sabha completed its constitutional mandate on 31 May 2014.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} it was thought that Alpha was the twenty-second storm of the season, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> the storm which broke the 1933 season's record for most storms in a single season. However post-season {{analysis}} revealed that there was also a previously unnoticed subtropical storm on October4, which made Alpha the twenty-third storm of the season. Alpha was the first tropical storm to be assigned a Greek-alphabet name after the list of hurricane names was exhausted.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, Morgan was {{promoted}} to brigadier and assumed command of the 1st Support Group of the 1st Armoured Division. When the 1st Support Group was shipped to France in May 1940, following {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, it had already been stripped of its two field artillery regiments and two infantry battalions. As a result, Morgan's command included only a force of Royal Engineers and a Territorial Army (TA) battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, which {{was in the process of}} converting to an anti-aircraft/anti-tank regiment and armed only with anti-tank guns. His group was in no position to fulfil its normal role supporting the division's armoured brigades <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> sent to reinforce the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division south of the river Somme. During a confused retreat most of the Support Group was captured along with the 51st Division at Saint-Valery-en-Caux but the remainder, including Morgan, got away and were evacuated to England.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, Galland {{tracked down}} his mechanic, Gerhard Meyer, who had {{installed}} the armour that {{saved his life}} in 1941. On 25 June 1983, he entertained them {{at his home in}} Oberwinter, Remagen on the river Rhine. They were invited every year until Galland's death. In early February 1996, Galland was taken seriously ill. He had wanted to die at home <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> released from hospital and returned to his own house. With his wife Heidi, son and daughter present, he was given the last rites. Adolf Galland died at 01:15 in the morning of Tuesday, 9 February 1996. Galland was buried at St Laurentius Church, Oberwinter on 21 February. A memorial service was held on 31 March.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City's first tie {{was against}} Luton Town of the Third Division, which City won 1–0, Francis Lee the scorer. In the fourth round, the club were drawn away to Newcastle United, {{one of only}} two top-flight clubs with an away draw. The match {{finished}} 0–0, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> replayed at Maine Road. Manchester City won 2–0, but had to play much of the match with 10 men after Mike Summerbee was sent off. Like Leicester's fifth round tie, Manchester City's match at Blackburn Rovers' Ewood Park was delayed multiple times due to poor weather. When it was eventually played Manchester City were comfortable 4–1 winners. In the sixth round, Manchester City were drawn at home to Tottenham Hotspur. The match was closely contested; in his autobiography, City's Mike Doyle described it as the hardest match of the whole cup run. As in the third round, City won 1–0 thanks to a Francis Lee goal.|$|E
50|$|A minor {{annoyance}} {{with the}} camera is that the cover caps for the remote-control socket and PC Sync sockets are not tethered to the body, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> very easy to lose or misplace in use. Fortunately, these caps are common to many Nikon models (F100, D2, etc.) <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> readily <b>and</b> cheaply available.|$|R

50|$|The {{delta wing}} is a {{triangle}} shape {{which may be}} used for a number of reasons.

As a supersonic wing it combines high strength with low drag <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> often used for fast jets.|$|R
