5|$|A Titan's {{durability}} {{depends on}} its size; larger Titans will take more effort to defeat than others and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> immune to Crash's attacks. To defeat them, Crash has to jack a smaller Titan to fight them. On defeating the larger Titan, he can dismount the Titan he previously jacked and directly jack the larger Titan. The dismounted Titan will then be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Although most ants survive {{attempts}} by humans to eradicate them, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> highly endangered. These {{tend to be}} island species that have evolved specialized traits and risk being displaced by introduced ant species. Examples include the critically endangered Sri Lankan relict ant (Aneuretus simoni) and Adetomyrma venatrix of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Although most flies {{live and}} fly {{close to the}} ground, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> known to fly at heights and a few like Oscinella (Chloropidae) {{are known to be}} {{dispersed}} by winds at altitudes of up to 2000ft and over long distances. Some hover flies like Metasyrphus corollae have been known to undertake long flights in response to aphid population spurts.|$|E

50|$|The {{company had}} not {{given up on the}} rear-engined idea and a new car, the Type J, {{appeared}} in 1922 but only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> sold. It had a bonnet and radiator very similar to the front-engined cars. The final car, the type G of 1930 was also rear-engined, with the engine behind the rear axle, only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> made.|$|R
5|$|Enzymes {{are known}} to {{catalyze}} more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types. Most enzymes are proteins, although <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> catalytic RNA molecules. The latter are called ribozymes. Enzymes' specificity comes from their unique three-dimensional structures.|$|E
5|$|Most {{national}} cemeteries {{are administered}} by the Department of Veterans Affairs, although <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> managed by the National Park Service and the U.S. Army. None of the cemeteries are considered official units of the system; they are all affiliated with other parks.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{are found}} in both deep oceans and shallow coastal waters worldwide. The {{greatest}} diversity is in the tropics {{although there are many}} species adapted to relatively cold waters. The majority of species cling on to rocks, shells or submerged timber, often hiding in cracks or under seaweed, but some burrow into sand and mud, and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> pelagic.|$|E

5|$|Several equine therapy centers use the Mérens {{in their}} program. Other {{uses for the}} breed include various {{agricultural}} work, including logging, where sure-footed mountain horses {{can be used to}} access areas where equipment cannot go. Mounted police sometimes use the Mérens. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> bred for their milk, which can be used in the manufacture of various products.|$|E
5|$|The Ediacara-type {{assemblage}} {{is named}} after Australia's Ediacara Hills, and consists of fossils preserved in facies of coastal lagoons and rivers. They are typically found in red gypsiferous and calcareous paleosols formed on loess and flood deposits in an arid cool temperate paleoclimate. Most fossils are preserved as imprints in microbial earths, but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> preserved within sandy units.|$|E
5|$|The Phalacrocoracidae are {{a family}} of medium to large coastal, {{fish-eating}} seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage colouration varies; the majority of species have mainly dark plumage, but some are pied black and white, and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> more colourful.|$|E
25|$|Between 1900 and 1935, {{dozens of}} natural color systems were introduced, {{although}} only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> successful.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> {{delivered}} to Czechoslovakia {{in the early}} 1950s which used them under the designation NK-14.|$|R
50|$|Some disappearing guns {{also used}} {{compressed}} air, while <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> built {{to be raised}} by steam.|$|R
5|$|The frescoes {{inside the}} church are {{commonly}} dated to the 14th–15th century, though they follow a standard compositional model which had been established in Bulgarian church decoration since the 13th century. Unusually, most of the captions which accompany the images are in Byzantine Greek, though <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> in Old Church Slavonic. In terms of style, the murals {{have much in common}} with churches from the southwestern Bulgarian lands.|$|E
5|$|The stomach in the {{cephalothorax}} {{acts as a}} pump {{that sends}} the food deeper into the digestive system. The mid gut bears many digestive ceca, compartments with no other exit, that extract nutrients from the food; most are in the abdomen, which {{is dominated by the}} digestive system, but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> found in the cephalothorax.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, {{and only a}} few large islands, such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species. Ants occupy a wide range of {{ecological}} niches and exploit many different food resources as direct or indirect herbivores, predators and scavengers. Most ant species are omnivorous generalists, but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> specialist feeders. Their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15–20% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of terrestrial animal biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} names showed Greek influences, while <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> clearly {{the names of}} Christian female saints.|$|R
50|$|OFM Ro.30: (1932) three-seat {{reconnaissance}} biplane, 1x530hp Alfa Romeo Mercurius or 1xPiaggio 126-RC35 Jupiter. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> built.|$|R
50|$|Hundreds of {{different}} text smileys were developed over time, but only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> generally accepted, used and understood.|$|R
5|$|Butterflies {{are often}} polymorphic, and many species {{make use of}} camouflage, mimicry and aposematism to evade their predators. Some, like the monarch and the painted lady, migrate over long distances. Many {{butterflies}} are attacked by parasites or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and other invertebrates, or are preyed upon by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants. Larvae of a few butterflies (e.g., harvesters) eat harmful insects, and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> predators of ants, while others live as mutualists in association with ants. Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, the Lascaris War Rooms {{were built}} in Valletta {{to serve as the}} war {{headquarters}} for the defence of Malta. They were later used in the headquarters of the Allied invasion of Sicily. Throughout the war, many air-raid shelters also were dug in the limestone rock of the islands, either by the government or by individuals or families, to protect the civilian population of Malta from Italian or German aerial bombardment. Many of the shelters still exist, and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the mechanical ore crusher in 1804 the tasks traditionally carried out by bal maidens began to be mechanised. Despite this, the rapid growth of the mines in comparison to the slow spread of mechanisation meant the number of bal maidens appears to have risen steadily, although statistics for the number of women employed in the mines {{in the early days of}} industrialisation are incomplete and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> contradictory.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of those}} {{deported}} were Norwegian citizens. Some were stateless refugees, and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> citizens of other countries.|$|R

50|$|Only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> deaths <b>were</b> {{recorded}} {{due to the}} earthquake, reportedly {{because a}} strong foreshock had caused people to leave their homes. The same is also true for the following tsunami with the inhabitants running to higher ground after seeing the water recede, so that only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> killed.|$|R
5|$|From 1714 onwards, about 52 {{batteries}} and redoubts were {{built around the}} coasts of Malta and Gozo. A few of the batteries were built around existing coastal watchtowers, such as Qawra and Aħrax Towers. Most of the batteries were destroyed over the years or are in ruins, but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> still more or less intact, including Mistra, Vendôme, Ferretti, St. Anthony's, Qolla l-Bajda and St. Mary's Batteries. Very few redoubts survive, including Briconet, Ximenes and St. George Redoubts. Various entrenchments were also built between the 1720s and 1760s, both around the coastline and along some inland positions. The remains of a few still survive today, including the Naxxar Entrenchment and the Louvier Entrenchment.|$|E
5|$|In chemistry, a nonmetal (or non-metal) is a {{chemical}} element that mostly lacks metallic attributes. Physically, nonmetals {{tend to be}} highly volatile (easily vaporized), have low elasticity, and are good insulators of heat and electricity; chemically, {{they tend to have}} high ionization energy and electronegativity values, and gain or share electrons when they react with other elements or compounds. Seventeen elements are generally classified as nonmetals; most are gases (hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, chlorine, argon, krypton, xenon and radon); one is a liquid (bromine), and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> solids (carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, selenium, and iodine).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{recreational}} riding experienced a revival, and {{the consumption of}} horse meat continued to decrease. On March 11, 1994, the Trait du Nord was officially declared to be a workhorse again, and in 1996 another decree prohibited docking of tails in horses. Members of the breed are occasionally exported from France, with some going to Italy, Belgium and Germany, mainly for work in logging and pulling brewery wagons. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>are</b> sent to Sicily and Guadeloupe, but this is quite rare.|$|E
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Hurricane Katrina, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> sold to Gulf Coast residents who preferred them to government-supplied temporary housing.|$|R
50|$|Most of the Progressive {{candidates}} were in New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Massachusetts. Only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> in the South.|$|R
50|$|The Breda Ba.79S was a {{single-engine}} four-seat high-wing {{private aircraft}} built in Italy {{in the late}} 1930s. Only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>were</b> produced.|$|R
