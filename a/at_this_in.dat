The direct antiglobulin test (DAT, or direct Coombs' test) is negative, as the hemolysis of PNH is not caused by antibodies. If the PNH occurs in the setting of known (or suspected) aplastic anemia, abnormal white blood cell counts and decreased platelet counts may be seen <b>at</b> <b>this.</b> <b>In</b> this case, anemia may be caused by insufficient red blood cell production in addition to the hemolysis.|$|E

The musicologist Julian Mincham {{notes that the}} fugue deviates from the [...] "traditional alternating of tonic and dominant entries... as a rather abstruse indication {{of the lack of}} clarity and expectation amongst the disciples, Bach is hinting <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> musical terms by having each voice enter on a different note, B-flat, F, C and G and briefly touching upon various related keys. The music is, as always, lucid and focussed but the departure from traditional fugal procedure sends a fleeting message to those who appreciate the subtleties of the musical processes".|$|E

2500|$|Twentieth century {{criticism}} {{moved away}} from trying to prove or disprove that Shakespeare wrote the play, and has instead come {{to focus on the}} issue of co-authorship. Ravenscroft had hinted <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> 1678, but the first modern scholar to look at the theory was John Mackinnon Robertson in 1905, who concluded that [...] "much of the play is written by George Peele, and it is hardly less certain that much of the rest was written by Robert Greene or Kyd, with some by Marlow." [...] In 1919, T.M. Parrott reached the conclusion that Peele wrote Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1, and in 1931, Philip Timberlake corroborated Parrott's findings.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{an ancient}} record of one person who survived a crucifixion that was {{intended}} to be lethal, but that was interrupted. Josephus recounts: [...] "I saw many captives crucified, and remembered three of them as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> my mind, and went with tears in my eyes to Titus, and told him of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of them died under the physician's hands, while the third recovered." [...] Josephus gives no details of the method or duration of the crucifixion of his three friends before their reprieve.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{have argued that}} the opera's relatively low popularity is due to satire that relies on Victorian era class distinctions; it may not be clear to the modern audience why a baronet cannot marry a pew-opener, while in the Victorian era it was self-evident. [...] Also, the humour in the piece relies in many instances on parodies of operatic conventions that may be unfamiliar to some audiences. [...] In 1913, E. J. Dent wrote in reference to The Sorcerer: [...] "It seems as if a course of Mozart in English might be the best preliminary step towards educating our on-coming public to a really intelligent appreciation of Sullivan". Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther argues that while both The Sorcerer and H.M.S. Pinafore satirise the idea of love levelling all ranks, the earlier opera attacks it more aggressively, offending audiences with which that idea was popular. Gilbert acknowledged that his position as a dramatist was similar to one of [...] "a refreshment contractor who has engaged to supply a meal of one dish at which all classes of the community are to sit down", since he needed to suit needs of both [...] "butcher-boy in the gallery" [...] and [...] "epicure in the stalls"; Crowther argues that he did not succeed as well <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> The Sorcerer as in some of the later works.|$|E

60|$|It was not, he continued, a {{thing to}} shed the tear of unavailing regret for, {{though it was not}} a {{transitory}} phase, or a state of transition, for the condition that now existed had always existed. The new reading public was larger than ever before not merely because there was a fresh demand for reading, but because more people were lettered and moneyed and leisured, and did not know what otherwise to do with themselves. It was quite simple, and the fact was less to be regretted in itself than for an indirect result which might be feared from it. He paused <b>at</b> <b>this,</b> <b>in</b> order to be asked what this result was, and being promptly asked he went on.|$|E

Catharine's heart throbbed, for she had heard that the Duchess had the pride {{as well as the}} high courage of the house of Douglas, and felt uncertain touching the reception she was to experience. On entering the castle, she observed that the train was smaller than she had expected, but, as the Duchess lived in close retirement, she was little surprised <b>at</b> <b>this.</b> <b>In</b> a species of anteroom she was met by a little old woman, who seemed bent double with age, and supported herself upon an ebony staff.|$|E
