Batista refused to wrestle, citing his injuries, and as a result Hart awarded the match to his opponent Orton by forfeit. Following Hart's decision, Batista quit WWE.

5|$|Coveleski's {{status as}} the ace of the staff was {{demonstrated}} when he was named the starter for Opening Day of the 1917 season; he beat the Detroit Tigers 6–4 on April 11. He improved statistically during the 1917 season, winning 19 games and losing 14 with an ERA of 1.81 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> high 133 strikeouts. On September 19, Coveleski pitched a one-hitter against the New York Yankees; the only hit came from Fritz Maisel in the seventh inning. Coveleski continued to improve during the war-shortened 1918 season. His outings that year included pitching a complete game against the New York Yankees, where he pitched 19 innings, allowing two runs as the Indians won, 3–2. He finished {{the season with a}} 22–13 record, a 1.82 ERA, and 311innings pitched in 38 games, 33 of them starts; his wins and ERA were both second in the American League to Walter Johnson. In 1919, Coveleski pitched in 43 games, starting 34, and had a 24–12 record and an ERA of 2.61.|$|E

Federer has also achieved a Career Grand Slam, but is missing the Olympic Gold in singles, the Monte-Carlo Masters and Italian Open. Djokovic, as the only man to have won eight of the nine Masters events, is a Cincinnati title away from achieving what has been labelled the Career Golden Masters, as well as needing the Olympic Gold to complete his overall tally.

5|$|In 1816, {{the couple}} famously spent a summer with Lord Byron, John William Polidori, and Claire Clairmont near Geneva, Switzerland, where Mary {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} her novel Frankenstein. The Shelleys left Britain in 1818 for Italy, where their second and third children died before Mary Shelley {{gave birth to her}} last and only surviving child, Percy Florence Shelley. In 1822, her husband drowned when his sailing boat sank during a storm near Viareggio. A year later, Mary Shelley returned to England and from then on devoted herself to the upbringing of her son <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> as a professional author.

5|$|In a {{study done}} by Rosamund Weatherall, Heather Joshi and Susan Macran of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994, the {{research}} presented suggests that women presented with the double burden have a lower mortality rate than women who are simply housewives. The women who were observed that had part-time jobs had a mortality rate lower than the women with full-time jobs and children. The same study also suggests that women who have young children {{are less likely to}} die than women who have no children or have older children. Although this evidence can not be strictly attributed to the double burden of having children <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> field, it can give a good indication of a trend in society. Also, this study was conducted in multiple countries including England, Wales, and the United States which gives the information presented from the study a more global perspective on the double burden.|$|E
5|$|In early 1966 Jim Brown, who {{had begun}} an acting career two years before, was {{shooting}} {{for his second}} film in London. The Dirty Dozen cast Brown as Robert Jefferson, a convict sent to France during World War II to assassinate German officers meeting at a castle near Rennes in Brittany. Production delays due to bad weather meant he would miss {{at least the first}} part of training camp on the campus of Hiram College, which annoyed Modell, who threatened to fine Brown $1,500 for every week of camp he missed. Brown, who had previously said that 1966 would be his last season, announced his retirement instead. At the end of his nine-year career, Brown held records for most rushing yards in a game, a season <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>career.</b> He also owned the record for all-purpose yards in a career and best average per carry for a running back at 5.22yards, a mark that still stands.|$|E
5|$|Nathan {{started the}} season with 13 {{consecutive}} saves but blew his first save of the season on May 27 by giving up a three-run inside-the-park home run on a misplayed fly ball by teammate Delmon Young; however, Nathan got two outs to end the 9th inning and the Twins {{went on to win}} the game. By converting 27 of 29 save opportunities prior to the All-Star break, Nathan was selected as a reserve player for the American League in the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Nathan finished the year with 39 saves <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> best 1.33 ERA. He also had a career high six blown saves and surrendered his first career walk-off home run to Victor Martinez on September 16. Nathan ranked seventh in the majors in saves and had the lowest ERA of the top 30 save leaders in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Rixey went 22–10 in 1916 with a 1.85ERA <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> high of 134strikeouts. On June 29, Rixey {{pitched a}} four-hit shutout against the New York Giants, facing the minimum 27batters, because of three double plays, and a player caught stealing. In 1917, despite having a 2.27 earned run average, Rixey {{led the league}} in {{pitching}} losses with 21. He also handled 108chances without a single error. Rixey hated losing and was known for destroying the team locker room, or disappearing {{for days at a time}} after a loss. He missed the 1918 season to serve in the Chemical Warfare Division of the United States army during the war effort. He struggled upon returning to baseball, going 6–12 with a 3.97earned run average in 1919, and again leading the league in losses with 22 in 1920. Prior to the 1920 season, rumours circulated that his former manager, Pat Moran, now with the Cincinnati Reds, was interested in trading for Rixey. The relationship between Rixey and manager Gavvy Cravath was never good, and Cravath had made known his desire to trade him; however, he stayed with the Phillies that season, working on his delivery with former pitcher Jesse Tannehill, who, Rixey admitted, helped with his pitching delivery.|$|E
5|$|Grove {{started the}} 1944 season with an {{interesting}} honor: {{he was assigned}} to the 4-F All-Star team, a group of 25 major league players who were the best of those exempt from military service. Grove was given the job of being the Opening Day starting pitcher for the White Sox. He pitched {{the first game of the}} season against the Cleveland Indians and their starting pitcher, Al Smith, on April 19, 1944, and won 3–1. Grove also managed to shut out the Yankees on May 18; it was the first time the Yankees had not scored a run in 1944. By mid-season, Grove had seven wins, six losses, five complete games, and a 3.40 ERA. Because of these statistics, he was selected to the American League All-Star team, his first and only career appearance. Five American League pitchers pitched in the All-Star Game on July 11, although Grove was one of the four on the roster who did not; therefore, his lone All-Star appearance was indeed only an appearance. During the second half of the season, Grove performed well at Comiskey Park, but struggled on the road, at one point losing five straight games despite good run support from the White Sox. Grove finished the season with 14 wins, 15 losses, an ERA of 3.72, two shutouts, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> best of nearly 235 innings pitched.|$|E
