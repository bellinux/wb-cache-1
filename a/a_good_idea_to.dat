5|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to create a}} breed registry in 1903 and 1904 failed. In 1912, another attempt was made, this time successful, and a stud book was created in Dijon in 1913. With {{the creation of the}} stud book, only purebred Auxois or Ardennais and Trait du Nord crosses could be registered. However, by 1917, the physical characteristics of the breed were still not fixed, and leaders of the equine community were critical, and doubtful of whether the Auxois was a breed in its own right or still merely a subtype of the Ardennais. They were also unsure whether it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> accept the recognition of another regional breed, of which France had many.|$|E
5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to protect the public from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape, {{it would not have been}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E
5|$|Though Caravan had yet {{to achieve}} strong {{commercial}} success in 1970, they had started to build a live following, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands {{to an audience of}} 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In between touring, the group had written several new pieces that they wanted to record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, If I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You, the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock. Hitchcock had become a fan of the band and had been a key figure in getting them signed to Decca Records. He had progressed from the label's art department to production and was keen to work on the album. The group had been apprehensive about Hitchcock working on If I Could Do It All Over Again... but after discovering his enthusiasm and creative ideas, decided it would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> enrol him as producer.|$|E

5|$|Anthony first appears when he poses as {{a member}} of the Walford council to help Eddie eject a {{squatter}} from a premises that they want to move their antiques business into. He then decides to remain in Walford and helps his father set up the business. Anthony buys some candlesticks from Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), though she does not know their true value, but when Cora finds out their true value, she accuses Anthony of scamming her. Eddie sells the candlesticks for £8000, and when Tyler decides to take part in an unlicensed boxing match, Michael convinces Anthony that Tyler will win and that it would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> place a bet on him, knowing that Anthony suffers with a gambling addiction. Anthony steals £8000 from Eddie's safe, but bets on Tyler's opponent Artie Stiller (Maurice Lee), which leaves Michael unimpressed, as he has researched Artie and found out he is tough. During the fight, however, Tyler narrowly wins so Anthony has to confess to Eddie that he has lost the money. Shortly after he does, Tyler collapses and has a seizure, so is rushed to hospital. Eddie is sickened by Anthony's actions and tells him he wishes he was dying in a hospital bed, rather than Tyler. Distraught, Anthony storms out and attends a party run by Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton), culminating in him kissing her. Afterwards, Anthony returns to the hospital to learn that Tyler has been taken for a life-saving operation and is furious that Eddie was not around. Eddie then admits that his children would be better off without him. Tyler survives and recovers, but the brothers are told by Eddie that Michael set up an unfair fight to punish the family, leading Tyler and Anthony to reject Michael. Eddie then leaves Walford, leaving Tyler and Anthony the antiques business.|$|E
5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that it is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E

25|$|While harvesting, it's also <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> try to {{pick out}} as many eggs/cocoons as {{possible}} and return them to the bin. Eggs are small, lemon-shaped yellowish objects that can usually be seen pretty easily {{with the naked eye}} and picked out.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} more {{extensions}} to Petri nets, however, {{it is important to}} keep in mind, that as the complexity of the net increases in terms of extended properties, the harder it is to use standard tools to evaluate certain properties of the net. For this reason, it is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> use the most simple net type possible for a given modelling task.|$|E
25|$|For Medical Tales Retold, Seluk draws comics about unusual or {{touching}} {{stories he}} gets through his email. These stories are about illnesses and injuries {{and can be}} sent in by doctors or patients. The concept of Medical Tales Retold came up in collaboration with Tapastic. After Seluk saw an artist illustrate personal love stories through Tapastic, {{he thought it would}} be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> normalize unusual medical stories through humor.|$|E

25|$|Openings {{are also}} {{classified}} as Static Rook openings, where the offense {{is supported by}} the rook in its original position, and Ranging Rook openings, where the rook moves to the center or left of the board to support an attack there, typically with the idea of allowing the opponent to attack while arranging a better defense and aiming for a counterattack. However, as the most powerful piece on the board, the rook invites attack, and in most cases, especially for weaker players, it is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> keep the king well away from the rook. Relatedly, the static vs ranging classification corresponds to castle development: static rook positions tend to have castles {{on the left side of}} the board while ranging rook positions tend to have castles on the right side.|$|E
25|$|By the 1966-67 season, the {{interest}} in cricket in India had risen to unprecedented levels. Despite being beaten by the West Indies at home, the Indian team's spirits were not dampened. The captain Nawab of Pataudi {{thought that it would}} be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> introduce more quality spinners into the team in order to compensate for the absence of good new-ball bowlers in the country. Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, the leg spinner, had already established his place in the team with solid performances against Australia and the West Indies. Erapalli Prasanna was making him comeback having been out of the team for five years, while both Venkatarghavan and Bedi played in the series against West Indies. All four of them played their first (and only game together) against England at Birmingham in the summer of 1967. Prasanna and Chandrasekhar impressed in that game, claiming 7 and 6 wickets respectively, and all four bowlers bowled a tight line. Even though these four bowlers continued to play for 11 more years, this remained the only Test where all of them featured in the Indian test XI.|$|E
25|$|The police {{plan was}} to move in at midnight on September 14 and evict the house while the squatters were still in their beds. In past evictions, the police did not assault a house until long after {{the moment of the}} deadline, and the hope was to take the squatters by {{surprise}} and minimize the time available for them to prepare their defense. A couple of days before the eviction was to take place, posters were hung up all over the city. The posters invited people to come to a demonstration in support of the house. The poster showed a large image of a burning car and the text said that it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> show up with your face masked. This did raise some eyebrows at police headquarters, but in the end the police estimated that it was just a coincidence and that nothing big was underway. The police also thought that since the demonstration was held at 10:00 pm on a Sunday, not many people would attend.|$|E

25|$|The Intelligence to Prevent Terrorism Act was {{introduced}} to the Senate on September 28 by Senators Bob Graham (D-FL) and Jay Rockefeller (D-WV). The bill proposed a number of changes relating to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). The most significant change proposed was to require the Attorney General or head of any other Federal department or agency to disclose to the DCI any foreign intelligence acquired {{in the course of a}} criminal investigation. However, it would also have required that the DCI and Secretary of the Treasury jointly report to Congress as to whether it would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> reconfigure the Office of Foreign Assets Control and its Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center to provide for the analysis and dissemination of foreign intelligence relating to the financial capabilities and resources of international terrorist organizations. It would also have required the DCI to establish and maintain a National Virtual Translation Center for timely and accurate translations of foreign intelligence for elements of the intelligence community. Another area it covered was a proposal to make the Attorney General provide a program of training to Government officials regarding the identification and use of foreign intelligence.|$|E

500|$|In the series' plot, Trudy {{was killed}} years prior its first episode, which led Monk to develop obsessive–compulsive {{disorder}} {{and to be}} discharged from the San Francisco Police Department.

500|$|Writing in 2011, Jörg Muth {{concluded}} that [...] "At Fort Leavenworth, school solutions {{were always the}} norm. Ineffective courses were led by instructors who sometimes lacked knowledge of their fields and usually failed in didactics and pedagogics... It seems in general {{not to have been}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> challenge the instructors at Leavenworth in any way if an officer student wanted to leave the school with a respectable grade." [...] While the education system [...] undoubtedly failed in some key areas, it did create a body of competent division and corps commanders.|$|E
500|$|David McNaughton argues that, {{even if the}} agent's {{commitment}} to his/her principles is not undermined, two-level utilitarianism does not succeed in its goal of showing, [...] "how, on utilitarian principles, it is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> think and reason in a pluralist and non-consequentialist manner." [...] It is impossible, he claims, to compartmentalise one's thinking {{in the way the}} two-level account requires—to simultaneously think like a utilitarian and act in a non-utilitarian way. Hare's response to this type of criticism is that he does his own moral thinking in this way, therefore the challenge that this type of moral thinking is impossible must be false.|$|E
