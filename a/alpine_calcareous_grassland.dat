40|$|In {{the face}} of ongoing habitat fragmentation, species–area {{relationships}} (SARs) have gained renewed interest and are increasingly used to set conservation priorities. An important question is how large habitat areas need to be to optimize biodiversity conservation. The relationship between area and species richness is explained by colonization–extinction dynamics, whereby smaller sites harbor smaller populations, which {{are more prone to}} extinction than the larger populations sustained by larger sites. These colonization– extinction dynamics are predicted to vary with trophic rank, habitat affinity, and dispersal ability of the species. However, empirical evidence for the effect of these species characteristics on SARs remains inconclusive. In this study we used carabid beetle data from 58 <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> sites to investigate how <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> area affects species richness and activity density for species differing in trophic rank, habitat affinity, and dispersal ability. In addition, we investigated how SARs are affected by the availability of additional <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> in the surrounding landscape. Beetle species richness and activity density increased with <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> area for zoophagous species that are specialists for dry grasslands and, to a lesser extent, for zoophagous habitat generalists. Phytophagous species and zoophagous forest andwet-grassland specialistswere not affected by <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> area. The dependence of species on large single sites increased with decreasing dispersal ability for species already vulnerable to <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> area. Additional <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> in the landscape had a positive effect on local species richness of both dry-grassland specialists and generalists, but this effect was restricted to a few hundred meters. Our results demonstrate that SARs are affected by trophic rank, habitat affinity, and dispersal ability. These species characteristics do not operate independently, but should be viewed in concert. In addition, species’ responses depend on the landscape context. Our study suggests that the impact of habitat area on trophic interactions may be larger than previously anticipated. In small habitat fragments surrounded by a hostile matrix, food chains may be strongly disrupted. This highlights the need to conserve continuous <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> patches of at least several hectares in size...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> {{recreation}} following abandonment depends {{to a large}} extent on the composition of the soil seed bank. We studied the species richness and composition of the seed bank along a chronosequence from well-developed <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> to scrub and forest vegetation, which had developed on <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> over the last 225 years. The seed bank density was highest in the <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> soils (930 seeds/m(2)). However, the seed bank was mainly composed of rather common species of nutrient poor grassland, which were poorly represented in the surface vegetation. There {{were no significant differences in}} soil seed bank density and species composition between the <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> and scrub vegetation that was less than 15 years old, largely because several grassland species had persisted in the scrub vegetation and were therefore able to replenish the soil seed bank. In contrast seed density and species richness declined significantly after 40 years of grassland abandonment. Indeed, forest soils had the lowest seed densities (214 seeds/m(2)) with only a few grassland species represented. This reflects the lack of grassland species in the field layer of the forest, and, therefore, the lack of seed production and seed bank replenishment. It is clear that recreation of <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> on long abandoned sites cannot rely on germination of target species from the seed bank alone. Even in the <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> soil, seeds of target species are not abundant as the majority produces transient seeds, which decay rapidly if they do not germinate immediately. Successful grassland recreation on such sites therefore may require seeds of target species to be introduced artificially (e. g. as seed mixtures, green hay, etc.). Alternatively, reinstatement of traditional practices, such as grazing or mowing, will increase the natural dispersal potential of these species, allowing population reestablishment in the long term.

40|$|For {{the last}} few decades, the {{interest}} in green roofs has been developing quickly because of the benefits they have on the modern urban environment situation. Recently, {{of the range of}} native habitats in the UK appropriate for green roof application, <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> plant communities have been given much attention for use on green roofs because of the similarity that these habitats have to green roof conditions. However, there has been very little or no research into how locally-characteristic habitats can be recreated on green roofs, and this has led to a lack of specific recommendations for native plant communities or assemblages on green roofs in the UK.

40|$|Cotoneaster horizontalis DECAISNE, a Rosaceae {{coming from}} Asia, was {{introduced}} in Belgium as an ornamental species. Different sides of the invasion were studied, from {{the distribution of the}} species and the invasion status, the impacts, to management methods. To describe the invasion status, information was gathered about the occurrence and the distribution of the species in Belgium by compiling various databases. The naturalization status in <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands,</b> high-value habitats recognized as biodiversity hotspots, was assessed. Occurrence, population status, preferred habitats, invaded communities, growth rate and fruiting capacity were characterized. Once naturalization established, we investigated its impacts on <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> communities, individual species and pollinators. C. horizontalis occurred in seven of the nine studied <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands,</b> with densities from 0. 34 to 10 individuals/ha. In the most invaded sites, an ongoing colonization process was suggested by a high proportion of small individuals. Moreover, 3 -year-old individuals already showed fruiting capacities. Germination rate reached about 30 %. Significant impacts on habitat structure and vegetation were showed. Community structure and composition changes were demonstrated in invaded sites by decreasing species richness and diversity. As <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> are priority Natura 2000 habitats, measures must be taken to control the spread of C. horizontalis. For this purpose, we performed management tests to identify the most efficient techniques that would help the restoration of <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands.</b> Both mechanical and chemical management techniques were tested. Methods choice was driven by the environmental constraints of <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands,</b> which require highly selective techniques, and by species characteristics. Tested methods were cuttings, stump burning, spraying, cutting plus glyphosate application on stump and glyphosate application on stem basis. Efficiency, cost, feasibility and side-effects on ecosystems were estimated. Management tests are still ongoing but some results have already been drawn: spraying and single cutting are not efficient, the last one generating production of numerous sprouts.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{long-term}} effect of an ecological network of <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands,</b> a habitat type that experienced dramatic habitat loss and fragmentation during the 20 th century. <b>Calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> are of special conservation concern as the habitat type {{with the highest}} diversity in plant and invertebrate species in Central Europe. A baseline survey in 1989 established complete vascular plant species lists for all 62 previously abandoned <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> patches {{in the study area}} and assessed the presence of 48 habitat specialist plant species. An ecological network was initiated in 1989 to reconnect these patches with existing core areas through large flock sheep herding where feasible, as sheep are thought to be the primary dispersal vectors for <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> plants. An evaluation survey in 2009 showed significant increase in species richness of habitat specialist plants in patches reconnected by sheep herding, indicating successful colonizations by habitat specialist plant species, while ungrazed patches showed no significant change. Baseline species richness after abandonment was associated with patch area and vegetation type, suggesting that extinction delays depended on asymmetry of competition with later seral species, whereas subsequent increase in species richness was related to connectivity by sheep herding and the presence of a diversity of structural elements providing microsites for establishment. The implementation of this ecological network represents a long-term ‘natural experiment’ with baseline data, manipulation, and evaluation of hypothesized effects on a clearly defined target variable. It thus provides much needed empirical evidence that species loss in fragmented <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> communities can be counteracted by restoring functional connectivity among remnant patches...|$|R

Location: Defence Training Estate Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, UK. Methods: We investigated the rate of natural regeneration of species-rich <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> across a 20 000 -ha landscape. We combined a large-scale botanical survey with historic land-use data (6 – 150 yrs before present) and examined differences between grassland age classes in the occurrence of individual plant species, plant community composition and plant community functional traits. Results: Many species {{showed a significant association}} with grasslands over 100 yrs old. These included the majority of those defined elsewhere as <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> indicators, although some appeared on grasslands < 10 yrs old. Plant community composition showed increasing similarity to the oldest grasslands with increased grassland age, with the exception of very recently ex-agricultural grasslands. Most functional traits showed clear trends with grassland age, with dispersal ability differing most strongly between recent and older grasslands, whilst soil fertility and pH tolerance were more influential over longer time-scales. Conclusions: Even in a well connected landscape, natural regeneration to a community resembling ancient <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland</b> in terms of functional traits and plant community composition takes over a century, although changes at the level of individual species may occur much earlier. These findings confirm the uniqueness of ancient <b>calcareous</b> <b>grassland.</b> They also suggest that the targets of re-establishment efforts should be adjusted to account for the likely time-scale of full community re-assembly. ...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{relative}} contribution {{of local and}} regional processes to local species richness is an important ecological questions and a subject of controversy between macroecologists and community ecologists. We test {{the hypothesis that the}} contribution of local and regional processes is dependent on environmental conditions and that the effect of regional processes should be the highest in communities from intermediate positions along environmental severity gradients due to the importance of facilitation. We used the recently developed log-ratio method to analyze the relationship between Local Species Richness (LSR) and Regional Species Richness (RSR) for 13 plant communities from 4 habitat types of France (coastal sand dunes, oceanic heathlands, <b>alpine</b> <b>grasslands,</b> lowland <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands).</b> Each habitat type was split in 3 - 4 communities using multivariate analyses to identify {{the relative}} importance of stress, disturbance, competition, and facilitation functioning within the 13 communities. We found that the LSR/RSR relationship was highly dependent on environmental conditions with saturated communities occurring more frequently than unsaturated communities highlighting the relative importance of local drivers on species richness. We argued that competition was most likely the main source of community saturation whilst facilitation likely contributed to enhancing the importance of the regional species pool for all habitat types. However, the effect of facilitation might be stronger in the disturbed than in the stressed systems because unsaturated curves were only observed in the former conditions. In extreme conditions of disturbance LSR was only controlled by the intensity of disturbance. This effect was not observed in extreme stress conditions. Our study provides support for the emerging balance theory that both local and regional processes are important in nature with their relative contribution depending on environmental conditions. Additionally, this synthesis strongly suggests that facilitation contributes to an important process - the influence of regional species pool on local species richness...|$|R

In Belgium, {{a number}} of phytosociological surveys have been realized in these habitats, but none covers {{the whole range of}} <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> at the regional scale. The aim of this study was (i) to provide a synthesis of the floristic variation of <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> of the Calestienne natural region using a uniform methodology; (ii) to relate floristic variation to environmental variables, and (iii) to characterize the specific diversity of the different grassland communities that occur in the study region. Seven different communities were identified with the TWINSPAN method. The originality of the <b>grasslands</b> on <b>calcareous</b> and calcareo-siliceous rocks was statistically confirmed. Significant differences for environmental variables were identified among the seven communities by a MANOVA. Main differences between communities were related to xericity and pH, although a north-south gradient was also identified.

Results: Both acidic and <b>calcareous</b> <b>grasslands</b> showed clear changes in species composition between the two time periods. In acidic grasslands there was no significant change in richness but there were declines in diversity. There were significant increases in Ellenberg N.
