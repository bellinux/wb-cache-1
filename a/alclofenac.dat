40|$|In view of {{the claim}} that <b>alclofenac</b> has a {{specific}} antirheumatoid action a detailed biochemical study has been made over a 6 -month period of 2 groups of patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving either <b>alclofenac</b> or D-penicillamine for the first time. We found no biochemical evidence and little clinical evidence that <b>alclofenac</b> had a 'penicillamine-like' effect in rheumatoid arthritis...|$|E
40|$|Forty-six {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis, 22 receiving D-penicillamine and 2 j <b>alclofenac,</b> {{took part in}} a 6 -month single-bind external observer trial to compare the efficacy and toxicity of these drugs in the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis. Both drugs were active and similar in their efficacy at 6 months as judged by clinical and laboratory measurements. Penicillamine was active therapeutically by 3 months, one month before <b>alclofenac.</b> 9 patients, 8 on <b>alclofenac</b> and one on D-penicillamine, had to stop treatment because of lack of effect or toxic effects. Skin rashes within the first week of treatment were a major problem with <b>alclofenac</b> and led to 6 withdrawals...|$|E
40|$|A {{double-blind}} {{cross-over study}} using a double placebo technique {{was employed to}} compare the effectiveness of daily <b>alclofenac</b> 3 g and phenylbutazone 300 mg in rheumatoid arthritis. (2) Thirty-one patients with classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis entered the trial. Twenty-three patients completed the trial; eight patients were withdrawn while on <b>alclofenac,</b> six developing a rash and two having inadequate analgesia. (3) Relief of pain on both drugs was comparable. (4) When questioned {{at the end of}} the trial, sixteen patients preferred phenylbutazone, four preferred <b>alclofenac.</b> (5) No significant changes in laboratory values were found, apart from a slight mean fall in haemoglobin on phenylbutazone.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{advantage to}} patients with chronic rheumatic diseases of an effective, non-steroidal analgesic anti-inflammatory drug which causes insignificant gastric bleecling was a decisive factor leacling {{to the introduction of}} <b>alclofenac.</b> Short-term double-blind trials showed that <b>alclofenac</b> has analgesic / anti-inflammatory activities equivalent to phenylbutazone, indomethacin and aspirin, but superior to thefenemates and propionic acid derivatives. Long-term controlled studies, ranging from 5 months to 3 Â½ years and using reliable, objective measures reveal, however, that patients with rheumatoid arthritis improve in functional status and graduate to less severe classes of disease activity, a phenomenon not observed with either indomethacin or aspirin administered to matched patients over the same periods of time. So far, clinical improvement on <b>alclofenac</b> has been matched only by treatment with gold, D-penicillamine and the immunosuppressive antiproliferative drugs. This clinical improvement on <b>alclofenac</b> is reflected in haemato-logical and serological indices, and research shows that <b>alclofenac,</b> like these other antirheumatoid drugs, has a pronounced effect upon the acute-phase protein response {{and the extent to which}} L-tryptophan is bound to plasma protein. The clinical data reviewed suggest that <b>alclofenac</b> represents an advance in the therapy of the rheumatic diseases...|$|E
40|$|Indomethacin and <b>alclofenac</b> were {{compared}} for 13 months under double-blind conditions in 109 patients with active, classical, or definite rheumatoid arthritis {{at a relatively}} early stage of the disease. Both indomethacin and <b>alclofenac</b> were clearly effective: most patients either improved or remained as well controlled as on entry. <b>Alclofenac</b> proved the more effective drug, however, producing a significantly greater reduction in morning stiffness, articular index, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and only in the alclofenac-treated group did functional capacity improve and latex-agglutination titres diminish. Comprehensive laborabory tests showed no significant deviation from normal {{which could have been}} attributed to either drug...|$|E
40|$|A {{literature}} survey {{has shown that}} some simple peptides and their derivatives and also some amino acid derivatives have pharmacological activities of interest. The thesis describes the preparation and characterisation of amino acid and thence of peptide derivatives of Aspirin, acetylsalicylic acid, and then of <b>Alclofenac,</b> 4 -allyloxy- 3 -chlorophenylacetic acid. Acetylsalicyloyl-(DL) -alanine, and some amino acid and dipeptide derivatives (and one tripeptide derivative) of <b>Alclofenac</b> were prepared. The compounds have been submitted for pharmacological testing. The results obtained todate indicate that Alclofenac-(DL) -alanine methyl ester and Alclofenac-(DL) -alanyl-(DL) -alanine methyl ester are bioactive compounds. They inhibit the release of histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. Further, Alclofenac-glycine and its hydrogenated form, 3 -chloro- 4 -n-propoxyphenylacetyl-glycine, show as much anti-inflammatory activity in vivo as does <b>Alclofenac.</b> Derivatives are named arbitrarily as, e. g. Alclofenac-glycine etc where {{the first part of}} such composite names refers strictly to the acyl radical derived from the acid, <b>Alclofenac...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{double-blind}} between-patient trial over 6 {{weeks to}} compare the effects of 1. 6 g tolmetin daily with 4 g <b>alclofenac</b> daily was completed by 37 out of 44 out-patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Tolmetin proved as effective as <b>alclofenac</b> in relieving pain and in reducing both the articular index score {{and the number of}} inflamed joints. However, <b>alclofenac</b> produced a significantly greater reduction in the duration of morning stiffness, which could have been related to the timing of the initial daily dose of tolmetin. Onset of fatigue was significantly improved by both drugs. Neither treatment group exhibited any significant changes in the serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM, nor in the latex and sheep-cell agglutination titres. Although neither drug gave rise to serious side-effects, 3 patients (2 on tolmetin, 1 on <b>alclofenac)</b> were withdrawn because of skin rash, 2 (on tolmetin) because of gastro-intestinal upsets, and I from each group because of lack of analgesic effect.

40|$|<b>Alclofenac</b> and D-penicillamine were {{compared}} under controlled, double-blind {{conditions in the}} treatment of 35 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis over a period of 26 weeks. The principal aim {{of the study was to}} investigate any relationships between changes in clinical status and changes in concentrations of three serum acute-phase proteins (fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and haptoglobin), plasma free and protein-bound L-tryptophan, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Both <b>alclofenac</b> and D-penicillamine were clearly effective: all patients showed steady improvement on the seven clinical indices of response employed. Drug management was easiest with <b>alclofenac.</b> Both drugs produced a significant reduction in acute-phase proteins, E. S. R, and protein-bound plasma tryptophan. Since it has previously been established that the course of rheumatoid arthritis is reflected in the acute-phase protein levels and the extent to which L-tryptophan is bound to plasma protein, it is suggested that drugs, such as D-penicillamine and <b>alclofenac</b> which profoundly affect these parameters, provide not only symptomatic relief but also possible beneficial effects on the disease process itself...|$|E
40|$|Two {{clinical}} studies {{were conducted to}} study the pharmacokinetics of <b>alclofenac</b> in healthy adult male volunteers when the drug was administered in both single and multiple dosing regimens. The first study involved the participation ofthirty-two subjects, each of whom receivedsingle 500 mg and 1000 mg oral doses of <b>alclofenac,</b> using a complete crossover experimental design. The second study involved the participation ofsixteen subjects, eight of whom received a 500 mg dose, and eight of whom receiveda 1000 mg dose of <b>alclofenac</b> every eight hours for ninety-six consecutive hours (four days) with no crossover. In the first study, plasma <b>alclofenac</b> levels were monitored for ten hours post-dosing, while in the second study, drug levels were monitored for four and one-halfdays (i. e. through twelve hours after the last dose). Initially, using the programme NONLIN, single dose data werefit to a bi-exponential equation, with output from these fits serving as initial estimates for a second fit to the same equation. The results of these second fits wer...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY In view of {{the claim}} that <b>alclofenac</b> has a {{specific}} antirheumatoid action a detailed biochemical study has been made over a 6 -month period of 2 groups of patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving either <b>alclofenac</b> or D-penicillamine for the first time. We found no biochemical evidence and little clinical evidence that <b>alclofenac</b> had a 'penicillamine-like ' effect in rheumatoid arthritis. <b>Alclofenac</b> * (4 -allyloxyl- 3 -chlorophenylacetic acid) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent derived from arylacetic acid. Biochemical studies have suggested, however, that this drug may have a more specific action in rheumatoid arthritis, fundamentally influencing the disease process. This evidence comes from fall in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), " 2 fall in immunoglobulins and latex agglutination titre but not in sheep cell agglutination test (SCAT) titre, 3 rise in free plasma tryptophan, ' and a rise in serum sulphydryl levels. 4 As part of a long-term study {{in which we are}} attempting to define biochemical profiles of response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated {{for the first time with}} 'specific ' drugs we have compared the majority of these biochemical changes in patients treated either with D-penicillamine or with alclo-fenac. We report these results, which are at variance with those previously described. Patients and methods All patients had classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis (American Rheumatism Association cri-teria) and moderate or severe disease activity judged by the presence of at least 3 out of: (i) tenderness of 6 joints or more; (ii) swelling of more than 3 joints; (iii) morning stiffness> 45 minutes; (iv) articular index 5 > 20; (v) ESR> 28 mm/h.

40|$|In {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis neither indomethacin nor aspirin influenced {{the levels of}} the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (e. s. r) or serum acute-phase proteins fibrinogen, haptoglobin, C-reactive protein and alphaI acid-glycoprotein). Treatment with D-penicillamine, sodium aurothiomalate, or <b>alclofenac</b> produced a significant reduction both in acute-phase protein levels and in e. s. r. Each of the drugs displaced L-tryptophan from plasma proteins in vivo but withdrawal of indomethacin and aspirin was followed immediatley by excessive binding of this amino acid to circulating proteins:this phenomenon was not observed when <b>alclofenac,</b> sodium aurothiomalate or D-penicillamine were withdrawn. It has been demonstrated that disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis is reflected in acute-phase protein concentrations and in {{the extent to which}} L-tryptophan is bount to plasma protein. It is suggested that drugs which profoundly affect these parameters provide not only symptomatic relieft but also possible beneficial effects upon the disease process itself...|$|E

40|$|There are {{reported}} cases of Renal Papillary necrosis (RPN) from aspirin usage alone, but most epidemiological studies implicate phenacetin as the toxic component.

Fluribiprofen and prednisolone were equipotent and were capable of almost completely suppressing fluid and cellular responses, while <b>alclofenac</b> was less potent at nontoxic dose levels.

40|$|While {{participating}} in a clinical trial of suprofen, a new antiphlogistic agent, a 32 -year-old atopic woman developed a severe contact dermatitis reaction of the hands to this substance. To check for cross-reactivity patterns, patch tests were performed with similar arylalcanoic acid derivatives. Positive reactions were obtained for ibuprofen, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, naproxen, <b>alclofenac,</b> and metiazinic acid, which are all antiphlogistic and anti-inflammatory agents for systemic use, and chlorambucil, which is an antineoplastic agent. The antigenic determinant seems to correspond to a very well-defined structure: the carboxyl group (-COOH) has {{to be separated from}} the aryl structure by at least one C atom (substituted or not).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} the separation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs: niflumic acid, flufenamic acid, piroxicam, <b>alclofenac,</b> tiaprofenic acid, flurbiprofen, suprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, indomethacin, carprofen, indoprofen, sulindac) in capillary electrophoresis (CE) using completely nonaqueous systems. The influence of different parameters such as nature and proportion of organic solvent (methanol, acetonitrile, 2 -propanol), apparent pH (ranging from 7 to 9) and temperature (ranging from 25 to 40 degrees C) on selectivity and migration times were studied systematically in an uncoated fused-silica capillary. A nonaqueous electrolyte made of 50 mM ammonium acetate - 13. 75 mM ammonia in methanol proved to resolve 11 NSAIDs at 25 degrees C and 13 NSAIDs at 36 degrees C, both within 13 min and without a modifier besides the methanol itself.

40|$|SEVERAL {{drugs have}} been shown to have a 'specific ' action in {{rheumatoid}} arthritis; that is, to produce a slow improvement in the disease, accompanied by a fall in the ESR and titre of rheumatoid factor, and {{reduction in the number of}} nodules. Drugs known to have this action include gold (Empire Rheumatism Council, 1961), D-penicillamine (Multicentre Trial, 1973), chloroquine (Popert et al., 1961), and some immunosuppressive agents. Recently, levamisole, widely regarded as an immunostimulant, has been shown to be superior to placebo, and similar both quantitatively and qualitatively to D-penicil-lamine in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and should be added to the list of specific drugs (Huskisson et al., 1976). A number of others are currently undergoing long-term clinical trials for specific activity, including dapsone, <b>alclofenac</b> and clotrima-zole. Many of these drugs have little or no effect in existing animal models, and many more may have been missed because of the inadequacy of the available laboratory screening tests. In view of this we have tested a number of the specific agents in some new animal models, in addition to conventional ones, using a variety of dosing regimes, in the hope that some common in vivo actions of the group might be detected.
