The police had maintained a heavy guard around the building during the ongoing strike and Sheriff Porttens had given orders to use firearms to disperse any attempt by the strikers to take the building. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> neared the building, the police opened fire. Several were injured and the crowd was driven away.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> {{began making}} their way home from Ninian Park, the news began to filter slowly out. Some Scottish fans had elected to remain in Cardiff and were celebrating the {{achievement}} of guaranteeing the play-off spot when they saw and heard what had happened. Others had boarded trains or were in cars heading home – many fans didn't hear the news until they eventually got home the following day.|$|E
5|$|Outside the temple, Nadir waits {{beside the}} funeral pyre <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> singing and dancing, anticipates the dawn {{and the coming}} double {{execution}} (""). He is joined by Leila; resigned now to their deaths, the pair sing of how their souls will soon be united in heaven. A glow appears in the sky, and Zurga rushes in to report that the fishermen's camp is ablaze. As the men hurry away to save their homes, Zurga frees Leila and Nadir. He returns the necklace to Leila, and reveals {{that he is the}} man she saved when she was a child. He recognises now that his love for her is in vain, and tells her and Nadir to flee. As the couple depart, singing of the life of love that awaits them, Zurga is left alone, to await the fishermen's return ("!").|$|E

60|$|Jet {{started at}} once, feeling decidedly hurt at the tone {{used by the}} men, and, walking <b>as</b> rapidly <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> on <b>the</b> {{sidewalk}} would permit, was soon at the appointed place.|$|R
5|$|Pearl Jam's 2000 European tour {{ended in}} tragedy on June 30, with an {{accident}} at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated to death <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> {{rushed to the}} front. After numerous requests for the crowd to step back, the band stopped playing and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians realized what was happening, but {{it was already too}} late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and members of the band contemplated retiring after this event. Pearl Jam was initially blamed for the accident, but was later cleared of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Standing {{over his}} vanquished opponent, Carrouges {{remained}} on the field <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> cheered him and pages rushed to bind his wound. He then kneeled before the King, who presented him with a prize of a thousand francs {{in addition to a}} royal income of 200 francs a year. Only then did he greet his wife, in an emotional scene before the thousands of spectators. Jean and Marguerite de Carrouges then, with the crowd following in a great procession, rode from the abbey to the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris, to give thanks for the victory.|$|E
5|$|Croatian President Franjo Tuđman {{called on}} the public to bring the siege to an end, and the plea {{resulted}} in a large-scale protest against the JNA in Split, organised by the Croatian Trade Union Association in the Brodosplit Shipyard on 6 May 1991. On 7 May, 80 tanks and tracked vehicles and 23 wheeled vehicles of the JNA 10th Motorised Brigade left barracks in Mostar, only to be stopped by civilians ahead of Široki Brijeg, west of Mostar. The convoy remained in place for three days <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> demanded that the JNA lift the siege of Kijevo. The protest ended after Alija Izetbegović, the President of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, visited and addressed the protesters, assuring the crowd that the convoy was heading to Kupres rather than Kijevo. Tuđman and Cardinal Franjo Kuharić sent telegrams to the protesters supporting Izetbegović. The siege of Kijevo was lifted through negotiations a few days later, {{two weeks after the}} blockade had been imposed.|$|E
50|$|Gradually {{more of the}} mob join him, {{the other}} actors return to the stage, and the film ends with Ned hearing his late wife {{speaking}} part of Juliet's soliloquy <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd's</b> approval continues to rise.|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} works which show flashes of {{innovation}} such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> chorus decorating duomo of Santa Maria dei Miracoli in Saronno or his fresco of St Anne. This painting shows the overlap of Milanese realism and Venetian colorism.|$|R

5|$|They {{defeated}} the Welsh team from Oswestry {{in the third}} round, 7–1. They were drawn at home against Aston Villa in the fourth round, but the match was called into doubt when it was scheduled to {{take place on the}} same date and location as Queen's Park's match against Hibernian F.C. in the Scottish Cup. But Queen's and their Scottish opponents agreed to postpone the match for two weeks. There {{was a great deal of}} interest by the spectators from Birmingham, and three special trains were laid on to transport them to Glasgow for the game with more than 1200 of them travelling north of the border. Around 10,000 fans filled the ground where they watched Queen's Park defeat Aston Villa 6–1. The fifth round was their lowest scoring game of the campaign, where they won away to Old Westminsters 1–0 at the Kennington Oval in London. In the semi-final they defeated Blackburn Olympic 4–1 to set up a final against the other Blackburn-based team; the match was played at a neutral venue in Nottingham. Olympic subsequently complained to The Football Association <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> invaded the pitch to cause disruption for their team; the complaint was not upheld.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{entering}} Philo's penthouse suite, Lenny finds another SQUID disc and Philo's {{body on the}} floor, whose {{brain has}} been damaged {{in the same manner}} as Tick's. After watching the disc, Lenny discovers that Max and Faith have become lovers and that they forced Philo to run an amplified recording of them having sex. Max and Faith then enter the room, explaining that they set Philo up because he wanted to have Faith killed for what she knew about Jeriko's death, and that he now intends to frame Lenny for Philo's murder. After a hand-to-hand fight, Lenny throws Max off the balcony to his death. Meanwhile, on the street, Mace is pursued by Steckler and Engelman, but she manages to subdue them with the help of Strickland, who saw the proof behind Jeriko's death. Lenny then finds Mace and the two share a passionate kiss <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> celebrates the turn of the new century around them.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{go looking}} for Pollidori Sr. and find a shallow grave and {{photographs}} of the dead man with Mutato. Meanwhile, Dr. Pollidori leads an angry mob of townspeople to his father's house, demanding that Mulder and Scully turn the alleged murderer over to them. The agents find Mutato hiding in the basement <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> gathers upstairs. Someone accidentally sets the barn alight and in the ensuing confusion, the mob realize that the agents are protecting the monster in the basement. Mutato speaks to the crowd and explains that he was created 25years before, {{and that he is}} the result of a genetic experiment by Dr. Pollidori. Unbeknownst to his son, Pollidori Sr. rescued Mutato and cared for him, but was unable to provide a friend or a mate for the boy. The old man attempted to emulate his scientist son's experiments, and tried to create hybrids from his farm animals. Mutato asks Dr. Pollidori to create a female companion for him, but the scientist says that he cannot—that Mutato was a mistake. The townspeople realize that The Great Mutato is not a monster after all and Dr. Pollidori is arrested for the murder of his father. Mulder feels that it is unjust for Mutato not to get a mate and so he demands to see the writer: Izzy. In a fanciful, if not imagined, scene, Mulder and Scully take matters into their own hands and take Mutato, along with the townspeople, to a Cher concert. The episode ends with a shot of Mulder and Scully dancing, which slowly turns back into the comic book seen at the beginning of the episode.|$|E

25|$|His {{dream of}} {{directing}} a play of 5000 cast members materialised at the Amphi Africa Theater {{when he was}} being put to rest <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> was drawn to a manuscript of the day's program outline.

50|$|Things {{came to a}} head in 1994-96, {{after the}} event swelled to 250,000 people from around <b>the</b> country, and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> grew larger, so did the problems.

50|$|Jesus and {{his disciples}} make his Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> {{celebrate}} and lay palm branches before him ("We Cry Hosanna, Lord").
