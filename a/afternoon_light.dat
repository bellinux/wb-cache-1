500|$|Writing in A Moveable Feast, Hemingway remembered [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", recalling when he [...] "sat in {{a corner}} with the <b>afternoon</b> <b>light</b> coming in over my {{shoulder}} and wrote in the notebook.... When I stopped writing I {{did not want to}} leave the river where I could see the trout in the pool, its surface pushing and swelling smooth against the resistance of the log-driven piles of the bridge. The story was about coming back from the war but {{there was no mention of}} the war in it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{ambulance}} carrying McKinley {{reached the}} Exposition hospital at 4:25p.m. [...] Although it usually dealt {{only with the}} minor medical issues of fairgoers, the hospital did have an operating theatre. [...] At {{the time of the}} shooting, no fully qualified doctor was at the hospital, only nurses and interns. [...] The best surgeon in the city, and the Exposition's medical director, Dr. Roswell Park, was in Niagara Falls, performing a delicate neck operation. [...] When interrupted during the procedure on September 6 to be told he was needed in Buffalo, he responded that he could not leave, even for the President of the United States. [...] He was then told who had been shot. [...] Park, two weeks later, would save the life of a woman who suffered injuries almost identical to McKinley's. [...] The first physician to arrive at the hospital was Dr. Herman Mynter, whom the President had met briefly the previous day; the wounded McKinley (who had a good memory for faces) joked that when he had met Mynter, he had not expected to need his professional services. [...] As McKinley lay on the operating table, he stated of Czolgosz, [...] "He didn't know, poor fellow, what he was doing. [...] He couldn't have known." [...] With Park unavailable and with the fading <b>afternoon</b> <b>light</b> the major source of illumination in the operating room, when another surgeon, Dr. Matthew D. Mann arrived, {{the decision was made to}} operate at once to try to remove the remaining bullet. [...] Mynter had given McKinley an injection of morphine and strychnine to ease his pain; Mann (a noted gynecologist without experience in abdominal wounds) administered ether to sedate McKinley as the wounded man murmured the Lord's Prayer.|$|E

2500|$|Sorolla painted two masterpieces in 1897 linking art and science: Portrait of Dr. Simarro at the {{microscope}} and A Research. These paintings were {{presented at the}} National Exhibition of Fine Arts held in Madrid in that year and [...] Sorolla won the Prize of Honor. Here, he presents his friend Simarro {{as a man of}} science who transmits his wisdom investigating and, in addition, it is the triumph of naturalism, as it recreates the indoor environment of the laboratory, catching the luminous atmosphere produced by the artificial reddish-yellow light of a gas burner that contrasts with the weak mauvish <b>afternoon</b> <b>light</b> that shines through the window. These paintings may be among the most outstanding world paintings of this genre.|$|E

5000|$|Webb Field was renovated and [...] "rededicated" [...] for {{the season}} {{football}} opener in September 1935 against Charlotte Central, which Concord won in a 49-12 rout. From 1924 to 1955, football games were usually played on Friday <b>afternoons.</b> <b>Lights</b> were installed at the stadium for the 1956-57 school year. Concord High football teams played at Webb Field through the 1966 season, until {{the opening of the}} new Burrage Road high school. Concord baseball teams continued to make Webb Field their home for another 25 years, and the facility (originally featuring a grandstand) also saw minor-league baseball for several decades with the Concord Weavers in the 1930s and 1940s. Webb Field is now on the National Register of Historic Places study list).|$|R

60|$|Shining aslant {{into this}} wild hollow, the <b>afternoon</b> sun <b>lighted</b> up its eastern side with tints of gold. But opposite, brooded a somber shadow, double-shading the secret places between the salient spurs of the mountains. Thus cut in twain by masses {{of day and}} night, {{it seemed as if}} some Last Judgment had been enacted in the glen.|$|R

The bell tower is also illuminated by more colorful lights, sometimes even decorated. The whole mountains are sometimes illuminated too.|$|R
5000|$|A cream tea (also {{known as}} a Cornish cream tea or Devon cream tea [...] )is a form of <b>afternoon</b> tea <b>light</b> meal, {{consisting}} of tea taken {{with a combination of}} scones, clotted cream, and jam.

60|$|When she returned, in {{the yellow}} <b>afternoon</b> <b>light</b> that flowed over wood and pasture, {{he came out of}} the tannery door. Jake Wheeler or Speedy Bates, the {{journeyman}} tailoress, from whom little escaped, could not have said it was by design--thought nothing, indeed, of that part of it.|$|E
60|$|The lift was {{too slow}} for him. He opened his door with almost breathless haste. He only paused {{to light a}} {{cigarette}} and change his coat and wheel his table round so as to catch the <b>afternoon</b> <b>light</b> more perfectly. Then, with his brain teeming with fancies, he plunged into his work.|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} they were slipping down the Alps towards Turin. And everywhere was snow--deep, white, wonderful snow, beautiful and fresh, glistening in the <b>afternoon</b> <b>light</b> all {{down the mountain}} slopes, on the railway track, almost seeming to touch the train. And twilight was falling. And at the stations people crowded in once more.|$|E
5000|$|In 1851 the Sunday School had 534 {{children}} attending on Sunday {{mornings and}} 625 in the <b>afternoon.</b> Gas <b>lighting</b> was {{introduced into the}} Chapel in 1846. Revd James Mursell, whose ministry began in March 1853, had an [...] "exciting and innovative" [...] ministry. It was during his time that the new chapel was built. The Fuller Chapel, as it was named, opened for worship on 24 September 1861.|$|R
50|$|The Springthorpe Memorial in the Boroondara Cemetery, Kew, was Desbrowe-Annear's first Arts and Crafts venture. The {{design was}} {{influenced}} by William Lethaby’s writings on the iconography of the domed temple form in “Architecture: Mysticism & Myth”. Consequentially the architecture is symbolic. The geographic alignment of the tomb ascertains that the intense <b>light</b> of the <b>afternoon</b> sun <b>lights</b> up the temple with brilliant colour. It explores {{the idea of the}} hoped-for union of souls.|$|R
6000|$|Toward the <b>afternoon</b> the <b>light</b> cart {{from the}} {{farmhouse}} came to fetch {{us and our}} things to Appletreewick. It was quite a warm spring day, and I had another pang to bear as I saw poor William helped into the cart, looking so sickly and sad, with his miserable green shade, in the cheerful sunlight. [...] "God only knows, Leah, how this will succeed with us," [...] he said, as we started; then sighed, and fell silent again.|$|R
60|$|Crecy was {{gradually}} fading into the distance, {{wrapped in a}} mantle of damp and mist. For a long while Marguerite could see the sloping slate roofs glimmering like steel in the grey <b>afternoon</b> <b>light,</b> and the quaint church tower with its beautiful lantern, through the pierced stonework of which shone patches of the leaden sky.|$|E
60|$|Earnestly {{she studied}} the lines of her face, covered {{incipient}} wrinkles and faded cheeks with cosmetics, spent nigh on {{an hour in the}} arrangement of her coif. Then she repaired to a small room, which was hung with tapestry of a dull red, and into which the fading <b>afternoon</b> <b>light</b> would only peep very gently and discreetly.|$|E
60|$|Her {{sentence}} {{concluded with}} a little note of dismay. Mannering was positively haggard in the clear <b>afternoon</b> <b>light.</b> There were lines underneath his eyes, and his face had a tense, drawn appearance. He did not kiss her, as she had more than half expected. He held her hands for a moment, and then sank down upon the couch by her side.|$|E
60|$|The {{resolution}} was adhered to; and all waited anxiously {{for the news}} next day. Their suspense was diverted, however, by a discovery which {{was made in the}} <b>afternoon,</b> throwing more <b>light</b> on Boldwood's conduct and condition than any details which had preceded it.|$|R
60|$|They hurried on, and {{discovered}} {{only a few}} skins in the first tent. Then, separating, they eagerly searched the rest without result, and when they met again were forced {{to the conclusion that}} there was no food in the place. It was about three o'clock and a threatening <b>afternoon.</b> The <b>light</b> was dim and a savage wind blew the snow about. They stood with gloomy faces in the shelter of the largest tepee, feeling that luck was hard against them.|$|R
6000|$|At {{last one}} {{afternoon}} they had climbed together the steep red {{face of the}} sandy slope that rises abruptly from the Holmwood towards Leith Hill, by the Robin Gate entrance. Near the top, they had seated themselves on a carpet of sheep-sorrel, looking out across the imperturbable expanse of the Weald, and the broad pastures of Sussex. A solemn blue haze brooded soft over the land. The sun was sinking low; oblique <b>afternoon</b> <b>lights</b> flooded the distant South Downs. Their combes came out aslant in saucer-shaped shadows. Alan turned and gazed at Herminia; she was hot with climbing, and her calm face was flushed. A town-bred girl would have looked red and blowsy; but the color and the exertion just suited Herminia. On that healthy brown cheek it seemed natural to discern the visible marks of effort. Alan gazed {{at her with a}} sudden rush of untrammelled feeling. The elusive outline of her grave sweet face, the wistful eyes, the ripe red mouth enticed him. [...] "Oh, Herminia," [...] he cried, calling {{her for the first time}} by her Christian name alone, [...] "how glad I am I happened to go that afternoon to Mrs. Dewsbury's. For otherwise perhaps I might never have known you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't it a wonderful, spot?" [...] she exclaimed, gazing {{off down}} the swale, emerald green in the <b>afternoon</b> <b>light</b> between its forest walls. In the distance, Silver Brook was gleaming amidst the meadows. They sat {{down on one of}} the benches and watched the groups of players pass. Mr. Spence {{produced}} his cigarette case, and presented it to her playfully.|$|E
60|$|Then the {{elephants}} were chained by their hind legs to their big stumps of pickets, and extra ropes were fitted {{to the new}} elephants, and the fodder was piled before them, and the hill drivers went back to Petersen Sahib through the <b>afternoon</b> <b>light,</b> telling the plains drivers to be extra careful that night, and laughing when the plains drivers asked the reason.|$|E

Against the stretch of water, where a school of {{mackerel}} twinkled in the <b>afternoon</b> <b>light,</b> was defined, {{in addition to the}} distant lighthouse, a church with its tower, standing {{about a quarter of a}} mile off, near the edge of the cliff. The churchyard gravestones could be seen in profile against the same vast spread of watery babble and unrest.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{a week of}} upkeep, Biloxi sortied on 13 April with TG 58.1 for the Hollandia operation.

50|$|The {{best time}} to take window light {{portrait}} {{is considered to be}} early hours of the day and late hours of <b>afternoon</b> when <b>light</b> is more intense on the window. Curtains, reflectors, and intensity reducing shields are used to give soft light. While mirrors and glasses can be used for high key lighting. At times colored glasses, filters and reflecting objects can be used to give the portrait desired color effects. The composition of shadows and soft light gives window light portraits a distinct effect different from portraits made from artificial lights.|$|R
50|$|Practice summary: The final {{full day}} of {{practice}} was held before pole qualifying. Two significant crashes occurred. At 12:30 p.m., rookie Robert Doornbos went high and crashed into the wall in turn two. The car continued to slide down the backstretch. About two hours later, Scott Sharp lost the back end in the southchute, and crashed hard in turn two. Both drivers climbed from their cars. Largely aided by a tow, both Penske cars broke the 225 mph barrier. Midway through the <b>afternoon,</b> a <b>light</b> shower delayed practice for one hour.|$|R
