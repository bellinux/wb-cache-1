5|$|Prior {{to modern}} {{settlement}} in villages, the nomadic indigenous peoples of Ethiopia provided easy hunting {{grounds for the}} bushcrow <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left</b> loose, dung-covered soil behind as they moved their cattle.

5|$|After the Hessians {{entered the}} fort, the American {{officers}} attempted to placate the Hessian commander, Captain von Malmburg, {{who was in}} charge of the surrender. They invited him into their barracks, and offered him punch, wine, cake, with compliments. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>left</b> the fort, the Hessians stripped the American troops of their baggage and beat some of them. Their officers intervened to prevent further injuries or deaths. The British captured thirty-four cannons, two howitzers, along with many tents, blankets, tools and much ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Ballast Point got {{its name}} from the {{practice}} of ships discarding their ballast there on arriving in San Diego Bay and taking on ballast <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left</b> for the open ocean. Fort Guijarros was constructed at Ballast Point in 1797. Ballast Point and La Playa are now on the grounds of Naval Base Point Loma.|$|E
5|$|However, the Guatemalan {{group was}} not granted {{the power to}} arrest or search house of {{prominent}} government officials who had served under Árbenz. This was largely because Armas and other military leaders lacked trust in the Comité. Nevertheless, the Comité was able to conduct personal searches of exiles <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left</b> the country. This proved to be ineffective as very few documents proved to be revealing.|$|E

5|$|The Royalist {{commander}} of the castle, William Edgecumbe, retreated from the castle on 19 April and the defenders blew up part of the site <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left,</b> leaving the remains to the Parliamentary commander Colonel George Fleetwood. Some of the castle's stonework {{appears to have been}} reused {{in the construction of the}} new Cromwell's Castle by the Parliamentarians, just beneath King Charles's Castle, the new fortification being sited in a much better position to defend the harbour.|$|E
5|$|After Naylor {{was brought}} home, the mob {{attacked}} the church, damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was {{brought from the}} wharfs and fired at the church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left,</b> some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced {{its way into the}} church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and the mob left the church.|$|E
5|$|As in the {{previous}} years, there were two classes of cyclists, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant {{that they had to}} finish the race on the same bicycle <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left,</b> and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance. The coureurs de vitesse could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.|$|E

5|$|At {{its sixth}} annual {{convention}} in Vavuniya on 25 May 1958 ITAK resolved {{to launch a}} non-violent campaign of civil disobedience to achieve its goals. In May and June 1958 Ceylon witnessed anti-Tamil rioting. Bandaranaike blamed ITAK for precipitating the violence and banned the party along with the Jathika Vimukthi Peramuna (National Liberation Front). ITAK's leaders, including Chelvanayakam, were arrested on 4 June 1958 <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left</b> Parliament and imprisoned. The ITAK leaders were placed under house arrest which meant that Chelvanayakam could not communicate with the public until late 1958 when the detention order was lifted.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn Rovers {{were seeking}} {{to emulate the}} success of rivals Blackburn Olympic, who were the current holders of the trophy, and the team that Queen's Park {{defeated}} in the semi-final. Rovers had previously reached the FA Cup final, in 1882, where they were defeated by Old Etonians. Blackburn trained during the week prior to the game by conducting practise games and going for walks. They departed for the London area by train {{on the day before}} the final; a large crowd of local supporters gathered at the train station in Blackburn to wish them well <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left.</b> The team stayed in Richmond the night before the match and made their way into the city at lunchtime on the Saturday.|$|E
5|$|Defendants Irving Potash and Benjamin J. Davis {{were among}} the {{audience}} members attacked <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left</b> a September 4 concert headlined by Paul Robeson in Peekskill, New York. It was given to benefit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), which was funding the defendants' legal expenses. Hundreds lined the roads leaving the performance grounds and threw rocks and bottles at the departing vehicles without interference by the police. Over 140 people suffered injuries, including Potash, whose eyes were struck by glass from a broken windshield. The trial was suspended for two days while Potash recovered from his injuries.|$|E

5|$|However, the Ngô {{brothers}} were not therethey had escaped from Gia Long Palace via a secret tunnel to a safehouse in Cholon the previous night. Diệm and Nhu had communicated with the generals via a direct phone link from the safehouse to the palace, giving the false {{impression that they}} were still besieged. Having been informed of Diệm and Nhu’s whereabouts, Minh dispatched a group of officers and troopswhich included Nhungto arrest them. He was aware that the brothers had left the safehouse to go to St. Francis Xavier's Church. Led by General Mai Hữu Xuân, the officers took an M113 armored personnel carrier (APC), four jeeps, and several soldiers to Cholon. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>left,</b> Minh gestured to Nhung with two fingers, taken to be an order to shoot the brothers.|$|E
5|$|Occupying {{the extreme}} eastern {{position}} of the blockade, Indiana fired at the cruisers Infanta María Teresa and Almirante Oquendo <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left</b> the harbor, but, due to engine problems, was unable {{to keep up with}} the Spanish cruisers as they fled to the west. When the Spanish destroyers Plutón and Furor emerged, Indiana was near the harbor entrance and, together with Iowa, she supported the armed yacht Gloucester in the destruction of the lightly armored enemy ships. She was then ordered to keep up the blockade of the harbor in case more Spanish ships came out and so played no role in the chase and sinking of the two remaining Spanish cruisers, Vizcaya and Cristóbal Colón.|$|E

His family and friends, however, held a funeral for him at the Santa Cruz funeral home in Altozano, Morelia. They did not comment where the corpse was to be taken, but unconfirmed reports suggested that there were plans to cremate him and scatter his ashes at a village in the Tierra Caliente region in Michoacán.|$|E

5|$|The OKL was {{not happy}} about {{supporting}} Cerberus. Jeschonnek remarked to Galland that if Cerberus failed then the Luftwaffe would be made a scapegoat. Jeschnonnek was to be proved right. During the 12 January 1942 meeting, the Navy demanded maximum fighter cover be given and won Hitler's support. Should anything go wrong, the Navy would most likely blame the Luftwaffe for damage sustained by enemy air forces. During the meeting Jeschonnek stood his ground and refused to give any guarantees or to reinforce the Western Fighter Forces from other theatres. Galland was given executive power for the air operation which was given the code name Unternehmen Donnerkeil (Operation Thunderbolt). The existence of the operation was so secret that both Jeschonnek and Galland had to sign secrecy pledges <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left</b> Hitler's Headquarters in East Prussia.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{an incident}} {{occurred at the}} Gotta Go convenience store, outside Jena in unincorporated LaSalle Parish, between Matt Windham and three black youths, including Bailey. Law enforcement reported that their accounts contradicted each other. Windham alleged that Bailey and his friends chased him, that he ran to get his gun, and that the students wrestled it away from him. According to the black students, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>left</b> the convenience store, they were confronted by Windham with a shotgun. They said they wrestled the gun {{away from him and}} fled the scene. Bailey was charged with disturbing the peace, second-degree robbery, and theft of a firearm.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>left,</b> {{thousands}} of National Guardsmen {{who had heard}} the news were assembling at the Place de Grève. The Marquis de Lafayette, in Paris as their commander-in-chief, discovered to his dismay that his soldiers were largely {{in favor of the}} march and were being egged on by agitators to join in. Even though he was one of France's greatest war heroes, Lafayette could not dissuade his troops and they began threatening to desert. Rather than see them leave as another anarchic mob, the Parisian municipal government told Lafayette to guide their movements; they also instructed him to request that the king return voluntarily to Paris to satisfy the people. Sending a swift horseman forward to warn Versailles, Lafayette contemplated the near mutiny of his men: he was aware that many of them had openly promised to kill him if he did not lead or get out of the way. At four o'clock in the afternoon, fifteen thousand guards with several thousand more civilian latecomers set off for Versailles. Lafayette reluctantly took his place at the head of their column, hoping to protect the king and public order.|$|E
