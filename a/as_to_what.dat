5|$|A battle {{certainly}} ensued {{although there}} are naturally two accounts <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> actually took place. According to the Burmese chronicles, the Burmese command fielded an army led by Thado Dhamma Yaza, the Viceroy of Prome, as a decoy and the two armies lurked on the flanks in order to encircle any overstretched Siamese forces. As planned, the Siamese vanguard troops pressed on Thado Dhamma Yaza's army, allowing Bayinnaung's army waiting on the left flank to encircle the Siamese forces, which subsequently were wiped out. Tabinshwehti's army on the right flank drove back the remaining Siamese forces into the city.|$|E

5|$|Enzymes must bind their {{substrates}} {{before they}} can catalyse any chemical reaction. Enzymes are usually very specific <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> substrates they bind and then the chemical reaction catalysed. Specificity is achieved by binding pockets with complementary shape, charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics to the substrates. Enzymes can therefore distinguish between very similar substrate molecules to be chemoselective, regioselective and stereospecific.|$|E
5|$|Even {{classical}} historians, {{who were}} writing only {{years after the}} events themselves, seem to be divided <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> the motives of Spartacus were.

If Spartacus did intend to march on Rome, it was a goal he must have later abandoned. Plutarch writes that Spartacus merely wished to escape northwards into Cisalpine Gaul and disperse his men back to their homes.|$|E

The drama focused on a British married couple, whose son goes missing while they are on holiday in France, and the subsequent years of enquiry trying to find answers <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> happened to their son and why. Incidentally, Nesbitt and Karyo had appeared previously together in the Martin Sheen film The Way (2010).|$|E
5|$|In April–May 2012, {{a team of}} archaeologists {{unearthed}} {{a previously}} unknown inscription on a stairway at the La Corona site in Guatemala.
