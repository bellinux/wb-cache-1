5|$|Arghezi's texts for Seara {{were largely}} unknown to later generations. They again saw print in 2003, in a {{critical}} edition co-edited by daughter Mitzura Arghezi (Domnica Theodorescu) and Traian Radu. According to philogist Gheorghe Pienescu, who collected and reedited the texts for printing in the 1960s, the copies were taken from him under false pretense by Mitzura Arghezi, <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>returned.</b> As an additional contribution to Romanian literature, Searas popularization of the expression craii de Curtea-Veche may have inspired Mateiu Caragiale in writing his celebrated 1929 novel.|$|E

5|$|Benjamin Lewis Crosby, Jr. (March 22, 1868 – December 29, 1892) was an American {{football}} player, coach, and law student. Born in Halcott Centre, New York, Crosby attended Yale University {{beginning in}} 1889; while there, {{he was a}} popular student and sportsman. He was a two-year starter {{on the football team}} and a backup on the crew team. During his junior year, he was replaced on the football team by freshman Frank Hinkey <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>returned</b> to a starting position. The remainder of Crosby's time at Yale was successful and he enrolled at the New York Law School after graduation.|$|E
5|$|In June 1873, Lee left Dublin for London <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>returned.</b> A {{fortnight}} later, Bessie followed him; the {{two girls}} joined her. Shaw's explanation of why his mother followed Lee was that without the latter's financial contribution the joint household had to be broken up. Left in Dublin with his father, Shaw compensated {{for the absence of}} music in the house by teaching himself to play the piano.|$|E
5|$|Piru Singh {{was born}} on 20 May 1918, in village Beri, Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan. He {{was the son of}} Lal Singh. His family {{consisted}} of seven children—three brothers and four sisters—with Singh being the youngest son. As a young boy, Singh always hated school, as he was unable to cope with the restricted environment. One day, after being scolded by his class teacher for quarreling with one of his classmates, Singh ran away, <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>returned</b> to school. After that, Singh continued to help his parents in their farm, and grew up to be well-built and handsome youth. Shikar, a local Indian sport, was his favourite game. Though Singh wanted to join the army from his childhood, he was rejected twice, as he was too young, before he was accepted at the age of eighteen.|$|E

5|$|Suspicions soon arose that Bogdan-Pitești {{had become}} a veritable agent of influence. According to Zambaccian, it was Bogdan-Pitești who {{actually}} dropped a hint that his support for Germany was a lucrative employment. Through various notes in scattered diaries, most {{of which have been}} lost, Caragiale reputedly accused Bogdan-Pitești taking Germany's money to promote her interests in Romania, and to assist her foreign propaganda effort. Such assessments, like Caragiale's allegation that Bogdan-Pitești was not knowledgeable in art, reflected conflicts between the two figures, and their overall reliability remains doubtful. It is however possible that Caragiale himself borrowed, <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>returned,</b> some 10,000 lei, siphoned out of the German propaganda funds by Bogdan-Pitești.|$|E
5|$|The Early English Gothic chapel of Lambeth Palace {{dates from}} work carried out while Boniface was archbishop. Boniface left England in November 1268, <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>returned.</b> He died 18 July 1270, in Savoy. He was buried {{with his family}} in the Cistercian abbey of Hautecombe in Savoy. In his will, he left {{legacies}} to all the houses of the Franciscans and Dominicans in the diocese of Canterbury. His will had differing provisions for his burial depending on whether he died in England, France, or near the Alps. Oddly enough, his official seal included a head of the pagan god Jupiter Serapis along with the usual depiction of the archbishop in full vestments.|$|E
5|$|The {{death toll}} of the Bersiap period {{runs into the}} tens of thousands. The bodies of 3,600 Indo-Europeans have been {{identified}} as killed. However more than 20,000 registered Indo-European civilians were abducted <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>returned.</b> The Indonesian revolutionaries lost at least 20,000, often young, fighting men. Estimates of the number of Indonesian fighters killed in the lead up and during the Battle of Surabaya range from 6,300 to 15,000. The Japanese forces lost around 1,000 soldiers and the British forces registered 660 soldiers, mostly British Indians, as killed (with a similar number missing in action). The actual Dutch military were hardly involved, as they only started to return to Indonesia in March and April 1946.|$|E

5|$|The impasse {{is broken}} by the return of Miss Prism, whom Lady Bracknell {{recognises}} as the person who, twenty-eight years earlier, as a family nursemaid, had taken a baby boy {{for a walk in}} a perambulator (baby carriage) <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>returned.</b> Challenged, Miss Prism explains that she had absentmindedly put the manuscript of a novel she was writing in the perambulator, and the baby in a handbag, which she had left at Victoria Station. Jack produces the very same handbag, showing that he is the lost baby, the elder son of Lady Bracknell's late sister, and thus Algernon's elder brother. Having acquired such respectable relations, he is acceptable as a suitor for Gwendolen after all.|$|E
5|$|Anna Louise Mohan {{was born}} in 1885 in San Francisco, California. Her father, Hugh Mohan, born in Pennsylvania, became a {{journalist}} and stump speaker involved in labor issues and Democratic Party politics. Moving to San Francisco, he continued to write for newspapers, and in 1880 he married Louisa Flick, {{who grew up on}} the ranch of her stepfather, James Say, near Humboldt Lake in Nevada. The Mohans had two children, Barbara (1880) and Louis (1882), before the birth of Anna Louise. Later in 1885, the family moved to Reno, where Mohan continued his journalistic career but drank heavily. One day he departed <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>returned</b> to his wife and children. Louise's mother divorced him in 1889 and married Sheridan Bryant, a freight conductor on the Southern Pacific railway. The couple had two children, Floyd (1894) and William (1896). Although the family lived in Wadsworth, Nevada, Louise accepted an invitation from James Say to live at his ranch. She remained there for three or four years, returning to Wadsworth at her mother's insistence at the age of 12. Bryant adopted her stepfather's last name, but never changed it legally from Mohan.|$|E
5|$|Warfare was {{prevalent}} in the Maya world. Military campaigns were launched {{for a variety of}} reasons, including the control of trade routes and tribute, raids to take captives, scaling up to the complete destruction of an enemy state. Little is known about Maya military organization, logistics, or training. Warfare is depicted in Maya art from the Classic period, and wars and victories are mentioned in hieroglyphic inscriptions. Unfortunately, the inscriptions do not provide information upon the causes of war, or the form it took. In the 8th–9th centuries, intensive warfare resulted in the collapse of the kingdoms of the Petexbatún region of western Petén. The rapid abandonment of Aguateca by its inhabitants has provided a rare opportunity to examine the remains of Maya weaponry in situ. Aguateca was stormed by unknown enemies around 810 AD, who overcame its formidable defences and burned the royal palace. The elite inhabitants of the city either fled or were captured, <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>returned</b> to collect their abandoned property. The inhabitants of the periphery abandoned the site soon after. This is an example of intensive warfare carried out by an enemy in order to completely eliminate a Maya state, rather than subjugate it. Research at Aguateca indicated that Classic period warriors were primarily members of the elite.|$|E
