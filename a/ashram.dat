5|$|In all {{versions}} of the tale, after marrying Gautama, Ahalya settles into his <b>ashram</b> (hermitage), which generally becomes the site of her epic curse. The Ramayana records that Gautama's <b>ashram</b> is in a forest (Mithila-upavana) near Mithila, where the couple practices asceticism together for several years. In other scriptures, the <b>ashram</b> is usually near the river bank. The Brahma Purana {{says that it is}} near the river Godavari and the Skanda Purana (701–1200 CE) places it near the river Narmada. The Padma Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana (801–1100 CE) describe the <b>ashram</b> as near the holy city of Pushkar.|$|E

5|$|Aurobindo's close spiritual collaborator, Mirra Richard (b. Alfassa), came to {{be known}} as The Mother. She was a French national, born in Paris on 21 February 1878. In her 20s she studied occultism with Max Theon. Along with her husband, Paul Richard, she went to Pondicherry on 29 March 1914, and finally settled there in 1920. Aurobindo {{considered}} her his spiritual equal and collaborator. After 24 November 1926, when Aurobindo retired into seclusion, he left it to her to plan, build and run the <b>ashram,</b> the community of disciples which had gathered around them. Some time later, when families with children joined the <b>ashram,</b> she established and supervised the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education with its experiments in the field of education. When he died in 1950, She continued their spiritual work, directed the <b>ashram,</b> and guided their disciples.|$|E

A preliminary site visit was made by George Nakashima and the schematic design was completed in 1936. Although Raymond had envisioned that the dormitory would be completed in six months, Sri Aurobindo was concerned that the noise of construction would disturb the <b>ashram,</b> so he decided that the building would be constructed by its residents.|$|E

5|$|The Indian {{independence}} movement developed {{roots in the}} city when Mahatma Gandhi established two ashrams– the Kochrab <b>Ashram</b> near Paldi in 1915 and the Satyagraha <b>Ashram</b> (now Sabarmati <b>Ashram)</b> {{on the banks of}} the Sabarmati in 1917– which would become centres of nationalist activities. During the mass protests against the Rowlatt Act in 1919, textile workers burned down 51 government buildings across the city in protest at a British attempt to extend wartime regulations after the First World War. In the 1920s, textile workers and teachers went on strike, demanding civil rights and better pay and working conditions. In 1930, Gandhi initiated the Salt Satyagraha from Ahmedabad by embarking from his <b>ashram</b> on the Dandi Salt March. The city's administration and economic institutions were rendered inoperative in the early 1930s by the large numbers of people who took to the streets in peaceful protests, and again in 1942 during the Quit India Movement. Following independence and the partition of India in 1947, the city was scarred by the intense communal violence that broke out between Hindus and Muslims in 1947, Ahmedabad was the focus for settlement by Hindu migrants from Pakistan, who expanded the city's population and transformed its demographics and economy.|$|E

When Uttanka narrated his experience in procuring the earrings, the guru and his wife blessed him. Veda then explained to Uttanka the significance of the sights he had seen in Nagaloka. The two women engaged in weaving were Dhata and Vidhata; they were creating the world and all its creatures. The threads were day and night. The wheel with twelve spokes was the year with 360 days. The six boys were the seasons. The giant and bullock were Indra and his elephant Airavata. Its dung was amrita (elixir of life), which kept Uttanka alive in Nagaloka. The rider and horse in Nagaloka were Indra and the fire-god Agni. Veda also explained to Uttanka that his friend, Indra, had helped him during his journey.|$|E
