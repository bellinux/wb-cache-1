40|$|Abstract. A new {{approach}} for the precise grinding of crankshaft pin is presented. In which, noncircular following strategy is investigated {{based on the}} motion model consists of horizontal feeding <b>axis,</b> additional <b>lifting</b> <b>axis</b> for wheel frame, and the active rotary axis for workpiece. The straight line relationship of wheel center, pin center and grinding point is ensured by the synchronism between standard arc interpolation motion of wheel frame and eccentric circular motion of pin section. Comparing with traditional tangential point tracing scheme, both constant grinding line-speed and simple control algorithm are fulfilled simultaneously. The negative effect of perpendicular deviation introduced by <b>lifting</b> <b>axis</b> is kinematically analyzed {{as well as the}} dynamic response error of servo system, and solving methods are carried out accordingly. By computer simulation and experimental test, the reported noncircular following strategy emerges good characteristics in the manufacturing of crankshaft, such as a strong adaptability for wheel wearing, simple motion control and high roundness precision...|$|R
40|$|Let L be a link in an {{thickened}} annulus. We {{specify the}} embedding of this annulus {{in the three}} sphere, and consider its complement {{thought of as the}} axis to L. In the right circumstances this <b>axis</b> <b>lifts</b> to a null-homologous knot in the double branched cover of the three sphere, branched over the embedded copy of L. This paper shows that the knot Floer homology of this lift, with mod 2 coefficients, can be computed from a spectral sequence starting at a type of Khovanov homology already described by Asaeda, Przytycki, and Sikora. We extend the known results about this type of Khovanov homology, and use it to provide a very simple explanation of the case when L is alternating for the obvious projection.

50|$|Having two coaxial sets of rotors {{provides}} {{symmetry of}} forces around the central <b>axis</b> for <b>lifting</b> {{the vehicle and}} laterally when flying in any direction. Because of the mechanical complexity, many helicopter designs use alternate configurations to avoid problems that arise when only one rotor is used. Common alternatives are single-rotor helicopters or tandem rotor arrangements.|$|R
50|$|Longitudinal {{dihedral}} is {{a comparatively}} obscure term {{related to the}} pitch axis of an airplane. It is the angle between the zero <b>lift</b> <b>axis</b> of the wing and horizontal tail. Longitudinal dihedral can influence the nature of controllability about the pitch axis {{and the nature of}} an aircraft's phugoid-mode oscillation.|$|R
50|$|Longitudinal {{dihedral}} {{can also}} mean the angle between the zero <b>lift</b> <b>axis</b> {{of the wing}} and tail instead of between the root chords of the two surfaces. This is the more meaningful usage because the directions of zero-lift are pertinent to longitudinal trim and stability while the directions of the root chords are not.|$|R

40|$|A {{monocoque}} {{box beam}} {{consisting of a}} 24 S-T aluminum-alloy sheet reinforced by four bulkheads and by longitudinal stringers and corner posts was subjected to bending loads as follows: pure bending about the <b>lift</b> <b>axis,</b> cantilever bending about the <b>lift</b> <b>axis,</b> and pure bending about both <b>lift</b> and drag <b>axis.</b> Longitudinal strains were measured for loads up to a load at which permanent set became measurable. The loads were sufficient to produce buckling of the sheet between stringers on the compression side of the box. The only noticeable effect of this buckling was a small increase in extreme-fiber strain on the compression side. The measured strains and measured deflections differed less than 10 percent from those computed from the simple beam theory after taking account of the effective width of the buckled sheet. The effect of the bulkheads {{on the distribution of}} stringer strain was negligible...|$|R
50|$|On the Unkapanı side, a 120 m swing bridge, {{essentially}} a cantilever structure, {{is to allow}} passage for large ships. It has 50 m and 70 m spans, which rest on a central pier. Controlled from a room on a platform between the bridge and the shoreline, the swing bridge turns in right angle about the vertical <b>axis</b> after <b>lifting,</b> and provides about 40 m free clearance within four to six minutes. It is planned that the swing bridge will be open once a week between {{the early hours of}} 1:00 and 5:00 in the summer time, and twice a week during these hours in the winter months. The gray color of the bridge was determined after extensive photographic studies of the surroundings.|$|R

They concluded that was one possible explanation for why hitters felt Fujikawa's fastball appeared to [...] "rise" [...] as it approached the plate.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} of the aerodynamics models for the comprehensive analysis CAMRAD II are described, particularly the unsteady aerodynamic models and dynamic stall models, and the free wake geometry calculation. Three models for the unsteady aerodynamic loads in attached flow are implemented: from incompressible thin-airfoil theory, from ONERA EDLIN, and from Leishman-Beddoes. Five dynamic stall models are implemented: from Johnson, Boeing, Leishman-Beddoes, ONERA EDLIN, and ONERA BH. A key feature of the implementation of these models is revisions allowing the retention of airfoil tables for static loads in all cases. Results are presented for a two-dimensional airfoil, a three-dimensional wing, and rotors. Extensions of the CAMRAD II free wake method to include hover and ground effect are described, including hover performance correlation. Notation.

50|$|In aerodynamics, {{angle of}} attack {{specifies}} the angle between the chord line of the wing of a fixed-wing aircraft and the vector representing the relative motion between the aircraft and the atmosphere. Since a wing can have twist, a chord line of the whole wing may not be definable, so an alternate reference line is simply defined. Often, the chord line of {{the root of the}} wing is chosen as the reference line. Another choice is to use a horizontal line on the fuselage as the reference line (and also as the longitudinal axis). Some authors do not use an arbitrary chord line, but use the zero <b>lift</b> <b>axis,</b> whereby zero {{angle of attack}} corresponds to zero coefficient of lift by definition.|$|R
40|$|The atomistic {{understanding}} of the dissociation mechanisms for large molecules adsorbed on surfaces is still a challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. This {{is especially true for}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which represent an important class of organic compounds used to produce novel graphene-based architectures. Here, we show that coronene molecules adsorbed on Ir(111) undergo major conformational changes during dissociation. They first tilt upward with respect to the surface, still keeping their planar configuration, and subsequently experience a rotation, which changes the molecular <b>axis</b> orientation. Upon <b>lifting,</b> the internal C–C strain is initially relieved; as the dehydrogenation proceeds, the molecules experience a progressive increase in the average interatomic distance and gradually settle to form dome-shaped nanographene flakes. Our results provide important insight into the complex mechanism of molecular breakup, which could have implications in the synthesis of new carbon-based nanostructured materials...|$|R
40|$|Planning {{of object}} {{manipulations}} {{is dependent on}} the ability to generate, store, and retrieve sensorimotor memories of previous actions associated with grasped objects. However, the sensorimotor memory representations linking object properties to the planning of grasp are not well understood. Here we use an object rotation task to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the nature of these sensorimotor memories. We asked subjects to grasp a grip device with an asymmetrical center of mass (CM) anywhere on its vertical surfaces and lift it while minimizing object roll. After subjects learned to minimize object roll by generating a compensatory moment, they were asked to rotate the object 180 ° about a vertical <b>axis</b> and <b>lift</b> it again. The rotation resulted in changing the direction of external moment opposite to that experienced during the prerotation block. Anticipatory grasp control was quantified by measuring the compensatory moment generated at object lift onset by thumb and index finger forces through their respective application points. On the first postrotation trial, subjects failed to generate a compensatory moment to counter the external moment caused by the new CM location, thus resulting in a large object roll. Nevertheless, after several object rotations subjects reduced object roll on the initial postrotation trials by anticipating the new CM location through the modulation of digit placement but not tangential forces. The differential improvement in modulating these two variables supports the notion of independent memory representations of kinematics and kinetics and is discussed in relation to neural mechanisms underlying visuomotor transformations...|$|R
30|$|To {{rotate the}} object about the Z axis we use two fingers which are pivoted about their midpoint. If the two fingers are moved in parallel, their motion is {{interpreted}} as a single touch point which induces the same rotation as XY rotate. This feature allows minor corrective adjustments to the X and Y axes while rotating about the Z <b>axis</b> without requiring <b>lifting</b> a finger from the screen or further mode changes. This mode will {{be referred to as}} Z+XY rotate. The Z+XY rotate mode is only possible because INSPECT is based on indirect touch. In direct touch systems the parallel motion of the two fingers is usually mapped to translation [31]. As such, a three axis integral rotation mode is, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, unique to our system. Users can also make fluid transitions between single finger and two finger rotations as desired. Z+XY rotate feels similar to rotating a physical trackball yet is different from Arcball+ by Rousset et al. [43]. Arcball+ uses the midpoint to rotate like the classical ARCBALL [13] algorithm. We avoided this approach because ARCBALL is known to affect the Z axis as well.|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of engine}} {{placement}} on flutter {{characteristics of a}} very flexible high-aspect-ratio wing are investigated using the code NATASHA (Nonlinear Aeroelastic Trim And Stability of HALE Aircraft). The analysis was validated against published results for divergence and flutter of swept wings and found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental results of the classical wing of Goland. Moreover, modal frequencies and damping obtained for the Goland wing were found in excellent agreement with published results based on a new continuum-based unsteady aerodynamic formulation. Gravity for this class of wings {{plays an important role}} in flutter characteristics. In the absence of aerodynamic and gravitational forces and without an engine, the kinetic energy of the first two modes are calculated. Maximum and minimum flutter speed locations coincide with the area of minimum and maximum kinetic energy of the second bending and torsion modes. Time-dependent dynamic behavior of a turboshaft engine (JetCat SP 5) is simulated with a transient engine model and the nonlinear aeroelastic response of the wing to the engine's time-dependent thrust and dynamic excitation is presented. Below the flutter speed, at the wing tip and behind the elastic axis, the impulse engine excitation leads to a stable limit cycle oscillation; and for the ramp kind of excitation, beyond the flutter speed, at 75 % span, behind the elastic axis, it produces chaotic oscillation of the wing. Both the excitations above the flutter speed are stabilized, on the inboard portion of the wing. Effects of engine placement and sweep on flutter characteristics of a backswept flying wing resembling the Horten IV are explored using NATASHA. This aircraft exhibits a non-oscillatory yawing instability, expected in aircraft with neither a vertical tail nor yaw control. More important, however, is the presence of a low frequency “body-freedom flutter” mode. The aircraft center of gravity was held fixed during the study, which allowed aircraft controls to trim similarly for each engine location, and minimized flutter speed variations along the inboard span. Maximum flutter speed occurred for engine placement just outboard of 60 % span with engine center of gravity forward of the elastic axis. The body-freedom flutter mode was largely unaffected by the engine placement except for cases in which the engine is placed at the wing tip and near the elastic axis. In the absence of engines, aerodynamics, and gravity, a region of minimum kinetic energy density for the first symmetric free-free bending mode is also near the 60 % span. A possible relationship between the favorable flutter characteristics obtained by placing the engines at that point and the region of minimum kinetic energy is briefly explored. Effects of multiple engine placement on a similar type of aircraft are studied. The results showed that multiple engine placement increases flutter speed particularly when the engines are placed in the outboard portion of the wing (60 % to 70 % span), forward of the elastic <b>axis,</b> while the <b>lift</b> to drag ratio is affected negligibly. The behavior of the sub- and supercritical eigenvalues is studied for two cases of engine placement. NATASHA captures a hump body-freedom flutter with low frequency for the clean wing case, which disappears as the engines are placed on the wings. In neither case is there any apparent coalescence between the unstable modes. NATASHA captures other non-oscillatory unstable roots with very small amplitude, apparently originating with flight dynamics. For the clean-wing case, in the absence of aerodynamic and gravitational forces, the regions of minimum kinetic energy density for the first and third bending modes are located around 60 % span. For the second mode, this kinetic energy density has local minima around the 20 % and 80 % span. The regions of minimum kinetic energy of these modes are in agreement with calculations that show a noticeable increase in flutter speed at these regions if engines are placed forward of the elastic axis. High Altitude, Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft can achieve sustained, uninterrupted flight time if they use solar power. Wing morphing of solar powered HALE aircraft can significantly increase solar energy absorbency. An example of the kind of morphing considered in this thesis requires the wings to fold so as to orient a solar panel to be hit more directly by the sun's rays at specific times of the day. In this study solar powered HALE flying wing aircraft are modeled with three beams with lockable hinge connections. Such aircraft are shown to be capable of morphing passively, following the sun by means of aerodynamic forces and engine thrusts. The analysis underlying NATASHA was extended to include the ability to simulate morphing of the aircraft into a “Z” configuration. Because of the “long endurance” feature of HALE aircraft, such morphing needs to be done without relying on actuators and at as near zero energy cost as possible. The emphasis of this study is to substantially demonstrate the processes required to passively morph a flying wing into a Z-shaped configuration and back again. Ph. D...|$|R
