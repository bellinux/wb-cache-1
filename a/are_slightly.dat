5|$|Clicks {{are quick}} {{broadband}} burst pulses, used for sonar, although some lower-frequency broadband vocalizations may serve a non-echolocative purpose such as communication; for example, the pulsed calls of belugas.

25|$|Haloalkanes are {{reactive}} towards nucleophiles. They are polar molecules: {{the carbon}} {{to which the}} halogen <b>is</b> attached <b>is</b> <b>slightly</b> electropositive where the halogen <b>is</b> <b>slightly</b> electronegative. This results in an electron deficient (electrophilic) carbon which, inevitably, attracts nucleophiles.|$|R
5|$|A less {{invasive}} {{approach is}} thoracoscopy, {{usually in the}} form of a procedure called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The results from VATS-based pleural abrasion <b>are</b> <b>slightly</b> worse than those achieved using thoracotomy in the short term, but produce smaller scars in the skin. Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS offers a shorter in-hospital stays, less need for postoperative pain control, and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery. VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves insufflation of talc, which activates an inflammatory reaction that causes the lung to adhere to the chest wall.|$|E
