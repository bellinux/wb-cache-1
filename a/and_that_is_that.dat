[...] Renoir's sentiment of objective humanism for the film's characters is articulated by Octave's remark and shows his empathy for the people he was simultaneously criticizing. Richard Roud praised Renoir's role in the film, observing that Renoir's honesty compelled him to include his own role in his social criticism: [...] "he {{did not wish to}} stand outside. And Renoir/Octave serves as the standard against which reality and fiction can be measured." [...] In his original outline for the film, Renoir said he intended all the characters to be sincere and that the film would have no villains.|$|E

[...] Hillary Clinton was not directly asked the same question, but was instead asked: [...] "What would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn't?" [...] Clinton had already met with Black Lives Matter representatives, and emphasized what she described as a more pragmatic approach to enacting change, stating [...] "Look, I don't believe you change hearts. I believe you change laws". Without policy change, she felt [...] "we'll be back here in 10 years having the same conversation."

500|$|While it {{eventually}} became a bestseller in the United States, The Red Badge of Courage was more popular and sold more rapidly in England when {{it was published in}} late 1895. Crane was delighted with his novel's success overseas, writing to a friend: [...] "I have only one pride <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the English edition of The Red Badge of Courage has been [...] with great praise by the English reviewers. I am proud of this simply because the remoter people would seem more just and harder to win." [...] Critic, veteran and Member of Parliament George Wyndham called the novel a [...] "masterpiece", applauding Crane's ability to [...] "stage the drama of man, so to speak, within the mind of one man, and then admits you as to a theatre." [...] Harold Frederic wrote in his own review that [...] "If there were in existence any books of a similar character, one could start confidently by saying that it was the best of its kind. But it has no fellows. It is a book outside of all classification. So unlike anything else is it that the temptation rises to deny that it is a book at all". Frederic, who would later befriend Crane when the latter relocated to England in 1897, juxtaposed the novel's treatment of war to those by Leo Tolstoy, Émile Zola and Victor Hugo, all of whose works he believed to be [...] "positively... cold and ineffectual" [...] when compared to The Red Badge of Courage.|$|E

[...] "But small boys tend to find their heroes where they can. One thing there <b>was</b> no doubt about, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Japanese <b>were</b> extremely brave.
