5|$|A {{circumstance}} {{occurred during}} the action which so strongly marks the invincible spirit of British seamen, when engaging the enemies of their country, that I cannot resist the pleasure I have in making it known to their Lordships; the Temeraire was boarded by accident; or design, by a French ship on one side, and a Spaniard on the other; the contest was vigorous, but, {{in the end the}} combined ensigns were torn from the poop and the British hoisted in their places. Collingwood's account, probably based largely on Harvey's report {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the battle, contained several errors. Temeraire had closely engaged two French ships, rather than a French and a Spanish ship, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been boarded by either during the action. Nevertheless, the account was popular and a print was rushed out purporting to show Harvey taking the lead in clearing Temeraires decks of enemy seamen.|$|E
5|$|A {{group that}} opposed the hippie {{movement}} {{managed to keep}} Guldy off the mayoral ballot in 1975.

After his election, Puusemp chided Guldy for being a poor role model for the village youth. Puusemp was not a native of Rosendale <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> lived there long. By early July 1975, Puusemp had appointed a village dog warden after a dog bit a child and was allowed to run about the streets unrestrained.|$|E

5|$|After Martin's death, the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry {{began to}} buckle as {{increasing}} numbers of North Korean troops flooded into Chonan from the Northwest and eastern roads. The battalion suffered heavy casualties, but was saved by the continuous fire laid down by the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion. Between 0800 and 1000, U.S. units began a disorganized retreat from the town, many soldiers deserting their units and running from the battle. Wadlington, now {{in command of the}} 34th Infantry, moved 3rd Battalion to a collecting point south of the town, where 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry was holding a blocking position <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been engaged.

After satisfying the authorities that he had actually been taken prisoner <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> surrendered voluntarily, he returned to his depot at Kimberley.

40|$|This essay explores Hemingway’s {{depiction}} {{of women in}} the novel To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Not.</b> In To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Not,</b> the novel explored in this essay, traits of Hemingway’s renowned sexist {{depiction of}} women <b>have</b> been investigated, <b>and</b> the purpose of the essay was to illuminate that the women of To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Not</b> are reduced to roles which resembles Simone de Beauvoir’s observations, namely the perception of women as the Other, assuming subordinate roles. In order to achieve this task, a close reading has been done on Hemingway’s novel To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Not,</b> <b>and</b> his portrayal of five female characters in the novel has been analyzed. Simone de Beauvoir’s theory has been applied for an understanding of these female characters in order to see if these women were portrayed in a manner resembling de Beauvoir notions, that is, marked by patriarchal perspectives. The conclusion drawn in this essay is that all the women in the novel are portrayed as "absolute sex", subordinated to men. Thus, the depictions {{of the women in the}} novel To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Not</b> were found to correspond to patriarchal gender roles as described by Simone de Beauvoir...|$|R

5|$|After the battle, the {{captured}} German panzerarmee general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery {{that he had}} believed the allies {{had at least one}} more armoured division than they did, and that the attack would be in the south. Rommel's stand-in, general Georg Stumme, thought the attack would not begin for several weeks. German documents and prisoners of war confirmed that the German commanders had believed in the existence of the decoy unit, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> anticipated the true avenue of attack.

As the Byzantine–Turkish force advanced towards the defenders, Momchil led his troops ahead into battle. His cavalry was promptly eliminated by Turkish sharpshooters and his remaining troops were surrounded on three sides by heavily armed horsemen. Momchil's remaining men continued the fight on foot and for the most part did not surrender until Momchil himself perished.|$|E
