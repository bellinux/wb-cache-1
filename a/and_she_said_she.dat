25|$|In 2000, the Department of Justice {{completed}} their own investigation into Jowers' claims; {{it did not}} find {{evidence to support the}} allegations about conspiracy. The investigation report recommends no further investigation unless some new reliable facts are presented. A sister of Jowers admitted that he had fabricated the story so he could make $300,000 from selling the story, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> had corroborated his story in order to get some money to pay her income tax. King biographer David Garrow disagrees with William F. Pepper's claims that the government killed King. He is supported by author Gerald Posner.|$|E
25|$|Poirot is {{diverted}} {{to stay in}} an English village inn when his chauffeur-driven car breaks down. Although he doesn't appreciate the badly cooked meal he is served, he does enjoy relaxing {{in front of the}} fire in his room after his walk through the snow to reach the establishment. He is interrupted by the mechanic who is trying to repair the car. The young man – Ted Williamson – is impossibly handsome and well-built, like a Greek god, and Poirot is reminded of a shepherd in Arcady. Williamson knows of Poirot's reputation and asks him to trace a young girl who has disappeared. The previous June, Williamson was called out to a large house nearby called 'Grasslawn' to repair a broken radio. The house owners and their guests were out boating and he was shown in by the maid to a Russian ballet dancer who was staying there. The golden-haired maid was called Nita and Williamson fell for her. He went out for a walk with her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> would be back with her mistress in two weeks time and would see him again but when the time had come for their second meeting, the maid was different. The new maid, Marie Hellin, gave him an address in North London to write to contact Nita – but his letter came back unanswered. Poirot visits this address and was told the girl, an Italian, had returned to her home country. She is described by the landlady as dark-haired and bad-tempered, whereas the girl Williamson described was golden-haired. Poirot tries to trace Nita through her former employer, Katrina Samoushenka, but is told that the dancer has gone to Switzerland. He also speaks with the owner of 'Grasslawn', Sir George Sanderfield, who remembers Marie – with some unease – but doesn't recall a maid on the first occasion of Madame Samoushenka's visit to his house, and thinks Poirot is mistaken. Marie is the subject of Poirot's next visit. She was employed in the last week of June when the previous maid had left, possibly due to illness. She hints that she knows something of Sir George that Poirot would like to know, but the detective doesn't take up the offer, much to her annoyance.|$|E

I spoke to the interim Prime Minister [...] <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was under fire" [...] and added {{that the international community}} should have an [...] "energetic reaction" [...] to the coup. Pires also dismissed claims that Indjai was arrested suggesting that he was, in fact, a part of it (he was also involved in the 2010 military unrest before being appointed chief-of-staff).|$|E

Anderson was a long-time fan of Home and Away <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was [...] "thrilled" [...] when she won the role of Charlie after an audition. Four days after hearing that she had landed the part, Anderson had to move to Sydney from Melbourne for filming. Anderson has said that her job as a model should not reflect on her acting ability. She added [...] "For me, modelling was just an avenue that got me into acting, I have always wanted to act". She also stated that the role is her dream job.|$|E

[...] She also added: [...] "I loved seeing Cristina {{at least try}} to stand by her man." [...] Of Yang and Owen's wedding, Armstrong said: [...] "Glad we made a clean disposal of the Teddy-Owen-Cristina love triangle, though, when he quipped to Teddy, [...] "I heard there's a guy," [...] <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was happy for him." [...] She also praised Owen's proposal scene, giving it an [...] "A". Later, she praised their marriage, saying: [...] "I am absolutely loving the stronger-than-ever lady-bond between these two this season. Is it because they're both married now? Just growing up? Whatever, it's the opposite of Blair and Serena's annoyingly fickle frenemy status on Gossip Girl, and I can’t get enough." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Home and Away {{producers}} {{introduced a}} storyline that saw Charlie begin {{a relationship with}} another woman. Producers hoped the plot would boost the shows ratings. Over five weeks, the storyline would see Charlie realise that her friendship with Joey Collins (played by Kate Bell) is beginning to develop into something else. As they fall for each other, Charlie and Joey share intimate kissing and dance scenes. Anderson explained that the producers came to her about the storyline {{and asked if she}} was okay with it, as it was to be emotional and it required commitment. Anderson told them that she was okay with it <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> was pleased to be given the storyline as it showed more of Charlie's vulnerable side. This was Anderson's first big storyline in the show and she was required to work more hours. Anderson explained that she and Bell formed a trust early on, which helped them to portray the story in the right light. Anderson spoke with gay friends, so she could form an accurate portrayal of her character's feelings. The storyline [...] "throws [...] world upside down" [...] and changes her whole identity; it surprises her.|$|E

500|$|Rainie's {{relationship}} with Phil Mitchell (McFadden) was first explored during her stint in 2010. Rainie and Phil {{were to be}} involved in a storyline involving the taking of crack cocaine. Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, [...] "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers her something that she wants, and that is a place to be, while she has something that he wants, and that's drugs—so it's a match at that time." [...] Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, [...] "If {{there are people who have}} a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions. I think it can be hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this." [...] She also stated that if EastEnders [...] "has saved one life by putting this story out it's been worth it. The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life. Some of it is going to be light entertainment, some isn't." ...|$|E

Her technique and musicianship have been much praised. Conductor Thomas Schippers said in a 1971 interview with Time that she had [...] "the fastest voice alive." [...] The New York Times writes that [...] "she could dispatch coloratura roulades and embellishments, capped with radiant high Ds and E-flats, with seemingly effortless agility. She sang with scrupulous musicianship, rhythmic incisiveness and a vivid sense of text." [...] Soprano Leontyne Price was [...] "flabbergasted at how many millions of things she can do with a written scale." [...] Her vocal range, in performance, extended from F3 to F6, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> could sometimes hit a G6 in warm up.|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{began working}} {{in the studio with}} Naughty Boy in 2009, where the pair first worked {{together}} on Chipmunk's debut album I Am Chipmunk. When Sandé was 16 years of age, her parents took her to Alicia Keys Songs in A Minor Tour <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> always wanted Keys to hear her music. She spoke on why she likes Keys so much; [...] "I'd read about her background and identified with her on so many levels. She was mixed race like me, a great student who'd been top of her class, who played piano and loved Nina Simone. And there she was in the pop charts, yet with songs that had a message. I saw 16,000 people hanging on her every word and thought, [...] "I want this kind of attention. I want Alicia to know my music." [...] The pair met when Sandé had just came back from New York and just began a second songwriting stint, but this time involved with Keys. The pair sat at a piano and played for hours {{trying to come up with}} a good track. She said that she wanted the songs on her debut album to be fresh and she wanted to try and take it back how she wrote songs at the beginning of her career. Sandé had classical music training as a songwriter in her teens and learnt to play the piano at an early age, and getting across that she played, made and wrote her own music was very important to her. She said on the album, she wanted people to see every side of her as an artist, so it was important to have songs there where there could be a real connection with the lyric, rather than there just be throwaway pop music. Joni Mitchell and Lauryn Hill were also major influences for the album.|$|E
