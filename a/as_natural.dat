5|$|Many {{other species}} have become {{naturalized}} outside the Americas {{after having been}} introduced by people, especially in Australia, Hawaii, and the Mediterranean region.

They rapidly became a major weed problem, but are now controlled by biological agents, particularly the moth Cactoblastis cactorum. The weed potential of Opuntia species in Australia continues however, leading to all opuntioid cacti except O. ficus-indica being declared Weeds of National Significance by the Australian Weeds Committee in April 2012.|$|E
