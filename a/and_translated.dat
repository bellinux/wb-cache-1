The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to find correlation between (1) grammatical competence <b>and</b> <b>translating</b> skill; (2) vocabulary mastery <b>and</b> <b>translating</b> skill; <b>and</b> (3) grammatical competence and vocabulary mastery simultaneously <b>and</b> <b>translating</b> skill. This research used correlational method. The study {{was carried out in}} May 2014 at SMA N 1 Wonosari. The population was all the second grade in the 2013 / 2014 academic year which consisted of eight classes with 320 students in total. The sample was 36 students in a single class. The sample was chosen with cluster random sampling technique. The instrument in collecting data was test. The test was used to collect data of students’ grammatical competence, vocabulary mastery, <b>and</b> <b>translating</b> skill. Simple Correlation and Multiple Regression Correlation was used to analyze the data. The result of data analysis shows that in the level of significance α = 0. 05 (1) there is positive correlation between grammatical competence <b>and</b> <b>translating</b> skill (rx 1 y) = 0. 54 > rt 0. 329); (2) there is positive correlation between vocabulary mastery <b>and</b> <b>translating</b> skill (rx 1 y) = 0. 407 > rt 0. 329); (3) there is a positive correlation between grammatical competence, vocabulary mastery, <b>and</b> <b>translating</b> skill. (rx 12 y) = 0. 629 > rt 0. 329. The grammatical competence and vocabulary mastery simultaneously is significantly influences the translating skill (Fo = 10. 82 > Ft 3. 32). Based on the result of the study, it is found that there is a positive correlation between grammatical competence <b>and</b> <b>translating</b> skill. There is a positive correlation between vocabulary mastery <b>and</b> <b>translating</b> skill. There is a positive correlation between grammatical competence and vocabulary mastery simultaneously <b>and</b> <b>translating</b> skill of the eleventh grade students of SMA N 1 Wonosari in the 2013 / 2014 academic year.

He taught natural history at the Collegium Carolinum in the Ottoneum, Kassel (1778–84), and later at the Academy of Vilna (Vilnius University) (1784–87). In 1788, he became head librarian at the University of Mainz.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationships between transcription, high-level writing processes, and writing performance in Grades 7 – 8 (N = 196). Structural equation modeling {{was used to test}} the direct effects of handwriting fluency and spelling accuracy on planning <b>and</b> <b>translating,</b> <b>and</b> of these latter on writing performance, as well as the indirect effects of handwriting fluency and spelling accuracy on writing performance, via planning <b>and</b> <b>translating.</b> Results showed that the proposed model fitted the data extremely well, explaining 46 % of the variability in writing performance. We found that higher handwriting fluency was associated with better planning skills, higher spelling accuracy was associated with better <b>translating</b> skills, <b>and</b> better planning <b>and</b> <b>translating</b> skills were associated with greater writing performance. We found indirect effects of handwriting fluency and spelling accuracy on writing performance, respectively, via planning <b>and</b> <b>translating.</b> These results suggest that transcription continues to impact on writing during teenage school years, by constraining high-level writing processes...|$|R

They put Neill in a lineage of experimental thought, but questioned his lasting contribution to psychology.
