500|$|For the exteriors of {{the capital}} city of King's Landing, that had been doubled for Malta for the entire season 1, now the {{production}} flew to the Croatian city of Dubrovnik. Known as The Pearl of the Adriatic, the city proved to be a good representation of King's Landing since it shared many characteristics with the fictional capital: it had a well-preserved medieval look, with high walls and the sea at its side. According to David Benioff, executive producer of the show, [...] "The minute we started walking around the city walls we knew that was it. You read the descriptions in the book <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> to Dubrovnik and that's what the actual city is. It has the sparkling sea, sun and beautiful architecture." ...|$|E
500|$|Flight {{attendant}} CeeCee Lyles {{called her}} husband at 09:47:57 and left him a message saying the plane had been hijacked. Marion Britton called her friend, Fred Fiumano, at 09:49:12. Fiumano recalled, [...] "she said, 'We're gonna. They're gonna kill us, you know, We're gonna die.' And I told her, 'Don't worry, they hijacked the plane, they're gonna take you for a ride, you go to their country, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> back. You stay there for vacation.' You don't know what to say—what are you gonna say? I kept on saying the same things, 'Be calm.' And she was crying and—you know—more or less crying and screaming and yelling." [...] Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called {{her husband at}} 09:50:04 and {{told him she was}} preparing scalding water to throw at the hijackers. Passenger Lauren Grandcolas called her husband twice, once before takeoff and once during the hijacking. He missed both of her calls. She then passed her phone to Honor Elizabeth Wainio. Wainio called her stepmother at 09:53:43 and concluded, four and a half minutes later, by saying, [...] "I have to go. They're breaking into the cockpit. I love you." [...] Jarrah dialed in the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) frequency for the VOR navigational aid at Reagan National Airport at 09:55:11 to direct the plane toward Washington, D.C. Bradshaw, on the phone with her husband, said [...] "Everyone is running up to first class. I've got to go. Bye." [...] Beamer told Jefferson that the group was planning to [...] "jump on" [...] the hijackers and fly the plane into the ground before the hijackers' plan could be followed through. Beamer recited the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm with Jefferson, prompting others to join in. Beamer requested of Jefferson, [...] "If I don't make it, please call my family and let them know how much I love them." [...] After this, Jefferson heard muffled voices and Beamer clearly answering, [...] "Are you ready? Okay. Let's roll." [...] These were Beamer's last words to Jefferson.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing {{the album}} song for song, Xsnoize.com's Sandra Blemster {{compared}} Hayley Mary to Kate Bush and Chrissie Hynde. She wrote: [...] "On listening to Synthia I feel like I’ve {{paid a visit}} to the cinema and watched a gripping, extraordinary film. You know when a film captures you that much <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> out, it’s daylight and your eyes hurt from the sun? That’s how this album felt. Intoxicating stuff: maybe it’s a full moon." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2014 interview, Rickles {{dismissed}} {{thoughts of}} retiring, saying: [...] "I'm in good health. I'm working better than I ever have. The audiences are great. Why should I retire? I'm like a fighter. The bell rings <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> out and fight. My energy comes alive. And I still enjoy it." [...] Until {{his death in}} 2017, despite being impeded by multiple surgeries following a bout with necrotizing fasciitis in 2013, Rickles continued touring across the United States.|$|E
2500|$|After Pettyfer {{completed}} filming Stormbreaker, he did {{not discuss}} the film with anyone at his school, citing {{the advice of his}} Stormbreaker star Ewan McGregor, who told him to keep his personal and professional lives separate. Pettyfer subsequently decided to leave school and concentrate on his film career, while studying drama at college, saying that [...] "When you have already experienced going out and working in the real world, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> back to school, you just see it as a playground and you don't want to be there any more".|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} R.E.M.'s previous two records, the music of Monster consisted of distorted guitar tones, minimal overdubs, and touches of 1970s glam rock. Peter Buck described Monster as [...] "a 'rock' record, with the rock in quotation marks." [...] He explained, [...] "That's not what we started out to make, but that's certainly how it turned out to be. There's a nudge, nudge, wink, wink feel to the whole record. Like, it's a rock record, but is it really?" [...] Mike Mills told Time, [...] "On past albums we had been exploring acoustic instruments, trying to use the piano and mandolin, and we did it about all we wanted to do it. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> back to the fact that playing loud electric-guitar music is about as fun as music can be." [...] Stipe's vocals were pushed back in the mix. Buck's guitar work on the album was inspired by the tremolo-heavy guitar playing of Glen Johansson from Echobelly, who supported R.E.M. for some of the Monster Tour.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for Lopez told People magazine that Lopez was not replacing Paula Abdul on the eighth season of American Idol because she would be busy promoting her film, The Back-up Plan {{as well as her}} new album. Both projects were slated for a January 2010 release, despite Lopez previously stating that she was aiming for the end of 2009. However during an interview with KTU Mornings, Lopez revealed that both the album and film were being pushed back to April 2010. Rap-Up magazine would later confirm that the album and film were being released together in cross-promotion of each other. However this date appeared unlikely when, backstage at the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, she said [...] "I'm working on my album that will be out... hopefully this year, we'll see if I get it done... You know how it is, you go in your there non-stop, you leave it alone for a minute <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> back– you're like, okay, this is what I need." ...|$|E
