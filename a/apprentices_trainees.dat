40|$|In this research, {{skills for}} {{sustainability}} are broadly conceived as including skills for social, {{economic and environmental}} sustainability – a triple bottom-line approach. Since 2009 Australian governments have been implementing an agreement that embeds skills for sustainability into vocational education and training, despite scant information about the actual levels of demand for, and supply of these skills. This study provides evidence on the actual depth and breadth of the take-up of these skills within Australian training organisations and workplaces. The demand studied in this research is that expressed by the primary consumers of Australian Vocational Education and Training (VET) services, students who engage in VET studies, this is known in the literature as social demand for education. VET students and teachers responded to two survey instruments that explored the sustainability values, behaviours, learning and teaching of Australian <b>apprentices,</b> <b>trainees</b> and their teachers. The {{results of this study}} show ‘a social demand’ for skills for sustainability. In summary, the results show that: 	<b>Apprentices,</b> <b>trainees</b> and their teachers cared a great deal about social, economic and environmental sustainability; 	Supply was closely aligned to social demand for skills for sustainability so that demand for skills for sustainability from VET students was almost entirely met; 	There are important differences in the teaching, learning and utilisation of skills for sustainability that are related to gender and age; and 	In-class learning of environmental skills has increased over time and now slightly outweighs learning of these skills at work, however community learning of these skills outweighs both. The findings suggest that: 	Further action is required to embed green skills into the VET system, especially in the areas of energy efficiency and supply chains; 	The VET system {{plays an important role in}} supporting community cohesion and economic literacy, especially for women; 	It is important that social sustainability is properly considered in analysis informing VET policy; and 	Gender differences in values and behaviours and gender and age differences in learning skills for sustainability have important implications for the design of future skills for sustainability programs. VET students and their teachers have unique insights into the supply of and demand for skills for sustainability, and this viewpoint can contribute, now and in the future, to the further development of skills for sustainability in Australia...|$|E

In order to provide all Austrian employees regardless of their place of residence as well as actual opening hours of libraries access to fiction as well as non-fiction books, the Chamber of Labor (AK) has established a virtual branch of its existing public libraries on 23 March 2011. The AK digital library is set up as an internet-based library, which is operated jointly by seven Länder branches of the Austrian Chamber of Labor. When finally set up, the AK digital library will represent the first bond of public libraries accessible throughout Austria.

This article discusses the factors contributing to non- completion among <b>apprentices</b> and <b>trainees</b> in regional Victoria, and how the experiences of those <b>apprentices</b> and <b>trainees</b> who did not complete their training compare to those currently in-training. Research focused on the four industry sectors of construction, engineering, hospitality and retail. These were chosen as representative of both apprentice experiences (construction and engineering) and trainee experiences (hospitality and retail) and all four industries are well represented in training figures for the region. Of the 105 interviewed, 71 or 67. 6 percent were apprentices and 34 or 33. 3 percent were trainees. Among those interviewed, 39 were non-completers, 26 were still in-training but voiced some significant issues and were identified as &# 039;at-risk&# 039; of withdrawing, 32 were also in-training but likely to complete (though within this group there was also quite a degree of dissatisfaction), and eight had recently completed their training.

40|$|Training and {{education}} are acknowledged routes into employment, {{but they also}} entail risks of contemporaneous financial loss, and economic and social insecurity. This paper explores the specific risk of homelessness among <b>apprentices</b> and <b>trainees,</b> drawing on a survey conducted in South Australia in 2013. Housing has been largely overlooked by studies of the wellbeing of <b>apprentices</b> and <b>trainees,</b> and by explorations of the drivers of attrition rates that continue to plague Australia’s training schemes. The data examined here reveal the high proportion of income that trainees spent on their housing; home moves motivated {{by the desire to}} reduce rental or mortgage payments; and a small proportion of learners who experienced periods of homelessness. Closer statistical analysis reveals that <b>apprentices</b> and <b>trainees</b> with past experiences of homelessness were disproportionately likely to be pursuing courses in retail and personal services, or in transport. They were also likely to be receiving Youth Allowance or AUSTUDY payments. We recommend better recording of apprentices’ and trainees’ housing situations and greater use of administrative data to improve our understanding and reduce the incidence of homelessness among this population.

Walt was impressed by Thomas's work and how he romanticized the scene and kept the scene in.

40|$|The award {{modernisation}} {{process is}} {{drawing to a}} close {{at the same time the}} Federal Government declares it is ‘training for the recovery’. Research into training outcomes has consistently shown that job-related factors, such as remuneration and restrictions on unreasonable hours are linked to completion rates among <b>apprentices</b> and <b>trainees.</b> Likewise, workers cite a lack of financial support and access to time off as factors inhibiting them from participating in training. An analysis of a cross-section of relevant modern awards reveals that most modern awards provide at least some employment conditions for <b>apprentices</b> and <b>trainees</b> likely to improve training outcomes. However, modern awards do much less to promote workers’ involvement in further training.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an amalgamation of three sequential research projects conducted by EDGE Employment Solutions {{over the past}} decade. The first project, commenced in 1999, was a local initiative {{to increase the number}} of <b>apprentices</b> and <b>trainees</b> with disability being supported by EDGE. The completion rate for participants in this project was equivalent to that of people without disability undertaking apprenticeships and traineeships in Australia. However, it was found that Group Training Organisations, who hire <b>apprentices</b> and <b>trainees</b> to then place them with different employers, did not have the necessary skills or resources to place and support people with disability. To fill this gap, the second research project, undertaken in 2002, surveyed all 180 Group Training Organisations operating in Australia. This was followed by a site visit of six GTOs who were most successful in their disability efforts, to discern best practice in placing and supporting <b>apprentices</b> and <b>trainees</b> with disability. The third research project, which built on the findings of the previous two projects, was initiated in 2003 and enlisted 20 Group Training Organisations and 20 Disability Employment Services from around Australia to form partnerships to capitalise on their complementary expertise and resources. Apprenticeship and traineeship completion rates for participants in the third project surpassed those for people without disability in Australia.

50|$|The {{distinction}} between the terms <b>apprentices</b> and <b>trainees</b> lies mainly around traditional trades and {{the time it takes}} to gain a qualification. The Australian government uses Australian Apprenticeships Centres to administer and facilitate Australian Apprenticeships so that funding can be disseminated to eligible businesses and <b>apprentices</b> and <b>trainees</b> and to support the whole process as it underpins the future skills of Australian industry. Australia also has a fairly unusual safety net in place for businesses and Australian Apprentices with its Group Training scheme. This is where businesses that are not able to employ the Australian Apprentice for the full period until they qualify, are able to lease or hire the Australian Apprentice from a Group Training Organisation. It is a safety net, because the Group Training Organisation is the employer and provides continuity of employment and training for the Australian Apprentice.|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the debate {{surrounding}} quality of training as it has unfolded in Australia and how concerns about high non-completion rates have entered the debate. Design/methodology/approach - This paper bases its discussion of quality in VET training on analysis of qualitative data collected from focus groups and one-on-one interviews conducted with employers, Institutes of Tertiary and Further Education, registered training organisations, trade unions and local, State and Commonwealth government representatives located in the southeastern part of Victoria, Australia. Findings - The paper shows that throughout many parts of the world a growing concern has emerged about the quality of training for <b>apprentices</b> and <b>trainees</b> in what has become an increasingly deregulated environment dominated by private interests. In Australia, where non-completion rates can be as high as 50 percent of those who commence training, government leaders at both State and Federal levels are taking a renewed interested in understanding the relationship between quality of training and non-completion rates. The paper finds that data suggesting training quality in Australia is being threatened by fully on-the-job training, the narrowing of training skills, the loss of transferable skills and a lack of training. It argues that these factors have contributed to high rates of non-completions among <b>apprentices</b> and <b>trainees</b> and that poor regulation of quality standards, government subsidies to employers and training organisations and abuse are contributing to these quality problems. Originality/value - The paper presents useful insights into the relationship between quality in training and attrition among <b>apprentices</b> and <b>trainees</b> in regional Australia...|$|R
