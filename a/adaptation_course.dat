40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} {{concentrated on the}} topic of adaptation courses for the pupils of secondary vocational schools. In the theoretical part, the term <b>adaptation</b> <b>course</b> together with its inclusion into experiential learning is defined. Available theoretical findings about adaptation courses are synthesized. Attention is also given to the issue of social relations and roles in a school class and the options of interaction using the adaptation courses. The methods used for processing the theoretical part are the study of literary sources, using the created notes and the synthesis. The practical part is consisted of two parts. The first part is creating own design of an <b>adaptation</b> <b>course</b> for the pupils of {{the first year of the}} secondary vocational schools, creating appropriate methodology for teachers [...] implementers of the adaptation courses and realization of the designed <b>adaptation</b> <b>course.</b> The aim of the second part is evaluation of the <b>adaptation</b> <b>course</b> by means of a questionnaire given to pupils who attended the <b>adaptation</b> <b>course.</b> In the questionnaire, total evaluation of the <b>adaptation</b> <b>course</b> is investigated from the pupils' point of view...|$|E

40|$|Callous-unemotional (CU) traits have mainly {{been studied}} in {{relation}} to conduct disorder (CD), but can also occur in other disorder groups. However, {{it is unclear whether}} there is a clinically relevant cut-off value of levels of CU traits in predicting reduced quality of life (QoL) and clinical symptoms, and whether CU traits better fit a categorical (taxonic) or dimensional model. Parents of 979 youths referred to a child and adolescent psychiatric clinic rated their child's CU traits on the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional traits (ICU), QoL on the Kidscreen- 27, and clinical symptoms on the Child Behavior Checklist. Experienced clinicians conferred DSM-IV-TR diagnoses of ADHD, ASD, anxiety/mood disorders and DBD-NOS/ODD. The ICU was also used to score the DSM- 5 specifier 'with limited prosocial emotions' (LPE) of Conduct Disorder. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses revealed that the predictive accuracy of the ICU and LPE regarding QoL and clinical symptoms was poor to fair, and similar across diagnoses. A clinical cut-off point could not be defined. Taxometric analyses suggested that callous-unemotional traits on the ICU best reflect a dimension rather than taxon. More research is needed on the impact of CU traits on the functional <b>adaptation,</b> <b>course,</b> and response to treatment of non-CD conditions...|$|E

The aim {{of this study is to}} design the most appropriate adaptation activity based on research carried out. Adolescence, its individual periods, physical and psychological changes an adolescent goes through, are described in the first, theoretical part. The transition from primary school to secondary school is challenging for pupils because of many reasons and is linked with varying degrees of stress. Aspects of successful adaptation and individual adaptation activities suitable for children are described in the thesis.
