5|$|Marsden reappears on Albert Square in 2009 when Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) is murdered. She {{arrives on}} the scene when several people say they suspect Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), but Marsden waits before {{questioning}} her, and questions the Mitchells first. She makes a televised appeal for witnesses and later interviews Phil, but he is provided an alibi by his girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). A few days later, a red fingernail is found {{at the scene of}} the murder; Marsden visits the female locals, checking their hands. Seeing an upset Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), knowing that she is vulnerable and lives with Shirley, she talks to Heather about Christmas Day and Heather accidentally tells Marsden that Phil wasn't there. Marsden interviews Phil and later visits his home, asking to see the clothes he was wearing on Christmas Day. Shirley shows her a clean shirt; Marsden closes the laundrette, hoping anyone with blood-stained clothes will not be able to wash them. After a tip-off Marsden arrests Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); Sam accuses her mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), of the murder. Marsden confirms that she was there to talk to Peggy, questioning Peggy and Sam at the police station. Peggy is released without charge; however, Sam is detained for jumping bail. Marsden visits Janine, who insists that people will say <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her in trouble. She asks Janine why she was out in the cold on Christmas Day, and asks if Janine knows where Archie's laptop as it had gone missing.|$|E
25|$|Portrayed as the anti-heroine and femme fatale of the series, Atia is greedy and ambitious, {{and will}} do {{virtually}} <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> what she wants. Seduction, humiliation and violence (including murder) are all tools acceptable to her; Atia's occasional hypocrisy is overshadowed by her general acceptance of her own extremely corrupt and unethical nature. Fiercely protective of her family and their social status, Atia's motives usually involve advancement or self-preservation for the Julii. Her manipulations often extend to her own relatives; feeling that she knows best, Atia will not let even her children thwart her plans. Seeing a more advantageous match, Atia forcibly divorces her daughter Octavia from her first husband (and later has him eliminated).|$|E
25|$|Slytherin house values ambition, cunning, leadership, and resourcefulness; the Sorting Hat said in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone that Slytherins will do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their way. The house mascot of Slytherin is the serpent, and {{the house}} colours are green and silver. Salazar Slytherin founded the house. The Head of House is Severus Snape until the seventh book. Then, Horace Slughorn, the {{previous}} Head of House, comes out of retirement re-assuming authority after Snape becomes headmaster. The ghost of Slytherin house is The Bloody Baron. According to Rowling, Slytherin corresponds roughly to the element of water. The Slytherin dormitories and common room are reached through a bare stone wall in the dungeons. The Slytherin common room is a long, low, dungeon-style room, under the Hogwarts Lake, furnished with green lamps and carved armchairs. The room is described in the second book as having a greenish glow.|$|E

25|$|McKittrick {{remained}} at large for several months, but was finally arrested in Dallas on September 21, 1973, after attempting to cash a forged payroll check at a drive-in bank. Under questioning, she corroborated Vandiver's story, and also told Carpenter and Gamino {{that she had}} met Ash Robinson while she was staying with Lilla Paulus in 1972. McKittrick claimed that Robinson had {{said he would do}} <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> custody of his grandson, but that the only way that would happen was if Hill was dead. She said that Robinson and Paulus had met frequently at Ben Taub Hospital, where money was handed over, and that Robinson had also visited Paulus at her home, where he gave her plans of Hill's home and $7,000 {{on the day of the}} shooting. McKittrick was scheduled to be tried in 1974, alongside Paulus. However, Paulus's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, argued for Vandiver's evidence to be dismissed under the Sixth Amendment, which gives a defendant the right to confront their accuser; the request was granted. DeGuerin also asked for McKittrick's evidence against Paulus to be ruled as inadmissible. But although this request was also granted, presiding Judge Price ruled that McKittrick's evidence could be used in the state's case against her. McKittrick's attorney, John Caperton, then sought consensus for her to enter a not guilty plea, but accept a guilty verdict, something to which Bennett agreed. McKittrick was convicted of being Vandiver's getaway driver and given a ten-year jail sentence. She was paroled after serving five years.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with NME in 2014 whilst promoting his solo debut album Everyday Robots, Damon Albarn hinted at a collaborative project with Gallagher. Despite the years of animosity during Blur and Oasis' respective heyday, Albarn said: [...] "We’re talking. It’s not <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> excited about yet. I mean, he’s doing his thing. He’s finishing a new record. I’ve got my record coming out, but the principle of us making music together is something, you know.

At first, according to Dawson, Darren was [...] "very manipulative" [...] and willing to [...] "do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his own way". Dawson added that some of Darren's actions were [...] "blatantly horrible" [...] although he felt that this made Darren [...] "such a fun character to play". Dawson also commented on Darren's [...] "luck with girls"; Dawson felt that Darren [...] "tends to take girls for granted" [...] and is [...] "out for all he can get". Dawson also called Darren [...] "an opportunist" [...] and a [...] "male chauvinist pig".|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave it a}} {{negative}} review stating, [...] "Thor is a failure as a movie, but a success as marketing, an illustration of the ancient carnival tactic of telling the rubes <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them into the tent". A.O. Scott of The New York Times also disliked the film, calling it [...] "an example of the programmed triumph of commercial calculation over imagination". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times had mixed feelings, describing the film as [...] "an aesthetic stand-off between predictable elements and unexpected ones". [...] Turan praised the performances of Hemsworth, Hopkins, and Elba, but found the special effects inconsistent and the Earth storyline derivative.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Robert Canning of IGN {{did not think}} there was anything [...] "terrible" [...] about the episode, {{but he did not}} think there was <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> excited about, either. Canning thought {{there were a number of}} throwaway jokes in the episode that he felt worked well, [...] "but the episode as a whole failed to grab me. As stated, there are a number of episodes that already fit this mold, and most of those are far superior." [...] Daniel Aughey of TV Guide thought the episode provided a [...] "healthy balance" [...] of humor, story and heart. [...] "Exactly what makes a great Simpsons episode!" [...] Aughey would have liked to see Homer's storyline explored as an A story in its own episode rather than cut short as a C story.|$|E

500|$|The St. Paul Pioneer Press {{observed}} that Gothel represents [...] "an update" [...] {{of the traditional}} wicked stepmother, evolving into [...] "the passive-aggressive stepmother" [...] instead. In actress Donna Murphy's opinion, a [...] "classic" [...] villainess is [...] "somebody who wants something with such intensity and such great need but comes {{to a place of}} not being bound by any kind of moral code or any sense of what’s ethical", concluding that [...] "They will do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> what they want". [...] The Austin Chronicle {{observed that}} the directors' inclusion of Gothel as [...] "an evil mother figure as a trigger for the storyline" [...] remains one of the [...] "classic hallmarks of Disney animation". According to Kay Turner, author of the book Transgressive Tales: Queering the Grimms, [...] "Gothel" [...] means [...] "godmother" [...] in German.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of the film's release, the quality of the Thanhouser films in general stood out amongst the Independent producers.

Crude stories are crudely handled, giving the impression that they are rushed through in a hurry - <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a thousand feet of negative ready for the market. Such pictures, of course, do not cost much to produce, but they are not of a class to make reputation.

[...] All About Soap said Charlie and Darryl's chemistry was [...] "clear for everyone to see" [...] and wondered when she would stop hiding behind her [...] "law-abiding facade". When Charlie and Darryl share their [...] "steamy moment", Erin Miller of TV Week said [...] "It was the moment we've all been waiting for." [...] In 2012, Stephen questioned whether there was another police officer who has had [...] "such a difficult life as Charlie".

500|$|... "The Other Woman" [...] {{contains}} Jack and Juliet's second kiss. [...] Juliet {{was conceived}} by the writers {{as the next}} possible love interest for Jack {{after the death of}} the second season character Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez). [...] Fans hated Ana Lucia so the writers did not pursue the romantic story arc. [...] Mitchell guesses that her character was created because [...] "they needed a bridge between Ben and everyone else, and they needed someone to come in and be a little salt in the oyster of Jack and Kate." [...] She believes that Juliet did genuinely fall in love with Jack, but not knowing whether [...] "her attraction to Jack or her willingness to do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off the island" [...] is more important to her.

500|$|Though {{critics would}} {{reveal that the}} plot {{strained}} plausibility, the little known production details surrounding the film show that the Thanhouser staging was effective to one reviewer.

500|$|The Jesus Vs. Satan {{pay-per-view}} event [...] "Boutin' at the Mountain" [...] is {{a parody}} of similarly advertised pay-to-watch boxing events featured on the premium cable channel HBO.

Cartman insults Damien by asking if he got his haircut from Stevie Wonder, a blind soul and R singer. For his birthday, Cartman wants the complete line of a set of action figures called Mega Man. Although named Mega Man, the multi-colored figures were actually inspired by the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the 1993 children's action series which was still popular {{at the time of the}} episode's original broadcast. The script was originally written with direct references to the Power Rangers, but Comedy Central asked Parker and Stone to change the name due to copyright issues. Cartman receives Ants in the Pants, an actual children's tabletop game, as a birthday present. Stone described Ants in the Pants as [...] "the lamest game ever", which is why Cartman responds so negatively to the gift in the episode.|$|E
500|$|So many Southern Rhodesians were {{withdrawn}} from the trenches for officer training that in mid-1915 Brady appealed through the Salisbury and Bulawayo presses for more volunteers to replace {{those who had been}} commissioned. A platoon of Southern Rhodesians with the 2nd Battalion, KRRC took part in the [...] "big push" [...] of 1 July 1916, {{the first day of the}} Battle of the Somme, charging German positions elsewhere on the line early that morning. There were 90 Rhodesians on the eve of the attack and only 10 alive and unwounded afterwards. On the Somme battlefield itself, Rhodesians were among those at Delville Wood, which began on 14 July. This was the South African 1st Infantry Brigade's first engagement, and some of the colonials blacked up and imitated Zulu battle cries and war dances. Despite suffering casualties of catastrophic proportions—about 80% of the brigade's personnel were killed, wounded or captured—they took the Wood and held it as ordered until they were relieved on 20 July. By the time of its withdrawal, the South African Brigade, originally numbering 3,155 (123 officers and 3,032 other ranks), had been reduced to 19 officers and 600 men. Delville Wood was later described by Sir BH Liddell Hart as [...] "the bloodiest battle hell of 1916". [...] "God knows I never wish to see such horrible sights again," [...] a Southern Rhodesian veteran of the battle wrote home; [...] "at times I wished it would come fast, <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of that terrible death-trap and murderous place." ...|$|E
