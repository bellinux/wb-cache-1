The {{mammary gland}} {{actively}} concentrates iodine into milk {{for the benefit}} of the developing infant, and may develop a goiter-like hyperplasia, sometimes manifesting as fibrocystic breast disease, when iodine level is low. Studies indicate that iodine deficiency, either dietary or pharmacologic, can lead to breast atypia and increased incidence of malignancy in animal models, while iodine treatment can reverse dysplasia, with elemental iodine (I2) having been found to be more effective in reducing ductal hyperplasias and perilobular fibrosis in iodine-deficient rats than iodide (I&minus;). On the observation that Japanese women who consume iodine-rich seaweed have a relatively low rate of breast cancer, iodine is suggested as a protection against breast cancer. Iodine is known to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Laboratory evidence has demonstrated an effect of iodine on breast cancer that is in part independent of thyroid function, with iodine inhibiting cancer through modulation of the estrogen pathway. Gene array profiling of the estrogen responsive breast cancer cell line shows that the combination of iodine and iodide alters gene expression and inhibits the estrogen response through up-regulating proteins involved in estrogen metabolism. Whether iodine/iodide will be useful as an adjuvant therapy in the pharmacologic manipulation of the estrogen pathway in women with breast cancer has not been determined clinically.* Iodine and stomach cancer. Some researchers have found an epidemiologic correlation between iodine deficiency, iodine-deficient goitre, and gastric cancer; a decrease in the death incidence from stomach cancer after iodine-prophylaxis. In the proposed mechanism, the iodide ion functions in gastric mucosa as an <b>antioxidant</b> <b>reducing</b> species that detoxifies poisonous reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide.|$|E

40|$|Insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) is a {{naturally}} occurring peptide that exerts known pleiotropic effects ranging from metabolic modulation to cellular development, growth and survival. IGF-II triggers its actions by binding to and activating IGF (IGF-I and IGF-II) receptors. In this study, we assessed the neuroprotective effect of IGF-II on corticosterone-induced oxidative damage in adult cortical neuronal cultures {{and the role}} of IGF-II receptors in this effect. We provide evidence that treatment with IGF-II alleviates the glucocorticoid-induced toxicity to neuronal cultures, and this neuroprotective effect occurred due to a decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a return of the antioxidant status to normal levels. IGF-II acts via not only the regulation of synthesis and/or activity of antioxidant enzymes, especially manganese superoxide dismutase, but also the restoration of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity and mitochondrial membrane potential. Although the antioxidant effect of IGF-I receptor activation has been widely reported, the involvement of the IGF-II receptor in these processes has not been clearly defined. The present report is the first evidence describing the involve- ment of IGF-II receptors in redox homeostasis. IGF-II may therefore contribute to the mechanisms of neuropro- tection by acting as an <b>antioxidant,</b> <b>reducing</b> the neurodegeneration induced by oxidative insults.

40|$|Abstract The {{maintenance}} of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes {{is still a}} major enigma in evolutionary biology. Meiosis represents the only common feature of sex in all eukaryotic kingdoms, and thus, we regard it a key issue for discussing its function. Almost all asexuality modes maintain meiosis either in a modified form or as an alter-native pathway, and facultatively apomictic plants increase frequencies of sexuality relative to apomixis after abiotic stress. On the physiological level, abiotic stress causes oxidative stress. We hypothesize that repair of oxidative damage on nuclear DNA could be a major driving force {{in the evolution of}} meiosis. We present a hypothetical model for the possible redox chemistry that underlies the binding of the meiosis-specific protein Spo 11 to DNA. During prophase of meiosis I, oxidized sites at the DNA molecule are being targeted by the catalytic tyrosine moieties of Spo 11 protein, which acts like an <b>antioxidant</b> <b>reducing</b> the oxidized target. The oxidized tyrosine residues, tyrosyl radicals, attack the phosphodiester bonds of the DNA backbone causing DNA double strand breaks that can be repaired by various mechanisms. Polyploidy in apomictic plants could mitigate oxidative DNA damage and decrease Spo 11 activation. Our hypothesis may contribute to explaining various enigmatic phenomena: first, DSB for-mation outnumbers crossovers and, thus, effective recom-bination events by far because the target of meiosis may be the removal of oxidative lesions; second, it offers an argument for why expression of sexuality is responsive to stress in many eukaryotes; and third, repair of oxidative DNA damage turns meiosis into an essential characteristic of eukaryotic reproduction...|$|E

We investigated the early effects of oxLDL and α-tocopherol on c-Myc, its binding partner Max, and the carboxy-terminal domain–binding factors activator protein- 2 and elongation 2 factor in human coronary SMCs. We also investigated whether 9 -week treatment of Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits with diet-enriched α-tocopherol reduces c-Myc expression and oxLDL in the left coronary artery. Methods and Results. OxLDL enhanced c-Myc/Max expression and transcription by cotransfection assay and the nuclear activities of E 2 F and activator protein- 2 by binding shift and supershift in coronary SMCs. a-Tocopherol significantly reduced these molecular events.

No study to date has determined the independent and combined impact of dietary intake and cigarette smoking on blood antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress in a sample of young, novice smokers. Methods We compared resting plasma <b>antioxidant</b> <b>reducing</b> capacity (ARC; expressed in uric acid equivalents), serum trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), whole blood total glutathione, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), and plasma oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) between 15 young (24 ± 4 years), novice smokers (pack-year history: 3 ± 2) and 13 nonsmokers of similar age (24 ± 5 years). Detailed dietary records were maintained during a seven-day period for analysis of total energy, macro- and micronutrient intake. Results ARC (0. 0676 ± 0. 0352 vs. 0. 1257 ± 0. 0542 mmol·L - 1; mean ± SD, p = 0. 019), TEAC (0. 721 ± 0. 120 vs. 0. 765 ± 0. 130 mmol·L - 1, p = 0. 24) and glutathione (835 ± 143 vs. 898 ± 168 μmol·L - 1, p = 0. 28) were lower in smokers compared to nonsmokers, with only the former being statistically significant. MDA (0. 919 ± 0. 32 vs. 0. 647 ± 0. 16 μmol·L - 1, p = 0. 05) and oxLDL were both higher in smokers compared to nonsmokers (229 ± 94 vs. 110 ± 62 ng·mL - 1, p = 0. 12), although only the MDA comparison was of statistical significance. Interestingly, these findings existed despite no differences in dietary intake, including antioxidant micronutrient consumption, between both smokers and nonsmokers.

HAEC were incubated with 1 - 30 mu M quercetin, 3 '- or 4 '-O-methyl-quercetin, quercetin- 3 -O-glucuronide, and quercetin- 3 '-O-sulfate or 20 - 100 mu M EGCG, 4 ''-O-methyl-EGCG, and 4 ', 4 ''-di-O-methyl-EGCG, prior to coincubation with 100 U/ml of TNF alpha. 3 '-O-Methyl-quercetin, 4 '-O-methyl-quercetin, and their parent aglycone compound, quercetin, all effectively inhibited expression of intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) with IC 50 values (concentration required for 50 % inhibition) of 8. 0, 5. 0, and 4. 4 mu M, respectively: E-selectin expression was suppressed to a somewhat lesser but still significant degree by all three compounds, whereas vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) was not affected. In contrast, quercetin- 3 -O-glucuronide (20 - 100 mu M), quercetin- 3 '-O-sulfate (10 - 30 mu M), and phenolic acid metabolites of quercetin (20 - 100 mu M) did not inhibit adhesion molecule expression. 4 ', 4 ''-Di-O-methyl-EGCG selectively inhibited ICAM- 1 expression with an IC 50 value of 94 mu M, whereas EGCG (20 - 60 mu M) and 4 ''-O-methyl-EGCG (20 - 100 mu M) had no effect. The inhibitory effects of 3 '-O-methyl-quercetin and 4 ', 4 ''-di-O-methyl-EGCG on adhesion molecule expression were not related either to inhibition of NF-kappa B activation or to their <b>antioxidant</b> <b>reducing</b> capacity. Our data indicate that flavonoid metabolites have different biological and antioxidant properties than their parent compounds, and suggest that data from in vitro studies using nonmetabolites of flavonoids are of limited relevance in vivo.

40|$|Introduction: Citrus juices are {{important}} sources of health-promoting compounds. Orange juice, in particular, {{is rich in}} natural antioxidants, such as vitamin C. Human plasma levels of L-ascorbic acid are entirely dependent on dietary sources, such as fruits and vegetables, since {{we are unable to}} synthesize this vitamin. Moreover, evidence shows that in a great percentage of the population, plasma levels of this vitamin are suboptimal for the beneficial health effects of vitamin C. This important compound acts as an <b>antioxidant,</b> <b>reducing</b> the risk of cardiovascular diseases, arteriosclerosis and some forms of cancer. Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for vitamin C was established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences. Values given for healthy males and females, > 19 years, are 90 mg/day and 75 mg/day, respectively. Objectives: To determine total vitamin C content, L-ascorbic acid and L-dehydroascorbic acid in six samples of orange juice (one nectar, three concentrated juices, one filtrated freshly squeezed juice and one non-filtrated freshly squeezed juice) and to evaluate the nutritional value of these juices as a source of vitamin C. Materials and methods: The oranges and orange juices were acquired in local supermarkets, and only the edible portion was analyzed. Vitamin C content was determined by a highly precise and accurate High Performance Liquid Chromatography method coupled with a photodiode array detector, previously validated. The total vitamin C content was determined by reducing dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbic acid (adding a reducing agent tris(2 -carboxyethyl) phosphine). Results and discussion: Total vitamin C content in the analysed samples varied between 42. 5 ± 0. 7 and 66. 4 ± 0. 2 mg/ 100 g of edible portion, for nectar and concentrated juice, respectively. The highest ascorbic acid value and the lowest dehydroascorbic acid content (60. 9 ± 0. 3 and 1. 3 ± 0. 6 mg/ 100 g of edible portion, respectively) were observed in the concentrated juice. The freshly squeezed juices presented higher vitamin C and ascorbic acid contents than the nectar. Considering an intake of 100 mL of juice, the commercial juices can supply 57 % to 88 % of DRI for females and 36 % to 61 % of DRI for males. With respect to freshly squeezed orange juice, 100 mL can contribute with 66 % and 51 % of DRI, for females and males, respectively. Conclusions: Taking into account the established DRI, orange juices can be considered a good source of vitamin C. Most of the vitamin C content in the analysed orange juices is due to the presence of L-ascorbic acid, which is the main biologically active form of this vitamin and it is an effective antioxidant. Since orange juice is an important and highly consumed source of vitamin C, and due to the wide range of different types of orange juices available in the market, it is essential to analyse total vitamin C content (L-ascorbic and L-dehydroascorbic).
