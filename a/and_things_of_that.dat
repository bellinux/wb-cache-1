500|$|After Readys success, Songz {{explained}} that the album {{was a result of}} his growth and new-found maturity. Commenting about the success of his singles, Songz stated that [...] "they're very strong records and they're not just radio records. They're records that embody the person I am as well as the artist I am. I think they're more definitive of who I am than any other album I've had. I've grown as an artist. I've been doing this [...] now. As I've matured, I've learned how to exude that of which I want to be felt.

He said of her in 1968 that she was [...] "a walking encyclopedia. All through her life she stored up knowledge on all sorts of subjects, {{and she had the}} great gift of being able to make it all interesting when she taught it to me. She was completely methodical; we had time-tables for each subject, and I had to do preparation, and so forth. She taught me to enjoy working hard, and to be thorough. She was outspoken and open-minded to a degree quite unusual in members of the Royal Family.

Goodier (mechanical {{engineer and}} academic), Sir Morien Morgan (called the [...] "Father of Concorde") and Beryl Platt, Baroness Platt (Conservative peer). [...] He was also in contact with Russian railway engineer Yury Lomonosov and lectured to biochemist Albert Chibnall. [...] Despite mentoring {{some of the best}} engineers of their generation Inglis was realistic about the actual intentions of many of his students at the time. [...] He once told a new intake class: [...] "Your fathers, gentlemen, have sent you to Cambridge to be educated, not to become engineers. They think, however, that reading engineering is a very good way of becoming educated. In 10 years' time, however, 90% of you will have become managers, whether of design, manufacturing, sales, research or even accounts departments in industry. The remaining 10% of you will have become successful lawyers, novelists, <b>and</b> <b>things</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> sort". [...] Undeterred, Inglis sought to give his students the broadest possible engineering education, covering all fields to prevent them becoming [...] "cramped by premature specialisation".|$|E
500|$|In August 2009, Milian {{confirmed}} {{that she had}} signed a deal to release Elope through Interscope Records, with a 2010 release date. Originally scheduled {{to be released in}} 2009, Tricky Stewart explained the delay, saying [...] "we just got our label deals done, so the reason why some of these projects got delayed had to do with technicalities <b>and</b> <b>things</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> nature". The album has been furthered delayed because of Milian's marriage to The-Dream and her pregnancy. In January 2010, Milian said that she was going back into the studio in the summer to record more material. Although the album had already been finished when Milian took a break for her pregnancy, she wanted to [...] "go back and re-do some of the music and make some new songs and find my new inspiration". In October 2009, Tricky Stewart said that another single had yet to be chosen, {{and that it would be}} the first single off Elope.

500|$|The New 52 ongoing {{series are}} {{organized}} under seven different [...] "families," [...] grouping similar characters or themes within the books together. By {{the release of}} the October 2013 solicitations, DC was no longer grouping the titles by these families. They instead began releasing one larger solicit, titled [...] "The New 52 Group". However, titles that were not participating in an event for the month, such as [...] "Forever Evil", were still grouped together in the larger solicit by the previous family headings. In September 2014, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio spoke about classifying the titles into the families, saying, [...] "one of the things we did, when we launched the New 52, we broke those classifications up {{in a way that we}} were able to draw attention to all the characters. So we put them in groupings so we would be able to promote and help them draw attention in groups. It was never made to be a certain amount different stuff. We always want to have different styles of product... with a lot of characters, we're careful. Things like Frankenstein and Grifter and Voodoo <b>and</b> <b>things</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> nature, which were really risky characters and risky chances for us to take, and we're very happy to do them. Even though they didn't work, we knew there was value in those characters... We think they brought a lot of value to the launch. They brought a lot of breadth and depth to the line of books, and a diversity to the line. We didn't want to put them out and then forget about them. It was very important to make sure that they were prominent in other series, and that's why we put them in" [...] other series.|$|E

Snyder confirmed that prior to the set production date, he already shot some fantasy sequences for Sucker Punch. Snyder said the film is a [...] "stylized motion picture about action and sort of landscapes of the imagination <b>and</b> <b>things</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> nature". Snyder had also been decided on the film's title for some time, stating it is a pop-culture reference.

2500|$|In 1952, Young stunned {{observers}} when {{he appeared}} before the McCarthy era House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) and defied the congressmen with sarcastic retorts and repeatedly refused to answer {{whether or not he}} was a member of the Communist Party. The encounter came at a highly publicized formal hearing in Detroit. Young’s performance made him a hero in Detroit’s growing black community. [...] On HUAC’s charge that he seemed reluctant to fight communism, Coleman said: “I am not here to fight in any un-American activities, because I consider the denial of the right to vote to large numbers of people all over the South un-American.” On the HUAC congressman from Georgia: “I happen to know, in Georgia, Negro people are prevented from voting by virtue of terror, intimidation and lynchings. It is my contention you would not be in Congress today if it were not for the legal restrictions on voting on the part of my people.” [...] On the HUAC committee: “Congressman, neither me or none of my friends were at this plant the other day brandishing a rope in the face of John Cherveny, a young union organizer and factory worker who was threatened with repeated violence after members of the HUAC alleged that he might be a communist, I can assure you I have had no part in the hanging or bombing of Negroes in the South. I have not been responsible for firing a person from his job for what I think are his beliefs, or what somebody thinks he believes in, <b>and</b> <b>things</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> sort.
