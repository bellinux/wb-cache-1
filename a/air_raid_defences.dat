5000|$|<b>Air</b> <b>raid</b> {{protection}} police (Luftschutzpolizei) was {{the civil}} protection service {{in charge of}} <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>defence</b> and rescue victims of bombings {{in connection with the}} Technische Nothilfe (Technical Emergency Service) and the Feuerschutzpolizei (professional fire departments). Created as the Security and Assistance Service (Sicherheits und Hilfsdienst) in 1935, it was renamed Luftschutzpolizei in April 1942. The <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> network was supported by the Reichsluftschutzbund (Reich Association for <b>Air</b> <b>Raid</b> Precautions) an organization controlled from 1935 by the Air Ministry under Hermann Göring. The RLB set up an organization of <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> wardens who were responsible for the safety of a building or a group of houses.|$|R
5000|$|King {{had promised}} Manion {{that he would}} not call an {{election}} due to the war but reversed his pledge and called a March 1940 general election taking Manion's Tories by surprise and unprepared. They campaigned under the name [...] "National Government" [...] with the platform of forming a wartime coalition government. The renamed Tories were unable to make any gains from their 1935 result, and Manion failed to win his seat, leading to his resignation as party leader two months later. Manion was subsequently appointed director of Civilian <b>Air</b> <b>Raid</b> <b>Defence.</b> He died in 1943.|$|R
40|$|The Polish {{national}} historiography remains {{silent on}} the reconstruction of damaged towns and cities that was undertaken by the German administration after capturing Poland in September 1939. This paper, on the war-time restoration of the National Economy Bank’s headquarters in Warsaw, {{is an attempt to}} at least partially fill the gap. Designed by celebrated architect Rudolf Świerczyński in the late 1920 s in accordance with contemporary <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>defence</b> regulations, it was bombed and nevertheless seriously damaged during the September Campaign. Under the German management of the bank, the building was reconstructed and even modernized by commissioned Polish engineers...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the years}} of the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945, Leningrad fine art was quite {{literally}} [...] "in the front line of the fight against the enemy". In the very first days following the Nazi invasion on 22 June 1941, artists joined in preparing more than a million exhibits from the stocks of the Hermitage and Russian Museum for evacuation. The first train carrying them left for the East on 1 July. An even greater quantity of museum items were moved into temporary storage places. Tremendous work was carried out to protect and camouflage sculptural monuments, military, civic and industrial objects. The production of posters and wartime leaflets began. Artists participated in the construction of defensive installations and served in <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> <b>defence</b> units. Publication of the [...] "Boyevoy karandash" [...] ("Fighting Pencil") was resumed. As early as 24 June Vladimir Serov’s poster We Have Beaten, Are Beating and Will Beat! appeared on the streets of Leningrad and in the window of the former Yeliseyev Shop on Nevsky Prospekt the first issue of the [...] "TASS Windows" [...] was put on display. In all, during the war years the [...] "Fighting Pencil" [...] produced 103 posters with print-runs between 3,000 and 15,000 copies, executed in the traditions of the lubok popular print, politically sharp and inventive.|$|R
40|$|In the 1930 s the British {{government}} {{developed a}} system of <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> precautions as a measure against the aerial warfare which was increasingly becoming a feature of contemporary conflict. The <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> precautions system devised by the British government entailed, amongst other measures, {{the creation of a}} range of organizations such as the Auxiliary Fire Service and the Warden’s Service which depended upon the voluntary enrolment of British civilians for their success. This article traces the history of these organizations between 1937 and 1941, examining the discourse of citizenship which was drawn upon in their creation, recruitment campaigns and structure. Drawing on a range of primary sources, including government papers, parliamentary debates, press coverage and Mass Observation surveys, the article argues that the discourse of citizenship which was apparent in <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> precautions was complicated by issues of gender. The article concludes that the articulation of <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> precautions as an example of active citizenship had the potential to compromise the continuity of gendered identities in wartime and that the attempts visible within civil defence planning, representation and organization to preserve these identities should be understood as representing the threat that <b>air</b> <b>raids,</b> and <b>defence</b> against them, posed to the relationship between masculinity and femininity...|$|R
50|$|During World War II, both Cowes and East Cowes {{became the}} targets of {{frequent}} bombing due to its industry and proximity to Southampton and the Royal Navy's home at Portsmouth. The shipyard of J. Samuel White was badly damaged by air attack in early May 1942 but, when rebuilt, innovative ship construction methods had been introduced. The first warship completed by the renewed yard was HMS Cavalier. During the <b>air</b> <b>raid,</b> the local <b>defences</b> had been fortuitously augmented by the Polish destroyer Blyskawica (itself built by White's), which put up such a determined defence that, in 2002, the crew's courage was honoured by a local commemoration lasting several days to mark the 60th anniversary of the event. Later in 2004, and over to the west, an area of Cowes was named Francki Place in honour of the ship's commander.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, {{concerns}} about <b>air</b> <b>raids</b> by Japan {{resulted in the}} construction of many <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> shelters in Brisbane. Two <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> shelters were constructed at the eastern and western ends of Raymond Park. Although most <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> shelters were demolished after the war, the eastern and western <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> shelters in Raymond Park are among the handful to survive, albeit with their outer walls removed.

50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>Raid</b> Precautions were {{introduced}} in January 1942 and the <b>Air</b> <b>Raid</b> Wardens had the responsibility to ensure compliance with the regulations within the community. Black-out curtains and slit trenches became part of every home in the Cairns area. <b>Air</b> <b>raid</b> practice drills were held {{on a regular basis}} both in the daytime and evenings, and during drills people on the streets were required to move to the nearest <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> shelter.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war Dresden hardly seemed threatened by <b>air</b> <b>raids,</b> so initially insufficient preparations were made and later additional preparations were no longer possible. The <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> shelters of the central station could accommodate about 2,000 people, but they lacked airlocks and ventilation systems. This had serious consequences: during the great <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> on the night of 13 and 14 February 1945 the station burned down, and the entrance to the luggage store was set alight; as a result 100 people were burned to death and another 500 people suffocated in the <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> shelters.|$|R
