5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Josephson took up {{transcendental}} meditation {{and turned his}} attention to issues outside the boundaries of mainstream science. He set up the Mind–Matter Unification Project at the Cavendish to explore the idea of intelligence in nature, the relationship between quantum mechanics <b>and</b> <b>consciousness,</b> and the synthesis of science and Eastern mysticism, broadly known as quantum mysticism. Those interests have led him to express support for topics such as parapsychology, water memory and cold fusion, and have made him a focus of criticism from fellow scientists.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} yoga <b>and</b> {{meditation}} on <b>consciousness</b> <b>and</b> mindfulness were examined comparing beginners, intermediate, advanced meditators {{and a group}} of non-meditators. The three experimental groups improved from pre-test to post-test compared to control group, highlighting the benefits of yoga <b>and</b> meditation on <b>consciousness</b> <b>and</b> mindfulness. <b>Consciousness</b> of advanced meditators was highest in comparison to other groups at pre-test. <b>Consciousness</b> <b>and</b> mindfulness of beginners increased at a faster rate over time. Further, the effect of intervention was examined on physical, emotional, cognitive, social, spiritual and self-consciousness. There was significant increase in social and self-consciousness after 11 weeks of intervention whereas physical <b>and</b> emotional <b>consciousness</b> increased significantly post intervention which was for 20 weeks. Although there was increase in cognitive <b>and</b> spiritual <b>consciousness</b> but it was not significant. A longer duration of practice may prove helpful for betterment of these faculties...|$|R

5|$|During the Enlightenment and its {{debates about}} human origins, it became fashionable to {{speculate}} {{about the origin of}} language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led {{to the question of whether}} philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition <b>and</b> <b>consciousness</b> remain active today.|$|E
5|$|In {{between the}} time Scott {{released}} Alien in 1979 {{and returned to the}} franchise with Prometheus in 2012, he directed another notable science fiction film concerning artificial intelligence, Blade Runner, in 1982. Contrary to the white-blooded androids of Alien that emulate emotions and recognize a disconnect with humanity, Blade Runner features the replicants- enhanced biorobotic humanoids that may only be identified by their lacking emotions. In order to maintain control, the replicants' human creators install false memories that detail entire lives that give them a sense of identity. Blade Runner, a largely influential film, has prompted a slew of philosophical questions concerning artificial intelligence and whether or not an android could truly be considered alive. The film specifically questions whether thoughts, a sense of identity, emotions <b>and</b> <b>consciousness</b> in general, may be something genuine when applied to artificial intelligence. Due to David identifying himself as a living entity - similar to the replicants - film critics in 2012 would come not to only question if Prometheus was a direct prequel to Alien, but if the film had a relation to Blade Runner.|$|E

40|$|AbstractConsidering {{the fact}} that {{personal}} and social awareness of individuals matures, the anti-consumptional attitudes become more common. In this context, this study aims to reveal the main motivators behind anti-consumptional attitudes {{by focusing on the}} relationships among personality dimensions, environmental <b>consciousness,</b> health <b>consciousness</b> <b>and</b> anti-consumption. A Structural Equation Model is developed to examine the factors that impact anti-consumptional attitudes. Studying on the explanatory impacts of personality dimensions on anti-consumption, environmental <b>consciousness</b> <b>and</b> health <b>consciousness</b> are included into the model as moderators. 503 questionnaires are collected to analyse the relationships among the model variables. While SPSS 18. 0 is used for all data screening tests, exploratory factor analysis and reliability statistics, LISREL– 8. 51 Statistical Program is used for measurement and structural model assessments. The study reveals several crucial findings related to significant impacts of proposed antecedents on anti-consumptional attitudes. First, it is found that among the personality dimensions responsibility consciousness has significant effects on both environmental <b>consciousness</b> <b>and</b> health <b>consciousness.</b> Secondly, agreeableness is also found to have positive significant effects on environmental <b>consciousness</b> <b>and</b> health <b>consciousness</b> as the most explanatory variable. Lastly, both health <b>and</b> environmental <b>consciousness</b> have positive significant impacts on anti-consumptional attitudes of anti-consumers...|$|R
