40|$|As {{part of an}} {{experimental}} approach to “red teaming” that is studying the problem of enemy <b>access</b> <b>denial</b> systems, the author performed a detailed investigation of the vulnerabilities of the U. S. military’s power projection capabilities. The primary purpose of this document is to facilitate out-of-the-box thinking by future “red teams”. Thirty-six separate areas of vulnerability relevant to <b>access</b> <b>denial</b> were identified The vulnerabilities span all ranges from tactical to strategic, from weapons to logistics, and from military to societal. The agreement between this “list” of vulnerabilities and a previous list prepared independently by the Defense Science Board is striking. There is additional strong support for this list in the specific weapons systems that the three different “red teams” involved in the <b>access</b> <b>denial</b> study (all of whom preceded the completion of this study) opted to develop for their 2020 epoch force structures. Each of the 36 vulnerabilities identified here is examined in detail to define {{the nature of that}} vulnerability, its causes, and the things that affect it. In addition, specific ways in which a potential “near peer competitor” could exploit those vulnerabilities to enhance his <b>access</b> <b>denial</b> capability are discussed. In addition to it future use in “red teaming”, it is expected that this analysis can aid: • U.

30|$|Various {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} regarding the fusion of sensing outputs in CR environments. Three common fusion approaches are implemented {{in the form of}} the OR-rule, the AND-rule, and the voting-rule.

With the voting-rule, a PU is declared to be present if more than a given fraction of the sensors are able to detect its activity [15]. In general terms, the OR-rule is the most commonly used approach, especially when a hard-decision approach is followed. In particular, Clouquer et al. [22] consider that this rule achieves the best performance in the presence of a hard decision. However, when the OR-rule is applied, the potential impact of the false spectrum <b>access</b> <b>denial</b> problem (i.e., when access is denied despite the SU being out of the region of potential interference) increases as the number of CRs increases [23].|$|E

Instead, China’s development of a limited naval power-projection capability reflects changes in China’s threat environment and expanded Chinese national interests created by deeper integration into the world economy. In our critique, we first identify flaws in Ross’s geopolitical analysis. Second, we discuss shortcomings in his causal argument. Lastly, we briefly present Chinese rationales for the development of limited power-projection capabilities, which are consistent with a proper understanding of Chinese interests...|$|E

The standard makes no provisions for faulty, selfish or malicious behavior assuming that nodes always act {{according to the}} specifications of the protocol. Thus, nodes running defective protocol implementations, misconfigured, or compromised can potentially cause significant disruption in the network.

40|$|Nowadays {{the mobile}} {{networks}} are everywhere. The world {{is becoming more}} dependent on wireless and mobile services, but {{the rapid growth of}} these technologies usually underestimates security aspects. As wireless and mobile services grow, weaknesses in network infrastructures become clearer. One of the problems is privacy. Wireless technologies can reduce costs, increase efficiencies, and make important information more readily and widely available. But, there are also risks. Without appropriate safeguards, these data can be read and modified by unauthorized users. There are many solutions, less and more effective, to protect the data from unauthorized users. But, a specific application could distinguish more data flows between authorized users. Protect the privacy of these information between subsets of users is not a trivial problem. Another problem is the reliability of the wireless service. Multi-vehicle systems composed of Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are largely used for industrial transportation in manufacturing and logistics systems. These vehicles use a mobile wireless network to exchange information in order to coordinate their tasks and movements. The reliable dissemination of these information is a crucial operation, because the AGVs may achieve an inconsistent view of the system leading to the failure of the coordination task. This has clear safety implications. Going more in deep, even if the communication are confidential and reliable, anyway the positioning information could be corrupted. Usually, vehicles get the positioning information through a secondary wireless network system such as GPS. Nevertheless, the widespread civil GPS is extremely fragile in adversarial scenarios. An insecure distance or position estimation could produce security problems such as unauthorized <b>accesses,</b> <b>denial</b> of service, thefts, integrity disruption with possible safety implications and intentional disasters. In this dissertation, we face these three problems, proposing an original solution for each one...|$|R

In this paper a stateless model is proposed to prevent ICMP tunneling. A Linux kernel module was implemented to demonstrate the proposed stateless solution. The module enforces a fixed payload policy for ICMP packets and virtually eliminates ICMP tunneling which arises due to the data carrying capability of ICMP. The performance impact on end hosts and routers due to the stateless monitoring model is described. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{working paper}} explores {{the rise of}} cyber-humanitarianism, that is, the {{increasing}} reliance of remote and smart Net-based technologies in humanitarian management. It does this by charting how the understanding of disaster has shifted from modernist concerns to protect from external disaster events to present-day attempts to modulate internal social and economic processes that strengthen the disaster-resilience of vulnerable populations. The paper argues that resilience, reflecting its conversation with neoliberalism, has a double-truth structure. In response to increased perceptions of risk, far from embracing future uncertainty as aid policy advocates, aid managers are reducing their own exposure by retreating into gated aid-complexes. Where resilience is applied to international aid workers, it focuses on narcissistic and subjective forms of care-of-the self, now an essential characteristic {{of life in the}} bunker. In overcoming the growing problem of <b>access</b> <b>denial</b> and remoteness within disaster zones, cyber-humanitarianism is explored in terms of its overcoming terrestrial barriers while simultaneously making possible hyper-bunkered forms of aid management driven by an uncritical technological-determinist vision of modulating the moods, expectations and actions of remote disaster-affected populations.

The LINDO framework is an open system that manages the indexing, storage and retrieval of multimedia contents that are distributed in different remote servers and generated in a real time basis.

When considering the pervasive and mobile access to the managed content, the need of an access control becomes essential.

40|$|This Article {{presents}} an empirical analysis of how race, income inequality, the regional {{history of the}} South, and state politics affect the development of tort law. Beginning in the mid- 1960 s, most state appellate courts rejected doctrines such as contributory negligence that traditionally prevented plaintiffs’ cases from reaching the jury. We examine why some, mostly Southern states did not join this trend. To enable cross-state comparisons, we design an innovative Jury <b>Access</b> <b>Denial</b> Index (JADI) that quantifies {{the extent to which}} each state’s tort doctrines enable judges to dismiss cases before they reach the jury. We then conduct a multivariate analysis that finds strong correlations between a state’s JADI and two factors: (1) the percentage of African Americans in its largest cities, and (2) its history as a former slave-holding state. These findings suggest that some appellate courts, particularly those in the South, afraid that juries with substantial African-American representation would redistribute wealth or retaliate for grievances, struck preemptively to prevent cases from reaching them. Surprisingly, we do not find a consistent association between a state’s JADI and either income inequality or its political leanings. In other words, race and region, rather than economic class or politics, explain the failure to embrace pro-plaintiff changes that occurred elsewhere. We suggest, therefore, that states that declined to discard antiquated anti-jury substantive doctrines between the mid- 1960 s and the mid- 1980 s should acknowledge that these precedents were tainted by their predecessors’ efforts to keep tort cases from African-American jurors and refuse to accord them deference...|$|E

40|$|For {{more than}} a decade, many network administrators have relied on SNMP, the Simple Network Management Protocol, to monitor and manage network devices. Now in its third release, SNMP has become the de facto {{standard}} for network management since its development in 1987. However, a recent report from the computer security watchdog CERT Coordination Center 1 indicates that vulnerabilities in many SNMP implementations have left the products of more 100 vendors vulnerable to attack. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized privileged <b>access,</b> <b>denial</b> of service attacks, or other undesirable behaviors. HOW SNMP WORKS SNMP is popular for network management because of its simplicity. Commonly used to manage network devices such as routers, switches, hubs, printers, workstations, and servers, SNMP employs only three general types of SNMP operations. Get requests retrieve management data from the device, set requests modify the remote device’s configuration, and trap messages let a device send asynchronous notification and signal condition changes. A network management system usually consists of two primary elements: a network management station (NMS) and SNMP agents. The NMS is the console through which an administrator performs management functions. Agents are the entities that interface to the actual device being managed. The primary communication protocol in SNMP is UDP, the User Datagram Protocol. While SNMP agents listen on UDP port 161 to receive requests from the NMS, the NMS listens on UDP port 162 to receive asynchronous traps. Figure 1 shows a simplified SNMP architecture, where the dynamic port is assigned by the operating system. SNMP supports trivial authentication by using a community name, {{which serves as a}} password for either retrieving or modifying management data...|$|E
40|$|The {{major goal}} of this {{dissertation}} is to enhance software security by provably correct enforcement of in-depth policies. In-depth security policies allude to heterogeneous specification of security strategies that are required to be followed before and after sensitive operations. Prospective security is the enforcement of security, or detection of security violations before the execution of sensitive operations, e. g., in authorization, authentication and information flow. Retrospective security refers to security checks after the execution of sensitive operations, which is accomplished through accountability and deterrence. Retrospective security frameworks are built upon auditing {{in order to provide}} sufficient evidence to hold users accountable for their actions and potentially support other remediation actions. Correctness and efficiency of audit logs play significant roles in reaching the accountability goals that are required by retrospective, and consequently, in-depth security policies. This dissertation addresses correct audit logging in a formal framework. Leveraging retrospective controls beside the existing prospective measures enhances security in numerous applications. This dissertation focuses on two major application spaces for in-depth enforcement. The first is to enhance prospective security through surveillance and accountability. For example, authorization mechanisms could be improved by guaranteed retrospective checks in environments where there is a high cost of <b>access</b> <b>denial,</b> e. g., healthcare systems. The second application space is the amelioration of potentially flawed prospective measures through retrospective checks. For instance, erroneous implementations of input sanitization methods expose vulnerabilities in taint analysis tools that enforce direct flow of data integrity policies. In this regard, we propose an in-depth enforcement framework to mitigate such problems. We also propose a general semantic notion of explicit flow of information integrity in a high-level language with sanitization. This dissertation studies the ways by which prospective and retrospective security could be enforced uniformly in a provably correct manner to handle security challenges in legacy systems. Provable correctness of our results relies on the formal Programming Languages-based approach that we have taken in order to provide software security assurance. Moreover, this dissertation includes the implementation of such in-depth enforcement mechanisms for a medical records web application...|$|E
40|$|Japan {{has been}} {{regarded}} by all mainstream International Relations theories as a status quo power intent on pursuing an immobilist international strategy toward China characterized by hedging {{rather than any}} move to active balancing. This paper challenges these assumptions and asks whether Japan will, or indeed already is, moving toward active balancing. The paper does so by reinterpreting the very assumptions of those theoretical perspectives that predict only hedging and by drawing on fresh empirical evidence. It argues that the conditions that are thought to encourage hedging behavior—the predictability of other states’ intentions, the malleability of intentions through engagement, domestic preferences that obviate balancing, and a favorable offense-defense balance—are now deteriorating {{in the case of}} Japan’s strategy toward China. Japanese policy-makers over the last decade have experienced an accelerated decline in their confidence to read China’s intentions and to mold these, to the point that China is now regarded as an increasingly malign actor. Japan’s own domestic regime change, paralleling that of China, has released Revisionist forces that favor the cessation of the “underbalancing” of China. Very significantly, Japanese policy-makers’ faith is eroding in the ability to maintain defensive superiority over China, either through its own internal capabilities or the U. S. -Japan alliance. The consequence is that the evidence is now mounting of Japan shifting toward active “soft” and incipient “hard” balancing of China through a policy of the active “encirclement” of China diplomatically, the build-up of Japanese national military capabilities aimed to counter China’s <b>access</b> <b>denial</b> and power projection, and the strengthening of the U. S. -Japan alliance. This shift has become particularly evident following the 2010 trawler incident and the return to power of Prime Minister Abe Shinzō in 2012. The consequences of Japan’s shifting strategy are yet as not entirely clear. Japan may be moving toward a form of “Resentful Realism” that does not add to a new equilibrium to regional security but is actually more destabilizing and poses risk for China and the U. S., especially as Japan’s own security intentions become more opaque. In turn, these conclusions invite a reconsideration of the comfortable theoretical consensus on Japan as an eternal status quo power, and encourage Constructivism, Neoliberalism, but especially Neorealism, to be bolder in their assertions about the probability and degree of radicalism in Japan’s security trajectory...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} complexity of software, new access control methods have emerged {{to deal with}} attribute-based authorization.
