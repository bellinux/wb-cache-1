The effect of glycerol on the gelatinisation of wheat starch is studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As expected, water acted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>plasticiser</b> in that the onset temperature for gelatinisation (T 0) decreased with increasing moisture content. Glycerol, however, increased T 0. It is shown that the T 0 of starch-glycerol-water mixtures may be predicted {{on the basis of}} the effective moisture content of the starch fraction of these mixtures resulting from the relative speed of moisture absorption by glycerol and starch respectively. Moisture sorption kinetics of wheat starch and glycerol in 100 % relative humidity were determined and used to predict the preferential water absorption by glycerol in starch-glycerol-water mixtures and the resulting T 0 of the system. ...|$|E

40|$|Milling of starch {{granules}} {{is important}} for many food applications and involves a combination of mechanical and thermal energy. In {{order to understand the}} effects of mechanical force alone, four commercial starches including maize starch (MS), potato starch (PS), and two high amylose maize starches (HAMS) (Gelose 50 and Gelose 80) were cryo-milled for 20 min under the same conditions. The structural and conformational changes of the starches after cryo-milling were evaluated using X-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, IR and Raman spectroscopy, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The cryo-milled starches had less crystallinity (15 - 35 %) and 35 - 50 % less ordered structure (double and single helices) than the native starch counterparts. The gelatinisation temperatures of the starches were not significantly altered by cryo-milling, but the gelatinisation enthalpies were significantly reduced in line with the reductions in the amount of double helices. Although, all four starches showed similar extent of degradation of crystalline/ordered structure, SEC results showed a greater degradation of amylopectin molecule in MS and PS than in HAMS. Increased amylose content in starch seemed to reduce the molecular degradation during milling, which is consistent with a role for amylose <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mechanical <b>plasticiser</b> in starch granules. It is concluded that (i) cryo-milling has differential effects on molecular size and conformation depending on starch granule type, and (ii) deterioration of starch crystalline and molecular order by mechanical treatment is not necessarily linked with the reduction in molecular size. The implication from the results is that the mechanical forces acting during cryo-milling are capable of disrupting helical and crystalline structures without breaking covalent bonds of starch molecules. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A key {{trend in}} the PVC market is to replace or {{decrease}} the amount of phthalate plasticisers used due to increasing health concerns. Therefore, the demand for non-phthalate based plasticisers is growing rapidly. Mineral oils are used {{in a variety of}} rubber and polymer applications as plasticisers; however, due to the lower polarity their applicability in PVC compounds is limited. Therefore, these materials are typically used as secondary <b>plasticiser</b> along with <b>a</b> primary for the purpose of improved properties and cost reduction. Some of the non-phthalate based solutions are fast fusing plasticisers, which act like solvents and have too rapid and too high plasticizing effect. This makes the compounding difficult and could cause problems in production. These substances have good compatibility with mineral oils, and using them together in PVC compounds can help the compounding issue by reducing the solvent power and increasing the fusion time to a level where the production parameters are similar to compounding with phthalates.   The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the use of mineral oils <b>as</b> <b>a</b> secondary <b>plasticiser</b> in <b>a</b> non-phthalate system for PVC. Four different grades of mineral oil and three non-phthalate plasticisers were used in compounding and compression moulding of PVC sample films. Mechanical, physical and chemical testing were done to assess the properties in a comparative study with phthalate plasticized PVC.   Tensile testing and hardness measurements showed that the mineral oils did not contribute with any plasticizing effect for the non-phthalate plasticisers tested in the study. The hardness was instead slightly increased for all the sample films that contained mineral oil. This indicates that the mineral oil either is less efficient than the primary plasticiser or that it affects the primary plasticisers intramolecular shielding between the PVC chains.        The shrinkage test showed that the migration of mineral oil was acceptable, especially the thicker grades of mineral oils had low migration. Colour stability test showed that the thicker mineral oil grades had some problems with discolouration.

In PffBT 4 T- 2 OD/PC 71 BM devices, the power conversion efficiency increases from 7. 2 % to above 8. 7 % {{as a result of the}} coarsening of the phase domains.

40|$|The {{hardness}} of {{the outer}} regions of solid wood can be improved by surface densification, and this opens up new fields of application for low-density species. So far, surface densification relies on time- and energy-consuming batch processes, and {{this means that the}} potential advantages over more expensive hardwood species or non-renewable materials are reduced. Using fossil-based plastics or applying wood densification processes with a high energy consumption has adverse effects on the environment. In a previous study, it was shown that the surface of wood can be densified by a continuous high-speed process, adopting a roller pressing approach. The desired density profiles could be obtained at process speeds of up to 80 m min- 1, but an equally simple and fast method to eliminate the moisture-induced set-recovery of the densified wood cells is still required. For this reason, the goal {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effect on the set-recovery and hardness of surface-densified Scots pine after a fast pre-treatment with solutions of sodium silicate, sodium hydroxide, methacrylate resin, and ionic liquids. The Scots pine specimens were pre-treated by applying the chemical treatment and impregnation agents to the wood surface with a paper towel, before the specimens were densified. For each type of treatment, 15 specimens were densified in a hot press. The set-recovery was measured after two wet-dry cycles, and 30 Brinell hardness measurements were carried out on each group of specimens. In general, the effect of the treatments on the set-recovery was rather low. Ionic liquid solutions appear to work <b>as</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>plasticiser</b> and the treatment led to a reduction in set-recovery by 25 %. The treatments with sodium silicate, ionic liquids and methacrylate resin led to a greater hardness than in untreated and densified specimens.

Energetic binders {{can be considered as}} cross-linked polymers that provide a matrix to bind explosive ingredients together with <b>a</b> <b>plasticiser.</b> Once cured, the polymeric binder is a tough elastomeric rubber capable of absorbing and dissipating energy from hazardous stimuli, lending itself well to IM applications. This general document outlines the most promising energetic polymers and plasticisers being considered today. Attention is focussed on several energetic polymers including glycidyl azide polymer, GAP, poly(3 -nitratomethyl- 3 -methyloxetane), polyNIMMO and poly(glycidyl nitrate), polyGLYN, although several other energetic polymers will also be reviewed. Energetic plasticisers including oligomers (low molecular weight) of the polymers mentioned above, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> variety of nitrate esters, nitroaromatics and azido plasticisers, will also be reviewed. Finally, the review will recommend binder systems for DSTO's future energetic binder programs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} plasticisation {{effect of the}} ionic liquid, 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate ([Emim][OAc]), as {{compared}} with the traditionally used plasticiser, glycerol, on the characteristics of starch-based films. For minimising the additional effect of processing, a simple compression moulding process (which involves minimal shear) was used for preparation of starch-based films. The results show that [Emim][OAc] was favourable for plasticisation, i. e., disruption of starch granules (by scanning electron microscopy), and could result in a more amorphous structure in the starch-based materials (by X-ray diffraction and dynamic mechanical analysis). 13 C CP/MAS and SPE/MAS NMR spectroscopy revealed that not only was the crystallinity reduced by [Emim][OAc], but also the amorphous starch present was plasticised to a more mobile form as indicated by the appearance of amorphous starch in the SPE/MAS spectrum. Mechanical results illustrate that, when either glycerol or [Emim][OAc] was used, <b>a</b> higher <b>plasticiser</b> content could contribute to higher flexibility. In spite of the accelerated thermal degradation of starch by [Emim][OAc] as shown by thermogravimetric analysis, the biodegradation study revealed the antimicrobial effect of [Emim][OAc] on the starch-based materials. Considering the high-amylose starch used here which is typically difficult to gelatinise in <b>a</b> traditional <b>plasticiser</b> (water and/or glycerol), [Emim][OAc] is demonstrated to be <b>a</b> promising <b>plasticiser</b> for starch to develop "green" flexible antimicrobial materials for novel applications...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{the results of}} a series of shear tests carried out on wall panels reinforced with two techniques by means of jacketing with GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers) mesh inserted inside an inorganic matrix and a reinforced repointing of mortar joints using high strength stainless steel cords. The tests were done on panels assembled in the laboratory and were carried out using a widely-known test method (diagonal compression test). Masonry materials include stone and brick in which a variety of unit sizes and forms are produced. Mortar was a hydraulic lime/sand with <b>a</b> <b>plasticiser</b> added to improve workability. The failure loads, in-plane and out-of-plane deflections and failure modes were recorded. Based on the results of the experimental program, it appears that the in-plane shear strength of the reinforced masonry wall systems increased significantly compared with that of control unreinforced masonry panels...|$|R
