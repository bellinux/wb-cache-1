2500|$|As the Galois {{group of}} [...] is abelian, {{this is an}} <b>abelian</b> <b>extension.</b> Every {{subfield}} of a cyclotomic field is an <b>abelian</b> <b>extension</b> of the rationals. It follows that every nth root of unity may be expressed in term of k-roots, with various k not exceeding φ(n). In these cases Galois theory can be written out explicitly in terms of Gaussian periods: this theory from the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae of Gauss was published many years before Galois.|$|E
2500|$|The {{classical}} way {{to prove}} this is to construct some [...] extensions with small groups of norms, by first adding in lots of roots of unity, and then taking Kummer extensions and Artin–Schreier extensions. These extensions may be non-abelian (though they are extensions of abelian groups by abelian groups); however, this does not really matter, as the norm group of a non-abelian Galois extension {{is the same as}} that of its maximal <b>abelian</b> <b>extension</b> (this can be shown using what we already know about class fields). This gives enough (abelian) extensions to show that there is an <b>abelian</b> <b>extension</b> corresponding to any finite index subgroup of the idele class group.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} include all {{possible}} extensions having certain properties, the Galois group concept is commonly applied to the (infinite) field extension [...] / F of the algebraic closure, leading to the absolute Galois group G := Gal( [...] / F) or just Gal(F), and to the extension F / Q. The fundamental theorem of Galois theory links fields in between F and its algebraic closure and closed subgroups of Gal (F). For example, the abelianization (the biggest abelian quotient) Gab of G corresponds to a field {{referred to as the}} maximal <b>abelian</b> <b>extension</b> Fab (called so since any further extension is not abelian, i.e., does not have an abelian Galois group). By the Kronecker–Weber theorem, the maximal <b>abelian</b> <b>extension</b> of Q is the extension generated by all roots of unity. For more general number fields, class field theory, specifically the Artin reciprocity law gives an answer by describing Gab in terms of the idele class group. Also notable is the Hilbert class field, the maximal abelian unramified field extension of F. It can be shown to be finite over F, its Galois group over F is isomorphic to the class group of F, in particular its degree equals the class number h of F (see above).|$|E

Bernstein’s article appeared in 1904, almost 20 years before Artin conjectured his version of the reciprocity law, and seems to have been overlooked completely.
