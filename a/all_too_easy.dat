25|$|Gerry Anderson {{began his}} career in photography, earning a {{traineeship}} with the British Colonial Film Unit after the war. He developed an interest in film editing {{and moved on to}} Gainsborough Pictures, where he gained further experience. In 1947 he was conscripted for national service with the Royal Air Force. He was based at RAF Manston, an airfield near Margate, and served part of his time in air traffic control. On one occasion, a Spitfire was coming in to land. It was only about 50 feet above the ground before the runway controller alerted the pilot to the fact the plane's undercarriage hadn't lowered. The pilot opened up the throttle and climbed away. As this was a moment Anderson always remembered, he found it <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> to write about aircraft when he devised stories for Thunderbirds. After completing his military service, he returned to Gainsborough, where he worked until the studio was closed in 1950. He then worked freelance on a series of feature films.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Scalia vociferously {{opposed the}} idea of a living constitution, or the power of the {{judiciary}} to modify the meaning of constitutional provisions to adapt them to changing times. Scalia warned that if one accepted that constitutional standards should evolve with a maturing society, [...] "the risk of assessing evolving standards is that it is <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> to believe that evolution has culminated in one's own views". He compared the Constitution to statutes he contended were not understood to change their meaning through time.|$|E
500|$|Political {{independence}} {{was not necessarily}} the foreordained outcome of the political turmoil in Spanish America. [...] "There was little interest in outright independence." [...] As historians R.A. Humphreys and John Lynch note, [...] "it is <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> to equate the forces of discontent or even the forces of change with the forces of revolution." [...] Since [...] "by definition, there was no history of independence until it happened," [...] because Spanish American independence did occur, explanations for why it came about have been sought.|$|E

[...] "I {{mean that}} men don't, {{when it has}} <b>all</b> been <b>too</b> <b>easy.</b> That's how, in nine cases out of ten, a woman is treated who has risked her life. You asked me just now how he works," [...] she added; [...] "but you might better perhaps have asked me how he plays." ...|$|R
5000|$|In her memoir, Cornell states: [...] "I {{do think}} that the rapid success {{achieved}} by some people in pictures has seriously hurt the chances of a lot of {{young men and women who}} are studying for the stage. The success stories that we read in the Hollywood magazines make it <b>all</b> sound <b>too</b> <b>easy.</b> A youngster was a chauffeur yesterday and today he owns four swimming pools! It doesn't work that way on the stage... Some young actresses haven't been inclined to listen to me when I told that there was no royal road to success on the stage.|$|R
500|$|Negative {{opinions}} about the album stemmed from its lyrical content. Some critics {{have said that the}} serious nature of the lyrics are hard to digest. Others said Dreyer's lyrics and vocals still overshadow the instrumentation. Alex Andrews of Thrash Hits gave the album a four out of six rating, saying: [...] "The flipside of Dreyer's imposing presence is that it can be <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> to let the rest of the band fade into the background. It's a shame, because for the most part, there are some interesting things happening".|$|E
500|$|Sylvia Anderson {{suggested}} that American audiences, who were less {{familiar with the}} Supermarionation productions of Century 21, were more enthusiastic. She explained, [...] "It was <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> to compare our real actors with our puppet characters and descriptions such as 'wooden', 'expressionless', 'no strings attached' and 'puppet-like' were cheap shots some of the UK critics could not resist... Typecasting is the lazy man's friend, and boy, were we typecast in Britain." [...] On Doppelgänger, she said in 1992, [...] "I saw it on TV {{a couple of years}} ago and I was very pleased with it. I thought it came over quite well." ...|$|E
500|$|Neva Chonin of the San Francisco Chronicle {{believed}} the show [...] "was pure Britney excess, [...] hugely entertaining" [...] {{and added that}} [...] "while it's <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> to deride Spears' contrivances from a distance, in person there's no denying her charisma or her archetypal appeal. She's like a refugee from David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, a gleaming dream cipher waiting {{to be filled with}} an audience's fantasies. And she works that role with flawless professionalism, punctuating her choreographed moves with an amiable accessibility that drew fans into her airtight world even as it kept them at a safe distance. In short, she connected—through smiles, giggles and what seemed to be genuine pleasure in performing." [...] While reviewing the Femme Fatale Tour in 2011, Jim Harrington of the Oakland Tribune deemed the show as [...] "one of the best pop music productions I’ve ever witnessed." ...|$|E
5000|$|In The Guinness Book of Decisive Battles, the British {{historian}} Geoffrey Regan {{argues that}} the victory bolstered Japan's increasingly aggressive political and military establishment. According to Regan, the lopsided Japanese victory at Tsushima:...created a legend that was to haunt Japan's leaders for forty years. A British admiral once said, 'It takes three years to build a ship, but 300 years to build a tradition.' Japan thought that the victory had completed this task {{in a matter of}} a few years ... It had <b>all</b> been <b>too</b> <b>easy.</b> Looking at Tōgō's victory over one of the world's great powers convinced some Japanese military men that with more ships, and bigger and better ones, similar victories could be won throughout the Pacific. Perhaps no power could resist the Japanese navy, not even Britain and the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fourth and}} final Vandread to appear, and {{by far the most}} powerful. It is the fusion of Dita's, Meia's, and Jura's Dreads; Hibiki's Vanguard; and Pyoro (which prompts him to christen the fusion [...] "Vandread Pyoro"). The overall power of this machine is unknown, however, {{it can be said that}} the Super Vandread {{incorporates}} all three Vandread types into its design: with a wave of its hand, the Super Vandread can erect a shield strong enough to absorb any enemy fire (Jura-type); the discs scattered around its frame can form to fire an extremely powerful laser (Jura-type, Dita-type); a large energy sword, created from the hands, easily slices any Harvester unit (Dita-type); it still maintains significant speed for a combined machine (Meia-type). It is the least used of the Vandreads, which for overall plot reasons is simply because it would make nearly <b>all</b> battles <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> (in its debut it easily destroyed a copy of the Nirvana and a Harvest Flagship). The only time it met an enemy that could challenge it was in the form of world destroying harvest ship.|$|R
500|$|Multiple reviewers {{found the}} pack-in six-game {{cartridge}} games subpar and repetitive. Mean Machines Gus {{wrote that the}} games were <b>all</b> <b>too</b> simple and <b>easy.</b> Of the pack, reviewers held Ready, Aim, Tomatoes! in the highest regard. Ray Barnholt of 1UP.com wrote that the Menacer's games were [...] "duller" [...] than its competitor Super Scope's already dull games, but Tomatoes! gave Sega's cartridge [...] "some pittance of value". Mega rated the ToeJam & Earl spin-off at 62%, calling it [...] "fun and strange" [...] though [...] "rather repetitive". Sega Force thought the game's graphics were the pack's best, and its audio to be of high quality, though the magazine also considered the game repetitive. GamePro thought the game's colors were oversaturated.|$|R
2500|$|Sperry's first book, One Day with Manu, a colorfully {{illustrated}} tale {{of everyday}} life in Bora Bora, appeared in 1933. Critic Joan McGrath, cautions modern readers to take his depictions of other cultures in context, stating, [...] "His early work, such as the tales of Manu, Jambi, and Tuktu, {{are unlikely to be}} found in library collections of today, in an era rendered more sensitive to the feelings of minority cultures and racial pride than in the 1930s. Coloured as they were by the prevailing attitudes of his day, Sperry's ethnological works for young readers would by critics of today be stigmatized as condescending in their approach: it is <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> to lose the historical perspective that would credit him with enlightenment and objectivity, given their date of publication." ...|$|E
2500|$|Using the two-man {{combination}}. The 2-man combination pass, variously {{called the}} wall pass, the [...] "one-two", the [...] "give and go" [...] {{and other local}} names, is among the simplest yet most powerful team techniques in football. It requires a fair level of individual skill to pull off, yet this should not stop coaches from introducing it early in the higher youth leagues, nor should players from these leagues neglect it in favour of the <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> [...] "kick and chase". There {{are two ways to}} execute it: (a) pass and run to space for the return pass without pausing or (b) pass then pause briefly to gauge opposing reaction before running into an open spot for the return. In tight conditions, the first method is better, while the second can be used where there is a bit more space to operate.|$|E
2500|$|Kienzle is {{credited}} with naming [...] "Templton's Crossing" [...] in memory of Templeton, who was killed during the fighting around Kokoda. [...] In a contemporaneous newspaper article, he was described as [...] "the man who blazed the Kokoda Trail". [...] In an article appearing {{at the time of}} the 25th anniversary commemorations, he was described as: [...] "a key man in the jungle campaign". Author, Peter Fitzsimons observed that: [...] "Kienzle's facility with the natives was crucial because they were indeed particular and they would provide the key manpower" [...] for the campaign. [...] Author, Peter Brune, having already made a dedication to the contribution of Kienzle in naming a chapter of his book [...] "Bert and the Doc", went on to say: [...] "We have seen the enormous contribution of Bert Kienzle. [...] It is <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> to isolate his effort in one chapter. [...] His contribution was ongoing and insistent". Karl James said of Kienzle: [...] " [...] was one of the outstanding Australian personalities of the campaign." [...] He goes on to reiterate the sentiment of fellow historian, Alan Powell, who considered that, [...] "no man on the Kokoda Track did more to ensure the Australian victory than Kienzle." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Times of India panned the film, {{giving it}} 1 1/2 stars and stating [...] "There is no {{emotional}} {{conflict in the}} story that provokes you to think or get inspired. Situations are written to convenience the protagonists' quest for revenge. And they get it way <b>too</b> <b>easy.</b> The shallow treatment doesn't {{live up to the}} topic addressed."Business Insider criticized the film as missing the [...] "emotional pain and conflict" [...] that similarly themed films such as Adalat o Ekti Meye possessed, commenting that they felt W was a [...] "stereotype revenge drama that worked out <b>all</b> <b>too</b> smoothly".|$|R
2500|$|Caesar himself felt, [...] "It had <b>all</b> come <b>too</b> fast, was <b>too</b> <b>easy,</b> and he didn't {{deserve the}} acclaim." [...] Writer Mel Brooks, who also became his close friend, said, [...] "I {{know of no}} other comedian, {{including}} Chaplin, who could have done nearly ten years of live television. Nobody's talent was ever more used up than Sid's. He {{was one of the}} greatest artists ever born. But over a period of years, television ground him into sausages." ...|$|R

2500|$|Information {{theory was}} a fashionable {{scientific}} {{approach in the}} mid '50s. However, pioneer Claude Shannon wrote in 1956 that this trendiness was dangerous. He said, [...] "Our fellow scientists in many different fields, attracted by the fanfare and by the new avenues opened to scientific analysis, are using these ideas in their own problems...It will be <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> for our somewhat artificial prosperity to collapse overnight when it is realized {{that the use of}} a few exciting words like information, entropy, redundancy, do not solve all our problems." [...] During the next decade, a combination of factors shut down the application of information theory to natural language processing (NLP) problemsin particular machine translation. One factor was the 1957 publication of Noam Chomsky's Syntactic Structures, which stated, [...] "probabilistic models give no insight into the basic problems of syntactic structure". This accorded well with the philosophy of the artificial intelligence research of the time, which promoted rule-based approaches. The other factor was the 1966 ALPAC report, which recommended that the government should stop funding research into machine translation. ALPAC chairman John Pierce later said that the field was filled with [...] "mad inventors or untrustworthy engineers". He said that the underlying linguistic problems must be solved before attempts at NLP could be reasonably made. These elements essentially halted research in the field.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 a {{class action}} lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user {{messages}} for web links, translating them to “likes” on the user’s Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for targeted advertising, the plaintiffs claimed. [...] "Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA {{also referred to as}} the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code," [...] the plaintiffs said. This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private. [...] It is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it is out in the open. [...] This is becoming a bigger issue now that so much of society interacts online which was not the case fifteen years ago. [...] In addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, people's interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and {{it is important to consider}} that when interacting online. [...] New forms of social networking and digital media such as Instagram and Snapchat may call for new guidelines regarding privacy. [...] What makes this difficult is the wide range of opinions surrounding the topic, so it is left mainly up to our judgement to respect other people's online privacy in some circumstances. [...] Sometimes it may be necessary to take extra precautions in situations where somebody else may have a tighter view on privacy ethics. [...] No matter the situation it is beneficial to know about the potential consequences and issues that can come from careless activity on social networks.|$|E

With an abundance of convincing instances Professor Metchnikoff demonstrates that life is a system of [...] "disharmonies," [...] capable of no perfect way, that there is no [...] "perfect" [...] dieting, no [...] "perfect" [...] sexual life, no [...] "perfect" [...] happiness, no [...] "perfect" [...] conduct. He releases one from the arbitrary but <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> assumption that there is even an ideal [...] "perfection" [...] in organic life.

Burton, however, decided upon a few days' rest. Not that the work was any trouble to him; on the contrary it was <b>all</b> <b>too</b> ridiculously <b>easy.</b> It seemed to him the most amazing thing that a description in plain words of what any one might stand and look at, should be called literature. And yet some times, in his more thoughtful moments, he dimly understood. He remembered that between him and the multitudes of his fellow-creatures there was a difference. Everything he saw, he saw through the clear white light. There were no mists to cloud his vision, there was no halo of idealism hovering around the objects upon which his eyes rested. It was the truth he saw, and nothing beyond it. He compared his own work with work of a similar character written by well-known men, and his understanding became more complete. He found in their work a touch of personality, a shade of self-consciousness about the description of even the most ordinary things. The individuality of the writer and his subject were always blended. In his own work, subject alone counted. He had never learned any of the tricks of writing. His prose consisted of the simple use of simple words. His mind was empty of all inheritance of acquired knowledge. He had no preconceived ideals, towards the realizations of which he should bend the things he saw. He was simply a prophet of absolute truth. If he had found in those days a literary godfather, he would, without doubt, have been presented to the world as a genius.|$|R
