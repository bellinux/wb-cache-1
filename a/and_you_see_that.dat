The leap from there was that cure from The Last Stand didn't work exactly the way they thought it would, and so we just leaped forward however many years, and he's got his powers back." ...|$|E
500|$|The dragons {{featured}} in the episode's finale were implemented by Bluebolt, UK, the lead VFX agency for the first season. VFX supervisor Angela Barson confirmed that the CGI dragons {{were among the most}} stressful effects, prompting sleepless nights. Commenting on the episode's climactic scene where the hatchling dragons are revealed, actress Emilia Clarke told VH1, [...] "You see the relationship that Dany has with her eggs, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> grow and grow and grow and kind of the intuitive connection she has with them, you see that develop really beautifully." [...] Clarke also hinted that she expected to [...] "get to play with some more dragons!" [...] in the second season, based on her conversations with book author and executive producer George R.R. Martin. [...] "VFX Data Wrangler" [...] Naill McEvoy has confirmed that dragon presence will be increasing in season two.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO following the airing of the episode, David Benioff {{spoke about the}} revelation in King's Landing, and Tommen's decision to abolish [...] "trial by combat," [...] stating [...] "This moment is a grievous blow for Cersei because she's been counting on trial by combat really {{since the end of}} season five. This was always her ace in the hole, the Mountain was never going to lose a trial by combat there's no one out there who could beat him. And then Tommen takes it away from her and knowing really what he's doing. He might be a weak King, but he's not an idiot, he understands that this move is going to mean that she's probably not going to fare that well in this trial. So it's a pretty devastating moment for Cersei, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> in her reaction, and partly because it just bodes so ill for this coming trial, and partly because it's her own son who's really betrayed her." ...|$|E

2500|$|There is no human-rights {{organization}} or anti-corruption group in Equatorial Guinea. The human-rights group EG Justice, {{which focuses on}} such issues in the country, is based abroad. Its executive director, Tutu Alicante, has lived in U.S. exile since age 19 and describes his country has having two realities. [...] "It has the highest GDP per capita but also the widest {{gap between rich and}} poor people." [...] Despite being [...] "on paper the richest country on the continent on a per capita basis, on a par with many European nations," [...] he told The Guardian in 2014, Equatorial Guinea has [...] "one of the highest income and standard of living disparities....The income per capita is one which should allow people to have the same access to healthcare etc. as most European nations. Then you look at the rates of access to water, access to adequate healthcare, access to education, infant mortality, maternal mortality, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> we are basically where the DRC is, where Haiti is. The gap between the income and the access to basic needs and rights is astronomical." [...] The reason for the absence of human-rights or anti-corruption groups, he has explained, is that the country is small, and any institution, such as a church, [...] "that the government perceives as sufficiently powerful is immediately co-opted" [...] or [...] "completely undermined." [...] Also, there are no labor unions, and any meeting of over five people requires a government permit.|$|E

"Wopper," [...] {{repeated}} the Professor, [...] "the glacier des Bossons, {{like all the}} other glaciers, seems to remain immovable, though in reality it flows-- ever flows--downward; but its motion is so slow, that it is not perceptible to the naked eye.
