25|$|Before the 19th century, {{divergent}} series were widely used by Leonhard Euler and others, but often led to confusing and contradictory results. A major problem was Euler's idea that any {{divergent series}} {{should have a}} natural sum, without first defining {{what is meant by}} the sum of a divergent series. Augustin-Louis Cauchy eventually gave a rigorous definition of the sum of a (convergent) series, and for some time after this, divergent series were mostly excluded from mathematics. They reappeared in 1886 with Henri Poincaré's work on <b>asymptotic</b> <b>series.</b> In 1890, Ernesto Cesàro realized that one could give a rigorous definition of the sum of some divergent series, and defined Cesàro summation. (This was not the first use of Cesàro summation, which was used implicitly by Ferdinand Georg Frobenius in 1880; Cesàro's key contribution was not the discovery of this method, but his idea that one should give an explicit definition of the sum of a divergent series.) In the years after Cesàro's paper, several other mathematicians gave other definitions of the sum of a divergent series, although these are not always compatible: different definitions can give different answers for the sum of the same divergent series; so, when talking about the sum of a divergent series, it is necessary to specify which summation method one is using.|$|E

The basic argument goes as follows: if the coupling constant were negative, this would be equivalent to the Coulomb force constant being negative.

This would render the vacuum unstable against decay into a cluster of electrons {{on one side of}} the universe and a cluster of positrons on the other side of the universe.

The first terms in the <b>asymptotic</b> power <b>series</b> of the far field valid on the axis, on the shadow boundary, in the shadow, and in the geometrical illuminated region off axis are obtained to show how they change discontinuously as the field point passes from one region to another.
