However the Rhondda did produce the suffragette and social reformer Elizabeth Andrews, one of only nine women among a list of a hundred greatest Welsh heroes chosen by ballot in 2004.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} centuries BCE, {{the worship of}} Isis spread from Egypt across the Mediterranean world, and she {{became one of the}} most popular deities in the region. Although this new, {{multicultural}} form of Isis absorbed characteristics from many other deities, her original mythological nature as <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> was key to her appeal. Horus and Osiris, being central figures in her story, spread along with her. The Greek and Roman cult of Isis developed a series of initiation rites dedicated to Isis and Osiris, based on earlier Greco-Roman mystery rites but colored by Egyptian afterlife beliefs. The initiate went through an experience that simulated descent into the underworld. Elements of this ritual resemble Osiris's merging with the sun in Egyptian funerary texts. Isis's Greek and Roman devotees, like the Egyptians, believed that she protected the dead in the afterlife as she had done for Osiris, and they said that undergoing the initiation guaranteed to them a blessed afterlife. It was to a Greek priestess of Isis that Plutarch wrote his account of the myth of Osiris.|$|E

Her mother and mother- in-law confirmed to reporters that the rumors were true. As being <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> were clear violations of the contest rules, Gage was immediately disqualified and stripped of her Miss USA crown.|$|E

25|$|In the burghs {{there were}} {{probably}} high proportions of poor households headed by widows, who survived on casual earnings and the profits from selling foodstuffs or ale. Spinning was an expected part of the daily work of Medieval townswomen of all social classes. In crafts, women could sometimes be apprentices, {{but they could not}} join guilds in their own right. Scotland was relatively poorly supplied with nunneries, but prioresses were figures with considerable authority. There may have been small numbers of anchorites. The Virgin Mary, as the epitome of <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother,</b> was probably an important model for women.

25|$|In rural Amhara in 2003/04, {{there were}} strong social and {{cultural}} pressures for girls to marry before they were 14 years old. Virginity before marriage was highly valued and an unmarried girl over 14 year was stigmatized. She was an embarrassment to herself and her family and regarded as a financial burden since her contribution to domestic and agricultural activities was not valued. The age of first marriage had been declining since the mothers' average age of marriage was 11 years while their daughters' average age of marriage was 8 years. Early marriage allowed formation of bonds between families and, when families were land rich, it maintained their land holdings. Sons from land poor families, who had {{reached the age of}} 18, could obtain land from the peasants association if they married. There was no need for brides to be 18 and they were often under 11 years old. Boys, but not girls, were expected to be successful at the local school. Success for a girl was as <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> and early marriage provided recognition in the community.|$|E
25|$|Scotland was {{relatively}} poorly supplied with nunneries, with 30 identified {{for the period}} to 1300, compared with 150 for England, and very few in the Highlands. Prioresses like Anna MacLean (d. 1543) of Iona Nunnery, were figures with considerable authority: appointing lay officers, managing lands and finances {{as well as the}} lives of the nuns under them. There may have been small numbers of anchorites, who isolated themselves from society and devoted themselves to God, but they have left very few traces in the records. The Virgin Mary, as the epitome of <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother,</b> was probably an important model for women. There is evidence from late Medieval burghs like Perth, of women, usually wives, acting through relatives and husbands as benefactors or property owners connected with local altars and cults of devotion. In Perth there were several altars devoted to aspects of Marian worship in the Parish church of St. John, a chapel dedicated to St. Anne, the mother of Mary, or Lady's Chapel and the Loreto Chapel, dedicated to the Virgin's Holy House. Around the town several monasteries were also dedicated to the Virgin. Queen Margaret became important after her canonisation in 1250 and after the ceremonial transfer of her remains to Dunfermline Abbey, {{as one of the most}} revered national saints. New cults of devotion connected with Jesus and the Virgin Mary began to reach Scotland in the fifteenth century, including the Five Wounds, the Holy Blood and the Holy Name of Jesus. There were also new religious feasts, including celebrations of the Presentation, the Visitation and Mary of the Snows.|$|E

25|$|In 1955, Ganpal Lal Batto died {{suddenly}} in a road accident. His death left Shamshad very distraught, {{because her husband}} had been the focus of her life and they had both been extremely devoted to each other. He had handled many aspects of her career and contracts and had been a major positive energy behind her career progression. After his death, Shamshad became listless and lost the fighting spirit to pursue her career, which registered a sharp decline thereafter. Indeed, while Shamshad Begum was both an outstanding singer and a successful famous one, she was at some deeper level always <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> first, someone who instinctively prioritised her family over her career. By nature, she preferred to keep away from the public glare and from business dealings, taking the view that it was rather unseemly for a lady to be involved in such things. After her husband's death, Shamshad Begum began living with her daughter and son-in-law in Mumbai, first in south Mumbai and later at Hiranandani Gardens in the Powai neighbourhood. She gradually became a recluse and devoted herself entirely to her grandchildren, {{to the point that the}} general public was unaware of whether she was alive or dead. In 2004, a controversy erupted in the media, when several publications wrongly reported that Shamshad Begum had died a few years previously. Shamshad's family clarified in a press release that this was not so; and it later emerged that the Shamshad Begum who had died in 1998 was Saira Banu's maternal grandmother. Her self-imposed seclusion is remarkable, because during all those decades away from the public eye, her old songs remained popular with the public and not a day passed without at least a couple of songs being played on Vividh Bharati and All India Radio.|$|E
500|$|Shabazz {{began to}} accept {{speaking}} engagements at colleges and universities.

[...] "They attempted to promote him as a violent person, a hater of whites," [...] she explained. [...] "He was a sensitive man, a very understanding person and yes, he disliked the behavior of some whites.... He had a reality-based agenda." ...|$|E
500|$|Voyager creator Jeri Taylor {{designed}} Janeway Lambda one as Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew's) favorite holonovel and a [...] "story {{within a}} story" [...] that would slowly unravel {{with each of}} its appearances. It was the first holonovel to be featured in the series. Taylor originally imagined the program as a simulation of Western fiction, in which Janeway {{assumed the role of}} a pioneer emigrating to the American West on a covered wagon. Janeway's character was described as <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> struggling with daily tasks, and was portrayed as the polar opposite of Janeway's position as a Starfleet Captain. Taylor described the Western concept as a [...] "metaphor for the captain's predicament in the Delta Quadrant" [...] and a [...] "method of developing and enhancing Janeway's character". The plan was subsequently abandoned after Mulgrew expressed a dislike for working with horses and estimates for developing and filming each scene ranged up to an additional $100,000 per day. Taylor said it was [...] "not a prudent decision" [...] to keep the Western concept considering the show's budget and the difficulty in shooting outdoor locations. As a result, the concept of Janeway Lambda one was changed to be a work of Gothic fiction set in 1840s England.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Marc Cherry {{was in a}} {{precarious}} financial situation and was having trouble finding a job. He commented, [...] "I was broke, unable to get even an interview for a writing job, and seriously concerned about my future. I had just turned forty and was starting to wonder if I {{was one of those}} deluded writers that wander around Hollywood, convincing themselves they're talented when all the evidence points to the contrary." [...] While watching television coverage of the Andrea Yates trials with his mother, Cherry turned to her and asked, [...] "Can you imagine being so desperate that you would do that to your children?" [...] to which his mother replied, [...] "I've been there." [...] Cherry was intrigued by the idea that a [...] "perfectly sane, rational woman could have the life she wanted, being <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother...</b> and still have moments of insanity;" [...] he began writing the pilot episode soon after. Cherry originally developed the concept as a half-hour comedy. However, after his agent was arrested for embezzlement, Cherry signed with Paradigm Talent Agency, where he was advised to rewrite the script as a soap opera. Cherry completed the first draft of the pilot in April 2002 and pitched the script to CBS, NBC, Fox, HBO, Showtime, and Lifetime, all of which turned it down.|$|E

Katherine encouraged her daughter to proceed with the union; she felt that being <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> were important roles for all of her daughters to play. Joseph, however, was against the marriage; he wanted Rebbie to {{follow in the footsteps of}} her brothers (The Jackson 5) and become a singer. Her father felt that married life would stop her from becoming a success in the entertainment business. Though Rebbie had taken clarinet, piano, and dance lessons in her childhood, she had no interest in a music career. This was despite the fact that, according to brother Jermaine, she had won several singing contests, duetting with brother Jackie. The teenager thought a happy home was more comforting and secure than the instability of show business. She also wanted to leave her family's drama-filled home on Jackson Street as well as get away from her controlling father. Arguments ensued for several weeks before her father relented and allowed Rebbie to wed Brown. Having the last word on the matter, Joseph refused to walk his daughter down the aisle.|$|E

500|$|Medieval Scotland was {{a patriarchal}} society, where {{authority}} was invested {{in men and}} women had a very limited legal status. How exactly patriarchy worked in practice is difficult to discern. Women could marry {{from the age of}} 12 (while for boys it was from 14) and, while many girls from the social elite married in their teens, {{by the end of the}} period most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties. The extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, although there was no divorce as such. Separation from bed and board was allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery. In the burghs there were probably high proportions of poor households headed by widows, who survived on casual earnings and the profits from selling foodstuffs or ale. Spinning was an expected part of the daily work of Medieval townswomen of all social classes. In crafts, women could sometimes be apprentices, but they could not join guilds in their own right. Some women worked and traded independently, hiring and training employees, which may have made them attractive as marriage partners. Scotland was relatively poorly supplied with nunneries, with 30 identified for the period to 1300, compared with 150 for England, and very few in the Highlands. The Virgin Mary, as the epitome of <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> was probably an important model for women. There is evidence from late Medieval burghs like Perth, of women, usually wives, acting through relatives and husbands as benefactors or property owners connected with local altars and cults of devotion.
