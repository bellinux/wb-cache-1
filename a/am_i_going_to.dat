500|$|Quatermass 2 {{received}} mixed reviews. Campbell Dixon in The Daily Telegraph {{found the}} film “all good grisly fun, {{if this is}} the sort of thing you enjoy”. The reviewer in The Times remarked that “the writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally”. On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the London Evening News wrote: “Science-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. Quatermass II [...] fails on all these scores, I am afraid”. Similarly, the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt “The whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue.

Show writer and storyboard artist Vincent Waller said: Squidward is hard to drawhe has a very odd-shaped head. Fortunately, his emotions are pretty even, but to get {{a whole lot of}} big emoting out of him is a challenge. His nose splits everything in half, so it's always like, 'OK, how <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work this and still make it read?' Hillenburg thought of making jokes with Squidward ejecting ink but retired it because, according to him, [...] "it always looks like he's pooping his pants".

500|$|According to folk {{tradition}} Marko never died; he {{lives on in}} a cave, in a moss-covered den or in an unknown land. A Serbian legend recounts that Marko once fought a battle in which so many men were killed that the soldiers (and their horses) swam in blood. He lifted his hands towards heaven and said, [...] "Oh God, what <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do now?" [...] God took pity on Marko, transporting him and Šarac to a cave (where Marko stuck his sabre into a rock and fell asleep). There is moss in the cave; Šarac eats it bit by bit, while the sabre slowly emerges from the rock. When it falls {{on the ground and}} Šarac finishes the moss, Marko will awaken and reenter the world. Some allegedly saw him after descending into a deep pit, where he lived in a large house in front of which Šarac was seen. Others saw him in a faraway land, living in a cave. According to Macedonian tradition Marko drank [...] "eagle's water", which made him immortal; he is with Elijah in heaven.|$|E
500|$|The writers for {{the season}} worked in Los Angeles, with {{one member of the}} writing team on set in New York for filming. Actress Carrie-Anne Moss talked about how the scripts {{developed}} through the production of the season, explaining that the dialogue usually did not change much while filming, but scenes were altered to accommodate the filming locations when necessary. Rosenberg stated that, since Jones is a private investigator, there would be some procedural elements to the show, [...] "but that’s not our focus. There are cases. In particular, there is a large case that carries over the season." [...] Elaborating on this, Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb said that the [...] "fun about being a private detective is that the line between what’s legal and what’s not legal gets very blurred....her drive is not always necessarily to solve the case, {{as much as it is}} to go, 'Okay, can I pay the rent?

[...] He noted that this would not be as much of an issue if characters were making very minor cameo appearances, but explained that Marvel was not interested in cameos and easter eggs just for the sake of fan service, which could detract from the story being told; [...] "As I often get reported by you folks for saying #ItsAllConnected, our feeling is that the connection isn't just whether or not somebody is walking into a movie or walking out of a television show. It's connected in the way that the shows come from the same place, that they are real, that they are grounded."

Japanese Cartoon was influenced by a variety of musical genres, with Fiasco saying, [...] "I've always been a fan of all music...Hip hop is just something I actually know how to do but I always had aspirations to participate in other forms of music. Once I got to create some hip hop, it was like, 'Okay, what <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do now?' So my artistic side was like, 'Yo, let's do some rock music.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Originally {{entitled}} [...] "For Evermore", [...] "Evermore" [...] {{was written}} by composer Menken and lyricist Rice. The last of the three original songs written for the remake, [...] "Evermore" [...] was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own. Written in Spring 2015 in London, England, Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle. Actor Dan Stevens, who portrays the Beast and performs [...] "Evermore", had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film. Before [...] "Evermore" [...] was written, Condon informed Stevens {{that he would be}} singing a new song in his role as Beast. Having not sung professionally since childhood, Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice, the process of which he found challenging. To prepare for the recording, Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann-Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken. Stevens first recorded a [...] "guide track" [...] for [...] "Evermore" [...] before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes. To make the actor sound more [...] "beast-like", sound engineers digitally modified Stevens' voice, which Menken produced himself. Auto-Tune was used to make Stevens' voice sound lower and heavier. Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production. On recording a new song, Stevens said, [...] "the pressure's sort of off — but it's also on — because it doesn't have to sound like it did before, but it should sound good enough to sit alongside the music that's already pretty great." [...] Stevens agreed that the song is [...] "a big, romantic, soaring number" [...] about the Beast lamenting [...] "I've fallen in love with her, and now she's buggered off, woe is me", while [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] is [...] "How <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fall in love with her?" [...] Replacing [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] with [...] "Evermore" [...] helped make the songwriters eligible for an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.|$|E
