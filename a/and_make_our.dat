500|$|Franck's text shows {{elements}} of early Pietism: {{the expression of}} extreme feelings, for example [...] "O seligste Zeiten!" [...] (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a [...] "mystical demeanour", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to [...] "" [...] (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His [...] temple, more literally: [...] "God wants to prepare [...] souls to become his temples"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, [...] "" [...] (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>Our</b> dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that {{was present at the}} Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn [...] "", which is based on the Latin hymn [...] "Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium". Movement 6 is a chorale, verse four of Philipp Nicolai's hymn [...] "". Nicolai's [...] "Geistlich Brautlied" [...] (Spiritual bridal song) continues the theme of unity between Soul and Spirit.|$|E

NASCAR sanctions required {{the use of a}} carburetor restrictor plate for races held at the track. In 2000, the year before Earnhardt died, NASCAR instituted additional restrictions to the springs and shocks used on the cars, causing Earnhardt to complain to the media, [...] "The rules took NASCAR [...] Winston Cup racing and made it some of the sorriest racing. They took racing {{out of the hands of}} the drivers and the crews. We can't adjust <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>our</b> cars drive like we want. They just killed the racing at Daytona.

2500|$|In June 2011, {{the band}} moved to Marfa, Texas to begin {{recording}} their fourth studio album, with bassist and multi-instrumentalist Chris Taylor {{returning to his}} role as producer. Droste noted, [...] "We had passed through before {{and there is a}} great arts collective and vibe. We decided to rent a place <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>our</b> next album there." [...] The band recorded [...] "an album's worth of material" [...] in Marfa, but ultimately abandoned the majority of tracks. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, [...] "We were like, 'We're ready to do this!' Then, we got there and recorded twelve songs and were like, 'This isn't quite there.'" [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen elaborated, [...] "We didn't have that unspoken momentum, that unspoken understanding of what everyone is into." [...] Only two songs from these sessions made it onto the finished album; [...] "Sleeping Ute" [...] and [...] "Yet Again".|$|E
2500|$|Improving the {{conditions}} of the streets of London is not just a question of how to prevent crime or to apprehend robbers, Moreton actually recognises how the architectonic structure of roads, lanes, and avenues might make a difference, otherwise [...] "all by-turnings, courts, alleys, lanes, , which may favour a street-robber's escape, <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>our</b> project ineffectual". London criminals had endless opportunities to escape from a pursuer, and as Henry Fielding wrote in 1751 in his essay An Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers: Whoever indeed considers the Cities of London and Westminster, with the late vast Addition of their Suburbs; the great irregularity of their Buildings, the immense Number of Lanes, Alleys, Courts and Bye-places; must think, that, had they intended for the very purpose of Concealment, they could scarce have been contrived. Upon such a view, the whole appears as a vast Wood or Forest, in which a Thief may harbour with as great Security, as wild Beasts do in the Deserts of Africa or Arabia. And indeed, as we also learn from Defoe's fictions, if you knew where to look the city might offer unexpectedly comfortable corners.|$|E
