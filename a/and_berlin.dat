5|$|Along {{this route}} between New Haven and Hartford, the Hartford and New Haven Turnpike was {{chartered}} in 1798 and opened in 1799, beginning at Grove Street in New Haven and leaving on Whitney Avenue, passing via Meriden <b>and</b> <b>Berlin,</b> and entering Hartford on Maple Avenue. This {{was one of}} the first turnpikes to be built on a straight line rather than along existing roads.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, home matches {{were mostly}} played in smaller towns with no {{professional}} football clubs. As the team became more successful, {{especially after the}} World Cup win in 2003, the number of spectators rose accordingly. Today, the team usually plays in stadiums with 10,000 to 25,000 seats. The ten largest German cities have only hosted five international matches. The team have played twice in Frankfurt <b>and</b> <b>Berlin,</b> and once Hamburg. Bremen, Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Essen, Cologne, Munich and Stuttgart have never hosted an international match of the women's team.|$|E

5|$|Meyerbeer took {{particular}} care {{over the}} first London <b>and</b> <b>Berlin</b> productions. He travelled to London to check the singers and production for the original version, and requested that the German translation for Berlin be undertaken by the poet Ludwig Rellstab, strongly recommending that Taglioni and her father Fillipo be re-engaged, and that Ciceri's sets should be reproduced. Although Taglioni danced and the sets were retained, the translation was eventually carried out by Meyerbeer's friend Theodor Hell. Meyerbeer wrote additional ballet music for Taglioni for the Berlin production.|$|E

5|$|The work of Krafft-Ebing and Ellis {{was widely}} read, {{and helped to}} create public {{consciousness}} of female homosexuality. The sexologists' claims that homosexuality was a congenital anomaly were generally well-accepted by homosexual men; it indicated that their behavior was not inspired by nor {{should be considered a}} criminal vice, as was widely acknowledged. In the absence of any other material to describe their emotions, homosexuals accepted the designation of different or perverted, and used their outlaw status to form social circles in Paris <b>and</b> <b>Berlin.</b> Lesbian began to describe elements of a subculture.|$|E
5|$|Three of the {{surviving}} ships, Lübeck, München, and Danzig, were seized by Britain as war prizes {{after the end of}} the war and sold for scrapping. The other two ships, Hamburg <b>and</b> <b>Berlin,</b> were used as training cruisers through the 1920s. They were converted into barracks ships in the mid-1930s, a role they filled for a decade; in 1944, Hamburg was sunk by British bombers and later broken up for scrap, while Berlin was scuttled in deep water after the end of World War II to dispose of a load of chemical weapons.|$|E

5|$|Zagreb {{was one of}} {{the first}} European cities where {{television}} pictures were broadcast. Beginning on 26 August 1939 the Zagreb Fair featured a Philips television system, operated for short periods each day of the exhibition (until 4 September). The Philips television, consisting of a transmitter and several receivers, was operated by Eric Klaas de Vries in the Dutch pavilion at the fair. The fair newspaper announced the event as the first, after television broadcasts in London <b>and</b> <b>Berlin.</b> The programming consisted of comedy, opera, music performances and the first TV news broadcast in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|After {{its season}} in London the company {{performed}} in Vienna, Budapest, Prague <b>and</b> <b>Berlin.</b> The tour was successful, artistically and financially, {{but was not}} without untoward incident. A planned visit to St Petersburg had to be cancelled because the Narodny Dom theatre burned down, and in Vienna the Philharmonic was unequal to the difficulties of the score of Petrushka. The illustrious orchestra revolted at the rehearsal for the first performance, refusing to play for Monteux; only an intervention by Diaghilev restored the rehearsal, {{by the end of}} which Monteux was applauded and Stravinsky given an ovation. In the middle of the tour Monteux was briefly summoned back to Paris by the Concerts Colonne, which had the contractual right to recall him, to deputise for Pierné; his own deputy, Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht, took temporary musical charge of the Ballets Russes.|$|E

5|$|Avinor {{has also}} {{proposed}} lowering the terrain {{east of the}} airport. The terrain is actually flatter to the east, but because the runway was expanded in that direction, the extension cannot be used without removing all ground in the twelve-degree slope. Although it has no impact on smaller aircraft, the reduced runway length has a severe impact {{on the performance of}} Boeing 737 aircraft, which are used by both Norwegian and SAS. For instance, during winter a 180-seat 737-800 can only utilize 71 percent of its permitted take-off weight; this would hinder fully loaded aircraft flying further than Oslo. The impacts for 150-seat 737-700 aircraft are smaller, as they can reach Oslo during winter <b>and</b> <b>Berlin</b> during summer. The airport served 169,428 passengers in 1996 and 216,000 passengers in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Early synth-pop pioneers {{included}} Japanese group Yellow Magic Orchestra, and British bands Ultravox, the Human League <b>and</b> <b>Berlin</b> Blondes; the Human League used monophonic synthesizers {{to produce}} {{music with a}} simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of Gary Numan in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including late-1970s debutants like Japan and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and newcomers such as Depeche Mode and Eurythmics. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success {{opened the way for}} synth-pop bands such as P-Model, Plastics, and Hikashu. The development of inexpensive polyphonic synthesizers, the definition of MIDI and the use of dance beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the New Romantic movement, together with the rise of MTV, led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts (including Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet) in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Georg Emil Hansen (1833–1891) from Næstved {{came from}} a family of photographers. When his father, Carl Christian Hansen, opened a studio in Copenhagen, he decided to open one of his own. He {{became one of the most}} {{respected}} photographers of his day, with Christian IX of Denmark and the Danish Royal Family as customers in the early 1860s. He also excelled in adopting new techniques. He was the first to use paper prints and to make full-length portrait enlargements. He received awards for his exhibitions in London (1862) <b>and</b> <b>Berlin</b> (1865). In 1867, together with his brother, Niels Christian Hansen, and two other photographers, he set up a photographic firm which later became Hansen, Schou & Weller, suppliers to the royal Danish court.|$|E
