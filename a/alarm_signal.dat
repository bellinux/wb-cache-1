25|$|Vespula squamosa, the {{southern}} yellowjacket, {{is a social}} wasp. This species can be identified by its distinctive black and yellow patterning and orange queen. These yellowjackets are typically found in the eastern United States, and its territory extends {{as far south as}} eastern Mexico and Guatemala. Within these territories, they create enormous, multiple-comb nests. The colonies may be either annual or perennial depending on the climate, and in many perennial nests, polygyny takes place. In addition, this species uses pheromones both as a sexual attractant and an <b>alarm</b> <b>signal.</b> This species feeds on insects and animal carcasses; it does not produce honey. V. squamosa, a social insect, has developed a parasitic relationship with the species V. vidua and V. maculifrons. Due to their painful, venomous stings, the species is considered a pest.|$|E
25|$|Mobbing {{calls are}} signals {{made by the}} mobbing species while harassing a predator. These differ from alarm calls, which allow con-specifics {{to escape from the}} predator. The great tit, a European songbird, uses such a signal to call on nearby birds to harass a perched bird of prey, such as an owl. This call occurs in the 4.5kHz range, and carries over long distances. However, when prey species are in flight, they employ an <b>alarm</b> <b>signal</b> in the 7–8kHz range. This call is less {{effective}} at traveling great distances, but is much more difficult for both owls and hawks to hear (and detect the direction from which the call came). In the case of the alarm call, it could be disadvantageous to the sender if the predator picks up on the signal, hence selection has favored those birds able to hear and employ calls in this higher frequency range.|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} fishes possess damage-released {{chemical}} <b>alarm</b> <b>signals,</b> that {{play a critical}} role in the detection and avoidance of potential predation threats. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the ability of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and finescale dace (Phoxinus neogaeus) to detect and respond to conspecific <b>alarm</b> <b>signals</b> is significantly reduced under weakly acidic conditions (pH 6. 0). Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) possess an analogous <b>alarm</b> <b>signaling</b> system. It is unknown, however if the trout <b>alarm</b> <b>signaling</b> system is likewise affected by relatively small changes in pH. I conducted laboratory and field trials to examine the potential effects of acute exposure to weakly acidic (pH 6. 0) conditions on the detection and response of conspecific <b>alarm</b> <b>signals</b> by juvenile trout. My laboratory results demonstrate that while juvenile rainbow trout exhibit significant increases in antipredator behaviour under normal pH conditions (pH 7. 0 - 7. 2), they do not respond to the presence of conspecific chemical <b>alarm</b> <b>signals</b> (i. e. response is not different from controls) under weakly acidic conditions. Similarly, natural population of brook charr failed to detect conspecific alarm cues in a weakly acidic stream (mean pH 6. 11) while they responded to these cues in a neutral stream (mean pH of 6. 88). These data suggest significant, sub-lethal effects of acid precipitation on the ability of prey fishes to detect and respond to conspecific alarm cues in natural waterways...|$|R
500|$|Specific types: alarm; contact; duet; antiphonal duetting; food begging; flight; mobbing. A type of bird vocalization {{tending to}} serve such {{functions}} as giving alarm or keeping {{members of a}} flock in contact—as opposed to a bird's , which is longer and more complex and is usually associated with courtship and mating. Individual birds may be sensitive enough to identify each other through their calls. Many birds that nest in colonies can locate their chicks using their calls. Alarm calls are used to sound alarm to other individuals. Food-begging calls are made by baby birds to beg for food, such as the [...] "wah" [...] of infant blue jays. Mobbing calls signal other individuals in mobbing species while harassing a predator. They differ from alarm calls, which alert other species members to allow escape from predators. As an example, the great tit, a European songbird, uses such a signal to call on nearby birds to harass a perched bird of prey, such as an owl. This call occurs in the 4.5kHz range, and carries over long distances. However, when such prey species are in flight, they employ an <b>alarm</b> <b>signal</b> in the 7–8kHz range. This call is less effective at traveling great distances, but {{is much more difficult}} for both owls and hawks to hear (and detect the direction from which the call came). Contact calls are used by birds for the purpose of letting others of their species know their location. Relatedly, flight calls are vocalizations made by birds while flying, which often serve to keep flocks together. These calls are also used for when birds want to alert others that they are taking flight. Many birds engage in duet calls—a call made by two birds at or nearly at the same time. In some cases, the duets are so perfectly timed as to appear almost as one call. This kind of calling is termed antiphonal duetting. Such duetting is noted {{in a wide range of}} families including quails, bushshrikes, babblers such as [...] scimitar babblers and some owls and parrots.|$|E

2500|$|An animal {{defending}} {{against a}} predator may engage in either [...] "fight or flight" [...] {{in response to}} predator attack or threat of attack, depending on its estimate of the predator's strength relative to its own. Alternative defenses include a range of antipredator adaptations, including alarm signals. An example of an <b>alarm</b> <b>signal</b> is nerol, a chemical which {{is found in the}} mandibular glands of Trigona fulviventris individuals. Release of nerol by T. fulviventris individuals in the nest has been shown to decrease the number of individuals leaving the nest by fifty percent, as well as increasing aggressive behaviors like biting. Alarm signals like nerol can also act as attraction signals; in T. fulviventris, individuals that have been captured by a predator may release nerol to attract nestmates, who will proceed to attack or bite the predator.|$|E

40|$|Many animals {{respond to}} the threat of {{predation}} by producing <b>alarm</b> <b>signals</b> that warn other individuals of the presence of danger or otherwise reduce the success of predators. While <b>alarm</b> <b>signals</b> may be visual or auditory as well as chemical, alarm pheromones are common, especially among insects and aquatic organisms. Plants too emit chemical signals in response to attack by insect herbivores that recruit the herbivores’ natural enemies and can induce preparations for defense in neighboring plants (or other parts of the same plant). In this chapter we discuss our current understanding of chemical <b>alarm</b> <b>signaling</b> in a variety of animal groups (including social and pre-social insects, marine invertebrates, fish, and mammals) and in plants. We also briefly discuss the exploitation of alarm pheromones as foraging cues for natural enemies.

2500|$|The word [...] "conventional" [...] is slang used to {{distinguish}} the method used {{to communicate with the}} control unit in newer addressable systems. So called [...] "conventional detectors" [...] are smoke detectors used in older interconnected systems and resemble electrical switches by their way of working. These detectors are connected in parallel to the signaling path so that the current flow is monitored to indicate a closure of the circuit path by any connected detector when smoke or other similar environmental stimulus sufficiently influences any detector. The resulting increase in current flow (or a dead short) is interpreted and processed by the control unit as a confirmation of the presence of smoke and a fire <b>alarm</b> <b>signal</b> is generated. In a conventional system, smoke detectors are typically wired together in each zone and a single fire alarm control panel usually monitors a number of zones which can be arranged to correspond to different areas of a building. In the event of a fire, the control panel is able to identify which zone or zones contain the detector or detectors in alarm, but can not identify which individual detector or detectors {{are in a state of}} alarm.|$|E

We examined {{the nature of these}} <b>alarm</b> <b>signals</b> after exposure of skin residential cells to contact allergens (nickel sulfate and potassium dichromate) and a contact irritant [sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) ]. Nickel sulfate, potassium dichromate, and SDS were applied topically to the stratum corneum of human skin equivalents. A similar concentration-dependent increase in chemokine (CCL 20, CCL 27, and CXCL 8) secretion was observed for all three chemicals. Exposure to nickel sulfate and SDS was investigated in more detail: similar to chemokine secretion, no difference was observed in the time- and concentration-dependent increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine [interleukin- 1 α (IL- 1 α) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) ] secretion. Maximal increase in IL- 1 α secretion occurred within 2 h after exposure to both nickel sulfate and SDS and prior to increased chemokine secretion. TNF-α secretion was detectable 8 h after chemical exposure. After allergen or irritant exposure, increased CCL 20 and CXCL 8, but not CCL 27, secretion was inhibited by neutralizing human antibodies to either IL- 1 α or TNF-α. Our data show that <b>alarm</b> <b>signals</b> consist of primary and secondary signals. IL- 1 α and TNF-α are released as primary <b>alarm</b> <b>signals,</b> which trigger the release of secondary chemokine (CCL 20 and CXCL 8) <b>alarm</b> <b>signals.</b> However, some chemokines, for example, CCL 27 can be secreted in an IL- 1 α and TNF-α independent manner. Our data suggest that skin residential cells respond to both allergen and irritant exposure by releasing mediators that initiate infiltration of immune responsive cells into the skin. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2005...|$|R

40|$|The {{value of}} {{individual}} discrimination is straightforward for many signal contexts, such as with contact or isolation calls, territorial marks, or status announcements. In contrast, {{the value of}} individual discrimination is less straightforward for <b>alarm</b> <b>signals,</b> {{and it is not}} yet known how or under what circumstances individual discrimination would be beneficial in an alarm context. One proposed mechanism is that receivers may discriminate individual signalers and respond differently based on the signaler's reliability, and that this may allow the receivers to optimize their antipredator behavior. To evaluate this mechanism, I constructed a dynamic model to test the fitness outcomes of 5 receiver response strategies under varying environmental, life history, and social conditions. The individual discrimination strategy yielded the highest fitness under the widest range of conditions, and the difference was substantial except in cases of very low predation pressure and high signaler accuracy. The adaptive value of individual discrimination of <b>alarm</b> <b>signals</b> may thus be a general phenomenon in nature and may provide evolutionary pressure for animals to increase their discrimination abilities. For species that use <b>alarm</b> <b>signals</b> nepotistically, the value of individual discrimination could provide selective pressure for the evolution of individual signatures in alarms and may help explain why the <b>alarm</b> <b>signals</b> of many species are so individualistic.
