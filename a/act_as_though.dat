25|$|Gödel's Platonism postulates {{a special}} kind of {{mathematical}} intuition that lets us perceive mathematical objects directly. (This view bears resemblances to many things Husserl said about mathematics, and supports Kant's idea that mathematics is synthetic a priori.) Davis and Hersh have suggested in their book The Mathematical Experience that most mathematicians <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they are Platonists, even though, if pressed to defend the position carefully, they may retreat to formalism (see below).|$|E
25|$|People with OCD {{understand}} that their notions do not correspond with reality; however, {{they feel that they}} must <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> their notions are correct. For example, an individual who engages in compulsive hoarding might be inclined to treat inorganic matter as if it had the sentience or rights of living organisms, while accepting that such behavior is irrational on a more intellectual level. There is a debate {{as to whether or not}} hoarding should be considered with other OCD symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Because of her {{dispute with}} the Daughters of Darkness Zoe is forced to stay the night and agrees to sleep with Jerome. Act 1 scene 2 begins the next morning with Jerome working on two short {{compositions}} using secretly sampled sounds of Zoe. The first, using her laugh, she finds entertaining although she suggests some changes. The second, using sounds of their love-making, horrify her and after arguing she exits in disgust, never to reappear. This leaves Jerome with nobody to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she is his fiancée at next week's meeting. As he experiments with using Nan to create new sounds, he suddenly has {{the idea of having}} Nan play the part instead of an actress. The act ends as he removes {{the back of her head}} in preparation for re-programming.|$|E

500|$|Williams {{argued that}} Kant {{had given the}} [...] "purest, deepest and most {{thorough}} representation of morality," [...] but that the [...] "honourable instincts of Kantianism to defend the individuality of individuals against the agglomerative indifference of Utilitarianism" [...] may not be effective against the Kantian [...] "abstract character of persons as moral agents." [...] We should {{not be expected to}} <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> we are not who we are in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.|$|E
500|$|As Polonius's son Laertes {{prepares to}} depart {{for a visit}} to France, Polonius gives him {{contradictory}} advice that culminates in the ironic maxim [...] "to thine own self be true." [...] Polonius's daughter, Ophelia, admits her interest in Hamlet, but both Polonius and Laertes warn her against seeking the prince's attention. That night on the rampart, the ghost appears to Hamlet, telling the prince that he was murdered by Claudius and demanding that Hamlet avenge him. Hamlet agrees and the ghost vanishes. The prince confides to Horatio and the sentries that from now on he plans to [...] "put an antic disposition on," [...] or <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he has gone mad, and forces them to swear to keep his plans for revenge secret. Privately, however, he remains uncertain of the ghost's reliability.|$|E
500|$|Paul Babeu, {{the sheriff}} of Pinal County, Arizona, {{appeared}} on The Political Cesspool on July 10, 2010 to discuss illegal immigration; during the interview, {{he referred to}} James Edwards as a [...] "great American". Less than two weeks later, Babeu's spokesman issued an apology, {{saying that he had}} not researched the show thoroughly enough before scheduling the interview and that Babeu has a policy of not conducting interviews with hate groups. Babeu himself said that he was [...] "hoodwinked" [...] into appearing on the show and that he rejects [...] "any hate or bigotry". Prior to the interview, cohost Eddie Miller said that [...] "Of all the people we’ve interviewed on this radio show, I would say the only people that came close to getting me this excited was Dr. David Duke." [...] Following Babeu's spokesman's apology, Edwards alleged that Babeu was aware of the show's true ideology prior to appearing on the show, saying: [...] "For Sheriff Babeu to change his mind and now regret coming on our show, for whatever reason, is his right. For him to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he had no idea of our ideology is a lie." [...] As a result of the controversy surrounding Babeu's appearance on the show, Arizona U.S. Senate candidate J. D. Hayworth asked his primary opponent, John McCain, to drop several campaign ads featuring McCain and Babeu. In 2011, another sheriff, Dennis Spruell of Montezuma County, Colorado, also apologized after appearing on the show without knowing its actual agenda.|$|E

2500|$|Muppets tend to develop, as writer Michael Davis put it, [...] "organically", {{meaning that}} the puppeteers take time, often up to a year, slowly {{developing}} their characters and voices. Muppets are also, as Davis said, [...] "test-driven, passed around from one Henson troupe member to another {{in the hope of}} finding the perfect human-Muppet match". When interacting with Muppets, children tended to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the Muppets were living creatures, even when they could see the puppeteers.|$|E
2500|$|Polarity {{also has}} an effect on allylic strain. In terms of stereoselectivity, polar groups act like large, bulky groups. [...] Even though two groups may have {{approximately}} the same A values the polar group will <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were much bulkier. [...] This is due to the donor character of the polar group. [...] Polar groups increase the HOMO energy of the σ-system in the transition state. [...] This causes the transition state to be in a much more favorable position when the polar group is not interacting in a 1,3 allylic strain.|$|E

50|$|Vakri grahas or {{retrograde}} planets do {{not always}} produce bad results, they impel reconsideration of functions associated with them. When planets are retrograde their power to do good or bad is enhanced, then benefic planets become more benevolent and malefic planets more malevolent. However, Phaladeepika makes no such distinction. Saravali holding the view that exalted planets when retrograde have no strength, tells us that whereas retrograde benefics confer kingship, retrograde malefics give misery and aimless wandering. Uttara Kalamrita agrees with the view that Vakragati is equal to exaltation, if a planet joins a Vakri graha its strength is reduced by half, if retrogression is in own sign of exaltation then the Vakri graha <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> debilitated, if it is debilitated and also retrograde it <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it is exalted.|$|R

2500|$|The Hermetic alchemists {{asserted}} that the Great Work was an opus contra naturam; Paul's use of [...] "against nature" [...] (παρὰ φύσιν, [...] ) may {{have been given a}} similar allegorical meaning by the Naassene exegete. It is certainly possible that the Naassenes viewed homosexuality as exemplifying their concept of androgyny. Carl Jung remarked, [...] "such a disposition should not be adjudged negative in all circumstances, in so far as it preserves the archetype of the Original Man, which a one-sided sexual being has, up to a point, lost." [...] But as to evidence of any [...] "unseemly" [...] acts, Hippolytus writes that in every way, [...] "they are not emasculated, and yet they <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they were." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first Roman emperor to {{have married}} {{a man was}} Nero, who is {{reported}} to have married two other males on different occasions. The first was with one of Nero's own freedmen, Pythagoras, with whom Nero took the role of the bride. Later, as a groom, Nero married Sporus, a young boy, to replace the adolescent female concubine he had killed and married him in a very public ceremony with all the solemnities of matrimony, after which Sporus was forced to pretend to be the female concubine that Nero had killed and <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they were really married. A friend gave the [...] "bride" [...] away as required by law. The marriage was celebrated in both Greece and Rome in extravagant public ceremonies.|$|E
2500|$|Former U.S. Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales and David N. Strange, an {{immigration}} lawyer, called Napolitano's action [...] "not {{consistent with the}} law". They cited the Windsor decision's own emphasis on same-sex marriages {{as defined by the}} states for state purposes, while immigration is an entirely federal matter. They noted that the Ninth Circuit's decision in Adams v. Howerton (1982), which the same court cited in 2010, held the word spouse as used in immigration law can not be read to mean same-sex spouse. They advised that [...] "Congress ... should also take up the issue of immigration benefits for same-sex couples, to provide clarity given the legal uncertainty around this matter. The Supreme Court has not settled this question, and the Obama administration should not <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it has." ...|$|E

50|$|The 1999 South Park episode, Prehistoric Ice Man, was {{a parody}} of the film, wherein the boys find a man that has been frozen in ice since 1996.

2500|$|In dependency, the {{essential}} {{aim of the}} group is to attain security through, and have its members protected by, one individual. The basic assumption in this group culture {{seems to be that}} an external object exists whose function it is to provide security for the immature individual. The group members behave passively, and <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the leader, by contrast, is omnipotent and omniscient. For example, the leader may pose a question only to be greeted with docile silence, as though he or she had not spoken at all. The leader may be idealized into a kind of god who can take care of his or her children, and some especially ambitious leaders may be susceptible to this role. Resentment at being dependent may eventually lead the group members to [...] "take down" [...] the leader, and then search for a new leader to repeat the process.|$|E
2500|$|Frame asks {{where we}} can find moral {{responsibility}} and freedom in Kant's scheme. He argues that Kant believed that while we couldn't prove that man was a responsible moral agent we must nevertheless <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> this were the case. Philosophers have described these as Kant’s [...] "two worlds" [...] the world of nature (which leads to determinism), {{and the world of}} freedom (where responsibility is found). Kant himself spoke of the [...] "starry skies above" [...] and the [...] "moral law within", and although Kant did not deny the regularity of the natural world and the reality of humanity’s [...] "moral motions," [...] his philosophy could not bring these two worlds together. Frame concludes that Kant made the [...] "upper story leap" [...] to irrationalism by asserting the truth of something with no rational justification. Thus, in Immanuel Kant, Frame finds both rationalism and irrationalism.|$|E
2500|$|Paparazzi {{photographs}} {{obtained from}} location filming on 30 June 2015 were publicised via Daily Mail showing {{a car crash}} stunt being filmed. Wall, Wood, Franks were all photographed filming alongside Wood-Davis, with the characters of Kim and Esther pictured bloody suggesting they come off worse in the crash. Location filming continued on 2 July with explosion stunts and pictured Wood cradling Fletcher, indicating Trevor's son Dylan would also {{be involved in the}} smash. Hollyoaks released a trailer with advance spoilers revealing that Kim would orchestrate a car chase amongst the escalated drama surrounding Esther's surrogacy. The car chase was filmed using stunt drivers placed on top of the vehicles and pod cameras attached to them. This allowed the actors to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they were driving the vehicle despite the stunt man being in control. The car which contains Kim and Esther was crashed using a police van which collides with it. The car crash stunt itself was filmed separate and actors were not required to be in the vehicles at that point. Real fire, smoke, fire engines and fire fighters were included in the scenes to help create an authentic scene of mayhem during the post-crash scenes. On-set Wood-Davis said that Kim [...] "is the driving force of it really." [...] She explained that Kim realised Grace did not want her and she decided to run off with Curtis in an act of revenge.|$|E

2500|$|In her 2010 appearances, River {{continues}} to hint at {{a relationship with}} the Doctor in her relative past and his relative future. In [...] "The Big Bang", River suggests to the Doctor that she is married to him in his personal future. When River kisses the Doctor in [...] "Day of the Moon", it becomes clear that whereas this is the Doctor's first kiss with her, it is to be her last with him and that she shall soon be heading to The Library where she dies. In [...] "A Good Man Goes to War", River is seen returning from a date with the future Doctor, and repeatedly calls the present-day Doctor [...] "my love". In [...] "Let's Kill Hitler", a young River Song compares herself to Mrs. Robinson and kisses the Doctor; the first time in an attempt to kill him, the second to save his life. Later she resolves to study archaeology so that she can encounter the Doctor again. Because she loves him, she refuses to shoot him in [...] "The Wedding of River Song", creating an alternate timeline. In this world, the Doctor marries River in a very brief ceremony witnessed by Amy and Rory, so that he may allow time to return to normal and go to his death, while secretly disclosing to River that he will fake his death. Although the alternate timeline is erased, all future episodes <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the wedding was real. Later, when Dorium comments that River is incarcerated in the Stormcage for [...] "all her days", the Doctor responds [...] "Her days, yes, her nights...well...that's between her and me". After this episode, the banter and gentle sexual innuendo between them becomes less teasing and more serious.|$|E

This concept is analogous to electrical conductance in the electric circuit.|$|R
