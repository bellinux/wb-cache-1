40|$|Despite {{increasing}} interest for rural landscapes, information technology advances, and transportation improvements, rural areas generally continue {{to lag behind}} urban ones with respect to many socioeconomic indicators. Those rural areas that experience significant growth, however, are either located close to metropolitan areas or offer outstanding <b>amenities</b> that attract population and firms. Landscapes, as <b>amenities,</b> are defined as location-specific features that enhance the attractiveness of a given location. The empirical connection between <b>amenities</b> and regional growth has been established, but supply and demand issues of <b>amenities</b> and how their presence might lead to increased development still need clarification. This survey paper deals with several issues. First, <b>amenities</b> and landscapes and their characteristics are defined and described, particularly as economic goods. Second, supply and demand factors for <b>amenities</b> are presented. Third, the links between <b>amenities,</b> landscapes and regional development are explained, via both impact mechanisms and institutional arrangements. Last, key public policy and further research issues are outlined. landscape, <b>amenities,</b> rural area, regional development, economic development. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Amenities</b> such as good food, {{attentive}} staff, {{and pleasant}} surroundings may {{play an important}} role in hospital demand. We use a marketing survey to measure <b>amenities</b> at hospitals in greater Los Angeles and analyze the choice behavior of Medicare pneumonia patients in this market. We find that the mean valuation of <b>amenities</b> is positive and substantial. From the patient perspective, hospital quality therefore embodies <b>amenities</b> as well as clinical quality. We also find that a one-standard-deviation increase in <b>amenities</b> raises a hospital's demand by 38. 4 % on average, whereas demand is substantially less responsive to clinical quality as measured by pneumonia mortality. These findings imply that hospitals may have an incentive to compete in <b>amenities,</b> with potentially important implications for welfare. ...|$|R
5|$|In {{its native}} range, the {{sycamore}} {{is associated with}} a biodiverse range of invertebrates and fungi, but these are not always present in areas to which it has been introduced. It is sometimes planted in urban areas for its value as an <b>amenity</b> tree and produces a hard-wearing, creamy-white close-grained timber that is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood flooring and kitchen utensils. It also makes good firewood. The rising sap in spring has been used to extract sugar and make alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, and honey is made by bees collecting the nectar.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{are often}} planted in town environments {{where they are}} known as street trees or <b>amenity</b> trees.

It has been shown that they are beneficial to humans in creating a sense of well-being and reducing stress. Many towns have initiated tree-planting programmes. In London for example, there is an initiative to plant 20,000 new street trees and to have an increase in tree cover of 5% by 2025, equivalent to one tree for every resident.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the chief}} {{architectural}} concerns {{for the design of}} venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety.

The Hillsborough disaster {{is an example of how}} poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. Sightlines and acoustics are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{valuation of}} <b>amenities</b> in urban neighborhoods {{and satisfaction with}} both those neighborhoods and life in general. First, rents are used to estimate neighborhood <b>amenities</b> price in San Jose, which explain 39 percent of the standardized variation of rents. Some districts rank very high in housing characteristics but poorly in neighborhood <b>amenities,</b> while others rank poorly in housing characteristics but high in neighborhood <b>amenities,</b> suggesting that indirect policy measures might reduce inequality in urban areas through improving neighborhood <b>amenities.</b> Second, the paper explores differences in the valuation of <b>amenities</b> by calculating prices in different urban areas. In more sparsely populated urban areas, distance to national parks becomes less important, but distance to primary roads becomes more important. Finally, housing and safety satisfaction represent the key components of life satisfaction. ...|$|R
5|$|In the 1960s, {{the value}} of the towpath as a leisure <b>amenity</b> began to be recognised. The Deputy County Clerk for Hampshire walked along the towpath from end to end in 1966, {{together}} with members of the Ramblers Association. He decided that rather than challenge the legality of the towpath diversions, he would invite the local authorities through which the navigation ran to assume responsibility for maintaining the towpath. These organisations were Southampton County Borough Council, Eastleigh Borough Council, Winchester Rural District Council and Winchester City Council. The construction of weirs at most of the locks by the Southern Water Authority resulted in water levels being restored on significant parts of the navigation. The powers of the navigation were enshrined in Acts of Parliament obtained in 1665, 1767, 1795, 1802, 1811 and 1820, none of which have been repealed.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} {{white paper}} followed the Bowes Report in February 1959, recommending that an Inland Waterways Redevelopment Advisory Committee should assist schemes to regenerate canals that {{were no longer}} able to collect enough fees from tolls to pay for their upkeep. Further reports followed, and in 1962 the Advisory Committee reported that the canal should be redeveloped, and allocated £20,000 for maintenance and £20,000 to begin restoration. The Kennet and Avon Canal Trust was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from Reading to Bristol as a through navigation and as a public <b>amenity.</b> It was originally a voluntary group which had previously been known as the Kennet and Avon Canal Association. The Trust gained charitable status in April and was incorporated under the Companies Act on 6 June 1962. In 1963 the newly formed British Waterways, which was created by the Transport Act of the previous year, and replaced the British Transport Commission as the statutory body for inland waterways, took over the canal and, in partnership with the Trust and riparian local authorities, restoration work began.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before its}} closure, there was {{interest}} in retaining the canal for its <b>amenity</b> value. The Stroudwater Canal Society, which {{later became the}} Cotswold Canals Trust, was formed in 1972. Following initial hostility from the Proprietors, {{who had not been}} stripped of their powers when the canal had closed, agreement was reached and work began on restoration of the waterway. The project gained popularity, and in 2003, a bid was made to the Heritage Lottery Fund for £82 million to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal. The project had to be split into smaller parts, and only the first phase has so far been funded in this way, when a grant of £11.9 million was confirmed in 2006. With match funding, this was to enable the section from 'The Ocean' at Stonehouse to Wallbridge to be reopened, together with the Wallbridge to Brimscombe Port section of the Thames and Severn.|$|E

40|$|Among {{different}} determinants, <b>amenities</b> play a {{major role}} in the location of tourism activities. In Tourism Economics, an extensive literature investigates the influence of <b>amenities</b> either on destination choice made by tourists or on economic development, generally at a regional or national level. This paper aims at analysing the influence of <b>amenities</b> on the location of hotels at local level. In a first part, after a presentation of the context of our work and a brief survey of existing literature on the link between <b>amenities</b> and tourism, we introduce and describe the different <b>amenities</b> features that will be analysed. In a second part, using a micro-economic model of hotel entry inspired by urban economics literature, we analyse the influence of <b>amenities</b> characteristics on a tourist bid-rent function and then on the number of hotels entering the market. The third part will be dedicated to an estimation of the effect of <b>amenities</b> on the creation of new hotels at the French 'Bassins de vie' level, which are functional economic areas...|$|R

40|$|Regional {{migration}} and growth are increasingly associated with high-quality in situ natural <b>amenities.</b> However, {{most of the}} previous U.

The Great Lakes, with their abundant fresh water and natural <b>amenities,</b> would also appear well-positioned to provide the foundation for this type of economic growth. Yet, while some parts of the western Great Lakes region are prime examples of amenity-led growth, other areas in the eastern Great Lakes may not have capitalized on their natural <b>amenities,</b> perhaps because of their strong industrial legacy. Using a unique county-level dataset for the Great Lakes region (including Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin), we test whether growth in the region is associated with proximity to lake <b>amenities</b> and whether there are offsetting industrial legacy or pollution effects. We also examine whether <b>amenities</b> have additional attraction value for those with high levels of human capital. Consistent with theory that suggests that natural <b>amenities</b> are normal or superior goods, we find that coastal areas in the region are positively associated with increases in shares of college graduates. However, we find little evidence that lake <b>amenities</b> contribute to broader household migration, especially after 2000. Based on these results, there may be opportunities to leverage Great Lake <b>amenities</b> to support economic growth in terms of attracting individuals with high levels of human capital {{who are most likely to}} make quality of life migration decisions. ...|$|R
