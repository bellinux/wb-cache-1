Then, on September 9, 1939 he had accepted an offer to play with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the NFL. Heikkinen had previously refused offers to play pro football, but the persistence of coach Potsy Clark, and Crisler’s assurance that a coaching job would be open for him in 1940, persuaded Heikkinen to try professional football. Heikkinen noted on signing, though, that he would definitely return to law school in 1940. It was reported that Heikkinen signed a contract for “at least $175 a game” with the Dodgers. Heikkinen was cut by the Dodgers after playing only three games.|$|E

The aim is to draw a parallel between how photographic publications perceive and discursively construct borders and the aesthetic strategies used in the pictures themselves.

Using the methods of interpretative anthropology and the perspectives of critical feminist theory, I argue that women's discourse about health and illness is {{one way in which}} they express feelings of loss over the fertility of their youth, <b>ambivalences</b> <b>about</b> their lives in Australia, and grief over a life left behind in Italy. These losses are experienced physically and expressed metaphorically through conditions of bad blood and nerves and are perceived to contribute to their vulnerability to a range of diseases including cancer. For these women, the change of life is experienced as the end of life and their fear of cancer is representative of their fears of social and physical death. Cancer is also seen to be a disease more common in Australia and is used as a metaphor for expressing anxieties relating to feelings of placelessness, of being disconnected from one's roots, and anxieties about becoming old and dying far from 'home. ...|$|R

The debate then examines the transvestite performance of age and femininity, both by male actors cross-dressing as women and by young female actors cross-dressing as old women. Examples include Harry Enfield and Kathy Burke’s performances as the ‘Randy Old Ladies’ from Harry Enfield and Chums (BBC, 1994 - 1997), Catherine Tate as ‘Nan’ in The Catherine Tate Show (BBC, 2004 - 2009) and Brendan O’Carroll’s performance as Agnes Brown in Mrs Brown’s Boys (BBC, 2011 -). These more radical and outrageous accounts of older women in television comedy offer on the one hand a liberating and transgressive vision of aging, but also tend to reiterate cultural stereotypes regarding age and femininity as ‘inappropriate’.

40|$|Anita Allen’s Uneasy Access: Privacy for Women in a Free Society {{was one of}} {{the first}} books to try to work out a feminist {{perspective}} on privacy, given long-standing feminist doubts and <b>ambivalences</b> <b>about</b> its effects on women. In contrast to a philosophical literature which largely ignored feminist concerns with privacy, Allen set out to consider privacy from an explicitly feminist perspective, drawing on philosophical and American legal debates in order to do so. The result was a highly readable book, which provided an excellent survey of competing attempts to describe the nature and value of privacy, and a helpful account of their relative strengths and weaknesses. Arguing that feminists should revise, not reject, privacy, Allen showed that the ability to restrict unwanted access to our bodies and thoughts is essential to freedom for women, as for men. I am, then, grateful to have an opportunity to celebrate Allen’s work and, in particular, a book which has inspired me over the years. Nonetheless, I must agree with Judith DeCew, in her review of Uneasy Access, that its central claims are not wholly persuasive. In [ [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Children occupy an ever-more {{prominent}} {{position in}} public discourse in late-modern Britain, with politicians, {{news media and}} other key definers consistently depicting childhood as inherently problematic. Popular portrayals of juveniles tend to conceive of them as being subject to multifarious ‘risks’, with younger children, in particular, considered vulnerable to all manner of threats – from illnesses and medical emergencies to technological perils to the predations of deviant elements in society. When not threatened themselves, moreover, they are frequently depicted as presenting a menace to others, in a manner redolent of earlier moral panics about subversive youth sub-cultures. Drawing on a rich literature of research into news-making, textual framing and media reception, this thesis uses a triangulated methodology to explore the interplay between contemporary newspaper journalists, their sources of news, the narratives they weave, and (actual or potential) members of their audiences. It argues that the dominant, at times paradoxical, positioning of children – by press and public alike – as either or both of victims and threats amounts to an endemic ‘juvenile panic’, which is rooted in a continuum of <b>ambivalences</b> <b>about</b> minors that can be traced through history. This simmering state of panic boils over whenever it finds purchase in singular dramatic events – fuelled by {{the demands of a}} commercially driven media; journalists’ pragmatic reliance on official sources with fear-promoting agendas; and the public’s appetite for a good horror story. It is further argued that a particular focus on the dangers posed by ‘familiar strangers’ (adult or juvenile) acts as a displacement for deep-seated concerns stemming from recent changes in Britain’s society and economy - notably growing personal insecurity and the slow decline of social trust...|$|R

40|$|On Company Time: American Modernism and the Big Magazines situates the {{evolution}} of American modernism within its capacious mass-market periodical context, {{and in doing so}} finds that hallmark modernist texts such as Willa Cather's The Professor's House and T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land participate in a more complex and far-reaching print ecology than is often understood. I contend that reading modernist formal experimentation within, rather than against, popular print culture raises a new set of questions about how reactions to "mass civilization," to use F. R. Leavis's phrase, feed back into the content of midcentury mass media. By excavating the deep institutional, economic, and aesthetic affiliations that bridge the golden days of modernism and American magazine culture, this study challenges the recent focus on little magazines and coterie circles in determining modernism's cultural circulation. Instead, through readings of Cather, Eliot, W. E. B. Du Bois, Jessie Fauset, James Agee, Kenneth Fearing, Ernest Hemingway, and others, I argue that the influence of little magazines on modernist production and circulation looks rather narrow when compared to well-funded and massively popular titles like McClure's, Time, Life, and Esquire. Rather than simply instantiate a bland mass culture against which modernism reacts, early twentieth-century magazines comprise a heterogeneous cluster of serial publications that differentiated themselves by form, genre, and readership. This double life of modernism and magazines is equally epistemological and formal, for the authors I discuss take their <b>ambivalences</b> <b>about</b> institutional affiliation as an occasion for material and aesthetic experimentation. By simultaneously analyzing literary history, media forms, and narrative structure, I contribute to an emerging body of scholarship at the intersection of media studies, book history, and literary criticism. This study expands the material and institutional history of print culture while attending to the ways authors, genres, and literary styles can move through a literary marketplace...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{considers}} {{the rise of}} the professional author at the Victorian fin de siècle from the perspectives of two popular novelists and their metafictional treatments of authorship. Richard Marsh and Guy Boothby were prolific and commercially successful writers of the 1890 s and the early 20 th century, who attracted fierce censure from a cultural elite that deemed them key representatives of a new kind of author writing for a new kind of readership. Authors such as these, so the argument went, made of literature a trade – and the pursuit of profit and hence, popularity, led to the flooding of the market with novels of inferior quality that squeezed out properly literary work. The essay explores the context of fin de siècle debates about literary value and literary production, looking briefly at some fictional treatments of the subject in stories by George Gissing and Henry James, before moving on to an exploration of how these issues are negotiated in novels by Marsh and Boothby. Marsh and Boothby made use of literary settings and fictional authors, so the essay argues, in order both to write back to their critics, and to explore some of their own <b>ambivalences</b> <b>about</b> professional authorship. Reading the metanarratives of authorship of these avowedly popular authors uncovers perspectives on the rapidly transforming literary marketplace of the fin de siècle that are both importantly {{different from those of the}} self-consciously highbrow Gissing and James, but also sometimes unexpectedly convergent. In so doing, we gain a richer picture of fin de siècle debates on literary production than is provided by consultation of canonical works alone, and may even encounter new ways of considering the transformations in reading and writing that are underway today...|$|R

40|$|Ambivalences {{in family}} {{caregivers}} {{for older people}} are analysed from an emotion-theoretical {{point of view and}} the benefits of this approach are delineated. The topic is confined to psychological ambivalence as an experience of the individual with a special emphasis on emotional ambivalence as co-presence of positive and negative emotions about the various aspects of adult children’s care provision. The stage for understanding mixed emotions in this context is set through a description of the multi-facetted nature of the caregiving situation: (1) Various difficulties of the older parent (e. g., diseases, problems with activities of daily living, suffering), (2) multiple tasks of the caring adult child (e. g., skilled nursing, help with daily activities, emotional support provision), and (3) several gains and losses for the older person and the caring child. The generation of positive and negative emotions is analysed from a cognitive point of view according to which emotions toward caregiving arise from subjective appraisals of the various facets of the caregiving situation. These appraisals are, in turn, conceived to consist in comparisons between what adult children desire and what they believe with respect to the caregiving situation. Fulfillments of such desires are assumed to lead to positive emotions (joy, pride, admiration, etc.) and frustrations of such desires are assumed to result in negative emotions (sadness, pity, guilt feelings, etc.). Because adult children have multiple desires (e. g., own welfare, welfare of old parent, welfare of other relatives) and multiple beliefs about the caregiving situation, various combinations of positive and negative emotions and thus ambivalences are expected and described. This kind of analysis is further applied to emotional <b>ambivalences</b> <b>about</b> “big care decisions” (e. g., initiating nursing home admission) and “small care decisions” (e. g., taking a care off-time over the weekend). In concluding, heuristic benefits of this emotional-theoretical approach are summarized: Options for a refined description, measurement, understanding and management of emotional ambivalences in the context of intergenerational caregiving...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines education {{programming in}} a men's maximumsecurity prison in rural Central New York. The provision of formal schooling {{has been a}} hallmark of prison reform efforts in New York for over a century, imagined to both ameliorate the conditions of confinement and, upon release, restore inmates to full civic participation and social membership. In documenting the everyday work {{of teaching and learning}} in one such school, this dissertation demonstrates that, rather than representing a formal break with punitive logics and practices, such reform efforts are instrumentalized and assimilated into the custodial management of the institution. For both staff and inmates, navigating the dissonances and incoherencies that emerge as "care" is integrated into "custody" is a defining feature of institutional life that conditions both the structural possibilities and particular socialities that emerge within reform-oriented programs in prison. In tracing structures of care (diagnostic and standardized testing) in the school as they intersect with disciplinary structures of custody (solitary confinement), this research demonstrates that inmates' academic achievement is significantly attenuated by institutional conditions. These institutional conditions are both produced by and reflected in the "security mindset," which affects particular forms of sociality in the school. In managing personal and emotional proximities, this "mindset" remakes a "caring" profession in the image of custodial relations of authority and in the interest of control. This "mindset" is instantiated in the documentary practices of the school, 	   where staff not only track inmates' academic progress, but contribute to the record of punishment. In considering staff and inmates' deep <b>ambivalences</b> <b>about</b> the lived experience of prison reform, this dissertation provides an ethnographically rich account of a pervasive modern institution that is seldom frequented by social researchers. It suggests that processes of carceral subject-making are neither coherent, nor uncontested, but mediated by extensive self-reflexive and intersubjective critique and negotiation. Given the influence of the prison as a historical formation on anthropological investigations of modern power/knowledge, this dissertation demonstrates that the contemporary prison itself is a key analytical site for understanding the empirical realities, as much as theoretical implications, of the current era of hyperincarceration. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|R
