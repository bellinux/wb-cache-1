5|$|Despite Reich's {{precarious}} mental health, {{his work}} on character {{and the idea of}} muscular <b>armouring</b> contributed to the development of what is now known as ego psychology, gave rise to body psychotherapy, and helped shape the Gestalt therapy of Fritz Perls, the bioenergetic analysis of Reich's student Alexander Lowen, and the primal therapy of Arthur Janov.|$|E
5|$|The iron {{industry}} was pursued by both private entrepreneurs who owned their own smelters {{as well as}} government-supervised smelting facilities. The Song economy was stable enough to produce over a hundred million kilograms (over two hundred million pounds) of iron product a year. Large-scale deforestation in China would have continued {{if not for the}} 11th-century innovation of the use of coal instead of charcoal in blast furnaces for smelting cast iron. Much of this iron was reserved for military use in crafting weapons and <b>armouring</b> troops, but some was used to fashion the many iron products needed to fill the demands of the growing domestic market. The iron trade within China was advanced by the construction of new canals, facilitating the flow of iron products from production centres to the large market in the capital city.|$|E
25|$|Only {{one size}} of {{particle}} is considered in this equation. However, river beds are often formed by {{a mixture of}} sediment of various sizes. In case of partial motion where {{only a part of}} the sediment mixture moves, the river bed becomes enriched in large gravel as the smaller sediments are washed away. The smaller sediments present under this layer of large gravel have a lower possibility of movement and total sediment transport decreases. This is called <b>armouring</b> effect. Other forms of <b>armouring</b> of sediment or decreasing rates of sediment erosion can be caused by carpets of microbial mats, under conditions of high organic loading.|$|E
50|$|Kusari was {{commonly}} used to connect the <b>armour</b> plates on the sangu (three extremity <b>armours),</b> the haidate (thigh <b>armour),</b> suneate (shin <b>armour),</b> and kote (armored sleeves), the <b>armour</b> for these items could also be composed almost entirely of kusari. Kusari was also used to connect the <b>armour</b> plates on many types of tatami <b>armour.</b> Kusari {{could also be used}} as the main <b>armour</b> for the dou/dō (chest <b>armour),</b> for the kusazuri (tassets) of the dou/dō and on the sode (shoulder <b>armour).</b> Many types of Japanese auxiliary <b>armours</b> used kusari in their construction or as the mail <b>armour</b> defense. Kusari katabira (chain <b>armour</b> jackets) were a common <b>armour</b> item as well as kusari zukin (chain <b>armour</b> hoods). Shikoro (neck guards) on kabuto (helmets) and hachi gane (forehead protectors) could have kusari as the mail <b>armour</b> defense.|$|R
50|$|Traditional Japanese <b>armour</b> had six main {{components}} (hei-no-rokugu, roku gu, or roku gusoku), the dou or dō (chest <b>armour),</b> kabuto (helmet), mengu (facial <b>armour),</b> kote (armoured sleeves), sune-ate (shin <b>armour),</b> and the hai-date (thigh <b>armour).</b> The sangu {{was composed of}} the suneate (shin <b>armour),</b> kote (armored sleeves), haidate (thigh <b>armour).</b> These <b>armour</b> components were {{a combination of a}} cloth backing and various types of <b>armour</b> that was attached to the cloth backing.

25|$|Riveting {{is one of}} {{the most}} ancient {{metalwork}} joining processes. Its use has declined markedly during the second half of the 20th century, but it still retains important uses in industry and construction, and in artisan crafts such as jewellery, medieval <b>armouring</b> and Metal Couture into the 21st century. The earlier use of rivets is being superseded by improvements in welding and component fabrication techniques.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{introduction}} of steam-power, the use of iron armour was leading to another revolution in design at about the same time. Dupuy de Lôme applied his talents to this field as well, by showing the practicability of <b>armouring</b> the sides of a wooden-built ship. In 1857 he was appointed to the highest office in the Constructive Corps—Directeur du Matériel—and his design for the earliest seagoing ironclad, La Gloire, was approved in the same year. La Gloire was built fairly quickly, and was followed by a construction program that delivered a total of five such ships by 1863.|$|E
50|$|The {{six major}} {{articles}} or components of Japanese <b>armour</b> (hei-no-rokugu, roku gu, or roku gusoku) are the dou or dō (chest <b>armour),</b> kabuto (helmet), mengu (facial <b>armour),</b> kote (armoured sleeves), sune-ate (shin <b>armour),</b> and the hai-date (thigh <b>armour).</b> Additional <b>armour</b> protection {{was available for}} the neck, armpit, chest, waist and feet. These auxiliary <b>armours</b> covered areas {{of the body that}} were exposed by gaps in the regular <b>armour</b> items or were additional protection was required.|$|R
50|$|In 1543, the Portuguese brought matchlock {{firearms}} (tanegashima) to Japan. The Japanese {{started to}} manufacture the Portuguese acquired matchlocks {{and the use}} of these firearms in warfare caused the gradual decline {{in the use of the}} centuries-old lamellar <b>armour</b> that the samurai were known for; the Japanese <b>armour</b> makers started to use solid iron plates in their <b>armour</b> designs which were based on European <b>armours,</b> and eventually plate <b>armour</b> became the standard for samurai warriors. The new style Japanese plate <b>armours</b> were called tosei gusoku (new <b>armours)</b> in order to differentiate from the old style lamellar <b>armours.</b> Japanese <b>armour</b> makers designed bulletproof plate <b>armours</b> called tameshi gusoku or (bullet tested), which allowed soldiers to continue wearing <b>armour</b> despite the heavy use of firearms in the late 1500s.|$|R

500|$|Reich {{established}} the Orgonomic Infant Research Center (OIRC) in 1950, {{with the aim}} of preventing muscular <b>armouring</b> in children from birth. Meetings were held in the basement of his house in Forest Hills. Turner wrote that several children who were treated by OIRC therapists later said they had been sexually abused by the therapists, although not by Reich. One woman said she was assaulted by one of Reich's associates when she was five years old. Children were asked to stand naked in front of Reich and a group of 30 therapists in his basement, while Reich described the children's [...] "blockages." [...] Reich's daughter, Lore Reich Rubin, told Turner that she believed her father was an abuser, although she did not say she had been abused by him, and she acknowledged that she had no evidence. She believed that Reich himself had been abused as a child, which is why he developed such an interest in sex and childhood sexuality.|$|E
500|$|The United States Navy's 'Standard type battleships', {{beginning}} with the , were designed with long-range engagements and plunging fire in mind; {{the first of these}} was laid down in 1912, four years before the Battle of Jutland taught the dangers of long-range fire to European navies. Important features of the standard battleships were 'all or nothing' armour and 'raft' construction—based on a design philosophy which held that only those parts of the ship worth giving the thickest possible protection were worth <b>armouring</b> at all, and that the resulting armoured [...] "raft" [...] should contain enough reserve buoyancy to keep afloat the entire ship in the event the unarmoured bow and stern were thoroughly punctured and flooded. This design was proven in battle at the 1942 Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, when an ill-timed turn by [...] silhouetted her to Japanese guns. In spite of receiving 26 heavy hits, her armoured raft remained untouched and she remained both afloat and operational at the end of action.|$|E

50|$|The {{use of the}} armour as {{the means}} of {{providing}} earthing to the equipment supplied by the cable (a function technically known as the circuit protective conductor or CPC) {{is a matter of}} debate within the electrical installation industry. It is sometimes the case that an additional core within the cable is specified as the CPC (for instance, instead of using a two core cable for line and neutral and the <b>armouring</b> as the CPC, a three core cable is used) or an external earth wire is run alongside the cable to serve as the CPC. Primary concerns are the relative conductivity of the <b>armouring</b> compared to the cores (which reduces as the cable size increases) and reliability issues. Recent articles by authoritative sources have analysed the practice in detail and concluded that, for the majority of situations, the <b>armouring</b> is adequate to serve as the CPC under UK wiring regulations.|$|E
