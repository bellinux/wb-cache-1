40|$|Pesticides in soil {{are subject}} {{to a number of}} {{processes}} that result in transformation and biodegradation, sorption to and desorption from soil components, and diffusion and leaching. Pesticides leaching through a soil profile will be exposed to changing environmental conditions as different horizons with distinct physical, chemical and biological properties are encountered. The many ways in which soil properties influence pesticide retention and degradation need to be addressed to allow accurate predictions of environmental fate and the potential for groundwater pollution. Degradation and sorption processes were investigated in a long-term (100 days) study of the chloroacetanilide herbicide, <b>acetochlor.</b> Soil cores were collected from a clay soil profile and samples taken from 0 - 30 cm (surface), 1. 0 - 1. 3 m (mid) and 2. 7 - 3. 0 m (deep) and treated with <b>acetochlor</b> (2. 5, 1. 25, 0. 67 ?g <b>acetochlor</b> g - 1 dry wt soil, respectively). In sterile and non-sterile conditions, <b>acetochlor</b> concentration in the aqueous phase declined rapidly from the surface and subsoil layers, predominantly through nonextractable residue (NER) formation on soil surfaces, but also through biodegradation and biotic transformation. Abiotic transformation was also evident in the sterile soils. Several metabolites were produced, including acetochlor-ethane sulphonic acid and acetochlor-oxanilic acid. Transformation was principally microbial in origin, as shown by the differences between non-sterile and sterile soils. NER formation increased rapidly over the first 21 days in all soils and was mainly associated with the macroaggregate (> 2000 ?m diameter) size fractions. It is likely that <b>acetochlor</b> is incorporated into the macroaggregates through oxidative coupling, as humification of particulate organic matter progresses.

O objetivo do presente trabalho, foi estudar o comportamento dos herbicidas residuais {{atrazine}} e <b>acetochlor</b> em mistura com dessecantes no manejo em plantio direto. Para tal, foi instalado um experimento em blocos ao acaso com parcelas subdivididas e quatro repetições. Os tratamentos, alocados na parcela, em número de nove, foram constituidos pelas seguintes misturas de herbicidas: 1) <b>acetochlor</b> + glyphosate; 2) <b>acetochlor</b> + glyphosate + 2, 4 D; 3) <b>acetochlor</b> + paraquat; 4) <b>acetochlor</b> + paraquat + 2, 4 D; 5) atrazine + glyphosate; 6) atrazine + glyphosate + 2, 4 D; 7) atrazine + paraquat; 8) atrazine + óleo vegetal; 9) testemunha não tratada. Os tratamentos da sub parcela, em número de dois, foram constituidos pelas modalidades de aplicação dos herbicidas na cobertura vegetal: 1) aplicação com a cobertura "em pé"; 2) aplicação com a cobertura "rolada". A cobertura vegetal de inverno era formada pela consorciação de aveia-preta + ervilhaca comum. Os resultados mostraram que o controle de Brachiaria plantaginea, Euphorbia heterophylla e Bidens pilosa foi melhor efetuado com os tratamentos onde entrou o atrazine. De maneira geral, o controle obtido na modalidade "em pé," foi melhor do que na modalidade "rolada," principalmente nos tratamentos com <b>acetochlor.</b> A análise cromatográfica de resíduos feita em amostras de solo retiradas do experimento antes e após uma chuva de 41 mm ocorrida 24 horas após a aplicação dos tratamentos, mostrou que menos de 6 % do <b>acetochlor</b> aplicado foi detectado no solo, em ambas as modalidades de aplicação. Quanto ao atrazine, no entanto, mais de 78 % do total aplicado foi detectado no solo após a chuva na modalidade "rolada", em qualquer tratamento; neste caso, os maiores valores foram 91 % para atrazine+óleo vegetal e 90 % para atrazine+glyphosate+ 2, 4 D. Na modalidade "em pé'', os maiores valores foram obtidos com atrazine+óleo vegetal (77 %) e com atrazine+glyphosate+ 2, 4 D (70 %).

We have shown that both rat and human liver microsomes metabolize MEA (0. 035 nmol/min/mg and 0. 069 nmol/min/mg, respectively) and DEA (0. 041 nmol/min/mg and 0. 040 nmol/min/mg, respectively). We have also shown that the cytochrome P 450 isoforms responsible for human metabolism of <b>acetochlor,</b> butachlor, and metolachlor are CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 B 6...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{degradation}} of the chloracetamide herbicide <b>acetochlor</b> has been studied under simulated ozonation treatment plant conditions. The {{degradation of}} <b>acetochlor</b> included the formation of several degradation products that were identified using GC/ion-trap mass spectrometry with EI and CI and HPLC/electrospray-QqTOF mass spectrometry. Thirteen ozonation products of <b>acetochlor</b> have been identified. Ozonation of the deuterated herbicide combined to MSn and high-resolution mass measurement allowed effective characterization of the degradation products. At {{the exception of one}} of them, the product B (2 -chloro- 2 ', ethyl- 6 ', methyl-acetanilide), none of the identified degradation products has been already reported in the literature. Post-ozonation kinetics studies revealed that the concentrations of most degradation products evolved noticeably with time, particularly during the first hours following the ozonation treatment. This raises concerns about the fate of degradation products in the effluents of treatment plants and suggests the need for a better control on these products if their toxicity was demonstrated.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{substances}} released into the environment disrupt normal endocrine mechanisms {{in a wide range}} of vertebrates. Little is known about the effects and identities of endocrinedisrupting chemicals (EDCs) that target thyroid hormone (TH) action, particularly at the cellular level. Frog tadpole metamorphosis depends completely on TH, which has led to the suggestion of a metamorphosis-based assay for screening potential EDCs. A major mechanism of TH action is the alteration of gene expression via hormone-bound nuclear receptors. To assess the gene expression profiles in the frog model, we designed a novel multispecies frog cDNA microarray. Recently, the preemergent herbicide <b>acetochlor</b> was shown to accelerate 3, 5, 3 ´-triiodothyronine (T 3) induced forelimb emergence and increase mRNA expression of thyroid hormone β receptors in ranid tadpoles. Here we show that T 3 -induced metamorphosis of Xenopus laevis, a species commonly used in the laboratory, is accelerated upon acute exposure to an environmentally relevant level of <b>acetochlor.</b> The morphologic changes observed are preceded by alterations in gene expression profiles detected in the tadpole tail, and the nature of these profiles suggest a novel mechanism of action for <b>acetochlor.</b> Key words: <b>acetochlor,</b> cDNA array, endocrine disruptor, gene expression, herbicides, metamorphosis, persistent organic pollutants, tadpoles, thyroid hormone, Xenopus laevis.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the antioxidant responses of three bacteria (SD 1. KD and K 9) isolated from soil previously treated with the herbicides metolachlor and <b>acetochlor.</b> By 165 rRNA gene sequencing, we determined that SD 1 is phylogenetically related to Enterobacter asburiae, while KD and K 9 have divergent genomes that more closely resemble that of Enterobacter amnigenus. Decreased levels of lipid peroxidation were observed in SD 1 and KD following treatment with 34 mM metolachlor or 62 mM <b>acetochlor,</b> respectively, indicating that both bacteria were able to adapt to an increase in ROS production. In the presence of 34 mM metolachlor or 62 mM <b>acetochlor,</b> all bacterial isolates exhibited increases in total catalase (CAT) activity (81 % for SDI, 53 % for KD and 59 % for K 9), whereas total SOD activity (assessed based on the profile and intensity of the bands) was slightly reduced when the bacteria were exposed to high concentrations of the herbicides (340 mM metolachlor or 620 mM <b>acetochlor).</b> This effect was due to a specific reduction in SOD IV (K 9 and KD isolates) by 45 % and 90 %, respectively, and SOD V (SD 1 isolate) isoenzymes by 60 %. The most striking result was obtained in the SD 1 isolate, where two novel isoenzymes of glutathione reductase (GR) that responded specifically to metolachlor were identified. In addition, <b>acetochlor</b> was shown to induce the expression of a new 57 kDa protein band in the K 9 and KD isolates. The bacteria isolated from the herbicide-contaminated soil exhibited an efficient antioxidant system response at herbicide concentrations of up to 34 mM metolachlor or 62 mM <b>acetochlor.</b> These data suggest a mechanism for tolerance that may include the control of an imbalance in ROS production versus scavenging. The data suggest that specific isoenzymes of CAT and GR could be involved in this herbicide tolerance mechanism. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>acetochlor</b> residue in {{the tobacco}} {{cultivated}} soils {{was inclined to}} affect the growth of tobacco. In this study, regarding the <b>acetochlor</b> as the inorganic salt medium with the sole carbon source, we obtain the acetochlor-degrading bacteria from the tobacco cultivated soil through isolation and screening, numbering as CSUFTM 78. Under {{the view of the}} microscopy, the bacteria has a rod shape and no spore with the size of 0. 8 ~ 1. 5 × 0. 4 ~ 0. 6 µm; in the medium, the colonies are opaque, white, round, convex with neat edge and moist and shiny surface. Then determine the concentration of <b>acetochlor</b> which was directly added into the liquid medium and the phote-absorbance of strain number using UV spectrophotometer. The results indicate that the strain CSUFTM 78 can grow in the inorganic salt medium which regards quinclorac as the sole carbon source; besides, the degradation rate was up to 38 %. By determining the 16 S sequence of CSUFTM 78 strain, the homology of GENBANK in BLAST reaches more than 99 % with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (HQ 185399). By constructing a phylogenetic tree, strain CSUFTM 78 and S. maltophilia were integrated into one with the confidence of 100 %. Combined with the morphological characteristics of strains, we identify the CSUFTM 78 as S. maltophilia and the results can provide both strains and theoretical basis for degrading the <b>acetochlor</b> residual in tobacco cultivated soil using microorganism...|$|E
