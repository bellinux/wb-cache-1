They were separated into subjects withsmall <b>ametropia</b> (mean sphere 3. 5 D hyperopia, > 3 D myopia). The agreement between both types of refractors regarding the different refractive components was assessed for the whole group and for the two subgroups of small and high <b>ametropia.</b> Part B. 48 infants were refracted under cycloplegia by retinoscopy and by the Retinomax(R). The agreement between both methods of refraction was analyzed {{in the same manner}} as in part A. RESULTS Part A. No significant bias was found between the two types of refractors with regard to the spherical equivalent. The 95 % limits of agreement were +/- 1 D. Although no clinically significant bias was found with regard to the cylinder power in the 276 subjects, it was found that the 95 % limits of agreement were much better (+/- 0. 75 D) in small <b>ametropia</b> subjects than in high <b>ametropia</b> subjects (- 2. 1 to + 1. 3 D). No significant bias was found with regard to the axis determination. Part B. No significant bias was found between the Retinomax(R) and retinoscopic measurements with regard to the spherical equivalent. The 95 % limits of agreement were - 1. 36 to + 1. 76 D. However, the mean difference for spheres and cylinders showed a positive bias and a negative bias, respectively, suggesting more positive spheres and larger cylinders when measured by the Retinomax(R) compared to retinoscopy. This was particularly obvious in cases of high <b>ametropia.</b> CONCLUSION Compared to retinoscopy and on-table autorefraction, the hand-held refractor Retinomax(R) is accurate in any <b>ametropia</b> with respect to the spherical equivalent.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} teaching {{on a group of}} naive observers asked to determine the cup-to-disc ratio of a series of stereo photographs presented by two different methods using custom software StereoDxT developed at Cardiff University. One method of presentation made use of Nvidia 3 D software and compatible hardware, while the other was a ‘low tech’ approach using red-cyan anaglyphs. In order to further inform the results of this study, the members of the glaucoma team at North Devon District Hospital (NDDH), consisting of ophthalmologists, optometrists and other staff, undertook a similar study. An experiment to examine the magnification factor of several different binocular indirect lenses routinely used in the glaucoma clinics was also undertaken. The study showed observers, following a training session with the more expensive presentation system, improved their performance relative to an expert observer, while those using anaglyph images returned equivocal results. Control observers’ performance remained the same throughout the study. When compared against qualified staff at NDDH it was found that generally naive observers could improve their ability to determine cup-to-disc ratios to a similar level of experienced practitioners. It is believed that the anaglyph approach could be a viable alternative to higher cost training ‘set ups’ provided images are carefully selected and produced in a controlled manner. Measurements of a simulated optic disc taken with the binocular indirect lenses at differing simulated <b>ametropias</b> and working distances were found to be inconsistent with all the lenses tested.

CONCLUSION:High cylinder of anisometropia may affect the choice of the dominant eye. High sphere of anisometropia {{may be the result of}} the choice of dominant eye...|$|E

The need is {{established}} for measuring pseudo-accommodation (the {{depth of focus}} of the eye) when a standard artificial or accommodative lens is implanted into the eye. It is specified the need for analyzing the impact of aberrations of a measuring device?s elements {{as well as the}} pupil?s diameter onto the accuracy of <b>ametropia</b> and pseudo-accommodation measurements by the method, proposed by the authors. In this study, a computer simulation is applied for an optical system of the measuring device and an ametropic eye with a diffuse-scattering retina. The optical system was simulated using paraxial and real aberrational components. The results of simulation have confirmed an insignificant effect of aberrations of the device?s actual components on <b>ametropia</b> measurement errors. The length of the focal region was estimated by using RMS spot diagrams of light microspots at the retina, formed by the optical system of the eye in the reverse ray path. The influence of reverse ray path on measurement errors of the eye?s <b>ametropia</b> and pseudo-accommodation has been found as negligible. It is also shown the dependence of a pseudo-accommodation volume on the pupil diameter for the eye having no accommodation function. ?????????? ??????????? ????????????? ????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????????????

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the peripheral refraction {{of children with}} different types of <b>ametropias</b> and to evaluate the relationship between central refractive changes, baseline relative peripheral refraction (RPR) and changes in RPR over a 12 -month monitoring period. Methods: Cycloplegic central and peripheral refraction were performed biannually on the right eyes of children aged 6 - 9 for 12 months, using an open-view autorefractor. Peripheral refraction were measured along 10 °, 20 ° and 30 ° from central fixation in both nasal and temporal fields. Refractive data were transposed into M, J 0 and J 45 vectors for analyses. RPR was determined by subtracting the central measurement from each peripheral measurement. Results: Hyperopic eyes showed relative peripheral myopia while myopic eyes had relative hyperopia across the central 60 ° horizontal field at baseline. Emmetropic eyes had relative myopia within but showed relative hyperopia beyond the central 30 ° field. However, {{there was no significant}} correlation between central refractive changes and baseline RPR or between changes in central refraction and RPR over twelve months in any refractive groups. Correlations between changes in PR and central myopic shift were found mainly in the nasal field in different groups. In the subgroup analysis on the initially emmetropic and the initially myopic groups, the subgroups with faster myopic progression did not have significantly different RPR from the subgroups with slower progression. The RPR pattern of the initially emmetropic and the initially myopic groups became more asymmetric {{at the end of the}} study period with a larger increase in relative hyperopia in the temporal field. Conclusions: RPR patterns were different among hyperopic, emmetropic and myopic eyes. However, baseline RPR and changes in RPR cannot predict changes in central refraction over time. Our results did not provide evidence to support the hypothesis of RPR as a causative factor for myopic central refractive changes in children. School of Optometr...|$|R
40|$|Excimer laser {{photorefractive keratectomy}} (PRK) has evolved to a widely {{performed}} procedure. The excimer laser corrects refractive <b>ametropias</b> by removing a calculated amount of anterior corneal stroma with great precision and with minimal {{damage to the}} adjacent tissues. The correction of myopia up to - 5. 00 diopters (D) with excimer laser ablation yields good results with 99 % of the final refractions within ± 1. 00 D of that intended. In some patients, however, the clinical practice faces problems like insufficient predictability in refractive outcome, haze and myopic regression in the postoperative course. Hyaluronan (HA) has been detected in the wound area after excimer laser surgery in the rabbit cornea {{as well as in}} a few human corneal specimens. In paper I we apply histochemical methods to confirm its presence in human corneas after excimer laser ablation. Hyaluronan in wound scrapings of corneas that had to be reoperated because of unsatisfactory outcome has been associated with aggressive myopic regression and with severe haze. Hyaluronan is capable of binding considerable amounts of water. In paper II we apply quantitative microradiography and histochemical HA staining to demonstrate its subepithelial colocalization with water in rabbit corneas postoperatively. The final result of excimer laser surgery depends on the ablation quality and on the individual corneal healing response to the treatment quality. Ablation depth, -diameter and -slope are variables that might affect reepithelialization and stromal healing after surgery. In paper III we utilize a modified planimetry to evaluate the healing reaction by measuring the subepithelial water accumulation. Our results suggest that a shallow slope causes less activity during the subsequent healing, when compared to a steep curve refractive treatment. Any departure from a smooth surface might degrade the optical qualities of the ablated cornea and thereby impair the clinical results. Paper IV provides information about the time course of stromal irregularities and their impact on wound healing as compared to a rather smooth postablational surface. Corticosteroids are still the primary therapeutical agent proposed to modulate the corneal healing response. Corticosteroids may influence the refractive result after PRK at least by two ways, one by reducing the postoperative epithelial thickness, the other by suppressing the subepithelial remodeling. Paper V addresses these issues and concludes that corticosteroids reduce subepithelial HA accumulation and prevent epithelial hyperplasia. By these means corticosteroids are likely to affect the refractive status of the cornea. In conclusion, we show that subepithelial HA is formed in human corneas after excimer laser surgery. In rabbits HA is demonstrated to colocalize with water in the subepithelial area. The planimetric evaluation of subepithelial water accumulation shows that a steep curve refractive treatment causes more healing reaction when compared to an ablation with shallow slope, this independently to treatment depth. The inflammatory response is more pronounced after a laser treatment leaving postablational surface irregularities, when compared to a laser treatment leaving a smooth postablational surface. Corticosteroids are shown to reduce subepithelial HA accumulation and prevent epithelial hyperplasia...|$|R
40|$|Se realizó un estudio acerca de los factores que influyen en que el desarrollo tecnológico de la cirugía refractiva en América Latina y el Caribe no sea accesible a todos, a pesar de la alta cifra de pacientes con limitación visual por <b>ametropías</b> no corregidas. Esto provoca discriminación o exclusión social. Se hizo una revisión documental en Internet sobre los avances tecnológicos en esta subespecialidad y sus consecuencias, con el objetivo de analizar la posible causa de esta problemática y conocer qué pueden hacer o ya están haciendo los países de nuestro continente -incluso en Cuba- para combatirlo y mejorar así la calidad de vida de la población latinoamericana. Podemos concluir que tiene una génesis social, y que se destacan los factores que la han agravado como son la privatización de la salud, violaciones éticas y de la relación médico-paciente, gobiernos que no dan prioridad a la salud y políticas sanitarias que no benefician a la población necesitada, entre otros. Es necesario que los países latinoamericanos consideren la discapacidad visual como una prioridad, destinen recursos {{para ello}} y apliquen tecnologías apropiadas en correspondencia con sus posibilidades tecnológicas nacionales, contexto social, económico, político y cultural. Cuba, por el contrario, demuestra que puede ser posible que la ciencia y la tecnología en su más alta expresión lleguen a todos, incluido a las hermanas naciones del continente con la Misión Milagro; así se da solución a un grave problema de salud que afecta a la sociedad. A study about the factors {{determining}} the limited access {{of the people}} to the technological development of the Refractive Surgery in Latin America and the Caribbean, in spite of the high number of patients with visual limitation for not corrected ametropy. This causes discrimination or social exclusion. A document review was made on Internet on the technological advances in this subspecialty and its consequences, with the objective of analyzing the possible cause of this problem and finding out what the countries in our continent -including our own nation- can do or are doing to face it and {{to improve the quality of}} life of the Latin American population. We may conclude that this situation has a social origin, with factors that have aggravated the problem such as the health care privatization, violations in ethics and the physician-patient relationship, there are some governments that do not give priority to the health care and several health policies that do not encourage benefits for the needy people, among others. It is necessary that the Latin American countries consider the visual disability as a priority, allocate resources for its treatment and apply appropriate technologies according to their national technological capabilities and their social, economic, political and cultural context. By contrast, Cuba has proven that it is possible for science and the technology at its highest level to reach everybody, including he sisters nations of the continent through the Miracle Mission, thus solving a serious health problem having an impact on the society...|$|R
