40|$|In this dissertation, joint detection-state {{estimation}} {{and secure}} signal processing are studied. Detection and state estimation are two important research topics in surveillance systems. The detection problems investigated in this dissertation include object detection and fault detection. The goal of object detection {{is to determine}} {{the presence or absence of}} an object under measurement uncertainty. The aim of fault detection is to determine whether or not the measurements are provided by faulty sensors. State estimation is to estimate the states of moving objects from measurements with random measurement noise or disturbance, which typically consist of their positions and velocities over time. Detection and state estimation are typically implemented separately and state estimation is usually performed after the decision is made. In this two-stage approach, missed detection and false alarms in detection stage decrease accuracy of state estimation. In this dissertation, several joint detection and state estimation algorithms are proposed. Secure signal processing is indispensable in dynamic systems especially when an adversary exists. In this dissertation, the developed joint fault detection and state estimation approach is used to detect attacks launched by an adversary on the system and improve state estimation accuracy. The security problem in satellite communication systems is studied and a minimax <b>anti-jammer</b> is designed in a frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) /quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) satellite communication system...|$|E
