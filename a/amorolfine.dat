Nevertheless, reports on T. rubrum resistance to commonly used antifungal drugs are rare. In this study, we compared the in vitro resistance frequen-cies and development of resistance to terbinafine, itraconazole, <b>amorolfine,</b> and ciclopirox in T. rubrum. Results demonstrated that naturally occurring mutants were isolated at a frequency of 107 for itraconazole and 109 for terbinafine and <b>amorolfine.</b> To mimic conditions of body sites in which low drug levels are reached during therapy, T. rubrumwas propagated for 10 trans-fers in media containing subinhibitory drug concentrations. Resistance to itraconazole, terbinafine, and <b>amorolfine</b> emerged at a higher frequency than was seen with spontaneous mutation. Itraconazole-resistant mutants also showed decreased susceptibility to <b>amorolfine</b> as well as to terbinafine, and amorolfine-resistant mutants were also less susceptible to terbinafine.

Aims: To assess the effectivity and safety of <b>amorolfine</b> 0. 25 % cream in patients with tinea corporis, in comparison to clotrimazole 1 % cream. Materials and Methods: Patients presenting with symptoms of tinea corporis were mycologically confirmed {{for the presence of}} fungal hyphae.

40|$|Combination {{therapy is}} one way of {{improving}} the cure rate of onychomycosis. The LION Study examined the efficacies of terbinafine and itraconazole. The Icelandic cohort of the study reported that after 5 years only 46 % of the terbinafine-treated patients and 13 % of the itraconazole-treated patients were still disease-free, suggesting that relapses and reinfections were common in the long term treatment of onychomycosis with monotherapy. Combination therapy is a well-established principle in mycology; the current strategy involves the combination of oral and topical antifungal treatments. A number of specific drug combinations have proved to be useful in the treatment of onychomycosis: tioconazole and griseofulvin, <b>amorolfine</b> and griseofulvin, <b>amorolfine</b> and terbinafine, and <b>amorolfine</b> and itraconazole. However, comparison of the combination trials can be difficult because of the short duration of some of the studies and variation in global cure rates. Although it is necessary to consider these factors it is clear that combination therapy offers advantages when compared with monotherapy.

40|$|Onychomycosis is {{a common}} fungal nail disease that is {{difficult}} to treat topically due to the deep location of the infection under the densely keratinized nail plate. Keratin affinity of topical drugs is an important physicochemical property impacting thera-peutic efficacy. To be effective, topical drugs must penetrate the nail bed and retain their antifungal activity within the nail ma-trix, both of which are adversely affected by keratin binding. We investigated these properties for efinaconazole, a new topical antifungal for onychomycosis, compared with those of the existing topical drugs ciclopirox and <b>amorolfine.</b> The efinaconazole free-drug concentration in keratin suspensions was 14. 3 %, significantly higher than the concentrations of ciclopirox and amo-rolfine, which were 0. 7 % and 1. 9 %, respectively (P< 0. 001). Efinaconazole was released from keratin at a higher proportion than in the reference drugs, with about half of the remaining keratin-bound efinaconazole removed after washing. In single-dose in vitro studies, efinaconazole penetrated full-thickness human nails into the receptor phase and also inhibited the growth of Trichophyton rubrum under the nail. In the presence of keratin, efinaconazole exhibited fungicidal activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes comparable to that of <b>amorolfine</b> and superior to that of ciclopirox. In a guinea pig onychomycosis model with T. mentagrophytes infection, an efinaconazole solution significantly decreased nail fungal burden compared to that of ciclopirox and <b>amorolfine</b> lacquers (P< 0. 01). These results suggest that the high nail permeability of efinaconazole and its potent fungi-cidal activity in the presence of keratin are related to its low keratin affinity, which may contribute to its efficacy in onychomycosis...|$|E

One percent solution (0. 1 ml) of KP- 103, <b>amorolfine,</b> or terbinafine was topically applied to the nails and whole sole of an infected foot once daily for 30 consecutive days, and terbinafine was also orally administered at a daily dose of 40 mg/kg of body weight for 30 consecutive days, starting on day 60 postinfection. The fungal burdens of nails and plantar skin were assessed using a new method, which {{makes it possible to}} recover infecting fungi by removing a carryover of the drug remaining in the treated tissues into the culture medium. Topically applied KP- 103 inhibited the development of nail collapse, significantly reduced the fungal burden of the nails, and sterilized the infected plantar skin. On the other hand, topical <b>amorolfine</b> and topical or oral terbinafine were ineffective for tinea unguium, although these drugs eradicated or reduced the fungal burden of plantar skin. The in vitro activities of <b>amorolfine</b> and terbinafine against T. mentagrophytes SM- 110 were 8 - and 32 -fold, respectively, decreased by the addition of 5 % keratin to Sabouraud dextrose broth medium. In contrast, the activity of KP- 103 was not affected by keratin because its keratin affinity is lower than those of the reference drugs, suggesting that KP- 103 largely exists in the nails as an active form that was not bound to keratin and diffuses in the nail without being trapped by keratin. The effectiveness of KP- 103 against tinea unguium is probably due to its favorable pharmacokinetic properties in the nails together with its potent antifungal activity...|$|E

Our aim {{was to investigate the}} potential of UV-curable gels – currently used as cosmetics – as topical drug carriers for their treatment. These formulations have a long residence on the nail, which is expected to increase patient compliance and the success of topical therapy. The gels are composed of the diurethane dimethacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, 2 -hydroxy- 2 -methylpropiophenone, an antifungal drug (<b>amorolfine</b> HCl or terbinafine HCl) and an organic liquid (ethanol or NMP) as drug solvent. Following its application to a substrate and exposure to a UVA lamp for 2 min, the gel polymerises and forms a smooth, glossy and amorphous film, with negligible levels of residual monomers. No drug-polymer interactions were found and drug loading did not affect the film’s properties, such as thickness, crystallinity and transition temperatures. In contrast, the organic solvent did influence the film’s properties; NMP-containing films had lower glass transition temperatures, adhesion and water resistance than ethanol-based ones. Water-resistance being a desired property, ethanol-based formulations were investigated further for stability, drug release and ungual permeation. The films were stable under accelerated stability testing conditions. Compared to terbinafine, <b>amorolfine</b> was released to a greater extent, had a higher ungual flux, but a lower concentration in the nailplate.

Repetition of the experiments at four different temperatures with 99 C. albicans isolates and five antifungal agents confirmed a direct relationship between growth inhibition and increasing temperature from 25 to 40 degrees C with amphotericin B, flucytosine, and terconazole; a strong inverse relationship between inhibition and temperature with amorolfine; and a weak inverse relationship with terbinafine.

Methods (1) Test isolates included 5 clinical isolates each (3 suscep- tible and 2 resistant strains where possible) of yeasts (Candida albi- cans, C. glabrata, C. parapsislosis, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans), moulds (Fusarium solani, Aspergillus fla- vus, A. fumigatus, A. niger, A. terreus, Pseudallescheria boydii, Scopulari- opsis brevicaulis, Scedosporium spp., S. prolificans, Cunninghamella bertholletiae, Rizopus oryzae, Mucor plumbeus, M. fragilis) and dermato- phytes (Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton flocco- sum, Microsporum canis). MIC testing was performed according to the CLSI M 27 -A 3 and M 38 -A 2 standards for the susceptibility testing of yeasts and filamentous fungi, respectively. (2) The frequency of spon- taneous resistance of 3 T. rubrum strains was evaluated by counting the number of colonies obtained following incubation of agar plates inoculated with a total of about 109 CFU on agar plates containing drug concentrations higher than the minimal fungicidal concentra- tion; the evolution of resistance was evaluated in 2 T. rubrum strains serially propagated for 10 transfers on agar plates containing sub- inhibitory drug concentrations. After the 5 th and the 10 th transfer, colonies were transferred on plates containing inhibitory drug con- centrations and assessed for growth following incubation. Results (1) The in vitro susceptibility of the tested strains to P- 27530 was as follows: Yeasts P- 27530 MIC range of 0. 06 â€“ 1 lg/ml was recorded, following 24 hours incubation, for all yeasts but sev- eral C. glabrata isolates which were read at 48 hours (MIC range of 0. 06 â€“ 2 lg/ml). P- 27530 performed similarly against both Candida susceptible strains and strains resistant to caspofungin, fluconazole, miconazole, and voriconazole. Slightly reduced activity was observed against Cryptococcus neoformans with a MIC range of 2 â€“ 4 lg/ml. Moulds P- 27530 performed similarly against the suscepti- ble strains and the strains with elevated MICs to amphotericin B, caspofungin, itraconazole, and miconazole with a MIC range of 0. 06 â€“ 2 lg/ml. Dermatophytes P- 27530 demonstrated similar activ- ity against the isolates (range of 0. 25 â€“ 2 lg/ml) and performed simi- larly (within one dilution) against both susceptible and resistant (terbinafine and fluconazole) T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes strains. (2) no spontaneous resistant mutant to P- 27530 and CPX was isolated; resistance frequency was 107 ̆f 7 for itraconazole and 107 ̆f 9 for terbinafine and <b>amorolfine.</b> All mutants collected con- firmed the loss of susceptibility. P- 27530 and CPX did not induce any resistance; frequency was 107 ̆f 5 for itraconazole and 107 ̆f 7 for terbinafine and <b>amorolfine.</b> In both experiments itraconazole resis- tant mutants showed increased resistance also to <b>amorolfine</b> and terbinafine.

In order to obtain an in vitro index that is relevant to the clinical efficacy of topical anti-onychomycosis drugs, we profiled five topical drugs: <b>amorolfine,</b> ciclopirox, efinaconazole, luliconazole, and terbinafine, for their nail permeabilities, keratin affinities, and anti-dermatophytic activities {{in the presence of}} keratin. Efinaconazole and ciclopirox permeated full-thickness human nails more deeply than luliconazole. <b>Amorolfine</b> and terbinafine did not show any detectable permeation. The free-drug concentration of efinaconazole in a 5 % human nail keratin suspension was 24. 9 %, which was significantly higher than those of the other drugs (1. 1 - 3. 9 %). Additionally, efinaconazole was released from human nail keratin at a greater proportion than the other drugs. The MICs of the five drugs for Trichophyton rubrum were determined at various concentrations of keratin (0 - 20 %) in RPMI 1640 medium. The MICs of ciclopirox were not affected by keratin, whereas those of efinaconazole were slightly increased and those of luliconazole and terbinafine were markedly increased in the presence of 20 % keratin. Efficacy coefficients were calculated using the nail permeation flux and MIC in media without or with keratin. Efinaconazole showed the highest efficacy coefficient, which was determined using MIC in media with keratin. The order of efficacy coefficients determined using MIC in keratin-containing media rather than keratin-free media was consistent with that of complete cure rates in previously reported clinical trials. The present study revealed that efficacy coefficients determined using MIC in keratin-containing media are useful for predicting the clinical efficacies of topical drugs.

40|$|AbstractThe {{treatment}} of onychomycosis remains problematic {{even though there}} are several potent antifungal agents available for patient use. The aim of this investigation was to understand whether the structural modifications that arise when a patient’s nail become infected plates influences the permeation of drugs into the nail following topical application. It was hoped that through improving understanding of the nail barrier in the diseased state, the development of more effective topical treatments for onychomycosis could be facilitated. The permeation of three compounds with differing hydrophobicities, caffeine, terbinafine and <b>amorolfine</b> (clogD at pH 7. 4 of − 0. 55, 3. 72 and 4. 49 respectively), was assessed across both healthy and onychomycosis infected, full thickness, human nail plate sections. Transonychial water loss (TOWL) measurements performed on the healthy and diseased nails supported previous observations that the nail behaves like a porous barrier given the lack of correlation between TOWL values with the thicker, diseased nails. The flux of the more hydrophilic caffeine was twofold greater across diseased in comparison with the healthy nails, whilst the hydrophobic molecules terbinafine and <b>amorolfine</b> showed no statistically significant change in their nail penetration rates. Caffeine flux across the nail was found to correlate with the TOWL measurements, though no correlation existed for the more hydrophobic drugs.

The aim of this investigation was to understand if the structural modifications that arise when a patient's nail become infected plates influences the permeation of drugs into the nail following topical application. It was hoped that through improving understanding of the nail barrier in the diseased state, the development of more effective topical treatments for onychomycosis could be facilitated. The permeation of three compounds with differing hydrophobicities; caffeine, terbinafine and <b>amorolfine,</b> (clogD at pH 7. 4 of - 0. 55, 3. 72 and 4. 49 respectively), was assessed across both healthy and onychomycosis infected, full thickness, human nail plate sections. Transonychial water loss (TOWL) measurements performed on the healthy and diseased nails supported previous observations that the nail behaves like a porous barrier given the lack of correlation between TOWL values with the thicker, diseased nails. The flux of the more hydrophilic caffeine was two-fold greater across diseased in comparison to the healthy nails, whilst the hydrophobic molecules terbinafine and <b>amorolfine</b> showed no statistically significant change in their nail penetration rates. Caffeine flux across the nail was found to correlate with the TOWL measurements, though no correlation existed for the more hydrophobic drugs. This data supported the notion that the nail pores, opened up by the infection, facilitated the passage of hydrophilic molecules, whilst the keratin binding of hydrophobic molecules meant that their transport through the nail plate was unchanged. Therefore, in order to exploit the structural changes induced by nail fungal infection it would be beneficial to develop a small molecular weight, hydrophilic antifungal agent, which exhibits low levels of keratin binding...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} drugs in {{combination}} on the growth of Candida glabrata was studied in solid medium by demonstration of reduced or enhanced growth, and in liquid medium by determination of interaction indices. Amphotericin B and 5 -fluorocytosine showed a synergic effect, while combinations of amphotericin B and miconazole, and miconazole and 5 -fluorocytosine exhibited antagonistic effects. In addition, concentration-dependent antagonism was observed amongst combinations of metabolic inhibitors, between inhibitors of sterol biosynthesis (terbinafine, miconazole, ketoconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and <b>amorolfine)</b> and inhibitors of nucleic acid or protein biosynthesis (5 -fluorocytosine, 5 -fluorouracil, rifampicin and chlortetracycline). This antagonism was strain-specific, occurring with C. glabrata strain 4, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain 237 and Candida albicans strain 72 R, but not with C. albicans strain 6406 or Candida parapsilosis strain 3104. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Denture {{stomatitis}} (DS) is {{an inflammatory}} lesion, {{in which there}} is redness of the oral mucosa underneath a removable denture. Although Candida albicans is a component of normal microbial flora, local and systemic factors can cause opportunistic infections. Poorly fitting or unhygienic dentures leads to the presence of yeasts attached to it., and cause inflammation. Treatment procedures include correction of ill-fitting dentures, plaque control, and topical and systemic antifungal therapy. Nystatin and Amphoteresin B are used topically as suspension. Since candidiasis is highly resistant to antifungal agents, systemic usage of ketoconazole, fluconazole or itraconazole are necessary. But the systemic use of these drugs can cause side effects like liver toxicity, drug interactions etc. Lucio; Lorengo etal had conducted a study of the efficacy of <b>amorolfine</b> antifungal varnish, by local application, and found that it suppresses the nystatin resistant Candida associated denture stomatitis...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{improvements}} in antifungal strategies, {{the outcome of}} treating onychomycoses often remains uncertain. Several factors account for treatment failure, of which the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the antifungal are of importance. The taxonomic nature and ungual location of the fungus cannot be neglected, besides the type of nail and its growth rate. In addition, the biological cycle of the fungus and the metabolic activity of the pathogen likely play a marked influence in drug response. The presence of natural antimicrobial peptides in the nail is also probably a key feature controlling the cure rates. There are many outstanding publications that cover {{the full spectrum of}} the field. The purpose of this review is to put in perspective some facets of activity of the topical treatment using <b>amorolfine</b> nail laquer. The antifungal activity of the drug is likely less pronounced in onychomycosis than that expected from conventional in vitro studies. However, the nail laquer formulation should reduce the propensity to form antifungal-resistant spores and limit the risk of reinfection. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Fungal {{infections are}} {{reported}} to cause 23 % of foot diseases and 50 % of nail conditions in people seen by dermatologists, but are less common in the general population, affecting 3 % to 12 % of people. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed {{to answer the following}} clinical questions: What are the effects of oral treatments for fungal toenail infections in adults? What are the effects of topical treatments for fungal toenail infections in adults? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: <b>amorolfine,</b> butenafine, ciclopirox, fluconazole, itraconazole, terbinafine, tioconazole, and topical ketoconazole...|$|E
40|$|Onychomycosis (fungal nail infection) {{is caused}} by three groups of fungal {{pathogens}} namely dermatophyte molds (DM), non-DM (NDM) and yeasts. It is primarily a cosmetic problem but may induce impact on quality of life. Clinically it is characterized by five morphologically distinctive types; distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO), superficial white onychomycosis (SWO), proximal subungual onychomycosis (PSO), and endothrix onychomycosis. It is difficult to detect the fungal agent responsible for {{a particular type of}} onychomycosis by clinical features alone. Mycological methods like direct demonstration of fungal agents by potassium hydroxide mount or nail plate histopathology with Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining are sensitive methods for the detection of pathogens. Fungal culture alone is commonly used as a standard for the detection of etiological agent. Molecular biological techniques are currently used only in research laboratories or epidemiological purposes. Therapy is generally not satisfactory. Both topical and systemic agents are used in the therapy. Topical Ciclopirix and <b>Amorolfine</b> are found to be effective but only in early and limited disease. Terbinafine and Itraconazole seems to be the best drugs for the systemic therapy. Clinical cure rates are generally lower than the mycological cure rates...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{pre-requisite}} for {{a successful}} topical antifungal drug indicated for onychomycosis is its bioavailability into the nail unit for achieving fungal eradication and clinical benefit. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare in vitro permeation/penetration through and into human nails of <b>amorolfine</b> (MRF) from a 5 % anhydrous commercial formulation (Loceryl®) and ciclopirox (CPX) from the 8 % aqueous formulation in hydroxypropyl chitosan (HPCH) technology (Onytec®). The ability of the active ingredient to reach efficacious concentrations to inhibit nail pathogens was also evaluated. The amounts of drug permeated and retained in human healthy nails were determined using a suitably modified diffusion apparatus. HPLC analysis of the samples was performed. The HPCH-based CPX formulation demonstrated an efficient penetration into and permeation through the nail plates. Conversely, Loceryl® produced an amount of MRF permeated through and penetrated into the human toenails significantly lower than CPX. The evaluation of the efficacy index showed a higher potential efficacy of Onytec® with respect to Loceryl® on nail pathogens. The present work not only reinforced the previous results on different experimental substrates, but pointed out the superiority of HPCH-based Onytec® formulation containing CPX with respect to Loceryl® commercial product with MRF, both in terms of higher permeation through and penetration into the human nail, and for the efficacy towards the most common ungual pathogens...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{hypothesised}} that Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSPs) {{can be used}} {{to predict}} drug–nail affinities. Our aims were to: (i) determine the HSPs (δD, δP, δH) of the nail plate, the hoof membrane (a model for the nail plate), and of the drugs terbinafine HCl, <b>amorolfine</b> HCl, ciclopirox olamine and efinaconazole, by measuring their swelling/solubility in organic liquids, (ii) predict nail–drug interactions by comparing drug and nail HSPs, and (iii) evaluate the accuracy of these predictions using literature reports of experimentally-determined affinities of these drugs for keratin, the main constituent of the nail plate and hoof. Many solvents caused no change in the mass of nail plates, a few solvents deswelled the nail, while others swelled the nail to varying extents. Fingernail and toenail HSPs were almost the same, while hoof HSPs were similar, except for a slightly lower δP. High nail–terbinafine HCl, nail–amorolfine HCl and nail–ciclopirox olamine affinities, and low nail–efinaconazole affinities were then predicted, and found to accurately match experimental reports of these drugs’ affinities to keratin. We therefore propose that drug and nail Hansen Solubility Parameters may be used to predict drug–nail interactions, and that these results can assist in the design of drugs for the treatment of nail diseases, such as onychomycosis and psoriasis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the application of HSPs in ungual research...|$|E
40|$|<b>Amorolfine</b> (AOF) is a {{compound}} with fungicide activity {{based on the}} dual inhibition of growth of the fungal cell membrane, the biosynthesis and accumulation of sterols, and the reduction of ergosterol. In this work a sensitive kinetic and spectrophotometric method for the AOF quantitation based on the AOF oxidation by means of KMnO 4 at 30 [*]min (fixed time), pH alkaline, and ionic strength controlled was developed. Measurements of changes in absorbance at 610 [*]nm were used as criterion of the oxidation progress. In order to maximize the sensitivity, different experimental reaction parameters were carefully studied via factorial screening and optimized by multivariate method. The linearity, intraday, and interday assay precision and accuracy were determined. The absorbance-concentration plot corresponding to tap water spiked samples was rectilinear, over the range of 7. 56 × 10 − 6 – 3. 22 × 10 − 5 [*]mol[*]L− 1, with detection and quantitation limits of 2. 49 × 10 − 6 [*]mol[*]L− 1 and 7. 56 × 10 − 6 [*]mol[*]L− 1, respectively. The proposed method was successfully validated {{for the application of}} the determination of the drug in the spiked tap water samples and the percentage recoveries were 94. 0 – 105. 0 %.

40|$|The LightCycler system (two-step reverse transcription-PCR–fluorescent {{hybridization}} [LC RT-PCR–FH]) {{was used}} to quantify Candida albicans actin mRNA {{as a means of}} assessing its viability in a reconstituted skin model of cutaneous candidiasis following the application of an antimycotic. A 192 -bp ACT exon fragment was ligated into the pCR 2. 1 plasmid vector, and dilutions of the cloned insert (pACT; 4. 092 kb) were used as the standard reference template. The LC RT-PCR–FH system could detect 1 fg of pACT, equivalent to 2. 2 copies of the plasmid. The ACT exon-based PCR primers and FH probes were C. albicans specific, and electrophoretic analysis of the LC RT-PCR–FH assay product showed a 174 -bp band in agarose gel. The number of copies of C. albicans ACT mRNA per milligram of tissue decreased with increasing amounts of <b>amorolfine</b> applied to a C. albicans-infected skin model, showing a reduction in viability. Detection and quantification of ACT mRNA in tissue by the LC RT-PCR–FH assay corresponded with cultural isolation of C. albicans from samples. The ACT mRNA-targeted LC RT-PCR–FH assay represents a sensitive, specific, rapid, and quantitative means of assessing the viability of C. albicans in infected tissue. This method may also be useful in evaluating the therapeutic efficacies of antifungal drugs in the treatment of various forms of candidiasis and other fungal diseases...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} growth (percentage {{of growth}} relative to control growth) of 496 isolates representing six Candida species was assessed {{as a means}} of determining in vitro susceptibilities of the isolates in microdilution plate wells containing single concentrations of each of seven antifungal agents. The relative growth data were highly reproducible. With flucytosine and <b>amorolfine</b> they correlated well with MICs, but for an azole antifungal agent, terconazole, they did not correlate with MICs. Distributions of relative growth percentages for different Candida spp. showed significant differences in species susceptibility to individual agents. For example, C. albicans was less susceptible than the other species to amorolfine; C. parapsilosis isolates were particularly susceptible to terbinafine; and C. glabrata, C. guiliermondii, and C. krusei isolates were less susceptible than C. albicans to fluconazole and ketoconazole but equally susceptible as or more susceptible than C. albicans to itraconazole. Differential patterns of susceptibility to individual azole antifungal agents were noted for some individual strains as well as for Candida spp. Yeast susceptibility testing with imidazole- and triazole-derivative antifungal agents remains a controversial issue. While efforts to standardize tests with amphotericin B and flucytosine have led to MIC test protocols that give good interlaboratory reproducibility (25), the same is not yet true for imidazole and triazole compounds, for which most au-thors consider MIC tests to lack reliability because their outcome depends too heavily on variable experimental con-ditions such as medium composition, pH, temperature, an...|$|E
