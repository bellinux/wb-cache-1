He added, [...] "Sure, games can get away from you in the seventh and eighth, but those last three outs in the ninth are the toughest. You want the guy who can handle that pressure. That, to me, is most important." [...] Oakland general manager Billy Beane said there would be too much media criticism if a pitcher other than the closer lost the game in the ninth." [...] Managerial moves are immediately questioned with millions of fans having access to ESPN, the MLB Network, and other cable channels. Former manager Jim Fregosi said managers do not like to be second-guessed. [...] "Even if you know the odds, it's more comfortable being wrong {{when you go to the}} closer", said Beane.

[...] Baseball announcer Chris Wheeler noted that there is pressure on managers to pitch closers in the ninth inning when they were paid big money to pitch in that role. Former general manager Pat Gillick said closers become one-inning pitchers as managers began copying the practice of having setup pitchers enter before closers.

50|$|There {{is also a}} no fail {{policy in}} Thailand and often in most schools a {{multiple}} choice marking. This can be for many reasons, such as there <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> students in the classroom, and so teachers feel {{no choice but to}} employ multiple choice marking. But even in private schools this can be the case. Few students are taught to read and write on any great level. Thai also as a language does not have any or many spaces or fullstops, and so for students to use them is even a challenge. This added to the feeling that students should not be embarrassed or made to feel bad in the classroom means that many do not understand the importance of trying, getting it wrong and learning from their mistakes. Parents often castigate foreign teachers when their children fare badly and blame the teacher, and so there is little incentive to try and for them to learn complex reading and writing. Instead most of the emphasis is on grammar which few understand or appreciate the importance of it. Because Thai is so different, they feel Thai is easier and rarely do they speak English outside of their lesson.|$|E

Critic Will Greenwald commented that [...] "It isn't a must-watch, and doesn't {{stand out as}} memorable or terrible, but it's enjoyable enough to at least feel like Hitman... The premise feels like The Professional... And, as stupid as that all sounds, it's {{actually}} very loosely {{the plot of the}} first Hitman game, Hitman: Codename 47... the first hour the film feels like a bizarre take on The Terminator. The action is frantic and creative. Gunplay feels a bit like Equilibrium, which means it's eye-catching, brutal, and incredibly unrealistic... and it's entertaining despite not feeling as genuine and harsh as the action in Dredd or John Wick... I liked Hitman: Agent 47, but it's not a very good movie. It's uneven and weird, and while it's much more enjoyable than the previous Hitman film, it doesn't leave a very lasting impression. It's not Hitman boring and it's not Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li bad or faithless to the source material, but it isn't consistently as strong as it could have been with a bit more logic in the writing and much less reliance on CG and film speed trickery to make the fights seem flashier (and faker).

50|$|With the {{establishment}} of Communist rule in Bulgaria after WWII, significant changes took place affecting all leading clubs without exception.

An important issue about the merger of these two teams, and the claims by Cherno More supporters who descend from them, is that it was not as a result of bankruptcy, insolvency, bad debts or any other foul play, but the result of a decision by a political party which had absolute and unchecked power, which simply decided that there <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> clubs in the city of Varna and that their number should be reduced.|$|R

5000|$|Ben Witherington {{sees the}} concept of {{election}} being inter-connected with the concepts of predestination and perseverance.

500|$|Another {{suggestion}} is that the Cheyenne warriors, pressed to recount details of the Custer battle, were still reluctant to admit to killing soldiers for fear of punishment.
