5|$|Solar {{radiation}} is <b>absorbed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% {{of the globe}} – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti-cyclones. Sunlight <b>absorbed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14°C. By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.|$|E
5|$|The {{index of}} refraction, a number used in physics to {{describe}} how light propagates through a particular substance, is an important property of volcanic ash. This number is complex having both real and imaginary parts, the real part indicating how light disperses and the imaginary part indicating how light is <b>absorbed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> substance.|$|E

5|$|Ultraviolet telescopes make {{observations}} at ultraviolet wavelengths, i.e. between approximately 10 and 320 nm. Light {{at these}} wavelengths is <b>absorbed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Earth's atmosphere, so observations at these wavelengths must be performed {{from the upper}} atmosphere or from space. Objects emitting ultraviolet radiation include the Sun, other stars and galaxies.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area moved to the west off the Burmese coast on July 5 and developed into a depression {{the next day in}} the north central Bay of Bengal. The depression intensified as it moved to the northwest, becoming a deep depression on July 7. The system made landfall on the Orissa coast during the morning of July 8 and rapidly degenerated into a broad area of {{low pressure}} overland. The remnant low moved north over western Bihar and it persisted there until July 12 when it was <b>absorbed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> monsoon trough.|$|E
5|$|After {{the school}} closed in 1953, the larger, {{original}} room was {{converted into a}} bus garage by the Chana School District. A large garage door was cut into {{the building and the}} floor completely removed. The smaller, 1893 room became a storage area. In 1962, the Chana School District ran out of room and used the building as an overflow classroom. By the mid-1960s, the Chana District folded and was <b>absorbed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Oregon School District. Residents were allowed to remove any items from the school after the district shut down.|$|E

5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{introduces}} a new ability system, Tactical Soul system, to the Castlevania series. It involves absorbing {{the souls of}} enemies {{in order to gain}} additional abilities. Except for human enemies and the game's final opponent, all souls can be <b>absorbed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> player. The rate at which enemies' souls are obtained varies between enemies. Players can trade souls between two Aria of Sorrow cartridges using two Game Boy Advance consoles and a link cable.|$|E
5|$|Being a hunt-driven dog, the Jack Russell {{will usually}} pursue most creatures that it encounters. This {{includes}} the skunk, and the breed {{is prone to}} skunk toxic shock syndrome. The chemical in the skunk spray is <b>absorbed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> dog and causes the red blood cells to undergo haemolysis, which can occasionally lead to fatal anaemia and kidney failure. If sprayed underground, it can also cause chemical burning of the cornea. Treatments are available to flush the toxin out of the dog's system.|$|E
5|$|Binghamton University was {{established}} in 1946 as Triple Cities College, to {{serve the needs of}} local veterans of the Binghamton, New York area, who were returning from World War II. Established in Endicott, New York, the college was a branch of Syracuse University. Triple Cities College offered local students {{the first two years of}} their education, while the following two were spent at Syracuse University. In 1946, students could earn their degrees entirely at the Binghamton campus. In 1950, it was <b>absorbed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> State University of New York and renamed Harpur College.|$|E

30|$|By 6 June 2011, {{what used}} to be a 750 km {{administrative}} border between the two neighbouring communities has turned into an international political border - a reality which has proven hard to <b>absorb</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pastoralists across both sides of the divide. On one hand, both governments, due to the mutual hostility and mistrust, wanted all types of relationships and activities to come to a halt. On the other hand, patterns of livelihood across the river could not be expected to change overnight as a consequence of the emerging new political realities.|$|R

5|$|Cleveland won the AAFC {{championship}} {{in each of}} the following three years before the league dissolved and the Browns were <b>absorbed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> NFL. Rymkus was named to all-AAFC teams in 1947, 1948, and 1949. In 1948, when the Browns won all of their games, Brown took away Rymkus's defensive duties and made him exclusively an offensive tackle. That summer, he served as an umpire in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.|$|E
5|$|Electrons can {{transfer}} between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy {{that matches the}} difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect. To escape the atom, {{the energy of the}} electron must be increased above its binding energy to the atom. This occurs, for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy is <b>absorbed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> electron.|$|E
5|$|Gamma ray {{astronomy}} observes astronomical objects at {{the shortest}} wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The Cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are <b>absorbed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Groundwater {{levels have}} been dropping, to varying degrees, {{in many areas}} of the city, due in part to an {{increase}} in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than <b>absorbed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ground. A city agency, the Boston Groundwater Trust, coordinates monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells. However, Boston's drinking water supply, from the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs to the west, is one of the very few in the country so pure as to satisfy federal water quality standards without filtration.|$|E
5|$|However, cooler waters {{eventually}} {{caught up}} to Humberto and it began to weaken once again early on August 31 as it tracked into the north Atlantic. That afternoon, Humberto weakened to a tropical storm as its circulation became embedded into a circulation of a nearby extratropical low in a high-shear environment. It continued to weaken that evening, and early on September 1, the tropical storm was <b>absorbed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> larger system.|$|E
