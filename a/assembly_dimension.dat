A dimension variation model was developed based on thermal stress prediction with {{finite element analysis}} (FEA).

By introducing the material modification coefficient, this comprehensive model can account for various fiber/resin types and stacking sequences. The regression-based dimension variation model can significantly reduce computation time by eliminating the complicated, time-consuming finite element meshing, material parameter defining and evaluation solving process, which provides a quick design guide for composite products with reduced dimension variations.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Tolerance {{analysis}} {{is a major}} link between design and manufacturing. An assembly or a part should be designed based on its functions, manufacturing processes, desired product quality, and manufacturing cost. Assembly tolerance analysis performed {{at the design stage}} can reduce potential manufacturing and assembly problems. Several commonly used assembly tolerance analysis models and their limitations are reviewed in this research. Also, a new assembly tolerance analysis model is developed to improve the limitations of the existing assembly tolerance analysis models. The new model elucidates the impact of the flatness symbol (one of the Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) specification symbols) and reduces design variables into simple mathematical equations. The new model is based on beta distribution of part dimensions. In addition, a group of manufacturing variables, including quality factor, process tolerance, and mean shift, is integrated in the new assembly tolerance analysis model. A computer integrated system has been developed to handle four support systems for the performance of tolerance analysis in a single computer application. These support systems are: 1) the CAD drawing system, 2) the Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) specification system, 3) the assembly tolerance analysis model, and 4) the tolerance database operating under the Windows environment. Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is applied to exchange the data between two different window applications, resulting in improvement of information transfer between the support systems.

40|$|One of {{the ways}} to lower the cost of nuclear energy is to {{increase}} the power density of the reactor core. Features of fuel design that enhance the potential for high power density are derived based on characteristics of the pressurized water reactor (PWR) and its related design limits. Those features include: large fuel surface to volume ratio, small fuel thickness, large fuel rod stiffness, low core pressure drop and an open fuel lattice design. Three types of fuel designs are evaluated from the thermal-hydraulic point of view: conventional solid cylindrical fuel rods, internally and externally cooled annular fuel rods, and spiral cross-geometry fuel rods, with the major effort allocated to analyzing the annular fuel. Limits of acceptable power density in solid cylindrical fuel rods are obtained by examining the effects of changing the core operation parameters, fuel rod diameter and rod array size. It is shown that the solid cylindrical geometry does not meet all the desired features for high power density well, and its potential for achieving high power density is limited to 20 % of current PWR power density, unless the vibration problems at the coolant higher velocity are overcome. The internally and externally cooled annular fuel potential for achieving high power density is explored, using a whole core model. The best size of fuel rods that fits in the reference <b>assembly</b> <b>dimension</b> is a 13 x 13 array, since the hot red will have a balanced MDNBR in the inner and outer channels. With proportional increase in coolant flow rate, this annular fuel can increase PWR power density by 50 % with the same DNBR margin, while reducing by 1000 'C the peak fuel temperature. Five issues involving manufacturing tolerances, oxide growth on rod surfaces, inner and outer gap conductances asymmetry, MDNBR sensitivity to changes in core operation parameter and resistance to instabilities were also evaluated. (contd.) It is found that the main uncertainty for this design is associated with the heat split between the inner and outer channels due to differences in the thermal resistances in the two fuel-clad gaps. Annular fuel is found to be resistant to flow instabilities, such as Ledinegg instability and density wave oscillation due to high system pressure and one-phase flow along most of the hot channel length. Similar power density uprate is found possible for annular fuel in a hexagonal lattice. Large break loss of coolant accident (LBLOCA) for the reference Westinghouse 4 -loop PWR utilizing annular fuel at 150 % power is analyzed using RELAP, under conservative conditions. The blowdown peak cladding temperature (PCT) is found to be lower because of the low operating fuel temperature, but the flow rate from the safety injection system needs to be increased by 50 % to remove the 50 % higher decay heat. Loss of flow analysis also showed better performance of the annular fuel because of its low stored energy. The fuel design that best meets the desired thermal and mechanical features is the spiral cross-geometry rods. The dimensions of this type of fuel that can be applied in the reference core were defined. Thermal-hydraulic whole-core evaluations were conducted with cylindrical fuel rod simplification, and critical heat flux modification based on the heat flux lateral non-uniformity in the cross geometry. This geometry was found to have the potential to increase PWR power density by 50 %. However, there are major uncertainties in the feasibility and costs of manufacturing this fuel. by Dandong Feng.
