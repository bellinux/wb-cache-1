5|$|William George Meany (August 16, 1894 – January 10, 1980) was an <b>American</b> <b>labor</b> {{union leader}} for 57 years. He {{was the key}} figure in the {{creation}} of the AFL-CIO and served as the AFL-CIO's first president, from 1955 to 1979.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Meany {{was one of}} the {{permanent}} representatives of the AFL to the National War Labor Board. During the war, he established close relationships with prominent anticommunists in the <b>American</b> <b>labor</b> movement, including David Dubinsky, Jay Lovestone and Matthew Woll. In October 1945, he led the AFL boycott of the founding conference of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which welcomed participation by labor unions from the Soviet Union and was later called a communist front.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950 campaign, both Nixon and Douglas {{were accused}} of having a voting record {{comparable}} to that of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio. The sole congressman from the <b>American</b> <b>Labor</b> Party at the time, Marcantonio represented East Harlem. He was accused of being a communist, though he denied being one; he rarely discussed the Soviet Union or communism. Marcantonio opposed restrictions on communists and the Communist Party, stating that such restrictions violated the Bill of Rights. He regularly voted against contempt citations requested by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), on which Nixon served.|$|E

5|$|He {{developed}} a reputation for honesty, diligence {{and the ability to}} testify effectively before legislative hearings and to speak clearly to the press. In 1936, he cofounded the <b>American</b> <b>Labor</b> Party, a pro-union political party active in New York, along with David Dubinsky and Sidney Hillman, partly as a vehicle to organize support for the re-election that year of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and mayor Fiorello La Guardia among socialists in the union movement.|$|E
5|$|The House of Representatives easily {{passed the}} bill in just seven days. The most {{contentious}} issue was the inclusion of Section 7(a), which protected collective bargaining rights for unions. Section 7(a) was nearly passed into the bill, but Senator Wagner, Jerome Frank, and Leon Keyserling (another Roosevelt aide) worked to retain the section {{in order to win}} the support of the <b>American</b> <b>labor</b> movement.|$|E

He eventually took this before the U.S. Supreme Court in the case Vitarelli v. Seaton. Vitarelli won the case after a two-year battle and returned to Micronesia in his previous position at the TTPI.|$|E

5|$|Anarchism as {{a social}} {{movement}} in Cuba held great influence with the working classes during the 19th and early 20th century. The movement was particularly strong following {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1886, until it was repressed first in 1925 by President Gerardo Machado, and finally by Fidel Castro's Marxist–Leninist government following the Cuban Revolution in the late 1950s. Cuban anarchism mainly took the form of anarcho-collectivism based on the works of Mikhail Bakunin and, later, anarcho-syndicalism. The Latin <b>American</b> <b>labor</b> and by extension the Cuban labor movement itself was at first more influenced by anarchism than Marxism.|$|E
5|$|Consumer {{spending}} comprises 68% of the U.S. {{economy in}} 2015. In August 2010, the <b>American</b> <b>labor</b> force consisted of 154.1 million people. With 21.2 million people, {{government is the}} leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. About 12% of workers are unionized, compared to 30% in Western Europe. The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers. The United States is ranked among the top three in the Global Competitiveness Report as well. It has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than European nations tend to.|$|E
5|$|Warned {{about the}} size of the force Bowers was raising, Gov. Davis Hanson Waite interceded again in the strike. He issued a {{proclamation}} on May 27 in which he called on the miners to disband their encampment on Bull Hill. In a development unparalleled in <b>American</b> <b>labor</b> history, he also declared the force of 1,200 deputies to be illegal and ordered the group disbanded. He also ordered the state militia to be on the alert for a possible move on Cripple Creek. On May 28, the governor visited the miners, who authorized Waite to negotiate on their behalf.|$|E

5|$|After a {{nighttime}} rifle and dynamite attack by striking miners on two mines during the Leadville Miners' Strike in 1896, which succeeded in burning down the surface works {{of one of}} the mines, even the pro-union county sheriff requested Gov. McIntire to send in the state militia, and the WFM lost the strike, and its influence in Leadville. The collapse of the 1896 Leadville strike caused the WFM to sever its relationship with the American Federation of Labor and to turn strongly to the left politically. After the Colorado Labor Wars, the WFM was instrumental in launching the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1905, but withdrew from the IWW a few years later. Although the IWW's heyday was short-lived, the union was symbolically important and the ideals embodied by it continue to deeply influence the <b>American</b> <b>labor</b> movement to this day.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the major}} record {{companies}} dominate the American music industry, an independent music industry (indie music) does exist. Most indie record labels have limited, if any, retail distribution outside a small region. Artists sometimes record for an indie label and gain enough acclaim {{to be signed}} to a major label; others choose to remain at an indie label for their entire careers. Indie music may be in styles generally similar to mainstream music, but is often inaccessible, unusual, or otherwise unappealing to many people. Indie musicians often release {{some or all of}} their songs over the Internet for fans and others to download and listen. In addition to recording artists of many kinds, there are numerous fields of professional musicianship in the United States, many of whom rarely record, including community orchestras, wedding singers and bands, lounge singers, and nightclub DJs. The American Federation of Musicians is the largest <b>American</b> <b>labor</b> union for professional musicians. However, only 15% of the Federation's members have steady music employment.|$|E
