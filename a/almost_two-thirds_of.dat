5|$|Manhattan is the {{economic}} engine of New York City, with its 2.3million workers in 2007 {{drawn from the}} entire New York metropolitan area accounting for <b>almost</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> all jobs in New York City. In {{the first quarter of}} 2014, the average weekly wage in Manhattan (New York County) was $2,749, representing the highest total among large counties in the United States. Manhattan's workforce is overwhelmingly focused on white collar professions, with manufacturing nearly extinct. Manhattan also has the highest per capita income of any county in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Another {{complication}} is {{release in}} multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged. One notable {{example of this}} phenomenon is Avatar, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: <b>almost</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films. Social and economic factors such as population change {{and the growth of}} international markets also impact on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's tickets, or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more.|$|E

As there was as yet no secret ballot in South Carolina, Tillman threatened to remember any votes cast for the Republicans. That precinct gave 211 votes for the Democrats and 2 for the Republicans. Although <b>almost</b> <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> those eligible to vote in Edgefield were African Americans, the Democrats were able to suppress the (Republican) African-American vote, reporting a win for Hampton in Edgefield County with over 60 percent of the vote.

5|$|Groucho Marx played Waldorf T. Beagle (later renamed Waldorf T. Flywheel), and Chico played Emmanuel Ravelli, {{the same}} name as the Italian {{character}} {{he played in the}} film Animal Crackers (1930). Mary McCoy played secretary Miss Dimple, and it is thought that Broderick Crawford also appeared as various characters. Groucho and Chico shared a weekly income of $6,500 for appearing in the show. During the Great Depression, this was considered a high sum for 30 minutes' work, especially since radio scripts required no memorization and only a few minutes were needed for costume, hair and makeup. By comparison, Greta Garbo's weekly salary from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer during the same period was also $6,500, though this was for a 40- or 50-hour week. Wynn was paid $5,000 a week for Fire Chief.

40|$|Abstract: Transportation {{models have}} not been {{adequate}} in addressing severe long-term urban transportation problems that transportation disadvantaged groups overwhelmingly encounter, and the negative impacts of transportation on the disadvantaged {{have not been}} effectively considered in the modeling studies. Therefore this paper aims to develop a transportation modeling approach {{in order to understand}} the travel patterns of the transportation disadvantaged, and help in developing policies to solve the problems of the disadvantaged. Effectiveness of this approach is tested in a pilot study in Aydin, Turkey. After determining disadvantaged groups by a series of spatial and statistical analyses, the approach is integrated with a travel demand model. The model is run for both disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged populations to examine the differences between their travel behaviors. The findings of the pilot study reveal that <b>almost</b> <b>two-third</b> <b>of</b> the population is disadvantaged, and this modeling approach could particularly be useful in disadvantage-sensitive planning studies to deploy relevant landuse and transportation policies for disadvantaged groups...|$|R

40|$|Findings of {{a singing}} {{experiment}} {{are presented in}} which trained and untrained singers sang melodies of familiar and less familiar Beatles songs from memory and after listening to the original song on CD. Results showed that adopting the correct pitch of a melody was done better by trained singers, and only after listening to the song. Contours of melodies were equally well reproduced by both trained and untrained singers. In contrast, the intervals of a melody were sung more accurately by trained singers than by untrained singers. These findings demonstrate the dominance of contour for remembering melodies and the poorer interval encoding of melodies {{or the lack of}} essential singing skills by untrained singers. When singing from memory, <b>almost</b> <b>two-third</b> <b>of</b> the singing came reasonably close to the actual tempo on the CD. This improved to more than 70 % after listening to the song on CD. In general, the singing of less familiar melodies improved after song listening. Implications for ‘query by humming’ applications are discussed. ...|$|R
30|$|Bioprospecting {{of biomass}} towards {{establishment}} of bio-refineries for augmentation of commodity chemicals and fuel generation warrants mandatory attention. Lignocellulosic (LC) biomass, locally available in plenty, requires less capital investments for bioconversion, reduces {{greenhouse gas emission}} and creates employment opportunities in rural livelihood. <b>Almost</b> <b>two-third</b> <b>of</b> the lignocellulosics are comprised of cellulose (40 – 50 %), hemicelluloses (25 – 35 %) and lignin (15 – 20 %). Hydrolytic enzymes are very crucial to break the complex biomass into macromolecules and then into simple sugars, towards the production of biomass-derived sugars, bioproducts and biochemicals. The total cellulase system consists of three enzymatic activities: (i) Endo-β- 1, 4 -d-glucanase (EC 3.2. 1.4) which randomly cleaves accessible intermolecular β- 1, 4 glycosidic bonds {{on the surface of}} cellulose. (ii) Exoglucanase (CBH, EC 3.2. 1.91) that cleaves cellobiose units from both reducing and non-reducing end of cellulose chains. (iii) Finally, β-glucosidases (BG, EC 3.2. 1.91) that hydrolyze the remaining glycosidic bonds to form glucose, which can then simultaneously or in a separate step get converted to the desired product by a fermenting biocatalyst.|$|R
40|$|Plasmalogens (Pls) {{represent}} a specific subclass of glycerophospholipids {{characterized by the}} presence of a vinyl-ether bond at the sn- 1 position of glycerol. Pls are quantitatively important in membranes of neuronal tissues, including the brain and the retina, where they can represent until <b>almost</b> <b>two-third</b> <b>of</b> ethanolamine glycerophospholipids. They are considered as reservoirs of polyunsaturated fatty acids as several studies have shown that arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids are preferentially esterified on Pls when compared to other glycerophospholipids. Reduced levels of Pls were observed in a number of neurodegenerative disorders such as glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. In a mouse model of Pls deficiency, "glaucoma-like" optic nerve abnormalities were observed as well as developmental defects in the eye. These included microphthalmia, dysgenesis of the anterior segment of the eye, and abnormalities in retinal vessel architecture. Several data from animal and in vitro studies suggest that Pls may be involved in the regulation of retinal vascular development through the release of polyunsaturated fatty acids by a calcium-independent phospholipase A 2.

30|$|In this study, we {{describe}} the production of secrete heterologous protein SubC in L. lactis using the NICE expression system. SubC is the industrially important Carlsberg-type subtilisin (Jacobs 1995) produced by Bacillus licheniformis. Bacterial subtilisins are multipurpose alkaline proteases that are frequently used in industry (Gupta et al. 2002): common variants include subtilisin from B. amyloliquefaciens, highly alkalophilic B. lentus or from B. licheniformis (Rao et al. 1998; von der Osten et al. 1993). Furthermore, Flavobacterium also produces subtilisin (Morita et al. 1998). Interestingly, <b>almost</b> <b>two-third</b> <b>of</b> commercial proteases produced in the world originate from microorganisms (Kumar & Takagi 1999; Tremacoldi et al. 2004). Microbial proteases are classified into different groups, according to their activity in acid, neutral or alkaline conditions, and {{on the characteristics of}} the active site group of the enzyme (Saeki et al. 2007). Subtilisin-like serine proteases are usually secreted extracellulary for searching nutrients (Aehle et al. 2009). One of the features of this class of proteases (subtilases) is an aromatic or hydrophobic residue, such as leucine, tyrosine or phenylalanine. The highest proteolytic activity is around pH 10, with a molecular weight range of 15 – 40 kDa and an isoelectric point around pI 9. Moreover, the native form of SubC remains fully stable up to 60 °C (Hirata et al. 2003) and it possesses two calcium binding site(s), therefore bound Ca 2 + contributes to enzyme stability (Briedigkeit & Frömmel 1989).|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent {{years have}} seen an {{unprecedented}} increase in funds for procurement of health commodities in developing countries.

Method: A health facility survey was conducted {{to collect data on}} staff employed, their main tasks, availability {{on the day of the}} survey, reasons for absenteeism, and experience of supervisory visits from District Health Teams. Indepth interview with health workers was done to explore their perception of work load. A time and motion study of nurses in the Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) clinics documented their time use by task.
