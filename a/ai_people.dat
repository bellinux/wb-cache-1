40|$|Abstract: Understanding {{the extent}} of {{commitment}} to and identifi cation with traditional cultural experiences is essential for working with American Indian (<b>AI)</b> <b>people</b> (Whitbeck, 2006). The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the usefulness of a practical measure of enculturation for <b>AI</b> <b>people</b> by examining its reliability and validity within the context of three previous studies. Enculturation is an important construct in understanding the traditional cultural experiences of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/ AN) people. Whereas acculturation has been defi ned as “the degree to which the individual … accepts and adheres to both majority (White/ Euro-American) and tribal cultural values ” (Choney, Berryhill-Paapke, & Robbins, 1995, p. 76), enculturation is the process by which an individual learns about and identifi es with his or her own cultural roots (Littl...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although chronic {{liver disease}} remains a major area of health {{disparity}} for American Indian (<b>AI)</b> <b>people,</b> the epidemiology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among <b>AI</b> <b>people</b> is poorly documented. Because of suspected high local prevalence, two remote AI clinics in the Northern Plains implemented universal prenatal HCV screening in 2005. When this screening program reported an unexpectedly high prenatal anti-HCV (anti-HCV antibody) positivity rate, {{we conducted a}} case-control study to determine risks for infection and opportunities for community intervention. MAIN FINDINGS: The clinics screened a total of 205 pregnant women (median age, 22 years). Of these 205 women, a total of 13 (6. 3 %; 95 % confidence interval, 3. 4 – 10. 6) had anti-HCV confirmed. Of the anti-HCV-positive women, 10 (76. 9 %) were aged 15 – 24 years. We included 10 cases and 40 anti-HCV-negative prenatal controls in a case-control study. On multivariate analysis, only injection-drug use (IDU) remained associated with HCV seropositivity. CONCLUSIONS: Universal prenatal screening revealed a high prevalence of anti-HCV at these remote AI clinics. This population has not been previously described at being at elevated risk for HCV infection. In order to reduce health disparities, young, rural AI populations seeking prenatal care need {{to be included in}} interventions to reduce HCV transmission...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2015. Major: Social and Administrative Pharmacy. Advisor: Melissa Walls. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 120 pages. American Indian (<b>AI)</b> <b>people</b> experience {{higher rates of}} depressive symptoms, psychological distress, and poor mental health than non-Native Americans. Despite a 17. 1 % prevalence of Anishinabe (an indigenous {{people who live in}} the Midwest of the United States and Canada) adults living with type 2 diabetes and meeting the PHQ- 9 cutoff for depression, half (51. 3 %) of those surveyed were flourishing according to Keyes' Mental Health Continuum [...] Short Form (MHC-SF). A unique paradox appears to exist for <b>AI</b> <b>people</b> more so than that documented for other groups: despite historical trauma, various social stressors, ongoing marginalization, and depression and chronic diseases, a disproportionately large number of <b>AI</b> <b>people</b> met criteria for flourishing mental health. In order to better understand Anishinabe concepts of mental wellness and the utility of the MHC in this population, the specific aim of the study was to gain a deeper understanding of indigenous interpretations of positive mental health (PMH) by engaging in a group concept mapping session with Anishinabe community members from two communities. The resulting concept map varied somewhat from the three aspects of PMH presented in Keyes' MHC-SF (emotional, psychological, and social wellbeing). According to the map, PMH included the following clusters: 1) Values Gained with Maturity, 2) Motivated, 3) Traditional Spirituality/Culture, 4) Culturally Competent/Accept Others, 5) Take Care of Self, 6) Financial Health/Organized, 7) Ethical/Moral Leadership, 8) Community, and 9) Family/Relationships. Many of the clusters were related at least in part to the MHC-SF, but some differences were evident. Additionally, themes of harmony and balance, resilience and coping, and connection and interconnectedness, while not found in the MHC-SF, were prominent aspects in this concept map, lending support to their importance in indigenous PMH. Overall, the theme of interconnection is key to understanding the results of the concept map. The focus of this study fulfilled calls for strengths-based (as opposed to deficit-based) research for indigenous people. This was significant not only for better understanding Anishinabe perspectives of PMH, but also for understanding the ways in which all groups of people can learn lessons about PMH through cross-cultural research...|$|E
40|$|Since 1960 s, logicians, philosophers, <b>AI</b> <b>people</b> {{have cast}} eyes on modal logic.

40|$|The culture concept {{maintains}} an extended history of being {{taken up by}} diverse groups and ascribed different meanings to serve distinct agendas. This is certainly true of the ideas of culture circulating at the intersections of American Indian (AI) and behavioral health (BH) settings where popular culture concepts have been problematized by modern culture theorists yet continue to inform clinical practice. An afterthought in most BH settings, culture {{and its role in}} supporting the wellness of <b>AI</b> <b>peoples</b> is of primary concern for Indian Health Service sponsored BH clinics. As a result, I partnered with one such clinic in a Midwestern urban AI health organization to better understand the relations between culture concepts and clinical practice by conducting a clinic ethnography. Findings highlight a major disjunction between how service providers (SPs) talked about culture and clinical practice in abstract (cultural re-connection) and how they described and demonstrated clinical practice in concrete (cultural re-imagination). This disjunction reflects a major predicament facing the fields of BH wherein engagement with traditional cultures stands at odds with modern American cultural assumptions embedded in clinical training. Encouraged to engage with traditional AI cultural forms, SPs in this clinic—like their counterparts across fields of BH—did not abandon their modern clinical training. Instead, by adding symbols of cultural difference to otherwise standard, high quality clinical practice, they repackaged clinically familiar ideas, tools, and techniques as culturally different. Rather than immersion into a life-world familiar to AI ancestors ala cultural re-connection, then, SPs engaged clients in cultural re-imagination by using representations of AI culture in therapy to assist in fashioning positive modern Native identities to buttress against messages of devaluation encountered in modern America. While likely a therapeutic re-imagining of AI culture for distressed clients, concerns were raised around essentialism in representations of Indigeneity and socio-political processes of re-imagining <b>AI</b> <b>peoples</b> as populations demarcated by a circumscribed expressions of identity difference legible within contemporary BH. Finally, this work underscores the essential role of cultural analyses via ethnography for any rigorous science of clinical practice...|$|R

Roger Schank's research in AI takes seriously the ideas that understanding natural language involves mapping its expressions into an internal representation scheme and that these internal representations have a syntax appropriate for computational operations. It therefore falls within the computational approach to the study of mind. This paper discusses certain aspects of Schank's approach in order to assess its potential adequacy as a (partial) model of cognition. This version of the Language of Thought hypothesis encounters some of the same difficulties that arise for Fodor's account. Two influential and much-discussed themes in the philosophy of mind/ cognitive science literature are (1) that understanding natural anguage involves mapping its expressions onto some kind of internal representa-tion scheme, and (2) that the resulting representations exhibit a syntax such that they are susceptible to computational operations. These ideas have been taken seriously in Roger Schank's artificial intelligence projects at Yale University, where a variety of computer programs have been based upon them. Schank's ultimate research goal is not only to build AI systems that exhibit human-like linguistic behavior, but also to provide a psychologically accurate computer model of various human mental processes involved in the understanding of language. His work, therefore, falls squarely within the 'computational' approach to the study of mind...|$|E

40|$|One {{thing that}} {{concerns}} me about the current excitement and interest in appreciative inquiry (AI) {{is that many of}} the consultants and managers I talk to who claim to be doing AI don’t seem to understand the importance of generativity, as an input and an outcome, of <b>AI.</b> Many <b>people</b> seem to get blinded by the “positive stuff”. After years of focusing on problems and deficits and dysfunction they get entranced with “focusing on the positive ” and equate this with AI, but I don’t think that is the core of appreciative inquiry. Instead, the core of AI is generativity (Cooperrider & Srivastva, 1987). One of the central sources that influenced the creation of AI was Kenneth Gergen’s (1978) paper “Toward Generative Theory ” where he argued that the most important thing social science can do is give us new ways to think about social structures and institutions that lead to new options for action. AI can be generative in a number of ways. It is the quest for new ideas, images, theories and models that liberate our collective aspirations, alter the social construction of reality and, in the process, make available decisions and actions that weren’t available or didn’t occur to us before. When successful, AI generates spontaneous, unsupervised, individual, group and organizational action toward a better future. My research suggests that when AI is transformational it has both these qualities: it leads to new ideas, and it leads people to choose new actions (Bushe, in press; Bushe & Kassam, 2005).

Both companies developed second-generation products based on the CADR: the Symbolics 3600 and the LMI-LAMBDA (of which LMI managed to sell around 200). The 3600, which shipped a year late, expanded on the CADR by widening the machine word to 36-bits, expanding the address space to 28-bits, and adding hardware to accelerate certain common functions that were implemented in microcode on the CADR. The LMI-LAMBDA, which came out {{a year after the}} 3600, in 1983, was mostly upward compatible with the CADR (source CADR microcode fragments could be reassembled), but there were improvements in instruction fetch and other hardware differences including use of a multiplier chip and a faster logic family and cache memory. The LAMBDA's processor cards were designed to work in a NuBus based engineering workstation, which had been originated by Steve Ward's group at MIT, and, through a separate chain of events, was being developed by Western Digital Corporation. This allowed the popular LAMBDA [...] "2x2" [...] configuration whereby two machines shared one infrastructure, with considerable savings.

[URL] Powerpoint, presented {{as part of a}} webinar held at the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center (NIWRC), examines findings from a study of the prevalence of violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women. Few estimates are available to describe the prevalence of violence experienced by American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) women and men. In addition, these estimates are often based on local rather than national samples. The few available national estimates are often based on very small samples. These small samples do not always accurately represent the AI and AN population in the United States. This study provides the first set of estimates from a national large-scale survey of victimization among self-identified AI and AN men and women on psychological aggression, coercive control and entrapment, physical violence, stalking, and sexual violence, using detailed behaviorally specific questions. These results are expected to raise awareness and understanding of violence experienced by <b>AI</b> and AN <b>people.</b> The webinar also will highlight the need for additional services that are needed for AI and AN victims of crime—a need that has been persistently noted but lacked the research to support efforts to increase resources or allocate them appropriately...|$|R
40|$|Artificial Intelligence (AI) {{has shown}} {{competence}} in helping people with complex cognitive decisions like {{air traffic control}} and playing chess. The goal of this work is to demonstrate that <b>AI</b> can help <b>people</b> with social decisions. In this work Artificial Intelligence of Social Networks is used to improve human-human communication, recognizing the social characteristics of human relations {{in order to achieve}} a more natural online communication interface. Can a computer learn to understand the value of communication? It is shown here that a first attempt at social context classification performs with almost 70 % reliability. Could a computer use this to help a person relate to other people through technology? The addition of social context to an email interface is shown to have a positive effect in a user’s online communication behavior. Email is a tool that people use practically every day, making an implicit statement about their relationships with other people, and providing an opportunity for a computer to learn about their social network. Furthermore, over the years people have come to utilize and depend on email more in their daily lives, but the tool has hardly changed to help people deal with the overwhelming amount of information.

40|$|This paper explores, from a {{theoretical}} and technical point of view, {{the role of}} head rotation and eye gaze directionality to the human perception of attention from nonverbal cues. We have annotated two {{different versions of the}} same dataset, in order to correlate the above parameters with the degree people have considered people in the dataset pay attention to a hypothetical task they have in front of them. Based on our findings, we investigate the role of eye gaze directionality in relation to head rotations and, based on previous studies, we developed an algorithm for estimating attention levels from head pose, eye gaze and facial feature spatial locations. With the help of our <b>AI</b> system and <b>people's</b> annotation, we have made a first attempt towards quantifying the role of each cue to the overall estimation of attention. One of the important properties of the technical part of this work is that all systems we used were non-intrusive and did not demand any personal training or calibration phase, constituting themselves ideal for Game playing. Knowing the behavioral state of a player can be of vital importance for adapting the game design during interaction, or building personal profiles, leading to appropriate game features aiming at maximizing player satisfaction. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
