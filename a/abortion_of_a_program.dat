5000|$|In another respect Catholic {{canon law}} {{continued}} even after 1869 to maintain <b>a</b> distinction between <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> formed and <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unformed fetus. As indicated above in a quotation from Thomas Aquinas, one who procured the <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quickened fetus was considered [...] "irregular", meaning {{that he was}} disqualified from receiving or exercising Holy Orders. Pope Sixtus V extended this penalty even to early-term <b>abortion</b> (section 2 <b>of</b> his bull Effraenatam), but Gregory XIV restricted it again. Pius IX made no ruling in its regard, {{with the result that}} the penalty of irregularity was still limited to late-term abortion {{at the time of the}} article [...] "Abortion" [...] in the 1907 Catholic Encyclopedia.

5000|$|Even when Church law, in {{line with}} the theory of delayed ensoulment, {{assigned}} different penalties to earlier and later abortions, abortion at any stage was considered a grave evil.

He wrote: [...] "This sin, although grave and to be reckoned among misdeeds and against nature...is something less than homicide... nor is such to be judged irregular unless one procures the <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> already formed fetus." ...|$|R

50|$|From a {{view that}} favors the act of {{bringing}} people into existence, {{it has been argued}} that avoidance from conceiving a child when there are prerequisites for raising it is comparable to causing the death of one. Also, {{it has been argued that}} contraception, and even the decision not to procreate at all could be regarded as immoral on a similar basis as abortion. However, holding value in potential persons does not necessarily decrease support for abortion rights. It has been regarded as justified to induce <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> severely disabled fetus in favor for conceiving a new child. However, a major reason that has been given to be cautious about performing abortion with such motivation is the fact that the likelihood of successfully bringing the new child into existence is substantially lower, as the parents may separate, one of them may become sterile, or they may change their minds about having children. A comparable situation is the <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unintended pregnancy in favor for conceiving a new child later in better conditions.|$|R

5000|$|Although the Decretum Gratiani, which {{remained}} {{the basis of}} Catholic canon law until replaced by the 1917 Code of Canon Law, distinguished between early-term and late-term abortions, that canonical distinction was abolished for <b>a</b> period <b>of</b> three years by the bull of Pope Sixtus V, Effraenatam, of 28 October 1588. This decreed various penalties against perpetrators of all forms <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> without distinction. Calling abortion murder, it decreed that those who procured the <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fetus, [...] "whether animated or unanimated, formed or unformed" [...] should suffer the same punishments as [...] "true murderers and assassins who have actually and really committed murder." [...] As well as decreeing those punishments for subjects of the Papal States, whose civil ruler he was, Pope Sixtus also inflicted on perpetrators the spiritual punishment of automatic excommunication (section 7). Sixtus's successor, Pope Gregory XIV, recognizing that the law was not producing the hoped-for effects, withdrew it three years later, limiting the punishments to <b>abortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "formed" [...] fetus. With his 1869 bull Apostolicae Sedis moderationi, Pope Pius IX rescinded Gregory XIV's not-yet-animated fetus exception {{with regard to the}} spiritual penalty of excommunication, declaring that those who procured an effective abortion incurred excommunication reserved to bishops or ordinaries.
