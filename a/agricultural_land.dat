40|$|This study {{examines}} individuals 2 ̆ 7 preferences for protected <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands.</b> While {{there is a}} preponderance of studies quantifying the magnitudes and determinants of support for farmland protection studies rarely examine preferences for post-protection aspects of <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands.</b> However, farmlands are living systems subjected to land use strategies employed by their managers. So even in instances when farmland has been protected {{in accordance with the}} public 2 ̆ 7 s stated preferences, the actual farmland management strategy employed might not deliver what the public expects. This dissertation seeks to contribute to this gap in knowledge in two ways. First, I focus on the back-end of farmland protection, i. e. the types of preferences individuals have for <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> once they are protected. Second, I explore how individual preferences for protected <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> are products of social interactions. Using Boulder County, Colorado as a case study, I address these questions using semi-structured, in-depth interviews with stakeholders, a general population survey, and a hedonic pricing model. Findings from qualitative interviews revealed that stakeholders have general concerns about the management aspects for protected <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> and specific concerns about the management plans for protected <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands,</b> about land tenure relationships shaping the management process, and about what property rights the general public acquires when they support efforts to protect <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands.</b> Findings from the general population survey indicate that respondents are most interested in the non-market amenity benefits often associated with <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands.</b> Moreover, many of the preferences expressed in the survey suggest that many of the benefits may not require <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands,</b> but may be derived from open space lands. For instance, when respondents support efforts to protect <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> they are more concerned with limiting development (70...|$|R

However, far too little {{attention has been paid to}} proper evaluations on the existing spontaneous <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands,</b> despite the fact that some <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> remain neglected or public lands are being illegally used by individuals. Our research area, Gwanak-gu, is a representative case with many spontaneous <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> that carry various risk factors such as that of disaster, environmental pollution, and degradation of the landscape in the city. The purpose of this study is to categorize the types and problems of <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> in Gwanak-gu through a field survey. By using Geographic Information System and satellite images, field surveys and interviews, we showed the current distribution status. As a result, 45 areas of <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands,</b> mainly located around the edges of Mt. Gwanak, were found. The <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> were classified into six categories: three of those, flat Vegetable Garden, Edge Vegetable Garden and Private Weekend Farm, are well managed, while three types, Farm in Forest Edge, Farm in Forest, Shabby Farm, are in poor condition. The study discusses what caused lands to be either well managed or ruined. This study has an objective to discover whether spontaneous <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> have the possibility to become community open spaces...|$|R

This research examined the potential contributions that short-rotation forest crops grown on marginal <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> can make in producing biomass for wood-based power plants and in supplying wood to the forest industry. A large-scale regional scheduling model was used to allocate forest and <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> {{in order to minimize}} wood production costs for forest industry as well as power plant uses. Alternative potential sites for a wood-based power plant were examined in terms of wood production costs and of transportation implications. Preliminary recommendations as to the most appropriate <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> and sites for power plants are made. The higher productivity of <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> leads to reduced harvesting of forest lands. The associated indirect environmental benefits and the direct environmental benefits from putting <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> under tree cover are the subject of additional research.
