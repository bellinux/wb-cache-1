A particular advantage is that the technique can generate a continuous measurement for analyzing process streams.Laser diffraction measures particle size distributions by measuring the angular variation in intensity of light scattered as a laser beam passes through a dispersed particulate sample. Large particles scatter light at small angles relative to the laser beam and small particles scatter light at large angles, as illustrated below.

We have shown that the Mdci form of heptacosane is monoclinic (Aa, Z = 4). Moreover, at each phase transition Oi → Odci → Mdci, a substantial decrease in intensity of the 0 0 l reflections and an increase in the interlayer spacing due to end-gauche defects are observed.

40|$|Laser {{diffraction}} is {{a robust}} and precise technique for measuring wire diameters. However, classical Fraunhofer diffraction formulas are inappropriate {{for determining the}} size of three-dimensional objects. Babinet's principle (from classical diffraction theory) allows {{the use of such}} formulas only for <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>diffraction</b> tending to zero. In practice diffraction measurements require a finite angular range (about 10 °) for good resolution. We show that use of the classical slit-diffraction formula for this extended angular interval introduces significant error. We develop a simple diffraction model valid for cylindrical shapes and a formula to obtain the diameter of cylindrical wires. To validate the diffraction formula we calibrate the diameter of the wires using an independent interferometric technique, which to our knowledge is original for this particular task. We have verified our diffraction formula to within about 0. 2 µm for various wire materials and diameters (30 µm to 300 µm) and a wide angular range (± 25 °). Two different experimental set-ups were implemented to increase the reliability of the results. The calibration procedure revealed a systematic disagreement with Babinet's principle, in particular a systematic overestimation of the diameter by about 0. 6 µm, almost independent of the material and the diameter itself. This is particularly relevant to metrological applications involving diffraction phenomena and based on classical diffraction theory...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} data {{consisting of}} photon counts of diffracted x-ray radiation {{as a function}} of the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>diffraction.</b> The problem is to determine the positions, powers and shapes of the relevant peaks. An additional difficulty is that the power of the peaks is to be measured from a baseline which itself must be identified. Most methods of de-noising data of this kind do not explicitly take into account the modality of the final estimate. The residual-based procedure we propose uses the so-called taut string method, which minimizes the number of peaks subject to a tube constraint on the integrated data. The baseline is identified by combining the result of the taut string with an estimate of the first derivative of the baseline obtained using a weighted smoothing spline. Finally, each individual peak is expressed as the finite sum of kernels chosen from a parametric family.

This solution relaxes the constraints on the device packaging and is suitable for wafer-level assembly. Several cells have been fabricated and characterized in a clock setup using coherent population trapping spectroscopy. The measured signals exhibit null power linewidths down to 2. 23 kHz and high transmission contrasts up to 17 %.

However this test takes more than 8 hours and the analyzer needs to spend one hour on this work. To shorten this time, we examined another method to quantify oolitics by using X-ray diffractometric analysis for quartz. We chose the calibration curve method as a quantitative. First, we changed the quartz content by using quartz and feldspar, then measured the diffraction X-ray intensity, and obtained calibration curve between quartz content and diffraction X-ray intensity. As a result of comparing each diffraction X-ray intensity of the first peak (<b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>diffraction</b> is 2 θ 26. 6 °) and the second peak (2 θ 20. 9 °) with quartz quantity analyzed from the silica program, the quantitative precision from the second peak was found to be better, because there was no other material peaked around 2 θ 20. 9 ° for green sand.

30|$|Under the {{hydrothermal}} conditions, HMTA will hydrolyze {{and release}} NH 3 to provide (OH)−. Finally, {{the reaction of}} Zn 2 + and (OH)− brings the products, ZnO and H 2 O. It is obvious that HMTA {{plays a key role}} to form Zn-O bonds. The (002) plane of wurtzite-structured ZnO is terminated with Zn 2 +, resulting in polar top surfaces with positive charge. In the chemical solution, non-polar HMTA will precedently chelate the non-polar facets except the polar (002) plane for epitaxial method. Therefore, a preferential growth along (002) is reasonably observed. Meanwhile, substitution of Y for Zn during the growth of nanorods can be obtained, which is similar to the synthesized process of Ce-doped ZnO nanorods [32]. Compared with ZnO nanorods, the XRD spectrum of ZnO:Y nanorods exhibits obvious single <b>diffraction</b> peak <b>of</b> (002) and two slight peaks of (101) and (100) as shown in the inset of Figure 1. The obvious decrease <b>of</b> (002) <b>diffraction</b> peak intensity for ZnO:Y nanorods shows the restrain of the crystallization compared with ZnO samples. The result also indicates the suppression of growth rate along (002) crystal plane and slight enhancement of growth rate along (101) and (100) crystal planes. Besides, the decrease of a-axle lattice constants from 3.2526 to 3.2576 Å and c-axle lattice constant from 5.1849 to 5.1904 Å is obtained from the 2 θ <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>diffraction</b> peaks measured from ZnO and ZnO:Y nanorods. The reason is that the radius of Y 3 + ion (0.92 Å) is larger than that of Zn 2 + ion (0.74 Å), and the doping of Y into ZnO nanorods should lead the increase of a- and c-axis lattice constants and, correspondingly, the shift <b>of</b> all <b>diffraction</b> peaks towards lower 2 θ angle.|$|R

40|$|An acousto-optic {{cryogenic}} {{flow sensor}} (CFS) determines mass flow of cryogens for spacecraft propellant management. The CFS operates unobtrusively in a high-pressure, high-flowrate cryogenic environment to provide measurements for fluid quality {{as well as}} mass flow rate. Experimental hardware uses an optical plane-of-light (POL) to detect the onset of two-phase flow, {{and the presence of}} particles in the flow of water. Acousto-optic devices are used in laser equipment for electronic control of the intensity and position of the laser beam. Acousto-optic interaction occurs in all optical media when an acoustic wave and a laser beam are present. When an acoustic wave is launched into the optical medium, it generates a refractive index wave that behaves like a sinusoidal grating. An incident laser beam passing through this grating will diffract the laser beam into several orders. Its angular position is linearly proportional to the acoustic frequency, so that the higher the frequency, the larger the diffracted angle. If the acoustic wave is traveling in a moving fluid, the fluid velocity will affect the frequency of the traveling wave, relative to a stationary sensor. This frequency shift changes the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>diffraction,</b> hence, fluid velocity can be determined from the diffraction angle. The CFS acoustic Bragg grating data test indicates that it is capable of accurately determining flow from 0 to 10 meters per second. The same sensor can be used in flow velocities exceeding 100 m/s.

40|$|We have {{considered}} the basic aspects of the technology of animated and stereographic rainbow images. These images can be included in Optical Security Devices (OSDs) {{in order to increase}} their structure complexity and to improve their protective properties. The cited technology provides, on the one hand, a simple identification on the visual level of verification and, on the other hand, the sufficient reliability against counterfeits. The last property is achieved at first by the division of the elemental unit on elemental regions of any adjusted shape with outline of the precision that is inaccessible for the recreation without Electron Beam Lithography Equipment (EBLE) which is used for the recording of OSDs. Second, the used encoding methods also assure the certain reliability. In the context of the paper, the theoretical discussion based a quantitative formulation of the Huygens [...] Fresnel law of the diffraction on an elemental diffractive grating is carried out. For other definite Conditions of Lighting and Observation of Diffracting Light (CLODL), the correlation between the slope <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>diffraction</b> grating strokes and the corresponding horizontal parallax angle is got; and the parameter which defines the channel selection (the quality of splitting into separate channels) is introduced. The rule for the definition of the wavelength and the intensity of light that diffracts on a given grating under certain CLODL is derived as well. This fact allows one to create the software utility that models the behavior of anigrams or stereograms. An algorithm of the synthesis of anigrams and stereograms as parts of OSDs using the technology of a composite “figure” elemental unit (that is composed from parts of any shape) and applying the halftone encoding by the period, filling, and achromaticity or all these parameters at once is elaborated, and its software implementation is constructed.

40|$|The {{electronics}} {{which makes}} our lives easier like mobiles, computers, digital cameras contain chips with very small semiconductor components like transistors. When transistors {{can be made}} even smaller, the chip can accommodate {{a larger number of}} components, which gives more processing capacity, resulting in a faster device with an increased functionality. Industrial lithography, the art of making structures on wafers, follows Moore’s law (1970 ’s), which states that “the processor speed, or overall processing power for computers would double almost every two years”, i. e., the number of transistors in an integrated circuit would double almost every two years. The implications of this law is clearly seen in the evolution of electronic devices where smaller, lighter and faster computers, high resolution imaging sensors, increased storage capacity are continuously being introduced in the market. But this also sets stringent requirements on lithography processes. The critical dimension printed on a wafer these days are in order of a few tens of nano-meters which in perspective is approximately 1000 times smaller than a strand of human hair. The technology nodes and the uniformity of the line-width or critical dimension (CD) over the wafer as produced by lithographic scanners must be improved in future for an optimal yield and performance of the electronic components. Now, the question is how to design a measurement method that is able to quantify the printing quality of these small features in a fast, stable and non destructive way which can also be incorporated into the machine which makes these chips? When you can measure something and express it in numbers, you know something about it. Lord Kelvin's statement is frequently paraphrased as ``if you can measure something, you can make it better". The research work presented in the thesis is a step forward in that direction, regarding wafer inspection. In the semiconductor industry, a robust, reliable and repeatable in-line control process is required to obtain the intended line shapes and sizes. This is achieved by printing special targets on the wafer, typically gratings, which are successively measured in order to adjust dose, exposure time, overlay/alignment and other relevant process parameters of the photo-lithographic machine. As the specifications get tighter, the measuring technique has to be more accurate. This is the primary reason for the continuous development of increasingly complex, advanced and improved quantitative metrology techniques over the years. Currently, in the semiconductor industry, incoherent optical scatterometry (IOS) is the standard workhorse. Any degree of improvement in the present technique is worthwhile of scientific and technological interest. In this thesis we develop, study, design and implement coherent Fourier scatterometry (CFS). The scatterometer is based on a coherent source of illumination, where a focused spot interacts with the sample. The performance of CFS is compared with IOS in terms of sensitivity to the change in grating shape parameters. The studies are done on grating as samples for the performance comparison. The grating reconstruction is proved with the experimental implementation of a CF scatterometer. Applications and improvements in CFS are also discussed in the thesis. The thesis starts with an introduction to the research goals and scope of CFS in chapter 1. The grating diffraction formula, which predicts the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>diffraction</b> for a given incidence angle on the grating is explained and the relevance of rigorous coupled wave analysis popularly known as RCWA as a rigorous Maxwell’s solver for periodic structure are highlighted. A brief introduction to principle of the Shack-Hartmann sensor used in experiments is also mentioned. This chapter also contains a summarized description of the work done within the PhD period but are not in the scope of the description in the thesis. In chapter 2 of the thesis, a framework to study the increment in sensitivity of CFS with respect to the IOS and the benefits of using a focused spot from a spatially coherent source (laser) is investigated on a theoretical viewpoint. A specific model of the grating and the illumination is presented, where the grating is defined in terms of a finite number of geometrical shape parameters (such as height, side-wall angles, midCD). The focused spot is scanned over the grating, and for each scan position, a far-field diffraction pattern is recorded. Through sensitivity analysis, we show that the use of coherence and multiple scanning makes CFS more sensitive than IOS under special circumstances. The role of the incident and output polarization, the position of the focused spot w. r. t. the grating and the effect of the number of scanning positions on the sensitivity analysis is also studied. There is an optimum number of scanning positions, which depends on the number of diffracted orders in the exit pupil. Owing to the coherent illumination, the far field in CFS comprise phase information concealed in the complex reflection matrix of interaction. Intensity data with phase between scattered orders is the maximum information that can be extracted in CFS. Unravelling the complex reflection matrix in CFS requires the knowledge of the amplitude and phase of the individual components of the matrix. Intensity measurements provide the amplitude information but the phase information is absent. In chapter 3 of the thesis, we present a non interferometric partial phase retrieval method from the intensity measurements in CFS. The applicability of the principle of temporal phase shifting interferometry (TPSI) in CFS with a scanning spot is presented. An analytical relation is derived and illustrated for the phase difference between two overlapping orders in the exit pupil. The analytic results are compared with the simulations from RCWA. Also, the polarization dependent phase sensitivity of grating parameters is studied for the overlap region of diffracted orders in the exit pupil. In chapter 4, the implementation of an operational CFS instrument in the laboratory environment is reported for grating reconstruction. The setup is capable of illuminating and measuring the response of the sample simultaneously over a broad range of incident and reflected angles and for two orthogonal incident polarizations. The measurement for all radial and azimuthal angles can be performed within a few ms. The system, although currently operating at a relatively low numerical aperture (NA = 0. 4) at wavelength 633 nm allows the reconstruction of the grating shape parameters with nano-meter accuracy, which is comparable to that of measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) as the reference measurements. Additionally, nano-meter accuracy in lateral positioning is proven, which in the present used case corresponds to only 0. 08 % of the period of the grating. In semiconductor lithography, the desired pattern on the wafer is written layer by layer in several steps to realize the finished structure. The positional accuracy of new patterns on the existing ones decides the performance of the circuitry. Deviation of the consecutive layers is called overlay. The allowed deviation is <= 0. 1 % of the critical dimension, which implies the measurement complexity. In chapter 5 of the thesis, a mathematical analysis of the overlay problem shows that the sum of the product of the reflection and transmission coefficients {{plays an important role in}} deciding the magnitude of the asymmetry signal. Here we observe that the overlay signal in CFS is larger in magnitude than that of IOS. With simulations, we have shown that CFS is more sensitive to the overlay as compared to an incoherent case. It is also inferred that, by pupil engineering for incident wavefront on the structure, the sensitivity of the overlay signal can be optimized for a given structure. Optical resolution is limited by the incident wavelength and numerical aperture in a far field optical system. In principle, there are two principal parameters can be tuned to improve the resolution, either by decreasing the wavelength or by increasing the NA of the optical system. In chapter 6 of the thesis, we implement a micro solid immersion lens (SIL) to improve the resolution in a scanning near field microscope setup. Numerical and experimental results show the increased resolution, the improvement in the resolution is based on the focused spot size and visibility studies in the SIL based microscope compared to the confocal imaging. It has been shown that micro-SIL can be used for metrology applications with high NA requirement. The idea, implementation and challenges associated with a Fourier scatterometer with a micro-SIL is presented in the chapter. The fabrication process for the grating involves chemical and plasma treatment which can seldomly result in an unwanted surface over-layer on the nominal structure. When the feature size of the grating is in few tens of nano-meters, an additional layer of few nano-meters on the grating is expected to change the far field diffraction of the grating, compared to an absence of the surface over-layer. In CFS the shape parameters are determined inversely from the far field intensity in grating reconstruction. In the chapter 7 of the thesis, assuming that the distribution of the surface layers (for example: native silicon oxide, contamination and traces of resist removal) are identical on the wafer area with and without the structure, the effect of the thickness of oxide layer on the Si-etched grating is studied and investigated using inverse grating reconstruction. Optical properties of the surface over-layer are measured by ellipsometry and the error, and the accuracy in grating parameters reconstruction in presence of an oxide layer is presented. Finally the grating parameters reconstruction shows that effect of the surface over-layer is crucial for the determination of right set of grating parameters. The accuracy in determination of the refractive index of the over-layer is a critical issue for the actual height determination of the over-layer. Once determined, then CFS is able to resolve few nano-meters of unintentional surface over-layer on the grating structure. Although the studies in the thesis are carried out for periodic structures such as gratings, the applications of CFS are not limited to periodic structures but can also can be applied to multilayer structures analysis, material sciences, photonics industry, bio-sensing, detection of isolated structures and other forms of non-contact metrology. Nevertheless, CFS can also be extended to the interferometric Fourier scatterometry and the ellipsometric Fourier scatterometry with slight modification in the design of the scatterometer for additional functionality and increased sensitivity.

Among various microorganisms, fungi {{have been found to}} be comparatively more efficient in the {{synthesis of}} nanomaterials. In this research work, extracellular mycosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was probed by reacting the precursor salt of silver nitrate (AgNO 3) with culture filtrate of Aspergillus flavus. Initially, the mycosynthesis was regularly monitored by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, which showed AgNP peaks of around 400 – 470 nm. X-ray diffraction spectra revealed peaks of different intensities with respect to <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>diffractions</b> (2 θ) corresponding to varying configurations of AgNPs. Transmission electron micrographs further confirmed the formation of AgNPs in size ranging from 5 – 30 nm. Combined and individual antibacterial activities of the five conventional antibiotics and AgNPs were investigated against eight different multidrug-resistant bacterial species using the Kirby–Bauer disk-diffusion method. The decreasing order of antibacterial activity (zone of inhibition in mm) of antibiotics, AgNPs, and their conjugates against bacterial group (average) was; ciprofloxacin + AgNPs (23) > imipenem + AgNPs (21) > gentamycin + AgNPs (19) > vancomycin + AgNPs (16) > AgNPs (15) > imipenem (14) > trimethoprim + AgNPs (14) > ciprofloxacin (13) > gentamycin (11) > vancomycin (4) > trimethoprim (0). Overall, the synergistic effect of antibiotics and nanoparticles resulted in a 0. 2 – 7. 0 (average, 2. 8) fold-area increase in antibacterial activity, which clearly revealed that nanoparticles can be effectively used in combination with antibiotics in order to improve their efficacy against various pathogenic microbes.

Time-resolved counting of scattered photons alters {{the state of the}} atoms without particle loss implementing a quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement. The conditional dynamics is given by the interplay between photodetection events (quantum jumps) and no-count processes. The class of emerging atomic many-body states can be chosen via the optical geometry and light frequencies. Light detection along the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> a <b>diffraction</b> maximum (Bragg angle) creates an atom-number squeezed state, while light detection at diffraction minima leads to the macroscopic superposition states (Schroedinger cat states) of different atom numbers in the cavity mode. A measurement of the cavity transmission intensity can lead to atom-number squeezed or macroscopic superposition states depending on its outcome. We analyze the robustness of the superposition with respect to missed counts and find that a transmission measurement yields more robust and controllable superposition states than the ones obtained by scattering at a diffraction minimum.
