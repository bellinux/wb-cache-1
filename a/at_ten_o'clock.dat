25|$|A unforecast typhoon struck on 9 October {{and after}} various early {{manoeuvres}} the ship lay a-hull {{in the hope}} of drifting down the centre of the Taiwan Strait until the storm - which the captain thought would cross the strait and land near Xiamen - had passed. Unluckily the storm was recurving and passing up the west coast of Taiwan. The expected drift in a generally south west direction was actually between south and south south west straight towards the Penghu Islands. The winds worsened on the 10th and as the ship rolled violently the ships boats were smashed and the deckhouse damaged. <b>At</b> <b>ten</b> <b>o'clock</b> {{on the night of the}} 10 October three huge waves boarded the ship, smashed the engine and boiler room skylights and, folding below, doused the boilers, filling the machinery spaces with steam.|$|E
25|$|When the {{conversation}} was ended there followed an exchange of abuse and foul words, until Menéndez ordered his crew to draw their swords and to pay out the cable so as to board at once. The sailors showed some hesitation, so Menéndez sprang down from the bridge to urge them on {{and found that the}} cable was caught in the capstan, which caused some delay. The Frenchmen had also heard the signal and, taking advantage of the momentary pause, cut their cables, passed right through the Spanish fleet, and fled, three vessels turning to the north and the other to the south, with the Spaniards in hot pursuit. Menéndez' two ships took the northerly course, but the three French galleons outsailed him, and at dawn he gave up the chase. He reached the mouth of the St. Johns <b>at</b> <b>ten</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning to pursue his original plan of seizing and fortifying it.|$|E

Eugene Hale moved to immediately proceed to the presidential nominee balloting, and Roscoe Conkling seconded the motion. Newspapers had predicted {{the results of the}} balloting, and the delegates knew that it would take a number of ballots before a victor could be found. The first surprise during the balloting roll call came when John A. Logan of Illinois announced that of his state's forty-two delegates, only twenty-four were in support of Grant. This was not as [...] "solid" [...] as Logan had previously advertised {{to the rest of the}} Grant backers. New York faced a similar situation. Of its seventy delegates, fifty-one supported Grant, seventeen were for Blaine, and the remaining two supported Sherman. Pennsylvania fared even worse, as only thirty-two of the state's fifty-eight delegates put in their support for Grant.|$|E
500|$|Early on June 23, Bibescu also {{attempted}} {{to regain the}} loyalty of his Militia forces by an order to take a renewed oath of allegiance—the officers agreed to do so, but added that under no circumstances did they agree to shed the blood of Romanians. In the afternoon, the Bucharest populace, feeling encouraged by this development, rallied in the streets; around four o'clock, the church bells on Dealul Mitropoliei began sounding the [...] (by banging their tongues on only {{one side of the}} drum). Public readings of the Islaz Proclamation took place, and the Romanian tricolor was paraded throughout the city. <b>At</b> <b>ten</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the evening, Bibescu gave in to the pressures, signed the new constitution, and agreed to support a Provisional Government as imposed on him by Frăția. This effectively disestablished Regulamentul Organic, causing the Russian consul to Bucharest, Charles de Kotzebue, to leave the country for Austrian-ruled Transylvania. Bibescu himself abdicated and left into self-exile.|$|E
500|$|Melissa Rosenberg {{had been}} working on {{adapting}} the novel prior to Twilights release and handed in the draft for New Moon during Twilights opening weekend in November 2008. [...] "I would sit down <b>at</b> <b>ten</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning and work on ... until six o'clock in the evening." [...] Rosenberg spent the months of October though June 2008 alternating between writing for the Showtime television series Dexter, and writing New Moon on weekends. She and Meyer kept in touch during this five-month period. One of the key changes the screenwriter made while adapting the book was the decision to take Edward's voice in Bella's head and make it visual. This change caused the first confrontation between the two main characters, one an [...] "apparition", to be emotional. For the screenplay, the four men who Bella approaches needed to create a significant and dangerous situation, and so Rosenberg gave these men motorcycles. [...] "I added the motorcycles, [...] because... they became an important part of [...] relationship with Jacob." ...|$|E

He was submissive on the way, and when passing the gaol's flower beds, he remarked [...] "what a nice little garden", but said nothing further until reaching the Press room, where he remained until the arrival of chaplain Dean Donaghy. Accounts differ about Kelly's last words. Some newspaper reporters wrote that his last words were [...] "Such is life", while other newspapers recorded that this was his response when the warden told him of the intended hour of his execution, earlier that day. The Argus wrote that Kelly's last words were, [...] "Ah, well, I suppose it has come to this", as the rope was placed round his neck. According to another account, Kelly intended to make a speech, but [...] "made no audible sound." [...] The warden later wrote that Kelly, when prompted to say his last words, mumbled something that was too quiet to discern.|$|E
2500|$|At 9 April 1940, eight Norwegian {{soldiers}} {{lost their}} lives in the battle against German aircraft and warships during the invasion of Norway in Operation Weserübung at Odderøya Fortress. [...] The fortress returned the cannon fire from the German warships and attacks by Luftwaffe bombers. [...] The attack against Kristiansand and Arendal consisted of the light cruiser Karlsruhe, three torpedo boats, and seven smaller vessels, one mothership, and around 1,000 soldiers. Three times between 5:00 and 7:00 in the morning, the German forces tried to penetrate and to put troops ashore, but whenever they chose to turn because of shelling from Odderøya. [...] One of the grenades from Karlsruhe missed the fortress. [...] By accident this grenade hit the upper part of Kristiansand Cathedral's church tower. In addition to the grenade hits at the fortress, a bombshell led to an explosion at the ammunition depot. <b>At</b> <b>ten</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, the commander at the cruiser decided to break through whatever the resistance would be. [...] Meanwhile, defenders at Odderøya got a confusing message about not firing on British or French warships. When the German force attacked again, one of the signal flags was confused with a French flag, and therefore the fire from the fortress was withheld. [...] When the force was landed, it met no resistance, and the Norwegian commander surrendered the fortress. One of the anchors of the German merchant ship MS Seattle (1928) is exhibited by the Western battery of the fortress. During the battle the ship came under crossfire, was shot in fire and sank.|$|E
2500|$|The day of upper-class Parisians {{before the}} Revolution was {{described}} in the early 1780s by Sebastien Mercier in his Tableau de Paris.

At nine o'clock, the limonadiers served coffee and pastries to the first clients. <b>At</b> <b>ten</b> <b>o'clock,</b> the clerks and officials of the courts and administration arrived at work. At noon, the financiers, brokers and bankers took their places at the Bourse and in the financial district of the Saint-Honoré quarter. At two o'clock, work stopped {{in the financial markets}} and offices, and the Parisians departed for lunch, either at home or in restaurants. At five o'clock, the streets were again filled with people, as the wealthier Parisians went to the theater, or for promenades, or to cafés. The city was quiet until nine clock, when the streets filled again, as the Parisians made visits to friends. Dinner, or [...] "souper" [...] began between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock. It was also the hour when the prostitutes came out at the Palais-Royal and other heavily frequented streets. When the souper was finished, between eleven and midnight, most Parisians headed home, with others remained to gamble in the salons of the Palais-Royal. The work day for artisans and laborers was usually twelve hours, from about seven in the morning until seven in the evening, usually with a two-hour break at midday for rest and food.|$|E
