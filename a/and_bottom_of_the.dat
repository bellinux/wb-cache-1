5|$|As {{the team}} {{changed its name}} from the Winia to the Halla the uniforms had minor changes made to them. The logo changed names and the uniforms had colored {{shoulders}} removed from them. The current home jerseys feature a solid blue background with yellow stripes on the cuffs <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body {{as well as a number}} of blue rough shapes behind the gold trim as well as sponsor logos on the shoulders. The away jerseys feature a solid white background with dark blue striped borders on the cuffs <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, it also contains the same rough blue shapes behind the trim. The Halla put the first name of Korean players on the jerseys to avoid confusion as several players share the same family name.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the eye socket of Euchambersia is rather small. The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, {{the top of the}} eye socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further {{to the side of the}} jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E
5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a disorder}} {{that results in}} pain in the heel <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot. The pain is usually most severe with the first steps {{of the day or}} following a period of rest. Pain is also frequently brought on by bending the foot and toes up towards the shin and may be worsened by a tight Achilles tendon. The condition typically comes on slowly. In about a third of people both legs are affected.|$|E

5|$|Three {{months after}} {{receiving}} the All-Star Game, the Hurricanes unveiled the logo for the 2011 game. The logo was designed with some homage to the host team and city hidden within it. The shape of the logo {{is similar to the}} Hurricanes primary logo, along with the team colors of red, black and silver. The banners at the top <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> logo are inspired by the state flag of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|A 1920s {{adaptation}} {{created by}} the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by Linotype, that has remained popular. It is sharp, somewhat angular design with a crisp hook rather than a teardrop at top left of the 'a'. Stempel Garamond has relatively short descenders, allowing it to be particularly tightly linespaced. An unusual feature is the digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of {{the number on the}} top <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digit to make it more distinguishable from a 'o'. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel's head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.|$|E
5|$|All {{described}} {{specimens of}} Sinosauropteryx preserve integumentary structures (filaments {{arising from the}} skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of feathers. These short, down-like filaments are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and top <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified {{on the sides of}} the body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the randomness of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.|$|E

5|$|Families {{throughout}} Han China made ritual sacrifices {{of animals}} and food to deities, spirits, and ancestors at temples and shrines, {{in the belief that}} these items could be utilized by those in the spiritual realm. It was thought that each person had a two-part soul: the spirit-soul (hun 魂) which journeyed to the afterlife paradise of immortals (xian), and the body-soul (po 魄) which remained in its grave or tomb on earth and was only reunited with the spirit-soul through a ritual ceremony. These tombs were commonly adorned with uniquely decorated hollow clay tiles that function also as a doorjamb to the tomb. Otherwise known as tomb tiles, these artifacts feature holes in the top <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tile allowing it to pivot. Similar tiles have been found in the Chengdu area of Sichuan province in south-central China.|$|E
5|$|Variations of this flag {{were used}} during the Belarusian People's Republic in 1918–1919. The white-red-white flag is still used by the Republic's government-in-exile. Lasting from 1919 until 1925, {{the flag of the}} BPR {{retained}} the white, red, white design, but with the addition of black stripes at the top <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> red stripe. Between 1921 and 1939 the white-red-white flag was used by the Belarusian national movement in West Belarus (part of the Second Polish Republic), both by political organizations like the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union or the Belarusian Christian Democracy, and non-political organizations like the Belarusian Schools Society. The flag was also used by the Belarusian Special Battalion in the army of the Republic of Lithuania. After the invasion of Poland and the annexation of modern-day West Belarus in 1939 the flag was forbidden by the Soviet administration in the newly acquired territories as well.|$|E
5|$|York {{appointed}} former Manchester United manager Wilf McGuinness in February 1975, and {{he helped}} them stay in the Second Division in 1974–75. However, York faced successive relegations under McGuinness, when finishing 21st in 1975–76 <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Division in 1976–77. He was dismissed in October 1977, with York 22nd in the Fourth Division, and was succeeded by former Charlton Athletic player Charlie Wright in November. He could not prevent a re-election bid after 1977–78, before leading York to 10th place the following season. Wright was dismissed in March 1980 with the team {{near the bottom of}} the table, and under caretaker manager Barry Lyons York finished 17th in 1979–80. He was appointed permanently in May 1980, and York finished bottom of the table in his first full season in charge. York continued to struggle and Lyons was dismissed in December 1981; Kevin Randall and Barry Swallow each had spells in caretaker charge, before York finished 17th in 1981–82.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, with Ken Bates now {{owner of}} the club, Chelsea's crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and because the old rampant lion badge could not be trademarked. The new badge {{featured}} a more naturalistic non-heraldic lion, in white and not blue, standing over the C.F.C. initials. This lasted for the next 19 years, with some modifications {{such as the use}} of different colours, including red from 1987 to 1995, and yellow from 1995 until 1999, before the white returned. With the new ownership of Roman Abramovich, and the club's centenary approaching, combined with demands from fans for the popular 1950s badge to be restored, it was decided that the crest should be changed again in 2005. The new crest was officially adopted for the start of the 2005–06 season and marked a return to the older design, used from 1953 to 1986, featuring a blue heraldic lion holding a staff. For the centenary season this was accompanied by the words '100 YEARS' and 'CENTENARY 2005–2006' on the top <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crest respectively.|$|E

Similarly, when the flag is to be lowered from half-staff, it should be first briefly hoisted {{to the top of}} the staff.|$|E

25|$|A Trombe wall is {{a passive}} solar heating and {{ventilation}} system consisting of an air channel sandwiched between a window and a sun-facing thermal mass. During the ventilation cycle, sunlight stores heat in the thermal mass and warms the air channel causing circulation through vents at the top <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall. During the heating cycle the Trombe wall radiates stored heat.|$|E

25|$|In early 1970 it {{was decided}} to change the planned name of the film and the {{associated}} album from Get Back to Let It Be, matching the group's March 1970 single release. The final version of the film was blown-up from full-frame 16mm to 35 mm film for theatrical release, which increased the film's graininess. To create the wider theatrical aspect ratio, the top <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frame was cropped, necessitating the repositioning of every single shot for optimal picture composition.|$|E
25|$|For the Nr I type trams, HKL {{decided to}} adopt a new livery.
