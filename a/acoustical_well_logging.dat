This paper investigates using a co-evolutionary fuzzy system to generate a <b>well</b> <b>log</b> interpreter that can automatically process <b>well</b> <b>log</b> data and interpret reservoir permeability. The methodology consists of 3 steps: 1) transform <b>well</b> <b>log</b> data into fuzzy symbols which maintain {{the character of the}} original log curves; 2) apply a co-evolutionary fuzzy system to generate a fuzzy rule set that classifies permeability ranges; 3) use the fuzzy rule set to interpret <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> and infer the permeability ranges. We present the developed techniques and test them on <b>well</b> <b>log</b> data collected from oil fields in offshore West Africa. The generated fuzzy rules give sensible interpretation.

This paper presents an automatic blocking scheme that transforms numerical <b>well</b> <b>log</b> data into a fuzzy symbolic representation.

Additionally, fuzzy sym-bols allow effective interpretation under uncertainty embedded in the data set and our knowledge of the earth’s subsurface.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 101 - 106). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This research presents two approaches for working with reservoir properties. The first is the application of decision tree classifiers for predicting partitioning or classifications based on <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> for improving the permeability estimations. The second approach is the application of Markov Random Field (MRF) for determination of a 3 D high-resolution model of porosity using <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> and seismic attributes. The prediction of permeability is a critical aspect of reservoir characterization in complex reservoirs such as carbonate reservoirs. In order to improve the permeability estimation in these reservoirs, several techniques have been proposed to partition <b>well</b> <b>log</b> response into different classes, viz., layering or zoning, electrofacies and hydraulic flow units. It has been shown that the partition approaches are quite promising. However, they are generally defined using a specific set of <b>well</b> <b>logs.</b> For this reason, difficulties arise in the estimation of permeability when there are missing <b>well</b> <b>logs.</b> In this research we developed an approach, using the decision tree classifiers, for solving the problem of missing <b>well</b> <b>logs.</b> We predicted the partitions and estimated the impact of missing <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> at two complex carbonate reservoirs in west Texas, viz., Salt Creek Field Unit (SCFU) and North Robertson Unit (NRU). Porosity is another important reservoir property that is obtained from different sources in an oil field; the most common source being <b>well</b> <b>logs.</b> In some reservoirs porosity data from <b>well</b> <b>logs</b> is available only for few wells. Reservoir porosity models built using sparse well information can be highly uncertain. Therefore, we need to integrate information from different scales or sources to get an accurate spatial distribution for porosity. A common source of such additional information is seismic data. There are several techniques available for integrating seismic and <b>well</b> <b>log</b> data e. g., cokriging and its variants. These techniques are reasonably accurate but only when there are enough wells for determining the semivariogram from <b>well</b> <b>logs.</b> In this research, the concept of Markov Random Field (MRF) was used {{to solve the problem of}} reservoir not having enough wells for applying conventional geostatistical techniques of integration. We generated a 3 D high-resolution model for porosity using neutron logs and the maximum seismic amplitude for a reservoir in the Middle East...|$|R
