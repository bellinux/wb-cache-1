40|$|Photoperiod {{response}} {{is a key}} determinant for barley adaptation to diverse environments. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for response to long photoperiod was identified in Australia (Perth, 31 A degrees 56 'S) and China (Wuhan, 30 A degrees 33 'N) using 178 doubled haploid lines derived from a cross of an Australian barley, Baudin, and a Canadian barley, AC Metcalfe. The QTL was detected as a major QTL in the 18 -h photoperiod glasshouse experiments and mapped to the Xp 12 m 50 B 199 -Xp 13 m 47 B 399 interval on chromosome 4 H with a LOD score of 57 in Australia and confirmed in China. The single QTL accounted for 77. 48 and 37. 81 % of phenotypic variation for long photoperiod response in Australia and China, respectively. The same QTL also controlled heading date in Australia, under normal and extended photoperiod conditions, and in China, under extended photoperiod and late-sown conditions. The QTL <b>advanced</b> <b>heading</b> date by 27. 8 days in Australia and 42. 5 days in China under a 18 -h photoperiod. In addition, QTL for heading date were identified on chromosomes 2 H and 3 H. The chromosome 3 H QTL {{was associated with the}} denso gene and detected in all conditions, but the chromosome 2 H QTL was only detected in Australia. The new photoperiod response QTL, Qhea.

40|$|Maize {{phenology}} observations at 112 national agro-meteorological experiment stations across China {{spanning the}} years 1981 - 2009 {{were used to}} investigate the spatiotemporal changes of maize phenology, {{as well as the}} relations to temperature change and cultivar shift. The greater scope of the dataset allows us to estimate the effects of temperature change and cultivar shift on maize phenology more precisely. We found that maize sowing date advanced significantly at 26. 0 % of stations mainly for spring maize in northwestern, southwestern and northeastern China, although delayed significantly at 8. 0 % of stations mainly in northeastern China and the North China Plain (NCP). Maize maturity date delayed significantly at 36. 6 % of stations mainly in the northeastern China and the NCP. As a result, duration of maize whole growing period (GPw) was prolonged significantly at 41. 1 % of stations, although mean temperature (Tmean) during GPw increased at 72. 3 % of stations, significantly at 19. 6 % of stations, and Tmean was negatively correlated with the duration of GPw at 92. 9 % of stations and significantly at 42. 9 % of stations. Once disentangling the effects of temperature change and cultivar shift with an approach based on accumulated thermal development unit, we found that increase in temperature <b>advanced</b> <b>heading</b> date and maturity date and reduced the duration of GPw at 81. 3 %, 82. 1 % and 83. 9 % of stations on average by 3. 2, 6. 0 and 3. 5 days/decade, respectively. By contrast, cultivar shift delayed heading date and maturity date and prolonged the duration of GPw at 75. 0 %, 94. 6 % and 92. 9 % of stations on average by 1. 5, 6. 5 and 6. 5 days/decade, respectively. Our results suggest that maize production is adapting to ongoing climate change by shift of sowing date and adoption of cultivars with longer growing period. The spatiotemporal changes of maize phenology presented here can further guide the development of adaptation options for maize production in near future...|$|E

40|$|Background/Aims: To {{identify}} physician selection {{factors in}} the treatment of locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer and how treatment outcome is affected by Tumor Board recommendations. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 213 patients treated for locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer in a single institution was performed. All treatments followed Tumor Board recommendations: 115 patients had chemotherapy and radiation, and 98 patients received postoperative radiation. Patient characteristics, treatment toxicity, locoregional control and survival between these two treat- ment groups were compared. Patient survival was compared with survival data reported in randomized studies of locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer. Results: There were no differences in comorbidity factors, and T or N stages between the two groups. A statistically significant number of patients with oropharyngeal and oral cavity tumors had chemoradiation and postoperative radiation, respectively (p < 0. 0001). Grade 3 - 4 toxicities during treatment were 48 and 87 % for the postoperative radiation and chemoradiation groups, respectively (p = 0. 0001). There were no differences in survival, locoregional recurrences and distant metastases between the two groups. Patient survival was comparable to survival rates reported by randomized studies of locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer. Conclusion: Disease sites remained the key determining factor for treatment selection. Multidisciplinary approaches provided optimal treatment outcome for locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer, with overall survival in these patients being comparable to that reported in randomized clinical trials.

40|$|Abstract: Background. Although {{meta-analysis}} {{showed that}} survival improved with concurrent chemoradiation in locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is still unique, because it renders curative surgery feasible for mar-ginally resectable {{head and neck}} cancer patients. Methods. We reviewed patients with locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer, who had been treated with neoadjuvant chem-otherapy between June 1984 and February 2001 at the Seoul National University Hospital. Results. A total of 167 patients were included. After 2 to 3 chemotherapy cycles, either surgery (38 patients) or radiation (104 patients) was conducted. Those who received surgery exhibited better survival than those who received radiation [me-dian survival: not reached vs 33. 6 months (95 % CI: 22. 6 – 44. 7), p 5. 006].

30|$|Though Surgery with {{post-operative}} radiotherapy {{has been}} standard approach for locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancers, concurrent chemotherapy with radiotherapy {{can be an}} alternative according to recent NCCN guidelines 2014, but the role of brachytherapy boost {{is yet to be}} defined. EBRT with HDR brachytherapy boost has been shown to provide better local control rates compared to external beam radiation alone in locally advanced oral cavity cancers (Donath et al. 1995). Also, concurrent chemo radiation with Injection Cisplatin has proven its superiority over radiotherapy alone in locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancers (Studer et al. 2007). However, very few studies have utilized concurrent chemo radiation with brachytherapy boost in these situations.|$|R
30|$|Hyperfractionated RT has {{resulted}} in increased severe acute complications requiring intensive nutritional support for the completion of treatment in some patients. Wang et al. suggested that a prolongation of the treatment gap for more than 14  days adversely affected the local control in patients with locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer treated with accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy, and the midcourse treatment gap should be kept as short as possible (Wang et al. 1996). In a Phase III trial of hyperfractionated RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy for locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer, combined treatment for <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer was more efficacious than hyperfractionated RT alone (Brizel et al. 1998). This trial included planned treatment breaks to avoid {{the withdrawal of the}} recruited subjects due to acute toxicity; eventually, the treatment time of RT in the hyperfractionated RT arm averaged 42  days, while that in the hyperfractionated RT plus concurrent chemotherapy arm averaged 47  days (Brizel et al. 1998). However, the long-term follow-up in the Phase III Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0129 trial indicated no difference in the overall survival or late toxicity with the use of accelerated-hyperfractionated vs standard RT plus cisplatin in patients with locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer (Nguyen-Tan et al. 2014). Based on {{the results of the present}} study of CCRT using hyperfractionated RT and daily carboplatin, we believe that when a treatment interruption is needed because of the acute toxicities, hyperfractionated RT should be resumed as soon as possible independently while continuing the break of daily carboplatin.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Background and Aims: Chemotherapy is {{utilized}} {{as a part}} of combined-modality {{programs to}} achieve organ preservation and improve survival in patients with locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancer. Combined-modality protocols can be used in three forms: a) neoadjuvant induction chemotherapy before definitive surgery or radiotherapy; b) concomitant chemoradiotherapy; and c) sequential therapy consisting of induction chemotherapy and chemoradiation. The aim of this article was to study the role of these methods in treatment of locoregionally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancers. Methods: An extensive search was performed on PubMed using five key phrases of head and neck, carcinoma, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, induction chemotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. The search results were limited to randomized trials and meta-analysis. Results: Despite an improvement in organ preservation, induction treatment has no impact on survival. Chemoradiation provides higher survival and increased rate of organ preservation compared to radiation alone. Ongoing phase III comparisons of sequential therapy with chemoradiotherapy may help identify the superior approach. Conclusion: Although further studies in this field are required, taxane-based sequential therapy can be currently used as a reasonable alternative to chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally <b>advanced</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancers.
