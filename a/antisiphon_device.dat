40|$|Patients with {{hydrocephalus}} {{and risk}} factors for overdrainage may be submitted to ventricular shunt (VS) implant with <b>antisiphon</b> <b>device.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to prospectively evaluate for two years the clinical and tomographic results of the implant of fixed-pressure valves with <b>antisiphon</b> <b>device</b> SPHERAÂ® in 35 adult patients, with hydrocephalus and {{risk factors for}} overdrainage. Of these, 3 had congenital hydrocephalus in adult patients with very dilated ventricles (Evans index > 50 %), 3 had symptomatic overdrainage after previous VS implant (subdural hematoma, hygroma or slit ventricle syndrome), 1 had previous chronic subdural hematoma, 15 had normal pressure hydrocephalus with final lumbar pressure < 5 cm H 2 O after tap test (40 mL), 6 had pseudotumor cerebri, and 7 had hydrocephalus due to other causes. Clinical improvement was observed and sustained in 94. 3 % of the patients during the two-year period with no computed tomography (CT) evidence of hypo or overdrainage, and no immediate early or late significant complications...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although about 80 % of {{properly}} diagnosed {{patients with}} hydrocephalus improve after implantation of any model of shunt, the remaining 20 % may develop further complications because of inadequate shunt performance. Therefore, hydrocephalus shunts require careful independent laboratory evaluation. METHOD: Computer supported shunt testing, {{based on the}} new International Standard Organisation directives, characterises various aspects of pressure-flow performance of shunts such as variability with time, susceptibility to reflux, siphoning, temperature related behaviour, external pressure, {{the influence of a}} strong magnetic field (for example, MRI), presence of pulsation in differential pressure, particles in drained fluid, etc. RESULTS: Seven different models of valves, representing most common constructions, have been tested so far. Most contemporary valves have a hydrodynamic resistance which is too low. This may result in overdrainage both related to posture and during nocturnal cerebral vasogenic waves. A long distal catheter increases the resistance of these valves by 100 %- 200 %. Most shunts are very sensitive to the presence of air bubbles and small particles in drained fluid. Few shunt models offer reasonable resistance to negative outlet pressure, preventing complications related to overdrainage. Valves with an <b>antisiphon</b> <b>device</b> may be blocked by raised subcutaneous pressure. All programmable valves are susceptible to overdrainage in an upright position. CONCLUSION: The behaviour of a valve during such testing is of immediate relevance to the surgeon and may not be adequately described in the manufacturer's product information...|$|E
40|$|Ventriculo-peritoneal {{shunting}} is {{the most}} commonly used method for the treatment of paediatric hydrocephalus. Despite improved shunts and surgical techniques there are still complications. This retrospective study focuses on diagnoses and treatment of shunt malfunction and infections. Cost/benefit of using an adjustable shunt was assessed. Two adjustable cerebrospinal fluid shunts and their compatible antisiphon devices were compared in-vitro. In 21 of 46 children the standard shunt was changed to an adjustable one due to over-drainage. Adjustment of the shunt was performed in 73 % of the children thereby avoiding surgery in several cases. This was a financial advantage. Ascites or an abdominal pseudocyst without infection was detected in eight children due to resorption difficulties. A ventriculo-atrial shunt was inserted for a period of time. In three children it could successfully be reverted to a ventriculo-peritoneal. In six children papilloedema was the only sign of shunt dysfunction. At revision the intracranial pressure ranged from 25 to 52 cm H 2 O. Fundoscopic examination in children older than 8 years may detect symptomless shunt malfunction. During a 13 -year period 39 shunt infections were diagnosed. Skin bacteria were found in 80 %. Prolonged and anaerobic cultures increased the detection rate by more than one third. The intraventricular infections were treated with intraventricular and systemic antibiotics resulting in quick sterilisation. No relapses were encountered. In five older children with distal catheter infection Propionibacterium acne was found. These were treated with intravenous antibiotics and exchanging of the shunt system. Strata NSCTM and Codman HakimTM worked according to the manufacturers except at the lowest setting. The resistance was below and in the lower range of the physiological one respectively. The <b>antisiphon</b> <b>device</b> of Strata shunt had to be placed in line with shunt to function properly...|$|E
