During this, Columbus is startled by the noises of a rat and accidentally shoots at the last {{remaining}} box of Twinkies in the pantry, destroying all the cakes and making them inedible.

Ward then got angry, and decided to pack his things, and get on a bus to leave. The group then brought in drummer Vinny Appice to replace Ward.|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{wrote that}} [...] "Big Fat Bass" [...] is [...] "the most old-school work" [...] on Femme Fatale, with Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{considering}} the album's production [...] "polished, intriguing and – {{best of all}} – fun", exemplifying the piano breakdown in the song. Keith Caulfield of Billboard said he could [...] "completely hear this track blasting in a club, with Spears cooing 'I can be your treble' while the crowd screams back 'you can be my bass!'." [...] The Daily Collegians stated that the song is [...] "catchy", yet different from [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] and [...] "Hold It Against Me", and added that [...] "the combined star power of Spears and Will.i.am would have surely made it a radio hit." [...] The Independent journalist Andy Gill noted that the album sounds more programmed than natural, but said that the song [...] "sticks to dancefloor essentials". David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound thought that the song [...] "might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> B-side to 'The Time (Dirty Bit)' (otherwise known as the most annoying Black Eyed Peas song ever created)." [...] Both Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic and About.com reviewer Bill Lamb selected it as a top song on Femme Fatale. Lamb further added that the song [...] "will leave you laughing as you sing along on the dance floor." ...|$|E

500|$|The term 'heavy metal', as it {{was used}} by Lester Bangs and Dave Marsh at Creem, {{referred}} to a sound best exemplified by albums such as Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin II, Deep Purple's Deep Purple in Rock, and Black Sabbath's Paranoid. An examination {{of some of the}} lyrics from bands such as these show a lack of any explicitly negative themes. Led Zeppelin's [...] "Whole Lotta Love" [...] could just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> conversation between husband and wife, as not. Black Sabbath's [...] "Electric Funeral" [...] exactly parallels the blood red moon of the Book of Revelation by John of Patmos, while their [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] describes the ravages of drug abuse. Ozzy Osbourne could be heard preaching to his audience in the earlier song, [...] "Children of the Grave": [...] "Tell the world that love is still alive you must be brave; or the children of today are children of the grave." [...] Later, in the song [...] "In My Time of Dying", Robert Plant even pleaded to Jesus: [...] "Meet me Jesus, meet me; Meet me {{in the middle of the}} air; if my wings should fail me Lord, please meet me with another pair." [...] Perhaps not overtly Christian, but songs such as these exhibited similar themes. Early heavy metal fans were viewed by the populace as a counterculture, just as the fans of rock and roll, in general, were. Early heavy metal lyrics and themes were often accused of challenging Christian values, and as the genre grew, some bands actually did.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{particularly}} negative review, Richard Cobbett of PC Gamer {{described it as}} being [...] "not really a game, although it has {{a few of them}} in it, but more of an interactive comedy CD-ROM", although conceding that even the parody sketches are [...] "stuck mining geek humour" [...] which Cobbett felt [...] "smacks of non-technical people desperately trying to write jokes in what may <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> foreign language". Meanwhile, David Reynolds of MacAddict deemed the program [...] "predictably tepid", [...] "mildly entertaining", and only slightly amusing, noting how unforgiving parody can be.

2500|$|From 1925 to 1928 he was passionately {{involved}} with Dalí. The friendship with Lorca {{had a strong}} element of mutual passion, but Dalí [...] rejected the erotic advances of the poet. With the success of [...] "Gypsy Ballads", came an estrangement from Dalí and the breakdown of {{a love affair with}} sculptor Emilio Aladrén Perojo. These brought on an increasing depression, a situation exacerbated by his anguish over his homosexuality. He felt he was trapped between the persona of the successful author, which he was forced to maintain in public, and the tortured, authentic self, which he could only acknowledge in private. He also had the sense that he was being pigeon-holed as a [...] "gypsy poet". He wrote: [...] "The gypsies are a theme. And nothing more. I could just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> poet of sewing needles or hydraulic landscapes. Besides, this gypsyism gives me the appearance of an uncultured, ignorant and primitive poet that you know very well I'm not. I don't want to be typecast". Growing estrangement between García Lorca and his closest friends reached its climax when surrealists Dalí and Luis Buñuel collaborated on their 1929 film Un Chien Andalou (An Andalusian Dog). García Lorca interpreted it, perhaps erroneously, as a vicious attack upon himself. At this time Dalí also met his future wife Gala. Aware of these problems (though not perhaps of their causes), García Lorca's family arranged for him to take a lengthy visit to the United States in 1929–30.|$|E
