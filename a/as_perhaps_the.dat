5|$|Giacomo Meyerbeer (born Jacob Liebmann Beer; 5 September 1791 – 2 May 1864) was a German opera {{composer}} of Jewish birth who {{has been}} described <b>as</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most successful stage composer of the nineteenth century. With his 1831 opera Robert le diable and its successors, he gave the genre of grand opera 'decisive character'. Meyerbeer's grand opera style was achieved by his merging of German orchestra style with Italian vocal tradition. These were employed {{in the context of}} sensational and melodramatic libretti created by Eugène Scribe and were enhanced by the up-to-date theatre technology of the Paris Opéra. They set a standard which helped to maintain Paris as the opera capital of the nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|In 1860–61 the {{legislature}} started formal military {{training at the}} school with a law amending the original 1851 statute. During the Civil War, the seminary became The Florida Military and Collegiate Institute. Enrollment at the school increased to around 250 students with the school establishing itself <b>as</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> largest and most respected educational institution in the state. Cadets from the school defeated Union forces at the Battle of Natural Bridge in 1865, leaving Tallahassee as the only Confederate capital east of the Mississippi River not to fall to Union forces. The students were trained by Valentine Mason Johnson, a graduate of Virginia Military Institute, who was a professor of mathematics and the chief administrator of the college. After {{the fall of the}} Confederacy, campus buildings were occupied by Union military forces for approximately four months and the West Florida Seminary reverted to its former academic purpose.|$|E
5|$|Attempts to date it have {{undergone}} similar shifts of opinion. In the 19th century the panel {{was believed to}} be an early work by Jan completed as early as c. 1410, although this view changed as scholarship progressed. In the early 20th century, Ludwig von Baldass placed it around 1424–29, then for a long period it was seen as originating from the early 1430s. Erwin Panofsky provided the first detailed treatise on the work and placed it around 1432–34. However, following research from Meyer Schapiro, he revised his opinion to the late 1430s in the 1953 edition of his Early Netherlandish Painting. A 1970s comparative study of van Eyck's 1437 Saint Barbara concluded that Madonna in the Church was completed after c. 1437. In the 1990s, Otto Pächt judged the work as probably a late van Eyck, given the similar treatment of an interior in the 1434 Arnolfini Portrait. In the early 21st century, Jeffrey Chipps Smith and John Oliver Hand placed it between 1426 and 1428, claiming it <b>as</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> earliest extant signed work confirmed as by Jan.|$|E

25|$|Edward Teach (Thatch), more {{commonly}} known as Blackbeard, was active from 1716 to 1718 <b>as</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most notorious pirate among English-speaking nations. Blackbeard's most famous ship was the Queen Anne's Revenge, named {{in response to the}} end of Queen Anne's War. Blackbeard was killed by one of Lieutenant Robert Maynard's crewmen in 1718.|$|E
25|$|Moxon {{is known}} <b>as</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> unluckiest {{member of the}} '99 club' in that, early in his innings against New Zealand in 1987-88, he swept three runs {{seemingly}} off {{the middle of the}} bat only for the umpire to signal leg byes. Moxon fell for 99, and would become one of eight Test batsman to make 99 but not a century.|$|E

25|$|This {{region is}} {{regarded}} <b>as</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> one most influenced by Native Americans, and its foods are {{closely linked to}} the Andean-Incan tradition. When preparing regional dishes, potatoes and corn or wheat are almost always used, including quinoa (a cereal typically used in Incan cuisine), peppers, squashes and tomatoes. The most celebrated dishes are humita and tamal, in which the corn husk is stuffed with the corn filling itself, seasonings or meat.|$|E
25|$|The first working {{model of}} a laser was {{demonstrated}} by Theodore Maiman in 1960 in Malibu at the Hughes Research Laboratory (now known as HRL Laboratories LLC). In the 1990s HRL Laboratories developed the FastScat computer code, for frequency domain algorithms and implementation, recognized <b>as</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most accurate code {{in the world for}} radar cross-section calculations. TRW built a laboratory in Solstice Canyon without any structural steel to test magnetic detectors for satellites and medical devices.|$|E
25|$|Occupations {{which require}} high {{educational}} attainment are well compensated and {{are held in}} high public esteem. Physicians, lawyers, engineers, scientists and professors are largely considered to be upper middle class. The very well educated are seen as trendsetters; the anti-smoking, pro-fitness, and organic food movements, as well as environmentalism, are largely indigenous to this socio-economic grouping. Education serves <b>as</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most important value and also the most dominant entry barrier of the upper middle class.|$|E
50|$|Julie von May (von Rued) (1808-1875), was a Swiss feminist. In 1868, {{she became}} the {{chairperson}} of the first women's organisation in Switzerland: Association internationale des femmes. She supported women suffrage, but focused on Equality before the law. She has been counted <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most leading feminist of her country in her generation alongside Marie Goegg-Pouchoulin.|$|R

Having published many short stories, novels and essays, Farah's prose has earned him, among other accolades, the Premio Cavour in Italy, the Kurt Tucholsky Prize in Sweden, and in 1998, the prestigious Neustadt International Prize for Literature. In the same year, the French edition of his novel Gifts also won the St. Malo Literature Festival's prize.|$|E
25|$|At {{the center}} of the {{district}} lay the four palaces at Amalienborg, including the Moltke Palace, today known as Christian VII’s Palace, surrounding the octagonal Amalienborg Plaza. In the middle of the plaza Moltke’s Danish Asiatic Company erected a monumental equestrian statue of Frederick VI designed by Jacques François Joseph Saly. The four palaces surrounding the plaxa were identical from the outside, but different on the inside. Moltke’s Palace was the most expensive, and had the most extravagant interiors. Its Great Hall (Riddersalen) is acknowledged widely <b>as</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> finest Danish rococo interior.|$|E
25|$|The Elgin Road {{residence}} of Subhas Chandra Bose in Calcutta {{was the place}} from where he escaped the British to reach Germany during the Second World War. He was the co-founder of the Indian National Army and the Head of State of the Arzi Hukumate Azad Hind, formed to counter and combat the British Raj in India. Renamed Netaji by poet laureate Rabindranath Tagore, he is regarded by many <b>as</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most prominent and influential freedom fighter in Indian history and is venerated in many Bengali households even today.|$|E

25|$|Among his followers, the {{composer}} and pianist Fernando Otero and Piazzolla's protégé, bandoneonist Marcelo Nisinman, {{are the best}} known innovators of the tango music of the new millennium, while Pablo Ziegler, pianist with Piazzolla's second quintet, has {{assumed the role of}} principal custodian of nuevo tango, extending the jazz influence in the style. The Brazilian guitarist Sergio Assad has also experimented with folk-derived, complex virtuoso compositions that show Piazzolla's structural influence while steering clear of tango sounds; and Osvaldo Golijov has acknowledged Piazzolla <b>as</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> greatest influence on his globally oriented, eclectic compositions for classical and klezmer performers.|$|E
25|$|Ice is {{a hazard}} to sailors venturing far below 40° south. Although the ice limit dips south around the horn, icebergs are a {{significant}} hazard for vessels in the area. In the South Pacific in February (summer in Southern Hemisphere), icebergs are generally confined to below 50° south; but in August the iceberg hazard can extend north of 40° south. Even in February, the Horn is well below the latitude of the iceberg limit. These hazards have made the Horn notorious <b>as</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most dangerous ship passage in the world; many ships were wrecked, and many sailors died attempting to round the Cape.|$|E
25|$|Remains of walled towns, fortresses, palaces, tombs, and {{artifacts}} {{have been found}} in North Korea and Manchuria, including ancient paintings in a Goguryeo tomb complex in Pyongyang. Some ruins are also still visible in present-day China, for example at Wunü Mountain, suspected to be the site of Jolbon fortress, near Huanren in Liaoning province on the present border with North Korea. Ji'an is also home to a large collection of Goguryeo era tombs, including what Chinese scholars consider to be the tombs of Gwanggaeto and his son Jangsu, as well <b>as</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> best-known Goguryeo artifact, the Gwanggaeto Stele, {{which is one of the}} primary sources for pre-5th-century Goguryeo history.|$|E

25|$|In 1949, Brodovitch collaborated in the {{production}} of the revolutionary publication Portfolio. It has been widely acknowledged <b>as</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> definitive graphic design magazine of the twentieth century. The idea for the publication came from art director Frank Zachary. He wanted to put out a magazine that focused solely on art and design, but was at the same time an outstanding example of design itself. Brodovitch was intrigued by the concept. Although he enjoyed his work at Harper's Bazaar, the limitations of space and subject matter often cramped his creative style. Portfolio freed him from the practical and aesthetic restraints to which he had grown accustomed. The pages of the publication were space for his graphic imagination to run wild. George S. Rosenthal, whose family owned a printing company dedicated to mass-market pictorial paperbacks, signed on too.|$|E
25|$|King was {{repeatedly}} rejected in auditions for the South Side's Chess Records, the premier blues label, {{which was the}} home of Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Little Walter. The complaint was that King sang too much like B.B. King. A newer blues scene, lively with nightclubs and upstart record companies, was burgeoning on the West Side, though. The bassist and producer Willie Dixon, {{during a period of}} estrangement from Chess in the late 1950s, asked King to come to Cobra Records for a session, but the results have never been heard. Meanwhile, King established himself <b>as</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> biggest musical force on the West Side. He played along with Magic Sam and reputedly played backing guitar, uncredited, on some of Sam's tracks for Mel London's Chief and Age labels, though King does not stand out on them.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} season – {{one with}} hardly {{a day of}} rain in the Home Counties after early May – bore out almost all that was thought of Knox. When sound, he was clearly the fastest bowler seen {{for a long time}} in county cricket and, even on much truer Oval pitches, he was able to make the ball rise dangerously. He could also spin the ball back from the off as much as Richardson at his best. Early in the season, Knox’s bowling was beyond everything else the factor behind Surrey rising to the top of the table, and at times – notably against Leicestershire and Sussex at the Oval – his pace could bowl sides out cheaply on even the best of pitches. However, from the middle of June, the strain of bowling on such hard, sun-soaked pitches took its toll and Knox suffered constantly from shin strains. These strains kept him out of nine of Surrey’s last sixteen matches and according to Wisden, Knox “often played when he should have been resting.” Nonetheless, his twelve wickets for 174 against the Players at Lord's in July is still remembered <b>as</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> fastest bowling ever seen in the history of Gentlemen v Players games: some of the professional batsmen were literally intimidated. Knox was rewarded for this and his superb early season form with nomination as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, truck systems were widely seen, in industrialised countries, <b>as</b> exploitative; <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most {{well-known}} {{example of this}} view was a 1947 U.S. hit song [...] "Sixteen Tons". Many countries have Truck Act legislation that outlaws truck systems and requires payment in cash.|$|R
