500|$|Jean's father, Albert Balukas, {{along with}} his partner, {{professional}} player Frank McGown, was the proprietor of a forty-eight-table pool hall called the Ovington Lounge in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, New York. Balukas's introduction to play was at 4 years of age, not {{on one of her}} father's tables but on a 4-1⁄2by9foot pool table in the cellar of her childhood home, purchased by her parents to keep her four billiards-playing brothers out of local pool rooms. In later years Balukas explained that she [...] "almost never went to the pool hall <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> go, I didn't play. I felt uncomfortable, and besides, girls didn't go in those days." ...|$|E
500|$|Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones, an American nuclear {{physicist}} assisting Bond in his mission. Richards {{stated that}} she liked the role because it was [...] "brainy", [...] "athletic", and had [...] "depth of character, in contrast to Bond girls from previous decades". Richards stated {{that a lot of}} viewers [...] "made fun of" [...] the character's attire but that [...] "These Bond girls are so outrageous <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> really look like a scientist, the Bond fans would have been disappointed." [...] Writer Ben Bussey stated in a Yahoo! Movies article that [...] "it's clear that Eon were never aiming especially high with this character" [...] since the company [...] "reportedly" [...] auditioned Geri Halliwell and Tiffani Thiessen for the role.|$|E

During the song, she urges the listeners to [...] "making [...] voices heard before someone does it for [...] " [...] with her voice [...] "echoing like the announcer in the ring." [...] In another part, during the motivational encouragement, she informs that [...] "there's only two letters difference between 'I Can't' and 'Icon'," [...] while also inspiring the listeners {{to find their own}} greatness, singing: [...] "Just shine your light like a beautiful star / Show the world who you are." [...] Tyson opening speech talks about how he's ‘the best the world's ever seen' and that he [...] "worked hard and sweated [...] tears." [...] He later proclames: [...] "I'm never falling again <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> I'll come back." [...] Chance, on the other hand, raps about idolatry.|$|E

500|$|The Mavericks swept Kevin Garnett and the Minnesota Timberwolves in {{the first}} round of the 2002 NBA Playoffs 3–0: Nowitzki outscored Garnett with 33.3 points per game versus 24.0. In the second round, the Mavericks met the Sacramento Kings with rival power forward Chris Webber. After {{splitting}} the first two games, Kings coach Rick Adelman changed his defensive scheme: before, Webber had defended Nowitzki one-on-one, but now, the Kings coach ordered his smaller but quicker player Hedo Türkoğlu to cover Nowitzki. Türkoğlu would use his agility to play Nowitzki tightly, and if the taller Maverick tried to post up Türkoğlu, Webber would double team Nowitzki. In Game 3 in Dallas, the Mavericks lost, 125–119; Nowitzki scored only 19 points and said: [...] "I simply could not pass Türkoğlu, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> I ran into a double team and committed too many turnovers." [...] In Game 4, more frustration awaited the German: the Mavericks gave away a 14-point lead, although the entire Kings starting frontcourt of center Vlade Divac and power forward Chris Webber (both fouled out) and small forward Peja Stojaković (injury) were eliminated in the closing stages of the game. Nowitzki missed two potentially game deciding jump shots, and the Mavericks lost, 115–113, at home. In Game 5, the demoralised Mavericks were no match for the spirited Kings, lost, 114–101, and were eliminated again. Among others, nba.com remarked that the Kings defended better than the Mavericks: in those five games, the statisticians counted 115 Sacramento layups against the Mavericks, meaning the Kings averaged 23 uncontested baskets (i.e., 46 easy points) per game. However, Nowitzki received a consolation award: the Gazzetta dello Sport voted him as [...] "European Basketballer of the Year", his 104 votes lifting him over second-placed Dejan Bodiroga (54) and Stojakovic (50).|$|E

[...] "I also told [...] Richardson that if by Godot I had meant God I would [...] said God, and not Godot. This seemed to disappoint him greatly." [...] That said, Beckett did once concede, [...] "It would be fatuous of me to pretend that I am not aware of the meanings attached to the word 'Godot', and the opinion of many that it means 'God'. But you must remember – I wrote the play in French, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> have that meaning in my mind, it was somewhere in my unconscious and I was not overtly aware of it." [...] (Note: the French word for 'God' is 'Dieu'.) However, [...] "Beckett has often stressed the strong unconscious impulses that partly control his writing; he has even spoken of being 'in a trance' when he writes." ...|$|E
