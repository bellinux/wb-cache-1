This approach does not exclude efforts to make information findable by applying principles and tools of information architecture. Information architecture, information overload, information <b>literacy</b> <b>and</b> digital <b>literacy</b> are defined <b>and</b> characterized, not forgetting about the differences and commonalities between them.

5|$|The book {{is divided}} into two parts. The first part, Epiphany, {{consists}} of eight chapters and focuses on the roots, development, and impact of the Scottish Enlightenment on Scotland and Great Britain. The roots come from an appreciation for democracy <b>and</b> <b>literacy</b> that developed from the Scottish Reformation, when John Knox brought Calvinist Presbyterianism to Scotland. He preached that God ordained power into the people and that it was for the people to administer and enforce God's laws, not the monarchy. For common people to understand God's laws they {{had to be able to}} read the Bible, so schools were built in every parish <b>and</b> <b>literacy</b> rates grew rapidly, creating a Scottish-oriented market for books and writers.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} prereading <b>and</b> early <b>literacy</b> {{in children with}} hearing impairments. There are two parts, firstly a theortical part and secondly a practical part. The theoretical part provides definitions of <b>literacy</b> <b>and</b> looks at different approaches by various authors. This generally focuses on reading <b>literacy,</b> prereading <b>and</b> early <b>literacy,</b> <b>and</b> issues of children's reading. Next are outlined factors affecting prereading <b>and</b> early <b>literacy,</b> <b>and</b> early reading skills in children with hearing disabilities. The following chapter examines <b>literacy</b> <b>and</b> how {{it relates to the}} Curriculum Framework for Preschool Education. The Final section of the theoretical part is devoted to testing prereading <b>and</b> early <b>literacy</b> in both the Czech Republic and the international environment, not only for pupils with hearing disabilities, but also hearing pupils. The practical part is devoted to investigating research into prereading <b>and</b> the early <b>literacy</b> of children with hearing impairment in nursery schools for the deaf in the Czech Republic; focusing on their final year before entering elementary school.

40|$|There is a {{perceptible}} {{need for}} overviews that broadly address media <b>literacy,</b> information <b>literacy</b> <b>and</b> related <b>literacies</b> {{for the last}} half decade, which was characterised {{by the emergence of}} several novel approaches and new concepts that answer the challenges caused by the pervasive presence and profound effect of information technology, especially social media. Therefore, this paper, which is a non-exhaustive (selective) review of the developments in the field, covers the period 2012 and 2016. The topics investigated include media <b>literacy,</b> information <b>literacy</b> <b>and</b> several other <b>literacies</b> in general, as well as social media <b>literacy,</b> news <b>literacy</b> <b>and</b> issues, related to prosumerism, in particular.
