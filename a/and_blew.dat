5|$|In Guadeloupe, {{damage from}} the storm was limited; potent gusts uprooted {{numerous}} trees <b>and</b> <b>blew</b> debris onto streets throughout Basse-Terre. One road was blocked off to traffic during its passage as a precautionary measure, but was reopened soon thereafter. Gale-force winds downed some electricity lines in Saint Kitts and Nevis, causing two island-wide outages. The storm enhanced moisture to produce intermittent torrents over the Virgin Islands, with localized totals {{of no more than}} 1inch (25mm). Winds in the area were also limited; the highest gust was experienced on Buck Island, measuring 52mph (83km/h).|$|E
5|$|Lajjun was {{allotted to}} the Arab {{state in the}} 1947 United Nations Partition Plan. The village was defended by the Arab Liberation Army (ALA). It was first {{assaulted}} by the Haganah on April 13, during the battle around kibbutz Mishmar HaEmek. ALA commander Fawzi al-Qawuqji claimed Jewish forces ("Haganah") had attempted to reach the crossroads at Lajjun in an outflanking operation, but the attack failed. The New York Times reported that twelve Arabs were killed and fifteen wounded during that Haganah offensive. Palmach units of the Haganah raided <b>and</b> <b>blew</b> up much of Lajjun {{on the night of}} April 15–16.|$|E

5|$|On August 12, 1985, Japan Airlines Flight 123, a Boeing 747-146SR, {{suffered}} a rupture {{of the pressure}} bulkhead in its tail section, caused by undetected damage during a faulty repair to the rear bulkhead after a tailstrike seven years earlier. Pressurized air subsequently rushed out of the bulkhead <b>and</b> <b>blew</b> off the plane's vertical stabilizer, also severing all four of its hydraulic control systems. The pilots were {{able to keep the}} plane airborne for 32 minutes using differential engine power, but without any hydraulics or the stabilizing force of the vertical stabilizer, the plane eventually crashed in mountainous terrain. There were only 4 survivors among the 524 on board. This accident is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 1961, Grissom was {{pilot of}} the second Project Mercury flight, Mercury-Redstone 4, which he named Liberty Bell 7. This was a sub-orbital flight that lasted 15 minutes and 37 seconds. After splashdown, {{emergency}} explosive bolts unexpectedly fired <b>and</b> <b>blew</b> the hatch off, causing water to flood into the spacecraft. Quickly exiting through the open hatch and into the ocean, Grissom nearly drowned as water began filling his spacesuit. A recovery helicopter tried to lift and retrieve the spacecraft, but the flooding spacecraft became too heavy, and it was ultimately cut loose before sinking.|$|E

50|$|A Blowing snow {{advisory}} {{was issued}} by the National Weather Service of the United States when wind driven snow reduces surface visibility and possibly hampers traveling. Blowing snow may be falling snow, or snow that has already accumulated but is picked up <b>and</b> <b>blown</b> by strong winds. This advisory was discontinued beginning with the 2008-09 winter storm season, replaced by the Winter Weather Advisory for Snow <b>and</b> <b>Blowing</b> Snow. However, if the storm is judged to be dangerous by local forecasters, a Winter Storm Warning for heavy snow <b>and</b> <b>blowing</b> snow may be issued.|$|R
5|$|After his {{retreat from}} Mani {{due to the}} defeats at Vergas and Diros Pasha renewed his {{offensive}} in August. Ibrahim's army was led by a Laconian from Bardounia named Bosinas who had assistance from the Egyptian fleet. On August 27, he reached Kariopoli {{in an attempt to}} take a safe path through the mountains. Before he reached the town of Polytsaravos, his army of 8,000 Egyptians was delayed by Theodoros Stathakos and his family of thirteen men who refused to let the invaders past their tower. Bosinas tried to negotiate with Stathakos. Stathakos, feigning surrender, told Bosinas to come and take his family's guns. As Bosinas came to retrieve the guns, the Stathakos family killed him. In retaliation, the Egyptians used their two cannons <b>and</b> <b>blew</b> up the tower.|$|E
5|$|Along the {{northern}} coastline of Venezuela, the hurricane produced heavy precipitation and a storm surge of about 13feet (4m), which damaged 60homes. Sustained winds on Isla Margarita peaked at 26mph (42km/h), {{and the most}} affected states were Falcón, Vargas, Aragua, Carabobo, and Anzoátegui. Rough waves capsized 10boats and closed several beaches, and one person drowned due to the surf. Further inland, two people drowned when a river overflowed its banks, and near Caracas a man died after strong winds toppled a wall. The combination of rainfall and winds destroyed 21houses <b>and</b> <b>blew</b> off the roof of several others, affecting 1,376people, of whom 80 were left homeless. Power outages and lack of water were reported. In the country, the hurricane caused 127injuries, and a death toll reported between three and five. An initial news story reported 28people missing offshore on threeboats.|$|E
5|$|At 07:50, Cota led {{the charge}} off of Dog Green, between WN-68 and WN-70, by forcing gaps in the wire with a Bangalore torpedo and wire cutters. Twenty minutes later, the 5th Rangers joined the advance, <b>and</b> <b>blew</b> more openings. The command party {{established}} themselves {{at the top of}} the bluff, and elements of G/116 and H/116 joined them, having earlier moved laterally along the beach, and now the narrow front had widened to the east. Before 09:00, small parties from F/116 and B/116 reached the crests just east of Dog White. The right flank of this penetration was covered by the survivors of the 2nd Rangers’ A and B companies, who had independently fought their way to the top between 08:00 and 08:30. They took WN-70 (already heavily damaged by naval shells), and joined the 5th Rangers for the move inland. By 09:00 more than 600 American troops, in groups ranging from company sized to just a few men, had reached the top of the bluff opposite Dog White and were advancing inland.|$|E

5|$|Nevada {{became a}} prime target for Japanese Val dive bombers {{during the second}} wave. Japanese pilots {{intended}} to sink her in the channel ostensibly to block the harbor. Tactically target selection was wrong as 14–18 dive bombers attacking her wouldn't be able to sink a battleship with 250kg bombs and the channel's width of 1200 feet made the idea of bottling up the harbor impossible. As she steamed past Ten-Ten Dock at about 09:50, Nevada was struck by five bombs. One exploded over the crew's galley at Frame 80. Another struck the port director platform and exploded {{at the base of}} the stack on the upper deck. Yet another hit near No. 1 turret inboard from the port waterway <b>and</b> <b>blew</b> large holes in the upper and main decks. Two struck the forecastle near Frame 15; one passed out through the side of the second deck before exploding, but the other exploded within the ship near the gasoline tank; leakage and vapors from this tank caused intense fires around the ship.|$|E
5|$|On September17, a {{hurricane}} {{was observed in}} the mid-Atlantic by the bark Phantom. Later that day, the Phantom sank, though all of the crew survived. They described {{the system as a}} 'perfect hurricane' with a lull around midnight on September17 before the wind changed direction <b>and</b> <b>blew</b> with even greater force than before. The hurricane continued travelling on a northwest track and between September22 and the night of September23 it was encountered by the Hudson, the City of Washington and the bark Lanark. The system weakened to a tropical storm early on September24 and dissipated later that day about 610mi (980km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Until reanalysis, this storm was considered two separate systems, including in the 1995 study by Partagas and Diaz. However, they stated that further information could indicate a single storm.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Squadron, {{commanded}} by Major Charles Dick, were also sent forward {{to support the}} 2nd Squadron's attempt to break through to the post. Advancing along the ridge from No.2 Post, they reached {{a position on the}} open plateau to the north of No.3 Post, but neither of the relieving squadrons could break through the Turkish lines, and were confronted by heavy Turkish fire from the surrounding higher ground. They were blocked by the sheer number of Turkish troops. Around noon the Turks undermined <b>and</b> <b>blew</b> up part of the trench at No.3 Post, which they then occupied. Turkish attacks continued all day, and they brought into action a mountain artillery gun from a nearby position. It was now estimated that around 3,000 Turkish troops were involved in the assault on No.3 Post.|$|E

5|$|The {{continuous}} development of Johor Bahru was, however, halted when the Japanese under General Tomoyuki Yamashita invaded the town on 31 January 1942. As the Japanese had reached northwest Johor by 15 January, they easily captured major towns of Johor such of Batu Pahat, Yong Peng, Kluang and Ayer Hitam. The British and other Allied forces {{were forced to}} retreat towards Johor Bahru; however, following a further series of bombings by the Japanese on 29 January, the British retreated to Singapore <b>and</b> <b>blew</b> up the causeway the following day as a final attempt to stop the Japanese advancement in British Malaya. The Japanese then used the Sultan's residence of Bukit Serene Palace located in the town as their main temporary base for their future initial plans to conquest Singapore while waiting to reconnect the causeway. The Japanese chose the palace as their main base because they already knew the British would not dare to attack it as this would harm their close relationship with Johor.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before making}} landfall, the {{hurricane}} caused extensive damage in Louisiana, {{due in part}} to the hurricane's slow speed and close proximity to the state coast. Winds as high as 60mph (100km/h) brushed the coastline, causing extensive damage. Storm surge pushed coastal waters to near-record heights, inundating low-lying areas. Near Morgan City, Louisiana, 19people went missing after going on a fishing trip; they were later found marooned at Atchafalaya Basin. The schooner J.W. Clise was abandoned during the storm 135mi (215km) south of the Mississippi River Delta, though its crew was also later rescued. Storm surge peaked at 6.4ft (1.95m) above-average in western portions of Lake Pontchartrain. A bridge crossing Thunder Bayou, which extended west of the lake, was washed out by the waves. Similarly, a station at Calcasieu Pass reported a storm surge 4.8ft (1.46m) high. Conservation officials feared the disturbance would disrupt the seafood and muskrat production. After the storm, it was estimated 75,000muskrats were killed by the storm's effects. Offshore, Grand Isle was inundated by the strong waves. Around Houma, sugar cane crops were damaged. The hurricane was the strongest to impact Cameron since the tenth hurricane of the 1886 Atlantic hurricane season; strong gusts peaked at 70mph (115km/h), disrupting communication lines, thus isolating the city from other locations in the state. The high tides inundated town streets under 2ft (0.6m). Other areas extending from western Louisiana to Mobile, Alabama reported communication disruptions. In New Orleans, strong winds uprooted signboards <b>and</b> <b>blew</b> debris across the city streets. Several houses in Shell Beach and Delacroix Island were leveled by strong winds.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Edouard passed about 95miles (150km/h) {{southeast}} of Nantucket while moving at only 12mph (19km/h), much slower than previous New England hurricanes. This resulted in {{several hours of}} strong waves, winds, and rain. The hurricane produced wave heights of up to 31feet (9.4m), which washed twelve boats ashore and damaged numerous others. The strong waves and a storm surge of up to 2.1feet (.6m) in Nantucket flooded a few coastal roads. Edouard also produced tropical storm force winds across much of Massachusetts, {{as well as one}} hurricane-force gust on Nantucket. In addition, there were unofficial reports of stronger gusts, including 77mph (124km/h) on Cape Cod, 80mph (129km/h) on Martha's Vineyard, and 90mph (145km/h) on Nantucket. The strong winds caused power outages to 2/3 of Nantucket, all of Martha's Vineyard for six hours, and most of Cape Cod for several hours. Power outages, effecting 35,000 to 40,000 were reported throughout Massachusetts, though far from the power outages caused by Hurricane Bob five years prior. The winds also downed numerous trees, <b>and</b> <b>blew</b> off the roof of the fire station in Hyannis. Rainfall was moderate from the slow-moving hurricane, peaking at 6.37inches (162mm) in West Dennis with many other locations reporting over 3inches (76mm). The rainfall produced minor street flooding. Damage on Cape Cod totaled to $3.5million (1996USD, $4.6million 2007USD).|$|E
