2500|$|According to Father Christopher Lawrence Zugger, [...] "The Bolsheviks {{had already}} orchestrated several 'show trials.' The Cheka had staged the 'Trial of the St. Petersburg Combat Organization'; its successor, the new GPU, the 'Trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries.' In {{these and other}} such farces, {{defendants}} were inevitably sentenced to death or to long prison terms in the north. The Cieplak show trial {{is a prime example}} of Bolshevik revolutionary justice at this time. Normal judicial procedures did not restrict revolutionary tribunals at all; in fact, the prosecutor N.V. Krylenko, stated that the courts could trample upon the rights of classes other than the proletariat. Appeals from the courts went not to a higher court, but to political committees. Western observers found the setting -- the grand ballroom of a former Noblemen's Club, with painted cherubs on the ceiling -- singularly inappropriate for such a solemn event. Neither judges nor prosecutors were required to have <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>background,</b> only a proper 'revolutionary' one. That the prominent 'No Smoking' signs were ignored by the judges themselves did not bode well for legalities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the early}} members of the {{community}} to gain prominence were sages and religious scholars like Agatthiar, Tholkappiyar, Parimelazhagar and Naccinarkiniyar. Prior to the 19th century, almost all prominent members of this community hailed from religious or literary spheres. Tyagaraja, Syama Sastri and Muthuswamy Dīkshitar, who constitute the [...] "Trinity of Carnatic music" [...] were probably the first verified historical personages from the community, as the accounts or biographies of [...] those who lived earlier appear semi-legendary in character. During the British Raj, Iyers and Iyengars dominated the services by their predominance in the legal and administrative professions. Most of the Dewans [...] of the princely state of Travancore during the 19th century were Tamil Brahmins (Iyers and Iyengars). Some of the prominent individuals of the period as Seshayya Sastri, Sir T. Muthuswamy Iyer, Sir P. S. Sivaswami Iyer, Shungrasoobyer, Sir K. Seshadri Iyer, Sir S. Subramania Iyer and C. P. Ramaswamy Ayyar all had <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>background.</b> At the same time, they were also intimately associated with the Indian National Congress and the Indian independence movement.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the interaction between}} the concepts of ”justice” (ma&# 8219;at) and ”law” (hpw) in ancient Egypt. Ma&# 8219;at, one of the earliest abstract terms in human speech, was a central principle and, although no codex of Egyptian law has been found, there is abundant evidence of written law, designed to realise ma&# 8219;at on earth. The king, as the highest legal authority, was the nexus between ma&# 8219;at and the law. Egyptologists have few sources of knowledge about law and justice in ancient Egypt because the ancient Egyptians used commonplace language in legal documents and they only had a few imprecise technical terms relating to law. For Egyptology to advance, therefore, we need to reappraise its sources.
