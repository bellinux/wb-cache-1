40|$|ABSTRACT A strain (F) {{in which}} 16 -week body weight had been {{increased}} 2. 22 and 2. 00 kg in males and females, respectively, after 14 generations of selection for increased 16 -week body weight was compared with its corresponding randombred control (RBC 2) for {{weight of the}} ab-dominal fat pad at 20 weeks of age. At 20 weeks of age, body weight of the F strain was 2. 58 and 2. 23 kg greater for males and females, respectively, {{than that of the}} RBC 2 strain. The comparison was made on offspring in three weekly hatches. Because different buildings were used for the hatches, the effects of hatches and buildings were confounded. The increase in body weight of the F strain was associated with an increase {{in the size of the}} <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> (both actual weight and weight expressed as percent of live body weight). The <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> was larger in females than in males. Hatch (building) effects and the interaction of strain and hatch were significant sources of variation in <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> weight. The linear regression coefficients of <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> weight on body weight differed be-tween sexes and strains.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{combined}} {{effects of}} growth pattern (GP) and dietary CP level during rearing (2 to 22 wk of age) on body composition and performance were investigated in broiler breeder females from 0 to 40 wk of age. One-day-old pullets (n = 768) were randomly allotted to 48 pens according to 2 growth patterns (standard = SGP and high = HGP) and fed using 1 of 3 dietary CP levels (high = CPh, medium = CPm, and low = CPl). From 19 to 22 wk of age, feeding level was gradually adjusted {{to obtain a}} similar target BW for all birds, and then until 40 wk of age, all birds received similar amounts of a standard breeder diet. During the rearing period, the HGP pullets were fed a higher feed intake level (6. 5 %) than SGP pullets. To meet BW targets at 22 wk of age, feed intake from d 14 onward had to be increased for the CPm (4. 6 %) and CPl (10. 0 %) treatments. Breast muscle percentages of HGP and SGP pullets were similar at any age, although <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> at 20 wk was 0. 18 % higher for HGP pullets. Pullets fed the CPl diet had a lower breast muscle percentage compared with pullets fed the CPm and CPh diets (0. 46 and 0. 85 % at wk 10, 0. 81 and 1. 45 % at wk 20, respectively). <b>Abdominal</b> fat <b>pads</b> in CPl pullets were 0. 18 and 0. 22 % (wk 10), and 0. 24 and 0. 42 % (wk 20) higher compared with CPm and CPh pullets, respectively. At 40 wk of age, no effects on breast muscle and <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> were found among all treatments. Egg production, sexual maturation, and egg weight were not affected by GP and CP levels during rearing. It was concluded that a low CP diet during rearing decreased breast muscle and increased <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad,</b> whereas a high GP only increased <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad,</b> {{at the end of}} the rearing period. Decreasing dietary CP level seems to be more effective in increasing <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> than increasing GP...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Cellularity of the <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> and {{lipogenesis}} in {{the liver}} were studied in 9 -week-old chickens after eight generations of selection for increased body weight gain (line W), increased food consumption (Line F), decreased food conversion ratio (line E), or at random (line C). The average volume of the adipose cells in the <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> was greatest in the birds of line F and smallest in birds of line E. Differences {{in the number of}} adipose cells in this fat depot in birds from all the lines can be largely attributed to differences in growth rate. Lipogenesis, as measured by in vitro incorporation of 14 C-ghicose into lipid and the activity of NADP-malate dehydrogenase, was highest in birds from line F and lowest in birds from line E. These differences in lipogenesis among groups could not be attributed to differences in food consumption or growth rate. The biochemical basis for differences in lipogenesis among lines is not clear at this stage. (Key words: adipose cells, malic enzyme, lipid synthesis, <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad,</b> chickens...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{total of}} five {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the effects of early feed restriction on organ weights, fat deposition, and carcass composition in broilers. In Experiments 1 and 2, broiler chicks were reared in litter pens for 49 days, whereas Experiments 3, 4, and 5 were conducted in battery cages for 28 days. Feed restriction in all experiments was accomplished by providing male broiler chicks 40 kcal per bird per day for 7 (Experiments 1 and 2) or 6 (Experiments 3, 4, and 5) days, starting at 4 days of age. Feed restriction of broiler pullets in Experiment 1 was imposed from 4 to 9 days of age. Furthermore, the starter and grower diets in Experiment 2 contained either 1 or 4 % added fat and the starter diets in Experiments 3, 4, and 5 contained either 21 or 26 % protein. No significant differences were observed for <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> and gizzard weights, liver and carcass fat, or carcass protein between early restricted birds and ad libitum controls at 49 days of age in Experiments 1 and 2. Furthermore, {{with the exception of}} Experiment 4, no differences in <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> weights were observed among the different feeding regimens. Significant increases in <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> weights, percentage liver, and percentage carcass fat were noted for females at 49 days of age when compared with male broilers. Carcass fat was significantly higher and carcass protein was significantly lower in broilers fed commercial versus reduced fat diets. Broilers fed a 21 % protein diet had significantly heavier <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> weights at 28 days of age than birds fed a 26 % protein diet. No significant interactions were observed between the various treatments for the different variables measured. Results from the present studies indicate that early feed restriction minimally affects organ weights, fat deposition, and carcass composition of broiler chickens later in life.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of dietary fat on serum leptin and T 3 concentrations and their interactions. Methods: 18 male mice were maintained on a purified laboratory diet. Mice were then separated into two groups: a control group that received a standard laboratory diet and a high fat group that received a 1 % cholesterol-enriched diet supplemented with 0. 2 % cholic acid and 2. 5 % olive oil as dietary fat for three weeks. Blood samples then were collected. Serum leptin and thyroid hormones quantification were performed by ELISA and RIA methods, respectively. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentration were measured by standard chemical methods. Mice <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pads</b> were also weighed. Results: Serum cholesterol, triglyceride and <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pads</b> showed significant increase in the high fat group (108 %, 59 % and 107 % respectively) (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Background: It is well {{established}} now that fat deposition is governed by the genetic, nutritional and management practices. However, most influenced agent in this respect is the nutritional factors mainly phase feeding. Objectives: This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of phase feeding diets (starter, grower and finisher) on broiler performance, serum-carcass cholesterol and fatty acids profile. Material and Methods: A number of 90 chicks (Ross 308) from the healthy and uniform chicks were selected and (Ross 308) reared for six weeks in deep litter open house and assigned randomly to the three dietary treatments each replicated three times (nine experimental pens, {{at the rate of}} ten chicks per pen).

40|$|ABSTRACT Cellular {{growth of}} the <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pads</b> from Tegel TM 70 white broiler {{chickens}} was characterized by both hyperplasia and hypertrophy of adipose cells until the chickens were approximately 14 weeks old, after which hypertrophy of existing adipose cells was solely responsible for increases in the mass of these fat deposits. The percent body fat was linearly and positively correlated {{with the weight of}} abdominal fat. However, at a constant percent body fat, male birds had a larger deposit of fat in the abdominal region than did females. Thus, a different relationship to predict body fat would be required for each sex. In mature birds the mass of an adipose tissue deposit is generally reflected in the size of adipose cells rather than the number of cells in an adipose organ.

40|$|Different {{combinations}} of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were fed to broilers {{to establish their}} effect on the fatty acid composition of the broiler carcass and the <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad.</b> Six {{combinations of}} Canola acid oil (CAO, high levels of C 18 : 3 n- 3 and monounsaturated fatty acids) and Famarol acid oil (FAO, high levels of C 18 : 2 n- 6 and saturated fatty acids) {{were included in the}} broiler diets from one day of age to six weeks of age, viz. 100 % FAO, 80 % FAO- 20 % CAO, 60 % FAO- 40 % CAO, 40 % FAO- 60 % CAO, 20 % FAO- 80 % CAO, 100 % CAO. There were no statistically significant differences between dietary groups in weight gain (1. 71 ± 0. 059 kg) or feed conversion ratios (1. 97 ± 0. 051 g feed/g gain). No significant differences between treatments were found in the moisture (66. 20 ± 0. 112 %), protein (17. 63 ± 0. 484 %), lipid (15. 92 ± 1. 507 %) and ash (0. 95 ± 0. 115 %) concentration of the carcasses, nor in the moisture (28. 77 ± 0. 112 %), protein (3. 03 ± 0. 484 %), lipid (63. 32 ± 9. 789 %) and ash (0. 45 ± 0. 135 %) concentrations of the <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pads.</b> With the increase in dietary CAO levels, the mean percentages of C 18 : 2 n- 6 and C 20 : 4 n- 6 in the carcasses decreased respectively with 1. 78 % units from 20. 88 % and 0. 35 % units from 1. 05 %, whilst C 18 : 3 n- 3 and longer chain n- 3 fatty acids such as C 20 : 5 n- 3 and C 22 : 6 n- 3 increased respectively with 2. 25 % units from 1 %, 0. 1 % units from 0. 1 % and 0. 67 % units from 0. 2 %. The same tendency was seen in the <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pads</b> where C 18 : 2 n- 6 and C 20 : 4 n- 6 decreased respectively with 1. 55 % units from 20. 75 % and 0. 98 % units from 1. 2 % with an increase in dietary CAO, whilst C 18 : 3 n- 3, C 20 : 5 n- 3 and C 22 : 6 n- 3 increased respectively with 2. 13 % units from 1. 15 %, 0. 45 % units from 0. 03 % and 0. 95 % units from 0. 05 %. The n- 3 /n- 6 ratio in the carcasses and <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pads</b> increased respectively with 0. 16 % units from 0. 06 % and 0. 19 % units from 0. 06 % with an increase in dietary CAO. These results clearly indicate that dietary CAO enriched with α-linolenic acid lowered the saturated fatty acid concentrations in broiler carcasses and <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pads</b> with 4. 88 % units and 10. 63 % units respectively, and increased the monounsaturated fatty acid concentrations with 3. 87 % units and 7. 25 % units, respectively and polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations with 1. 02 % units and 2. 38 % units, respectively. The results of this experiment showed that substitution of Famarol oil with Canola oil in broiler diets can increase the ratio of n- 6 to n- 3 fatty acids in broiler carcasses and <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pads</b> to 5 : 1, a ratio more suitable for human health. Increasing the level of n- 3 fatty acids in the diets was also effective in reducing the level of saturated fatty acids in the carcasses and <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pads</b> of broiler chickens resulting in "healthier" chickens. © South African Society for Animal Science.

40|$|This {{research}} project consisted of five experiments. The main {{objective of this}} study was to determine the effects of restricted feeding and season on growth, carcass characteristics, meat chemical composition, reproduction and egg laying performance of Koekoek chickens. Feed restriction lowered the body weight, weight gain, feed intake and improved the feed conversion efficiency during the rearing phase. During the laying phase, chickens that were in the RA treatment had higher body weights, weight gains and lower FCR. Chickens that were reared in summer had a higher body weight, weight gain and FCR, while total feed intake and mortality rates were high in winter. Feed restriction reduced the slaughter weight, defeathered weight, dressed weight, skin weight, breast muscle weight, shank width, chest width and heart girth during the rearing phase. The intestine, liver and <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> weights were higher in chickens that were fed ad libitum. Chickens that were reared in summer had higher shank width, slaughter weight, defeathered weight, chest width, heart girth, breast muscle weight, skin weight, <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> weight, intestine weight, liver weight and the relative skin percentage at the age of 18 weeks. During the laying phase, <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> weight, <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> percentage, intestine percentage, liver weight, gizzard weight and gizzard percentage were higher in the ad libitum fed chickens. Unrestricted feeding during the rearing phase increased the development of combs, wattles, pubic bones, ovaries and oviducts more than restricted feeding while at the age of 32 weeks, enhanced growth of the reproductive organs was seen in chickens that were fed ad libitum only during the laying phase (RA). The cold winter conditions hindered the growth of the combs, wattles, pubic bones, oviducts and ovaries. Restricted feeding during the laying phase reduced the laying percentage, egg weights and improved the hatching percentage. Ad libitum feeding during the rearing phase resulted in the attainment of puberty at an earlier age in chickens. Chickens that were produced in summer reached puberty first as well as 20 %, 50 % and 80 % egg production, and had a higher average laying percentage and egg weights.

40|$|Background: Fine-needle {{aspiration}} biopsy (FNA) of the <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> is a {{minimally invasive}} procedure to demonstrate tissue deposits of amyloid. However, protocols to evaluate amyloid in fat pad aspirates are not standardized, especially for detecting scant amyloid in early disease. Materials and Methods: We studied <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> aspirates from 33 randomly selected patients in whom subsequent tissue biopsy, autopsy, and/or medical history for confirmation of amyloidosis (AL) were also available. All these cases were suspected to have early AL, but had negative results on <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> aspirates evaluated by polarizing microscopy of Congo Red stained sections (CRPM). The results with CRPM between four reviewers were compared in 12 cases for studying inter observer reproducibility. 24 cases were also evaluated by ultrastructural study with electron microscopy (EM). Results: Nine of thirty-three (27 %) cases reported negative by polarizing microscopy had amyloidosis. Reanalysis of 12 mixed positive-negative cases, showed considerable inter-observer variability with frequent lack of agreement between four observers by CRPM alone (Cohen’s Kappa index of 0. 1, 95 % CI - 0. 1 to 0. 36). EM showed amyloid in the walls of small blood vessels in fibroadipose tissue in four out of nine cases (44 %) with amyloidosis. Conclusion: In addition to poor inter-observer reproducibility, CRPM alone in cases with scant amyloid led to frequent false negative results (9 out of 9, 100 %). For improved detection of AL, routine ultrastructural evaluation with EM of fat pad aspirates by evaluating at least 15 small {{blood vessels in the}} aspirated fibroadipose tissue is recommended. Given the high false negative rate for CRPM alone in early disease, routine reflex evaluation with EM is highly recommended to avert the invasive option of biopsying various organs in cases with high clinical suspicion for AL...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} dietary energy to protein balance, and early life caloric {{restriction}} on <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> {{development in the}} male broiler chicken was studied.

40|$|Background: Alkaptonuria (AKU) is an {{inborn error}} of {{catabolism}} {{due to a}} deficient activity of homogentisate 1, 2 -dioxygenase. Patients suffer from a severe arthropathy, cardiovascular and kidney disease but other organs are affected, too. We found secondary amyloidosis as a life-threatening complication in AKU, thus opening new perspectives for its treatment. We proved that methotrexate and anti-oxidants have an excellent efficacy to inhibit the production of amyloid in AKU model chondrocytes. Owing to the progressive and intractable condition, it seems important to detect amyloid deposits at an early phase in AKU and the choice of specimens for a correct diagnosis is crucial. Methods: Ten AKU subjects were examined for amyloidosis; <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> aspirates, labial salivary gland, cartilage and synovia specimens were analysed by CR, Th-T, IF, TEM. Results: Amyloid was detected in only one <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> specimen.

In this experiment, 450 one day old Cobb 500 broiler chicks (mixed-sex) were used in a completely randomized design with 3 × 2 factorial arrangement. There were three levels of Fermacto (0, 0. 15 and 0. 3 % for 42 days) and two levels of diet dilution using rice hulls (0 and 40 % at 10 - 21 days of age). The treatments consisted of 3 replicates with 25 chicks per each. Administration of Fermacto did not influence feed intake or feed conversion ratio, but the daily weight gain improved.

A corn- soybean meal based diet containing levels of TRP (0. 00, 0. 25, 0. 50 and 0. 75 %) was used. In a completely randomized design with four treatments of five replicates each, and 10 chickens per replicate, 200, Ross male broiler chickens from 0 - 49 days were studied.

40|$|Vorozole, a {{selective}} aromatase inhibitor, was administered in ovo {{to test the}} specific embryonic role of estrogen in conferring the sex distinction in GH release and body phenotype in broilers. On Day 6 of incubation, eggs were injected with saline or with different concentrations of vorozole. Postnatal blood samples were analyzed for T- 3, T- 4, GH, estradiol (E- 2), and testosterone (T). At the age of 4 wk, control and vorozole-treated birds were cannulated, and serial blood samples were withdrawn every 10 min for 5 hr, wherein GH pulsatility characteristics were determined using deconvolution analysis. The proportional <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> weight was reduced significantly in the treated groups, especially in female birds. The vorozole treatment increased plasma T- 3, E- 2, T, and GH concentrations, and decreased T- 4. The frequency of the GH pulses was lower and the interval between the bursts (min) was higher in the vorozole-treated group, as were the mass secreted per burst (ng/ml), the amplitude (ng/ml/min) and the production rate (ng/ml/ 5 hr). In conclusion, early in ovo treatment with a potent aromatase inhibitor is able to increase the mean serum T- 3 and GH concentration and masculinize the GH pulse pattern, resulting in an economically favorable decrease in <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> content in male and female broilers at slaughter age.

40|$|The Juice Wastes Mixture (JWM) is a {{combination}} of waste from carrot and some fruits (apple, mango, avocado, orange, melon and tree tomato) in the same proportion after their juices were squeezed for fresh drink. The JWM could be as an alternative potential feed for replacing corn in the broiler diet. The problem of JWM as broiler feed is the high in crude fiber and low in metabolic energy contents. After processing the JWM by soaking in 20 % concentration of rice hull ash filtrate for 72 hr (IJWM), its crude fiber decreased, while its metabolizable energy increased. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the utilization of IJWM in broiler diets. The experiment was performed in a completely randomized design with different levels of IJWM (0, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 %) for replacing corn in the broiler diets. The variables measured were feed consumption, average daily gain, feed conversion, live body weight, <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> percentage, carcass percentage, liver percentage and pancreas percentage. Every treatment was repeated 4 times. The results showed that the IJWM influenced the feed consumption, average daily gain, live body weight, feed conversion and <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> very significantly (P< 0. 01). Meanwhile, liver percentage and pancreas percentage were not affected by the IJWM. In conclusion, the IJWM could be included up to 40 % to effectively replace 80 % corn in the broiler diets...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Key words: broiler breeder, feeding strategies, body composition, reproduction, {{behavior}} Nowadays, welfare {{issues in}} broiler breeders associated with nutrition and reproductive characteristics, {{are becoming increasingly}} challenging. Due to genetic selection on broilers, body composition of breeders has changed dramatically during the last 50 years to less fat and more breast muscle. It is postulated that {{a certain amount of}} body fat in broiler breeders at the onset of lay is necessary for maximum performance and offspring quality. Body composition of breeders can be influenced by different feed allowances during rearing and lay, as well as by changes in nutrient composition of the diet. However, {{little is known about the}} effects of body composition on reproduction of broiler breeders. In this thesis, we investigated the effects of different feeding strategies during the rearing period on body composition at the end of rearing. Moreover, the effects of differences in body composition at the end of rearing, and feeding strategies during lay were evaluated on breeder performance, incubation traits, offspring performance, behavior and feather cover. From this study, it can be concluded that feeding a low protein diet during rearing decreased breast muscle and increased <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad,</b> whereas providing an increased feeding schedule, which resulted in a high growth pattern, only increased <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad,</b> at the end of rearing. The higher <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> content resulted in an increased hatchability during the first phase of lay and a larger number of eggs during the second phase of lay. For maintaining growth pattern, broiler breeders had to provide a higher amount of feed with an increased energy to protein ratio compared to broiler breeders that were fed a diet with a standard energy to protein ratio. This resulted in an increased eating time and less stereotypic object pecking, which may indicate a reduced hunger and frustration. On the other hand, a low daily protein intake during the rearing and first phase of lay can lead to a poor feather cover. Feeding a high-energy diet during the second phase of lay resulted in increased hatchability, decreased embryonic mortality and more first grade chicks.  ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} feeding a beta agonist, cimaterol, on carcass yield and {{composition}} and adipose tissue development was studied in female broilers. Cimaterol was provided at. 25 ppm in the feed starting at 4 wk of age. Birds were sacrificed at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16 wk for determination of eviscerated carcass yield, carcass composition, and growth and cellularity of the abdominal, neck, back, and sartorial adipose depots. Carcass yield was significantly (P<. 01) greater in treated birds than in controls (70. 0 vs. 72. 8 %) at 10 wk of age. Moisture percentage and protein decreased (P<. 05) less rapidly in treated carcasses than in control carcasses with increasing age.

40|$|Abstract: The study {{determined}} {{the effects of}} garlic, ginger and their mixtures on the growth, serum lipids, haematological indices, carcass and organs of broilers. Garlic and ginger were each added to broiler diets at 1, 1. 5 and 2 %. Four mixtures of garlic and ginger were also formulated. Control diet did not contain any test ingredient. The results showed that garlic, ginger and mixtures contained 7. 41, 5. 85 and 6. 62 % crude protein respectively. Dietary treatment significantly influenced the final liveweights (FLW) of broiler chicks (P< 0. 001) and chickens (P< 0. 01). The mixtures of garlic and ginger significantly (P< 0. 001) improved FLW and weight gain th of the 28 day old chicks than those of control birds. Garlic at 1. 5 and 2 % ginger significantly (P< 0. 01) decreased the FLW of the chickens relative to the control. Dietary treatment significantly (P< 0. 001) affected the carcass parts and organs development of broiler chickens. However, dietary garlic, ginger and mixtures {{did not affect the}} red blood cells and haemoglobin concentration of the chickens. The mixtures of garlic and ginger exhibited better antilipidemic influence on the serum cholesterol, triacylglycerol and <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> of the chickens than sole garlic and ginger.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of insoluble granite-grit on growth performance and gut health status of broiler chicks. One hundred and sixty 14 -day-old broiler chicks were allocated to experimental groups control and grit feeding. Each group included 80 birds divided by four replicates, each consisting of 20 birds, 10 males and 10 females. Feed intake, body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, carcass weight, dressing percentage, gut length, <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad,</b> and liver, heart, and gizzard weights were determined. Starter diet included 230 g crude protein (CP) kg− 1 and 3. 15 Mcal metabolizable energy (ME) kg− 1 during the days 14 to 21; grower diet included 212 g CP kg− 1 and 3. 20 Mcal ME kg− 1; and finisher diet included 190 g CP kg− 1 and 3. 20 Mcal ME kg- 1. Control birds were fed broiler diets, while grit-fed birds were allowed to consume broiler diets, including 3 % insoluble granite-grit. Grit feeding improved the final body weight (2268 vs. 2336 g) with better feed efficiency (2. 03 vs. 1. 95) and less feed intake (3780 vs. 3764 g). Grit feeding increased gizzard weight (31. 63 vs. 48. 00 g) without affecting carcass weight (1643 vs. 1708 g), dressing percentage (73. 50 vs. 73. 60 %), liver weight (42. 69 vs. 40. 69 g), heart weight (12. 00 vs. 11. 63 g), <b>abdominal</b> fat <b>pad</b> (34. 50 vs. 35. 38 g), and gut length (229. 3 vs. 220. 7 cm) of broilers.
