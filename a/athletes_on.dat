5|$|After the 1988 season, the Brewers added Bates {{to their}} winter roster as the 1989 season approached. However, when 12-year Brewer second baseman Jim Gantner re-signed with the club, Bates was demoted to Denver, and the Journal-Sentinel {{predicted}} {{that he would}} remain there due to his limited defensive versatility. Bates began the season with the Zephyrs and in July {{was named to the}} Triple-A All-Star Game. On the MLB level, the Brewers suffered multiple injuries to starting players, having 9 <b>athletes</b> <b>on</b> the disabled list (DL) on August 22 and 14 total players on the DL up to that point. In a game against the New York Yankees on August 15, Gantner played at second base as the Brewers tried to hold on to a 1–0 lead. With Marcus Lawton on first base, Yankees batter Wayne Tolleson hit a ground ball to shortstop Bill Spiers for a potential double play. Lawton ran into Gantner, who had trouble fielding a low throw from Spiers; umpire Dave Phillips called both Lawton and Tolleson out due to Lawton's illegal roll-block, but Gantner tore the medial collateral ligament in his left knee and was placed on the DL. Bates was called up as his replacement.|$|E

5|$|Qualification for {{the race}} was {{restricted}} to three athletes per National Olympic Committee (NOC), an organisation representing a country at the Olympics, until eight NOCs had three qualified athletes. Once eight NOCs had qualified three athletes; a NOC was limited to two entries. A NOC with an athlete who won {{one of the five}} continental championships (Africa, Asia, Pan America, Europe and Oceania) were given one place in the event. Additionally, three places were available for the NOC of the medallists at the International Triathlon Union (ITU) World Qualification Event. Another 38 places were available to the NOCs with the highest ranked <b>athletes</b> <b>on</b> the ITU Olympic Qualification List on 31 May 2012. If an athlete had already qualified through another method the NOC did not receive another quota with it instead going to the next NOC on the ITU Olympic Qualification List. Five more entries into the event were given to one NOC per continental region. This was based on the ITU Olympic Qualification List with the highest ranked athlete from a non-qualified NOC in their continental region qualifying a place for their NOC in the event. One was given to the Great Britain NOC as the hosts but as they had already gained a place, the host place was given to the highest eligible athlete on the ITU Olympic Qualification List's NOC. The final two places for the event was given to two NOCs chosen by the Tripartite Commission.|$|E
