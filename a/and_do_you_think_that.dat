6000|$|... "Man, do {{you think}} I would have you perjure yourself, even if that would do me a service? <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> any man was ever served by a lie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God {{will have}} nought {{to say in}} the matter, my friend," [...] {{retorted}} Stoutenburg dryly, [...] "'tis only the Stadtholder who will have his say, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he is like to pardon...." ...|$|E
6000|$|LESLIE. I know, I know, dear heart! <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I, {{whom you}} have chosen, I whose {{whole life is}} in your love--do you think that I would press you now if there were not good cause? ...|$|E
60|$|SHE. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> for {{a moment}} he'd stand it, like that half-baked clergyman in the play? He'd just kill you.|$|R
6000|$|Bel. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it {{reasonable}} {{for me to}} stand defendant to all the impertinent questions, that the town can ask me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I trust so. I trust so, indeed. Eighty {{thousand}} pounds! <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I {{can raise}} such a sum as {{that at a}} week's warning?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll see you hanged first, Eggy my boy! Go I won't, until {{these ladies}} {{have had their}} hair dressed: didn't you {{yourself}} tell me that Miss Crump's {{was the most beautiful}} hair in Europe? <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I'll go away without seeing it? No, here I stay." ...|$|E
6000|$|I seized her {{reluctant}} hand--"Dear friend," [...] I cried, [...] "misguided victim, do you {{not intend}} to escape with me? Have you not risked all in facilitating my flight? <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> I will permit you to return, and suffer alone the effects of that miscreant's rage? Never!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Grizel garbed in wiles! Alack the day! She was {{shielding}} the man, and Gemmell {{could have}} driven her away roughly {{to get at}} him. But she was also standing over her own pride, lest anyone should see that it had fallen; <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> David would have made her budge an inch? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Rivers? That flimsy, feather-headed, empty-hearted--eyes-maker! That frivolous, ridiculous--Pah! <b>And</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that I {{was talking}} of her? Did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I {{was in love}} with her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is just it," [...] she returned. [...] "Nobody {{can imagine}} the first Christians, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we can imagine {{anything}} like them in our own day?" ...|$|R
60|$|Such {{a shabby}} dark room it was, {{but it was}} home, such a weary worn woman in the bed, but he was her son, {{and she had been}} {{wringing}} her hands because he was so long in coming, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he hurt her when he pressed his head on her poor breast, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> she grudged the heat his cold hands drew from her warm face? He squeezed her with a violence that put more heat into her blood than he took out of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{do you not}} see the {{converse}} implication? Do you not see that your hands would then be tied, {{that you would be}} wanting in honour if afterwards you refused him? <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I would consent to anything that could so tie your hands? Do you think I want to see you damned, Aline?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But Fanny, dear, I {{must speak}} as I find. You {{were talking about}} clouds just now, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> all {{this is not a}} cloud in my sky? Ludovic tells me that he is {{attached}} to Miss Robarts, and you tell me that she is attached to him; and I am called upon to decide between them. Her very act obliges me to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you take}} me for a pig like yourself?" [...] said Leonard angrily. [...] "Well, go your own way, foolish that you are, but beware of the beer and the spirits. Now you are {{beginning}} to know this language, and when you are drunk you talk, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there are no spies here? That girl, Saga, is great-niece to Nam, and you are besotted with her. Be careful lest you bring us all to death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she admitted. [...] "But we've been {{thirty years}} {{coming to the}} {{understanding}} that you all admire so much; <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{it was worth the}} time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do entirely as <b>you</b> <b>think</b> best, Cuthbert. Of course, {{beyond the}} fact that perhaps {{something}} wrong may have been done, I have not an idea what it can be, <b>and</b> I <b>do</b> not want to know, unless it must be told me. How long are you likely to be away <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are fit to travel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God for that, lad; it is {{more than}} I expected. This will be news indeed for the poor women. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he will be strong enough to keep his pledge?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{this was}} an {{exceptional}} case? The sign of a Philistine age is the cry of immorality against art, and this cry was raised by the Athenian people against every great poet and thinker of their day - AEschylus, Euripides, Socrates. It was the same with Florence in the thirteenth century. Good handicrafts are due to guilds, not to the people. The moment the guilds lost their power and the people rushed in, beauty and honesty of work died.|$|E
6000|$|... "What! {{would you}} have us remain together, hating each other, vilifying each other, calling each other base names as you just now called me? <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we could still be man and wife? No, Sir Henry. I have made one great mistake--committed one wretched, fatal error. I have so placed myself that I must hear myself so called and bear it quietly; but I will not {{continue}} to be so used. Do {{you think he would}} have called me so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was with}} you, {{hammering}} at the inner gate," [...] said Simon, [...] "and yet once when I {{thought that it}} was giving way I said in my heart: 'Good-by, Samkin! I shall never see you more.' This Baron has gall in his soul, even as I have myself, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I would give up my prisoners alive, if I were constrained so to do? No, no; had we won our way this day {{it would have been the}} death-stroke for them all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] cried Tommy, in agony, [...] "she's my sister, and we're orphans, <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I {{could have}} the heart to leave Elspeth behind?" [...] He took her stoutly by the hand.|$|R
6000|$|Don Jer. How! {{would you}} rob {{me of my}} child by a trick, a false pretence? <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> to get her fortune by the same means? Why, 'slife! you are as great a rogue as Isaac! ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. [Scornfully.] <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I'd let poor Harry {{be murdered}} so that I might {{be free to}} listen to your generous proposals? <b>You</b> must <b>think</b> I'm a fool if you expect me to risk my neck for that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{far short}} of that, I think, but I feel sure our men will do it. They know of the treachery of the Nana, they know of the {{massacre}} by the river, {{and they know that}} the women and children are prisoners in his hands, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> men who know these things can be beaten? The Sepoys met them in superior force and in a strong position at Futtehpore, and they drove them before them like chaff. They will have harder work next time, but I have no shadow of fear of the result." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I {{tell you}} what," [...] says Mr. Bucket, instantaneously {{altering}} his manner, coming close to him, and communicating an extraordinary fascination to the forefinger, [...] "I am damned if I am a-going {{to have my}} case spoilt, or interfered with, or anticipated by so much as half a second of time by any human being in creation. YOU want more painstaking and search-making! YOU do? Do you see this hand, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I don't know {{the right time to}} stretch it out {{and put it on the}} arm that fired that shot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Archer turned {{towards her}} in the darkness, and she could clearly {{perceive}} that he smiled upon her very kindly. [...] "There spoke a sweet nature," [...] said he, [...] "and I must thank you for these words. But I would not have you fancy that I regret the past for any happiness found in it, or that I fear the simplicity and hardship of the country. I am a man that has been much tossed about in life; now up, now down; <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I shall {{not be able to}} support what you support--you who are kind, and therefore know how to feel pain; who are beautiful, and therefore hope; who are young, and therefore (or am I the more mistaken?) discontented?" ...|$|E
6000|$|DOROTHY. Yours is the blame; we are {{no longer}} equal. You have robbed me of the right to marry any one but you; <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> me, then, so poor in spirit as to accept a husband on compulsion? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What better {{could the}} boys be taught than {{to fight for}} the good cause? Why, no one is a scratch the worse for it. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we could sit by and see our best friend used worse than a dog?' ...|$|R
5000|$|The song {{exists in}} two versions. One is {{found on the}} {{explicit}} editions, in which lead singer Pierre Bouvier sings the word fucks in the second verse (<b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about me when he fucks you). In the music video and for radio play, the word is omitted and sometimes replaced with touches (<b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about me when he touches you). This is the second song in which Simple Plan uses fuck, after the demo version of [...] "I'm Just a Kid" [...] (changed to hell in the final studio version, though they still use fuck in live performances). The verses' chord progressions are similar to Green Day's [...] "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" [...] and Oasis' [...] "Wonderwall".|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} foolish, Terence," [...] she said, almost with a laugh, [...] "as foolish {{as you were}} at Coimbra. Do you think that I should have said what I did, then, if I had not meant it? Did you not save me, {{at the risk of}} your life, from what would have been worse than death? Have you not been my hero, ever since? Have you not been the centre of our {{thoughts}} here, the great topic of our conversation? Have not your father and I been as proud as peacocks, when we read of your rapid promotion, and the notices of your gallant conduct? <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it would make any difference to me, if you had come back with both your legs and arms shot off? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heaven grant he may rue it! Would {{that her}} bosom were knives and fish-hooks, {{like that of}} the statue in the fairy-tale. See what he has done for us! He is Earl not only of his own lands, but he has taken poor Morcar's too, and half his earldom. He is Earl of Huntingdon, of Cambridge, they say,--of this ground on which we stand. What right have I here now? How can I call on a single man to arm, as I could in Morcar's name? I am an outlaw here and a robber; and so is every man with me. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> William did not know that? He saw well enough what he was doing when he set up that great brainless idol as Earl again. He wanted to split up the Danish folk, and he has done it. The Northumbrians will stick to Waltheof. They think him a mighty hero, because he held York-gate alone with his own axe against all the French." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 2. He cannot, {{after he}} hath {{come to the}} soul as a spirit of {{adoption}}, come again as a spirit of bondage to put the soul into his first fear; to wit, a fear of eternal damnation, because he cannot say and unsay, do and undo. As a spirit of adoption {{he told me that}} my sins were forgiven me, that I was included in the covenant of grace, that God was my Father through Christ, that I was under the promise of salvation, and that this calling and gift of God to me is permanent, and without repentance. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> after he hath told me this, and sealed up the truth of it to my precious soul, that he will come to me, and tell me that I am yet in my sins, under the curse of the law and the eternal wrath of God? No, no, the word of the gospel is not yea, yea; nay, nay. It is only yea, and amen; it is so, [...] "as God is true" [...] (2 Cor 1:17-20).|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's their natur', tearful and cheerful. Ah's me! They {{are very}} {{pleasant}} to {{us of the}} woods; <b>and</b> I <b>do</b> believe I should think all right, whatever Mabel might <b>do.</b> <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Jasper, that she thought of me at all on that joyful occasion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whatever was her reason," [...] Sanders admitted, [...] "Jean wouldna {{open the}} door; but I keeked {{in at the}} parlor window, and saw Mrs. Dishart in't looking very cosy-like <b>and</b> lauching; <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I would hae seen that if I had come ower the minister?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What are {{you afraid}} of?" [...] {{one of the men}} in the stern shouted. [...] "Cannot a fisherman's boat row out without being {{threatened}} with shooting? What are you and your sixteen armed men doing on board? Are you expecting a French fleet off the coast? <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> will beat them off if they board you? How long have the Glasgow traders taken to man their ships with fighting men?" ...|$|R
