5000|$|Hitchhiking in Poland has a {{long history}} and is still popular. It was legalised and formalised in 1957 so hitchhikers could buy {{booklets}} including <b>coupons</b> from travel <b>agencies.</b> These <b>coupons</b> were given to drivers who took hitchhikers. By the end of each season drivers who collected the highest number of coupons could exchange them for prizes, and others took part in a lottery.

5000|$|In the 1950s, Ogilvy {{was hired}} to {{increase}} business in Puerto Rico.

50|$|She also {{proposed}} changing {{the name of}} the Food Stamps Program, noting that the <b>agency</b> now uses <b>coupons,</b> not stamps. She suggested that the name does not reflect the mission of reducing hunger and improving nutrition for those with low-income. She suggested removing the cap on dependent care deduction for the Food Stamp Program. The policy at the time was $200 per month for children under 2 and $175 for other dependent children. Another proposal was removing combat-related military pay as a cause for families to no longer be eligible for Food Stamps.|$|R

500|$|Don and Roger Sterling (John Slattery) {{meet with}} Rachel Menken (Maggie Siff), the Jewish {{owner of a}} large {{department}} store. Roger, feeling uncomfortable due to the novelty of having a Jewish client, enlists the only Jewish person in the company, {{a young man who}} works in the mailroom, to attend the meeting, disguised {{as a member of the}} art department, in order to make Rachel feel comfortable. Rachel, looking to attract wealthier customers, is disappointed by the <b>agency's</b> suggestions of <b>coupons</b> to attract frugal housewives. The meeting becomes heated, with Don angry that a woman would talk to him in such a commanding way, and Rachel angry that the men will not respect her bold plans for the family business. A later meeting with executives from Lucky Strike tobacco company also appears to go badly, as Don still struggles to find a new approach to cigarette advertising. Pete suggests the [...] "death wish" [...] idea put forth by the company's research, but the executives reject his idea. Just when it seems that the meeting is over, Don comes up with a new tagline—"It's toasted!"—along with a strategy that ignores the question of health risks while extolling the virtues of the supposedly unique way that Lucky Strikes are prepared. The client is impressed, but Don is furious at Pete for literally fishing through Don's trash can to uncover and revive something Don had explicitly rejected.|$|R
