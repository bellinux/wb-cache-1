40|$|Raw Millefiori honey {{is packed}} full of {{antioxidants}} Abstract Honey {{is the natural}} substance produced by honeybees, Apis mellifera, in almost every country of the world. Raw honeys are usually produced by small farms and left in their natural state without undergoing processing (e. g., filtration and heat treatment). Honey is essentially a concentrated aqueous solution of inverted sugar, but it also contains a very complex mixture of other saccharides, enzymes, amino and organic acids, polyphenols, carotenoid-like substances, Maillard reaction products, vitamins, and minerals. Among minor honey constituents, polyphenols such as flavonoids and phenolic acids, may function as natural antioxidants in our diet. In recent years, considerable interest has been focussed on dietary antioxidants in reference to their protective effect against oxidative damage. There are many studies about the polyphenol content and antioxidative effects of fruits, vegetables and beverages; in contrast, hardly any work has been reported with honey. Available literature indicates that no previous antioxidant power {{studies have been done}} on Italian honeys; thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate antioxidant activity of two representative Italian raw honeys,, i. e., Millefiori and Acacia, obtained from beekeepers belonging to the same geographical region (central Italy) as a function of their sensorial characteristics and content of total polyphenols and flavonoids. Total polyphenols, flavonoids and antioxidant power of samples from Millefiori and <b>Acacia</b> raw <b>honey</b> varieties were evaluated. Phenolic content, expressed as caffeic acid equivalents, ranged from 12. 5 to 17. 5 mg/ 100 g and from 3 to 11 mg/ 100 g in Millefiori and <b>Acacia</b> <b>honeys,</b> respectively. All Millefiori samples exhibited the highest flavonoid concentration being between 1. 23 and 2. 93 mg catechin equivalents (CE) / 100 g honey. Total flavonoids in 100 g <b>Acacia</b> <b>honeys</b> were in the range of 0. 45 – 1. 01 mg CE. <b>Acacia</b> <b>honeys</b> had lower total antioxidant power, as assessed by ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay, than Millefiori. The relationship between phenolic content and antioxidant power was discussed. These results demonstrated a strong correlation between honey colour and antioxidant power, with darker and more crystallized honeys having stronger antioxidant activity than lighter and transparent honeys [...] Comparative experimental analysis was performed with an artificial honey and processed honeys. Raw Millefiori honey is rich in both amount and variety of antioxidant substances, and its inclusion in the diet may be recommended to complement other polyphenol sources...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activity of horse chestnut honey and <b>acacia</b> <b>honey</b> at different concentrations against clinical isolates of the β- hemolytic streptococci group A (BHS-A). Honey’s active compounds have multiple therapeutic effects and it is used as traditional medicine for treatment and prevention of various illnesses. Materials and methods: The antimicrobial effects of two honeys were tested on forty-four strains of BHS-A, isolated from the throat by a modified disk diffusion method. A bacterial suspension of BHSA strains was plated onto Müller-Hinton agar with 5 % defibrinated horse blood. Using a sterile 8 mm diameter cork borer, wells were cut in the agar and into each was introduced 100 µL of the different concentrations of the honey solution (25 %v/v, 50 %v/v, 75 % v/v and 100 %v/v). A disk of penicillin was added as the positive control. The plates were incubated aerobically for 18 - 24 hours at 36 (± 1) °C and zones of inhibition were measured. Results: The average diameter of the inhibition zones of <b>acacia</b> <b>honey</b> (100 %v/v) was 12. 48 mm ± 1. 73 mm, for <b>acacia</b> <b>honey</b> (75 %v/v) it was 11. 06 mm± 1. 24 mm and for horse chestnut honey (100 %v/v) it was 11. 08 mm ± 1. 02 mm.

Significant reductions in excess weight gain and adiposity index were observed in rats fed with Gelam honey compared to HFD rats. Moreover, levels of plasma glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol, plasma leptin and resistin, liver enzymes, renal function test, and relative organ weight in Gelam and <b>Acacia</b> <b>honey</b> treated groups were reduced significantly when compared to rats fed with HFD only. Similar results were also displayed in rats treated with orlistat, but with hepatotoxicity effects. In conclusion, consumption of honey {{can be used to}} control obesity by regulating lipid metabolism and appears to be more effective than orlistat...|$|E
40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{extraction}} and identification of honey proteins from selected samples (Acacia, Tualang, and Gelam) from Malaysia. The extraction methods, dialysis, ammonium sulfate, and sodium tungstate precipitation methods, were used to obtain the proteins from the honey. The method of membrane dialysis provided the highest yield of proteins based on the Bradford assay. This method also provided {{the highest number of}} protein bands and the clearest protein bands on a 12 % polyacrylamide gel compared with the other two precipitation methods. The results revealed that the precipitation methods may degrade the proteins because of the use of strong chemicals and losses after repeated transfers. Mass spectrometric data showed that the honey contained major royal jelly proteins (MRJP) such as MRJP- 1, MRJP- 2, MRJP- 5, and MRJP- 7, as well as a few uncharacterized proteins from Apis mellifera. MRJP- 1 was the most abundant protein, particularly in <b>Acacia</b> samples. <b>Honey</b> proteins were also shown to possess significant antioxidant activity as free radical scavengers and reducing agents...|$|R
25|$|The aromas {{and flavor}} notes of Chenin blanc often include the {{descriptors}} of minerally, greengage, angelica and honey. Chenin wines produced from noble rot will often have notes of peaches and honey that develop into barley sugar, marzipan, and quince as they age. Dry or semi-sweet Chenin blanc from the Loire will often have notes apple, greengage, and chalky minerals that develop into more <b>honey,</b> <b>acacia,</b> and quince aromas. New World styles of Chenin, {{such as those}} of South Africa, are more often made to be consume young and exhibit rich tropical fruit notes such as banana, guava, pear, and pineapple. The alcohol level for dessert styles Chenin rarely goes above 12%, which keeps the wines more in balance. Drier styles of Chenin {{are more likely to be}} around 13.5%.|$|R
40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} recently demanded {{search for}} alternative antimicrobial compounds, as {{excessive use of}} available antibiotics is linked with making the problem worst. Honey’s antimicrobial property and activity, which were well {{known for a long}} time, has rekindled interest for the therapeutic application of honey in the treatment of bacterial infection. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are important clinical pathogens involved in skin and wound infections worldwide. It is therefore imperative to find effective antimicrobial agents against these pathogens. This study was undertaken to assess the antimicrobial activity and composition of a range of honeys including Chestnut, Kashmir, Hadramy, <b>Acacia</b> and Blossom <b>honey.</b> Putative synergistic activity of honey was investigated using antibiotic discs including Ampicillin (AP), Chloramphenicol (C), Penicillin G (PG), Streptomycin (S), Sulphatriad (ST), Tetracycline (T) and Azaleic acid. Manuka honey was used in the study for comparative purposes. The honeys were tested at 75...|$|R
