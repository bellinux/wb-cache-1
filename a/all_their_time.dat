5|$|Orangutans live {{in primary}} and old {{secondary}} forests, particularly dipterocarp forests and peat swamp forests. Both species {{can be found}} in mountainous and lowland swampy areas. Sumatran orangutans live at elevations as high as 1500m (4921ft), while Bornean orangutans live no higher than 1000m (3281ft). Other habitats used by orangutans include grasslands, cultivated fields, gardens, young secondary forest, and shallow lakes. Orangutans are the most arboreal of the great apes, spending nearly <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> in the trees.|$|E
5|$|Logan tells Parker that he {{will not}} be seeing her in the summer because he will be on a surfing trip with Dick. Mac (Tina Majorino) and Max (Adam Rose) spend <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> together. Piz tells Veronica about another {{internship}} in Neptune, but she dodges his attempts to ask which one he should take. Keith meets Liam Fitzpatrick (Rod Rowland), who states that the robberies will not stop. Apollo learns that Veronica was not assigned by the school paper, and Veronica tells him the truth, but he refuses a paternity test. Some people begin to grow dissatisfied with Keith’s handling of the robberies, while Apollo’s father claimant appears in Neptune. Veronica searches for Apollo, learning from his former roommate that Apollo did not actually write the book, and he was never a child soldier. However, Wallace (Percy Daggs III) urges her not to expose him as a hoax, as his book as actually helping charities that aid child soldiers.|$|E

25|$|Homosexual pair-bonding can be {{established}} several ways; two of the main ways are pair bonding as partners or as companions. As partners, both animals will engage in sexual activities with each other. In companions bonding, sexual engagement is not necessary in the relationship. This form of homosexuality {{is more of a}} partnership and friendship; they spend <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> together. More than 70 species of birds engage in one of these two bonding.|$|E
25|$|Their {{contract}} with Virgin Records had {{now become a}} burden to both Henry Cow and Virgin: none of Henry Cow's records were licensed or distributed in the countries in which they spent <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> playing, and Henry Cow were not making any money for Virgin. Henry Cow needed to record again but Virgin refused to give them studio time at The Manor. When Henry Cow referred to the contract ("one month at a first class studio"), Virgin Records (in October 1977) agreed to cancel it.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the ongoing rebellion by Hone Heke in the mid-1840s, the government encouraged retired but fit British soldiers and their families to migrate to Auckland to form a defence line around the port settlement as garrison soldiers. By the time the first Fencibles arrived in 1848, the rebels in the north had been defeated. Outlying defensive towns were then constructed to the south, stretching in {{a line from the}} port village of Onehunga in the West to Howick in the east. Each of the four settlements had about 800 settlers; the men were fully armed in case of emergency, but spent nearly <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> breaking in the land and establishing roads.|$|E

It's possible to read deeper meanings into it, but it sort of defeats the purpose because in the end it's just this hypnotic clip of animation.|$|R

25|$|In essence, this {{technique}} is a statistical method of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on. Imagine {{if you were to}} observe the behavior of normal, paying customers at a brick-and-mortar department store. On average, they would spend in aggregate a known percentage of time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back on shelves, trying on clothes, filling a basket, waiting in line, paying for their purchases, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. For example, if a huge number of customers arrive and spend <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> picking up items and setting them down, but never making any purchases, this can be flagged as unusual behavior.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{had a major}} impact; humans {{began to}} affect the {{environment}} as never before. Surplus food allowed a priestly or governing class to arise, followed by increasing division of labor. This led to Earth's first civilization at Sumer in the Middle East, between 4000 and 3000 BC. Additional civilizations quickly arose in ancient Egypt, at the Indus River valley and in China. The invention of writing enabled complex societies to arise: record-keeping and libraries served as a storehouse of knowledge and increased the cultural transmission of information. Humans {{no longer had to}} spend <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> working for survival, enabling the first specialized occupations (e.g. craftsmen, merchants, priests, etc...). Curiosity and education drove the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom, and various disciplines, including science (in a primitive form), arose. This in turn led to the emergence of increasingly larger and more complex civilizations, such as the first empires, which at times traded with one another, or fought for territory and resources.|$|E
25|$|The {{fortunes}} of the Ladyshore were intimately connected with the Fletcher family and their ties to local politics. The colliery was founded by Thomas Fletcher Senior, under the name Thomas Fletcher & Sons. Thomas Sr (1805–1893) {{was chairman of the}} Little Lever Local Board (effectively the town council) from 1872 until 1879. He had a brother John who, whilst part of the colliery business, kept in the shadows. On the death of Thomas Sr, Thomas Junior took over the mines with his brother Matthew. Thomas Jr became the Mayor of Bolton in 1884 and remained in office until 1887. Thomas' brother Matthew kept out of direct control of the colliery but maintained the family links to politics by becoming the Chairman of the Little Lever Local Board (1893–1894) and then Chairman of the Little Lever Urban District Council in 1895. Thomas Sr died leaving £163,000, which was, in those days, a substantial sum of money. The activities of Thomas Sr and Thomas Jr meant that they could not devote <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> to the colliery, so John's son Herbert Fletcher (1842–1895), also a member of Bolton town council, took control of the colliery and was named as the owner in the infamous court case over safety lamps. Herbert {{died of a heart attack}} at the colliery on 16 September 1895. Despite owning a coal mine, Herbert was active in the area of preventing smoke pollution and published several papers on smoke control, his most read being in the Journal of the Royal Society for the Promotion of Health.|$|E

2500|$|Though she was {{the eldest}} daughter, Charlotte was {{constantly}} compared to her sister Augusta Sophia, only two years younger than she. [...] When Augusta was a month old, Lady Mary Coke called her [...] "the most beautiful baby I have ever seen" [...] while Charlotte was [...] "very plain". Passing judgment once again three years later, Charlotte was now [...] "the most sensible agreeable child I ever saw, but in my opinion far from pretty" [...] while Augusta was still [...] "rather pretty". Although the Princess Royal was never as beautiful as her younger sister, she did not share in Augusta's primary flaw: painful shyness, though Charlotte did suffer from a stammer that her attendant Mary Dacres tried to help her young charge overcome. In 1770, the cluster of the three eldest princesses was completed {{with the birth of}} Princess Elizabeth, the seventh child. For the time being the family remained comparatively small (there were fifteen royal children in all), and Charlotte was fortunate in having parents who preferred spending time with their numerous children to spending <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> at court and took her education seriously. However, given the frequency with which children were being produced and the troubles that plagued George III's reign, Charlotte's childhood was not as utopian as her parents planned it to be.|$|E

2500|$|B. cephalotes {{breed in}} the early autumn, when the {{temperature}} is still warm and the air still dry in most of their habitats. [...] The eggs are deposited in deep into the sandy soil of their habitats during late summer and early autumn. [...] The site of egg deposits is determined and prepared by the female beetle. [...] After the eggs are laid there is no parental care; it extends to choosing an appropriate site for the eggs and no further. [...] The eggs hatch and the larvae develop in the subterranean tunnels during the winter and early spring. [...] The larvae spend <b>all</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> below the surface, and consequently, are not well studied. [...] Most of the knowledge of larvae is derived from a few studies and {{is focused on the}} diet of the larvae. [...] The adult beetles emerge from the subterranean burrows in the late spring and early summer. [...] The latest the beetles emerge in generally in early July. [...] The period of reproduction generally spans from the end of July to mid-September, with the first larvae developing at the end of August. [...] This can lead to some members developing on a one-year schedule and others developing on a two-year schedule. [...] However, most die after their first year of life, only reproducing once. [...] Some specimens have been kept alive in laboratories for much longer.|$|E
