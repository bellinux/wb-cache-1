40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to {{identify}} the key factors that explain the decision of Chinese small and medium sized enterprises' (CSMEs) investment into the North East of England. The authors conducted 23 semi-structured interviews with key decision makers of Chinese SMEs that have business operations in the North East of England. It {{has been found that}} there are four major categories of factors that drive Chinese SMEs' investment into the North East of England: 1) resource-based factors; 2) home and host institutional factors; 3) network factors; and 4) international entrepreneurial factors. The findings have policy implications for both the governments of the UK and China, as well as managerial implications for <b>future</b> Chinese <b>investors.</b> <b>This</b> chapter provides fresh explanation of Chinese SMEs' investment into a developed economy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{representativeness}} heuristic is {{a psychological}} bias which means that, under uncertainty, investors {{are prone to}} believe that a history of a remarkable performance of a given firm is “representative” of a general performance that the firm will continue to generate into the <b>future.</b> <b>Investors</b> subjects to <b>this</b> heuristic overreact, thus, to salient and similar information about firms past performance such as similar consecutive earnings surprises. I have examined this relationship on the Tunisian stock market using accounting and stock market data over the period 1990 - 2010. Weak evidence has been found concerning this relationship. The results show a partial association between past earnings surprises and future abnormal returns explained by negative earnings surprises autocorrelation...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} stocks, indices and other assets, are {{examples}} of stochastic processes with unpredictable dynamics. In this paper, we discuss asymmetries in short term price movements {{that can not be}} associated with a long term positive trend. These empirical asymmetries predict that stock index drops are more common on a relatively short time scale than the corresponding raises. We present several empirical examples of such asymmetries. Furthermore, a simple model featuring occasional short periods of synchronized dropping prices for all stocks constituting the index is introduced with the aim of explaining these facts. The collective negative price movements are imagined triggered by external factors in our society, as well as internal to the economy, that create fear of the <b>future</b> among <b>investors.</b> <b>This</b> is parameterized by a ``fear factor'' defining the frequency of synchronized events. It is demonstrated that such a simple fear factor model can reproduce several empirical facts concerning index asymmetries. It is also pointed out that in its simplest form, the model has certain shortcomings. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{value of}} stocks, indices and other assets, are {{examples}} of stochastic processes with unpre-dictable dynamics. In this paper, we discuss asymmetries in short term price movements {{that can not be}} associated with a long term positive trend. These empirical asymmetries predict that stock index drops are more common on a relatively short time scale than the corresponding raises. We present several empirical examples of such asymmetries. Furthermore, a simple model featuring occasional short periods of synchro-nized dropping prices for all stocks constituting the index is introduced with the aim of explaining these facts. The collective negative price movements are imagined triggered by external factors in our society, as well as internal to the economy, that create fear of the <b>future</b> among <b>investors.</b> <b>This</b> is parameterized by a “fear factor ” defining the frequency of synchronized events.

If a risk is possible though unlikely, should management disclose it? If the risk should be disclosed, how prominently should it be disclosed? These questions highlight the temporal conflict: disclosure of a possible risk harms a firm 2 ̆ 7 s current investors, and the more prominent the disclosure, the greater their harm; but failure to disclose the risk, or to give sufficient prominence to the disclosure, may harm the firm 2 ̆ 7 s <b>future</b> <b>investors.</b> The article 2 ̆ 7 s purpose is both positive and normative: to explain the conflict and its attendant problems, and to help resolve the conflict by analyzing, in each case, who {{should be included in}} the relevant audience...|$|R
