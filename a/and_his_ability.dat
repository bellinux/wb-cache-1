5|$|Among Cincinnati receivers, {{there was}} none of the {{uncertainty}} that afflicted the Bearcats' quarterbacks. Wide receiver Mardy Gilyard caught 74passes during the regular season, setting a Cincinnati record with 1,118receiving yards. He also had 10touchdowns during the season, leading all Cincinnati players. Gilyard also played as the Bearcats' primary kick returner. He returned 32kicks, accumulating a school-record 897yards and 2touchdowns. Fellow wide receiver Dominick Goodman outpaced Gilyard in receptions with 78, but he had only 977receiving yards and 7touchdowns. On the first play of Cincinnati's game against Hawaii, Dominick injured his shoulder <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> {{to play in the}} Orange Bowl was in doubt.|$|E
5|$|At age seven de Candolle {{contracted}} of {{a severe}} case of hydrocephalus, which significantly affected his childhood. Nevertheless, {{he is said}} to have had great aptitude for learning, distinguishing himself in school with his rapid acquisition of knowledge in classical and general literature <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to write fine poetry. In 1794, he began his scientific studies at the Collège Calvin, where he studied under Jean Pierre Étienne Vaucher, who later inspired de Candolle to make botanical science the chief pursuit of his life.|$|E

5|$|David John Cawdell Irving (born 24 March 1938) is an English Holocaust denier {{and author}} {{who has written}} on the {{military}} and political history of World War II, {{with a focus on}} Nazi Germany. His works include The Destruction of Dresden (1963), Hitler's War (1977), Churchill's War (1987), and Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich (1996). In his works, he argued that Hitler did not know of the extermination of Jews or, if he did, opposed it. Though Irving's revisionist views of World War II were never taken seriously by mainstream historians, he was once recognised for his knowledge of Nazi Germany <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to unearth new historical documents.|$|E
5|$|Execution by {{elephant}} was {{a common}} method of capital punishment in South and Southeast Asia, particularly in India, where Asian elephants were used to crush, dismember, or torture captives in public executions. The animals were trained and versatile, able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's absolute power <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to control wild animals.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, {{one of his}} paintings, Telemachus Rescues Antiope {{from the}} Fury of the Wild Boar, was finally {{accepted}} for the Summer Exhibition. Etty was becoming widely respected at the Royal Academy for his painting, particularly his use of colour <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to produce realistic flesh tones, and from 1811 onwards {{had at least one}} work accepted for the Summer Exhibition each year. However, he had little commercial success and generated little interest over the next few years.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to changes in}} the tone of the show, Noah has also implemented stylistic changes to the show, with an updated set, new graphics and his monologue sometimes taking place while {{standing in front of a}} screen as opposed to sitting at the desk. Trevor also increased the usage of more millennial based references, impersonations & characterisations for his comedy on the show, due to his younger demographic <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to speak in multiple accents and eight languages.|$|E
5|$|Many of the henchmen {{employed}} by the villains may have unique weapons; Oddjob, Auric Goldfinger's enforcer, carries a bowler hat with a razor-sharp blade concealed in the rim, while Xenia Onatopp is known to crush victims to death with her thighs during intercourse. In addition to these weapons, many of the henchmen are physically different; the over-large Tee Hee had an iron claw, Jaws, an assassin with steel teeth, was played by 2.18m (7'2") actor Richard Kiel, whilst Renard (the henchman to the main villainess Elektra) survived being shot in the head, which progressively killed off his senses <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to feel pain.|$|E
5|$|Patton's {{colorful}} image, hard-driving {{personality and}} {{success as a}} commander were at times overshadowed by his controversial public statements. His philosophy of leading from the front <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to inspire troops with vulgarity-ridden speeches, such as a famous address to the Third Army, attracted favorable attention. His strong emphasis on rapid and aggressive offensive action proved effective. While Allied leaders held sharply differing opinions on Patton, he was regarded highly by his opponents in the German High Command. A popular, award-winning biographical film released in 1970 helped transform Patton into an American hero.|$|E

5|$|Tonelli {{retired after}} the Games. His aquatic success was not derived from any {{physical}} advantage, {{as he was}} relatively small for a swimmer. He was only 185cm tall and weighed 70kg, with relatively small hands and feet. Tonelli felt that his success was based around his ability to make fast starts from the blocks, and attributed his success to his mental approach <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to convert his energy into a fast swim in under one minute. He had a deliberate strategy of making himself nervous before the race, feeling that he thrived on pressure.|$|E
5|$|A complete, consistent, hardworking and {{versatile}} midfielder, Alonso {{is regarded as}} one of the best players of his generation, and is effective both creatively and defensively. Gifted with good technique, excellent vision, and varied passing range, he excels in the centre in a deep-lying playmaking role, where he can best use his accurate long passing ability to create goal scoring chances for teammates; he also possesses a powerful and accurate shot from distance, and he is an effective set-piece and penalty kick taker. Due to his height, positioning, and physical characteristics, Xabi Alonso is also effective in the air, often contributing with headed goals from set pieces when advancing into more offensive positions. In addition to his creative attributes, he is also capable of excelling as a defensive midfielder due to his strength and powerful physique, combined with his tenacity, tactical intelligence, aggressive tackling <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to read the game. He has at times been criticised, however, for occasionally committing rash challenges and for his tendency to lose his composure and pick up unnecessary cards for particularly hard fouls.|$|E
5|$|A less violent side to Alexander's {{government}} {{is demonstrated by}} other evidence. Over a century after his time, his administrative decisions were still being cited as precedents. Some of these are known from a surviving edict issued on July 6, 68, {{less than a month}} after Nero's death. This denounces, and introduces measures against, a variety of abuses including inaccurate tax assessments, malicious prosecutions and the imprisonment of debtors by private creditors. The edict's only allusion to the chaotic political situation comes as a call for trust in the benevolence of the new Emperor, Galba, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to put right the wrongs of the past. Alexander was making representations to Galba on behalf of the provincials, presumably representing the desired reforms as the price of loyalty from this vital grain-producing province.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{speculation}} {{that he would}} lead the team, as Bradman had made himself unavailable due to concerns over fitness <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to play at his pre-war world-leading standards, the Australian Board of Control appointed Bill Brown as captain and O'Reilly as Brown's deputy. In the Board's ballot for the leadership positions, Hassett received {{only one of the}} 13 votes, although it was enough to make him the third on-tour selector. One motive speculated for his being overlooked was that he had rested himself from the match against Victoria because he was tired of the long periods in the military away from his family and decided instead to spend the time in Melbourne with his wife and young daughter; this supposedly drew the ire of the Victorian Cricket Association.|$|E
5|$|Froome, who {{had been}} second in the 2011 and 2014 Vueltas, had had a strong season, with {{victories}} in the , the Critérium du Dauphiné and the Tour de France. He was attempting {{to become the first}} rider since Bernard Hinault in 1978 to win both the Tour and the Vuelta in the same season, though it was expected that he would be tired following his victory in the Tour. The individual time trial was expected to favour Froome, who is strong in the discipline. Before the race, however, Froome was uncertain about his form <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to win the race. Quintana's only stage race victory of the season had come in the Tirreno–Adriatico, but he had performed strongly in the Alps in the Tour's final stages, and the mountainous route of the Vuelta was expected to suit him.|$|E
5|$|Gan {{was later}} taken as an {{apprentice}} by Guthrie and Company.

Gan was subsequently promoted to the post of Assistant Storekeeper and then Chief Storekeeper of the company. In 1874, he became the company's Chief Compradore, a position which he held for the next 25 years. Scott later helped to finance some of Gan's early business ventures, one of which was to supply labour and transport to the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company which helped Gan make most of his personal fortunes.|$|E

5|$|Macandal {{is a black}} slave, first {{introduced}} on the same plantation as Ti Noel. He is admired for his qualities that are irresistible to black women <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to captivate men. He regales tales of great kingdoms and speaks of epic battles in which the animals were allies of men, of the incarnation of the serpent, of a queen who was the Rainbow, and of horses adorned with silver coins. Macandal has his left arm amputated after a machinery accident on the plantation of Lenormand de Mezy and, unable to complete heavy work, is {{put in charge of}} pasturing the cattle. He departs for the mountains and discovers many secret herbs, plants, and fungi about which he is taught more by an old, mysterious woman who is something of a witch. Macandal leaves the plantation, attains the ability to transform into various beings, and is represented as having superhuman powers due to his possession by the gods.|$|E
5|$|Manga and anime {{publications}} have {{commented on}} Kira's character, and he received mainly positive critical responses. IGN's Andy Patrizio said Kira's character was likable {{and the only}} problem he found was how he often repeated Athrun Zala's name in early episodes. THEM Anime Reviews' Derrick L. Tucker said {{he was one of}} the strongest characters from the series; Tucker also said he was likable despite his angsty displays. Tucker also compared him with Amuro Ray from the first Gundam series, Mobile Suit Gundam, finding both likeable. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment liked Kira's handling of the mobile suits <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to reprogram them, finding it as a new concept in the Gundam franchise.|$|E
5|$|Midas is a verse {{drama in}} blank verse by the Romantic writers Mary Shelley and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Mary wrote the drama and Percy contributed two lyric poems to it.
