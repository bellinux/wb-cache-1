Type of TiO 2 materials using a <b>transparent</b> <b>and</b> non <b>transparent</b> paste. Deposisition of TiO 2 layers using by screen printing method. The screen has various types as follows : T- 49, T- 55 and T- 61. After the deposition of TiO 2 layers then sintering at a temperature of 500 oC. The thickness measurenment of TiO 2 coating obtained from cross-sectional images by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Optical properties of absorbance using UV-Vis Spectrophotometer. The results of TiO 2 thin films with using a screen printing T- 49 have a thickness (3. 2 ± 0. 3) µm and (54 ± 4) µm for <b>transparent</b> <b>and</b> non <b>transparent</b> paste.

5|$|Lithium fluoride, artificially {{grown as}} crystal, is clear <b>and</b> <b>transparent</b> and {{often used in}} {{specialist}} optics for IR, UV and VUV (vacuum UV) applications. It {{has one of the}} lowest refractive indexes and the furthest transmission range in the deep UV of most common materials. Finely divided lithium fluoride powder has been used for thermoluminescent radiation dosimetry (TLD): when a sample of such is exposed to radiation, it accumulates crystal defects which, when heated, resolve via a release of bluish light whose intensity is proportional to the absorbed dose, thus allowing this to be quantified. Lithium fluoride is sometimes used in focal lenses of telescopes.|$|E

Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced {{with a set of}} three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through red, green and blue filters <b>and</b> <b>transparent</b> prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.|$|E

In March 2009, Rajoelina was declared by the Supreme Court as the President of the High Transitional Authority, an interim governing body responsible for moving the country toward presidential elections. In 2010, a new constitution was adopted by referendum, establishing a Fourth Republic, which sustained the democratic, multi-party structure established in the previous constitution.

5|$|Sodium at {{standard}} temperature and pressure is a soft silvery metal that combines with oxygen in air and forms grayish white sodium oxide unless immersed in oil or inert gas, {{which are the}} conditions it is usually stored in. Sodium metal can be easily cut with a knife and is a good conductor of electricity and heat because it has only one electron in its valence shell, resulting in weak metallic bonding and free electrons, which carry energy. Due to having low atomic mass and large atomic radius, sodium is third-least dense of all elemental metals {{and is one of}} only three metals that can float on water, the other two being lithium and potassium. The melting (98°C) and boiling (883°C) points of sodium are lower than those of lithium but higher than those of the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium, following periodic trends down the group. These properties change dramatically at elevated pressures: at 1.5 Mbar, the color changes from silvery metallic to black; at 1.9 Mbar the material becomes transparent with a red color; and at 3 Mbar, sodium is a clear <b>and</b> <b>transparent</b> solid. All of these high-pressure allotropes are insulators and electrides.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 18th century, {{the island of}} Madagascar was ruled by a {{fragmented}} assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances. Beginning in the early 19th century, most of the island was united and ruled as the Kingdom of Madagascar {{by a series of}} Merina nobles. The monarchy collapsed in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the French colonial empire, from which the island gained independence in 1960. The autonomous state of Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed republics. Since 1992, the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at Antananarivo. However, in a popular uprising in 2009, president Marc Ravalomanana was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009 to Andry Rajoelina. Constitutional governance was restored in January 2014, when Hery Rajaonarimampianina was named president following a 2013 election deemed fair <b>and</b> <b>transparent</b> by the international community.

5|$|The rotund to {{ellipsoid}} spores are 7.5–10µm {{long and}} 6–7.6µm wide. The surface ornamentation extends to 0.5µm high and is mainly from warts and short, wide ridges, which are linked through few fine lines {{to form an}} incomplete net (reticulum). The suprahilar area, a distinctly limited zone above the , is weakly amyloid. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 45–60 × 9.5–12µm. They are roughly cylindrical to somewhat club-shaped and often have an oil droplet or a granular body. The sterigmata are 4.5–5.5µm long. The thin-walled pleurocystidia are sparse, but somewhat common near the gill edge. They are protruded and are 45–65µm long and 5–8µm wide, they are sometimes smaller near the gill edge. Nearly spindle-shaped, they are often straightened or constricted like a string of pearls at the apex. The body is often fine and grained. Pseudocystidia are largely present. They are 4–6µm wide and are sometimes protruded, but are often shorter than the basidioles (basidia in the early developmental stage). The basidioles are cylindric to spiral and have an ochre-coloured substance, similar to the laticifers. Near the top they are, however, almost hyaline (transparent). The gill edge is usually sterile and has a few to many cheilocystidia. The thin-walled cheiloleptocystidia are 15–25µm long and 5–10µm wide. They are almost club-shaped or irregularly shaped <b>and</b> <b>transparent,</b> and often contain a granular material. The cheilomacrocystidia are also thin-walled and measure 25–50µm long and 6–8µm wide. They are slightly spindle-shaped and often have a tip resembling a string of pearls; their interior is hyaline or granular. Laticifers are abundant, striking and body is ochre coloured. The cuticle of the cap is an ixocutis, whereby the hyphae are linked in a jellylike matrix, that can swell up in moisture to become heavily slimy.|$|E
