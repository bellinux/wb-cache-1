5|$|After their {{extraordinary}} early successes, {{beginning with}} Oklahoma! in 1943, Rodgers and Hammerstein had written two musicals in the 1950s {{that did not}} do well and sought a new hit to revive their fortunes. Lee's novel focuses on a father, Wang Chi-yang, a wealthy refugee from China, who clings to traditional values in San Francisco's Chinatown. Rodgers and Hammerstein shifted {{the focus of the}} musical to his son, Wang Ta, who is torn between his Chinese roots <b>and</b> <b>assimilation</b> into American culture. The team hired Gene Kelly to make his debut as a stage director with the musical and scoured the country for a suitable Asian – or at least, plausibly Asian-looking – cast. The musical, much more light-hearted than Lee's novel, was profitable on Broadway and was followed by a national tour.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitism {{was common}} in Germany and {{throughout}} Europe during this period, and Manstein's {{attitude towards the}} Jews had its roots in his exposure to <b>and</b> <b>assimilation</b> of these views. His actions were a reflection of his loyalty toward Hitler and the Nazi regime and of his grounding {{in a sense of}} duty based on traditional Prussian military values. His criticism of Hitler was based solely on their disagreements over the conduct of the war, not about the regime's racial policies. Some historians, including Antony Beevor and Benoît Lemay, are of the opinion that Manstein had some Jewish ancestry. Manstein was the only Reichswehr officer who opposed the introduction of the Aryan paragraph in 1934. He sent a letter of protest to General Beck, commenting that anyone who had volunteered to serve in the armed forces had already proven their worth.|$|E

5|$|Ole Juulson Kvale was a Minnesota congressman of the Farmer-Labor Party, and a proud Norse-American. Kvale was {{a member}} of the Norse-American Centennial Commission, which was to {{organize}} a 100th anniversary celebration of the Restauration voyage. This celebration was important to a Norse-American community that had been perceived as antiwar during World War I, and was attempting to display both ethnic pride <b>and</b> <b>assimilation.</b> Kvale, a Lutheran minister, was also a member of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, and in January 1925 approached the Treasury Department, seeking its support for a commemorative coin in honor of the anniversary; he was told that the Treasury would oppose it. Commemorative coins for ethnic heritage groups were unlikely to pass Congress at that time due to the controversy caused by the 1924 Huguenot-Walloon Tercentenary half dollar, seen by some as Protestant propaganda.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} coalesced, {{first into}} clans (ubwoko) and into about eight kingdoms by 1700. The country was fertile and densely populated, with its kingdoms strictly controlled socially. The Kingdom of Rwanda, {{ruled by the}} Tutsi Nyiginya clan, became increasingly dominant beginning in the mid-18th century. From its origins as a small toparchy near Lake Muhazi the kingdom expanded through conquest <b>and</b> <b>assimilation,</b> reaching its zenith under King (Mwami) Kigeli Rwabugiri between 1853 and 1895. Rwabugiri expanded the kingdom west and north, implementing administrative reforms which included ubuhake (where Tutsi patrons ceded cattle—and privileged status—to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service) and uburetwa (a corvée system in which Hutu were forced to work for Tutsi chiefs). Rwabugiri's reforms developed a rift between the Hutu and Tutsi populations.|$|E
5|$|This last attempt {{effectively}} {{ended the}} Prussian Crusade and the Knights concentrated on conquering Samogitia and Lithuania. Lithuanian historians note that fierce resistance by the Prussians won {{time for the}} young Lithuanian state to mature and strengthen so it could withstand the hundred-year crusade, culminating in the 1410 Battle of Grunwald, with minimal territorial losses. The Prussian lands were repopulated by colonists from Germany, who after the 16th century eventually outnumbered the natives. It is estimated that around 1400 Prussians numbered 100,000 and comprised {{about half of the}} total population in Prussia. The Prussians were subject to Germanization <b>and</b> <b>assimilation</b> and eventually became extinct sometime after the 16th century. It is believed that the Prussian language became extinct sometime {{at the beginning of the}} 18th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} coalesced, {{first into}} clans (ubwoko), and then, by 1700, into around eight kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda, {{ruled by the}} Tutsi Nyiginya clan, became the dominant kingdom from the mid-eighteenth century, expanding {{through a process of}} conquest <b>and</b> <b>assimilation,</b> and achieving its greatest extent under the reign of King Kigeli Rwabugiri in 1853–1895. Rwabugiri expanded the kingdom west and north, and initiated administrative reforms which caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations. The Berlin Conference of 1884 assigned the territory to Germany, which began a policy of ruling through the Rwandan monarchy, and supporting Tutsi chiefs around the country. Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, and from 1926 began a policy of more direct colonial rule. The Belgians modernised the Rwandan economy, but Tutsi supremacy remained, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised. In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards labelling each individual as either Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. While it had previously been possible for particularly wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, the identity cards prevented any further movement between the groups.|$|E
