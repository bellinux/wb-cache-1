40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the cyclical behaviour of markups, using a panel of Spanish manufacturing firms over the period 1990 [...] 1998. Margins are estimated from the optimal conditions derived from the firm"s optimisation problem, which assumes that labour inputs are subject to adjustment costs. A number of results emerge from the estimations. First, we find positive and asymmetric adjustment costs for permanent labour inputs. Second, price [...] cost margins are markedly procyclical. Our estimates suggest that labour adjustment costs more than double the variability of average margins with respect to Lerner indexes. Third, we find differences in the parameters of the <b>adjustment</b> <b>technology</b> across industries which make markups of intermediate and production good industries more cyclical than consumer good industries. Finally, industry [...] specific price [...] cost margins are higher in more concentrated industries. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2003. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – To date, orbital {{and ground}} image data have been mostly {{separately}} processed for topographic mapping in Mars landed missions. We {{are in the}} process of developing a method for the integration of orbital and ground image networks to enhance precision mapping. In this research, HiRISE stereo images were used as orbital data while ground data include MER-B Pancam stereo images and their pointing information. The process of estimating unknown exterior orientation parameters for the HiRISE images is explained. For orbital image processing, a semi-automatic hierarchical stereo matching technique based on image pyramid is introduced. A bundle adjustment of HiRISE stereo pair is performed. Incremental bundle <b>adjustment</b> <b>technology</b> is employed to process MER ground images, to construct a ground image network and to improve rover localization accuracy. Also, digital terrain models (DTMs) and orthophotos of Victoria Crater have been generated from the HiRISE stereo pair and are compared with those derived from the networked ground imagery. I...|$|E

30|$|The {{analytical}} {{literature has}} {{paid little attention}} to <b>adjustments</b> in agricultural <b>technology</b> and productivity, which are typically associated with shifts in supply curves, when examining the effects of RTAs on agricultural trade and welfare through the conventional frameworks. This paper contributes to the literature by analyzing the implications of RTA-induced <b>adjustments</b> in agricultural <b>technology</b> and productivity for the effects of RTAs on agricultural trade and welfare. It investigates the relationship between RTAs and agricultural technology and productivity in the context of Viner’s (1950) conventional partial equilibrium framework with perfectly elastic foreign supply schedules faced by the importing member country. It also examines this relationship in the context of Pomfret’s (1986) extended partial equilibrium framework depicting upward-sloping foreign supply schedules for the importing member country.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A robot {{automatic}} drilling {{system was}} established {{according to the}} processes of drilling CFRP on aircraft wings. Investigations were conducted to study the key technologies of this system. First, a surface-normal <b>adjustment</b> <b>technology</b> based on laser displacement sensors was developed. Then influnce of press foot pressure on hole precision was investigated. Based on the thrust force in CFRP drilling experiment, an empirical formula was established using binary linear regression analysis, proper processing parameters(spindle speed 12000 rpm, axial feed 0. 02 mm/r) were determined. At last, experiment on tool wear was conducted to determine the cutter life. Results show that this system can increase the efficiency and quality of drilling CFRP on aircraft wings. The surface-normal accuracy is better than 0. 5 °, the aperture error is less than 0. 02 mm, the roundness error is less than 0. 005 mm, the surface roughness could achieve Ra 3. 2 and the efficiency is 5 holes per minute...|$|E
40|$|This paper studies nominal rigidities using a novel scanner {{data set}} {{consisting}} of weekly prices, costs and quantities sold for {{a cross-section of}} retailers in Chile. Nominal rigidities are found to {{take the form of}} reference price inertia. While posted prices change every 5 weeks (on average), reference prices change every two quarters (29 weeks), on average. Frequencies of reference price adjustment are found to be systematically related to cost volatility and expenditure shares. In addition, the probability of a reference price adjustment is increasing in the markup gap. While frequencies of reference price adjustment vary systematically across chains, markups vary within narrow bounds and pass-through coe ¢ cients conditional on a reference price change are high (on the order of 0. 86 - 0. 93) suggesting that movements in reference prices are closely related to movements in prices at the previous stage of the distribution chain. Synchronization of price changes across stores appears to be particularly strong across stores belonging to a given chain. Evidence on within-stores and categories synchronization is consistent with a price <b>adjustment</b> <b>technology</b> featuring economies of scope...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{discrete}} model of investment behavior that incorporates general nonstatic expectations {{with a general}} cost of <b>adjustment</b> <b>technology.</b> The combination of these two features usually leads {{to a set of}} highly nonlinear first order conditions for the optimal input plan; the expectational variables work in addition as shift parameters. Consequently, an explicit analytic solution for derived factor demand is in general difficult if not impossible to obtain. Simplifying assumptions on the technology and/or the form of the expectational process are therefore typically made in the literature. In this paper we develop an algorithm for the estimation of flexible forms of derived factor demand equations within the above general setting. By solving the first order conditions numerically at each iteration step this algorithm avoids the need for an explicit analytic solution. In particular we consider a model with a finite planning horizon. The relationship between the optimal input plans of the finite and infinite planning horizon model is explored. Due to the discrete setting of the model the forward looking behavior of investment is brought out very clearly. As a byproduct a consistent framework for the use of anticipation data on planned investment is developed. ...|$|E
40|$|What role does labor play in {{the market}} value of firms? According to the {{standard}} neoclassical model—a benchmark for our exploration—labor is not a part of this value, because it is costlessly adjusted and hence receives its share in output. In this frictionless environment, the firm’s mar-ket value equals its stock of physical capital. When combining this setup with adjustment costs of physical capital as in James Tobin (1969) or Tobin and William Brainard (1977), the well-known Tobin’s Q-model results. Adjustment costs of capital involve implementation costs, the learning of new technologies, or the fact that production is temporarily interrupted. The stan-dard Q-model assigns no explicit role for labor, as determination of the firm’s value requires only correction for the value of the capital <b>adjustment</b> <b>technology.</b> Labor explicitly enters the picture whenever there are frictions in the labor market (see the discussion in Jean-Pierre Danthine and John B. Donaldson 2002 a). With frictional labor markets, labor is a quasi-fixed factor from which a firm extracts rents. These rents compensate it for the costs associated with adjusting the work force. The firm’s value captures these rents. In this paper we investigate links between the financial market and the labor market. Toward this end, we build on the production-based model for firms ’ market value proposed by John H. Cochrane (1991, 1996) and insert labor and capital adjustment costs as crucial ingredients. We let the adjustment costs for labor interact with those for capital, with all adjustment cost...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{the thesis of}} the {{research}} and development project entitled: Development of a Resource Saving Concept for the Establishment of a Climate Suitable for the Storage of Objects Worthy of Preservation in Storerooms at Museums and in Archives. In short: The ZEPHYR project. This work {{is the result of a}} research and development project. The aim is to improve the possibilities of using passive climate control for museum, archive and library repositories. Passive climate control implies that the repository is built and arranged so the thermal and hygroscopic properties of the building and its contents creates a good stable indoor climate. Passive climate control also ensures that the temperature and relative humidity stay within the acceptable ranges. It is an alternative to the traditional mechanical climate control with humidifiers, dehumidifiers and cooling and heating installations controlled by complex control and <b>adjustment</b> <b>technology.</b> The mechanical method has been used since the late fifties, from time to time with varying degrees of success. The knowledge of the thermal and hygroscopic interaction between a building and its contents, influenced by a certain local climate, is further developed in this project. Therefore, theoretical studies and measurements carried out at the Regional Archive of Schleswig-Holstein, which is passive climate controlled, are completed. On this basis a calculation model has been developed, which makes it possible to do parameter studies of the climatic influence of the building structures and the building material. The results of the measurements are used to compare the theoretical performance of the building with the actual performance. Taking the operational conditions into consideration, the building can be designed to be the framework of a stable storage environment at low operating costs and a minimal energy consumption. A new constant is defined: The Buffering Capacity Factor. It is a factor that defines materials capabilities in buffering (stabilizing indoor climate) thermal or humidity variations. Due to this, the principles of the ZEPHYR Climate Controlled Repositories is introduced and so is the concept Sustainable Storage...|$|E

40|$|We {{report that}} the price of a 6. 5 oz Coke was 5 ¢ from 1886 until 1959. Thus, we are documenting a nominal price {{rigidity}} that lasted more than 70 years! The case of Coca-Cola is particularly interesting because during the 70 -year period there were substantial changes in the soft drink industry as well as two World Wars, the Great Depression, and numerous regulatory interventions and lawsuits, which led to substantial changes in the Coca-Cola market conditions. The nickel price of Coke, nevertheless, remained unchanged. We find that this unusual rigidity is best explained by (1) a contract between the Company and its parent bottlers that encouraged retail price maintenance, (2) a single-coin vending machine technology, which limited the Company’s price adjustment options due to limited availability and unreliability of the existing flexible price <b>adjustment</b> <b>technologies,</b> and (3) a single-coin monetary transaction technology, which limited the Company’s price adjustment options due to the customer “inconvenience cost. ” We show that these price adjustment costs are of a different nature than the standard menu cost, and their estimates exceed the existing estimates by an order of magnitude. A possible broader relevance of the nickel Coke phenomenon is discussed in the context of Nickel and Dime Stores, which were popular in the US in the late 1800 s and the early 1900 s. ...|$|R
