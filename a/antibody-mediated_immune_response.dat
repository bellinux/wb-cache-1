40|$|Malaria in {{pregnancy}} poses a great health risk to {{mother and her}} fetus and results into complications, such as abortion, still birth, intra uterine growth retardation, and low birth weight. The heavy infiltration of Plasmodium falciparum-infected RBCs in the intervillous spaces of placenta seems {{to be responsible for}} all the complications observed. Infected RBCs in the placenta cause an inflammatory environment with increase in inflammatory cells and cytokines which is deleterious to the placenta. Increased inflammatory responses in the infected placenta result into oxidative stress that in turn causes oxidative stress-induced placental cell death. Moreover, heat shock proteins that are produced in high concentration in stressed cells to combat the stress have been reported in fewer concentrations in malaria-infected placenta. Pathologies associated with placental malaria seems to be the effect of a change in immune status from <b>antibody-mediated</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> to cell-mediated immune response resulting into excess inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and decreased heat shock protein expression.

The appearance of dinitrochlorobenzene-induced skin dermatitis matched in timing the appearance of the circulating dinitrochlorobenzene-specific antibodies. Adoptive transfer of sera containing dinitrochlor-obenzene-specific antibodies from dinitrochlorobenzene-treated mice elicited a much stronger hypersensitivity reaction than the adoptive transfer of lymphocytes from the same donors. Moreover, dinitrochlorobenzene-induced contact hypersensitivity was strongly suppressed in B cell-deficient mice with no DNCB-specific antibodies. It was also observed that treatment of animals with dinitrochlorobenzene polarized Th cells into Th 2 differentiation by increasing the production of Th 2 cytokines while decreasing the production of Th 1 cytokines.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Subunit and inactivated {{vaccines}} are a safer {{but less}} immunogenic alternative to live attenuated vaccines. Adjuvants are often added to subunit and inactivated vaccine formulations to boost immune responses. Aluminum mineral adjuvants {{are the most}} commonly used adjuvants in human vaccines and are strong stimulators of <b>antibody-mediated</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response.</b> However, aluminum adjuvants elicit weak or absent cell-mediated T H 1 and cytotoxic CD 8 T-cell responses. As an alternative adjuvant, calcium phosphate (CaP) is an ideal material due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability. Additionally, CaP has been used as an adjuvant in approved human vaccines in several European countries. When CaP is precipitated {{in the absence of a}} capping agent, large polydisperse and polymorphous micron-sized particles are formed. Particle size has been shown to be an important parameter for vaccine antigen carriers and adjuvants, and particles in the nanometer size range are of particular interest due to their unique cellular uptake and biodistribution properties. CaP binding dodecapeptides selected by cell surface display biopanning were used in E. coli thioredoxin A derivatives (TrxA::CaP) and thioredoxin A derivative-ovalbumin fusion proteins (TrxA::CaP-OVA) to mineralize sub- 100 nm CaP nanoparticles (NPs). Addition of CaP NP adjuvant to TrxA::CaP-OVA vaccine formulations significantly increased the population of antigen specific splenic effector-memory CD 8 + T-cells in immunized mice after challenge with WSN-OVA I, an OVA expressing influenza A strain. Due to autoimmunity concerns, the thioredoxin A derivative CaP mineralization agents were replaced with a disulfide-constrained cyclic peptide containing an identified CaP binding motif (cPN 38). Addition of cyclic peptide mineralized CaP NPs to OVA vaccine formulations, increased sensitization of antigen-specific IFN-gamma (T H 1 cytokine) secreting splenocytes in immunized mice. As compared to protein antigen vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines containing pDNA or mRNA encoding genes are advantageous due to their ease of production, inherently immunogenicity, and ability to target the endogenous MHC-I loading pathway. When added to OVA pDNA vaccines, CaP NPs increased antigen-specific humoral and splenocyte IFN-gamma responses. Conversely, CaP NPs had no adjuvant effect in OVA mRNA vaccines. Increased cell-mediated (T H 1) and cytotoxic (CD 8) T-cell responses were observed when CaP NP adjuvant was added to OVA protein and pDNA vaccine formulations. As an alternative adjuvant to aluminum compounds, CaP NP adjuvants may be effective in vaccines against intracellular pathogens in which an <b>antibody-mediated</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> alone is insufficient for protective immunity...|$|E

METHODS: Data from the placebo group of a phase 2 trial testing monoclonal antibodies to C. difficile toxins A and B for preventing CDI recurrence (rCDI) were analyzed to assess risk factors associated with rCDI. Patients with symptomatic CDI taking metronidazole or vancomycin were enrolled. The primary outcome was rCDI within 84 days of treatment start. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression {{was used to examine}} associations between potential risk factors and rCDI. At baseline, demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded; endogenous antibody levels were assessed using 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.

40|$|By using pigs {{sensitized}} to {{bovine serum}} albumin (BSA), {{it was found}} that exposure of the intestinal mucosa to BSA induced, in 4 h, the emigration of large numbers of neutrophils into the intestinal lumen.

The emigration of neutrophils through the intestinal mucosa was not accompanied by the edema, hemorrhage, and thrombosis which were apparent after intracutaneous inoculation of BSA into the same animals. Twenty-four hours after a 4 -h mucosal exposure to BSA, the intestinal mucosa showed no evidence of neutrophil emigration nor any other abnormal features. These observations suggested that emigration of neutrophils into the intestinal lumen can be a specific, <b>antibody-mediated</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> which occurs in the absence of intestinal injury.

Lewis rats receiving TGF-β 1 -exposed DC developed very mild symptoms of EAMG without loss of body weight compared with control EAMG rats receiving naive DC or PBS.

The Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) -induced/purified protein derivative (PPD) -elicited tuberculin skin test is a reliable measure of DTH; however, its use to identify livestock with high CMIR may be confounded due to previous exposure to Mycobacteria tuberculosis.

Its hydrophobic properties, due to the high concentration of lipids, shelter the canal from physical damages, while other components probably protect against certain microbial strains. Nevertheless there has been considerable dispute in the literature with regard to the antibacterial activity of cerumen. Because of the importance of the role of immunoglobulins (Ig) in local defense mechanisms, we attempted to study, by immunohistochemical methods, the presence and localization of the cells necessary to activate an Ig-mediated immune response and the epithelial expression of immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) in order to obtain information about a local immune response in those areas of the skin that take part in cerumen production.

Data from cytokine measurements and transcriptomics profiles in TS patients are coherent with the systemic immune activation detected by studies on lymphocyte subpopulations. Moreover, TS patients have exhibited IgG 3 and IgA dysgammaglobulinemia, which might predispose to recurrent infections and autoimmunity. To date, the {{association between}} TS and autoantibodies has not been demonstrated. Interestingly, however, there is a higher degree of maternal family history of autoimmune diseases among TS patients. Finally, TS patients could be prone to allergic illnesses (asthma, atopic dermatitis, rhinitis, conjunctivitis), but more work is needed in this area...|$|R
40|$|Dinitrochlorobenzene-induced contact {{hypersensitivity}} {{is widely considered}} as a cell-mediated rather than <b>antibody-mediated</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response.</b> At present, very {{little is known about}} the role of antigen-specific antibodies and B cells in the development of dinitrochlorobenzene-induced hypersensitivity reactions, and this is the subject of the present investigation. Data obtained from multiple lines of experiments unequivocally showed that the formation of dinitrochlorobenzene-specific Abs played an important role in the development of dinitrochlorobenzene-induced {{contact hypersensitivity}}. The appearance of dinitrochlorobenzene-induced skin dermatitis matched in timing the appearance of the circulating dinitrochlorobenzene-specific antibodies. Adoptive transfer of sera containing dinitrochlorobenzene-specific antibodies from dinitrochlorobenzene-treated mice elicited a much stronger hypersensitivity reaction than the adoptive transfer of lymphocytes from the same donors. Moreover, dinitrochlorobenzene-induced contact hypersensitivity was strongly suppressed in B cell-deficient mice with no DNCB-specific antibodies. It was also observed that treatment of animals with dinitrochlorobenzene polarized Th cells into Th 2 differentiation by increasing the production of Th 2 cytokines while decreasing the production of Th 1 cytokines. In striking contrast to the long-held belief that dinitrochlorobenzene-induced contact hypersensitivity is a cell-mediated immune response, the results of our present study demonstrated that the production of dinitrochlorobenzene-specific antibodies by activated B cells played an indispensible role in the pathogenesis of dinitrochlorobenzene-induced CHS. These findings may provide new possibilities in the treatment of human contact hypersensitivity conditions...|$|E
30|$|There is a {{great need}} for new vaccine {{development}} against influenza A viruses due to the drawbacks of traditional vaccines that are mainly prepared using embryonated eggs. The main component of the current split influenza A virus vaccine is viral hemagglutinin (HA) which induces a strong <b>antibody-mediated</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response.</b> To develop a modern vaccine against influenza A viruses, the current research {{has been focused on}} the universal vaccines targeting viral M 2, NP and HA proteins. Crystallographic studies have shown that HA forms a trimer embedded on the viral envelope surface, and each monomer consists of a globular head (HA 1) and a “rod-like” stalk region (HA 2), the latter being more conserved among different HA subtypes and being the primary target for universal vaccines. In this study, we rationally designed the HA head based on the crystal structure of the 2009 -pandemic influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus HA as a model, tested its immunogenicity in mice, solved its crystal structure and further examined its immunological characteristics. The results show that the HA globular head can be easily prepared by in vitro refolding in an E. coli expression system, which maintains its intact structure and allows for the stimulation of a strong immune response. Together with recent reports on some similar HA globular head preparations we conclude that structure-based rational design of the HA globular head can be used for subtype-specific vaccines against influenza viruses.|$|E
40|$|Leishmania is an {{intracellular}} protozoan parasite that {{is transmitted}} by {{the bite of}} the phlebotomine sand fly. There are over 20 species of Leihsmania that infect humans causing a range of diseases from cutaneous - to systemic, potentially fatal infections. The geographic distribution of Leishmania major, responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis, overlaps with several of the more virulent species of Leishmania. This study examined what effect previous exposure to L. major has {{on the outcome of}} infection with Leishmania infantum, the causative agent of highly pathogenic visceral leishmaniasis. The L. major immune response is well characterized with a strong cell-mediated immune response leading to resolution of disease, and protection against subsequent re-infection. A contrasting <b>antibody-mediated</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> leads to disseminated disease. The immune response proteins (cytokine) profile, antibody titer and parasite burden were evaluated in the susceptible BALB/c mouse after L. infantum infection in either naïve mice or those previously infected with a low/self-healing dose of L. major. Using qPCR, expression of the immune protein Interleukin 4, associated with increased antibody response, was found to be significantly increased in mice previously exposed to L. major over controls. Exacerbated disease, with a notably higher parasite burden, was observed in the L. major exposed mice compared to those infected with L. infantum only. Cross-reactive antibodies were seen in both groups of infected mice regardless of their immune history. We speculate cross-reactive antibodies may be playing a role in augmenting visceral disease in mice with immunological memory to L. major...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the incidence rate of clinical mastitis (IRCM) between cows classified as high, average, or low for <b>antibody-mediated</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> (AMIR) and cell-mediated <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> (CMIR). In collaboration with the Canadian BovineMastitis Research Network, 458 lactating Holsteins from 41 herds were immunized with a type 1 and a type 2 test antigen to stimulate adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>responses.</b> A delayed-type hypersensitivity test to the type 1 test antigen was used as an indicator of CMIR, and serum antibody of the IgG 1 isotype to the type 2 test antigen was used for AMIR determination. By using estimated breeding values for these traits, cows were classified as high, average, or low responders. The IRCMwas calcu-lated as the number of cases of mastitis experienced over the total time at risk throughout the 2 -year study period. High-AMIR cows had an IRCM of 17. 1 cases per 100 cow-years, which was significantly lower than average and low responders, with 27. 9 and 30. 7 cases per 100 cow-years, respectively. Low-AMIR cows tended to have the most severe mastitis. No differences in the IRCM were noted when cows were classified based on CMIR, likely due to the extracellular nature of mastitis-causing pathogens. The results of this study demonstrate the desirability of breeding dairy cattle for enhanced <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> to decrease the inci-dence and severity of mastitis in the Canadian dairy industry. Mastitis, generally defined as the inflammation of the mam-mary gland, is a complex disease associated with significant economic loss in the dairy industry (1). Mastitis can be caused by numerous diverse organisms that enter and multiply inside th...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{safe and}} {{effective}} adjuvant {{plays an important role}} in the development of a vaccine. However, adjuvants licensed for administration in humans remain limited. Here, for the first time, we developed a novel combination adjuvant alum-polysaccharide-HH 2 (APH) with potent immunomodulating activities, consisting of alum, polysaccharide of Escherichia coli and the synthetic cationic innate defense regulator peptide HH 2. Methods: The adjuvant effects of APH were examined using NY-ESO- 1 protein-based vaccines in prophylactic and therapeutic models. We further determined the immunogenicity and anti-tumor effect of NY-ESO- 1 -APH (NAPH) vaccine using adoptive cellular/serum therapy in C 57 /B 6 and nude mice. Cell-mediated and <b>antibody-mediated</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> were evaluated. Results: The APH complex significantly promoted antigen uptake, maturation and cross-presentation of dendritic cells and enhanced the secretion of TNF-α, MCP- 1 and IFN-γ by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with individual components. Vaccination of NAPH resulted in significant tumor regression or delayed tumor progression in prophylactic and therapeutic models. In addition, passive serum/cellular therapy potently inhibited tumor growth of NY-ESO- 1 -B 16. Mice treated with NAPH vaccine produced higher antibody titers and greater antibody-dependent/ independent cellular cytotoxicity. Therefore, NAPH vaccination effectively stimulated innate immunity, and boosted both arms of the adaptive humoral and cellular <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> to suppress tumorigenesis and growth of melanoma. Conclusions: Our study revealed the potential application of APH complex as a novel immunomodulatory agent for vaccines against tumor refractory and growth...|$|R
40|$|A simple generic peptide-based vaccine {{structure}} that targets Toll-like receptor 2 -expressing dendritic cells and causes their activation is described. The vaccines are totally synthetic, serve {{as their own}} adjuvant, and are composed of (i) a single helper T cell epitope, (ii) a target epitope that is either recognized by CD 8 + T cells or B cells, and (iii) a Toll-like receptor 2 -targeting lipid moiety, S-[2, 3 -bis(palmitoyloxy) propyl]cysteine, that is situated between the peptide epitopes to form a branched configuration. The different CD 8 + T cell epitopes examined were from (i) influenza virus, (ii) the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, and (iii) ovalbumin as a model tumor antigen. Vaccines containing a B cell epitope from gastrin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone as a B cell epitope were also examined {{for their ability to}} elicit antibody against the parent hormones. Each of the vaccines was capable of inducing either CD 8 + T cell or <b>antibody-mediated</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses.</b> The lipidated vaccines, but not the nonlipidated vaccines, were able to mediate protection against viral or bacterial infection and mediate prophylactic and therapeutic anticancer activity. The two hormone-based vaccines induced high antibody titers, which in the case of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone resulted in abrogation of reproductive function. These results highlight the utility of simple, totally synthetic, epitope-based vaccines...|$|R
