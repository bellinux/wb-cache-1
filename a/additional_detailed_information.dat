50|$|Prenatal {{diagnosis}} and prenatal screening are aspects of prenatal care {{that focus on}} detecting anatomic and physiologic problems with the zygote, embryo, or fetus as early as possible, either before gestation even starts (as in preimplantation genetic diagnosis) or as early in gestation as practicable. They use medical tests to detect problems such as neural tube defects, chromosome abnormalities, and gene mutations {{that would lead to}} genetic disorders and birth defects, such as spina bifida, cleft palate, Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, and fragile X syndrome. The screening focuses on finding problems among a large population with affordable and noninvasive methods, whereas the diagnosis focuses on pursuing <b>additional</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>information</b> once a particular problem has been found, and can sometimes be more invasive. Screening can also be used for prenatal sex discernment. Common testing procedures include amniocentesis, ultrasonography including nuchal translucency ultrasound, serum biomarker testing, or genetic screening. In some cases, the tests are administered to determine if the fetus will be aborted, though physicians and patients also find it useful to diagnose high-risk pregnancies early so that delivery can be scheduled in a tertiary care hospital where the baby can receive appropriate care.|$|E

40|$|Digital terrain models (DTMs) {{in recent}} times have become an {{integral}} part of National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) of many countries world-wide due to their invaluable importance. DTMs play a major role in hydrologic modeling, sediment transport, soil erosion estimation, drainage basin morphology, vegetation, and ecology. DTM generation however has a setback of high cost of primary data input acquisition (i. e. elevation) and complexities in processing. Most DTM data are derived from photogrammetric data, satellite image data, laser scanning data, cartographic data sources, and ground surveys though accurate is expensive, timeconsuming and require skilled personnel. This paper describes a low cost means to generate DTMs where elevation data is not readily available in digital form and when the accuracy of the output is not a dominant factor. The existence of large volumes of hardcopy topographic maps provides a source of primary input in the form of contours which can be digitised and used for DTM generation purposes. This research therefore aims at generating DTMs within a GIS environment using elevations digitized from topographical maps. That is, a geographic information system (GIS) based approach is presented for the development of a terrain model. After digitizing contours and points along contours from a topographic map, various interpolation algorithms were used to generate DTMs and their accuracies in terms of root mean square errors were assessed. The resulting surface model provides a good representation of the general landscape and contains <b>additional</b> <b>detail</b> <b>information</b> (such as slope, aspect, cross-sections, volumes, hillslope) to describe, evaluate and quantify terrain properties. Also, if the digital contours are geo-referenced, they can be readily integrated into existing GIS for 3 D surface visualization and spatial analysis. Results of surface analysis (intervisibility analysis) are presented and among other applications, the DTMs proved useful in surface analysis. 1...|$|R
