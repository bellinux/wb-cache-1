5|$|On June 26, 2007, Maxwell Football Club {{president}} Ron Jaworski {{announced that}} McCoy {{had been named}} to the preseason watch list for the Maxwell Award. The initial list includes 64 players. The winner {{turned out to be}} Tim Tebow. In their 2007 season preview magazine, CBS Sportsline.com listed McCoy as one of twelve players on the “Heisman Watch”; saying “We were touting him for the Heisman midway through his freshman season until he was injured against Kansas State. Older and stronger, McCoy has an awesome receiving corps to make <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hardware for real.” He {{is also one of the}} 35 quarterbacks placed on the 2007 Manning Award watch list. Further, the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award Watch List added McCoy on August 21, 2007.|$|E
5|$|At the 2012 World's Best 10K he came third, {{beaten by}} Sammy Kitwara and Vincent Chepkok. He won the Lisbon Half Marathon {{for the third}} {{straight}} year, but was slower than previous times (59:34) due to warm conditions and having the flu. <b>A</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2012 London Marathon saw him perform better than he did in 2010, but he lost touch with the leading pack after the halfway point and came fourteenth with a time of 2:10:41 hours. He was chosen as Eritrea's flag bearer at the 2012 London Olympics and ran in the 10,000 metres final. He set the pace early on in the race but was defeated in the sprint finish, finishing in sixth place some three seconds behind the winner Mo Farah. After the Olympics he ran at the 2012 World Half Marathon Championships. He dominated the race from just beyond the 5km point, and won it convincingly in a time of 1:00:19 hours, 32 seconds ahead of the runner-up, Deressa Chimsa. Only two weeks later he entered the Great Birmingham Run, but he appeared tired and finished third in a race where the top three all dipped under Haile Gebrselassie's course record.|$|E

5|$|He {{scored a}} {{striking}} {{victory at the}} 2006 IAAF World Road Running Championships in Debrecen, Hungary, finishing the 20km race in 56:01 – a time which was second only to Haile Gebrselassie's world record and was forty seconds faster than the silver medallist Robert Kipchumba. It was first time that an Eritrean had won a major world title in sport. As Zersenay did not possess a strong sprint finish (crucial for success on the track) commentators suggested that a move to the marathon distance seemed an obvious career progression, but he downplayed the idea, stating {{that he would not}} change distances in the near future. He closed the season with <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> New Year's Eve 10km road race: the San Silvestre Vallecana in Madrid. Zersenay and Eliud Kipchoge were awarded the same time of 26:54, but Kipchoge was announced as the race winner. Although this was faster than Haile Gebrselassie's world record of 27:02 at the time, it was not ratifiable as the runners benefited from the race's downhill circuit.|$|E

25|$|After Halas resigned, Gibron {{continued}} {{as an assistant}} under new head coach Jim Dooley in 1968. He switched to coaching the defensive line the following year when assistant coach Joe Fortunato resigned and Jim Ringo was hired to coach the offensive line. Dooley, however, was dismissed in late 1971 after three consecutive losing seasons, including a 1–13 record in 1969. Gibron was elevated to head coach the following January and said the team had the talent to make <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> NFL championship.|$|E

After struggling early, the Flyers made <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> playoffs, but came four points short of the last spot.

In 1937, she appeared in the Rachel Crothers drama Susan and God, and in 1939 starred in Skylark, a comedy by Samson Raphaelson. Lawrence felt the play needed work prior to opening on Broadway, and <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Massachusetts was arranged. The theatre was run by Harvard University graduate Richard Aldrich, and he and the actress became involved in a romantic relationship. The two wed on her birthday in 1940 and remained married until her death in 1952. They had homes in Dennis and in Turtle Bay, Manhattan.|$|E

25|$|Donovan {{grew up in}} Galway {{and took}} part in sports at high school, mainly being {{involved}} in Gaelic football, soccer, and rugby. However, while training for Gaelic football he found a gift for long-distance running. He made his international debut at the 1979 IAAF World Cross Country Championships staged on home soil in Limerick, running in the junior race and placing 54th. He won the intermediate section of the British Schools Cross Country International that year, as well as running in the 3000 metres heats at the 1979 European Athletics Junior Championships.

25|$|In 2002, Salonga {{returned}} to Broadway {{to play the}} leading role of Mei-li, a Chinese immigrant in a reinterpretation of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Flower Drum Song opposite Jose Llana.

The Salonga-led Broadway revival cast album {{was nominated for a}} 2004 Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album. Salonga's performance was received positively by theatre critics in New York, and she received a nomination for Distinguished Performance from the Drama League, among other honors. Between the 2001 Los Angeles and 2002 Broadway productions of Flower Drum Song, she performed in a non-musical theatrical production for the first time, playing the role of Catherine in the stage play Proof in Manila. This was followed by a major concert, The Broadway Concert, at the Philippine International Convention Center. She also sang at the 56th Tony Awards with Harry Connick, Jr., Peter Gallagher and Michele Lee in a number paying tribute to Richard Rodgers.|$|E

25|$|In 2009–10 the Barrie Colts {{celebrated their}} 15th {{season in the}} OHL. The Colts {{attempted}} to make <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Memorial Cup by bringing in proven goal scorers like Bryan Cameron and Luke Pither. They also upgraded their defence by bringing in Nick Crawford, T. J. Brodie and St. Louis Blues draftpick Alex Pietrangelo. Role players like Zac Rinaldo, Matt Kennedy, and goalie Mavric Parks were also traded for before the deadline. All of these trades seemed to have paid dividends as the Colts had a 22-game win-streak, and finished the regular season with an unprecedented record of 57–9–0–2, {{for a total of}} 116 points. Bryan Cameron scored a franchise record 53 goals and the team captured their fourth Emms Trophy for finishing first in the Central Division, and also the franchises first Hamilton Spectator Trophy for finishing first overall in the OHL. Beginning the 2009–10 playoffs the Colts quickly defeated the Sudbury Wolves 4–0 in the Conference Quarter-Finals, before sweeping the Brampton Battalion in the Conference Semi-Finals. In the Conference Finals the Colts finally met some stiff competition but were still able to defeat the Mississauga St. Michael's Majors 4–1 and win the Bobby Orr Trophy. In the J. Ross Robertson Cup finals the Barrie Colts hosted the defending Memorial Cup Champions Windsor Spitfires who the Colts had defeated both times the two teams met in the regular season. The Colts never looked on top of their game, making uncharacteristic defensive mistakes. The Colts were defeated in four games bringing an end to one of the best OHL seasons in history.|$|E
