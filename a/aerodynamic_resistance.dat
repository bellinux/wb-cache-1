They used fluid dynamic {{simulations}} to model the interaction of a vehicle (like that proposed by Alcubierre) with the zero-point field. Vacuum field perturbations are simulated by fluid field perturbations and the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>resistance</b> of viscous drag exerted on the interior of the vehicle is compared to the Lorentz force exerted by the zero-point field (a Casimir-like force is exerted on the exterior by unbalanced zero-point radiation pressures). They find that the optimized negative energy required for an Alcubierre drive is where it is a saucer-shaped vehicle with toroidal electromagnetic fields. The EM fields distort the vacuum field perturbations surrounding the craft sufficiently to affect the permeability and permittivity of space.|$|E

40|$|In {{semi-arid}} areas, where vegetation is sparse and clumped, models used {{to estimate}} evapotranspiration (λE) consider soil and plants as different sources of evaporation. When working at higher scales of heterogeneity, the modelling of surface fluxes introduces effective parameters that enclose the sub-grid heterogeneity. In this work we used both approaches to estimate the λE of a sparse-vegetation patch of Retama sphaerocarpa (L.) Boiss in a semi-arid area in southeast Spain. Firstly, we used a multi-layer model considering plant, soil under plant and bare soil, {{each with its own}} surface and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>resistances</b> and available energy, interacting at a within canopy height. Secondly, we used a single-layer model that uses the effective surface and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>resistances</b> of the patch, calculated by different aggregations of the soil and plant resistances considered in the multi-layer model. The estimates of λE were compared with measured values obtained by an Eddy covariance system. Results show that the use of effective surface resistances aggregated in parallel and effective <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>resistances</b> aggregated in series in a single-layer model produced similar estimates of λE as a multi-layer model. When compared to the measured values, the estimates of the single-layer model were even more accurate than the estimates of the multi-layer model. The results of this paper show that, in areas with low vegetation cover, a simple model, where patch-scale heterogeneity is solved by the use of effective aggregated resistances, is adequate to estimate the patch-scale evapotranspiration. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|URL] aim of {{this paper}} is to {{simulate}} crop interactions with the climate inside a large glasshouse equipped with continuous roof vents. In this prospect, a set of ornamental species was considered. The modelling approach is based on the resolution of the 2 D Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq assumption and a kappa-epsilon closure. Solar and atmospheric radiations were included by solving the Radiative Transfer Equation with the Discrete Ordinate Method and distinguishing short and long wavelength contributions (bi-band model). The crop transpiration was calculated assuming that the canopy may be considered as a porous medium exchanging latent and sensible heat with the ambient environment. The bi-band model was validated under diurnal conditions for a set of external weather conditions (Bournet et al., 2006) and the crop model was validated for lettuce (Boulard and Wang, 2002). In the present study, simulations were conducted under typical summer conditions for eight ornamental species with specific leaf area index values and using the stomatal and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>resistances</b> reported by Baillle et al.

Sites were stratified into nine different ecosystem types: harvested and burnt forest areas, pine forests, spruce or fir forests, Douglas-fir forests, broadleaf deciduous forests, larch forests, wetlands, tundra and natural grasslands. The Penman-Monteith equation was calibrated with variable surface resistances against half-hourly eddy-covariance data and clear differences between ecosystem types were observed. Based on the modeled behavior of surface and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>resistances,</b> surface resistance tightly control E in most mature forests, while it had less importance in ecosystems having shorter vegetation like young or recently harvested forests, grasslands, wetlands and tundra. The parameters of the Penman-Monteith equation were clearly different for winter and summer conditions, indicating that phenological effects on surface resistance are important. We also compared the simulated E of different ecosystem types under meteorological conditions at one site. Values of E varied between 15 % and 38 % of the net radiation in the simulations with mean ecosystem parameters. In general, the simulations suggest that E is higher from forested ecosystems than from grasslands, wetlands or tundra-type ecosystems. Forests showed usually a tighter stomatal control of E as indicated by a pronounced sensitivity of surface resistance to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit. Nevertheless, the surface resistance of forests was lower than for open vegetation types including wetlands. Tundra and wetlands had higher surface resistances, which were less sensitive to vapor pressure deficits.

Both continuous air sampling, which quantifies volatile losses of C- 14 -organic compounds and (CO 2) -C- 14 separately, and the detection of soil residues allow for a mass balance of radioactivity of the C- 14 -labeled pesticides. Recoveries {{were found to be}} > 94 % of the applied radioactivity. The following descending order of cumulative volatilization was observed: chlorpyrifos > parathion-methyl > terbuthylazine > fenpropimorph.

Parameterization of the Pesticide Emission Assessment at Regional and Local Scales (PEARL) model and the Pesticide Leaching Model (PELMO) was performed to mirror the experimental boundary conditions. In general, model predictions deviated markedly from measured volatilization rates and showed limitations of current volatilization models, such as the uppermost compartment thickness, making an enormous influence on predicted volatilization losses.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, the {{modelling}} of greenhouse climate with CFD techniques mainly focussed on {{the understanding of the}} physical behaviour of greenhouses (ventilation, light transmission). Only few numerical CFD studies however, properly describe the interaction of the crop with the local climate and most authors have to cope with a lack of data for validation. The impact of the crop on the climate may be significant as it is known to slow the flow and to exchange heat and mass (water vapour) with the inside ambient air. The present study aims at validating numerical simulations on the basis of both latent and sensible heat transfers occurring at plant level and considering the major climatic/physical components which govern these exchange processes (such as the leaf temperature, or the stomatal and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>resistances).</b> Experiments were conducted in a 100 -m 2 greenhouse compartment. Potted impatiens plants growing on shelves were considered. A set of sensors including a sonic anemometer, thermocouples, air-humidity/temperature probes, pyranometers, pyrradiometers and balances was used to assess the greenhouse micrometeorology and to estimate the heat and mass transfers from the canopy. Two-dimensional simulations were carried out with a computational fluid dynamics software. The calculation domain reduced to a parallelepipedic shape including the plants. The Navier-Stokes equations were solved using the standard k-e turbulence model and a radiative submodel was activated.

40|$|The European Commission is {{preparing}} a strategy to address Heavy-Duty Vehicles (HDVs) CO 2 emissions that, contrary to cars and vans CO 2 emissions, are currently not regulated. Considering the current knowledge gap on HDV CO 2 emissions, an important step {{appears to be the}} development of vehicle simulation, new testing methods and practices and other provisions for vehicle categorization and characterization. In order to investigate the plausibility of the aforementioned simulation-based approach an extensive experimental study was launched by the European Commission DG JRC and DG Climate Change, in collaboration with vehicle manufacturers (DAF, DAIMLER, IVECO) and external consultants (TU- Graz), also referred to as Proof of Concept study. Scope of this report is to summarize the first findings of the Proof of Concept activity and provide further insight with regard to future steps {{in the direction of the}} completion of the CO 2 emissions monitoring and certification framework. As shown, simulation tools can reproduce both real world and chassis dyno performance of Heavy Duty vehicles with satisfactory accuracy. In this exercise and for the HDV categories tested, the simulated fuel consumption results were found always within a +- 3. 5 % range compared to the real world measurement, and in most cases even closer (in the order of +- 1. 5 %). Analysis of different simulation scenarios showed that the declaration method considered, although not finalised yet, can provide results that are representative of the real world performance of HDVs, provided that the appropriate input data are available. The accuracy of the simulation results was not equally high throughout the entire trips investigated, something that is attributed to lack of certain input data, the immaturity of the simulation methodology which is still being optimized and inherited model and measurement inaccuracies. Such deviations are expected to improve significantly in later versions of the methodology. Important effort is being put in the development of methods to generate input data. For the long haul, regional/delivery trucks and coaches the most important parameters are <b>aerodynamic</b> characteristics, rolling <b>resistance,</b> mass, engine map, gearbox map, axle efficiency and driver performance simulation. In the report a methodologies for deriving input parameters for <b>aerodynamic</b> and rolling <b>resistances</b> and engine maps were investigated and proven mature enough to support CO 2 declaration. Further development and validation is necessary for the rest of the input parameters mentioned. For <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>resistances</b> the novel method tested provided results to good accuracy, presented high repeatability and good reproducibility and sensitivity characteristics. Although the declaration methodology in its present form has reached a satisfactory level regarding the ability to quantify CO 2 emissions from specific categories of HDV, there are still issues of importance that should be addressed in the months to come through a possible validation phase and/or a broader pilot phase. Emphasis should be placed on expanding the pool of data available regarding vehicles and components, particularly for HDV categories not investigated in this report, finalize the details of existing input data calculation methodologies, derive default values for non-measurable/non standardized input, optimize the performance of the vehicle simulation software and align the declaration methodology with existing regulatory framework for HDVs.

40|$|An {{efficient}} use of water resources for irrigation requires an accurate estimation of crop water requirements. The traditional approach to estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) {{requires the use of}} a crop coefficient and an estimate of a reference ET. However, crop coefficients depend on crop type, management, and weather conditions and they sometimes lead to large errors in crop ET estimates. The Penman-Monteith (PM) formulation can be used to estimate crop ET without using a crop coefficient if the crop surface and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>resistances</b> are known. PM formulation application also requires weather measurements from above the crop in question; however, this is not possible in everyday applications. This study analyzed the feasibility of using the PM formulation in maize ET estimation and characterized the uncertainties introduced when the weather data are measured above grass. Expressions to estimate aerodynamic and canopy surface resistances were evaluated. Weather measurements from above the maize canopy and above grass were compared. Techniques to translate weather measurements from a nearby weather station with grass cover to a maize canopy were evaluated. Maize ET was estimated separately using measurements taken above the maize canopy and measurements taken above grass and translated to the maize canopy. Eddy covariance measured and estimated maize ET were compared. The results show that the PM formulation can be used to estimate the maize ET. The approach worked reasonably well for a full crop cover under well watered conditions. The critical point was to estimate the surface resistance as a function of climatic variables. Maize ET was estimated with RMSE values that varied between 0. 3 and 0. 78 mm/day when the ET was estimated using weather data measured above the maize canopy. The uncertainty introduced when the maize ET was estimated using weather data measured above the grass was relatively small, the RMSE increased between 0. 12 and 0. 2 mm/day. A different crop management system introduced larger ET estimation differences than the uncertainty introduced when the ET was estimated using weather data measured above the grass. ...|$|R
