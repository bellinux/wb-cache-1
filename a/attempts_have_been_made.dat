5|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae s.l., many <b>attempts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> to form suprageneric classifications, e.g. subfamilies and tribes. Classifications published since the use of molecular methods in phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae (Liliaceae s.s.).

5|$|While {{significant}} <b>attempts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> {{recently to}} identify the exact locations of the individual Upanishads, the results are tentative. Witzel identifies the center of activity in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad as the area of Videha, whose king, Janaka, features prominently in the Upanishad. The Chandogya Upanishad was probably composed in a more western than eastern location in the Indian subcontinent, possibly somewhere in the western region of the Kuru-Panchala country.|$|E
5|$|Tigers {{have been}} studied in the wild {{using a variety of}} techniques. The populations of tigers have been {{estimated}} using plaster casts of their pugmarks, although this method was criticised as being inaccurate. More recent <b>attempts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> using camera trapping and studies on DNA from their scat, while radio collaring has been used to track tigers in the wild. Tiger spray {{has been found to be}} just as good, or better, as a source of DNA as scat.|$|E
5|$|White tigers {{are more}} {{frequently}} bred in captivity, where the comparatively small gene pool {{can lead to}} inbreeding. This has given white tigers a greater likelihood of being born with physical defects, such as cleft palate, scoliosis (curvature of the spine), and strabismus (squint). Even apparently healthy white tigers generally do not live {{as long as their}} orange counterparts. <b>Attempts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> to cross white and orange tigers to remedy this, often mixing with other subspecies in the process.|$|E

5|$|<b>Attempts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> to {{establish}} the exact date of Good Friday by assuming that the darkness described at Jesus's crucifixion was a solar eclipse. This research has not yielded conclusive results, and Good Friday is recorded as being at Passover, which is held {{at the time of}} a full moon. Further, the darkness lasted from the sixth hour to the ninth, or three hours, which is much, much longer than the eight-minute upper limit for any solar eclipse's totality. In the Western hemisphere, there are few reliable records of eclipses before 800 AD, until the advent of Arab and monastic observations in the early medieval period. The first recorded observation of the corona was made in Constantinople in 968 AD.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century revived {{interest}} in Cofresí's piracy {{as a tourist}} attraction, with municipalities in Puerto Rico highlighting their historical connection to the pirates. By {{the second half of}} the century, beaches and sports teams (especially in his native Cabo Rojo, which features a monument in his honor) were named for him; in the Dominican Republic, a resort town was named after the pirate. Cofresí's name has been commercialized, with a number of products and businesses adopting it and its associated legends. Puerto Rico's first flag carrier seaplane was named for him. Several <b>attempts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> to portray Cofresí's life on film, based on legend.|$|E
5|$|With a few exceptions, {{the farther}} a planet or belt {{is from the}} Sun, the larger the {{distance}} between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun.
