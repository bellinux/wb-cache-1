5|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{performing}} a simple dance routine {{surrounded by a}} wall of mirrors and then undressing until she is naked behind a white curtain, revealing only her silhouette. Beyoncé enters the club with a different outfit and hairstyle and some friends. Male patrons seated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> look on. She and Usher notice each other. They meet {{on the dance floor}} and dance intimately. Beyoncé performs an elaborate dance scene with female backing dancers. She swirls around in a champagne glass filled with bubbles. In the final scene, Beyoncé sits atop a piano and after being lifted down by a gentleman, she dances and poses as confetti falls everywhere.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the team}} which remains <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>the</b> {{person who has}} been longest <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> is <b>the</b> one who remains seated, and the other person is the one who moves. Players {{advancing}} to a table may select either available seat.|$|R
2500|$|Beef can {{be cooked}} quickly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> through several techniques. [...] In hot pot cooking, such as shabu-shabu, very thinly sliced meat is cooked by <b>the</b> diners <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> by {{immersing}} it {{in a heated}} pot of water or stock with vegetables. [...] In fondue bourguignonne, diners dip small pieces of beef into a pot of hot oil <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> [...] Both techniques typically feature accompanying flavorful sauces to complement the meat.|$|R
25|$|Because of {{the size}} and weight of the dollar coins, they {{circulated}} minimally throughout their history, except in the West (especially at casinos in the early-to-mid-20th century, where they were commonly used both <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> and at slot machines.) As a result, the coins were generally shipped to Washington and stored in the vaults of the U.S. Treasury; at times these stores numbered into the hundreds of millions.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Harrah's Casinos {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} the WSOP label. Harrah's later purchased London Clubs International (LCI). LCI operates three casinos in the London area: Fifty, Leicester Square, and The Sportsman. After the purchase of these casinos, Harrah's decided to expand its WSOP label into Europe. European casinos typically have a different environment than those in the U.S. Jeffrey Pollack, the WSOP Commissioner, indicated that the WSOPE would have a [...] "style and flair that is both unique and appropriate to the setting. So don't be surprised if we require participants to wear blazers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables.</b> If James Bond were hosting a poker tournament it may look like the World Series of Poker Europe." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{children}} look remarkably healthy, and on Sunday {{were dressed}} with great taste. The living is still of the plainest. In the common dining-hall they assemble in groups <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables,</b> which were without a cloth, and they drink out of tin cups, and pour their water from tin cans. 'It is very plain,' said one to me; 'but we are independent — no man's servants — {{and we are}} content.'" ...|$|E
50|$|Colicchio {{has written}} three cookbooks. He, Jeff Bridges, and Raj Patel {{appeared}} in the documentary film A Place <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> released in <b>the</b> U.S. on March 1, 2013. He is also Executive Producer of A Place <b>At</b> <b>The</b> <b>Table.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{aspect of}} the {{strategy}} of badugi involves {{the number of people}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> more people there are <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>the</b> more likely there is to be a 4-card badugi. Bluffing with a 2 or 3 card hand is not usually advisable when playing at a 6-player table. When playing with fewer than 4 people, bluffing becomes potentially more effective with a three-card hand.|$|R

2500|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "minor arts" [...] {{were very}} important in Byzantine art and luxury items, including ivories carved in relief as formal presentation Consular diptychs or caskets such as the Veroli casket, hardstone carvings, enamels, glass, jewelry, metalwork, and figured silks were produced in large quantities throughout the Byzantine era. Many of these were religious in nature, although {{a large number of}} objects with secular or non-representational decoration were produced: for example, ivories representing themes from classical mythology. [...] Byzantine ceramics were relatively crude, as pottery was never used <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> of the rich, who ate off Byzantine silver.|$|E
2500|$|Kight {{brought his}} {{experiences}} in political action {{into the realm of}} gay rights. [...] One of the first actions by the LA GLF was against a local eatery called Barney's Beanery. [...] The restaurant, located in West Hollywood, not only had a sign above bar that said “Fagots [...] Stay Out”, but also printed up matchbook covers with the same saying. [...] Kight, along with Troy Perry and 100 activists protested outside, sending in protesters occasionally to order coffee and take up space <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables.</b> [...] The protest was initially successful - the owner eventually handed Kight the sign in front of news cameras. [...] But after the media left the owner replaced the sign, where it remained until West Hollywood's first lesbian mayor, Valerie Terrigno, took it down when the city council passed an anti-discrimination ordinance. [...] Perry vowed at the initial protest to never set foot in the place again until the owner apologized, which finally happened in 2005. [...] The new owner, David Houston, has apologized and, among other methods {{to reach out to the}} gay community, holds monthly lunches for disadvantaged gay youth.|$|E
2500|$|The towns {{provided}} huge warehouses, {{still to}} be seen at Provins. Furs and skins traveled in both directions, from Spain, Sicily, and North Africa in the south via Marseilles, and the highly prized vair, rabbit, marten and other skins from the north. From the north also came woolens and linen cloth. From the south came silk, pepper and other spices, drugs, coinage and the new concepts of credit and bookkeeping. Goods converged from Spain, travelling along the well-established pilgrim route from Santiago de Compostela and from Germany. Once the cloth sales had been concluded, the reckoning of credit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> (banche) of Italian money-changers effected compensatory payments for goods, established future payments on credit, made loans to princes and lords, and settled bills of exchange (which were generally worded to expire {{at one of the}} Champagne fairs). Even after trade routes had shifted away from the north-south axis that depended on the Champagne commodities fairs, the fairs continued to function as an international clearing house for paper debts and credits, as they had built up a system of commercial law, regulated by private judges separate from the feudal social order and the requirements of scrupulously maintaining a [...] "good name", prior to the third-party enforcement of legal codes by the nation-state.|$|E

For example, if teams consist of players 1 and 2 versus players 3 and 4, and player 1 breaks, turns alternate {{in the pattern}} 1 (breaking), 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 4, etc. I.e., the ending of a player's turn <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> ends that team's turn <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> As in individual competition, a player's turn <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> does not end until a foul is committed or the player fails to legally pocket an object ball (or the frame ends).|$|R
