40|$|An {{artificial}} surface fihn of {{oleyl alcohol}} {{was produced in}} the North Sea off Sylt Island to investigate the chemical uniformity of the surface filrn and its influence on gas exchange. Oleyl alcohol concentrations found at the sea surface were in good agreement with previously calculated values. Significant differences between fatty acid concentrations before and after production of the artificial film indicated that the natural surface-active substances were pushed aside by the spreading oleyl alcohol, with small <b>amounts</b> <b>replenished</b> from the underlying water later. The same displacement effect was inferred from the strong {{reduction in the number}} of colony-forming units of organotrophic bacteria in the presence of an oleyl alcohol slick. Gas exchange, in this cast dcsorption of CO,, was determined before and after formation of the artificial surface film. In the one experiment performed inhibition of exchange was significant when the film was present: without the film cquilibril~m was achieved after 3. 7 Inin, whereas lmder the influence of the film, it took 5. 7 min to reach equilibrium. Organic surface-active compounds and particulate matter accumulate at th...|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 2008, GoMusic's website changed both aesthetically and functionally. New scripts {{were added}} to simplify the {{download}} process, especially when buying full albums. For a few months prior to this, all options to pay with a debit or credit card dropped off the site, allowing users to pay only by the telepay method. When credit card funding came back after the site re-design, the minimum <b>amount</b> to <b>replenish</b> the account went from $20.00 USD to $30.00 USD, and 3 more pricing tiers above $30.00 were added as well.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} calcination temperature, reaction temperature, and different <b>amounts</b> of <b>replenished</b> lattice oxygen on the partial oxidation of methane (POM) to synthesis gas using perovskite-type LaFeO 3 oxide as oxygen donor instead of gaseous oxygen, which was prepared by the sol-gel method, and the oxides were characterized by XRD, TG/DTA, and BET. The {{results indicated that the}} particle size increased with the calcination temperature increasing, while BET and CH 4 conversion declined with the calcination temperature increasing using LaFeO 3 oxide as oxygen donor in the absence of gaseous oxygen. CO selectivity remained at a high level such as above 92 %, and increased slightly as the calcination temperature increased. Exposure of LaFeO 3 oxides to methane atmosphere enhanced the oxygen migration of in the bulk with time online owing to the loss of lattice oxygen and reduction of the oxidative stated Fe ion simultaneously. The high reaction temperature was favorable to the migration of oxygen species from the bulk toward the surface for the synthesis gas production with high CO selectivity. The product distribution and evolution for POM by sequential redox reaction was determined by <b>amounts</b> of <b>replenished</b> lattice oxygen with gaseous oxygen. The optimal process should decline the total oxidation of methane, and increase the selectivity of partial oxidation of methane...|$|R
5000|$|The anti-terrorism {{emergency}} fund {{clause of}} the Victims of Crime Act was amended. Previously it stated that [...] "the Director may retain any portion of the Fund that was deposited during a fiscal year that was in excess of 110 {{percent of the total}} amount deposited in the Fund during the preceding fiscal year as an emergency reserve" [...] so long as the amount does not exceed $100,000,000. It now reads that [...] "the Director may set aside up to $50,000,000 from the amounts transferred to the Fund in response to the airplane hijackings and terrorist acts that occurred on September 11, 2001, as an antiterrorism emergency reserve" [...] and also details how this <b>amount</b> may be <b>replenished.</b>|$|R
40|$|Significant folate {{deficiency}} in 14 out of 37 preterm infants of birthweights 2. 0 kg or less {{was found to}} be reliably and most conveniently diagnosed by abnormal morphological changes in peripheral blood and confirmed by the response to folic acid. Deficiency appeared to be more common in light-for-dates infants including the smaller of twins. Neither the clinical status nor the levels of haemoglobin or erythrocyte folate was a reliable guide to the presence of megaloblastic erythropoiesis in the very young preterm infant. 100 - 200 microgram folic acid a day, orally or IM, may be required to ensure an optimal haematological response, and this would be appropriate for therapeutic trial if the diagnosis is in doubt. This <b>amount</b> would also <b>replenish</b> tissue folate stores; larger doses are likely to exceed the requirements of small infants...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, various new methodologies for pricing multivariate path {{dependent}} {{options in}} closed form are presented. A splitting direction technique is developed {{to find the}} transition density functions of multi-asset barrier options and occupation time derivatives with one state variable having the barrier feature. Based on the lognormal assumption of the asset price movement, our formulation has been successfully applied to derive the analytical formulas of multi-asset options with external two-sided barriers and sequential barriers, multi-asset step options and delayed barrier options. Analytic price formulas for European quanto options are also derived in this thesis. The success of the analytic tractability of these quanto lookback options depends {{on the availability of}} a succinct analytic representation of the joint density function of the extreme value and terminal value of the stock price and exchange rate. A new perspective of understanding lookback options, a sub-replication and replenishing premium approach, is motivated by the existence of the closed form solution in the quanto lookback case. By choosing an appropriate sub-replication of the option, we are able to represent the option value by the sub-replication and adding a suitable <b>amount</b> of <b>replenishing</b> premium to obtain the price of lookback options. Without limitation to any form of the asset price process, we are able to provide an analytic price presentation for single asset lookbacks, semi-lookbacks and double lookbacks. In practice, such a representation provides nice analytical tractability if the asset price movement follows a Geometric Brownian motion. The contingent claim approach is also useful for modeling risky debts. It allows us to model the option of the issuer to default on the debt contract. We employ the option pricing techniques to examine the fix-float differentials of credit spreads with imposing systematic jump risk. Some characteristics of risky fixed and floating rate debts are reported...|$|R
40|$|Last year’s “Defense of Japan 2007 ” was {{our first}} white paper since the {{transition}} of the Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense. The white paper demonstrated the resolve of the Ministry to become an organization more resilient to crisis and more capable of contributing to the international peace. However, we cannot say that the roughly one year that has passed from that time to the publication of this white paper has been a bright one for the Ministry of Defense and the Self-Defense Forces. During this period, there occurred {{a wide range of}} problems as follows: problems related to thorough implementation of civilian control such as the mistaken reporting of the <b>amount</b> of fuel <b>replenished</b> and the mistaken destruction of log books; problems related to establishment of a strict information security system, such as an information leakage via the Internet and leakage of a Special Defense Secret regarding the Aegis system; problems related to transparency of defense procurement such as excessive billing by suppliers; and misconducts such as the arrest of a former Vice-Minister of Defense on suspicion of bribery. These serious problems have deeply undermined the trust of the people, and I once again offer my sincere apologies for such incidents. Regarding the collision of the MSDF destroyer Atago with the fishing boat Seitoku Maru, which occurred on February 19, 2008, it is unacceptable that the SDF, whose mission is to protect the lives and property of the people, caused such an incident. We deeply regret the occurrence of this accident. We intend to take all preventativ...|$|R
40|$|Rosewood (Aniba rosaeodora Ducke) is an {{endangered}} tree that produces essential oil of high commercial value. However, technical-scientific knowledge about cultivation is scarce and {{studies are needed}} to examine the management viability. The current study evaluated rosewood aboveground biomass management, measuring the export of nutrients resulting from harvesting and testing sustainable management models. The crown of 36 rosewood trees were pruned and 108 trees cut at 50 cm above the soil in two regions in Central Amazonia. Post-harvest performance of sprouting shoots was evaluated and after, sprouting shoots were pruned so that the development of two, three and all shoots was permitted. Nutrient stock estimation was calculated as the product of mass and nutrient concentration, which allowed nutritional replacement to be estimated. The pruning facilitates regrowth by 40. 11 % of the initial mass while by cut regrow 1. 45 %. Chemical attributes of regrowth biomass differed significantly prior to management and regrowth had a significant correlation with the reserves in root tissues and with the pre -management status of the individual tree. Driving sprouts resulted in significantly larger growth increments and may provide a form of management that can viably be adopted. Biomass sequential management resulted in high nutrient exports and the amount of fertilizer needed for replenishment depended on the intensity and frequency of cropping. Compared with the cut of the tree, pruning the canopy reduces fertilizers that are required to <b>replenish</b> <b>amount</b> by 44 %, decreasing to 26. 37 % in the second rotation. The generated knowledge contributes to this silvicultural practice as it becomes ecologically and economically viable...|$|R
