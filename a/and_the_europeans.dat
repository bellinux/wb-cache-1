5|$|At the time, the {{mainland}} south of Elephant Pass was {{claimed by the}} King of Kandy, Senerat; he and his troops were consistently harassing the Portuguese in the Jaffna Peninsula. His wife's two sons, Vijayapala and Kumarasinghe, were also married to princesses from Jaffna. After the fall of Jaffna to the Portuguese, Senarat dispatched a 10,000 strong army to Jaffna {{under the command of}} Mudaliyar Attapattu. The Portuguese withdrew and the Kandyan army occupied Jaffna. The Portuguese General Constantino de Sá de Noronha later attacked with reinforcements from Colombo and defeated Mudaliyar Attapattu's army and seized Jaffna. According to Portuguese and Dutch publications, the last battle for Jaffna was fought between the King of Kandyan kingdom and the Portuguese, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> seized Jaffna from the Kandyan king. Following Portuguese defeat by the Dutch, the Jaffna Mannar islands and most of Jaffna's Vannimai lands had been reincoporated into the Tamil Coylot Wannees Country by the 18th century.|$|E

40|$|The {{relations}} between <b>the</b> United States <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Community under <b>the</b> Nixon Administration (1969 - 1974) were considerably changing. Post- 1945 cooperation and dependence increasingly {{gave way to}} economic competition and division in military and foreign policies. Yet, <b>the</b> United States <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Community {{knew that they were}} strategically important to each other, thus they had to continue cooperation and coordination to defend and advance their economic and strategic interests. With a documentary research approach, this paper aims to examine how <b>the</b> United States <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Community their partnership evolved between 1969 and 1974. It explores the ties that the Nixon Administration designed to bind <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Community <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Community’s responses. It also puts forth that despite their efforts to continue cooperation; the {{relations between}} <b>the</b> United States <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Community were on a downward course.

25|$|Benin {{was never}} a {{significant}} exporter of slaves, as Alan Ryder's book Benin <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> showed. By the early 18th century, it was wrecked with dynastic disputes and civil wars. However, it regained much of its former power in the reigns of Oba Eresoyen and Oba Akengbuda. After the 16th century, Benin mainly exported pepper, ivory, gum, and cotton cloth to the Portuguese and Dutch who resold it to other African societies on the coast. In 1897, the British sacked the city.|$|E
25|$|Conquest {{took place}} gradually, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> {{suffered}} repeated setbacks. A massive Mapuche insurrection {{that began in}} 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death {{and the destruction of}} many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of slavery by the Spanish crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission. Despite royal prohibitions, relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference.|$|E
25|$|The racial {{relations}} between the Noongar people <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> were strained due to these happenings.

They were forced to camp around prescribed areas, including the swamps and lakes north of the settlement area including Third Swamp, known to them as Boodjamooling. Boodjamooling continued to be a main campsite for the remaining Noongar people in the Perth region and was also used by travellers, itinerants, and homeless people. By the gold-rush days of the 1890s, they were joined by miners who were en route to the goldfields.|$|E

But it was a Frenchman, Samuel de Champlain, who made the first {{important}} contribution to the historical record of Mount Desert Island. Champlain led an expedition from the St. Croix Settlement. He was tasked with exploring the coast in a patache with twelve sailors and two American Indian guides. They were in search of a mythical walled and wealthy American Indian city named Norumbega. On September 6, 1604 the expedition crossed Frenchman Bay and sailed towards Otter Creek, where smoke could be seen rising from an American Indian encampment. During high tide the ship hit a ledge off Otter Cliff and while repairing a hole two American Indians boarded the ship as guides.|$|E
25|$|Philip had various {{contacts}} with the Mongol power in the Middle East, including reception at the embassy of the Uyghur monk Rabban Bar Sauma, originally from the Yuan dynasty of China. Bar Sauma presented an offer of a Franco-Mongol alliance with Arghun of the Mongol Ilkhanate in Baghdad. Arghun was seeking to join forces between the Mongols <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Europeans,</b> against their common enemy the Muslim Mamluks. In return, Arghun offered to return Jerusalem to the Christians, once it was re-captured from the Muslims. Philip seemingly responded positively to {{the request of the}} embassy, by sending one of his noblemen, Gobert de Helleville, to accompany Bar Sauma back to Mongol lands. There was further correspondence between Arghun and Philip in 1288 and 1289, outlining potential military cooperation. However, Philip never actually pursued such military plans.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, {{several key}} studies {{focused on how}} trade between {{indigenous}} peoples <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> who had conquered and colonized the Americas influenced indigenous culture, either through change {{in the organization of}} labor, or change in critical technologies. Bernard Mishkin studied the effect of the introduction of horses on Kiowa political organization and warfare. Oscar Lewis explored the influence of the fur trade on Blackfoot culture (relying heavily on historical sources). Joseph Jablow documented how Cheyenne social organization and subsistence strategy between 1795 and 1840 were determined by their position in trade networks linking Whites and other Indians. Frank Secoy argued that Great Plains Indians' social organization and military tactics changed as horses, introduced by the Spanish in the south, diffused north, and guns, introduced by the British and French in the east, diffused west.|$|E

The Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi was the first stadium to host a Test match after independence, a draw against the West Indies in 1948, the first of a 5-Test series. 21 stadiums in India have hosted at least one official Test match.

25|$|Isaac Titsingh can be {{described}} as being the only philosophique employed by the VOC in its almost two hundred years existence and the most sophisticated of all VOC employees in the trading post history of the VOC in Japan (1600-1853). Due to his extensive private correspondence on religious as well as human topics and his endeavours in the exchanges between the outside world and his own, he can be considered as a true philosopher of the 18th century. Compared to the other VOC employees he was a polyglot, who spoke eight languages (Dutch, Latin, French, English, German, Portuguese, Japanese and Chinese). His enthusiasm to introduce the European society to Japanese customs and culture was rooted in his overall passion for Japan and everything Japanese. Therefore, he became a prominent figure, transmitter and interpreter in a two-way cultural, learning and knowledge exchange between the Japanese <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Europeans.</b> For example, he imported Dutch books on European knowledge to Japan. In addition, he collected authentic source materials on Japan, which consisted of the first ever European collection on Japan, entailing printed books, manuscripts, prints, maps, city plans and coins. This collection was thus to form the basis of a then unique history of Japan.|$|E
