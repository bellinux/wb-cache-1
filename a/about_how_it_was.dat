5|$|Although Mansfield's transformations between Jekyll and Hyde {{included}} lighting {{changes and}} makeup designed to appear different under colored filters, it was mainly accomplished by the actor's facial contortions {{and changes in}} posture and movement. As Hyde, Mansfield was hunched over with a grimacing face and claw-like hands; he spoke with a guttural voice and walked differently than he did as Jekyll. The effect was so dramatic that audiences and journalists speculated <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> achieved. Theories included claims that Mansfield had an inflatable rubber prosthetic, that he applied chemicals, {{and that he had}} a mask hidden in a wig, which he pulled down to complete the change.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain {{in a way that was}} beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E

25|$|David Renwick {{wanted to}} write a detective series that dealt with the actual work of {{detection}} rather than action, which most crime dramas appeared to focus on at the time. Also, whereas most of these were about who did it (Inspector Morse or Taggart) and why it was done (Cracker), this new series would be <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> done, with such tropes as murders committed in locked rooms, a person being in two places at once or impossible thefts. Finding a culprit would still be part of the detective's job, but the emphasis would be on discovering how the crime was committed.|$|E
25|$|A {{previously}} unknown manuscript of a 1941 novel by McKay was authenticated in 2012. The manuscript, Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem, {{was discovered by}} Columbia graduate student Jean-Christophe Cloutier in the Samuel Roth Papers, a previously untouched university archive at Columbia University, in 2009. The novel centers on the ideas and events that animated Harlem {{on the cusp of}} World War II (such as Benito Mussoliniâ€™s invasion of Ethiopia). Working in collaboration, Professor Cloutier (now at the University of Pennsylvania) and his advisor Professor Brent Hayes Edwards successfully authenticated the manuscript, and have received permission from the McKay estate to publish the novel, a satire set in 1936, with an introduction <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> found and its provenance verified.|$|E

While there, they learn that an older woman has been found fatally stabbed near the D'haran army; Nicci and Richard determine that it is Sister Tovi. Nicci uses deception to interrogate Tovi, discovering that it was Samuel who stabbed Tovi and took the Box of Orden she was carrying. She also learns about the Chainfire spell, <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> used to obliterate everyone's memory about Kahlan, and that the Boxes of Orden were created in opposition to it.

2500|$|The first {{witness the}} {{prosecution}} called was Martin Bashir, who unsuccessfully fought his subpoena and brought {{an attorney with}} him from ABC.

Judge Melville decided that he would overrule the objections, giving Bashir the choice to either answer or to follow his lawyer's advice, while Melville would review the testimony later to decide whether to charge Bashir with contempt of court.

2500|$|By early 2002, the long-simmering {{feud with}} Martin {{came to a}} head. A {{particular}} concern that had badly strained relations between the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister by early 2002 was Martin's control of the Liberal Party apparatus, especially his control over the issuing of membership forms, which he reserved largely for his own supporters. In January 2002, Brian Tobin complained to ChrÃ©tien that the Liberal Party machinery had been [...] "captured" [...] by Martin's followers {{to the extent that}} it was now virtually impossible for anyone else to sign up their own followers. This posed a major problem for ChrÃ©tien as the Liberals were due to hold a leadership review in February 2003 and owing to Martin's control of the party machinery that it was quite possible that ChrÃ©tien would win by such a slim margin that it would be humiliating or even lose the leadership review. In January 2002, an incident occurred which was to greatly damage ChrÃ©tien's relations with the Liberal caucus. After ChrÃ©tien reorganized the Cabinet in late January 2002, the Liberal M.P. Carolyn Bennett criticised ChrÃ©tien at a caucus meeting for not appointing more women to the Cabinet. ChrÃ©tien exploded with rage at Bennett's criticism, saying that as a mere backbencher she did not have the right to criticise the Prime Minister in front of the caucus, and attacked her with such fury that Bennett collapsed in tears. Health Minister Anne McLellan recalled in an interview that: [...] "He just blew up. Right off the Richter scale!". Even after Bennett had broken in tears and was so distraught that she could no longer stand, ChrÃ©tien gave no mercy and continued to shout abuse at her, leading Intergovernmental Affairs minister StÃ©phane Dion to conclude that ChrÃ©tien wanted to stop his outburst, but was so angry at Bennett that he could not bring himself to do so. Bennett claimed that the Prime Minister's outburst was due to the influence of his communications director, FranÃ§oise Ducros, saying that [...] "Francie was probably telling him what a bitch I was" [...] in pressing for more female ministers (Ducros and Bennett were known to very much dislike each other). After the meeting had ended, much of the Grit caucus went over to offer support for Bennett while pointedly ignoring ChrÃ©tien while the same night Paul Martin and his wife took Bennett and her husband out to dinner at one of Ottawa's more expensive restaurants as consolation. The Liberal M.P. Bonnie Brown was one of the few MPs who defended ChrÃ©tien's tongue-lashing of Bennett, saying [...] "at every single cocktail party she was at, Carolyn Bennett was bad-mouthing the Prime Minister", suggested that Bennett only criticised ChrÃ©tien because he refused to appoint her to the Cabinet, and that [...] "You can't have people in your Cabinet who don't have respect. He's very big on respect". The Bennett incident convinced much of the Liberal caucus that ChrÃ©tien had become a power-crazed bully, and that it was time for the Liberals to have a new leader. Reflecting their displeasure with ChrÃ©tien, in early February 2002 the Liberal caucus elected as their chairman, the outspoken pro-Martin M.P. Stan Keyes (who had already openly mused in 2001 <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time for ChrÃ©tien to go), who defeated the pro-ChrÃ©tien M.P. Steve Mahoney. ChrÃ©tien had expected Mahoney to win, and was reported to be shocked when he learned of Keyes's victory, which now given Martin control of the caucus.|$|E
