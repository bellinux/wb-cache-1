5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of the Genesis, Sega's Consumer Products Research and Development Labs led by manager Tomio Takami were tasked with {{creating}} a CD-ROM add-on for the system, which became the Sega CD. The Sega CD was originally intended to equal the capabilities of the TurboGrafx-CD, but with twice as much random-access memory (RAM), and sell for about JPÂ¥20,000 (or US$150). In addition to relatively short loading times, Takami's team planned for the device to feature hardware scaling and rotation similar to that found in Sega's arcade games, which required the use of a dedicated digital signal processor (DSP). However, two changes made later in development contributed to the final unit's higher than expected price. Because the Genesis' Motorola 68000 CPU was too slow to handle the Sega CD's new graphical capabilities, an additional 68000 CPU was incorporated into the add-on. In addition, upon hearing rumors that NEC planned a memory upgrade to the TurboGrafx-CD, which would bring its <b>available</b> <b>RAM</b> from 0.5 Mbit to between 2 and 4 Mbit, Sega decided to increase the Sega CD's <b>available</b> <b>RAM</b> from 1 Mbit to 6 Mbit. This proved {{to be one of the}} greatest technical challenges during development since the Genesis' access speed was initially too slow to run programs effectively. The cost of the device was now estimated at $370, but market research convinced Sega executives that consumers would be willing to pay more for a state-of-the-art machine. Sega partnered with JVC, which had been working with Warner New Media to develop a CD player under the CD+G standard, to develop the Sega CD.|$|E
25|$|To {{maintain}} {{compatibility with}} older operating systems and applications, the 640 KB barrier remained {{part of the}} PC design even after the 8086/8088 had been replaced with the Intel 286 processor, which could address up to 16 MB of memory in Protected mode. The 1 MB barrier also remained {{as long as the}} 286 was running in Real mode, since DOS required Real mode which uses the segment and offset registers in an overlapped manner such that addresses with more than 20 bits are not possible. It is still present in IBM PC compatibles today if they are running in Real mode such as used by DOS. Even the most modern Intel PCs still have the area between 640 and 1024 KB reserved. This however is invisible to programs (or even most of the operating system) on newer operating systems (such as Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X) that use virtual memory, because they have no awareness of physical memory addresses at all. Instead they operate within a virtual address space, which is defined independently of <b>available</b> <b>RAM</b> addresses.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a project, called "comparative tests on {{commercial}} and newly designed waterrams", carried out by the Delft University of Technology and the Foundation of Dutch Volunteers in Rwanda. The aim of this project was twofold: - to test new, and cheap (i. e. locally constructable and maintainable) types of hydraulic rams, - to compare several commercial types, in order to make a "consumers guide" for developing countries. At the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics of the Delft University of Technology the most essential aspects of the behaviour of commercially <b>available</b> <b>rams</b> were compared. Valve behaviour, delivery head, delivered quantity and efficiency were accentuated. Samples of the rams, tested in the laboratory were checked in Rwanda on reliability, durability and possibilities for local maintenance. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

5000|$|On the IBM PC, all {{the address}} space up to 640 KiB was <b>available</b> for <b>RAM.</b> This {{part of the}} address space is called [...] "conventional memory" [...] since it is {{accessible}} to all versions of DOS automatically on start up.
