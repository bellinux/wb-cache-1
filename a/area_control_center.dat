25|$|The mid-air {{incident}} occurred as flight attendants began to serve drinks onboard Flight 907. JA8904's 'Traffic Collision Avoidance System' (TCAS) sounded 20minutes after its departure as the jet climbed towards 39,000 feet. The DC-10, JA8546, cruised at 37,000 feet. The pilots of both planes had received {{instructions from the}}ir TCAS, but Flight 907 received conflicting instructions from the flight controller at the Tokyo <b>Area</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Center</b> in Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture. Flight 907, headed by 40-year-old pilot , followed an order to descend issued by the flight controller while Flight 958, headed by pilot , descended as instructed by the TCAS, meaning that both planes remained on a collision course.|$|E

The decrease in speed caused the pursuing fighter to overshoot the Boeing and was interpreted by the Soviet pilot as an evasive maneuver. The order to shoot KAL007 down was given as {{it was about to}} leave Soviet airspace for the second time. At around 18:26UTC, under pressure from General Kornukov, and ground controllers not to let the aircraft escape into international airspace, the lead fighter was able to move back into a position where it could fire two K-8 (NATO reporting name: AA-3 [...] "Anab") air-to-air missiles at the plane.|$|E
