In a retrospective study of adult patients with haemophilia in the Western Region of Scotland it was found that 32 patients had experienced 107 separate episodes of haematemesis or melaena. This represents an incidence of 25 per cent of the patients at risk. The commonest cause was peptic ulceration •which was proven in 53 per cent of these patients by serial barium-meal examinations. The diagnosis of the cause of bleeding on the first occasion remains a problem as in only nine out of 32 patients was a probable cause shown. Bleeding as a result of ingestion of salicylates or alcohol was uncommon. When dyspeptic symptoms were used to produce a clinical division of the patients into two subgroups it was found that there was a significantly higher number of patients with a severe grade of haemophilia who were eupeptic when they bled whereas in the dyspeptic group there was a significantly higher number of moderately affected patients. Emergency surgical procedures used to be commonplace to control bleeding but in this series only one patient required emergency surgery. All acute bleeding episodes were controlled by plasma or plasma concentrate and elective surgery performed as necessary. Only one patient died of haemorrhage and he was shown to have a potent <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> inhibitor.

40|$|A {{requirement}} for a minimal threshold level of moisture {{in order for}} efficient virus inactivation to occur during dry heat treatment of freeze-dried coagulation factor concentrates is described. Techniques used to determine moisture content during heating were Loss on Drying and Karl Fischer.

Therefore, a non-invasive, non-destructive method for determination of residual moisture content using near infrared spectrometry(NIR) was developed for freeze-dried <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> (AHF).

40|$|The {{demand for}} blood {{products}} containing factor VIII for treating patients with haemophilia A in south-east Scotland was reviewed. From 1961 to 1975 {{the demand for}} fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate (CP), and <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> (AHF) increased by {{seven and a half}} times, while total donations increased by only a third. Patients with severe haemophilia A treated at the regional haemophilia centre used about 85 % of the factor VIII issued in 1971 - 4, most of which was used on demand. A patient with severe haemophilia A on unlimited ondemand home treatment would need about 500 units of factor VII/kg body weight/year, and a regional haemophilia centre, treating moderate and mild cases as well as severe ones, would use 15000 units/patient/year. Altogether about 50 million units of factor VIII will be needed each year in the UK. Although cryoprecipitate is much harder to store and administer than AHF, its yield from plasma may be far greater and its cost far smaller. Unless the blood transfusion services receive increased amounts of money and reappraise their functions and operation, it seems likely that they will have to rely increasingly on commercial (and costly) sources for the major plasma fractions...|$|R
40|$|Human {{complement}} <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> is {{the crucial}} catalytic {{component of the}} C 3 convertase enzyme that activates the alternative pathway of complement-mediated immunity. Although a serine protease in its own right, <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> circulates in human serum as an inactive zymogen {{and there is a}} crystal structure only for the inactive state of <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> and various fragments. To provide greater insight to the catalytic function and properties of <b>factor</b> <b>B,</b> we have used short para-nitroanilide derivatives of 4 -to 15 -residue peptides as substrates to profile the catalytic properties of <b>factor</b> <b>B.</b> Among <b>factors</b> found to influence catalytic activity of <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> was an unusual dependence on pH. Non-physiological alkaline conditions strongly promoted substrate cleavage by <b>factor</b> <b>B,</b> consistent with a pH-accessible conformation of the enzyme that may be critical for catalytic function. Small N-terminal extensions to conventional hexapeptide para-nitroanilide substrates significantly increased catalytic activity of <b>factor</b> <b>B,</b> which was more selective for its cleavage site than trypsin. The new chromogenic assay enabled optimization of catalysis conditions, the profiling of different substrate sequences, and the development of the first reversible and competitive substrate-based inhibitor of <b>factor</b> <b>B.</b> The inhibitor was also shown to prevent in vitro formation of C 3 a from C 3 by <b>factor</b> <b>B,</b> by synthetic and by natural C 3 convertase of the alternative complement activation pathway, and to block formation of membrane attack complex.

On the other hand, in patients with nephrosis and with MPGN Type II, KAF and <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> levels were low but were directly correlated. In nephrosis the correlation may be the combined result of an equal rate of catabolism of these proteins and of modulation of <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> levels by the level of KAF as in normal subjects. In MPGN Type II, the correlation may reflect the fact, noted in in vitro studies, that with alternative pathway activation, the level of KAF influences the extent of <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> and C 3 conversion to a greater extent than when complement is activated by the classical pathway...|$|R
40|$|AbstractComplement <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> is a 90 kDa protein {{consisting}} of three domains: a three-module complement control protein, a von Willebrand factor A domain, and a C-terminal serine protease (SP) domain that adopts a default inactive (zymogen) conformation. The interaction between <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> and pathogen-bound C 3 b is mediated by its A domain, triggering a conformational change in <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> that ultimately creates the “C 3 convertase” {{of the alternative}} complement pathway. We report the crystal structure of the A domain from <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> and show that it contains an integrin-like MIDAS motif that adopts the “open” conformation typical of integrin-ligand complexes, with an acidic residue (provided by a fortuitous crystal contact) completing the coordination of the metal ion. Modeling studies indicate that the <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> A domain can also adopt the closed conformation, supporting the hypothesis that an “integrin-like switch” is conserved in complement proteins and perhaps in 60 other A domains found within the human proteome...|$|R

In order to define the nature of any complement abnormality in SCA, we investigated the complement system in eighty-seven patients during asymptomatic periods, and analysed <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> turnover in a small sample. In these patients geometric mean serum concentrations of functionally active <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> and <b>factor</b> D, and of C 3 and C 4 protein (expressed as a percentage of normal reference serum) wer lower than in controls (78 % vs 107 %, P less than 0. 001, 86 % vs 103 %, P less than 0. 001, 91 % vs 100 %, P less than 0. 01, 89 % vs 105 %, P less than 0. 05 respectively). The ratio of the serum concentration of functionally active <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> to <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> protein was lower in patients than in controls (means 75 % s. d. 16 % vs mean 93 %, s. d. 22 % P less than 0. 001), indicating a functional deficiency of <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> protein. In addition, the fractional catabolic rate of radiolabelled <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> was markedly increased in four out of seven asymptomatic patients studied, and was inversely related to the functional <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> concentration in serum (r = - 0. 59, P less than 0. 05); <b>factor</b> <b>B</b> synthesis was uniformly increased. Complement activation was not related to the presence of circulating C 1 q binding material. We conclude that complement activation, rather than defective synthesis as previously suggested, contributes to the abnormalities in complement componenet concentration and function in asymptomatic subjects with sickle cell anaemia...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} of the genes coding for HLA to those coding for properdin <b>Factor</b> <b>B</b> allotypes and for deficiency of the second component of complement (C 2) was studied in families of patients with connective tissue disorders. Patients were selected because they were heterozygous or homozygous for C 2 deficiency. 12 families with 15 matings informative for C 2 deficiency were found. Of 57 informative meioses, two crossovers were noted between the C 2 deficiency gene and the HLA-B gene, with a recombinant fraction of 0. 035. A lod score of 13 was calculated for linkage between C 2 deficiency and HLA-B at a maximum likelihood value of the recombinant fraction of 0. 04. 18 families with 21 informative matings for both properdin <b>Factor</b> <b>B</b> allotype and HLA-B were found. Of 72 informative meioses, three recombinants were found, giving a recombinant fraction of 0. 042. A lod score of 16 between HLA-B and <b>Factor</b> <b>B</b> allotypes was calculated at a maximum likelihood value of the recombinant fraction of 0. 04. A crossover was shown to have occurred between genes for <b>Factor</b> <b>B</b> and HLA-D, in which HLA-D segregared with HLA-A and B. These {{studies suggest that the}} genes for <b>Factor</b> <b>B</b> and C 2 deficiency are located outside those for HLA, that the order of genese is HLA-A, -B, -D, <b>Factor</b> <b>B</b> allotype, C 2 deficiency, that the genes coding for C 2 deficiency and <b>Factor</b> <b>B</b> allotypes are approximately 3 [...] 5 centimorgans from the HLA-A and HLA-B loci, and that the apparent lack of recombinants between the <b>Factor</b> <b>B</b> gene and C 2 deficiency gene suggests that these two genes lie in close proximity to one another...|$|R

The {{purpose of the present}} article is to consider the appropriate use of error term as the denominator of the usual F ratio, and the quasi-F ratio when the usual F ratio can not be applied, to test the main effects and the interaction effects, and the appropriate use of the error term as the form of the simple mean square and the composite mean square to test the simple effects in 'three-factor' experimental design with repeated measures on two factors, for example, which are <b>Factor</b> <b>B</b> and <b>Factor</b> C. In such a 'three-factor' experimental design as described above, there are six cases which are described as follows: Case 1 : <b>Factor</b> A, <b>Factor</b> <b>B,</b> and <b>Factor</b> C are all fixed.
