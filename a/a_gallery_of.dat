5|$|Before every battle, {{the player}} {{is given the}} choice of using 'Political Tactics,' such as {{increasing}} or decreasing time limit of battles or preventing enemy reinforcements from arriving during battles. The player can also secure alliances with other forces; these alliances can change how the game progresses, such as requesting reinforcements from the allied forces against opposing forces. However, these alliances only last for a set time decided by the tactic used. There's also an 'Archives Mode' that shows the motions and voices of the officers. <b>A</b> <b>gallery</b> <b>of</b> character artworks and game movies is also presented within the Archives Mode.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps no {{work of art}} so {{imperfect}} ever announced {{such power}} in the artist—perhaps no artist so powerful ever rested his fame on so imperfect a production—as Thalaba. The author calls it a metrical romance; he might have called it a lyrical one; for the story is told, as in an ode, by implication; not directly, as in an epopoeia. It is <b>a</b> <b>gallery</b> <b>of</b> successive pictures. Each is strikingly descriptive... but the personages, like the figures of landscape-painters, are often almost lost in the scene: they appear as the episodical or accessory objects.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the bark}} {{functions}} as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew {{their way through the}} cellulose tissues leaving <b>a</b> <b>gallery</b> <b>of</b> tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were killed by this disease.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the cathedral}} began in about 1175, {{to the design of}} an unknown architect. Wells is the first cathedral in England to be, from its foundation, built in the Gothic style. According to art {{historian}} John Harvey, it is the first truly Gothic cathedral in the world, its architects having entirely dispensed with all the features that bound the contemporary east end of Canterbury Cathedral and the earlier buildings of France, such as the east end of the Abbey of Saint Denis, to the Romanesque. Unlike these churches, Wells has clustered piers rather than columns and has <b>a</b> <b>gallery</b> <b>of</b> identical pointed arches rather than the typically Romanesque form of paired openings. The style, with its simple untraceried lancet arches and convoluted mouldings, is known as Early English Gothic.|$|E

5|$|Little Busters! is {{a romance}} visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of Riki Naoe. Much of its {{gameplay}} is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. The text in the game is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Riki is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which {{take the place of}} the background art and character sprites. When the game is completed at least once, <b>a</b> <b>gallery</b> <b>of</b> the viewed CGs and played background music becomes available on the game's title screen. Little Busters! follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.|$|E
5|$|Tayutama is {{a romance}} visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of Yuri Mito. Its {{gameplay}} mainly consists of reading and progressing through the story's narrative and dialogue. The game's text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Yuri is talking to, appearing on top of background artwork. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which {{take the place of}} the regular background art and character sprites. When the game is completed at least once, <b>a</b> <b>gallery</b> <b>of</b> the viewed CGs and played background music is available on the game's title screen. Tayutama follows a branching plot line with nonlinear sequences and multiple endings, where the plot's direction is affected by the player's decisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{lyrics of}} the Epistles {{describe}} <b>a</b> <b>gallery</b> <b>of</b> fictional and semi-fictional characters who {{take part in}} more or less real events {{in and around the}} Stockholm of Bellman's time. This cast includes some 44 named personages, many of whom appear only once or twice. Some, like the principal characters Jean Fredman and Ulla Winblad, are based on real people, and in Fredman's case his real name was used. The Fredman of the Epistles is an alcoholic former watchmaker, and is the central character and fictional narrator. He is thus supposedly present in all the Epistles, but is only named in a few of them. The backdrop of many of the Epistles, Stockholm's taverns, is also frequented by musicians including Christian Wingmark on flute, Father Berg on various instruments, Father Movitz, and the dance master Corporal Mollberg.|$|E
