40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 The {{climatic effect}} and {{requirements}} of clouds over the Arctic Ocean are examined using {{a pair of}} one-dimensional models. A coupled ice-atmosphere column model with prescribed cloud properties is {{used to examine the}} effect of clouds on the central arctic climate. When forced with boundary conditions representative of the Central Arctic, the model produces a realistic simulation of the seasonal cycle of arctic air temperature, ice thickness, and radiative fluxes. Unlike previous studies, the results suggest that the <b>annual</b> <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> of clouds is to increase ice thickness slightly. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that previous studies have not accounted for the effect of clouds on the atmospheric temperature profile, which is an internally-computed model variable in the present study. The results indicate that the response of sea ice thickness to a perturbation in clouds can be predicted by estimating how the cloud perturbation affects the radiative budget at the top of the atmosphere. The annual cycle of low-cloud amount over the Arctic Ocean is examined using climatological data and a time-dependent atmospheric column model. Three hypotheses for the annual cycle are formulated, compared with climatological data for consistency, and then tested using a numerical model. The model, which includes a turbulence-closure cloud scheme and ice-phase micro-physical processes, simulates the summer and winter cloud regimes when forced with the boundary conditions corresponding to those seasons. Results from the model experiments suggest that the main factor in determining the annual cycle of low cloud amount is the effectiveness of ice processes in eliminating liquid water clouds and preventing the water vapor mixing ratio in clear air from reaching saturation with respect to liquid. It is shown that, among general circulation models participating in the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project, those including ice microphysics produce qualitatively more realistic simulations of the mean annual cycle of cloud amount over the Arctic Ocean than models without atmospheric ice processes. The results suggest that the duration of the summertime cloudy season should be longer when the Arctic Ocean climate is warmer, and shorter when it is cooler...|$|E
40|$|A {{distributed}} {{data and}} simulation system for forested watersheds {{was used to}} investigate the potential changes in watershed hydrological and ecological processes under hypothesized climate change scenarios. RHESSys (Regional HydroEcological Simulation System) incorporates a spatial representation of nested catchment and lake systems in a GIS, along {{with a set of}} process submodels to compute local flux and storage of energy, water, carbon, and nutrients. A hierarchy of potential climate change shifts in weather, forest canopy physiological processes, and forest cover were used to operate RHESSys for comparison with control simulations for present-day conditions. Use of projected temperature and precipitation changes alone led to qualitatively different forecasts of watershed climate change impact when compared to simulations that also incorporated adjustment of canopy physiology to elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO*. In addition, ecosystem processes may be more resilient to climate change due to the existence of a series of offsetting <b>effects.</b> <b>Annual</b> <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> on specific processes such as watershed outflow and forest productivity may qualitatively vary from year to year rather than showing consistent increases or decreases relative to current conditions.

40|$|Large-scale {{deforestation}} {{may affect}} the surface energy budget and consequently climate by changing the physical properties of the land surface, namely biophysical effects. This study presents the potential energy budget change caused by deforestation in Northeastern China and its climate implications, which was evaluated by quantifying the differences in MODIS-observed surface physical properties between cropland and forest. We used the MODIS land products {{for the period of}} 2001 – 2010 in 112 cells of 0. 75 ° × 0. 75 ° each, within which only best quality satellite pixels over the pure forest and cropland pixels are selected for comparison. It is estimated that cropland has a winter (summer) mean albedo of 0. 38 (0. 16), which is 0. 15 (0. 02) higher than that of forest. Due to the higher albedo, cropland absorbs 16. 84 W∙m− 2 (3. 08 W∙m− 2) less shortwave radiation than forest. Compared to forest, cropland also absorbs 8. 79 W∙m− 2 more longwave radiation in winter and 8. 12 W∙m− 2 less longwave radiation in summer. In total, the surface net radiation of cropland is 7. 53 W∙m− 2 (11. 2 W∙m− 2) less than that of forest in winter (summer). Along with these radiation changes, the latent heat flux through evapotranspiration over cropland is less than that over forest, especially in summer (− 19. 12 W∙m− 2). Average sensible heat flux increases in summer (7. 92 W∙m− 2) and decreases in winter (− 8. 17 W∙m− 2), suggesting that conversion of forest to cropland may lead to warming in summer and cooling in winter in Northeastern China. However, the <b>annual</b> <b>net</b> climate <b>effect</b> is not notable because of the opposite sign of the energy budget change in summer and winter...|$|R

40|$|Abstract An {{existing}} {{dynamic and}} stochastic bio-economic model of intramammary infection (IMI) caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Escherichia coli {{was extended to}} model the dynamics of IMI during the dry period. These dynamics were modeled {{on the basis of}} a Greenwood model. The extended model was used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of different dry period interventions in relation to the <b>annual</b> <b>net</b> costs of IMI in a herd of 100 dairy cows at the start. The interventions were blanket dry cow therapy (BDCT) as the default scenario, BDCT combined with teat sealant (TS), selective dry cow therapy (SDCT) or TS, and SDCT combined with TS. Input parameters of the dynamics of IMI during the dry period and the economic parameters were based on literature. The costs of clinical and subclinical IMI during lactation, clinical IMI during the dry period, and the cost of intervention were used to calculate the combined total <b>annual</b> <b>net</b> cost of IMI per herd. The combined total <b>annual</b> <b>net</b> cost of IMI using the other intervention scenarios was compared to the default scenario (BDCT) to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the other intervention scenarios. Sensitivity analysis was conducted on the parameters involved. The results showed that a considerable number of cows acquire new IMI during the dry period and start the new lactation with IMI. Furthermore, the average combined total <b>annual</b> <b>net</b> cost of IMI per herd using BDCT was € 8800, distributed as € 4561 due to clinical IMI, and € 3063 due to subclinical IMI during lactation, € 88 due to clinical IMI during the dry period, and € 1088 due to antibiotic therapy and labor costs at dry off. On average, application of BDCT combined with TS resulted in € 378 higher combined total <b>annual</b> <b>net</b> cost of IMI compared to the BDCT scenario. Similarly, the SDCT scenarios resulted in higher average combined total <b>annual</b> <b>net</b> costs of IMI compared to the BDCT scenario. The SDCT or TS was on average € 443 higher and the SDCT combined with TS was on average € 635 higher. Sensitivity analysis results showed that the rate of new IMI during the dry period was the most influential parameter on the average combined total <b>annual</b> <b>net</b> cost of IMI. Although the difference between the 4 simulated scenarios was minor, on average BDCT had the lowest combined total <b>annual</b> <b>net</b> cost of IMI...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTwo new therapies for fecal {{incontinence}} (FI) are now available: non–animal stabilized hyaluronic acid and dextranomer copolymer (NASHA/Dx) and sacral nerve stimulation (SNS). PurposeThis study aimed {{to determine the}} cost-effectiveness of NASHA/Dx compared with SNS and conservative therapy (CT) {{for the treatment of}} FI after CT failure. MethodsDecision tree models with Markov subbranches were developed to compare all direct costs and outcomes during a 3 -year period from the viewpoint of the US third-party payer. Costs (in 2013 US dollars) of devices, medical and surgical care, and hospitalization were included. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incontinence-free days (IFDs). Both costs and outcomes were discounted {{at an annual rate of}} 3 %. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for each outcome. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to examine robustness of results and model stability. A budget impact analysis was also undertaken to estimate the potential cost and savings of NASHA/Dx for a payer with 1, 000, 000 covered lives. ResultsFor the 3 -year cost-effectiveness models, the expected cost was $ 9053 for CT, $ 14, 962 for NASHA/Dx, and $ 33, 201 for SNS. The numbers of QALYs were 1. 769, 1. 929, and 2. 004, respectively. The numbers of IFDs were 128. 8, 267. 6, and 514. 8, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per additional IFD gained were $ 42. 60 for NASHA/Dx vs CT, $ 73. 76 for SNS vs NASHA/Dx, and $ 62. 55 for SNS vs CT. The incremental costs per QALY gained were $ 37, 036 for NASHA/Dx vs CT, $ 244, 509 for SNS vs NASHA/Dx, and $ 103, 066 for SNS vs CT. The budget impact analysis evaluated the financial effect on the health care system of the use of NASHA/Dx and SNS. For the scenarios evaluated, when all of the patients receive NASHA/Dx, the <b>net</b> <b>annual</b> <b>effect</b> to the health care payer budget ranged from $ 571, 455 to $ 2, 857, 275. When all of the patients receive SNS, the <b>net</b> <b>annual</b> <b>effect</b> to the health care payer budget ranged from $ 1, 959, 323 to $ 9, 796, 613. ConclusionBoth NASHA/Dx and SNS have produced significant improvements in FI symptoms for affected patients. NASHA/Dx is a cost-effective and more efficient use of resources for the treatment of FI when compared with SNS. The budget impact analysis suggests that although reimbursement for NASHA/Dx treatment initially adds costs to the health care system, it is significantly less expensive than SNS for patients who are candidates for either treatment...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{different}} sky conditions on diffuse PAR fraction (ϕ), air temperature (Ta), vapor pressure deficit (vpd) and GPP in a deciduous forest is investigated using eddy covariance observations of CO 2 fluxes and radiometer and ceilometer observations of sky and PAR conditions on hourly and growing season timescales. Maximum GPP response occurred under moderate to high PAR and ϕ and low vpd. Light response models using a rectangular hyperbola showed a positive linear relation between ϕ and effective quantum efficiency (α = 0. 023 ϕ + 0. 012, r 2 = 0. 994). Since PAR and ϕ are negatively correlated, {{there is a}} tradeoff between the greater use efficiency of diffuse light and lower vpd and the associated decrease in total PAR available for photosynthesis. To a lesser extent, light response was also modified by vpd and Ta. The <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> of these and their relation with sky conditions helped enhance light response under sky conditions that produced higher ϕ. Six sky conditions were classified from cloud frequency and ϕ data: optically thick clouds, optically thin clouds, mixed sky (partial clouds within hour), high, medium and low optical aerosol. The frequency and light responses of each sky condition for the growing season were used to predict the role of changing sky conditions on <b>annual</b> GPP. The <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> of increasing frequency of thick clouds is to decrease GPP, changing low aerosol conditions has negligible effect. Increases in the other sky conditions all lead to gains in GPP. Sky conditions that enhance intermediate levels of ϕ, such as thin or scattered clouds or higher aerosol concentrations from volcanic eruptions or anthropogenic emissions, will have a positive outcome on annual GPP, while an increase in cloud cover will have a negative impact. Due to the ϕ/PAR tradeoff and since GPP response to changes in individual sky conditions differ in sign and magnitude, the net response of ecosystem GPP to future sky conditions is non-linear and tends toward moderation of change...|$|R
