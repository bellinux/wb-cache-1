50|$|To date, {{more than}} 33,000 {{international}} transport operators had been authorised (by their respective competent national authorities) {{to access the}} TIR system, using around 1.5 million <b>TIR</b> <b>carnets</b> per year.|$|R
50|$|Truckers {{making use}} of the TIR {{procedure}} must first obtain an internationally harmonised customs document, {{referred to as a}} <b>TIR</b> <b>carnet.</b> <b>TIR</b> <b>carnets</b> are issued by national road transport associations. This customs document is valid internationally and as well as describing the goods, their shipper and their destination, represents a financial guarantee. When a truck arrives at a border customs post it need not pay import duties and taxes on goods at that time. Instead the payments are suspended. If the vehicle transits the country without delivering any goods, no taxes are due. If it fails to leave the country with all the goods, then the taxes are billed to the importer and the financial guarantee backstops the importer's obligation to pay the taxes. TIR transits are carried out in bond, i.e. the lorry must be sealed as well as bearing the carnet. The security payment system is administered by the International Road Transport Union (IRU).|$|R
40|$|Master's {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} {{to one of the}} most effective international treaties, which attends to facilitating and liberalization of international handling with goods, functioning for almost 40 years. This paper mainly describes the situation, which appeared in 2013, when the barriers for its application emerged. It tells about the crisis of <b>TIR</b> <b>Carnet</b> on the Russian territory, caused by some intern factors as well as factors on the international level. Affairs and changes, arisen in the beginning of the 21 st century (expanding of the EU, new goods transportation methods, Customs Union, etc.) drove to the loss of TIR treaty's significance, and to the necessity of creating new international cooperation principles. Situation then changed due to the civil war in Ukraine, sanctions against Russia and Russian response. That is why the ground, reasons and consequences of <b>TIR</b> <b>Carnet</b> crisis on the Russian territory were in detail described in the master's thesis. Main conclusion is that this crisis only predicts the beginning of serious changes in international transport of goods, which can be faced in the nearest future...|$|R
5000|$|The Convention on International Transport of Goods Under Cover of <b>TIR</b> <b>Carnets</b> (<b>TIR</b> Convention) is a {{multilateral}} treaty that was concluded at Geneva on 14 November 1975 to simplify and harmonise the administrative formalities of international road transport. (TIR stands for [...] "Transports Internationaux Routiers" [...] or [...] "International Road Transports".) The 1975 convention replaced the TIR Convention of 1959, which itself replaced the 1949 TIR Agreement between {{a number of}} European countries. The conventions were adopted {{under the auspices of}} the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). As of June 2017, there are 71 parties to the Convention, including 70 states and the European Union.|$|R
40|$|In my diploma thesis I {{focus on}} use of <b>carnet</b> <b>TIR</b> within {{international}} road freight transport to Russian Federation. The objective of the thesis is to introduce crisis connected with partial non-acceptance of <b>carnet</b> <b>TIR</b> in Russia and analyze {{the impact of this}} crisis to economy and forwarders. The second objective is to introduce Ukraine crisis, which also had an impact to forwarders. Finally, I will introduce a forwarder, who transports goods to Russia regularly and describe the impact of crisis on him...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} thesis was {{to characterize}} the present conditions of enterprising in international transportation of goods and to provide realistic perspective in the very business. My intention was to introduce more concretely the basic obligations required when establishing an enterprise and consequently specify {{the conditions of the}} successful operating. In the first, methodological part I focused {{on the issue of the}} foundation of a business which operates in international transport. Here I summarized the exact requirements, necessary transportation permits and the international agreements which determine the duties of the carriers. Further I referred to the obligations and authorities of state agencies in international transportation. The second part deals with the operation of the company called ROAD MASTERS. In this section I mostly focused on the attributes of occupying workers. The last part emphasizes the differences between the western and eastern requirements for carriers. Here I analyzed the assignments of the union called ČESMAD SLOVAKIA and further conditions of transporting to the Russian federation, namely the <b>TIR</b> <b>carnet</b> and visas...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{summarize}} and systematically describe the overall conditions of the international ground freight services. In the introduction there is a brief characteristic of the current situation at the area of international trade {{with respect to the}} international freight services. In the second part there are mentioned and briefly described the related multilateral contracts (Convention on International Transport of Goods Under Cover of <b>TIR</b> <b>Carnets,</b> European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road ADR, Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs and on the Special Equipment to be Used for such Carriage ATP and European Agreement concerning the Work of Crews of Vehicles engaged in International Road Transport AETR). The main accent is put on the Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (CMR), which was negotiated by the contracting parties in Geneva, 19 May 1956 and which is the most important and comprehensive document in this branch of law. There is also mentioned the national law as a supportive source of law to be used for cases which are not covered by the CMR Convention as well as the Incoterms rules which are standard trade definitions most commonly used in international sales contracts. The third part analyzes the regulations with respect to the Czech Republic. It gives more details about the CMR Convention and its regulation of rights and liabilities of the contracting parties of the contract for the international carriage of goods by road and regulation of related documents. There are mentioned articles and provision of "Zákon o mezinárodním právu soukromém a procesním and Obchodní zákoník", which are applicable in the area of international carriage of goods and there is also referred to how the Incoterms influence logistics. The fourth part briefly describes other contract known by the Czech law and compares them with each other. There is also mentioned the current situation on the field of logistics and usage of individual contracts among the carriers and related contracting parties. The fifth part gives a brief overview of logistics from the international trade perspective. In conclusion there is a recapitulation of the above mentioned sources of law for the logistic area and it is stressed out, how important it is for the contracting parties of the contract for the international carriage of goods by road, mainly for the carrier, to be familiar with the regulations and to take account of them when negotiating the contract and choosing and training his employees...|$|R

40|$|A {{new design}} for a {{photovoltaic}} concentrator, the most recent advance based on the Kohler concept, is presented. The system is mirror-based, and with geometry that guaranties a maximum sunlight collection area (without shadows, like those caused by secondary stages or receivers and heat-sinks in other mirror-based systems). Designed for a concentration of 1000 x, this off axis system combines both good acceptance angle and good irradiance uniformity on the solar cell. The advanced performance features (concentration-acceptance products ?CAP- about 0. 73 and affordable peak and average irradiances) are achieved through the combination of four reflective folds combined with four refractive surfaces, all of them free-form, performing Köhler integration 2. In Köhler devices, the irradiance uniformity is not achieved through <b>additional</b> optical stages (<b>TIR</b> prisms), thus no complex/expensive elements to manufacture are required. The rim angle and geometry are such that the secondary stage and receivers are hidden below the primary mirrors, so maximum collection is assured. The entire system was designed to allow loose assembly/alignment tolerances (through high acceptance angle) and to be manufactured using already well-developed methods for mass production, with high potential for low cost. The optical surfaces for Köhler integration, although with a quite different optical behavior, have approximately the same dimensions and can be manufactured with the same techniques as the more traditional secondary optical elements used for concentration (typically plastic injection molding or glass molding) ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, the {{innate immune system}} {{has been the subject}} of {{extensive}} research. Often overlooked by the robustness and specificity of the adaptive immune system, the innate immune system is proving to be just as complex. The identification of several families of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) has revealed an ancient yet multifaceted system of proteins that are responsible for initiating host defense. A wide array of pathogens, from virus to bacteria, is detected using this assortment of receptors. One such family, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), has been at the forefront of this research. To date, 10 TLRs have been described in the human genome. Activation of TLRs leads to the induction of immune-related genes that ultimately control the response of the host. However, the signaling pathways emanating from activated TLRs and other PRRs are not fully understood. In particular, the pathway leading to the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF 3), a transcription factor crucial for the induction of type I interferon, remains undefined. IRF 3 activation occurs as the consequence of viral infection and through the activation of TLRs 3 and 4 by dsRNA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively. The focus of this research is to describe components of the IRF 3 activation pathway, partly through the analysis of TLR signal transduction. IRF 3 normally resides in the cytoplasm of cells. Upon infection with certain viruses and bacteria, IRF 3 is activated though phosphorylation at its C-terminus. Phosphorylated IRF 3 homodimerizes and associates with co-activators CBP-p 300. After translocating to the nucleus, the activate IRF 3 complex induces the activation of type 1 interferon and interferon related genes. Little is known about the pathways that lead to the activation of IRF 3, especially the kinases involved. In this study we report that the non-canonical IкB kinase homologues, IкB kinase epsilon (IKKε) and TANK-binding kinase- 1 (TBK 1), which were previously implicated in NF-кB activation, are also essential components of the IRF 3 signaling pathway. In particular, mouse embryonic fibroblasts from TBK 1 deficient mice fail to activate IRF 3 in response to both viral infection and stimulation with LPS or poly (IC), a dsRNA analog. Thus, both IKKε and TBK 1 play a critical role in innate immunity and host defense. In addition to viral infection, IRF 3 activation also occurs via the activation of TLR 3 and 4. TLRs signal through a subfamily of Toll-IL- 1 -Resistance (TIR) domain containing adapter molecules. One such adapter, MyD 88, is crucial for all TLRs, with the exception of TLR 3. MyD 88 participates in a signal transduction pathway culminating in the activation of the transcription factor NF-кB. Studies from MyD 88 -deficient mice reveal that both TLR 3 and 4 still are capable of activating NF-кB, although with slightly delayed kinetics. Another aspect of the MyD 88 -independent signal transduction pathway is the activation of IRF 3. A second TIR domain containing adapter molecule called Mal/Tirap was discovered and originally thought to mediate the MyD 88 -independent pathway. However, Mal-deficient mice were found to be defective in both TLR 2 and 4 mediated NF-кB activation. We hypothesized that other TIR domain containing adapters could mediate this MyD 88 -independent pathway of TLR 3 and 4 leading to the activation of IRF 3. Two <b>additional</b> <b>TIR</b> adapters were discovered, TRIF and TRAM. TRIF was shown to mediate TLR 3 signal transduction. In this study, we report that both TRIF and TRAM mediate the activation of the MyD 88 -independent pathway in response to LPS/TLR 4 activation. Unlike any of the other known TIR domain containing adapters, TRAM appears to be restricted to the LPS/TLR 4 activation pathway while TRIF plays a role in both TLR 3 and TLR 4 pathways leading to IRF 3 target gene expression. Our studies revealed that TRAM could be acting upstream of TRIF in the LPS/TLR 4 pathway. To this end, we sought to determine the localization of TRAM within the cell. We found that TRAM localizes to the plasma membrane. TRAM localization is the result of myristoylation since mutation of the predicted myristoylation site (G 2 A) resulted in the re-distribution of TRAM from the membrane into the cytoplasm. Reconstitution of TRAM-deficient macrophages with TRAM G 2 A is unable to rescue LPS/TLR 4 signal transduction. Thus, myristoylation and membrane association of TRAM are critical for LPS/TLR 4 signal transduction. The data generated in this dissertation extends our understanding of the signaling pathways of the innate immune system. Indeed, the molecules and pathways described herein could prove to be beneficial targets for ameliorating symptoms of disease, both autoimmune and pathogen-associated. Finally, the research described here will spur further insight into the complex signaling pathways of a once ignored arm of the immune system...|$|R
40|$|The Diploma {{thesis is}} focused on Community customs union and {{relations}} with third countries, regarding particularly customs procedure during foreign transit operations. It is aimed to summarize basic knowledge regarding TIR system operation with emphasis on its current development and modernization. At present, TIR regime is experiencing a very dynamic progress, and it is related both to its computerization {{and changes in the}} European Union, which tends to enhance safety standards on the international level when shipping the goods. Therefore, the means of communication are improved by the interconnection of main actors engaged in business transactions, such as national customs authorities and associations, traders and international organisations. The first part of the thesis deals with customs union and common trade policy of European Union. It defines the term of customs union and European customs union territory, specifies both internal and external aspects of customs union existence, and shortly describes the process of European customs union creation. The two following chapters are concerned with the customs administration, legislation and basic documentation forming customs legislation of European Union. The fourth chapter describes the development and customs union improvement with its new strategy and modernized customs union codex. The second part concentrates on the analysis of customs procedure in general and international customs regimes. It describes the basic terms used in customs administration, specifies the ways of customs debt calculation and factors which may lead to the customs debt. The closing chapter is devoted to transit regimes functioning not only on the territory of the European Union, but in third countries as well. The third part addresses the TIR transit regime. At the beginning, the foundation and historical development of the regime is described, followed by its mission, principles and territorial scope. In the next chapter the basic conditions of membership are identified. The following chapter is reserved for description and explanation of international guarantee system, mutual relations of its participants and forms of guarantee provision. In the last chapter the <b>carnet</b> <b>TIR</b> - main document used for customs purposes when shipping - is highlighted. The last chapter {{is focused on}} TIR system computerization, its innovation and improvement, and development mainly in recent years. The forth part of the thesis emphasizes membership advantages, particularly benefits of TIR system, and outlines the fields of the European Union and TIR system cooperation. The conclusion then summarizes important parts and key elements of the paper. When putting together the thesis, the latest available data on the TIR system progress regarding cooperation with the European Union were used, as the main aim of the thesis was to provide detailed information on the current situation and modernization of TIR regime...|$|R
