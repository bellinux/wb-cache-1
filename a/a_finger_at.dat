5|$|Some players {{remained}} {{resentful of}} Craig's dubious elevation ahead of Harvey during the 1957–58 tour of South Africa but appreciated {{that he had}} not promoted himself and that he was fair and open to input from teammates. On the tour, Harvey broke <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> catching practice and missed the early tour matches. After it healed, Harvey returned for a match against a South African XI, in a virtual dress rehearsal for the Tests. He scored 173 as the tourists crushed their hosts by an innings.|$|E
25|$|Gesture {{recognition}} enables {{humans to}} communicate with the machine (HMI) and interact naturally without any mechanical devices. Using the concept of gesture recognition, it is possible to point <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the computer screen so that the cursor will move accordingly. This could make conventional input devices such as mouse, keyboards and even touch-screens redundant.|$|E
25|$|David Harland, {{the former}} head of UN Civil Affairs in Bosnia, claimed at the trial of General Dragomir Milošević in ICTY, that he was {{responsible}} for the creation of the myth that UNPROFOR was unable to determine who had fired the mortar shells that caused the second Markale massacre. The myth that has survived for more than ten years, Harland said, was created because of a “neutral statement” made by General Rupert Smith, the UNPROFOR commander. On the day of the second Markale attack, General Smith stated “it is unclear who fired the shells, although at that time he already had the technical report of UNPROFOR intelligence section, determining beyond reasonable doubt that they were fired from VRS positions at Lukavica”. Harland himself had advised General Smith to make “a neutral statement in order not to alarm the Serbs who would be alerted to the impending NATO air strikes against their positions had he pointed <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> them”, which would have jeopardized the safety of UN troops in the territory under VRS control or on positions where they might have been vulnerable to retaliatory attacks by Serb forces.|$|E

500|$|In a July 1987 {{review of}} 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?), Q {{magazine}} recalled {{that the original}} release of [...] "All You Need Is Love" [...] "seemed an inspired moment of pure wildness. Here were Red Clydeside beatbox rappers pointing <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> society, putting their record together from samples pirated directly from other people's recordings, {{while at the same}} time crossing almost all contemporary music tribal boundaries by including everyone from Samantha Fox to The MC5 among their victims." [...] This was contrasted with 1987 which the reviewer felt was a [...] "disappointment" [...] with [...] "too few ideas being spread too thin".|$|E
500|$|Smith was {{credited}} with creating or popularizing the following basketball techniques: The [...] "tired signal," [...] in which a player would use a hand signal (originally a raised fist) to indicate {{that he needed to}} come out for a rest, huddling at the free throw line before a foul shot, encouraging players who scored a basket to point <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the teammate who passed them the ball, in honor of the passer's selflessness, instituting a variety of defensive sets in one game, having the point guard call out the defense set for the team, and creating a number of defensive sets, including the point zone, the run-and-jump, and double-teaming the screen-and-roll.|$|E
500|$|Levels were {{designed}} {{based on a}} Deluxe Paint interface, which allowed several of the members to design levels, resulting in [...] "hundreds of levels". There were several internal iterations of the levels, each designer challenging the others. Dailly pointed out that David Jones [...] "used to try and beat us, and after proudly stabbing <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the screen and saying 'There! Beat that!', we'd calmly point out a totally new way of getting around all his traps, and {{doing it in a}} much simpler method. 'Oh...', he'd mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it." [...] They also sent internally tested levels to Psygnosis, getting back the results of their testing via fax. While most were solved quickly, Dailly commented that [...] "Every now and again though, the fax would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed out again and again; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels, and it gave us all a warm fuzzy feeling inside." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{their time}} in Jacksonville, the McCains' {{marriage}} began to falter. [...] McCain had extramarital affairs; he was seen with other women in social settings and developed a reputation among his colleagues for womanizing. [...] Some of McCain's activity with other women occurred when he was off-duty after routine flights to Marine Corps Air Station Yuma and Naval Air Facility El Centro. [...] McCain later said, [...] "My marriage's collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity more {{than it was to}} Vietnam, and I cannot escape blame by pointing <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the war. The blame was entirely mine." [...] His wife Carol later stated that the failure was not due to her accident or Vietnam and that [...] "I attribute [...] more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than I do to anything else." [...] John McCain's biographer, Robert Timberg, believes that [...] "Vietnam did play a part, perhaps not the major part, but more than a walk-on." [...] According to John McCain, [...] "I had changed, she had changed. People who have been apart that much change." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{responsibility}} {{principle is}} that a clear conscience results when people {{realize that they are}} responsible to God for every thought, word, action, and motive. Part of this principle is asking forgiveness from whomever has been offended so that no one can point <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> you and say, [...] "You've offended me and never asked for my forgiveness." ...|$|E
2500|$|National Review editor Rich Lowry {{says that}} [...] "Carter always {{finds a way}} to point <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> Israel." [...] Yes, there are two sides to every dispute, and heaven knows the Palestinian people have {{suffered}} throughout the past six decades, but Carter apes the Palestinian position and calls it evenhandedness. Lowry feels the [...] "book marks Carter's further disgraceful descent from ineffectual president and international do-gooder to apologist for the worst Arab tendencies", citing a passage from the book. Mona Charen writes in the National Review that [...] "awkward phrasing is found throughout this slapdash work."Charen presents examples of what she regards as [...] "simplistic, naïve, or tendentious" [...] ideas in the book about the Six-Day War, Hezbollah, and Oslo Accords.|$|E

2500|$|The {{friendship}} between Karna and Duryodhana {{is considered to}} be a great one, and is used as an example of friendship and loyalty. In the epic, Duryodhana decries the means of discrimination employed by Dronacharya. He goes one step further to accord Karna a place among the royals, by crowning him the King of Anga and standing by him whenever anyone pointed <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> his lower-birth. He seems to not care about the low birth of Karna and is the only one to vocally support Karna candidature in the archery contest without caring about caste inequality. When Draupadi refuses to allow Karna to string the bow at her Swayamvara because of his low birth, Duryodhana defends him saying [...] "great sages, philosophers, and warriors have no source. They are made great, not born great". In modern light, his disrespect for discrimination and blind following of tradition is seen more positively.|$|E
2500|$|John McCain {{would later}} say, [...] "My marriage's {{collapse}} was attributable {{to my own}} selfishness and immaturity more {{than it was to}} Vietnam, and I cannot escape blame by pointing <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the war. The blame was entirely mine." [...] Carol McCain later said, [...] "The breakup of our marriage was not caused by my accident or Vietnam or any of those things. I don't know that it might not have happened if John had never been gone. I attribute it more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than I do to anything else." [...] McCain's biographer Robert Timberg believes that [...] "Vietnam did play a part, perhaps not the major part, but more than a walk-on." [...] According to Carol, her husband's five-year captivity in Vietnam had left him wanting to [...] "make up for lost time", and John put it this way: [...] "I had changed, she had changed ... People who have been apart that much change." [...] Ross Perot later said, [...] "After he came home, he walked with a limp, she [...] walked with a limp. So he threw her over for a poster girl with big money from Arizona [...] and the rest is history." ...|$|E
