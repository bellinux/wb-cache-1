As part of the reforms proposed in the 2003 Defence White Paper, Delivering Security in <b>a</b> <b>Changing</b> <b>World,</b> the regiment was merged with the Cheshire Regiment and the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment to form the Mercian Regiment. The amalgamation took place on 1 September 2007 when the Staffordshire Regiment became the 3rd Battalion, the Mercian Regiment. Subsequently, in 2014, The Mercian Regiment reduced its number of regular battalions from three to two, with the 3rd Battalion being disbanded and the personnel being redeployed into the 1st and 2nd Battalions.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1957 Defence Review, the {{structure}} of the Army has consistently shrunk.

Since 1990, reductions have been almost constant, through succeeding defence reviews: Options for Change (1990), Front Line First (1994), the Strategic Defence Review of 1998, Delivering Security in <b>a</b> <b>Changing</b> <b>World</b> (2003), and the Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010.

In April 2009, it was announced that the Tornado F3 force would be reduced to one squadron of 12 aircraft in September 2009.

25|$|Following {{the victory}} of the Battle of Tsushima, Japan's {{erstwhile}} British ally presented a lock of Admiral Nelson's hair to the Imperial Japanese Navy, judging its performance then as on a par with Britain's victory at Trafalgar in 1805. It is still on display at Kyouiku Sankoukan, a public museum maintained by the Japan Self-Defense Force. Nevertheless, there was a consequent change in British strategic thinking, resulting in enlargement of its naval docks at Auckland, New Zealand; Bombay, British India; Fremantle and Sydney, Australia; Simon's Town, Cape Colony; Singapore and British Hong Kong. The naval war confirmed the direction of the British Admiralty's thinking in tactical terms even as it undermined its strategic grasp of <b>a</b> <b>changing</b> <b>world.</b> Tactical orthodoxy, for example, assumed that a naval battle would imitate the conditions of stationary combat and that ships would engage in one long line sailing on parallel courses; but more flexible tactical thinking would now be required as a firing ship and its target maneuvered independently.|$|E
25|$|The 1990s saw {{blockade}} {{operations against}} Bosnia {{and involvement in}} the Kosovo War. The Strategic Defence Review of 1998 and the follow-on Delivering Security in <b>a</b> <b>Changing</b> <b>World</b> White Paper of 2004 promises a somewhat brighter long-term future for the Navy, putting in place the largest naval procurement programme {{since the end of}} the Second World War in order to enhance and rebuild the fleet, with a view to bringing the Navy's capabilities into the 21st century, and restructuring the fleet from a North Atlantic-based, large Anti-Submarine force into a true blue water navy once more. Whilst several smaller vessels were to be withdrawn from service, it was confirmed that two new large aircraft carriers would be constructed. The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) assumed that the highest tasking levels placed on the Navy would be either one full scale operation or two concurrent Medium scale operations, based on these assumptions it recommended that the following fleet levels were required. In the past decade the UK government view has moved away from the recommendations of the SDR, this is usually explained by the changing perceived threat following 9/11 and 7/7, fleet levels are now significantly lower than the SDR recommended.|$|E

500|$|Sierra Leone {{convinced}} Blair and his Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon of {{the need}} to alter the focus of British defence policy towards less conventional conflicts and away from more traditional wars between states. The MoD published a white paper in 2003, Delivering Security in <b>a</b> <b>Changing</b> <b>World,</b> which revisited aspects of the 1998 [...] "Strategic Defence Review" [...] (SDR). The SDR had focused on the Middle East and North Africa, and had not envisaged a need to deploy troops to sub-Saharan Africa other than for a potential non-combatant evacuation operation in Zimbabwe. Thus, the white paper recommended preparations for relatively short, intense operations against forces with inferior technology, with a particular focus on Africa.|$|E
500|$|... "A Song for Simeon" [...] is not {{considered}} by scholars and critics {{to be one of}} Eliot's significant poems. It is thus overshadowed by his comparatively better known works of the period—"The Hollow Men" [...] (1925), written before his conversion; and [...] "The Journey of the Magi" [...] (1927), [...] "Ash Wednesday" [...] (1930), and the later, more substantial Four Quartets (1943), written after his conversion. However, in [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] and these poems, Eliot continues the progression of his themes of alienation in <b>a</b> <b>changing</b> <b>world,</b> and fuses with this the tenets of his newfound faith. Scofield states that the imagery of [...] "A Song for Simeon"—including the symbol of a feather, its setting amid Roman hyacinths and the winter sun—conveys [...] "a sense of wonder and fragile new life". Robin Griffith-Jones draws a connection between Eliot's image of the feather to a statement by Hildegard of Bingen comparing herself [...] "to 'a feather which lacks all weight and strength and flies through the wind'; so she was borne up by God. But Eliot's speaker, still waiting for the wind to blow, imagines only the death wind that will bear him away".|$|E

500|$|Annie Fanny is the feature's lead character. Like {{other young}} women in Playboy pictorials, Annie is beautiful, buxom, and often unclothed. She is sexually innocent, {{oblivious}} to the worldliness around her. Like her forebear Goodman Beaver, Annie was conceived as a modern Candide, above the story's corruptions and temptations. Unlike Goodman, however, Annie is never shocked or offended; she remains blithe. The authors of Icons of the American Comic Book say Annie [...] "glides through <b>a</b> <b>changing</b> <b>world</b> with an untiring optimism" [...] with a [...] "good-natured lack of desire". She is insulated from the carnal nature of those around her, who explain the new rules of society to her each episode. Ruthie, Annie's mother hen roommate, appears in the first episode and remains in the strip throughout its run. Wanda Homefree, Annie Fanny's wild and shapely best friend, first appears in an episode-10 beauty contest as Miss Greenwich Village and is often seen at Annie's side throughout {{the remainder of the}} series. Ralphie Towzer, Annie's nerdy-but-hip do-gooder boyfriend, has the look of Goodman Beaver (with playwright Arthur Miller's eyeglasses and pipe) and the temperament of a straight-laced, chastising prude. Solly Brass, Annie's huckster agent, is based on actor Phil Silvers.|$|E
500|$|The novelist Evelyn Waugh {{had been}} {{familiar}} with the Diary since his childhood. It was a great favourite of his parents—Arthur Waugh used to read passages aloud to his family, and Evelyn's biographer Selena Hastings has drawn attention to the distinctly Pooterish elements in the Waugh household. Evelyn Waugh was initially contemptuous of the book, but grew to admire it, {{to the extent of}} writing in his 1930 essay [...] "One Way to Immortality" [...] that it was [...] "the funniest book in the world". He added: [...] "Nobody wants to read other people's reflections on life and religion and politics, but the routine of their day, properly recorded, is always interesting, and will become more so as conditions change with the years". [...] Morton posits that several of the leading characters in Waugh's early novels, though socially far removed from the Pooters, share the bafflement of Charles and Carrie with the problems of <b>a</b> <b>changing</b> <b>world.</b> In his 1945 novel Brideshead Revisited, Waugh has Lady Marchmain comforting her family by reading aloud from the Diary [...] "with her beautiful voice and great humour of expression". Morton suggests that one of the work's attractions to Waugh was his personal identification with Lupin, {{and the way in which}} the disapproved son (as Waugh saw himself) repeatedly manages to turn adverse circumstances to his ultimate advantage.|$|E
