25|$|However, Khánh {{received}} little assistance from Minh, who resented his deposal by a younger officer whom he {{viewed as an}} unscrupulous upstart.

Khánh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged plot as long as he could, and then claimed that French agents were attempting to assassinate him and implement neutralism. Khánh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> <b>man</b> US$1,300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. U.S. intelligence officials in Vietnam found the story spurious.|$|E
