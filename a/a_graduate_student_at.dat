He also delved into fiction writing, having developed a fascination for it as <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> the University of Arkansas. His first published work was the short story collection Between Here and the Yellow Sea, released in 2006.

5|$|In 1932, as <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> Chicago, he {{discovered}} physics there {{and had the}} rare opportunity to use the equipment of legendary physicist Albert A.

Alvarez also constructed an apparatus of Geiger counter tubes arranged as a cosmic ray telescope, and {{under the aegis of}} his faculty advisor Arthur Compton, conducted an experiment in Mexico City to measure the so-called East–West effect of cosmic rays. Observing more incoming radiation from the west, Alvarez concluded that primary cosmic rays were positively charged. Compton submitted the resulting paper to the Physical Review, with Alvarez's name at the top.|$|E

After completing his PhD, Engelbart stayed on at Berkeley as an assistant professor to teach for a year, and left when it was clear he could not pursue his vision there. Engelbart then formed a startup company, Digital Techniques, Inc., to commercialize some of his doctorate research on storage devices, but after a year decided instead to pursue the research he had been dreaming of since 1951.|$|E

5|$|Rubin was {{inspired}} to pursue an undergraduate education at the currently all-women's school, Vassar College, because Maria Mitchell had been a professor there. She also ignored advice she had received from a high school science teacher to avoid a scientific career and become an artist. She earned her bachelor's degree in astronomy in 1948, the only graduate in astronomy that year. She attempted to enroll in a graduate program at Princeton, but was barred due to her gender. Princeton would not accept women as astronomy graduate students for 27 more years. Rubin also turned down an offer from Harvard University due to her husband, Robert Rubin's, position as <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> Cornell University.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the U.S. Department of the Army {{contracted}} the botanist and bioethicist Arthur Galston, {{who discovered the}} defoliants later used in Agent Orange, and his employer University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana to {{study the effects of}} 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T on cereal grains (including rice) and broadleaf crops. Galston, then <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> the University of Illinois, in his research and 1943 Ph.D. dissertation focused on finding a chemical means to make soybeans flower and fruit earlier. He discovered both that 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) would speed up the flowering of soybeans and that in higher concentrations it would defoliate the soybeans. From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply. In early 1945, the U.S. Army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the Bushnell Army Airfield in Florida. As a result, the U.S. began a full-scale production of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and would have used it against Japan in 1946 during Operation Downfall if the war had continued.|$|E
5|$|Tatlock {{broke up}} with Oppenheimer in 1939, after a tempestuous relationship. In August that year he met Katherine ("Kitty") Puening Harrison, a radical Berkeley student and former Communist Party member. Harrison had been married three times previously. Her first {{marriage}} lasted only a few months. Her second husband was Joe Dallet, {{an active member of}} the Communist party, who was killed in the Spanish Civil War. Kitty returned to the United States where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in botany from the University of Pennsylvania. There she married Richard Harrison, a physician and medical researcher, in 1938. In June 1939 Kitty and Harrison moved to Pasadena, California, where he became chief of radiology at a local hospital and she enrolled as <b>a</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>at</b> the University of California, Los Angeles. Oppenheimer and Kitty created a minor scandal by sleeping together after one of Tolman's parties. In the summer of 1940 she stayed with Oppenheimer at his ranch in New Mexico. She finally asked Harrison for a divorce when she found out she was pregnant. When he refused, she obtained an instant divorce in Reno, Nevada, and took Oppenheimer as her fourth husband on November 1, 1940.|$|E
