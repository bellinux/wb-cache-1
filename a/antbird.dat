5|$|Antbirds {{are common}} {{components}} of the avifauna of {{some parts of the}} Neotropics and are thought to be important in some ecological processes. They are preyed upon by birds of prey, and their tendency to join flocks is thought to provide protection against such predation. The greater round-eared bat preys on some <b>antbird</b> species, such as the white-bibbed <b>antbird</b> and the scaled antbird; the latter is the bat's preferred prey. Nests, including incubating adults, chicks and eggs, are vulnerable to predators, particularly snakes but also nocturnal mammals. Nesting success is low for many species, particularly in areas of fragmented habitat.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds are {{a family}} of Passerines found from Argentina north to Mexico. There are {{a great variety of}} antbirds, with antbirds, antwrens and antshrikes. Antshrikes are small, often handsomely marked birds. There is only one species of <b>antbird</b> {{recorded}} in the United States; an audio recording of a barred antshrike from Harlingen, Texas, in September, 2006.|$|E
5|$|The nesting and {{breeding}} biology of antbirds {{have not been}} well studied. Even in relatively well-known species the breeding behaviour can be poorly known; for example the nest of the ocellated <b>antbird</b> was first described in 2004. Nests are constructed by both parents, although the male undertakes more {{of the work in}} some species. <b>Antbird</b> nests are cups of vegetation such as twigs, dead leaves and plant fibre, and they follow two basic patterns: either suspended or supported. Suspended cups, which may hang from forks in branches, or between two branches, are the more common style of nest. Supported nests rest upon branches, amongst vines, in hollows, and sometimes on mounds of vegetation on the ground. Each species nests at the level where it forages, so a midstory species would build its nest in the midstory. Closely related species nest in the same ways. For example, antvireos in the genus Dysithamnus are all suspension nesters.|$|E
2500|$|There are twenty-one {{species of}} <b>antbirds</b> that {{participate}} in [...] "bivouac checking", {{which is a}} specialized behavior allowing for the <b>antbirds</b> to assess the Eciton burchellii colony's foraging activity and current location. This allows the <b>antbirds</b> to reduce the time spent tracking a colony that is not foraging. Through bivouac checking, the <b>antbirds</b> might be remembering the correct location of colonies and returning to them {{at the appropriate time}} in the colony's foraging cycle.|$|R
5|$|<b>Antbirds</b> are diurnal: they feed, breed {{and defend}} territories during the day. Many {{of the family}} are, however, {{reluctant}} to enter areas of direct sunlight where it breaks through the forest canopy. <b>Antbirds</b> will engage in anting, a behaviour in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten. While this has conventionally been considered a way to remove and control feather parasites, {{it has been suggested}} that for <b>antbirds</b> it may simply be a way to deal with the distasteful substances in prey items.|$|R
5|$|Most <b>antbirds</b> have proportionately large, heavy bills. Several genera of antshrike have a {{strongly}} hooked tip to the bill, and all <b>antbirds</b> have a notch or 'tooth' {{at the tip}} of the bill which helps in holding and crushing insect prey. The two genera of bushbirds have upturned chisel-like bills.|$|R
5|$|Antbirds {{are mostly}} birds of humid lowland rainforests. Few species are found at higher elevations, {{with less than}} 10% of species having ranges above 2000 m (6500ft) and almost none with ranges above 3000 m (10000ft). The highest species {{diversity}} {{is found in the}} Amazon basin, with up to 45 species being found in single locations in sites across Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. The number of species drops dramatically towards the further reaches of the family's range; there are only seven species in Mexico, for example. Areas of lower thamnophilid diversity may contain localised endemics, however. The Yapacana <b>antbird,</b> for example, is restricted to the stunted woodlands that grow in areas of nutrient-poor white-sand soil (the so-called Amazonian caatinga) in Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia. Some species are predominantly associated with microhabitats within a greater ecosystem; for example, the bamboo antshrike is predominantly found in bamboo patches.|$|E
5|$|As of April 2008, 38 {{species are}} {{considered}} by the IUCN to be near threatened or worse and therefore at risk of extinction. Antbirds are neither targeted by the pet trade nor {{large enough to be}} hunted; the principal cause of the decline in <b>antbird</b> species is habitat loss. The destruction or modification of forests has several effects on different species of antbirds. The fragmentation of forests into smaller patches affects species that are averse to crossing gaps as small as roads. If these species become locally extinct in a fragment, this reluctance to cross unforested barriers makes their re-establishment unlikely. Smaller forest fragments are unable to sustain mixed-species feeding flocks, leading to local extinctions. Another risk faced by antbirds in fragmented habitat is increased nest predation. An unplanned experiment in fragmentation occurred on Barro Colorado Island, a former hill in Panama that became an isolated island during the flooding caused by the creation of the Panama Canal. Numerous species of <b>antbird</b> formerly resident in the area were extirpated, in no small part due to increased levels of nest predation on the island. While the species lost from Barro Colorado are not globally threatened, they illustrate the vulnerability of species in fragmented habitats and help explain the declines of some species. The majority of threatened species have very small natural ranges. Some are also extremely poorly known; for example the Rio de Janeiro antwren is known only from a single specimen collected in 1982, although there have been unconfirmed reports since 1994 and it is currently listed as critically endangered. Additionally, new species are discovered at regular intervals; the Caatinga antwren was described in 2000, the acre antshrike in 2004, the sincorá antwren in 2007, and the description of a relative of the Paraná antwren discovered in 2005 in the outskirts of São Paulo is being prepared. While not yet scientifically described, conservation efforts have already been necessary, as the site of discovery was set out to be flooded to form a reservoir. Consequently, 72 individuals were captured and transferred to another locality.|$|E
5|$|The <b>antbird</b> family {{contains}} over 200 species, variously called antwrens, antvireos, antbirds and antshrikes. The names {{refer to}} the relative sizes of the birds (increasing in the order given, though with exceptions) rather than any particular resemblance to the true wrens, vireos or shrikes. In addition, members of the genus Phlegopsis are known as bare-eyes, Pyriglena as fire-eyes and Neoctantes and Clytoctantes as bushbirds. Although the systematics of the Thamnophilidae is based on studies from the mid-19th century, when fewer than half the present species were known, comparison of the myoglobin intron 2, GAPDH intron 11 and the mtDNA cytochrome b DNA sequences has largely confirmed it. There are two major clades – most antshrikes and other larger, strong-billed species as well as Herpsilochmus, versus the classical antwrens and other more slender, longer-billed species – and the monophyly of most genera was confirmed.|$|E

50|$|The blackish-grey antshrike (Thamnophilus nigrocinereus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thamnophilidae, the <b>antbirds.</b>|$|R
5|$|The family uses {{a number}} of {{techniques}} to obtain prey. The majority of antbirds are arboreal, with most of those feeding in the understory, many in the middle story and some in the canopy. A few species feed in the leaf litter; for example, the wing-banded <b>antbird</b> forages in areas of dense leaf-litter. It does not use its feet to scratch the leaf litter, as do some other birds; instead it uses its long bill to turn over leaves rapidly (never picking them up). The antbirds that forage arboreally show {{a number of}} techniques and specialisations. Some species perch-glean, perching on a branch watching for prey and snatching it by reaching forward, where others sally from a perch and snatch prey on the wing. In both cases birds will hop through the foliage or undergrowth and pause, scanning for prey, before pouncing or moving on. The time paused varies, although smaller species {{tend to be more}} active and pause for shorter times.|$|E
5|$|Because army ants are {{unpredictable}} {{in their}} movements, it is impractical for obligate ant-followers {{to maintain a}} territory that always contains swarms to feed around. Antbirds have evolved a more complicated system than the strict territoriality of most other birds. They generally (details vary among species) maintain breeding territories but travel outside those territories in order to feed at swarms. Several pairs {{of the same species}} may attend a swarm, with the dominant pair at the swarm being the pair which holds the territory that the swarm is in. In addition to competition within species, competition among species exists, and larger species are dominant. In its range, the ocellated <b>antbird</b> is the largest of the obligate ant-following antbirds and is dominant over other members of the family, although it is subordinate to various species from other families (including certain woodcreepers, motmots and the rufous-vented ground cuckoo). At a swarm, the dominant species occupies positions above the central front of the swarm, which yields the largest amount of prey. Smaller, less dominant species locate themselves further away from the centre, or higher above the location of the dominant species, where prey is less plentiful.|$|E
5|$|Almost all antbirds lay two eggs. A few {{species of}} antshrike lay three eggs, {{and a smaller}} number of antbirds lay one egg, but this is unusual. Small clutch sizes are typical of {{tropical}} birds compared to more temperate species of the same size, possibly due to nest predation, although this is disputed. Both parents participate in incubation, although only the female incubates at night. The length of time taken for chicks to hatch is 14–16 days in most species, although some, such as the dusky <b>antbird,</b> can take as long as 20 days. The altricial chicks are born naked and blind. Both parents brood the young until they are able to thermoregulate, although, as with incubation, only the female broods at night. In common with many songbirds, the parents take faecal sacs for disposal away from the nest. Both parents feed the chicks, often bringing large prey items. When the chicks reach fledging age, after 8–15 days, attending parents call their chicks. As each chick leaves the nest it is cared for exclusively from then on by the parent that was present then. After the first chick fledges and leaves with a parent the remaining parent may increase the supply of food to speed up the process of fledging. After fledging, chicks spend the first few days well hidden as the parents bring them food. Chicks of some species may not become independent of the parents for as long as four months in some antwrens, but two months is more typical {{for the rest of the}} family.|$|E

40|$|In many vertebrates, {{elevated}} levels of plasma testosterone (T) are important for reproduction and territorial aggression. However, many tropical birds reproduce and defend territories while plasma T-levels are basal. We studied how aggression and T-levels are regulated in male neotropical spotted <b>antbirds,</b> which defend territories year-round in the Panamanian rainforest. Although spotted <b>antbirds</b> reproduce seasonally, T-levels of individual males often remained at baseline (0. 2 ng ml- 1) throughout the year, even in courting males. On the other hand, T-levels were elevated (maximally to 1. 57 ng ml- 1) during periods of social instability {{at any time of}} the year, even when males had entirely regressed gonads. Experimental territorial intrusions (broadcast of conspecific song) confirmed these observations by showing that T-levels increased after about two hours of playback time. Our data suggest that spotted <b>antbirds</b> avoided the potential costs associated with constantly high plasma T-levels (e. g. increased mortality rates). Contrary to temperate zone birds, spotted <b>antbirds</b> had the potential to react to social challenges with an increase of plasma T year-round. These results are, to our knowledge, presently unique, but may apply to many vertebrate species that inhabit the tropics...|$|R
25|$|The <b>antbirds</b> have a {{parasitic}} {{relationship with}} Eciton burchellii which inflicts a cost that {{is proportional to}} the number of birds in the flock. This imposes a selective pressure on the colonies, as the arthropods collected from these raids represent nearly half of the food consumed by the ants. To counter-act the <b>antbird's</b> kleptoparasitism, large prey items have been observed to be dragged under the leaf litter before being processed. Also, food caches arise along the foraging trail, protected by the colony's soldiers.|$|R
25|$|While foraging, army ants cause many {{invertebrates}} to {{flee from}} their hiding places under {{leaves of the}} forest floor, under tree bark, and other such locations, thereby allowing predators to catch them more easily. For example, in the tropical rainforests of Panama, swarms of army ants attract many species of birds to this feast of scrambling insects, spiders, scorpions, worms, and other animals. Some of these birds are named “antbirds” due to this tendency. While focused on feeding on these invertebrates, birds at army-ant swarms typically allow very close approach by people—within 1 or 2 meters in many cases—often providing the best opportunities to see many of these species. Depending {{on the size of}} the ant swarm and the amount of prey the ants stir up, birds can number from a few to dozens of individuals. Birds that frequent army-ant swarms include the white-whiskered puffbird, rufous motmot, rufous-vented ground cuckoo, gray-necked wood rail, plain-brown woodcreeper, northern barred woodcreeper, cocoa woodcreeper, black-striped woodcreeper, fasciated antshrike, black-crowned antshrike, spotted <b>antbird,</b> bicolored <b>antbird,</b> ocellated <b>antbird,</b> chestnut-backed <b>antbird,</b> black-faced antthrush, and gray-headed tanager.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} studies have found no {{evidence}} of the dear enemy effect showing the effect is not universal. Territorial males of the strawberry dart-poison frog (Dendrobates pumilio) and the spotted <b>antbird</b> (Hylophylax naevioides) do not discriminate behaviourally between the calls of neighbours and strangers, and female collared lizards show no difference in their behaviour to neighbouring or unfamiliar females.|$|E
500|$|Antbirds are monogamous, {{in almost}} all cases forming pair bonds that last {{the life of the}} pair. [...] Studies of the dusky <b>antbird</b> and the white-bellied <b>antbird</b> did not find [...] "infidelity". In the white-plumed <b>antbird</b> divorces between pairs are common, but, as far as known, this species is exceptional. In most species the pair defends a classic territory, {{although}} the nesting territories of ant followers are slightly different (see feeding above). Territories vary in size from as small as 0.5 ha for the Manu <b>antbird,</b> to 1500 m (5000ft) in diameter for the ocellated <b>antbird.</b> Ocellated antbirds have an unusual social system where the breeding pair forms the nucleus of a group or clan that includes their male offspring and their mates. These clans, which can number up to eight birds, work together to defend territories against rivals. Pair bonds are formed with courtship feeding, where the male presents food items to the female. In spotted antbirds males may actually feed females sufficiently for the female to cease feeding herself, although she will resume feeding once copulation has occurred. Mutual grooming also plays a role in courtship in some species.|$|E
40|$|Hylophylax naevia of {{moderately}} dense forest undergrowth and H. punctulata of open swamp undergrowth tend to sally for arthropods in low foliage {{rather than}} sally {{to the ground}} among large ant-following <b>antbirds.</b> They and related Hypocnemoides melanopogon of swamp understory edges are also limited by their microhabitat niches in following ants.

500|$|The <b>antbird</b> family Thamnophilidae {{used to be}} {{considered}} [...] a subfamily, Thamnophilinae, within a larger family Formicariidae that included antthrushes and antpittas.

500|$|Swarms of army ants are an {{important}} resource used by some species of <b>antbird,</b> and the one from which the family's common name is derived. Many species of tropical ant form large raiding swarms, but the swarms are often nocturnal or raid underground. While birds visit these swarms when they occur, the species most commonly attended by birds is the Neotropical species Eciton burchellii, which is both diurnal and surface-raiding. It was once thought that attending birds were actually eating the ants, but numerous studies {{in various parts of}} Eciton burchellii's range has shown that the ants act as beaters, flushing insects, other arthropods and small vertebrates into the waiting flocks of [...] "ant followers". The improvement in foraging efficiency can be dramatic; a study of spotted antbirds found that they made attempts at prey every 111.8 seconds away from ants, but at swarms they made attempts every 32.3 seconds. While many species of antbirds (and other families) may opportunistically feed at army ant swarms, 18 species of <b>antbird</b> are obligate ant-followers, obtaining most of their diet from swarms. With only three exceptions, these species never regularly forage away from ant swarms. A further four species regularly attend swarms but are as often seen away from them. Obligate ant-followers visit the nesting bivouacs of army ants in the morning to check for raiding activities; other species do not. These species tend to arrive at swarms first, and their calls are used by other species to locate swarming ants.|$|E
500|$|Many species {{participate}} in mixed-species feeding flocks, forming {{a large percentage}} of the participating species within their range. Some of these are core or [...] "nuclear species". These nuclear species share territories with other nuclear species but exclude conspecifics (members of the same species) and are found in almost all flocks; these are joined by [...] "attendant species". Loud and distinctive calls and conspicuous plumage are important attributes of nuclear species as they promote cohesion in the flock. The composition of these flocks varies geographically; in Amazonia species of Thamnomanes antshrike are the leading nuclear species; elsewhere other species, such as the dot-winged antwrens and checker-throated antwrens, fill this role. Other species of antwren and <b>antbird</b> join them along with woodcreepers, ant-tanagers, foliage-gleaners and greenlets. The benefits of the mixed flock are thought to be related to predation, since many eyes are better for spotting predatory hawks and falcons. Comparisons between multi-species feeding flocks in different parts of the world found that instances of flocking were positively correlated with predation risk by raptors. For example, where Thamnomanes antshrikes lead the group they give loud warning calls in the presence of predators. These calls are understood and reacted to by all the other species in the flock. The advantage to the Thamnomanes antshrikes is in allowing the rest of the flock, which are typically gleaners, to act as beaters, flushing prey while foraging which the antshrikes can obtain by sallying. Similar roles are filled in other flocks by other <b>antbird</b> species or other bird families, for example the shrike-tanagers. Within the feeding flocks competition is reduced by microniche partitioning; where dot-winged antwrens, checker-throated antwrens and white-flanked antwrens feed in flocks together, the dot-wings feed in the densest vines, the white-flank in less dense vegetation, and the checker-throats in the same density as the latter but in dead foliage only.|$|E
5000|$|While foraging, white-plumed <b>antbirds</b> {{may remain}} {{immobile}} {{for long periods}} of time so that they will not be attacked by larger <b>antbirds</b> or predators. In case of confrontation or alarm, they may [...] "panic, flee and chip" [...] instead. This reaction to danger involves the bird darting back and forth making chipping noises, spreading its tail and flicking rapidly to find their last prey items before fleeing. In reaction to human presence, the bird tends to make a chirring sound and mob the intruder.|$|R
50|$|White-plumed <b>antbirds</b> {{are very}} {{persistent}} in {{holding on to}} territories and may remain even in case of conflict with other individuals, if enough food sources are available. They are generally solitary outside of the breeding season and will tend to follow individual ant swarms through the forest.Like other <b>antbirds,</b> they perform anting, which {{is the process of}} brushing small insects through their wing and tail feathers. It is still unknown whether the main function of this process is to ease irritation during moulting, kill mites, or detoxify distasteful insects.|$|R
5|$|The {{songs and}} calls of <b>antbirds</b> are {{generally}} composed of repeated simple uncomplicated notes. The family {{is one of}} the suboscines (suborder Tyranni) which have simpler syrinxes ("voiceboxes") than other songbirds. Nevertheless, their songs are distinctive and species-specific, allowing field identification by ear. <b>Antbirds</b> rely on their calls for communication, as is typical of birds in dark forests. Most species have at least two types of call, the loudsong and the softsong. The functions of many calls have been deduced from their context; for example some loudsongs have a territorial purpose and are given when birds meet at the edges of their territories, or during the morning rounds of the territory. Pairs in neighbouring territories judge the proximity of rivals by the degradation of the song caused by interference by the environment. In bouts of territorial defence the male will face off with the other male and the female with her counterpart. Loudsong duets are also potentially related to the maintenance of pair bonds. The functions of softsongs are more complex, and possibly related to pair-bond maintenance. In addition to these two main calls a range of other sounds are made; these include scolding in mobbing of predators. The calls of <b>antbirds</b> are also used interspecifically. Some species of <b>antbirds</b> and even other birds will actively seek out ant-swarms using the calls of some species of ant-followers as clues.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are many}} species of birds that use the {{foraging}} practices of the Eciton burchellii {{as a source of}} food. When the ant colony swarms the forest leaf litter, arthropods flee, which are then eaten by the birds, lizards, insects, and even some mammals that attend the raids. [...] However, this source of food can be unpredictable, as the Eciton burchellii colonies' raiding zones are always shifting. It has been shown that the obligate army ant-following <b>antbird</b> Phaenostictus mcleannani uses a network of individuals to locate swarms. Each mated pair of birds holds a single dominance zone that they control, which {{is part of a larger}} non-exclusive feeding zone occupied by other mated pairs. Consequently, a single mated pair may track several colonies a day by drawing on the collective knowledge of this larger network. Departure calls can be used as cues to tell the other mate where the location of the raid is. However, it has been shown that there is little opportunity for kin selection to influence group feeding in the antbirds.|$|E
