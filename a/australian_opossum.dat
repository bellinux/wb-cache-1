40|$|A novel trihydroxylated C 24 {{bile acid}} was {{isolated}} from the gallbladder bile of the <b>Australian</b> <b>opossum,</b> Trichosurus vulpecula (Lesson). This acid, for which the name vulpecholic acid is proposed, was identified as 1 α, 3 α, 7 α-trihydroxy- 5 β-cholan- 24 -oic. The structure proof included mass spectral and 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance characterization of all crucial derivatives obtained by: a) oxidation of the methyl ester to a triketone with the enolizable 1, 3 -diketone function; b) methylation of this triketone to two isomeric methyl enol ethers; and c) reductive removal of oxygen functions from this triketone to give 5 β-cholan- 24 -oic and 7 -oxo- 5 β-cholan- 24 -oic acids. Vulpecholic acid {{was found in the}} bile in the unconjugated form; it accounted for more than 60 % of the solid bile material. The marsupial T. vulpecula is the first example of a mammal secreting a 1 α-hydroxylated bile acid as well as the first example of a mammal secreting the major bile acid in a free form. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Free vulpecholic acid (1 α, 3 α, 7 α-trihydroxy- 5 β-cholan- 24 -oic) is {{the major}} biliary {{component}} of the <b>Australian</b> <b>opossum</b> (Trichosurus vulpecula), accompanied only by a few percent of its taurine conjugate. In order to exclude a microbial involvement in its formation (i. e., secondary origin) four sets of experiments were performed. It was found that a) the level of vulpecholic acid remained unchanged in the bile of opossums fed with neomycin and kanamycin for 7 days prior to bile collection; b) it also remained unchanged after long bile drainage; c) in opossums prepared with biliary cannula, intraportally injected [24 - 14 C]chenodeoxycholic acid was transformed to [24 - 14 C]vulpecholic acid; and d) in a similar experiment, the detectable transformation of [1 α, 2 α- 3 H 2]cholesterol to vulpecholic acid was observed. In experiment c) 28 - 66 % of the administered radioactivity was secreted in 2 h {{in the form of}} free biliary vulpecholic and chenodeoxycholic acids. Only a trace amount of the corresponding taurine conjugates (~ 0. 4 %) was formed. Moreover, rapidly declining specific radioactivity of the unconjugated chenodeoxycholic acid indicated its probable participation in the native formation of vulpecholic acid. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand {{could be}} {{regarded}} as an acclimatization laboratory, i. e., the consequence {{of a wide range}} of animal introductions in the period 1840 - 1907. Species introduced ranged from camels to hedge-hogs, ostriches to sky larks. Fortunately many failed to survive. The majority of these liberations were made by Acclimatization Societies or private individuals, often with Government approval and protection. The most damaging species were several species of deer, rabbits, <b>Australian</b> <b>opossums,</b> goats, pigs, tahr, wallabies, and chamois. The establishment, natural dispersion and colonization of unoccupied habitat by these animals was successful and surpassed all expectations. Pastoral land development in the early days usually consisted of firing large tracts of indigenous forest and native grassland and this practice assisted the dispersion of some animals, particularly the rabbit. The impact of these animals was to upset the natural stability of habitat and damage soil and water values. As a result of these liberations a multiplicity of animal control problems have occurred. Organizations were constituted by Government with the responsibility of conducting control. They have in recent years made dramatic progress in reducing some animal populations such as rabbits to tolerable levels. This has only been achieved by positive policy changes over the years, plus the development and utilization of more effective control techniques, especially in the field of poisoning...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of vertebrate immunity from {{the level of}} the protochordates to that of the metatherians is reviewed. Using standard methods IgG, IgM and IgA were isolated from the serum or intestinal fluid of the <b>Australian</b> brush-tailed <b>opossum,</b> Trichosurus vulpecuia. These were characterized in terms of their molecular weights, amino acid and carbohydrate compositions and values for their concentrations in serum were calculated. Two forms of IgG were seen which differed in their abilities to bind to insoluble matrices and also in their molecular weights. No antigenic differences were seen between them on analysis by agar diffusion. The molecular weight of the IgA seen in intestinal fluid and results from its analysis by agar diffusion suggest that the molecule may lack secretory component. B lymphocytes were identified by their surface immunoglobulin and their complement and Fc receptors. The number of these cells in blood and various lymphoid tissues of T. vulpecula was found to be similar to the values reported for mice and humans. Lymphocyte fractionation on nylon wool columns confirmed that the markers employed were associated with an adherent cell population. Blood lymphocytes were stimulated in vitro with a range of mitogens and the degree of transformation achieved with each was assessed by the cells uptake of tritiated thymidine. Insoluble concanavalin A, pokeweed mitogen and lipopolysaccharide, in that order, were the most effective of the mitogens used on unfractionated blood lymphocytes. These three mitogens were further used in studies in which nylon wool fractionation of blood lymphocytes was used to prepare B cell- and T cell-enriched cultures. Lipopolysaccharide was the only mitogen to stimulate B cells more than T cells. Insoluble concanavalin A consistently stimulated T cells {{to a greater extent than}} B cells as did pokeweed mitogen. The ultrastructure of mitogen-stimulated cells was studied by electron microscopy and it was shown that lipopolysaccharide induced the formation of plasmablasts which resembled those of eutherians. Mitogen-stimulated cells were also analysed for their production of immunoglobulins, the levels of de novo synthesised materials being measured by their incorporation of isotope-labelled leucine provided in the culture medium. Both secreted and intracellular proteins were measured in this way. Lipopolysaccharide, pokeweed mitogen and insoluble concanavalin A all induced significantly increased levels of 19 S and 7 S secreted proteins, these proteins being separated by gel filtration. Pokeweed mitogen induced the synthesis of significantly increased levels of both 19 S and 7 S intracellular proteins, while lipopolysaccharide and insoluble concanavalin A significantly increased the levels of 19 S protein only. The presence of IgM and IgG in the 19 S and 7 S fractions was shown by their precipitation with class-specific antisera. The immune responses of T. vulpecula to a particulate and a soluble antigen were compared with those of rabbits to the same antigens. Sheep erythrocytes, at two dose levels, were injected intravenously. The responses of opossums to 5 x 109 erythrocytes were appreciably more rapid than those of the rabbits. The responses of the two species to 25 x 109 erythrocytes were similar in the titres attained and the time taken to do so. The distribution of haemagglutinating activity between IgM and IgG was studied and found to be essentially the same for both species for both levels of antigen. The responses of opossums to bovine serum albumin injected intramuscularly with Freund's adjuvants were similar to those of rabbits. It is concluded that the B cell-dependent immune functions of T. vulpecula are as efficient as those of other metatherians and compare favourably with those of eutherians...|$|R
