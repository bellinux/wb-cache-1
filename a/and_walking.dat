50|$|In 2003 P. L. Jacobsen {{compared}} {{rates of}} <b>walking</b> <b>and</b> cycling, {{in a range}} of countries, with rates of collisions between motorists and cyclists or walkers. He found an inverse correlation. This inverse correlation can be explained by theories including (1) safer <b>walking</b> <b>and</b> cycling conditions cause more people to walk and cycle, (2) more people <b>walking</b> <b>and</b> cycling cause <b>walking</b> <b>and</b> cycling to be safer, and (3) external factors cause <b>walking</b> <b>and</b> cycling to increase while simultaneously causing <b>walking</b> <b>and</b> cycling to be safer. For further discussion, see for example Correlation does not imply causation.|$|R

5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was filmed in late May, co-directed by the singer and her {{production}} team, Haus of Gaga. The video is simple in contrast to much of Gaga's previous work, and portrays her dancing on a fire-escape <b>and</b> <b>walking</b> on a lonely street. Differences include the lack of intricate choreography and back-up dancers, as well as using only one outfit designed by Versace. Critics lauded {{the simplicity of the}} video, while comparing it to the works of Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson and Madonna.

5|$|Cars are the {{preferred}} {{mode of transport}} in the suburb. At the 2011 census, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that 68.8% of Hamersley's residents were drivers or passengers of cars in their commute to work, a figure only slightly lower than the north metropolitan average of 71.3%. Other private modes of transport included motorcycling (0.7%), cycling (1.1%) <b>and</b> <b>walking</b> (1.3%). The low number of walking commuters compared to the north metropolitan average of 1.5% and the Perth Statistical Region average of 1.81% is most likely due to {{the limited number of}} workplaces within walking distance.|$|E

5|$|From 1876, the South Saskatchewan river {{crossing}} at St. Louis was via ferry. In 1912, the railway built a rail {{bridge across the}} river, and in 1928, the vehicle lanes were added. After 1907, the highway was constructed south of Chamberlain and reached Buffalo Pound. At this time two horse scrapers <b>and</b> <b>walking</b> plows were the implements of road construction technology. This highway received an improvement in 1926 which then used an elevating grader, 16 horses and a dump wagon.|$|E

40|$|Objective: There is {{increasing}} evidence that robot-assisted treadmill training {{might be useful}} for gait rehabilitation after stroke. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the muscle activity of stroke patients during robot-assisted <b>walking</b> <b>and</b> overground <b>walking,</b> <b>and</b> of a group of able-bodied subjects during overground walking. Design: Case-control observational study. Subjects: Ten stroke subjects and 10 able-bodied control subjects. Methods: Electromyography measurements of 7 lower-limb muscles were made in 3 trials: robotic walking, in which stroke subjects walked in a robot-assisted gait orthosis; overground walking for the same group of stroke subjects; <b>and</b> overground <b>walking</b> for control subjects. Trials were compared with respect to electromyography amplitude of selected leg muscles. Results: Higher muscle activity during overground walking compared with robotic walking was found in several muscles during several phases of the gait cycle. A significant trial × leg interaction revealed smaller differences in muscle activity between the paretic and non-paretic leg during robotic walking compared with overground walking. Furthermore, the muscle activity pattern was not significantly different between control <b>walking</b> <b>and</b> robotic <b>walking,</b> while it was different between control <b>walking</b> <b>and</b> overground <b>walking.</b> Conclusion: Despite lower muscle activity, robot-assisted treadmill training may elicit a more symmetrical pattern of leg muscle activity, which approaches that of able-bodied individuals. © 2012 Foundation of Rehabilitation Information...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Walking and {{environmental}} correlates have been increasingly investigated {{in the field}} of public health and transportation. Recent development in real-time activity and location tracking technology provides a unique opportunity to explore the relationship between <b>walking</b> <b>and</b> environments. This dissertation developed a methodology to measure PA and to classify types objectively (<b>walking</b> versus non-walking <b>and</b> utilitarian versus recreational) using such new-technology data (accelerometer and GPS). Based on the objective measures of <b>walking</b> <b>and</b> PA, the inter-relationships among PA components were analyzed. Findings showed that increased walking contributed to total PA without reducing other types of PA. This suggested that no substitutive behaviors existed between <b>walking</b> <b>and</b> other types of PA, <b>and</b> that more <b>walking</b> would correspond to a net increase in overall PA. In addition, differences between utilitarian <b>and</b> recreational <b>walking</b> were investigated. Utilitarian <b>and</b> recreational <b>walking</b> can be determined more objectively by travel diary and GPS data. It was shown that walking is not a one-kind behavior, <b>and</b> utilitarian <b>walking</b> should be distinguished from recreational walking. Environmental variables strongly predicted utilitarian walking but not recreational walking. Correlates of utilitarian walking seem to also apply to overall PA...|$|R
