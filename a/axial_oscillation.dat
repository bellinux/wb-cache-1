40|$|An <b>axial</b> <b>oscillation</b> tool is {{proved to}} be {{effective}} in solving problems associated with high friction and torque in the sliding drilling of a complex well. The fluidic <b>axial</b> <b>oscillation</b> tool, based on an output-fed bistable fluidic oscillator, is a type of <b>axial</b> <b>oscillation</b> tool which has become increasingly popular in recent years. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the dynamic flow behavior of a fluidic <b>axial</b> <b>oscillation</b> tool with the absence of a throttling plate in order to evaluate its overall performance. In particular, the differences between the original design with a throttling plate and the current default design are profoundly analyzed, and an improvement is expected to be recorded for the latter. A commercial computational fluid dynamics code, Fluent, was used to predict the pressure drop and oscillation frequency of a fluidic <b>axial</b> <b>oscillation</b> tool. The results of the numerical simulations agree well with corresponding experimental results. A sufficient pressure pulse amplitude with a low pressure drop is desired in this study. Therefore, a relative pulse amplitude of pressure drop and displacement are introduced in our study. A comparison analysis between the two designs with and without a throttling plate indicates that when the supply flow rate is relatively low or higher than a certain value, the fluidic <b>axial</b> <b>oscillation</b> tool with a throttling plate exhibits a better performance; otherwise, the fluidic <b>axial</b> <b>oscillation</b> tool without a throttling plate seems to be a preferred alternative. In most of the operating circumstances in terms of the supply flow rate and pressure drop, the fluidic <b>axial</b> <b>oscillation</b> tool performs better than the original design...|$|E
40|$|Thermally driven devices {{based on}} double-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} are proposed in this paper. Molecular dynamics simulations show that large-amplitude <b>axial</b> <b>oscillation</b> can be effectively excited {{for the local}} van der Waals potential barrier, Vloc, accessible by the thermal fluctuation. Besides the <b>axial</b> <b>oscillation,</b> the angular and transverse motion are observed and discussed.

40|$|The linear {{stability}} of the flow in the annular gap between two infinitely long cylinders, driven by the constant rotation and harmonic <b>oscillation</b> in the <b>axial</b> direction of the inner cylinder, is analysed using Floquet theory. Closed form solutions for the basic flow are derived, both with and without the presence of endwalls. Recent experiments and theory using the narrow gap approximation {{have shown that the}} <b>axial</b> <b>oscillations</b> significantly stabilize the flow with respect to centrifugal instabilities. However, the agreement has only been qualitative. The present analysis reproduces the experimental results to well within experimental uncertainty. We have identified the major source of discrepency with the previous theory to be {{due to the lack of}} global endwall effects enforcing a net zero axial mass flux.

40|$|The Orbitrap is a mass {{analyzer}} {{that employs}} an electrostatic field to confine ions.

The approximate equation governing the oscillations is derived with second-order rotational corrections. The equation contains an effective 'viscosity-like' term, which originates from coupling to the polar g-mode displacements. The term {{plays a crucial role}} on the resonance point, where the disturbance on the rotating stars satisfies a certain condition at the lowest order equation. The effect is significant for newly born hot neutron stars, which are expected to be subject to the gravitational radiation driven instability of the r-mode.

In this device the cloud temperature is read out not via thermal noise {{induced by the}} electrons in a coupled LC circuit but via shift in their <b>axial</b> <b>oscillation</b> frequency in the Penning trap confining them.

Vibration assisted machining been has demonstrated {{to reduce the amount of}} forces, pattern definition on a finished surface. <b>Axial</b> <b>oscillation</b> (parallel to the wheel axis) allows the grains to cut with two more faces. With vibration in two directions, the wheel exposes four times more cutting edges (two edges per oscillation) than in continuous cutting which uses only one edge, which is a great advantage over continuous cutting, <b>Axial</b> <b>oscillation</b> induces an elliptic motion leading to a lapping process, which improves the cutting efficiency as well as the quality of the finished surface.
