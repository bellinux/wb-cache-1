50|$|In 1946 Buick {{once again}} {{combined}} the large Series 70 Roadmaster {{body with the}} economical Series 40 Special powerplant to create the Series 50 Super line. Basic styling was continued from 1942 now sedans had the front fender sweep across {{the doors to the}} rear fenders as did the Sedanet and convertible styles. A stamped grille with vertical bars dominated the frontal ensemble. Single stainless body trim lines began on the front fenders and ended at the rear edge of the standard rear wheelhouse shields. Standard equipment included an automatic choke, clock, <b>ash</b> <b>receiver,</b> turn signals and woodgrained instrument panels. Exterior series identification was found on the crossbar between the bumper guards front and rear. Cloisonne emblems carried the Super emblem. Compound Carburetion was eliminated and the compression ratio was reduced to 6.30:1. As a consequence the 1946 Super's horsepower fell from 125 to 110. Torque on the other hand was hardly affected. The number of body styles increased to four with the return of the Estate wagon after a six year absence. A total of 119,334 units were sold. The front suspension was independent with coil springs. 76.98% of Buick sales this year were Supers.|$|E
5000|$|All {{the cars}} on the train {{featured}} Seamloc carpet made by Goodall Fabrics, in a palette of colors known as [...] "Araby" [...] (consisting of the colors Araby Peach, Dove Taupe, Jade, Lido Sand, Persian Rose, Silver Grey, and Turquoise). The hard flooring and wall covering materials used were Es Es and V-Board, both plastic products created by the United States Rubber Company, in the colors blue, brown, coral, gray-blue, gray-green, gray-tan, green, purple, and red. The train's interior paint was a semigloss from DuPont, its pull-down shades were manufactured by the Adams and Westlake Company and matched to the exterior colors of the train, while its [...] "decorative but nonfunctional drapes" [...] were supplied by Goodall Fabrics and backed with sateen from Lusskey, White, and Coolidge. The train featured couch seats from Haywood-Wakefield in chair car Star Dust {{and all of its}} domes except that of dining car Sky View; they were of tubular metal construction with sponge rubber seat and back cushions that could both rotate and recline, and each also had movable footrests and armrests with <b>ash</b> <b>receivers.</b> Those in the chair car had high backs, while those in the domes had low backs that measured only 25 in from the seat cushion {{to the top of the}} headrest.|$|R
50|$|Texas {{began the}} second half with a 75 yard drive which culminated in an eight yard {{touchdown}} pass from David <b>Ash</b> to wide <b>receiver</b> John Harris and featured a 26 yard run by Malcolm Brown. The rest {{of the third quarter}} remained scoreless from both teams, though North Texas failed to capitalize on a fumble recovery. In the fourth quarter, a long punt by North Texas punter Blake Macek led to the Longhorns beginning a drive at their own one yard line. A second fumble on a snap by David Ash was recovered by the Mean Green in the end zone, resulting in North Texas' first and only score of the game. On Texas' subsequent drive, kicker Nick Rose scored a 34 yard field goal. The following North Texas drive ended with Texas' Demarco Cobbs returning an interception for a touchdown. This was the team's final score, and the game ended 38-7 with Texas winning.|$|R
