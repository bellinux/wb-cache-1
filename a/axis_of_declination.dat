30|$|The two-axis {{tracking}} {{system could be}} an azimuth-elevation tracking or polar tracking. In azimuth-elevation tracking, {{which is the most}} common method used in large solar dish systems, the dish rotates in a plane parallel to the earth (azimuth) and in another plane perpendicular to it (elevation), which gives the collector left–right and up–down rotation. Rotational rates can be easily calculated during all day. In polar tracking, which is the most common method in small solar dish systems, the collector rotates about an axis parallel to the earth’s <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> rotation. The collector rotates at a constant rate of 15 ° per hour to match the rotational speed of the earth. The other <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> rotation, the <b>declination</b> <b>axis,</b> is perpendicular to the polar axis. Movement about this axis occurs slowly and varies by ± 23.5 ° over a year [13].|$|R

This width of the analemma is approximately 7.7°, so the length of the figure is more than six times its width.

40|$|Background: Talus {{is the key}} bone of {{the human}} body as it carries the whole weight of the body. Since the talus endures a lot of {{differential}} forces during locomotion, the stress patterns across the talus influence its overall dimensions. Research in skeletal biology and methodological approaches to the identification of human skeletal remains have advanced significantly in recent years. This study was undertaken because of the scarcity of the morphometric data in adult human dry tali of South Indian origin. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to estimate the angles <b>of</b> <b>declination</b> and inclination in adult human dry tali; to estimate the differences in the angles between right and left tali; and to report and estimate the differences in other morphological parameters such as maximum anterioposterior length of the talus, maximum transverse width of the talus, trochlear length, length of the sulcus tali, and width of the sulcus tali of right and left sides. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out on 50 (25 right and 25 left) adult dry tali of unknown ages and sexes over a period of 6 months in the Department of Anatomy, Amala Institute of Medical Sciences. The angles <b>of</b> <b>declination</b> and inclination were measured with goniometer. Other parameters were measured with digital Vernier calipers. Results: The mean angles <b>of</b> <b>declination</b> were 26 ° and 27 ° and those of inclination were 120 ° and 122 ° on the right and left sides, respectively. All the parameters measured showed no statistically significant difference between the right and left sides. Conclusion: The values of this study were relatively closer to the other studies. The parameters of this study may be helpful to surgeons, orthopedicians, and forensic anthropologists. KEY WORDS: Talus, angle of inclination, angle <b>of</b> <b>declination,</b> club foo...|$|R
40|$|Influenza, {{also known}} as the flu, {{is one of the most}} common {{seasonal}} illnesses with outbreaks occurring each year. Transmission of the influenza virus in a hospital setting is a significant concern, because although most cases of influenza are mild, up to 25 % require outpatient medical care, as many as 4 % require inpatient care, and 1 % require intensive care. One way to prevent influenza is through vaccination of those deemed to be high risk for contracting and spreading the disease, such as healthcare workers. The purpose of this study was to identify personal, demographic and professional characteristics of healthcare workers who decline influenza vaccination in a Southeastern United States teaching hospital. Characteristics examined in this study included gender, ethnicity, number of years employed at the hospital, personnel role and level of patient contact. The method for this research involved the utilization of existing (secondary) data from the 2010 - 2011 flu vaccination program gained from the employee database of the hospital. A population consisting of 22, 845 healthcare workers was observed. Findings included identification of African Americans as the ethnic group with the highest declination rate. Healthcare workers with little patient contact also had high rates <b>of</b> <b>declination.</b> While physicians and nurses had relatively low rates <b>of</b> <b>declination,</b> environmental service workers had a high rate <b>of</b> <b>declination.</b> This study concluded that although specific groups were identified with high rates <b>of</b> <b>declination,</b> further research is needed to determine the reason behind declination amongst these groups and if any relationship can be made with regard to education level or job title that affects <b>declination</b> <b>of</b> the influenza vaccine. Future research is needed to understand why healthcare workers decline vaccination and how to improve vaccination rates in this population.
