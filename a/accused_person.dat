5|$|The Court {{held that}} it can judicially review the {{exercise}} of prosecutorial power and declare a prosecution to be unconstitutional for breach of constitutional power, for example, if a prosecution is brought in bad faith for an ulterior motive and not to punish an <b>accused</b> <b>person</b> for an offence he or she committed. A prosecution {{can also be found}} to have infringed the accused person's constitutional rights. This may happen if law enforcement officers themselves commit crimes by using agents provocateur in a particularly egregious manner to entrap accused persons into committing crimes, and the Attorney-General elects to prosecute only the accused persons but not the officers, as this may infringe the accused persons' right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E

25|$|There {{is also a}} {{suggestion}} that the religious doctrine held by the <b>accused</b> <b>persons</b> was relevant {{to the issue of}} whether the content was objectionable or seditious. If the <b>accused</b> <b>persons</b> had religious beliefs {{similar to that of the}} tracts' author, it would have been unlikely that reasonable individuals in the position of the <b>accused</b> <b>persons</b> would have thought that the content was objectionable or seditious.|$|R

25|$|Section 24E allowed that, {{while an}} <b>accused</b> <b>person</b> might elect to be {{committed}} for trial, sedition could, {{with the consent of}} the Attorney-General, be prosecuted summarily, in which case the applicable penalty would be imprisonment for a period not exceeding 12 months.|$|E
25|$|Where a trial 'on indictment' {{has been}} prescribed, {{it is an}} {{essential}} element that it be found by a unanimous verdict of guilty by 12 lay members of the public. This requirement stems from the (historical) meaning of 'jury' {{at the time that}} the Constitution was written and is (in principle) thus an integral element of trial by jury. Unlike States, an <b>accused</b> <b>person</b> cannot elect a Judge-only trial.|$|E
25|$|A notice {{always had}} to be given several days before the {{assembly}} was to actually vote. For elections, at least three market-days (often more than seventeen actual days) had to pass between {{the announcement of the}} election, and the actual election. During this time period (the trinundinum), the candidates interacted with the electorate, and no legislation could be proposed or voted upon. In 98 BC, a law was passed (the lex Caecilia Didia) which required a similar three market-day interval to pass between the proposal of a law and the vote on that law. During criminal trials, the assembly's presiding magistrate had to give a notice (diem dicere) to the <b>accused</b> <b>person</b> {{on the first day of}} the investigation (anquisito). At the end of each day, the magistrate had to give another notice to the <b>accused</b> <b>person</b> (diem prodicere), which informed him of the status of the investigation. After the investigation was complete, a three market-day interval had to elapse before a final vote could be taken with respect to conviction or acquittal.|$|E
25|$|It was {{difficult}} to believe that in their fervour to spread the gospel truth, both <b>accused</b> <b>persons</b> did not read the publications. The titles were sufficiently arousing for someone to at least flip through their contents. Furthermore, given that the <b>accused</b> <b>persons</b> consciously undertook this evangelical exercise to convert persons of other faiths, they must have known the contents of the tracts they were distributing.|$|R

25|$|Each {{state may}} {{determine}} the extent to which the use of a jury is used. The use of a jury is optional for civil trials in any Australian state. The use of a jury in criminal trials is generally by unanimous verdict of 12 lay members of the public. Some States provide exceptions such as majority (11-to-1 or 10-to-2) verdicts where a jury cannot otherwise reach a verdict. Sometimes a state law may allow an <b>accused</b> <b>person</b> to elect to use a judge-only trial rather than the default jury provision.|$|E
25|$|Before an <b>accused</b> <b>person</b> is {{committed}} to trial in the High Court, a committal hearing must be held before an examining magistrate {{to determine if there}} is sufficient evidence for the accused to be put on trial. An accused may be committed for trial at once if he or she wishes to plead guilty (except to an offence punishable by death), {{the facts of the case}} presented by the prosecution disclose sufficient grounds for committing the accused, and the magistrate is satisfied that the accused understands the nature of the charge against him or her and intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him or her.|$|E
25|$|On 27 February 2012 Andrea Gilroy, David Gilroy's wife, {{was cited}} as a witness by the Crown. As she took the stand, the trial judge Lord Bracadale {{explained}} {{that she had the}} right not to give evidence against her husband if she did not wish. She declined to give evidence. Mrs Gilroy could only decline to give evidence because the events she would speak to took place before section 86 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 came into force. This act amended the law such that spouses and civil partners of an <b>accused</b> <b>person</b> in Scotland, are competent and compellable witnesses for the prosecution.|$|E

25|$|Confronted {{with this}} sharp {{increase}} in cases, Belgium established the condition that the <b>accused</b> <b>person</b> must be Belgian or present in Belgium. An arrest warrant issued in 2000 under this law, against the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was challenged before the International Court of Justice in the case entitled ICJ Arrest Warrant Case. The ICJ's decision issued on 14 February 2002 found {{that it did not}} have jurisdiction to consider the question of universal jurisdiction, instead deciding the question on the basis of immunity of high-ranking state officials. However, the matter was addressed in separate and dissenting opinions, such as that of President Guillaume who concluded that universal jurisdiction exists only in relation to piracy; and the dissenting opinion of Judge Oda who recognised piracy, hijacking, terrorism and genocide as crimes subject to universal jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|In an inquisitorial {{system of}} law, the {{examining}} magistrate (also called investigating magistrate, inquisitorial magistrate, or investigating judge), is {{a judge who}} carries out pre-trial investigations into allegations of crime {{and in some cases}} makes a recommendation for prosecution. The exact role and standing of examining magistrates varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; common duties and powers of the examining magistrate include overseeing ongoing criminal investigations, issuing search warrants, authorizing wiretaps, making decisions on pretrial detention, interrogating the <b>accused</b> <b>person,</b> questioning witnesses, examining evidence, and compiling a dossier of evidence in preparation for trial. Examining magistrates have {{an important role in the}} French judiciary, and are also a feature of the Spanish, Dutch, Belgian and Greek criminal justice systems, although the extent of the examining magistrate's role has generally diminished over time. Several countries, including Switzerland, Germany, Portugal, and Italy, have abolished the position of examining magistrate outright.|$|E
25|$|Queen Ranavalona I (reigned 1828–1861) {{issued a}} royal edict prohibiting the {{practice}} of Christianity in Madagascar, expelled British missionaries from the island, and sought to stem the growth of conversion to Christianity within her realm. Many Malagasy citizens were put to death during this period {{as a consequence of}} their refusal to recant their Christian faith. Far more, however, were punished in other ways: many were required to undergo the tangena ordeal, while others were condemned to hard labor or the confiscation of their land and property, and many of these consequently died. The tangena ordeal was commonly administered to determine the guilt or innocence of an <b>accused</b> <b>person</b> for any crime, including {{the practice of}} Christianity, and involved ingestion of the poison contained within the nut of the tangena tree (Cerbera odollam). Survivors were deemed innocent, while those who perished were assumed guilty.|$|E
25|$|In Ong Kian Cheong, District Judge Neighbour {{stated that}} while {{people may have}} a desire to profess and spread their faith, the right to {{propagate}} such opinions cannot be unfettered. He found that both the <b>accused</b> <b>persons,</b> by distributing the seditious and objectionable tracts to Muslims and the general public, clearly reflected their intolerance, insensitivity and ignorance of delicate issues concerning race and religion in Singapore's multiracial and multi-religious society. Furthermore, in distributing the seditious and offensive tracts to spread their faith, the <b>accused</b> <b>persons</b> used the postal service to achieve their purpose and so were shielded by anonymity until {{the time they were}} apprehended. There is no doubt that this must have made it difficult for the police to trace them. In view of these circumstances, his Honour found that custodial sentences were warranted for both <b>accused</b> <b>persons.</b>|$|R

25|$|The High Court {{may also}} {{exercise}} powers of revision {{in respect of}} criminal proceedings and matters in subordinate courts. On calling for and examining the records of criminal proceedings or otherwise, the Court may direct a magistrate to make further inquiries into any complaints of offences that have been dismissed, or into the case of any <b>accused</b> <b>person</b> who has been discharged. The Court may also exercise powers that it exercises upon an appeal, such as reversing a conviction or altering a sentence, except that the Court is not authorized to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction to convert a finding of acquittal into one of conviction. As in civil cases, when the Court is exercising its powers of revision {{it is up to}} it {{to decide whether or not}} to hear submissions from any party, and no party can claim a right to be heard. However, no order that prejudices an accused shall be made unless he or she has had an opportunity of being heard either personally or by advocate in his or her own defence. When a case has been revised by the High Court, it will certify its decision or order to the trial court, which may then make further orders that conform to the certified decision.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the changes}} made was {{replacing}} the Discipline Committee of ARCUK with a Professional Conduct Committee under Part III of the Act with statutory powers to inflict fines expressly {{on a par with}} criminal penalties. Under the Act, the committee was to be a body having persons who were not themselves members of the profession in the decisive majority and who would not necessarily have the appropriate skill and knowledge to be able to act competently and fairly in respect of hazarding an architect's professional reputation or livelihood; nor would members of the committee be acting under the judicial oath of a judge or a magistrate in a court of criminal or civil jurisdiction, or pursuant to the consensual jurisdiction of an arbitrator. As a safeguard of due process in accordance with the rule of law the statutory provisions for constituting the Professional Conduct Committee in Part II of Schedule 1 of the Act (and as later amended) reflect the usual practice for appointing a legally qualified chairman, with appropriate experience, who can be held to have a professional and judicial responsibility for protecting the basic right of any <b>accused</b> <b>person,</b> whose reputation and livelihood could be at stake, to a fair and unprejudiced hearing and trial.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal only hears appeals from {{decisions}} of the High Court made when the latter is exercising original criminal jurisdiction. In other words, matters heard by the High Court on appeal from the State Courts cannot be further appealed to the Court of Appeal, though questions of law may be reserved for determination by the Court (see below). A person convicted in the High Court can appeal against the conviction, the sentence or both, unless he or she pleaded guilty in which case only an appeal against the extent or legality of the sentence is permitted. In the latter situation, the Court of Appeal may nonetheless permit the person who pleaded guilty to appeal against conviction if it believes that {{this is in the}} interests of justice. The Public Prosecutor may appeal against an acquittal or the sentence imposed on an <b>accused</b> <b>person.</b> The Court is entitled to summarily reject an appeal if the grounds of appeal do not involve any question of law, the conviction is supportable by the evidence, and {{there is nothing in the}} circumstances of the case which raises a reasonable doubt as to whether the conviction was right or leads the Court to think the sentence should be reduced. The summary rejection of an appeal may only be done upon the unanimous decision of the Judges of Appeal.|$|E

500|$|Dietrich {{suggested}} {{three different}} sources in {{law for the}} right to counsel that he asserted. The first was section 397 of the Victorian Crimes Act 1958, (now repealed), which provided that [...] "every <b>accused</b> <b>person</b> shall be admitted after the close of the case for the prosecution to make full answer and defence thereto by legal practitioner". However, the court found that this provision only means that an accused is entitled to counsel paid for by themselves or someone else, and not counsel provided by the state.|$|E

This means substantially {{that it has been}} made in the exercise of his free choice. If he speaks because he is overborne, his confessional statement cannot be received in evidence and it does not matter by what means he has been overborne. If his statement is the result of duress, intimidation, persistent importunity, or sustained or undue insistence or pressure, it cannot be voluntary. But it is also a definite rule of the common law that a confessional statement cannot be voluntary if it is preceded by an inducement held out by a person in authority and the inducement has not been removed before the statement is made..." ...|$|E
