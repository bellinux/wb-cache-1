5|$|After reigning two years, Amon {{was assassinated}} by his servants, who conspired against him, and was succeeded {{by his son}} Josiah, {{who at the time}} was eight years old. After Amon's {{assassination}} his murderers became unpopular with the people, and were ultimately killed. Some scholars, such as Abraham Malamat, assert that Amon was assassinated because people disliked the heavy influence that Assyria, <b>an</b> <b>age-old</b> enemy of Judah responsible for the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel, had upon him.|$|E
5|$|The Army Corps of Engineers {{commenced}} work on The Dalles Dam in 1952 {{and completed}} it five years later. On March 10, 1957, hundreds of observers looked on as a rising Lake Celilo rapidly silenced the falls, submerged fishing platforms, and consumed {{the village of}} Celilo, ending <b>an</b> <b>age-old</b> existence for those who lived there. A small Native American community exists today at nearby Celilo Village, on a bluff overlooking the former location of the falls.|$|E

5|$|While the European {{encounter}} with the black swan along Australia's west coast in the late 17th and early 18th centuries led to the shattering of <b>an</b> <b>age-old</b> metaphor, their contact {{on the east coast}} in the late 18th and early 19th centuries merely confirmed the new post-proverbial view, before turning to account for the black swan as just one more curiosity in the South to be utilised in developing the colonies.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a cause célèbre {{from the late}} 1960s to the 1980s, the mythical Priory of Sion was exposed as a ludibrium created by Plantard {{as a framework for}} his claim of being the Great Monarch prophesied by Nostradamus. Evidence presented in support of its historical existence and activities before 1956 was discovered to have been forged and then planted in various locations around France by Plantard and his accomplices. Nevertheless, many conspiracy theorists still persist in believing that the Priory of Sion is <b>an</b> <b>age-old</b> cabal that conceals a subversive secret.|$|E
5|$|By 354/353 BC, in just 5 {{years since}} his accession, Philip had unified Macedon {{and turned it}} into the {{dominant}} power in Northern Greece. He had completely reduced Athenian influence in the region, and was allied to the other major Greek power in the region, the Chalkidian League. He had, in the process, secured access to the Aegean sea, which had been <b>an</b> <b>age-old</b> problem in Macedon, since suitable sites had been monopolised by Greek colonists in the Archaic period. Furthermore, he had overhauled and re-trained the army, which was now battle-hardened, and he now had a supply of ready money to pay for more troops.|$|E

60|$|His {{tone was}} cold and ironical; its {{bitterness}} but reflecting the terrible disappointment he had suffered. Such a fearful disillusionment, such a blasting of life-long hopes and aspirations, such <b>an</b> uprooting of <b>age-old</b> tradition might have excused a vastly greater demonstration {{on the part of}} the Thark.|$|R
40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly clear that we are entering {{a new era in}} systems software. <b>As</b> the <b>age-old</b> tension between structure and performance acquiesces, we can finally venture beyond monolithic systems and explore alternative modularizations better suited to evolution and adaptation. The OASIS project explores the potential of aspects to naturally shape crosscutting system concerns as they grow and change. This paper describes ongoing work to modularize evolving concerns within high-performance state-of-the-art systems software, and outlines some of the major challenges that lie ahead within this domain. 1...|$|R
5|$|The art of batik is {{most highly}} {{developed}} in the island of Java in Indonesia. In Java, all the materials for the process are readily available — cotton and beeswax and plants from which different vegetable dyes are made. Indonesian batik predates written records: G. P. Rouffaer argues that the technique might have been introduced during the 6th or 7th century from India or Sri Lanka. On the other hand, the Dutch archaeologist J.L.A. Brandes and the Indonesian archaeologist F.A. Sutjipto believe Indonesian batik is a native tradition, since other regions in Indonesia such as Toraja, Flores, Halmahera, and Papua, which were not directly influenced by Hinduism, have <b>an</b> <b>age-old</b> tradition of batik making.|$|E
5|$|Various esoteric {{organizations}} {{that emerged in}} the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the Theosophical Society and the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, repeated the beliefs that had originated with Sethos: that Egyptians underwent initiation within the pyramids and that Greek philosophers were initiates who learned Egypt's secret wisdom. Esoteric writers influenced by Theosophy, such as Reuben Swinburne Clymer in his 1909 book The Mystery of Osiris and Manly Palmer Hall in Freemasonry of the Ancient Egyptians in 1937, also wrote of <b>an</b> <b>age-old</b> Egyptian mystery tradition. An elaborate example of these beliefs is the 1954 book Stolen Legacy by George James, which claims that Greek philosophy was built on knowledge stolen from the Egyptian school of initiates. James imagined this mystery school as a grandiose organization with branches on many continents, so that the purported system of Egyptian mysteries shaped cultures all over the world.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{departure}} leaves Bella {{depressed and}} isolated for months. Unable {{to understand her}} erratic and despondent actions, her father, Charlie, who works as the police chief of Forks, decides to send Bella {{to live with her}} mother in Jacksonville, Florida, but Bella opposes, and decides {{to spend more time with}} her other friends in Forks. After seeing a movie with Jessica, Bella sees a group of men on motorcycles. This reminds her of when Edward previously rescued her from a previous assault, and she sees his image, warning her to keep away. Bella discovers that any thrill-seeking activities she engages will evoke Edward's preserved image. She is also comforted by Jacob Black, a cheerful companion who helps to ease her pain over losing Edward. When Jacob suddenly begins avoiding her, Bella discovers that he, and others of his tribe, are descended from a long line of werewolves, and Jacob has just undergone his first transformation. Bella also learns that the werewolves are <b>an</b> <b>age-old</b> enemy of vampires. Jacob's pack members are on constant alert for Victoria, a vampire seeking to avenge the death of her mate, James, who was killed by Edward after James kidnapped and tried to kill Bella. They rescue Bella from Laurent when he tries to kill her. With Jacob busy coming to terms with his shape-shifting nature, Bella again finds herself alone, and she returns to seeking thrill-inducing activities.|$|E

The bad news is that now they're free to pick up where they left off on a long-dormant plan that can change the shape of more than one world... and they don't mind using their well-intentioned rescuers to achieve their goals. Kit's long-standing fascination with all things Martian {{unexpectedly}} enmeshes him in <b>a</b> terrible, <b>age-old</b> conflict—turning him into both a possible key to its solution, and a tool that in the wrong hands shortly threatens the whole human race.|$|R

40|$|The {{size of a}} city is {{commonly}} considered decisively to determine {{the nature of its}} problems. While this cannot be denied, this dependence should not be made an absolute. Without a doubt, there are problems inherent in the city as a type of community, that is, in any city, as opposed to a village, a farmstead, or <b>a</b> settlement. <b>Age-old</b> urban problems can be differentiated according {{to the size of the}} cities, and within this process a group of so-called small cities can be separated out. There are several hundred of these in Russia: 884. Within them approximately 28 million persons live, one out of every four citizens. ...|$|R

The two-part name describes its dual nature: AQUA refers to the thermal water in which it grows and DOLOMIAE to the varied dolomite rock through which the thermal water flows underground in Avène. This process originated as pure rain mixed with sea spray rich in mineral salts, then the water filters through porous, mineral filled rocks and comes into contact with micro organism, Aqua Dolomiae.

50|$|Some geopolitical entities, such as nation-states and {{international}} organizations, attempt to relegate the term peacemaking to large, systemic, often factional conflicts {{in which no}} {{member of the community}} can avoid involvement, and in which no faction or segment can claim to be completely innocent of the problems, citing as instances post-genocide situations, or extreme situations of oppression such as apartheid. However peacemaking is <b>a</b> universal and <b>age-old</b> approach to conflict at all levels and among any and all parties, and its principles may be generalized and used in many different kinds of conflicts.|$|R

25|$|Rashid Rida popularized {{the term}} 'Salafī' to {{describe}} a particular movement (i.e., Islamic modernism) that he spearheaded. That movement sought to reject the ossification of the madhhabs, and rethink through the standard issues of fiqh and modernity, at times in very liberal ways. A young scholar {{by the name of}} Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani read an article by Rida, and then took this term and used it {{to describe a}}nother, completely different movement. Ironically, the movement that Rida spearheaded eventually became Modernist Islam and dropped the 'Salafī' label, and the legal methodology that al-Albānī championed – with a very minimal overlap with Rida's vision of Islam – retained the appellation Salafī'. Eventually, al-Albānī's label was adopted by the Najdī daʿwah as well, until it spread in all trends of the movement. Otherwise, before this century, the term 'Salafī' was not used as a common label and proper noun. Therefore, the term 'Salafī' has attached itself to <b>an</b> <b>age-old</b> school of theology, the Atharī school.|$|E

Waktu Batu, by contrast, engages with Javanese history and myth in an abstract, fragmented multi-layered stage idiom, said to express the confusion of young Javanese living amidst <b>a</b> mixture of <b>age-old</b> myths and global cultural influences.
