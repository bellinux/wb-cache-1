40|$|A {{decline in}} the number of people working on farms and in the <b>Annual</b> <b>Work</b> <b>Units</b> per unit area was typical of the second half of the first decade of the 21 st century in the member states of the European Union. Hungary is one of the {{countries}} where this reduction is twice as high as the average. This can be attributed to a number of factors. Of these, the present paper is concerned on the one hand with farm concentration, the low level of farm diversification and pluriactivity and the desire of farmers to expand their farms, and on the other hand with various aspects of the support policy in Hungary aimed at the economic competitiveness and the diversification of the rural economy. The database on which the work was based was taken partly from the digital and printed publications of EUROSTAT and the Hungarian Central Statistical Office (KSH) and partly from surveys of 104 farmers in three microregions of Hungary. Even before the global economic crisis, the factors in question tended to result in a decline in farm employment in Hungary, especially on individual farms. The means and measures embodied in the agricultural and rural policies proved too few and too weak to counterbalance this trend. on-farm employment, farm diversification, farm concentration, support policy, Agricultural and Food Policy, Farm Management, Labor and Human Capital,...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the estimation of productivity and technical progress based on DEA applied to complete panel data (intertemporal-DEA). Instead of assuming unchanged technology, this paper presents a formulation of technical change that allows the decomposition of productivity scores obtained using intertemporal-DEA. The assumption here is that the technology level in period t for each country is the maximum productivity index obtained until this period. The model assumes that improvements over earlier productivity levels are due to technical progress and that productivity scores below the earlier maximum productivity level are due to inefficiency. The methodology is applied to the analysis of agricultural productivity in the European Union regions in the 1985 - 97 period. The major source of data is Cronos in Eurostat. This database is used to obtain the disaggregated outputs, intermediate inputs, and depreciation, in current and constant 1990 prices, and labor in <b>annual</b> <b>work</b> <b>units.</b> Capital is measured by depreciation. Land is agricultural area in hectares. Outputs are aggregated in two categories: crops and animal products. Intermediate inputs are grouped into two major categories: feedstuffs and other materials. Aggregation uses national price indices and regional production structures, using the translog price formula. All output, intermediate input and depreciation data, originally reported in local currencies was converted into ECUs, using the 1990 exchange rates. The discriminatory power of the analysis is higher than those with only contemporary analysis of technical efficiency, giving less than 10 % of observations in the reference set. Further discrimination is explored using super-efficiency analysis. Radial efficiency measures give only a particular form of inefficiency that can be explained by a proportional contraction in input usage. The paper studies particular output and input efficiencies. As examples, animal products inefficiency is usual only in southern regions. Inefficiency in intermediate consumption usage is pervasive, suggesting the possibility of reducing agricultural production costs. Labor and capital inefficiencies arise in different regions. Land slacks are common in the southern and the westernmost regions. ...|$|R

The Association of Pathology Chairs has also collected similar survey data for several years. We examined the Association of Pathology Chairs annual faculty productivity data and compared it with MGMA and FPSC data to understand the value, inherent flaws, and limitations of benchmarking data. We hypothesized that the variability in calculated faculty productivity {{is due to the}} type of practice model and clinical effort allocation. Data from the Association of Pathology Chairs survey on 629 surgical pathologists and/or anatomic pathologists from 51 programs were analyzed. From review of service assignments, we were able to assign each pathologist to a specific practice model: general anatomic pathologists/surgical pathologists, 1 or more subspecialties, or a hybrid of the 2 models. There were statistically significant differences among academic ranks and practice types. When we analyzed our data using each organization’s methods, the median results for the anatomic pathologists/surgical pathologists general practice model compared to MGMA and FPSC results for anatomic and/or surgical pathology were quite close. Both MGMA and FPSC data exclude a significant proportion of academic pathologists with clinical duties. We used the more inclusive FPSC definition of clinical “full-time faculty” (0. 60 clinical full-time equivalent and above). The correlation between clinical full-time equivalent effort allocation, annual days on service, and <b>annual</b> <b>work</b> relative value <b>unit</b> productivity was poor.

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} diversity within organizations, understanding {{the impact of}} ethnic differences in <b>work</b> <b>units</b> has become a strategic imperative. Although the topic of much research, findings regarding the effect of <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> ethnic composition on <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> outcomes are inconsistent. I begin to address inconsistencies in the literature by incorporating the role of two moderators of intergroup contact, status and cooperation (Allport, 1954), into ethnic composition research. First, I introduce the construct of ethnic status, which reflects the degree of status ascribed to individuals based on ethnic group membership, and predict that <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> ethnic status separation (ESS) will negatively impact <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> processes (conflict, cohesion, trust) and performance (financial, manager-rated, citizenship behaviors). Second, I theorize that elements of the <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> (learning climate, performance climate) and community (ethnic composition, economics, political climate) context will moderate <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> ethnic composition effects, such that cooperative contexts ameliorate, but competitive contexts exacerbate, the negative relationship between <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> ESS and unit-level outcomes. In Study 1, I developed a measure of ethnic status and found support for the stability and validity of ethnic status in both student and adult samples. In Study 2, I used the status measure to calculate <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> composition (i. e., ESS). I then tested the interaction of <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> ESS with elements of the <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> and community context {{as a predictor of}} unit-level outcomes in a sample of 703 employees of a large bank, who were nested within 121 geographically dispersed <b>work</b> <b>units</b> (i. e., branches).

40|$|The {{influence}} of farming collectives on income per <b>annual</b> <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> (AWU) is investigated {{by means of}} regressions for three types of farms with animal husbandry. The effects are relatively small, and turn out differently for the three farm types. Whereas the effect is negative for the dairy farms (- 1200 CHF), collective farming {{in the case of}} combined dairying/arable-crop farms and combined pig/poultry farms leads to a higher income (+ 900 and + 500 CHF, respectively). The latter two farm types are characterised by at least two important production branches, unlike the dairy farms, which have just one. The result for the dairy farms, however, does not call the farming collective into question as a growth opportunity. The usual scale effects that can be achieved by setting up a farming collective are markedly greater than the calculated influences on the income of the farming collectives.

40|$|The {{reform of}} <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> (Danwei) system since 1980 s has {{substantially}} influenced spatial structure {{as well as}} people's life style in urban China. How to understand the great transformation of <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> system {{is very important to}} disentangle the socio-economic restructuring processes of Chinese cities. In this paper, we explained the origin, function and transformation of <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> system through literature study and enterprise interview, then we analyze the implication of <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> system reform, as one aspect of institutional changes in China, to people's daily life and urban spatial structure. There has been increasing interests in <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> system and its transformation. The earliest work came from sociological perspective, which has focused on such topics as the origin of <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> and its political-economic background, its organizational structures and power balance, multiple functions of a typical <b>work</b> <b>unit,</b> as well as the dependence of individuals to the <b>work</b> <b>unit.</b> In other words, sociologists pay more attention on the mechanism of <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> system, especially the control and dependence among the state, <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> and individual. Geographers, however, first noticed the role of <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> system through their studies on the urban spatial restructuring. <b>Work</b> <b>unit</b> system and its reform are regarded as the main constraints as well as impetus of the transformation of urban land use and social space. However, up to the present, many studies still remained rather descriptive. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework of <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> studies, while arguing that geographers should and are able to combine the two approaches. <b>Work</b> <b>unit</b> system is a series of institutions and systems of production organization and social control based on <b>work</b> <b>units,</b> which includes two main systems: personnel administration system and welfare system. The former includes authorized staff administration system, employment system, wage system, and employee evaluation and training system. The latter includes housing welfare system, collective consumption system, entertainment welfare system, subsidy system, and social security welfare system. Thus, <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> becomes the "cell" of urban society in China, which not only controls resource allocation and production organization, but is responsible to the social control and social welfare. A <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> is more of a "whole community" than merely a factory or a administrative organization. <b>Work</b> <b>unit</b> system has experienced great transformation since the adoption of the reform and open policy. One fundamental change was the breakdown of the "whole community" of Danwei. Market mechanism was introduced into social production sphere. The organization of <b>work</b> <b>units</b> has gradually been marketized to meet the requirement of market competition. Therefore, social welfare system was gradually separated from <b>work</b> <b>units,</b> i. e. it has been socialized and marketized too. <b>Work</b> <b>units</b> are no longer responsible to the provision of housing, health insurance or other items of social welfare. The reform aimed at <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> system has been one main impetus of the transformation of people's life style and daily life space. Within <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> system, people not only work in Danwei, live in the dwellings allocated as a type of welfare within the Danwei compound (Dayuan). Thus, not only the social relationship, but also the daily life is constrained within Danwei compound. Since the reform, however, individual's dependence to Danwei and <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> system has been weakened. With the breakdown of <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> system, urban residents now have more freedom in choosing jobs and residence. Consequently, job mobility and residential mobility both have been increasing. Home-work relationship has also been greatly shifted, due to the relocation of job opportunities and residences, from home-work proximity to increasingly long-distance commuting. Besides, people's activity space {{is becoming more and more}} extended from <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> compound (Dayuan). For example, our empirical studies on individual shopping space and leisure space have reveal the expansion and differentiation of residents'daily activity spaces of urban China. Urban morphology also experienced substantial restructuring process accompany with the breakdown of <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> system. Urban expansion is now more generated and influenced by urban redevelopment, the construction of industrial parks and residential communities, contrary to the significance of the Danwei construction before the reform. Consequently to the expansion and diversification of people's commuting space, housing search space, and activity space (such as shopping space and leisure space), major cities in China has been facing substantial restructuring. In addition, there has been a more and more apparent trend of urban socio-spatial stratification based on residential location. In the end, we argue that <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> system, although weaken, is still an important factor, to some extent, in urban China, which we call "the concealment of Danwei system". In some cities, residents still expect a "whole community" of Danwei, and Danwei is still the main source of welfare of them. Therefore, <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> system, as well as its transformation continues to be one main perspective of understanding urban China, which requires further studies...|$|R
