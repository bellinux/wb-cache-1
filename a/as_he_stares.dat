2500|$|Davis {{showed little}} {{interest}} in the film Now, Voyager (1942) until Hal Wallis advised her that female audiences needed romantic dramas to distract them from the reality of their lives. It became one of the best known of her [...] "women's pictures".

2500|$|The most {{significant}} {{difference from the}} original play concerned the character of Young Lucius, who {{is a much more}} important figure in the adaptation; he is present throughout Act 1, and retrieves the murder weapon after the death of Mutius; it is his knife which Titus uses to kill the fly; he aids in the capture of Chiron and Demetrius; he is present throughout the final scene. Much as Julie Taymor would do in her 1999 filmic adaptation, Howell set Young Lucius as the centre of the production to prompt the question [...] "What are we doing to the children?" [...] At the end of the play, as Lucius delivers his final speech, the camera stays on Young Lucius rather than his father, who is in the far background and out of focus, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> in horror at the coffin of Aaron's child (which has been killed off-screen). Thus the production became [...] "in part about a boy's reaction to murder and mutilation. We see him losing his innocence and being drawn into this adventure of revenge; yet, at the end we perceive that he retains the capacity for compassion and sympathy." ...|$|E

5000|$|The film {{is notable}} for the catchphrase, [...] "Go ahead, make my day", which is uttered by Clint Eastwood's gun-wielding {{character}} {{in the beginning of}} the film <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> down an armed robber who is holding a hostage. That phrase, although in its Italian localization [...] "Coraggio... fatti ammazzare" [...] ("come on, let me kill you"), was also chosen as the title for the Italian version of the film.|$|E
