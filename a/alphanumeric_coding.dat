North American vehicles that were specially equipped did use special <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>coding</b> for exclusive vehicles like the [...] "SS" [...] designation on Chevrolet products, and Ford used the [...] "GT" [...] term on the high performance version of their products. GM did begin using <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>coding</b> to denote special handling packages installed on performance vehicles, such as [...] "Z28" [...] on the Camaro, the Buick GS, or the Oldsmobile 442, and currently uses the designation [...] "Z71" [...] on the Suburban and Tahoe.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} understanding of measurements {{by students in}} scientific activities that are experimentally based. The study focused on grade 12 high school learners in an urban South African School. The majority of these students were second language English speakers. Data were obtained through a written questionnaire given to students, to explore learners’ ideas about data collection, data processing and data comparison, in particular the need to repeat measurements and the implication of the scatter associated with numerical and graphical data. An <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>coding</b> scheme adapted from Lubben et al. (2000), {{was used as an}} analysis tool. This included categorising responses into point or set paradigms. The findings of this limited study maybe summed up as follows: There is some consistency in reasoning across the experimental phases of data collection and data processing but it was noted that there is little use of set reasoning. It seems that students had specific difficulties in understanding the role and value of statistical tools in assessing confidence in measurement. By and large the learners in this study did not appreciate the need for error analysis. The overall study suggests that though the correct procedures are followed students have little or no understanding of the factors taken into account during data analysis. The findings show that very few students are true set reasoners; 75...|$|E

40|$|The Republic of the Sudan {{is home to}} {{outstanding}} {{and diverse}} cultural heritage ranging from Neolithic sites of human activity and settlement to historic sites of the 19 th and 20 th century. While certain phases of the Sudan’s cultural heritage such as the period of Egyptian influence during the second and first millennium B. C. have {{been the focus of}} archaeological research since the 19 th century, other aspects of the country’s rich history have remained largely unknown locally and internationally {{due to a lack of}} documentation and registration of such sites. Since 2014, the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) has been engaged in an effort to support the creation of a national heritage registry in close cooperation with the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums (NCAM) by digitizing the archive of German architect Friedrich W. Hinkel and engaging in capacity building measures focusing on analog and digital data curation. The archive contains structured information (photos, drawings, maps and assembled written documentation) regarding over 14, 000 archaeological and historical sites in the Sudan using an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>coding</b> system that allows for easy integration of data in a digital environment such as the DAI’s IT infrastructure, the iDAI. world. As such the data assembled by Hinkel will serve as the basis of the national heritage registry currently in development...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Next to {{existing}} terminology {{of the lower}} urinary tract, due to its increasing complexity, the terminology for pelvic floor dysfunction in women may be better updated by a female-specific approach and clinically based consensus report. METHODS: This report combines the input {{of members of the}} Standardization and Terminology Committees of two international organizations, the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA), and the International Continence Society (ICS), assisted at intervals by many external referees. Appropriate core clinical categories and a subclassification were developed to give an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>coding</b> to each definition. An extensive process of 15 rounds of internal and external review was developed to exhaustively examine each definition, with decision-making by collective opinion (consensus). RESULTS: A terminology report for female pelvic floor dysfunction, encompassing over 250 separate definitions, has been developed. It is clinically based with the six most common diagnoses defined. Clarity and user-friendliness have been key aims to make it interpretable by practitioners and trainees in all the different specialty groups involved in female pelvic floor dysfunction. Female-specific imaging (ultrasound, radiology, and MRI) has been a major addition while appropriate figures have been included to supplement and help clarify the text. Ongoing review is not only anticipated but will be required to keep the document updated and as widely acceptable as possible. CONCLUSION: A consensus-based terminology report for female pelvic floor dysfunction has been produced aimed at being a significant aid to clinical practice and a stimulus for research. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Some {{agri-food}} {{managers of}} United States-based companies use strategies to mitigate product-harm crises. The loss of brand and corporate sustainability increases for companies not utilizing mitigating strategies to reduce losses from agri-food product-harm crisis. The {{purpose of this}} multiple case {{study was to explore}} the strategies managers use to mitigate losses from agri-food product-harm crises. Coombs 2 ̆ 7 situational crisis communication theory served as the conceptual framework for this study. A sample of 3 managers from 3 agri-food companies in the southern United States shared their mitigating strategies to reduce losses from a product-harm crisis. Methodological triangulation assisted in reviewing and analyzing information from semistructured interviews, relevant company documents, and journal notes. The use of <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>coding,</b> discovering, and identifying themes, selecting relevant themes, organizing themes in hierarchical order, and linking themes to the phenomenon under study indicated four main themes supporting the benefits of mitigating strategies to reduce losses from an agri-food product-harm crisis. The main themes included the use of pre-crisis mitigating strategies, mid-crisis mitigating strategies, post-crisis mitigating strategies, and high pressure pasteurization (HPP). Findings from this study indicated that agri-food managers use strategies to mitigate product-harm crises, but the added expense of some mitigating strategies often precludes their use. The study findings may contribute to social change by increasing the awareness of agri-food managers, consumers, and company leadership to use mitigating strategies {{to reduce the number of}} illnesses and deaths associated with a product harm crisis...|$|E
