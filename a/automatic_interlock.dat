50|$|NSB-63 {{was based}} on NSB-EB, the very first <b>automatic</b> <b>interlocking</b> system used in Norway. NSB-63 {{is the most common}} system used in Norway, with about 220 {{installed}} interlockings belonging to the Norwegian National Rail Administration. This is more than the combined number of other interlocking systems. About 140 of the systems were installed during the 1960s, with about 80 installed during the 1970s. NSB later developed a series of modified versions of NSI-63, which were installed up until the 1990s. The first development was NSI-63/PLS, which used programmable logic controllers (PLC) instead of telephone relays. Other variations include NSB-78 and NSB-84, which have about 25 and 10 installed units, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Less {{deterioration}} in magnetic properties of laminated cores, {{produced in the}} manufacturing process by <b>automatic</b> <b>interlocking</b> die, is important {{in order to reduce}} energy loss in motors. This report evaluates the influences of shrink fitting on magnetic properties of interlocked ring cores. Core losses increases because of the deformation caused by interlocking and shrink fitting. And then {{it was found that the}} eddy current losses of the ring cores increased due to both the compressive stress in magnetizing direction and the electrically short-circuit between sheets in the interlocking parts, through comparison with the single sheet core losses under the applied compressive stress. Eddy current losses under the compressive stress were discussed using the magnetic domain model. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|R

50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{at the risk of}} his life above and beyond the call of duty. Sgt. Patterson (then Sp4c.) distinguished himself while serving as a fire team leader of the 3d Platoon, Troop B, during an assault against a North Vietnamese Army battalion which was entrenched in a heavily fortified position. When the leading squad of the 3d Platoon was pinned down by heavy <b>interlocking</b> <b>automatic</b> weapon and rocket propelled grenade fire from 2 enemy bunkers, Sgt. Patterson and the 2 other members of his assault team moved forward under a hail of enemy fire to destroy the bunkers with grenade and machine gun fire. Observing that his comrades were being fired on from a third enemy bunker covered by enemy gunners in 1-man spider holes, Sgt. Patterson, with complete disregard for his safety and ignoring the warning of his comrades that he was moving into a bunker complex, assaulted and destroyed the position. Although exposed to intensive small arm and grenade fire from the bunkers and their mutually supporting emplacements. Sgt. Patterson continued his assault upon the bunkers which were impeding the advance of his unit. Sgt. Patterson singlehandedly destroyed by rifle and grenade fire 5 enemy bunkers, killed 8 enemy soldiers and captured 7 weapons. His dauntless courage and heroism inspired his platoon to resume the attack and to penetrate the enemy defensive position. Sgt. Patterson's {{action at the}} risk of his life has reflected great credit upon himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.|$|R
5000|$|He {{elaborated}} in a 1976 interview {{saying it}} was [...] "about Special Forces. It's a rightwing political thriller, a rightwing Costa-Gavras film. It takes place in Texas and involves the Texas Rangers as well. I shouldn't talk about it." [...] However he did describe one scene:There's an operation carried out with peak efficiency where four highly trained specialists wipe out forty men. They don't wipe {{them out in the}} usual sense, because they're so good and heroic. I wanted to give the sense that these four are more than a match for forty because they're so skilled at what they do: use of explosives, <b>automatic</b> weapons fire, <b>interlocking</b> fields of fire. Their planning is so precise and perfect: they're used to thinking this way. When you come away from this battle, you're not just impressed with their skill, but also with how cold they are. Ruthlessly efficient. He also said there was a line in the film [...] "where a Ranger is talking about being in a gunfight with people in a car and the other guy says, [...] "That gun won't stop a car," [...] and the Ranger says, [...] "It will if you shoot it in the driver." [...] That's a Milius line. I'm {{trying to get away from}} that; the rest of the script is very flat. I'm trying to write more mundane now. Rather than dazzle constantly, I'm trying to let the weight of the story carry it, and the more subtle implications of it, letting scenes play themselves out the way they would in reality. We'll see what happens. It's a definite development." [...] The film was to be made in October 1976 in Texas, but Milius instead decided to make Big Wednesday.|$|R
40|$|After the foundering of the Titanic, matters {{regarding}} navigational safety {{began to}} emerge, {{followed by the}} signing of the SOLAS Agreement. Recently, subsidiary agreements on the security against terrorism have also been seen around the 9 &# 822811 incident. Such agreements had begun to encourage international interests concerning the safety and security related matters. As result, most of the countries started forcing themselves to carry out these agreements immediately. For South Korea, this was not a task too difficult to execute since the nation had already been putting major efforts into reinforcing security measures on important national facilities along with establish laws, due to the special militant environment on the Korean Peninsula between the two Koreas. However, not all laws and reinforcements were in harmony, resulting in the need for further institutional adjustments in order for the different agencies and departments to react appropriately to the matters that required coherent and integrated efforts against the Threat to Port security, in particular. The most critical issue in this matter would be the assignment of the full authority of the Port security to a single agent, the Korea Maritime and Port Administration (KMPA). In line with this, the Ministry of Land, Transportation and Maritime Affairs (MLTM) and the regional MPAs should newly establish cells or organizations that are that are solely designated to the Port security while introducing an integrated Port security system to replace the individual efforts on each separate port of responsibility, for enhanced efficiency. This will ideally be supported by additional infra-structure or equipments including infra-red sensors, CCTVs, and <b>automatic</b> alarms <b>interlocked</b> to provide the most effective security measures, backed up by adequate information sharing mechanism with other relevant agencies, such as the Digital Message Handling System (DMHS) Additionally, in consideration of the recent and future redevelopments and the current tendency of the opening of the ports, adequate training for the employees and the consistent mutual international cooperation will be vital in contributing to achieving the ultimate objective of the 'Perfect Port Security'?????쒕줎 1 ?????곌뎄諛곌꼍 1 ?????곌뎄紐⑹쟻 4 ?????곌뎄??諛⑸쾿 諛?援ъ꽦 5 ??????쭔蹂댁븞?꾪삊???대줎??怨좎같 7 ??????쭔蹂댁븞?꾪삊 遺꾩꽍 7 1. ??쭔蹂댁븞?꾪삊??醫낅쪟 7 2. ??쭔蹂댁븞?꾪삊??遺꾩꽍 9 3. ??쭔蹂댁븞?꾪삊???깃꺽 諛??뱀꽦 14 ??????쭔蹂댁븞 愿?젴 援?궡 踰뺣쪧 15 1. ?듯빀諛⑹쐞踰? 15 2. 援???뺣낫?먮쾿 20 3. 援?? ??뀒???쒕룞吏?묠 22 4. ??쭔寃쎈퉬 諛?蹂댁븞愿?━吏?묠 23 5. ??쭔踰? 25 6. 援?젣??빐?좊컯 諛???쭔?쒖꽕??蹂댁븞??愿?븳 踰뺣쪧 27 ????援?젣?곸씤 ?댁뼇蹂댁븞?꾪삊 ??쓳 32 1.

50|$|Sjogren, John C.Rank and organization:Staff Sergeant,Company I, 160th Infantry Regiment, 40th Infantry DivisionPlace and date:Near San Jose Hacienda, Negros, Philippine Islands, May 23, 1945Entered service at:Rockford, MichiganCitation:He led {{an attack}} against a high precipitous ridge defended by a company of enemy riflemen, who were entrenched in spider holes and {{supported}} by well-sealed pillboxes housing <b>automatic</b> weapons with <b>interlocking</b> bands of fire. The terrain was such that only 1 squad could advance at one time; and from a knoll atop a ridge a pillbox covered the only approach with automatic fire. Against this enemy stronghold, S/Sgt. Sjogren led the first squad to open the assault. Deploying his men, he moved forward and was hurling grenades {{when he saw that}} his next in command, at the opposite flank, was gravely wounded. Without hesitation he crossed 20 yards of exposed terrain in the face of enemy fire and exploding dynamite charges, moved the man to cover and administered first aid. He then worked his way forward and, advancing directly into the enemy fire, killed 8 Japanese in spider holes guarding the approach to the pillbox. Crawling to within a few feet of the pillbox while his men concentrated their bullets on the fire port, he began dropping grenades through the narrow firing slit. The enemy immediately threw 2 or 3 of these unexploded grenades out, and fragments from one wounded him in the hand and back. However, by hurling grenades through the embrasure faster than the enemy could return them, he succeeded in destroying the occupants. Despite his wounds, he directed his squad to follow him in a systematic attack on the remaining positions, which he eliminated in like manner, taking tremendous risks, overcoming bitter resistance, and never hesitating in his relentless advance. To silence one of the pillboxes, he wrenched a light machinegun out through the embrasure as it was firing before blowing up the occupants with handgrenades. During this action, S/Sgt. Sjogren, by his heroic bravery, aggressiveness, and skill as a soldier, single-handedly killed 43 enemy soldiers and destroyed 9 pillboxes, thereby paving the way for his company's successful advance. For his heroic act in the war the city of Rockford, Michigan had a day for him. They called it Sjogren day on the date of September 14. After serving the two wars he came home to live in peace. John lost his life to cancer.|$|R
