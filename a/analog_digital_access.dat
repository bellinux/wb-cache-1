40|$|Circuit {{simulation}} {{has proven}} {{to be one of the}} most important computer aided design (CAD) methods for the analysis and validation of integrated circuit designs. A popular approach to describing circuits for simulation purposes is to use a hardware description language such as VHDL. Similar efforts have also been carried out in the analog domain that has led to tools such as SPICE. However, with the growing trend of hardware designs that contain both <b>analog</b> and <b>digital</b> components, design environments that seamlessly integrate <b>analog</b> and <b>digital</b> circuitry are needed. Simulation of such circuits is however, exacerbated by the higher resource (CPU and memory) demands that arise when <b>analog</b> and <b>digital</b> models are integrated in a mixed-mode (<b>analog</b> and <b>digital)</b> simulation. One solution to this problem is to use PDES algorithms on a distributed platform. However, a synchronization interface between the <b>analog</b> and <b>digital</b> simulation environment is required to achieve integrated mixed-mode simu [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> {{converters}} {{are widely}} used in telecommunication systems and instrumentation systems, where wide bandwidth analog input signals need to be converted into medium to high resolution digital signals. A pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> converter is sensitive to distortion introduced by its residue amplifiers, because such distortion leaks into the digital output signal, thus affecting the converter resolution. To reduce distortion, high performance operational amplifiers are usually required {{in the first few}} pipeline stages, but this causes the power consumption, the area occupation and therefore the cost of the converter to increase. An alternative approach is to design low performance operational amplifiers to reduce area and power, and compensate for the distortion they introduce by calibrating the signal in the digital domain. This dissertation presents a new digital background calibration technique called Harmonic Distortion Correction, which allows the estimation and correction of the distortion introduced by residue amplifiers in pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> converters. Implemented in a prototype pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> converter together with another digital calibration technique known in literature as DAC Noise Cancellation, Harmonic Distortion Correction has been proven to facilitate low-voltage operation and to enable reductions in power consumption relative to comparable conventional state-of-the-art pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> converters. Chapter 1 provides a mathematical model for the analysis of the distortion introduced by residue amplifiers in pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> converters, outlines the theory behind the Harmonic Distortion Correction algorithm, and presents the behavioral model of an example pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> converter implementing such technique. Chapter 2 presents a pipelined <b>analog</b> to <b>digital</b> converter integrated circuit prototype implementing Harmonic Distortion Correction and DAC Noise Cancellation, describes the system level and circuit level design issues and solutions, and provides the prototype measurement results...|$|R
