40|$|While {{many studies}} have {{investigated}} the relationship between information <b>systems</b> (IS) characteristics <b>and</b> IS use, {{the results have been}} inconsistent. We argue that this inconsistency {{may be due to the}} modeling of information <b>and</b> <b>system</b> quality <b>and</b> the importance of the system usage context. We extend Wixom and Todd’s (2005) integrated model of IS satisfaction by proposing and modeling information <b>and</b> <b>system</b> quality as second-order constructs and by testing the model in the system administration context. Our findings provide support for modeling information <b>and</b> <b>system</b> quality as second-order constructs in the integrated model. Furthermore, our findings support using additional constructs, unique to the context studied, in the integrated model. We contribute to current literature by 1) enhancing the construct validity of information <b>and</b> <b>system</b> quality, which ultimately improves statistical conclusion validity and internal validity for studies that focus on information <b>and</b> <b>system</b> quality; <b>and</b> 2) testing the extended model in the system administration context. Our findings suggest that future research should measure information quality <b>and</b> <b>system</b> quality as second-order constructs and that including context-specific information <b>and</b> <b>system</b> characteristics provides researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of IS characteristics important in system administration...|$|R

5|$|Crystal Tools entered {{development}} in August 2005 under the code name White Engine. It {{was intended for}} the then PlayStation 3-exclusive role-playing game Final Fantasy XIII. The decision to expand Crystal Tools' compatibility to other game projects <b>and</b> <b>systems</b> marked the official project start for a company-wide engine. Development {{was carried out by}} the Research and Development Division headed by Taku Murata, which was specifically established for this purpose. As Square Enix's biggest project to date, the creation of Crystal Tools caused substantial problems in the simultaneous production of several flagship titles; various critics cited the engine as the primary cause of significant delays in the release of Final Fantasy XIII.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to complex structures <b>and</b> <b>systems,</b> among the phenomena that critics variously claim evolution cannot explain are consciousness, hominid intelligence, instincts, emotions, metamorphosis, photosynthesis, homosexuality, music, language, religion, morality, and altruism (see altruism in animals). Most of these, such as hominid intelligence, instinct, emotion, photosynthesis, language, and altruism, have been well-explained by evolution, while others remain mysterious, or only have preliminary explanations. Supporters of evolution further contend that no alternative explanation {{has been able}} to adequately explain the biological origin of these phenomena either.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber engine mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts <b>and</b> <b>systems</b> designed to reduce it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|E

The fraction of those who die after being hospitalized with TBI fell from almost half in the 1970s to about a quarter {{at the beginning of the}} 21stcentury.
