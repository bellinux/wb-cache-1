5|$|About 190 {{species of}} {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} park have been registered, {{most of which are}} part of the natural composition of the Siberian taiga. Marsh Labrador tea is the most common, the park being one of only three locations in Norway where it occurs. The most common berry plant is lingonberry; common bilberry and bog bilberry are also common, but do not carry good yields of berries. In August there is normally a good yield of cloudberry, and occasionally there can be found <b>Arctic</b> <b>raspberry.</b> There is a limited number of marine plants. The steep cliffs at Revsaksskaret allow mountainous plants to thrive, such as Alpine chickweed, white bluegrass and brittle bladder-fern. These were common throughout the area after the last glacial period, but have vanished with forestation. Other mountainous plants common in the region are not found in Pasvik because of low oxygen levels in the lower soil levels.|$|E
50|$|The {{fruits of}} the <b>Arctic</b> <b>raspberry</b> are very tasty and, among other uses, make jam and liqueur, or flavour tea. Carl von Linné {{considered}} the <b>Arctic</b> <b>raspberry</b> - åkerbär in Swedish - a great delicacy in his Flora Lapponica (1737). Also used in Smirnoff Ice and North, and Lignell & Piispanen's Mesimarjalikööri, and Wine fruit of <b>Arctic</b> <b>RaspBerry</b> (Central Arctic in Adub). <b>Arctic</b> <b>raspberry</b> is the provincial plant of the Norrbotten province of northern Sweden.|$|E

50|$|The Luleå {{archipelago}} {{was described}} by the Swedish bishop Olaus Magnus in 1555. He praised the fair islands, with constant daylight in the summer, well-covered in trees, bushes and grass, with warm but refreshing air, set in a sea that was rich in fish.The islands are rich in wild berries including lingonberries, blueberries, <b>raspberries,</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>raspberries,</b> cloudberries, wild strawberries and seabuckthorn.They have a large and varied bird population.The outer islands are considered more vulnerable, with more sensitive vegetation.|$|R
40|$|Sea {{buckthorn}} (SB) {{has been}} a target of scientific investigations at the University of Turku since 1980 s. In addition to taxonomic, chemical and sensory research of the berries, their health effects have deserved special attention. Nutritional effects of both entire berries and of their oil and ethanol soluble fractions have been investigated. Many of the hypotheses were based on Eastern, especially on Chinese traditions, claims and knowledge. Berries in the Scandinavian countries, both cultivated and wild ones, are commonly regarded as health promoting food ingredients also in Finland. The major genera are Vaccinium (bilberry, lingonberry), Rubus (cloudberry, <b>raspberry,</b> <b>arctic</b> bramble), Ribes (currants), Empetrum (crowberry) and Hippophaë (sea buckthorn). Sea buckthorn berries rich in flavonoids, oil soluble antioxidants and vitamin C were shown to lower concentration of the sensitive CRP in plasma. In addition, consumption of the juice indicated increase of the ratio of HDL cholesterol to LDL cholesterol and elongation of the lag phase of LDL cholesterol oxidation. Berries and especially their ethanol-soluble fraction suppressed the postprandial insulin peak. It was further shown, that the bioavailability of flavonoids was increased by coincide supplementation of sea buckthorn oil. The results of consumption of SB thus indicate possible reduction {{of the risk of}} cardiovascular diseases in healthy people. Sea buckthorn seed and pulp oils have been of special interest. The very recent studies showed the unexceptionally high protective, antioxidative effects of SB oils on the isolated DNA in vitro. The same was the case with DNA of rat liver homogenate in vitro. Whether the positive effects of sea buckthorn oils on dry eyes and atopic skin have the same mechanistic background, is not known. The oils investigated have all been isolated by aseptic CO 2 extraction. vokTyrnimarjan terveysvaikutukset: Kymmenen tutkimuksen tulokset Turun yliopistost...|$|R
50|$|Dried fruits {{used in the}} {{preparation}} of Swedish fruit soup have included apricot, apple, pear, raisins, currant cranberries, prunes grapes, cherry cloudberry, <b>arctic</b> <b>raspberry</b> and peaches. Additional ingredients may include tapioca, sago, red wine, sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, and salt. Preparation involves soaking the dried fruits and various ingredients for some time to soften them, and then adding water and cooking the mixture until it thickens.|$|E
50|$|In 1783, a {{distillery}} {{was built}} {{in place of the}} current factory. In 1856, O.W. Roering's vodka distillery was founded in the same area, and two years later it was bought by brandy and rum importer Gustav Ranin. In 1872, pharmacists Lignell and Piispanen started manufacturing <b>Arctic</b> <b>raspberry</b> liqueur and other alcoholic beverages. The production ended in 1919 because of the prohibition, and when the prohibition was repelled in 1932, Lignell and Piispanen's alcohol manufacture was sold to Gustav Ranin. In 1985, a new factory was built for the company.|$|E
50|$|Paramushir has a sub-arctic climate {{strongly}} modulated by {{the cooling}} {{effects of the}} North Pacific Oyashio Current. The arboreal flora of Paramushir is consequently limited to dense, stunted copses of Siberian dwarf pine and shrubby alder. The alpine tundra which dominates the landscape produces plentiful edible mushrooms and berries, especially lingonberry, <b>Arctic</b> <b>raspberry,</b> whortleberry and crowberry. Red fox, Arctic hare and ermine are notably abundant and hunted by the inhabitants. The island also supports a population of brown bears. In the spring crested auklet nest on the island. The straits between Paramushir and Shumshu island support a notably dense population of sea otters; harbor seals are also common.|$|E

This allowed a small area to place more than 70 taxa of traditional and new for Karelia fruit and berry crops. In {{the center of the}} exhibition - decorative Malus prunifolia 'Hyvingiensis' with an umbrella form crown. Among the new crop of Karelia - raspberry (Rubus xanthocarpus Bur et Franch.), Tibetan raspberries (Rubus rosifolius Sm.), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.), variety selection of Finnish <b>Arctic</b> <b>raspberry</b> (Rubus arcticus L.) and currants, columnar apple trees, apple trees in semi-dwarf rootstocks, ornamental varieties of fruit and others...|$|E
