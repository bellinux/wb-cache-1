5|$|International {{tensions}} grew in {{the late}} 1930s. Crises were caused by the German occupation of the Rhineland in 1936; the Anschluss and Sudeten crisis of 1938; and the German occupation of Bohemia and Moravia and the Italian invasion of Albania {{in the spring of}} 1939. These events forced the Dutch government to exercise greater vigilance, but they limited their reaction <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> The most important measure was a partial mobilisation of 100,000 men in April 1939.|$|E
5|$|During {{the march}} through {{vineyards}} and cornfields, the emaciated children ate <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> Lukić {{states that the}} Partisans rested the remaining children at Žumberak for a day, before arranging {{for them to be}} transferred across the Kupa river into liberated areas of the Bosanska Krajina. According to one survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, some of the children who were liberated from the camp by the Partisans inAugust 1942 were placed with families in the Žumberak district and were subsequently re-captured by the Ustaše. Some were killed and others were returned to the camp.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners {{realised}} that if {{they managed}} to fully counterfeit the dollars, their lives {{would no longer be}} safeguarded by the work they were undertaking, so they slowed their progress <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> The journalist Lawrence Malkin, who wrote a history of Operation Bernhard, writes that prisoners considered this to have the tacit approval of Krüger, who would face front-line duty if Operation Bernhard ended. In August 1944 Salomon Smolianoff, a convicted forger, was added to the production team at Sachsenhausen to aid the counterfeiting of US dollars, although he also assisted in quality control for the pound notes. The Jewish prisoners working on the operation at the time complained to Krüger at having to work with a criminal, so he was given his own room to sleep in.|$|E

5|$|A {{second group}} of 770 {{children}} from Stara Gradiška followed on 13–14July, while a third, consisting of another 850 children were transported from the Adriatic coastal village of Jablanac {{at the end of}} the month. On 5August, 800 more children arrived from the concentration camp at Mlaka. The last group arrived from the nearby village of Gornja Reka on 14August with 150 children, all boys. In total, 3,136 children arrived at the camp up to 14August. According to the historian Dragoje Lukić, a total of 3,336 children passed through the camp during its existence, aged between one and fourteen years old. One survivor, Dušanka Šmitran, who had previously been held at one of the sub-camps of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex, stated that she was dragged away from her mother at the sub-camp and they were packed tightly into railway wagons for the journey. On arrival in Zagreb, she said they were taken to the Croatian Red Cross building where they were washed, had their hair cut, and were allowed to eat <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> She remarked that this was the only time such things occurred during her time in the Ustaše camps.|$|E
5|$|The first open {{clash between}} the mutineers and {{officers}} {{came on the}} morning of 3 December, when a small group of sailors gathered on the forecastle and, refusing orders to leave, began to argue with the officers. Captain Eyles asked to know their demands, which were an assurance that Temeraire would not go to the West Indies, but instead would return to England. Eventually Rear Admiral Campbell came down to speak to the men, and having informed them that the officers did not know the destination of the ship, he ordered them to disperse. The men went below decks and the incipient mutiny appeared to have been quashed. The ringleaders, numbering around a dozen, remained determined however, and made discreet inquiries among the rest of the crew. Having eventually determined {{that the majority of the}} crew would, if not actually support a mutiny, at least not oppose it, and that the Temeraires crew would be supported by the ship's marines as well as the crews of some of the other warships in Bantry Bay, they decided to press ahead with their plans. The mutiny began with the crew closing the ship's gunports, effectively barricading themselves below deck. Having done so, they refused orders to open them again, jeered the officers and threatened violence. The crew then came up on deck and once again demanded to know their destination and refused to obey orders to sail for anywhere but England. Having presented their demands they returned below decks and resumed the usual shipboard routine <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{practice}} was replaced in 1900 by {{a far more}} complex system of assessments and donations designed {{to raise the money}} to support strikes. This system was replaced in 1901 because it was impractical. The 1901 system required every local union and the central committee to create strike funds. Local unions would receive support for strikes from Berlin under certain circumstances, and the central Business Committee's fund would be replenished by all member organizations in amounts proportional to their membership and the average wage of their members. This system, too, proved problematic because it penalized the larger, wealthier unions— especially the construction workers in Berlin who had higher wages but also higher costs of living. From 1901 to 1903, many small organizations joined the federation, yet the FVdG's membership fell as the punitive strike support system drove some larger unions out. In 1903, the federation not only changed its name to the Free Association of German Trade Unions but also decided to return to the old system of voluntary contributions. This system remained in place until 1914. The Business Committee worked to ensure that unions contributed <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> Often the committee resorted to threatening unions with expulsion in order to raise funds for a strike. Fritz Kater called this a dictatorship necessary for the movement, but local organizations still had far more autonomy than their counterparts in other German labor federations.|$|E

During this period, she often repelled enemy kamikazes as the Japanese tried desperately but vainly to stem the mounting tide of defeat.

25|$|While it {{is certain}} that the Vichy {{government}} and a large number of its high administration collaborated in the implementation of the Holocaust, the exact level of such cooperation is still debated. Compared with the Jewish communities established in other countries invaded by Germany, French Jews suffered proportionately lighter losses (see Jewish death toll section above); although, starting in 1942, repression and deportations struck French Jews as well as foreign Jews. Former Vichy officials later claimed that they did <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> to minimize the impact of the Nazi policies, although mainstream French historians contend that the Vichy regime went beyond the Nazi expectations.|$|E

Even so, the Indiamen were heavily armed {{so that they could}} dissuade Malay pirates and even large privateers. They were not designed, however, to fight naval ships as their ports were small and so the guns could only fire directly out. Furthermore, even the largest guns were smaller than those that naval vessels commonly carried. Still, from their appearance in the distance, or in the dark, it was possible to mistake them for ships of the line, as Exeters own history proved.|$|E

The band worked for a third time with Trombino, who agreed to defer payment until after the album's release in order to keep costs down. Some of the drum tracks were recorded at Cherokee, and then the band moved to Doug Messenger's harddrive analog and digital in North Hollywood, where five weeks of tracking completed the recording phase. Trombino then mixed the record at Extasy in Hollywood.|$|E

25|$|When World War II broke out, Walton {{began working}} for Time magazine. Walton met {{journalist}} Mary Welsh while they both worked for Time in England. Although {{he liked her}} and enjoyed her writing, he felt she lacked insight into the deeper meaning of the events she was covering. When Walton received permission to parachute into Normandy on D-Day and was training for the jump, Welsh invited him to a May 24 party at the London apartment of Robert Capa, the Hungarian war photographer. Capa had also invited Ernest Hemingway to the party. Although Welsh was not present, a mutual friend of hers introduced Walton to Hemingway. Hemingway and Walton soon became good friends, in part because Hemingway was fascinated by Walton's forthcoming parachute jump. Walton parachuted into France with the 82nd Airborne Division on June 6. Hemingway gained access to liberated France shortly thereafter. When Walton was staying in Cherbourg in mid-July, Hemingway visited him numerous times under the pretense of bringing him his mail. Hemingway, Capa, and Walton also spent a week at newly liberated Mont Saint-Michel in August 1944, drinking and eating <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> Hemingway and Walton accompanied one another during {{the first phase of}} the Battle of Hürtgen Forest in September and October 1944. They even shared a double-bed.|$|E

[...] Instead, he chose to explain each scene in great detail just before starting to shoot takes, reciting the dialog from memory only one time, so that when the camera was rolling the actors had to try to remember <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> of what he had told them and then improvise {{to the best of their}} ability what they had forgotten or only half-understood.
