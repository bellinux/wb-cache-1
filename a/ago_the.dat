5|$|By about 15,000 years ago, Equus ferus was a {{widespread}} holarctic species.

The reasons for this extinction are not fully known, but one theory notes that extinction in North America paralleled human arrival.

5|$|Aboriginal genetic {{studies suggest}} that the first {{inhabitants}} of the Americas share a single ancestral population, one that developed in isolation, conjectured to be Beringia. The isolation of these peoples in Beringia might have lasted 10,000–20,000 years.

5|$|Continents formed, {{then broke}} up and {{reformed}} as {{the surface of}} Earth reshaped over {{hundreds of millions of}} years, occasionally combining to make a supercontinent.

5|$|Ice ages {{during the}} Pleistocene brought a cooler and wetter pluvial climate {{to the region}} {{starting}} 2 to 3million years <b>ago.</b> <b>The</b> added precipitation increased runoff and the erosive ability of streams (especially from spring melt water and flash floods in summer).

5|$|Eruptions {{along the}} narrow fissure system under the chain began in the west moat of Long Valley Caldera 400,000 to 60,000 years ago. Mammoth Mountain was formed during this period.
