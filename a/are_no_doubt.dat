25|$|You cannot surely mean {{to degrade}} the Joan of Arc into a pot girl. You are not going, I hope, to annex to that most splendid {{ornament}} of Southey's poem all this cock and a bull story of Joan the publican's daughter of Neufchatel, with the lamentable episode of a waggoner, his wife, and six children; the texture {{will be most}} lamentably disproportionate. The first forty or fifty lines of these addenda <b>are,</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> in their way, admirable, too; but many would prefer the Joan of Southey.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reasons for}} this <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> complex, but one factor that is {{commonly}} cited is the suppression of protest movements by the conservative leaders of those countries. A report by Asef Bayat in the Middle East Report suggests that [...] "the Arab governments allow little room for independent dissent" [...] as is shown {{by the fact that}} [...] "Since 2000, demands for collective protests against the US and Israel have been ignored by the authorities" [...] and [...] "unofficial street actions have faced intimidation and assault, with activists being harassed or detained".|$|E

6000|$|But I think I {{know what}} startles you. It is the {{being asked to}} believe in such an {{enormous}} change in climate, and in {{the height of the}} land above the sea. Well--it is very astonishing, appalling--all but incredible, if we had not the facts to prove it. But of the facts there can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt.</b> There can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that the climate of this northern hemisphere has changed enormously more than once. [...] There can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that the distribution of land and water, the shape and size of its continents and seas, have changed again and again. There can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that, for instance, long before the age of ice, the whole North of Europe was much warmer than it is now.|$|R
2500|$|While {{the drum}} {{is central to}} pow wows, [...] "the drum only helps them keep beat. Dancers key on the melody of the song. Rhythms, tones, pitch all help create their 'moves'." [...] (p.85) Note that Bill Runs Above {{did not mention the}} lyrics of the songs, and while they <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> important, most lyrics of most songs employ vocables, {{syllable}} sounds such as [...] "ya", [...] "hey", and [...] "loi" [...] (p.86). This is particularly evident in intertribal songs, such as the AIM Song, which cannot be biased towards a certain language.|$|E
2500|$|In Section II, Justice Roberts {{acknowledged}} the [...] "undeniable" [...] historic {{accomplishments of the}} Voting Rights Act. [...] However, the Act [...] "now raises serious constitutional concerns." [...] In particular, §5, [...] "which authorizes federal intrusion into sensitive areas {{of state and local}} policymaking, imposes substantial 'federalism costs,' [...] " [...] costs which [...] have caused Members of this Court to express serious misgivings about the constitutionality of §5. [...] Meanwhile, some of the conditions that the Court relied upon when it previously upheld this statutory scheme have unquestionably improved. [...] "Those improvements <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> due in significant part to the Voting Rights Act itself, and stand as a monument to its success," [...] but the Act imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs. The Act also differentiates between the States in ways that may no longer be justified.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} note affinities between Zechariah 9–14 and the Book of Malachi. Zechariah 9, Zechariah 12, and Malachi 1 are all {{introduced as}} The word of Elohim. Many {{scholars argue that}} this collection originally consisted of three independent and anonymous prophecies, two of which were subsequently appended to the Book of Zechariah (as what scholars refer to as Deutero-Zechariah) with the third becoming the Book of Malachi. As a result, most scholars consider the Book of Malachi to {{be the work of}} a single author {{who may or may not}} have been identified by the title Malachi. The present division of the oracles results in a total of twelve books of minor prophets—a number parallelling the sons of Jacob who became the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel. The Catholic Encyclopedia asserts that [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> in presence of an abbreviation of the name Mál'akhîyah, that is Messenger of Elohim.|$|E

2500|$|The most disputed {{point about}} the origin of the Brahmi script has long been whether it was a purely {{indigenous}} development or was borrowed or derived from scripts that originated outside India. Goyal noted that most proponents of the indigenous view are Indian scholars, whereas the idea of borrowing or influence from some non-Indian (typically Semitic) script are mostly Western scholars, and Salomon agrees with Goyal that there <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> biases – nationalist or imperialistic – {{on both sides of the}} debate. Bühler curiously cited a passage by Sir Alexander Cunningham, one of the earliest indigenous origin proponents, that indicated that, in his time, the indigenous origin was a preference of English scholars in opposition to the [...] "unknown Western" [...] origin preferred by continental scholars. Cunningham in the seminal Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum of 1877 speculated that Brahmi characters were derived from, among other things, a pictographic principle based on the human body, but Bühler noted that by 1891, Cunningham considered the origins of the script uncertain.|$|E
2500|$|The rest of {{the scene}} is {{populated}} with doughty and good-humoured English workers. It is George II's birthday (30 October) (indicated by the flag flying on the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields in the background) and {{the inhabitants of the}} scene <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> toasting his health. Under the sign of the Barley Mow, a blacksmith or cooper sits with a foaming tankard {{in one hand and a}} leg of beef in the other. Together with a butcher—his steel hangs at his side—they laugh with the pavior (sometimes identified as a drayman) as he courts a housemaid (the key she holds is a symbol of domesticity). Ronald Paulson suggests a parallel between the trinity of signs of ill-omen in Gin Lane, the pawnbroker, distiller, and undertaker, and the trinity of English [...] "worthies" [...] here, the blacksmith, pavior, and butcher. Close by a pair of fish-sellers rest with a pint and a porter sets down his load to refresh himself. In the background, two men carrying a sedan chair pause for drink, while the passenger remains wedged inside, her large hoop skirt pinning her in place. On the roof, the builders, who are working on the publican's house above the [...] "Sun" [...] tavern share a toast with the master of a tailor's workshop. In this image it is a barrel of beer that hangs from a rope above the street, in contrast to the body of the barber in Gin Lane.|$|E
2500|$|From Josiah Gregg's journal, Commerce of the Prairies: [...] "Of all {{the prairie}} animals, {{by far the}} most curious, and by no means the least celebrated, is the little prairie dog. ...The flesh, though often eaten by travelers, is not esteemed savory. It was {{denominated}} the 'barking squirrel', the 'prairie ground-squirrel', etc., by early explorers, with much more apparent propriety than the present established name. Its yelp, which resembles that of the little toy-dog, seems its only canine attribute. It rather appears to occupy a middle ground betwixt the rabbit and squirrel—like the former in feeding and burrowing — like the latter in frisking, flirting, sitting erect, and somewhat so in its barking. The prairie dog has been reckoned by some naturalists a species of the marmot (arctomys ludoviciana); yet it seems to possess scarce any other quality in common with this animal except that of burrowing. ...I have the concurrent testimony of several persons, who have been upon the Prairies in winter, that, like rabbits and squirrels, they issue from their holes every soft day; and therefore lay up no doubt a hoard of 'hay' (as there is rarely anything else {{to be found in the}} vicinity of their towns) for winter's use. A collection of their burrows has been termed by travelers a 'dog town,' which comprises from a dozen or so, to some thousands in the same vicinity; often covering an area of several square miles. They generally locate upon firm dry plains, coated with fine short grass, upon which they feed; for they <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> exclusively herbivorous. But even when tall coarse grass surrounds, they seem commonly to destroy this within their 'streets,' which are nearly always found 'paved' with a fine species suited to their palates. They must need but little water, if any at all, as their 'towns' are often, indeed generally, found in the midst of the most arid plains—unless we suppose they dig down to subterranean fountains. At least they evidently burrow remarkably deep. Attempts either to dig or drown them out of their holes have generally proved unsuccessful. Approaching a 'village,' the little dogs may be observed frisking about the 'streets'—passing from dwelling to dwelling apparently on visits—sometimes a few clustered together as though in council—here feeding upon the tender herbage—there cleansing their 'houses,' or brushing the little hillock about the door—yet all quiet. Upon seeing a stranger, however, each streaks it to its home, but is apt to stop at the entrance, and spread the general alarm by a succession of shrill yelps, usually sitting erect. Yet at the report of a gun or the too near approach of the visitor, they dart down and are seen no more till the cause of alarm seems to have disappeared.|$|E
