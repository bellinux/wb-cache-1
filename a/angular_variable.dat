40|$|The {{asymptotic}} {{behavior of a}} nonlinear oscillator subject to a multiplicative Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise is investigated. When the dynamics is {{expressed in terms of}} energy-angle coordinates, it is observed that the angle is a fast variable as compared to the energy. Thus, an effective stochastic dynamics for the energy can be derived if the <b>angular</b> <b>variable</b> is averaged out. However, the standard elimination procedure, performed earlier for a Gaussian white noise, fails when the noise is colored because of correlations between the noise and the fast <b>angular</b> <b>variable.</b> We develop here a specific averaging scheme that retains these correlations.

40|$|Restricting {{the states}} of a charged {{particle}} to the lowest Landau level introduces a noncommutativity between Cartesian coordinate operators. This idea is extended to the motion of a charged particle on a sphere {{in the presence of}} a magnetic monopole. Restricting the dynamics to the lowest energy level results in noncommutativity for <b>angular</b> <b>variables</b> and to a definition of a noncommuting spherical product. The values of the commutators of various <b>angular</b> <b>variables</b> are not arbitrary but are restricted by the discrete magnitude of the magnetic monopole charge.
