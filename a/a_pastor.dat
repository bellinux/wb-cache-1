He became an itinerant preacher as an adult, working at churches throughout Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, then settled down as <b>a</b> <b>pastor</b> in Philadelphia, eventually opening a large church called Tindley Temple United Methodist Church.|$|E

5|$|Most {{churches in}} the {{prosperity}} movement are non-denominational and independent, though some groups have formed networks. Prosperity churches typically reject Presbyterian polity (or governance) {{and the idea that}} <b>a</b> <b>pastor</b> should be accountable to elders; it is common for pastors of prosperity churches to be the highest organizational authority figure. Critics, including Sarah Posner and Joe Conason, maintain that prosperity teachers cultivate authoritarian organizations. They argue that leaders attempt to control the lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority. Jenkins contends that prosperity theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of pastors.|$|E

5|$|After {{more than}} five years at Wells, Wheelwright {{received}} an invitation from the church and town of Hampton, then under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, to join the Reverend Timothy Dalton as <b>a</b> <b>pastor</b> of the church there. Without apparent hesitation he went there in the spring of 1647 and entered into a written agreement with a committee of the church and town. He was installed as the minister on 12 April 1647 by some accounts, or 24 June 1647 by another. The job afforded the 55-year-old Wheelwright with a larger salary than the parish at Wells did, an important consideration given the large size of his family. No longer in a frontier setting, he was now within reach of professional brethren and laymen of culture and social refinement, more aligned with his educational background.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{assumptions}} about what <b>a</b> <b>pastor's</b> care is.

5|$|Euler's formal {{education}} started in Basel, {{where he was}} sent to live with his maternal grandmother. In 1720, aged thirteen, he enrolled at the University of Basel, and in 1723, he received a Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of Descartes and Newton. During that time, he was receiving Saturday afternoon lessons from Johann Bernoulli, who quickly discovered his new pupil's incredible talent for mathematics. At that time Euler's main studies included theology, Greek, and Hebrew at his father's urging in order to become <b>a</b> <b>pastor,</b> but Bernoulli convinced his father that Leonhard was destined to become a great mathematician.|$|E
