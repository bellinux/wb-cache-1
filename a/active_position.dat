40|$|Although {{mutual fund}} {{performance}} has been dissected from almost every angle, very {{little attention has}} been paid to the connection between the actual active decisions made by management and the subsequent performance outcomes. In this paper we use information on institutional mutual funds to examine the implications of their active decisions made with respect to <b>active</b> <b>positions,</b> style and cash holdings for the fund's realised alpha, tracking error and information ratio. We identify some areas where the funds across the entire sample have success (<b>active</b> <b>positions,</b> and growth and winning stock divergences) and many others where they fall short (e. g. value and loser stock divergences). We identify that there is significant variation in these findings when we extend our analysis to examine the impact of these active decisions on performance for different styles of funds during periods of weak and strong markets. Value funds prove to be by far the best in the <b>active</b> <b>positions</b> that they make but losing across the board with their style divergences. Finally, we highlight the importance in style choice on the overall performance of a fund and identify the superiority of the value style over its competitors. ...|$|R

25|$|Six {{days after}} {{breaking}} Bob Boone's all-time games caught record, Fisk was abruptly {{released by the}} Chicago White Sox. Fisk was notified of his dismissal {{in his hotel room}} in Cleveland while on a road trip with the team. It is reported that he was ordered to turn in his equipment and fly back to Chicago immediately, and alone. Fisk was one of two final <b>active</b> <b>position</b> players in the 1990s who had played in the 1960s. The other was Nolan Ryan. He is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in MLB games in four decades.|$|E
25|$|The Schiller Piano Company, {{which was}} {{historically}} the largest industry in Ogle County, was founded around 1890. When founded, {{the company was}} located at {{the northwest corner of}} Oregon's Second and Washington Streets. The Schiller Piano Company was started using money from Oregon resident and the first president of the company, F.G. Jones. Jones was not active in the company's management until 1895 when he reportedly left his well-established mercantile business to take an <b>active</b> <b>position</b> at the piano company as general manager and president of the factory. Sources conflict as to whether Jones actually left his mercantile interests behind, which included work {{as the president of the}} Oregon Electric Light and Power Company and Oregon Machine and Foundry. In addition the Schiller Company owned an interest in the Power Company and two Jones sons, George H. and Edgar B., held management positions with the firm.|$|E

[...] "Automatically capturing video and audio unburdens the user from the need to manually turn on the device during a dangerous situation. This is critical and guarantees {{there will always be}} a record of the TASER firing." [...] Designed to be interchangeable between the Taser X26 or Taser X2, the camera records both video and audio automatically each time the Taser is armed (when the safety is moved into the up or <b>active</b> <b>position).</b> There is no interference to the normal function of the Taser; it is still fully functional while the camera is in operation. This innovation coupled with the data port download kit allows for the automatic archiving of critical events for law enforcement agencies.|$|E
40|$|People {{belonging}} to cancer patient support groups participated in focus groups concerning their experiences of orthodox and complementary medicine. Their accounts of treatment decisions for cancer were analysed through discourse analysis. Accounts of both complementary and orthodox medicine addressed an ideological dilemma concerning the positioning of individuals as active or passive. <b>Active</b> <b>positions</b> were {{congruent with the}} everyday value of autonomy and responsible individuality, but conflicted with the established expertise of the medical profession in cancer and entailed being accountable for one’s health. Passive positions reversed this situation. Complementary medicine provided an opportunity for people with cancer to negotiate <b>active</b> <b>positions</b> in a limited domain of health care. The responsibility for health associated with taking active treatment decisions was problematic in accounts of both orthodox and complementary medicine...|$|R

2500|$|With rising {{tension between}} North and South, President Abraham Lincoln {{was elected in}} December, 1860. Governor Thomas Overton Moore {{appointed}} Hébert to the military board to reorganize militia and defenses in the New Orleans area. He was appointed as a Colonel of the 1st Louisiana Artillery. After secession on April 1, 1861 Hébert was appointed a Brigadier General in the Louisiana Militia. [...] In August, he was Commissioned a Brigadier General in the provisional Army of the Confederacy but was not given an <b>active</b> <b>position.</b> Later {{he would have a}} command of Louisiana troops and in the Trans-Mississippi Department.

2500|$|The T877A, W741L and W741C {{mutations}} [...] {{are examples}} of known AR LBD mutations. The LNCaP prostate cancer cell line expresses AR with a T877A point mutation that causes proliferation {{in the presence of}} the antiandrogens hydroxyflutamide and cyproterone acetate. This mutation has also been discovered in patients with antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome being treated with these compounds. In another study, bicalutamide treatment of LNCaP cells resulted in two LBD mutations, W741L and W741C, causing bicalutamide to acquire agonist activity to both mutant ARs. The W741L mutation generates additional space such that the sulfonyl-linked phenyl ring of bicalutamide is accommodated at the location of the missing indole ring of W741. In non-mutant AR, the presence of the W741 side chain probably forces bicalutamide to protrude out thus precluding the <b>active</b> <b>position</b> of H12 on the AR receptor.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1962, Sweden joined {{seven other}} neutral countries, {{members of the}} Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament, a {{predecessor}} to the Conference on Disarmament (CD). In 1968, Sweden signed the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) and thereby publicly committed itself against [...] the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Shortly after joining the NPT, Sweden became {{a founding member of}} the Zangger Committee, which was designed to work out the exact definitions of the material and equipment to be restricted by the NPT. The Committee drafted a “Trigger List” of [...] "source or special fissionable materials" [...] and [...] "equipment or materials specially designed or prepared for the processing, use, or production of fissile materials". [...] In continuation, Sweden has occupied an <b>active</b> <b>position</b> in generating of new agreements that would control the export of the listed items to non-NPT states. These agreements and Trigger List have subsequently constituted the first major agreement on nuclear export regulations.|$|E

40|$|<b>Active</b> <b>positioning</b> and microvibration {{control has}} been {{attempted}} by electromagnets equipped in a bellows-type, air-spring vibration isolation system. Performance tests {{have been carried}} out to study the effects. The main components of the system's isolation table were four electromagnetic actuators and controllers. The vibration isolation table was also equipped with six acceleration sensors for detecting microvibration of the table. The electromagnetic actuators were equipped with bellows-type air springs for passive support of the weight of the item placed on the table, with electromagnets for <b>active</b> <b>positioning,</b> as well as for microvibration control, and relative displacement sensors. The controller constituted a relative feedback system for positioning control and an absolute feedback system for vibration isolation control. In the performance test, a 1, 490 kg load (net weight of 1, 820 kg) was placed on the vibration isolation table, and both the positioning and microvibration control were carried out electromagnetically. Test results revealed that the vibration transmission was reduced by 95 %...|$|R
