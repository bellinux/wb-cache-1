5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we {{have done in the past}}... I wanted to try and take everything we have done in the past and put it to the side.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> captures a {{commanding}} piece (the general 将, governor 帥, middle troop 中軍, or banner 旗) promotes on the spot.|$|E
25|$|Enameled {{cast iron}} cooking vessels {{are made of}} cast iron covered with a {{porcelain}} surface. This creates <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> has the heat distribution and retention properties of cast iron combined with a non-reactive, low-stick surface.|$|E

25|$|If <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> cannot retreat or move aside {{advances}} {{across the}} board until {{it can no longer}} move, it must remain there until captured. This applies to the pawn, lance, stone general, wood general, and iron general.|$|E
25|$|Pieces are {{arranged}} in this section so that, if they promote, they promote into the piece above them. Piece names with a grey background are present {{at the start of}} the game; those with a blue background only appear with promotion. Betza's funny notation has been included in brackets for easier reference, with the extension that the notation xxxayyyK stands for an xxxK move possibly followed by an yyyK move, not necessarily in the same direction. Larger numbers of 'legs' can be indicated by repeated application of 'a', or by numbers: thus a3K means <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> can take up to three steps of a king. By default continuation legs can go into all directions, but can be restricted to a single line by a modifier 'v' ("vertical", interpreted relative to the piece's current position on its path). The default modality of all legs is the ability to move and capture: other possibilities are specified explicitly. Thus mKa3K means <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> takes up to three steps of a king, but must stop when it first captures. Square brackets are used to make it clear what legs the a modifier chains together: thus DaK would denote a dabbaba move followed by a king move, but D would denote <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> can move as a dabbaba, or twice as a king.|$|E
25|$|If <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> cannot retreat or move aside {{advances}} {{across the}} board until {{it can no longer}} move, it must remain there until captured. This applies to the pawn, lance, ram’s-head soldier, stone general, wood general, and iron general upon reaching the farthest rank, and to the knight upon reaching either of the two farthest ranks.|$|E

50|$|The single Night at the Café Montarto (2013), is <b>a</b> jazz <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> {{emerged from}} <b>a</b> piano improvisation.|$|R
25|$|Direction of {{movement}} is indicated via an operator symbol. A plus sign {{is used to}} indicate forward movement. A minus sign is used to indicate backwards movement. A dot or period or equal sign is used to indicate horizontal or lateral movement. For <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> moves diagonally (such as the horse or elephant), the plus or minus sign is used rather than the period.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} voting, ESPN.com, the Internet arm of American sports {{broadcasting}} giant ESPN, published <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> partially linked Qatar's successful bid to Football Dreams, a youth development program {{that the country}} has bankrolled since 2005. At the time of bidding, Football Dreams operated in 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia—six of which had representatives on the FIFA executive committee.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 Allen guest curated a video {{screening}} at 176 London, Zabludowicz Collection. The event featured Allen's 2006 video work Happy Christmas Mom & Dad, <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> sees Allen allegedly {{perform a}} seductive dance {{as a gift}} for her parents on Christmas Day. It was subsequently reviewed by Jane Neal for Saatchi Online The screening at Zabludowicz Collection also included video works by Peter Land the Visual Artist, Pipilotti Rist , Gilbert & George , and Carolee Schneemann.|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} <b>a</b> public affairs <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> strives {{to present a}} broad scope {{of the town of}} McMinnville. This project is divided into two pieces: {{personality}} profiles of business owners who live and work in various fields in the community, and <b>a</b> summative <b>piece</b> <b>that,</b> also through interviews, provides a broader representation of the town of McMinnville...|$|R

5000|$|Hardships {{politically}} radicalized Sam Faubus, and in {{his older}} days he reminisced, [...] "I worked in my younger days as a tiemaker—not the wearing kind, but the kind that railroads use. I made them for 10 cents <b>a</b> <b>piece.</b> <b>That's</b> why I became a liberal. I don't like slave labor, and that's just what it was." ...|$|R
25|$|In the Museum of Automata in the Tibidabo Amusement Park in Barcelona, {{there is}} <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> recreates the {{execution}} of Dr. Crippen. The machine dates from 1921 and is fully operational. A waxwork of Crippen {{can be seen in}} the Chamber of Horrors at Madame Tussauds in London. During the Dogger Bank earthquake of 1931 which was the strongest earthquake recorded in the United Kingdom, the head of his waxwork fell off.|$|E
25|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that Gorsky interpolated the Grand Pas des toréadors from the 1881 Petipa/Minkus ballet Zoraiya, <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> is still included in modern productions of Don Quixote. However, this piece was already in Don Quixote by the time Gorsky came to revive it as it was found published in the ballet score in 1882. Therefore, the likelihood {{is that it was}} actually Petipa himself who interpolated the Grand Pas des toréadors in Don Quixote.|$|E
25|$|At Chidambaram, {{the dancer}} dominates, not the linga {{as in other}} Shiva shrines. The Chitsabha houses a small sphatika(crystal) linga (Chandramoulisvara), {{believed}} to be <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> fell from the crescent adorning Lord Shiva's head and installed by Adi Shankara. The linga {{is associated with the}} intangible fifth element, akasha (ether or space), the eternal infinite expanse where the dance of Lord Shiva takes place daily puja is offered to the linga and also to a small gem-carved figure of Ratnasabhapati.|$|E
50|$|Slider Pin - A Slider pin has <b>a</b> movable <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> slides {{back and}} forth across the base of a pin.|$|R
50|$|A {{player can}} capture <b>an</b> opponent's <b>piece</b> by landing their piece upon it. The {{captured}} piece {{is removed from}} the board and must start again. <b>A</b> <b>piece</b> cannot land on <b>an</b> opponent's <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> is on <b>a</b> resting square.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> player's <b>piece</b> in the Neutral Zone cannot leap {{over and}} capture <b>an</b> enemy <b>piece</b> <b>that's</b> {{also in the}} Neutral Zone, nor can it capture the enemy piece by substitution.|$|R
25|$|Also in 2005, Perspolis Orchestra (Melal Orchestra) played <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> {{dates back}} 3000 years. The notes {{of this piece}} of music, which are {{believed}} to have belonged to Sumerians and ancient Greeks, were discovered among some ancient inscriptions and after being deciphered by archaeologists, was orchestrated by Siavosh Beizaee for Perspolis Orchestra Symphony. However, as it is demonstrated on ancient reliefs of that era, the instrumentations of such pieces probably comprised wind instruments like horn and pipe. Renowned Iranian musician, Peyman Soltani, conducted the Perspolis orchestra.|$|E
25|$|The enamel over steel {{technique}} creates <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> has {{the heat}} distribution of carbon steel and a non-reactive, low-stick surface. Such pots are much lighter {{than most other}} pots of similar size, are cheaper to make than stainless steel pots, {{and do not have}} the rust and reactivity issues of cast iron or carbon steel. Enamel over steel is ideal for large stockpots and for other large pans used mostly for water-based cooking. Because of its light weight and easy cleanup, enamel over steel is also popular for cookware used while camping.|$|E
25|$|Many pieces {{can move}} {{any number of}} empty squares along a {{straight}} line, limited only by {{the edge of the}} board. If an opposing piece intervenes, it may be captured by moving to that square and removing it from the board. A ranging piece must stop where it captures, and cannot bypass <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> is in its way. If a friendly piece intervenes, the moving piece is limited to a distance that stops short of the intervening piece; if the friendly piece is adjacent, it cannot move in that direction at all.|$|E

25|$|Most {{promoting}} pieces {{promote to}} <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> {{exists in the}} initial setup of the board. However, such a promoted piece cannot then promote a second time as its namesake does. For example, a lion promotes to a furious fiend. However, while an eastern barbarian promotes to a lion on its first capturing move, it does not further promote to a furious fiend on its second. Rather, it remains a lion {{for the rest of}} the game. This should be obvious from the game pieces, which only have two sides.|$|E
25|$|For {{several months}} in 1930, Slătineanu taught a course on general {{pathology}} at Iași, and, from 1930 to 1931, headed a medical clinic. For his peacetime activities, he was made a grand officer of the Order of the Star of Romania and the Order of the Crown. He continued writing for Viața Românească down to 1937, when he also contributed, in Revista Fundațiilor Regale, <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> sought to revive interest in Arthur de Gobineau and the Aryan race theory. His other articles saw print in Grigore T. Popa's Însemnări Ieșene review.|$|E
25|$|Many pieces {{can move}} {{any number of}} empty squares along a {{straight}} orthogonal or diagonal line, limited only by {{the edge of the}} board. If an opposing piece intervenes, it may be captured by moving to that square and removing it from the board. A ranging piece must stop where it captures, and cannot bypass <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> is in its way. If a friendly piece intervenes, the moving piece is limited to a distance that stops short of the intervening piece; if the friendly piece is adjacent, it cannot move in that direction at all.|$|E
