40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses liquidity and <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> shocks in over-the-counter (OTC) markets. The {{topic was}} inspired by the pioneering work of Duffie, Gârleanu, and Pedersen (2005, 2007), who initiated a new strand of literature about asset pricing in OTC markets. This thesis completes the <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> shock model of Duffie, Gârleanu, and Pedersen (2007), since {{it turned out to be}} imperfect. The thesis starts with an introduction into the basic search and bargaining model by Duffie et al. (2005) for asset pricing in an illiquid OTC market. Illiquidity is modeled with search frictions, which imply that trade does not happen instantly. Upon finding a trading partner, asset prices are directly bargained between those agents. This model forms the basis for the <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> shock model by Duffie et al. (2007). <b>Aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> shocks are associated with a sudden shift in agents’ preferences towards asset holding, affecting a large fraction of investors simultaneously. Several investors experience a sudden decrease in their liquidity, leading to a forced withdrawal of assets: The market is hit by a selling pressure. This thesis presents an analytical solution method for the <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> shock model of Duffie et al. (2007) and derives a semi-analytical solution for asset prices. Additionally, it shows how to complete the <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> shock model of Duffie et al. (2007), since it turned out to be imperfect...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the liquidity effect in the euro area – the link between the availability of <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> and the interbank overnight rate. Applying a set of assumptions which also lead to the “martingale property ” of the overnight rate, a model linking the latter to the expected <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> conditions is formulated and calibrated. Different assumptions for how the market is establishing its expectation and uncertainty about the <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> conditions are tested for. It is found that the dynamics of the overnight rate is consistent with market participants having, in aggregate, a rather precise expectation about the <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> conditions, however, with an apparent uncertainty which by far exceeds the rather limited variance of the error of this expectation. While the model presented here provides a rather good fit of the overnight rate this indicates that further aspects than just the dynamics of the <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> conditions need to be included in order to conceptually describe the overnight rate. An EUR 1 billion expected liquidity imbalance {{on the last day of}} the maintenance period is estimated to, ceteris paribus, affect the overnight rate by 7 basis points on that day...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{documents}} a {{close link}} between mispricing and liquidity by investigating stocks with high analyst disagreement. Previous research finds that these stocks {{tend to be}} overpriced, but that prices correct downwards as uncertainty about earnings is resolved. Our analysis suggests that one reason mispricing has persisted through the years is that analyst disagreement coincides with high trading costs. We also show that in the cross-section, the less liquid stocks {{tend to be more}} severely overpriced. Additionally, increases in <b>aggregate</b> market <b>liquidity</b> accelerate the convergence of prices to fundamentals.

40|$|Pari-mutuel {{markets are}} trading {{platforms}} {{through which the}} common market maker simultaneously clears multiple contingent claims markets. This market has several distinctive properties that began attracting {{the attention of the}} financial industry in the 2000 s. For example, the platform <b>aggregates</b> <b>liquidity</b> from the individual contingent claims market into the common pool while shielding the market maker from potential financial loss. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we provide a new economic interpretation of the market-clearing strategy of a pari-mutuel market that is well known in the literature. The pari-mutuel auctioneer is shown to be equivalent to the market maker with extreme ambiguity aversion for the future contingent event. Second, based on this theoretical understanding, we present a new market-clearing algorithm called the Knightian Pari-mutuel Mechanism (KPM). The KPM retains many interesting properties of pari-mutuel markets while explicitly controlling for the market maker's ambiguity aversion. In addition, the KPM is computationally efficient in that it is solvable in polynomial time...|$|R

Rather than transacting in equities or bonds, mutual funds use cash to accommodate inflows and outflows.

Mutual funds are large holders of cash in the <b>aggregate,</b> and thus <b>liquidity</b> provision by mutual funds is highly dependent on liquidity provision by the traditional banking and shadow banking sectors.

40|$|A {{sizeable}} {{stream of}} {{theoretical and empirical}} research in corporate finance reveals that corporate investment and financing activities in capital markets occur in waves through time, which are accompanied with many abnormal phenomena surrounding and after the announcement of events. Motivated by existing studies in firm-level and aggregate-level liquidity, which suggest the influence of (<b>aggregate)</b> <b>liquidity</b> on the activity and quality of corporate events, {{the purpose of this}} thesis is to investigate and understand the role of <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> in explaining existing phenomena associated with corporate investment and financing events including mergers and acquisitions (M&A), initial public offerings (IPOs), seasoned equity offerings (SEOs), and, finally, corporate asset sales. Liquidity is an important and special asset for firms operating in imperfect capital markets. At aggregate level, corporate holdings of liquidity and the market provision of liquidity play important roles in capital markets, which inevitably affect the decision making and performance of corporate events. In this research, I investigate whether corporate investment and financing events occurring during high <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> markets are fundamentally different from those occurring during low <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> markets. Empirical evidences in this research show that the activity and quality of major corporate investment and financing events are substantially influenced by <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity.</b> Moreover, many of the market anomalies concentrate in certain <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> conditions. For M&A, I find that there are more acquisitions in highliquidity periods, and acquirers buying during high-liquidity markets have significantly higher pre-announcement returns, but lower post-merger abnormal returns. For IPOs and SEOs, results show that there are many more public equity offerings in high-liquidity periods than in low-liquidity periods. Offering firms selling securities during high-liquidity markets have significantly higher occurrences of underpricing (discounting) and suffer larger long-run underperformance. For asset sales, highliquidity divesting firms have better performance measured by firm characteristics and post-sale returns...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, market {{liquidity}} {{has been a}} major issue for stock market participants and even becomes {{one of the most important}} challenges since the recent financial crisis. In this context, this dissertation is centered on this topic and presents three empirical essays incorporating liquidity considerations in three different subfields of Finance, namely, asset pricing, portfolio allocation and mutual fund timing. The first essay (Chapter 2) is related to asset pricing and demonstrates that liquidity and quality are priced characteristics in the stock market, but their pricing is conditional on market volatility conditions. The second essay (Chapter 3) is devoted to portfolio allocation and shows that <b>aggregate</b> market <b>liquidity</b> shocks has a significant influence on optimal portfolio allocations. In addition, it emphasizes that liquidity-responsive strategies could be a valuable tool for investors and portfolio managers to actively manage risks and capture return opportunities. The third essay (Chapter 4) focuses rather on mutual fund timing and examines what style liquidity timing skills may mutual fund managers possess. This study highlights that, in anticipation of <b>aggregate</b> market <b>liquidity</b> changes, mutual funds do not switch their investments between stocks and cash but they rather switch between only small and large stocks. Overall, the main message to take away from this research is that investors and portfolio managers should take into consideration both the liquidity of their individual stocks and the liquidity of the market as a whole...|$|R

40|$|We build {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} model to analyze how the ability of banks to create money can affect asset prices and financial stability. In the model, demand for liquidity {{takes the form of}} demand for money to make payments. We show that banks can provide elastic <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> by creating and lending out deposits, which will reduce the need for people to sell assets and help maintain asset price stability. We also compare two types of liquidity provision mechanisms. The first is liquidity-risk-sharing through a Diamond-and-Dybvig style coalition that pools together people¡¯s resources, and the second is liquidity provision by banks though money creation. We show that without elastic <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> provided by banks, coalitions can not actually perform their risk-sharing function, their attempt to sell assets to raise liquidity will only make asset prices decrease further, without actually raising more liquidity for shareholders hit by liquidity shocks. However, with banks providing elastic <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity,</b> people can indeed achieve better risk-sharing though coalitions. Finally, we show that the central bank can help banks provide liquidity to the market by lending to banks at low interest rates during the inter-bank settlement process, so as to relax the liquidity constraint of banks.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of monetary policy {{depends largely on}} how it affects bank behavior. Recent events have cast doubt on how well monetary policy works in this respect, particularly during financial crises. In addition, issues have been raised {{about the role of}} banks in creating asset bubbles that burst and lead to crises. In this paper, we address these issues by focusing on bank liquidity creation, which is a comprehensive measure of bank output that accounts for all on- and off-balance sheet activities. Specifically we formulate and test hypotheses that address the following questions: (1) How does monetary policy affect total bank liquidity creation and its two main components, on- and off-balance sheet liquidity creation, during normal times? (2) Does monetary policy affect bank liquidity creation differently during financial crises versus normal times? (3) Is high <b>aggregate</b> bank <b>liquidity</b> creation an indicator of an impending financial crisis? We identify five financial crises and use data on virtually all U. S. banks between 1984 :Q 1 and 2008 :Q 4. Our main findings are as follows. First, during normal times, monetary policy tightening is associated with a reduction in liquidity creation by small banks, with much of the impact driven by a reduction in on-balance sheet liquidity creation. Monetary policy does not significantly affect liquidity creation by large and medium banks, which create roughly 90 % of <b>aggregate</b> bank <b>liquidity.</b> Second, during financial crises, the effect of monetary policy on liquidity creation is weaker than during normal times fo...|$|R

To test these hypotheses, we apply a dynamic panel model and examine the variation of FPI relative to FDI for 140 source countries from 1985 to 2004. Our key variable is the probability of an <b>aggregate</b> <b>liquidity</b> crisis, estimated from a Probit model, as proxied by episodes of economy-wide sales of external assets.
