5|$|From <b>a</b> <b>behavioral</b> standpoint, one of {{the most}} {{valuable}} dinosaur fossils was discovered in the Gobi Desert in 1971. It included a Velociraptor attacking a Protoceratops, providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an Edmontosaurus, a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged {{in such a way that}} shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived. Cannibalism amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod Majungasaurus.|$|E
5|$|Gregarious German {{cockroaches}} show different behavior when {{reared in}} isolation from when reared in a group. In one study, isolated cockroaches {{were less likely to}} leave their shelters and explore, spent less time eating, interacted less with conspecifics when exposed to them, and took longer to recognize receptive females. Because these changes occurred in many contexts, the authors suggested them as constituting <b>a</b> <b>behavioral</b> syndrome. These effects might have been due either to reduced metabolic and developmental rates in isolated individuals or the fact that the isolated individuals hadn't had a training period to learn about what others were like via their antennae.|$|E
50|$|Behavioral therapies help {{patients}} change their initial {{attitudes and behaviors}} {{that are related to}} drug use. For example, patients {{should be aware of the}} severe consequences of drugs after the therapies. In addition, <b>a</b> successful <b>behavioral</b> therapy should also {{help patients}} build up a set of healthy habits and lifestyle, as guiding and educating them is also an essential component of behavioral therapy. What's more, for <b>an</b> effective <b>behavioral</b> treatment, it is important to pair it with proper medication. <b>As</b> <b>behavioral</b> treatment mainly cures the patients mentally, while medication cures the patients physically. They are dependent on each other and should be used towards the patients simultaneously.|$|R

5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey {{by living}} {{out of sight of}} predators, whether in caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is <b>a</b> <b>behavioral</b> form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.|$|E

5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as {{to have a better}} chance of mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by <b>a</b> <b>behavioral</b> ecologist, John Alcock, showed that a large majority of the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Some {{physiological}} carnivores consume plant {{matter and}} some physiological herbivores consuming meat. From <b>a</b> <b>behavioral</b> aspect, {{this would make}} them omnivores, but from the physiological standpoint, {{this may be due}} to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification. For example, it is well documented that some ungulates. such as giraffes, camels, and cattle, will gnaw on bones to consume particular minerals and nutrients. Also, cats, which are generally regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material (such as hairballs), aid with hemoglobin production, and as a laxative.|$|E

25|$|Although {{it is easy}} {{to assume}} that each of these traits was uniquely {{selected}} for by hunter-gatherers and early farmers, beginning in 1959 Dmitry Belyayev tested the reactions of silver foxes to a hand placed in their cage and selected the tamest, least aggressive individuals to breed. His hypothesis was that, by selecting <b>a</b> <b>behavioral</b> trait, he could also influence the phenotype of subsequent generations, making them more domestic in appearance. Over the next 40 years, he succeeded in producing foxes with traits that were never directly selected for, including piebald coats floppy ears, upturned tails, shortened snouts, and shifts in developmental timing. In the 1980s, a researcher used a set of behavioral, cognitive, and visible phenotypic markers, such as coat colour, to produce domesticated fallow deer within a few generations. Similar results for tameness and fear have been found for mink and Japanese quail. In addition to demonstrating that domestic phenotypic traits could arise through selection for <b>a</b> <b>behavioral</b> trait, and domestic behavioral traits could arise through the selection for a phenotypic trait, these experiments provided a mechanism to explain how the animal domestication process could have begun without deliberate human forethought and action.|$|E
