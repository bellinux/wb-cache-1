[...] San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "a rich trove of sharply written essays from the campaign". The New York Times criticized the work for its lack of moderation. The Daily Beast characterized it as [...] "raucous, trenchant, knee-slapping". Adelaide Review said it was, [...] "one of the finest exponents of polemic journalism".

500|$|British novelist Justin Cartwright, {{who wrote}} the book The Song Before It Is Sung <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot's conspirators, wrote, [...] "The film is true {{to most of the}} facts of the plot, but fails to convey any sense of the catastrophic moral and {{political}} vortex into which Germans were being drawn." [...] Though not depicted, but briefly mentioned in the film, von Stauffenberg was persuaded to become involved in the plot by his uncle, Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband, who was disenchanted with the Nazis. The film also did not explore von Stauffenberg's philosophy and background, which Cartwright felt fit the German tradition of Dichter und Helden ("poets and heroes"). Cartwright described how von Stauffenberg was an appropriate leader for the plot: [...] "He was the man who unmistakably wore the mantle of a near-mystic German past, a warrior Germany, a noble Germany, a poetic Germany, a Germany of myth and longing." [...] The novelist felt that Cruise's portrayal was more akin to one as a [...] "troublesome cop". Cartwright also noted that the film did not raise the question of what kind of Germany von Stauffenberg had in mind if the plot succeeded.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{its release}} in the United Kingdom on 5 March 2007, [...] "She's Madonna" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics.

[...] "Who'd have guessed he'd sound so comfortable—his most convincing in years, actually—singing <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few people in the world who's more famous than him ?", Levine concluded. Alexis Petridis from The Guardian described the track as a [...] "brilliant, icy meditation on fame's corrupting power". NMEs Priya Elan listed [...] "She's Madonna" [...] as one of Williams' most [...] "bonkers song ever", along with three other songs from Rudebox: [...] "The 80's", [...] "The 90's" [...] and [...] "The Actor". Hubbard explained that the Pet Shop Boys brought an [...] "added spray of sheen to the glacially excellent" [...] song, and working with them brought some [...] "credibility" [...] to it. Julie Broadfoot from BBC Music described [...] "She's Madonna" [...] as a [...] "weird but fun tune". Lauren Murphy from Entertainment website noted that Pet Shop Boys' own musical influence was prevalent in the track, with its [...] "sparse, spacey glow and not least on synth-laden tongue-in-cheek homage" [...] of the song.|$|E

500|$|Wilson and McDaniel {{continued}} to collaborate at Cornell until Wilson left to head Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois in 1967. In 1972, Wilson invited McDaniel {{to serve as}} acting head of the accelerator section at Fermilab, and McDanield took a one-year {{leave of absence from}} Cornell. Though the Fermilab accelerator had been placed into operation, it suffered from frequent component failures. When McDaniel left eight months later, he led the effort which increased the power of Fermilab's accelerator from 20 GeV to 300 GeV and its beam density by a factor of 1000. Of McDaniel's contribution to Fermilab, Wilson said, [...] "This bravura performance demonstrated Mac’s skill for leadership as well as his celebrated sixth sense for finding sources of trouble and fixing them.” Upon returning to Cornell in 1974, McDaniel proposed upgrading the then existing 10 GeV synchrotron with an 8 GeV electron-positron storage ring, which would greatly increase the energy of particle collisions when the particles in the storage ring hit the particles traveling in the opposite direction in the synchrotron. [...] When constructed in 1979, the Cornell Electron Storage Ring became the world's primary source of information <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fundamental building blocks of matter, the b-quark. [...] After the end of particle physics experiments 20 years later, CESR is now used as a test facility of damping rings for a future international linear collider. In 1981, McDaniel developed a proposal for a new mile-diameter electron-positron collider called CSER II, but could not obtain the necessary $200 million in funding for it. In 1988, McDaniel was Visiting Distinguished Professor at Arizona State University.|$|E
