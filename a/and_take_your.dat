25|$|I {{might put}} it this way. The story is cast {{in terms of a}} good side, and a bad side, beauty against {{ruthless}} ugliness, tyranny against kingship, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save mere power, and so on; but both sides in some degree, conservative or destructive, want a measure of control. But if you have, as it were, taken 'a vow of poverty', renounced control, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> delight in things for themselves without reference to yourself, watching, observing, and to some extent knowing, then the questions of the rights and wrongs of power and control might become utterly meaningless to you, and the means of power quite valueless...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{demonstrate}} the durability of Radioactive Man #1000, Comic Book Guy pours soda on it, which bounces off and instead damages a batch of [...] "lesser" [...] comics. On top of the batch {{is an issue of}} Bongo Comics, a comic book written by Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons. The comedian Gallagher is shown doing his routine with a watermelon during a flashback. [...] While in The Android's Dungeon, Nelson examines a comic book called The Death of Sad Sack, a reference to both the American comic strip The Sad Sack and the [...] "Death of Superman" [...] story arc. When Homer and Comic Book Guy enter Moe's Tavern, Moe says [...] "Get out <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> Sacagawea dollars with you" [...] to one of his customers. A Sacagawea dollar is a United States dollar coin which has been minted since 2000. After he is thrown out of Moe's Tavern, Comic Book Guy says the word [...] "loneliness" [...] in Klingon, a language used by the fictional Klingons in the Star Trek universe. While arguing with Agnes, Comic Book Guy says [...] "Now I know what ever happened to Baby Jane." [...] The line is a reference to the 1960 suspense novel What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?. Martin's mother tries to sell Comic Book Guy several items relating to the Star Wars film series including Carrie Fisher's [...] "anti-jiggle breast tape", George Lucas' handwritten original script of [...] and a film of a supposed alternate ending for the series where it is revealed that [...] "Luke's father is Chewbacca." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{day that}} a new poll showed McCain five points ahead in the state, Bush allied himself on stage with a {{marginal}} and controversial veterans activist named J. Thomas Burch, who accused McCain of having [...] "abandoned the veterans" [...] on POW/MIA and Agent Orange issues: [...] "He came home from Vietnam and forgot us." [...] Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton, which Bush complained was [...] "about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary and many Republicans thought comparing Bush's truthfulness to Bill Clinton's dishonesty was distasteful smear by McCain." [...] An unidentified party began a semi-underground smear campaign against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, audience plants, and the like. [...] These claimed most famously that he had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter Bridget was adopted from Bangladesh; this misrepresentation {{was thought to be}} an especially effective slur in a Deep South state where race was still central), but also that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days. [...] The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with these attacks; Bush said he would fire anyone who ran defamatory push polls. During a break in a debate, Bush put his hand on McCain's arm and reiterated that he had no involvement in the attacks; McCain replied, [...] "Don't give me that shit. <b>And</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> hands off me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{their early}} dislike for one another, Goldman and de Cleyre came to {{respect each other}} intellectually. In her 1894 essay [...] "In Defense of Emma Goldman and the Right of Expropriation", de Cleyre wrote {{in support of the}} right of {{expropriation}} while remaining neutral on its advocacy: [...] "I do not think one little bit of sensitive human flesh is worth all the property rights in N. Y. city … I say it is your business to decide whether you will starve and freeze in sight of food and clothing, outside of jail, or commit some overt act against the institution of property <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> place beside Timmermann and Goldmann." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout history {{many have}} {{understood}} Jesus of Nazareth {{to have been}} a pacifist, drawing on his Sermon on the Mount. In the sermon Jesus stated that one should [...] "not resist an evildoer" [...] and promoted his turn the other cheek philosophy. [...] "If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; and if anyone wants to sue you <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> coat, give your cloak as well... Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you." [...] The New Testament story is of Jesus, besides preaching these words, surrendering himself freely to an enemy intent on having him killed and proscribing his followers from defending him.|$|E
