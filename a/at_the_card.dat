5|$|When conjuring tricks with {{playing cards}} became popular around the 19th century, magicians would often include card flourishes in their {{performances}} {{to demonstrate their}} sleight of hand abilities. Unlike tricks, flourishes were intended to be visually impressive and appear difficult to perform. Some of the first flourishes to be documented include the Charlier Cut, Riffle Shuffle and Thumb Fan. Several sleight of hand bestsellers, such as S. W. Erdnase's The Expert <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Card</b> Table from 1902 (which shared roots in gambling and cheating at cards), {{emphasized the importance of}} incorporating flourishes into tricks. Up until the 2000s, card flourishing were considered a mere subsection of close-up magic and not an independent performance art.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{continued}} {{to expand his}} practice while being appointed director of many companies, mainly in Kingston. Macdonald became both a director of and {{a lawyer for the}} new Commercial Bank of the Midland District. Throughout the 1840s, Macdonald invested heavily in real estate, including commercial properties in downtown Toronto. Meanwhile, he was suffering from some illness, and in 1841, his father died. Sick and grieving, he decided to take a lengthy holiday in Britain in early 1842. He left for the journey well supplied with money, as he spent the last three days before his departure gambling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> game loo and winning substantially. Sometime during his two months in Britain, he met his first cousin, Isabella Clark. As Macdonald did not mention her in his letters home, the circumstances of their meeting are not known. In late 1842, Isabella journeyed to Kingston to visit with a sister. The visit stretched for nearly a year before John and Isabella Macdonald married on 1 September 1843.|$|E

Omar demands that Proposition Joe help him rob Marlo, and Joe agrees to alert Omar when Joe's soldier Cheese is {{dropping}} off Marlo's package. Omar orchestrates an elaborate and successful hijacking of Joe's entire shipment of heroin as it enters port. As he had no wish to sell drugs on the street, he sells the heroin back to Proposition Joe. Although the heist makes Omar a lot of money, it has all of the drug kingpins ready to put a contract on his head.|$|E
500|$|Gates {{was raised}} on the family's farm, but did not care for farm life. [...] At an early age, he entered into his first {{business}} proposition: to husk a neighbor's corn. His next business venture was to clear some land of timber for another neighbor. [...] Gates earned US$1,000 for this job, selling the timber as firewood to homes and to the railroad. Gates then took the money from this labor and bought a half interest in a threshing machine. As this type of equipment was very new at the time, few farms owned one, so Gates and his partner hired themselves out to work with it at various local farms. After one season, Gates tired {{of this type of}} work and he sold his interest in the threshing machine to his partner and another friend. Gates then set himself up as a local grain broker, doing business from the family's home. [...] This business venture was a failure; in an effort to escape farm work, he took to spending time at the railroad depot where he had previously sold firewood. The railroad men remembered him and now asked him to join their poker games. [...] Gates found he had an aptitude for the game and for anticipating the cards men held and how they would play them. [...] With the grain brokerage now forgotten, he was able to make up the losses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>card</b> table.|$|E
2500|$|Con men and grifters too may use {{techniques}} of conjuring for fraudulent goals. Cheating at card games {{is an obvious}} example, and not a surprising one: {{one of the most}} respected textbooks of card techniques for magicians, The Expert <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Card</b> Table by Erdnase, was primarily written as an instruction manual for card sharps. The card trick known as [...] "Find the Lady" [...] or [...] "Three-card Monte" [...] is an old favourite of street hustlers, who lure the victim into betting on what seems like a simple proposition: to identify, after a seemingly easy-to-track mixing sequence, which one of three face-down cards is the Queen. Another example is the shell game, in which a pea is hidden under one of three walnut shells, then shuffled around the table (or sidewalk) so slowly as to make the pea's position seemingly obvious. Although these are well known as frauds, people still lose money on them; a shell-game ring was broken up in Los Angeles as recently as December 2009.|$|E
