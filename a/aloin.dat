40|$|The {{separation}} of some anthrone-C-glucosyl constituents of aloe {{was carried out}} by isocratic capillary electrochromatography using a 50 I~m I. D. column packed with 3 I~m ODS silica gel. In comparison to HPLC mode, CEC resolution of <b>aloins</b> was obtained {{in a very short time}} with a high selectivi b, factor. The influence of mobile phase parameters (pH and ionic strength of the buffer, acetonitrile amount in the eluent etc.) on the retention of <b>aloins</b> was examined in order to improve the separation conditions and to study the retention mechanism. Efficiency was found to increase with decreasing the EOF up to a reduced plate height of about 2 at a reduced linear velocif/of 0. 3 mm s 1. This effect was ascribed to the fact that, under the buffer conditions used (pH 8), <b>aloins</b> are partially anionically charged, with a consequent low mass transfer bel',,veen the mobile and stationary phases. However, resolution remains almost the same in a wide pH range permitting baseline separations of <b>aloins</b> in short analysis times. Since <b>aloins</b> are known to undergo fast degradation reaction dependent on pH, a kinetic study was also carried out. The method was extended to the analysis of <b>aloins</b> in food and cosmetic products...|$|R
50|$|The hydroxyanthracene glycosides are {{not readily}} {{absorbed in the}} small {{intestine}} but are hydrolyzed by intestinal flora to a form that is partly absorbed in the colon. Hydrolysis of the cascarosides results {{in the formation of}} <b>aloins</b> such as barbaloin and chrysaloin.

50|$|According to W. A. Shenstone, {{two classes}} of <b>aloins</b> are recognized: (1) nataloins, which yield picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid, and do not give a red {{coloration}} with nitric acid; and (2) barbaloins, which yield aloetic acid (C7H2N3O5), chrysammic acid (C7H2N2O6), picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid, being reddened by the acid. This second group may be divided into a-barbaloins, obtained from Barbados Aloe, and reddened in the cold, and b-barbaloins, obtained from Aloe Socotrina and Zanzibar Aloe, reddened by ordinary nitric acid only when warmed or by fuming acid in the cold. Nataloin (2C17H13O7·H2O) forms bright-yellow scales, barbaloin (C17H18O7) prismatic crystals. Aloe species also contain a trace of volatile oil, to which their odour is due.|$|R
50|$|<b>Aloin</b> {{extracted}} from natural sources {{is a mixture}} of two diastereomers, termed <b>aloin</b> A (also called barbaloin) and <b>aloin</b> B (or isobarbaloin), which have similar chemical properties. <b>Aloin</b> is an anthraquinone glycosyl, meaning that its anthraquinone skeleton has been modified by the addition of a sugar molecule. Anthraquinones are a common family of naturally occurring yellow, orange, and red pigments of which many have cathartic properties, attributes shared by <b>aloin.</b> <b>Aloin</b> is related to aloe emodin, which lacks a sugar group but shares aloin's biological properties.|$|E
50|$|Once ingested, <b>aloin</b> {{increases}} peristaltic contractions in the colon, which induces bowel movements. <b>Aloin</b> also {{prevents the}} colon from re-absorbing {{water from the}} gastrointestinal tract, which leads to softer stools. This effect is caused by aloin's opening of chloride channels of the colonic membrane. In higher doses, these effects may lead to electrolyte imbalance, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, which are common side-effects of the drug. Because <b>aloin</b> can potentially cause uterine contractions, pregnant women should avoid ingesting aloe products containing <b>aloin</b> in more than trace amounts.|$|E

40|$|Diabetes is a {{metabolic}} disorder associated with either improper {{functioning of the}} beta-cells or wherein cells fail to use insulin properly. Insulin, the principal hormone regulates uptake of glucose from the blood into most of the cells except central nervous system. Therefore, deficiency of insulin or the insensitivity of its receptors {{plays a key role}} in all forms of diabetes. In the present work, attempt has been made to find out plant sources which show anti hyperglycaemic activity (AhG) (i. e. compounds that bring down the blood glucose level in the body). Ayurvedic plants showing AhG activity formed the basis of our study by using the platform of Computer Aided Drug Designing (CADD). Among 600 plants showing AhG activity, 500 compounds were selected and screened, out of which 243 compounds showed drug likeness property that can be used as therapeutic ligand/drug. Initial screening of such compounds was done based on their drug likeness or biochemical properties. Dynamic interaction of these molecules was captured through Protein-Ligand study. It also gave an insight of the binding pockets involved. Bench marking of all the parameters were done using the diabetic inhibitor drug, Glipizide.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. This {{project is}} focused on the {{synthesis}} and biological activity of <b>aloin</b> and derivatives. <b>Aloin</b> is a C-glucoside anthrone that is found in Aloe marlothii, a common Southern African plant used in traditional medicine. <b>Aloin</b> was isolated from A. marlothii, employing a selective chelation isolation procedure. This compound is known to have numerous biologically active properties, and {{can be used as a}} laxative, an anti-bacterial agent, an anti-oxidant, and as a cytotoxic drug against breast and ovarian tumour cell lines. More relevant to this research investigation, was the reported anti-inflammatory activity of <b>aloin.</b> Specifically, the inhibitory activity of <b>aloin</b> on matrix metalloproteinases, which when excessively secreted, can lead to the development of osteoarthritis and cancer metastasis. <b>Aloin</b> has also been reported to have antiplasmodial activity, which was also investigated. <b>Aloin</b> was synthetically transformed into several derivatives, which could be potentially useful medicinal compounds. The choice of derivatives to be made was based upon (i) known biologically active compounds (e. g. aloe-emodin) and (ii) interesting biologically active functional groups (e. g. amines). These <b>aloin</b> derivatives include aloe-emodin, rheinal, rhein and three amine derivatives. Homonataloin, an aloin-analogue, which was also isolated from A. marlothii, was synthetically transformed into nataloe-emodin. These two compounds serve as <b>aloin</b> structural analogues for the biological testing. <b>Aloin</b> and derivatives were characterised using NMR, HR-MS, UV and IR, which allowed for their unambiguous structural elucidation. <b>Aloin</b> and derivatives were all tested for (i) possible inhibition towards MMP- 2 and MMP- 9, which are the two most common MMPs in the blood, and (ii) antiplasmodial activity against chloroquine sensitive Plasmodium falciparum parasites. Doxycycline, a clinical tetracycline drug, was used as a reference compound for the biological assays, since it shares many common structural features with <b>aloin</b> and derivatives. 11 -(Piperidin- 1 -yl) chrysophanol and 11 -(morpholin- 1 -yl) chrysophanol proved to be the most potent selective MMP- 2 inhibitors. 11 -(Piperidin- 1 -yl) chrysophanol was also found to be the most potent against P. falciparum parasite, along with 11 -(pyrrolidin- 1 -yl) chrysophanol. <b>Aloin</b> has been shown to be a cheap, easily obtainable lead compound that could facilitate the production of a range of powerful medicinal drugs...|$|E
