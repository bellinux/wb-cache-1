5|$|A classic {{site for}} the study of biocolonisation from founder populations that arrive from outside (allochthonous), Surtsey was {{declared}} a nature reserve in 1965, while the eruption was still in active progress. Today only a few scientists are permitted to land on Surtsey; the only way anyone else can see it closely is from <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>plane.</b> This allows the natural ecological succession for the island to proceed without outside interference. In 2008, UNESCO declared the island a World Heritage Site, in recognition of its great scientific value.|$|E

25|$|Some are {{concerned}} that individual intelligence agencies will create their own wikis, draining ideas and input from Intellipedia. Sean Dennehy, a CIA official involved in integrating the system into the intelligence fabric, said disseminating material to the widest possible audience of analysts is key to avoiding mistakes. He said analysts from multiple agencies had used the network to post frequent updates on recent events, including the crash of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>plane</b> into a New York City apartment building in October 2006 and North Korea's test of a missile in July 2006.|$|E

25|$|On October 11, 2006, Lidle and {{his flight}} {{instructor}} crashed <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>plane</b> into a 50-story condominium tower on Manhattan's Upper East Side.

They also refused to take any phone calls for the first couple of days after the crash, which led many to speculate that they were afraid of what their callers would say. In fact, many of the other hosts during their shows received quite a number of phone calls lambasting Francesa and Russo.|$|E
25|$|Yoshikawa began {{gathering}} {{intelligence in}} earnest by taking auto trips around the main islands, and toured Oahu in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>plane,</b> {{posing as a}} tourist.

Once, he gained access to Hickam Field in a taxi, memorizing the number of visible planes, pilots, hangars, barracks and soldiers. He was also able to discover that Sunday was the day of the week on which the largest number of ships were likely to be in harbor, that PBY patrol planes went out every morning and evening, and that there was an antisubmarine net in the mouth of the harbor. Information was returned to Japan in coded form in Consular communications, and by direct delivery to intelligence officers aboard Japanese ships calling at Hawaii by consulate staff.|$|E
