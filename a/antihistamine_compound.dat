40|$|AbstractThe {{identification}} of amyloid-binding compounds {{is a crucial}} step {{in the development of}} imaging probes and therapeutics for the detection and cure of Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, the process typically lags during the translation from in vitro to in vivo studies due to the impenetrable nature of the blood brain barrier (BBB). Here, we integrate fluorescence assay with MALDI imaging mass spectrometry to screen known compounds and repurpose their properties to enable the second function of binding to amyloid plaques. Through this approach, we identified an <b>antihistamine</b> <b>compound,</b> promethazine, that can bind to amyloid plaques. Finally, we demonstrate that promethazine is retained in the amyloid-burdened brain compared to a normal brain and that its distribution within the brain corroborates with that of amyloid plaques...|$|E
40|$|Ketotifen, an orally-administered {{anti-anaphylactic}} and <b>antihistamine</b> <b>compound,</b> {{was given}} in a dose of 0 · 06 mg/kg to 142 infants and young children presenting either with non-infected wheezy bronchitis or bronchial asthma to an allergy out-patient department. Treatment continued for 12 weeks. At {{the end of this}} time, ketotifen was considered to be very effective or effective in 70 % of the children. The effect was more marked in non-infected wheezy bronchitis (83 · 55 % response) than in bronchial asthma (56 · 5 % response), perhaps because factors such as leukotrienes, prostaglandins and thromboxanes tend to produce a sustained bronchoconstriction in the latter condition. Ketotifen was not associated with any adverse effects and did not cause behavioural problems. Patients found it palatable and acceptable. The main disadvantage was that symptoms recurred within days of stopping treatment. Especially in non-infected wheezy bronchitis, ketotifen should be given for a year or longer to older children (older than 30 months) who have shown an initial good response to the drug...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Dimebon is an <b>antihistamine</b> <b>compound</b> with a {{long history}} of {{clinical}} use in Russia. Recently, Dimebon has been proposed to be useful for treating neurodegenerative disorders. It has demonstrated efficacy in phase II Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD) clinical trials. The mechanisms responsible for the beneficial actions of Dimebon in AD and HD remain unclear. It has been suggested that Dimebon may act by blocking NMDA receptors or voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels and by preventing mitochondrial permeability pore transition. Results We evaluated the effects of Dimebon in experiments with primary striatal neuronal cultures (MSN) from wild type (WT) mice and YAC 128 HD transgenic mice. We found that Dimebon acts as an inhibitor of NMDA receptors (IC 50 = 10 μM) and voltage-gated calcium channels (IC 50 = 50 μM) in WT and YAC 128 MSN. We further found that application of 50 μM Dimebon stabilized glutamate-induced Ca 2 + signals in YAC 128 MSN and protected cultured YAC 128 MSN from glutamate-induced apoptosis. Lower concentrations of Dimebon (5 μM and 10 μM) did not stabilize glutamate-induced Ca 2 + signals and did not exert neuroprotective effects in experiments with YAC 128 MSN. Evaluation of Dimebon against a set of biochemical targets indicated that Dimebon inhibits α-Adrenergic receptors (α 1 A, α 1 B, α 1 D, and α 2 A), Histamine H 1 and H 2 receptors and Serotonin 5 -HT 2 c, 5 -HT 5 A, 5 -HT 6 receptors with high affinity. Dimebon also had significant effect on a number of additional receptors. Conclusion Our results suggest that Ca 2 + and mitochondria stabilizing effects may, in part, be responsible for beneficial clinical effects of Dimebon. However, the high concentrations of Dimebon required to achieve Ca 2 + stabilizing and neuroprotective effects in our in vitro studies (50 μM) indicate that properties of Dimebon as cognitive enhancer are most likely due to potent inhibition of H 1 histamine receptors. It is also possible that Dimebon acts on novel high affinity targets not present in cultured MSN preparation. Unbiased evaluation of Dimebon against a set of biochemical targets indicated that Dimebon efficiently inhibited a number of additional receptors. Potential interactions with these receptors need to be considered in interpretation of results obtained with Dimebon in clinical trials. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. Proarrhythmic {{effects have}} been {{observed}} with the selective histamine 1 (H 1) receptor antagonist drug astemizole, a widely prescribed antihistamine. The metabolites of astemizole {{and those of other}} <b>antihistamine</b> <b>compounds</b> have not been implicated as causative agents of cardiac arrhythmias. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine whether desmethylastemizole, the principal metabolite of astemizole, blocks delayed rectifier potassium (K+) channels. Background. QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes are associated with astemizole intake and have been ascribed to block the repolarizing K+ currents, specifically the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier iKr. Astemizole undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, and its dominant metabolite, desmethylastemizole, has a markedly prolonged elimination time. We report the clinical observation of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes in a patient with undetectable serum concentrations of astemizole (< 0. 5 ng/ml) and “therapeutic” concentrations of desmethylastemizole (up to 7. 7 ng/ml or 17. 3 nmol/liter). Methods. The perforated patch clamp recording technique was used to study the effects of desmethylastemizole (20 nmol/liter) on action potentials and iKr in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes. Results. Desmethylastemizole produced action potential prolongation and the induction of plateau early afterdepolarizations. Under voltage clamp conditions, desmethylastemizole suppressed iKr amplitude by ≈ 65 %. The drug E- 4031 (100 nmol/liter), which selectively blocks iKr, had a similar effect on current amplitude. Conclusions. Desmethylastemizole, the major astemizole metabolite, blocks the repolarizing K+ current iKr with high affinity. The clinical observation of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes found with astemizole intake may principally be caused by the proarrhythmic effects of its metabolite desmethylastemizole...|$|R
40|$|Molecular orbital {{calculations}} {{were carried}} out {{on a set of}} 28 non-imidazole H(3) <b>antihistamine</b> <b>compounds</b> using the Hartree-Fock method in order to investigate the possible relationships between electronic structural properties and binding affinity for H 3 receptors (pK(i)). It was observed that the frontier effective-for-reaction molecular orbital (FERMO) energies were better correlated with pK(i) values than highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy values. Exploratory data analysis through hierarchical cluster (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) showed a separation of the compounds in two sets, one grouping the molecules with high pK(i) values, the other gathering low pK(i) value compounds. This separation was obtained {{with the use of the}} following descriptors: FERMO energies (epsilon(FERMO)), charges derived from the electrostatic potential on the nitrogen atom (N(1)), electronic density indexes for FERMO on the N(1) atom (Sigma((FERMO)) c(i) (2)). and electrophilicity (omega`). These electronic descriptors were used to construct a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model through the partial least-squares (PLS) method with three principal components. This model generated Q(2) = 0. 88 and R(2) = 0. 927 values obtained from a training set and external validation of 23 and 5 molecules, respectively. After the analysis of the PLS regression equation and the values for the selected electronic descriptors, it is suggested that high values of FERMO energies and of Sigma((FERMO)) c(i) (2), together with low values of electrophilicity and pronounced negative charges on N(1) appear as desirable properties for the conception of new molecules which might have high binding affinity. 2010 Elsevier Inc.
