50|$|In the {{original}} system, {{as applied to}} 625 line analogue TV, the audio signal was sampled twice during each television line and each sample converted to 10-bit PCM. Two such samples were inserted into the next line synchronising pulse. At the destination, the audio samples were converted back to <b>analogue</b> <b>form</b> and the video waveform restored to normal. Compandors operating on the signal before encoding and after decoding enabled the required signal-to-noise ratio to be achieved. As the PCM noise was predominantly high-pitched, the compandor only needed to operate on the high frequencies. Also, the compandor only operated at high audio levels, so that modulation of the noise by the companding would be masked by the relatively loud high-frequency audio components. A pilot tone at half the sampling frequency was transmitted to enable the expander to track the gain adjustment applied by the compressor, even when the latter was limiting.|$|E

50|$|Radio {{wavelengths}} {{are much}} longer than optical wavelengths, and the observing stations in radio astronomical interferometers are correspondingly further apart. The very large distances do not always allow any usable transmission of radio waves received at the telescopes to some central interferometry point. For this reason many telescopes instead record the radio waves onto a storage medium. The recordings are then transferred to a central correlator station where the waves are interfered. Historically the recordings were analog and were made on magnetic tapes. This was quickly superseded by the current method of digitizing the radio waves, and then either storing the data onto computer hard disks for later shipping, or streaming the digital data directly over a telecommunications network e.g. over the Internet to the correlator station. Radio arrays with a very broad bandwidth, and also some older arrays, transmit the data in <b>analogue</b> <b>form</b> either electrically or through fibre-optics. A similar approach is also used at some submillimetre and infrared interferometers, such as the Infrared Spatial Interferometer. Some early radio interferometers operated as intensity interferometers, transmitting measurements of the signal intensity over electrical cables to a central correlator. A similar approach was used at optical wavelengths by the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer {{to make the first}} large-scale survey of stellar diameters in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 Røde was {{approached}} by sound engineer Bruce Jackson to design a microphone system {{that could be used}} as the primary podium microphone for the Asian Games that year in Doha. The microphone has since appeared at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver,2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, 2010 Summer Youth Olympics in Singapore, 2011 Pan-Arab Games in Doha, 2011 Rugby World Cup in Auckland, 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics in London, and at the Olympics and Paralympics in Rio in 2016. Røde’s engineers designed the microphone system with two discrete microphone capsules in order to offer a high level of redundancy. The first capsule in the microphone stem sends audio directly to the broadcaster’s main digital audio network, using Røde designed preamps that are fed phantom power from an Optocore fibre network device. The second capsule is connected to a custom wireless system that is housed inside the actual lectern. This wireless system contains an RF transmitter, phantom power supply and transformer coupling amongst other components. The output is available both in <b>analogue</b> <b>form,</b> and sent to the analogue backup portion of the main audio system. It is also available in modulated RF format that is received by a radio mic receiver (or receivers) beneath the stage, and at the front-of-house (FOH) position. Originally three microphones were built, with one of these later being converted to a floor-standing unit.|$|E

In March, Ravi stated that the team had also shot in Rishikesh, Dehradun and that the third schedule was currently happening in Mussoorie. In June 2014, Raja revealed that the team were still yet to film scenes featuring the lead antagonist with reports linking either Arya or Arvind Swamy to the role, the pair however refuted the reports.

Finally, DNA topoisomerase inhibitors form single- or double-strand breaks in the DNA double helix, which relaxes the torsional stress that occurs when the DNA double helix unwinds. Accumulation of torsionally strained and supercoiled DNA interferes with vital cell processes leading to cytotoxic DNA damage causing cell arrest, apoptosis, or necrosis [38].|$|R
