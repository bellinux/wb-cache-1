40|$|Many {{biomedical}} {{studies of}} {{the past seven years}} have failed in giving a sound picture of what hookah (shisha, narghile, goza) smoke and smoking are. The reasons are many: from the widespread use of a confusing neologism (“waterpipe”) instead of the few clear and natural words used for centuries by indigenous and non-indigenous people in their real life, to the use of <b>artificial</b> <b>smoking</b> (machines) instead of relying on quantitative and qualitative analysis of toxicants directly performed on real hookah smokers...|$|E

Severe cases are a medical emergency, and {{are treated with}} glucocorticoids (steroids), and sometimes ciclosporin. Many anti-inflammatory biological mediators, such as infliximab, etanercept, and anakinra are being tried, {{but there are no}} randomized controlled trials demonstrating effectiveness.|$|R

No dose-response was observed with respect to quantity or duration of use or the two combined. No evidence was found to suggest that artificial sweeteners or diet beverages promote the tumorigenic effect of tobacco <b>smoking.</b> <b>Artificial</b> sweetener and diet beverage use strongly reflected socioeconomic status among controls with various diagnoses...|$|R
40|$|This draws global {{attention}} to the tobacco epidemic and to the preventable death and disease it causes. Tobacco use {{is one of the}} leading preventable causes of premature death, disease, and disability throughout the world [1]. Cigarette smoking is the most common form of tobacco consumption. Alarming statistics have recently emerged. An estimated 1. 2 billion people worldwide are smokers. In developing countries, half of all males smoke. The WHO projects a global smoking population of 1. 6 billion by the year 2030 [2]. An estimated 5 million deaths annually can be attributed to tobacco use. By 2030, estimates based on current trends indicate that this number will increase to 10 million, with 70 % of deaths occurring in low-and middleincome countries. The <b>artificial</b> passion for <b>smoking</b> killed 100 million people in the 20 th century. Without significan...|$|R
2500|$|With the {{exception}} of Quebec, all Canadian provinces have banned smoking indoors and outdoors in all their prison facilities. Prison officials and guards are sometimes worried due to previous events in other prisons concerning riots, fostering a cigarette black market within the prison, and other problems resulting from total prison smoking restrictions. Prisons have experienced riots when placing smoking restrictions into effect resulting in prisoners setting fires, destroying prison property, persons being assaulted, injured, and stabbed. One prison in Canada had some guards reporting breathing difficulties from the fumes of prisoners <b>smoking</b> <b>artificial</b> cigarettes made from nicotine patches lit by creating sparks from inserting metal objects into electrical outlets. [...] For example in 2008, the Orsainville Detention Centre near Quebec City, withdrew its smoke-free provision following a riot. But the feared increase in tension and violence expected in association with smoking restrictions has generally not been experienced in practice.|$|R
