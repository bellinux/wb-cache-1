5|$|Four {{significant}} changes to Highway3 {{have taken place}} since the designation of the route in 1920. The first was <b>an</b> <b>adjustment</b> to the eastern terminus. The second was the Essex Bypass, built through the 1970s between Windsor and Leamington. The third was the St. Thomas Expressway, a super two highway built in the late 1970s. The final change was the provincial highway transfers conducted in 1997 and 1998 that resulted in three segments of Highway3 being decommissioned: between Leamington and Talbotville Royale, through Port Colborne and within Fort Erie.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{manufacturing}} developments The Churchill Machine Tool Co {{experienced a}} lean period from 1921 to 1934, {{being unable to}} distribute a dividend on its ordinary share capital. The commencement of European rearmament from 1935 is given {{as the cause of}} a dramatic turnaround in fortunes. A dividend of 12% was paid in that year; in the following year it was quadrupled and there was a special dividend of 125%. <b>An</b> <b>adjustment</b> to the share capital was made, and in 1938 the dividend was 40%, with an additional scrip bonus of 33.3%. There was a subsequent fall in the yield to 30%, but in cash terms, allowing for capital restructuring, the payment remained the same.|$|E

50|$|The PAS defines an {{additional}} level of adjustment called the contact or surface level. At the surface level, {{there are four}} possible <b>adjustments.</b> <b>A</b> person who is not compensated may either become modified, that is, attempt to display the opposite of their primitive trait on the surface or they may remain completely uncompensated and unmodified, retaining their primitive trait. A person who is compensated at the basic level may revert towards their primitive trait on the surface (this is called <b>a</b> controlled <b>adjustment)</b> or continue to move towards the opposite (this is called a repressed adjustment).A person makes adjustments in all three dimensions independently.

5|$|Ultraviolet {{astronomy}} employs ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200Å (10 to 320nm). Light {{at those}} wavelengths are {{absorbed by the}} Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited {{to the study of}} thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue stars (OB stars) that are very bright in this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys. Other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, and active galactic nuclei. However, as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by interstellar dust, <b>an</b> <b>adjustment</b> of ultraviolet measurements is necessary.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland next faced San Francisco at home, winning 37–14 {{before one}} of the biggest crowds of the season. Chet Adams opened the scoring for the Browns with a 44-yard field goal; he and Lou Saban shared kicking duties in the game after Groza pulled his leg muscle during pre-game warmups. On the ensuing possession, Albert had the ball {{stripped}} by Cleveland's Weldon Humble, and the Browns took over and scored their first touchdown on a Graham pass to Lavelli. San Francisco scored a touchdown near the beginning of the second quarter, but Cleveland dominated the scoring thereafter. Lavelli caught seven passes for a total of three touchdowns, setting an AAFC single-game record. Graham also rushed for a one-yard touchdown and threw for 222 yards. His touchdown passes made him the league leader in that category, with 18 on the season. It was the biggest margin of victory the Browns had ever recorded against the 49ers. Cleveland was helped by <b>an</b> <b>adjustment</b> Paul Brown made in his receivers' routes; the coach had Lavelli and Speedie run toward {{the middle of the field}} instead of trying to get open near the sidelines, as they had done in past games. The victory clinched the AAFC's western division for the Browns and assured the team a spot in the championship game.|$|E
5|$|Each planet or moon has a mass, and {{therefore}} a gravitational pull, though they do not affect one another and only the single strongest pull affects the player's ship. This sometimes results in odd behavior; for example, the gravitational effect of Mars is much stronger than that of its moon Phobos. This means that a player attempting to land on Phobos needs to allow the ship to fall below the moon's surface until it is close enough to Phobos's center that Phobos's pull becomes the dominant force, {{at which point the}} ship snaps back to be landed on the surface. The name of the planet or moon with the current strongest pull is displayed on the screen. Players are able to edit the program to change the conditions; popular variations by the original players were increasing the gravity level and thus the difficulty, or <b>an</b> <b>adjustment</b> to the coordinate display system so that, rather than the ship staying {{in the center of the}} screen and the planets moving relative to it, the current dominant planet would always be at the bottom of the screen, with the ship moving relative to it.|$|E
30|$|To {{estimate}} the electricity demand function, this study adopts <b>a</b> partial <b>adjustment</b> approach (e.g., Cuddington and Dagher 2015), an effective method {{when dealing with}} datasets with micro panels such as a large J (number of groups) and small T (time series). Since our dataset covers {{a relatively short period}} (20  years), we believe <b>a</b> partial <b>adjustment</b> approach is suitable. However, most previous studies using <b>a</b> partial <b>adjustment</b> approach have failed to recognize the possibility of an endogenous lagged dependent variable in the regressors (Hosoe and Akiyama 2009). By contrast, this study accounts for this endogeneity to avoid any bias.|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion <b>an</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E

Trulli became the first front runner to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 39. Alesi retired when his engine failed on lap 40. Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Zonta, Coulthard, Villeneuve and Fisichella made their pit stops over the next three laps. Salo pulled into retirement after his engine failed on lap 42.
