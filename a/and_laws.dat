5|$|After the {{revolution}} in Russia in 1917, the communist movement gradually gained footholds in many countries around the world. In Europe and the US, communist parties were formed, generally allied with trade union and labor causes. During the First Red Scare of 1919–1920, many Americans were fearful that Bolshevism and anarchism would lead to disruption within the US. In the late 1930s, state and federal legislatures passed laws designed to expose communists, including laws requiring loyalty oaths, <b>and</b> <b>laws</b> requiring communists to register with the government. Even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a free-speech advocacy organization, passed a resolution in 1939 expelling communists from its leadership ranks.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} control Europe gained, {{as far as}} global trade, came several {{treaties}} <b>and</b> <b>laws.</b> In 1773, the Regulating Act was passed, regulating affairs of the company in India and London. In 1748, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended the War of the Austrian Succession, but failed to settle the commercial struggle between England and France in the West Indies, Africa and India. The treaty was an attempt at regulating trade and market expansion between the two regions, but was ultimately unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|Following the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658 – but {{in direct}} contradiction of its terms – the Swedish {{government}} in 1683 {{demanded that the}} leading social groups of Skåneland accept Swedish customs <b>and</b> <b>laws.</b> Swedish became the only language permitted in Church liturgy and in schools, religious literature in Danish was banned, and all appointed politicians and priests were required to be Swedish. However the last Danish bishop, Peder Winstrup remained {{in charge of the}} Diocese of Lund until his death in 1679. To promote further Swedish assimilation, the University of Lund was inaugurated in 1666; the inhabitants of Scania were not allowed to enroll in Copenhagen University until the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} that European {{settlers}} first arrived in South Africa in 1652, the country was divided on racial lines, in common with similar settlements. In contrast to other European colonies, racial distinction and segregation intensified during the early 20th century, and the various ethnic groups became more sharply defined and divided. Following its general election victory in 1948, the National Party, led by Daniel Malan, formalised this racism under a government policy called apartheid. Under apartheid, different races were kept apart {{in all aspects of}} life. This system was thoroughly enforced during the 1950s; any resistance from non-white races was put down <b>and</b> <b>laws,</b> supposedly to prevent the rise of communism, were passed to prevent political agitation.|$|E
5|$|Husbandry, {{especially}} if it is intensive, has a substantial environmental impact, occupying {{about a third of}} the earth's ice-free land, causing loss of habitat and emitting about half of all greenhouse gas worldwide. Since the 18th century, people have become increasingly concerned about the welfare of farm animals, <b>and</b> <b>laws</b> and standards are widely enforced in response. In culture, animal husbandry often has an idyllic image, featuring in children's books and songs, where happy animals live in attractive countryside. A similar image may be projected by petting farms and by historic farms that offer farmstays to paying visitors.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to recommendations from the governor, the General Assembly enacted cost-saving {{reforms in the}} judicial system, including the abolition of criminal, chancery, and common pleas courts, dividing the state instead into 18 circuit court districts. The number of jurors required for certain cases was reduced, juror salaries were set at a fixed rate, and penalties were established for soliciting jury duty. Reimbursement amounts for transporting and caring for prisoners were capped to prevent inflation of costs by local law enforcement. Salaries of state officials were reduced by 20 percent. The state property tax was also increased from 40 to 45 cents per $100 of taxable property, <b>and</b> <b>laws</b> were strengthened to facilitate the collection of delinquent taxes.|$|E
