500|$|The episode's {{opening scene}} depicts a fire fight during the Gulf War. This sequence, which took {{two days to}} film, was shot on a dry expanse of land located an hour outside of Los Angeles. This area had been {{selected}} due to its resembles to an Iraqi desert. Series' co-executive producer Michelle MacLaren said: [...] "We [...] were {{way out in the}} desert and we drove around this corner of these hills <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> we had entered another country. It was so desolate, and there were these stone buildings that looked like a bomb had gone off in them. It was perfect." [...] To add authenticity to the shoot, several of the extras used during this scene were former US military personnel.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, another rock genre, Britpop, {{emerged in}} part as a {{reaction}} against the dominance of grunge in the United Kingdom. In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by [...] "youthful exuberance and desire for recognition". The leading Britpop bands, [...] "Blur and Oasis exist as reactionary forces to [...] eternal downcast glare." [...] Britpop artists' new approach was inspired by Blur's tour of the United States {{in the spring of}} 1992.

500|$|In June 2011, it was {{announced}} that Russell Tovey would appear in Sherlock series two in its second episode. Tovey, who liked Sherlock for staying true to the style of the novels despite its modern twist, said of the experience: [...] "It's amazing {{to be a part of}} it", adding, [...] "I got to act with Benedict and Martin which was awesome". The actor also explained that during his scenes, [...] "We did about two and a half weeks of night shoots in Cardiff <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> I had jetlag." [...] In terms of Henry's character, Tovey did not want him to be a [...] "jibbering wreck", but rather mature and truthful as well as damaged and haunted. Gatiss also made Henry display signs of survivor guilt. Tovey's nephew auditioned for the part of a younger Henry, but another child actor was cast for the role as the nephew was considered too young.|$|E

500|$|Regarding {{his looks}} in the film, Ram Charan said, [...] "Personality wise there isn’t really much {{difference}} to Kalabhairava but I {{have to tell you}} minor changes like the shape of my mustache, a slight voice modulation, the background scale, the atmosphere and even the ‘Chandrabindu’ worked wonders on screen and gave a totally different look and feel <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it was an altogether different side of me. When I was told of the characterization of ‘Kalabhairava’, I had an impression of a young, passionate soldier and naturally it had to have a great body and an authoritative voice. So, we also worked on it. We actually went to Rajasthan and observed the local culture and their way of dressing, we researched a lot about their costumes, history and great personalities 400 years ago and planned it accordingly." [...] Ram Charan sported a long hairdo for both of his characters in the film.|$|E

500|$|... "Hair" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Gaga and RedOne, {{and the name}} of the song was revealed through an interview with Vogue magazine in February 2011. On The Graham Norton Show, Gaga explained the origin of the song, which involves the analogy of her hair with freedom, and how that is the only part of her body she can change without anyone judging her. According to a press listening in February, [...] "Hair" [...] draws inspiration from Pat Benatar's '80s classic [...] "We Belong", while thematically focusing on empowering lyrics similar to those of [...] "Born This Way". Gaga elaborated on the song's inspiration further with a video posted on her Twitter account: [...] "When I was a kid, I used to always come down the stairs of my parents' house, and they would say, 'Go back upstairs and brush your hair, change your clothes, you can't go out wearing that', <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it was stifling my identity...

500|$|Black soon {{signed with}} RCA {{at that time}} {{considered}} one of the [...] "most aggressive" [...] labels in country music. His first album, Killin' Time, was released in 1989. [...] Each song on the album was penned at least in part by Black; four of them were attributed solely to him, while the rest were collaborations with Nicholas. [...] In a departure from most other country albums, Black used his road band instead of session musicians to record Killin' Time. The album was a critical and commercial success, reaching number one on the Billboard Country Albums chart and certified platinum in 1990. He made his debut in 1989 with the single, [...] "A Better Man", which reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs in early June. This marked the first time in 14 years that a debut single by a male artist had peaked {{at the top of the}} chart. In total, five singles off of his debut album reached number one, the first time any country artist had accomplished this feat. Black won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for best newcomer in 1989. At the end of the year, his singles, [...] "A Better Man" [...] and [...] "Killin' Time" [...] place number one and number two on the year-end country singles charts. [...] It had been 36 years since another artist had claimed both top spots in a single year.

500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E

500|$|Following his transfer, Garland {{opened his}} stint with La Salle on December 15, 2012 in a road game against Bucknell, scoring 9 points in 22 minutes {{off the bench}} and {{recording}} 2 turnovers and 4 personal fouls. He did not {{take part in the}} team's earlier games because he was ineligible due to NCAA regulations regarding player transfers. In the game that followed, he posted a career-best 26 points as a bench player in a win over Iona. He also added 3 rebounds, an assist, and a steal in the 23 minutes he was on the court. In a seven-minute stretch in the second half, Garland scored 14 straight points. He said after the game, [...] "I used to do it in high school. It kind of felt like high school when I was out there; it just felt good". Garland, who led the Explorers in scoring, also received praise from head coach John Giannini. On December 22, 2012, he had another impactful performance vs Sacred Heart, with six assists in 31 minutes of play. This was also his first-ever start under Giannini. The coach commented about Garland, [...] "He's a very underrated passer. People think because he scored all those points in high school he's a scorer first and foremost. I think he's a very good passer". However, this would be his sole start in his junior year at La Salle. Garland was effective in the opening, First Four round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament against Boise State, finishing with a team-high 22 points and, in turn, scoring 20 or more points for the second time as a junior. After the game, Giannini told Garland, [...] "This is why I chased you all over the place, to win NCAA tournament games and see if you could be a great player". On March 23, 2014, against the Ole Miss Rebels, Garland made a scooping layup off the backboard with 2.5 seconds left in regulation to send La Salle into the Sweet 16 round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The game-winner was known as the [...] "Southwest Philly Floater," [...] following Garland's post-game comments, in which he said, [...] "That's the Southwest Philly Floater, man. Shoutout to my Cousin Bern, shoutout to my Mom". He made the shot in spite of defensive efforts from the Rebels' 6ft 9 in (2.06 m) center Reginald Buckner, who had blocked the Explorer multiple times in the game. Garland recalled the play, saying, [...] "Time was running out, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> I could get the drive. When I cut, I just saw an opening and took the ball up...I went in there and knew if I could get an open shot, I could make it". Following a defeat to Wichita State that ended the team's tournament run and their season, Garland was averaging 13.1 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 2 assists.|$|E

2500|$|After {{seeing them}} at SXSW, Robin Hilton of NPR's All Songs Considered {{described}} their sound as [...] "gloriously loud fuzzy rock."

He expanded, [...] "The complaint about Gen Xer's were they’re lazy and don’t care. They’re the whatever generation. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> when I {{was watching a}} lot of the younger bands at South by this year I really felt like that vibe is coming back.

He subsequently wrote for Insight on the News, a conservative magazine owned by Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church. In 1987, Gladwell began covering business and science for The Washington Post, where he worked until 1996. In a personal elucidation of the 10,000-hour rule he popularized in Outliers, Gladwell notes, [...] "I was a basket case at the beginning, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> an expert at the end.

She questioned her career path, feeling pressured by {{the demands of the}} entertainment industry, saying, [...] "People look at you differently, as if you're not human." [...] Abbie Kearse of MTV responded, [...] "You're creating a person who might not really be you, but you've created this fantasy woman, so when it's time to get back to business, it's like 'I've {{got to go back to}} that world'".

However the final version features just Norwood. Speaking on how the song came about Norwood said, [...] "Well, he had the song {{for a while and}} when I heard it, it really just spoke to me. Sometimes you get to a point in your life where you’re scared to be great, you’re scared to be beautiful, you’re scared to be the best version of you and you talk to yourself and you try to get yourself back on track.

2500|$|Blur were {{involved}} in a vibrant social scene in London (dubbed [...] "The Scene That Celebrates Itself" [...] by Melody Maker) [...] that focused on a weekly club called Syndrome in Oxford Street; the bands that met up were a mix of music styles, some would be labelled shoegazing, while others would go on to be part of Britpop. The dominant musical force of the period was the grunge invasion from the United States, which filled the void left in the indie scene by The Stone Roses' inactivity. Blur, however, took on an Anglocentric aesthetic with their second album Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993). Their new approach was inspired by a tour of the United States in the spring of 1992. During the tour, frontman Damon Albarn began to resent American culture and found the need to comment on that culture's influence seeping into Britain. Justine Frischmann, formerly of Suede and leader of Elastica (and at the time in a relationship with Damon Albarn) explained, [...] "Damon <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> we were in the thick of it at that point ... it occurred to us that Nirvana were out there, and people were very interested in American music, and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of Britishness." [...] John Harris wrote in an NME article just prior to the release of Modern Life is Rubbish, [...] " [...] timing has been fortuitously perfect. Why? Because, as with baggies and shoegazers, loud, long-haired Americans have just found themselves condemned to the ignominious corner labeled 'yesterday's thing'". The music press also fixated on what the NME had dubbed the New Wave of New Wave, a term applied to the more punk-derivative acts such as Elastica, S*M*A*S*H and These Animal Men.|$|E
