25|$|O’Sullivan and {{her colleagues}} {{assessed}} 180 girls {{between the ages of}} 12 and 14 on their perceptions on what their first sexual encounters would be like; many girls reported feeling negative emotions towards sex before their first time. The researchers think this is because adolescent girls are taught that society views adolescent pre-marital sex in negative terms. When they reported positive feelings, the most commonly listed one was feeling attractive. This shows how many girls objectify their own bodies and often think <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> they think of their own sexual desires and needs.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{drove down}} the highway and just before Cann River Les woke up. He {{wanted to know where}} we were. I told him we were in Victoria heading to Orbost. Les cracked the shits and was abusing me. He was saying {{he wanted to go to}} Sydney. He kept saying 'the bridge'. I took this to mean he wanted to throw the girls off the bridge because he had spoken <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>before.</b> There are some bridges on the way to Sydney on the Hume Highway which have great drops." ...|$|E

Runce looked at him to make sure whether {{he was the man}} who had uttered such fearful blasphemies at the breakfast-table.

50|$|There was {{considerable}} media commentary <b>about</b> <b>this</b> sculpture <b>before,</b> during, {{and after the}} trial. The court case was also {{the subject of a}} one-hour British television programme.|$|R
6000|$|He {{paused a}} moment or two to collect his thoughts, and then he {{answered}} her. [...] "Nina, I would wish to think <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> I speak of it more fully. What step I may next take I cannot say without considering it much. I would not wish to pain you if I could help it." ...|$|E
6000|$|A line {{caught his}} notice: [...] "Her husband's to Aleppo gone, {{the master of}} the Tiger." [...] Marston had not thought much <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>before,</b> but he saw the strange, high-pooped old vessel, manned by {{merchant}} adventurers, plunge across the surges of the Levant. She was a type; there were always merchant adventurers, and he pictured Columbine rolling on the African surf.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I will not," [...] he answered, [...] "but I shall talk to {{you again}} <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> we land. I mean to say that you must let me give you my card, and you will know, at any rate, that there is some one in England to whom you can send if you are in need of a friend." ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Army {{flag and}} ensign (14th-16th centuries)Historically, Bretons {{had used a}} black cross on a white ground, the inverse of Saint Piran's Flag of Cornwall. Little {{information}} is available <b>about</b> <b>this</b> flag <b>before</b> the 14th century.|$|R
50|$|After his playoff performances, {{head coach}} Joe Gibbs made the {{decision}} to start Smith in the Super Bowl, but only told <b>about</b> <b>this</b> to starting quarterback Doug Williams and few of his assistant coaches, in order to avoid rookie Smith being overwhelmed by the pressure. Smith was told <b>about</b> <b>this</b> decision <b>before</b> the pregame warmups.|$|R
2500|$|Nothing {{is known}} <b>about</b> <b>this</b> church <b>before</b> {{the conquest of}} Constantinople in 1453. The {{appellation}} [...] "troullos" [...] (Latin trullus, Italian trullo, dome) probably comes from a dome-roofed palace {{that used to be}} in the neighborhood. [...] The style of construction dates the building to the 12th century.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should tell}} you, Lady Eustace, that I had not a doubt <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> I came here. For some time past I {{have thought that}} it must be so; and latterly the confessions of two of the accomplices have made it certain to me. One of the housebreakers and the {{jeweller}} will be tried for the felony, and I am afraid that you must undergo the annoyance of being one of the witnesses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{all right}} now," [...] said Swanson. [...] "I'm {{authority}} enough so I {{know it was}} a waste of money, and it makes me tired to see you not wearing out a whole closetful of clothes you got already. I've expressed my idea <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>before,</b> and you know good and well you didn't pay the least bit of attention. I have to camp on your trail to get you to do anything--" ...|$|E
6000|$|She had {{relieved}} {{the faithful}} fulness of her heart, and modestly said, raising her eyes appealingly {{to her new}} friend's, 'I {{did not mean to}} say so much, nor have I ever but once spoken <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>before.</b> But it seems to set it more right than it was last night. I said I wished you had not followed me, sir. I don't wish it so much now, unless you should think--indeed I don't wish it at all, unless I should have spoken so confusedly, that--that you can scarcely understand me, which I am afraid may be the case.' ...|$|E
30|$|The {{course of}} active {{orthodontic}} treatment ranged between 10 and 12 [*]months. Only elastic ligatures were used. The patients were controlled every 4 [*]weeks. Brackets with bond failures and brackets with tie-wing fractures were replaced with metal brackets. Patients were informed <b>about</b> <b>this</b> procedure <b>before</b> {{the beginning of}} treatment.|$|R

[...] "No; {{you can stop}} out there--isn't all the prairie big enough for you? There'll be some tone <b>about</b> <b>this</b> place <b>before</b> I'm through," [...] and the cook grinned broadly as he caught my eye.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the Goodwins told {{investigators}} about Roth's having seduced their daughter {{and of a}} staged burglary he'd conducted on his own house in 1988 for insurance money, but had told nobody <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> {{because they were afraid}} of him. Roth had also carried on an affair with his son's babysitter for years, but her husband did nothing either for the same reason.|$|E
5000|$|For example some {{dialogue}} from [...] "Drive" [...] TORRES: How {{come you}} {{never talked to}} me <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>before?</b> PARIS: Well, youve got that tough Klingon exterior. And er, I didnt think you liked the mushy stuff. TORRES: Do I look that tough right now? PARIS: Does that mean youre {{in the mood for}} some mushy stuff? TORRES: Maybe. PARIS: Exactly what kind of mush are we talking about? TORRES: You tell me. PARIS: Well, theres, um, kissy stuff.|$|E

50|$|Pinin {{claims to}} be in love with a woman, but he does not write her, and seems very embarrassed by the Major's question. That's suspicious, and {{suggests}} that the Major may be right. Furthermore, when Pinin exits the Major's room, Tonani the adjutant smiles knowingly, as though he understands what transpired behind the closed door. Perhaps he and the Major had a conversation <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> the story began? Or maybe Tonani had a similar experience with the Major? This could be the Major's routine; he knows exactly what he wants, but is dedicated to being discrete and polite about it.|$|E
5000|$|Chris Daughtry {{performed}} {{this song}} on American Idol as a contestant in early 2006, which {{was during the}} period after longtime singer/guitarist Brett Scallions had left the group, prompting Fuel bassist Jeff Abercrombie and guitarist/songwriter Carl Bell to publicly ask Daughtry to be their new lead singer on the television show Extra. On the show Abercrombie stated [...] "Chris, if you are watching, we've talked <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>before,</b> {{and if you want}} to entertain it again we'll take it and go..." [...] Daughtry, although flattered, eventually declined the offer, opting to form his own band, Daughtry, instead.|$|E
50|$|Very little {{information}} exists <b>about</b> <b>this</b> area <b>before</b> 832, however {{it would seem}} that there was a parish by the name of Riedones which gave the town its name. In 832, Conwoion, a Breton monk {{with the help of the}} Carolingian Emperor Louis le Pieux founded the abbey of Saint-Sauveur de Redon. Today, documents relating to the life of the abbey still exist.|$|R
5000|$|Beliefs are {{sometimes}} divided into core beliefs (that are actively thought about) and dispositional beliefs (that may be ascribed {{to someone who}} has not thought about the issue). For example, if asked [...] "do you believe tigers wear pink pajamas?" [...] a person might answer that they do not, despite the fact they may never have thought <b>about</b> <b>this</b> situation <b>before.</b>|$|R
50|$|The deity {{depicted}} on page 9 of the Grolier Codex is the Mountain God with split head. This image was otherwise {{unknown in the}} 1960s.

Coe and his colleagues {{argue that it is}} very unlikely that a forger would have known <b>about</b> <b>this</b> deity <b>before</b> it was described elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|Mr. McMahon took on Bret Hart next, with Bruce Hart as {{the special}} guest referee. McMahon entered and {{informed}} Hart {{that he wanted}} to give him a [...] "WrestleMania sized" [...] screwing and called out Hart's family, asserted he had paid them to turn on Hart. Hart then informed McMahon that his family had informed him <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> and that they would screw Vince instead. The match included members of the Hart family including The Hart Dynasty beating on McMahon. Hart then placed McMahon in the Sharpshooter, with McMahon tapping out to end the match.|$|E
5000|$|You're {{different}} now. You {{can think}} for yourself. So think <b>about</b> <b>this.</b> <b>Before,</b> {{you were a}} mindless thing. Nothing could hurt you. You couldn't feel pain, much less understand it. But once you have felt it—it changes you—forever. And you'll begin to understand something new. Fear. I've lived with it all my life. You don't want to die again, do you? The agony of what's happened to you affects your speed—your strength...and that little bit of doubt—that you cannot win today—grows. You understand now, don't you? You will never hurt me again. You will never kill me again. Never again! ...|$|E
5000|$|Together, {{they arrive}} at the eye-shaped {{building}} they saw on their arrival to Lucky Smells. Dr. Orwell, seemingly friendly, lets them in, and tells Violet and Sunny {{to sit in the}} waiting room. Violet and Sunny wonder <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> realizing that Count Olaf is disguised as Shirley, a receptionist. She also learns that Klaus has been (and is being) hypnotized by Orwell, who is in cahoots with Olaf. They leave with Klaus, who is once again in a trance, and calls Violet [...] "Veronica." [...] When they return to the lumbermill, they find a memo from Sir informing them that if there is another accident, he'll place them under Shirley's care.|$|E
6000|$|... "And so he will, and it'll {{be a great}} {{temptation to}} me to know where I can get it so easily. But {{he was telling me}} all <b>about</b> <b>this</b> woman <b>before</b> I thought of my own concerns--and I didn't like to be talking to him of what I wanted myself, when he'd been asking a favour of me. It would be too much like looking for payment." ...|$|R

6000|$|Perhaps the greenest cabbage-leaf ever {{grown in}} a garden was wrapped <b>about</b> <b>this</b> steak, <b>before</b> it was {{delivered}} over to Tom. But the butcher had a sentiment for his business, and knew how to refine upon it. When he saw Tom putting the cabbage-leaf into his pocket awkwardly, he begged {{to be allowed to}} do it for him; 'for meat,' he said with some emotion, 'must be humoured, not drove.' ...|$|R
