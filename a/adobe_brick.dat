5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, Isdud was {{described}} as a village spread across the eastern slope of a low hill, covered with gardens. A ruined khan stood southwest of the village. Its houses were one-storey high with walls and enclosures built of <b>adobe</b> <b>brick.</b> There were two main sources of water: a pond and a masonry well. Both were surrounded by groves of date-palm and fig-trees.|$|E

25|$|The 20th century {{ranch house}} style {{has its roots}} in North American Spanish colonial {{architecture}} of the 17th to 19th century. These buildings used single story floor plans and native materials in a simple style {{to meet the needs of}} their inhabitants. Walls were often built of <b>adobe</b> <b>brick</b> and covered with plaster, or more simply used board and batten wood siding. Roofs were low and simple, and usually had wide eaves to help shade the windows from the Southwestern heat. Buildings often had interior courtyards which were surrounded by a U shaped floor plan. Large front porches were also common. These low slung, thick-walled, rustic working ranches were common in the Southwestern states.|$|E
25|$|Acoma Pueblo {{has three}} rows of three-story, apartment-style {{buildings}} which face south {{on top of}} the mesa. The buildings are constructed from <b>adobe</b> <b>brick</b> with beams across the roof that were covered with poles, brush, and then plaster. The roof for one level would serve as the floor for another. Each level is connected to others by ladders, serving as a unique defensive aid; the ladders are the only way to enter the buildings, as the traditional design has no windows or doors. The lower levels of the buildings were used for storage. Baking ovens are outside the buildings, with water being collected from two natural cisterns. Acoma also has seven rectangular kivas and a village plaza which serves as the spiritual center for the village.|$|E
25|$|The upper creek {{originates}} {{in the historic}} Rancho La Purisima Concepcion, which was granted by Governor Alvarado in 1840 to Jose Gorgonio, an Indian living at Mission Santa Clara. Gorgonio moved {{to the west bank}} of Adobe Creek near Fremont Avenue in Los Altos Hills. Much of the town of Los Altos Hills, California was located on this Rancho. In 1844 Rancho La Purisima Concepcion was sold to Juana Briones de Miranda, whose family members had accompanied both the Gaspar de Portolà and the Juan Bautista de Anza Expeditions. Her uniquely constructed wood-framed, rammed-earth and <b>adobe</b> <b>brick</b> house, believed to have been built by American desertee sailors, is located at 4155 Old Adobe Road on the border between Palo Alto and Los Altos Hills, and is marked by a historical marker at the corner of Old Adobe Road and Old Trace Lane. Designated a California State Historical Landmark in 1954, the 160-year-old Juana Briones home was scheduled for demolition in 2007 because of damage to it by the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. In 2009, it still stands and has been recently documented with a Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS).|$|E

2500|$|From the 1880s {{through the}} 1920s, the adobe {{was left to}} the {{elements}} and fell into severe disrepair, with whole wings of the house being washed away and the walls and roof crumbling. [...] The dilapidated condition of the adobe is shown in 1938 photographs seen [...] and [...] [...] In 1934, the City of Pomona purchased the land for a reservoir, and the Historical Society of Pomona Valley began plans for restoration of the old adobe. [...] In {{the spring and summer}} of 1939, 70 WPA workers began the process of restoring the adobe. [...] The workers used dirt from the Ganesha Gills for adobe mud to build new <b>adobe</b> <b>bricks.</b> [...] The <b>adobe</b> <b>bricks</b> were made using straw as the only binder, molding the bricks in forms by hand, and curing the bricks in the sun. [...] Approximately 25,000 new <b>adobe</b> <b>bricks</b> were used in the restoration process. The cost of the restoration was placed at $54,000. [...] Many of the bricks were made from the broken original <b>adobe</b> <b>bricks,</b> and the new bricks can reportedly be distinguished by the short lengths of straw used to mix with the mud, while marsh grass can be seen in the old <b>adobe</b> <b>bricks.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Camilo Ynitia (alternative {{spelling}} [...] "Camillo"; original native name transliterated as [...] "Hueñux") {{was born}} in 1803, probably in the Miwok village of Olompali (located just north of present-day Novato, California) where his father had built an <b>adobe</b> <b>brick</b> home. Camilo was a notable leader of the Coast Miwok, a Native American people. Camilo {{was known as the}} last Hoipu (headman) of the Miwok community living at Olompali. Camilo was also the only Native American on the northern frontier of Alta California to secure and keep a large Mexican-era land grant: In 1843 Governor Manuel Micheltorena of Alta California deeded him the Rancho Olompali, a large tract of land that is between present-day Novato and Petaluma, California. A part of this land now comprises the Olompali State Historic Park.|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} {{sustainable}} construction {{has continued to}} generate momentum, in particular, finding alternative to steel reinforcement and concrete construction. In present research, the mechanical properties of adobe have been sought {{to serve as the}} alternative. In addition, several fibrous materials were combined with adobe and investigated for its strength. To ensure the long-term durability of adobe, this study investigated thoroughly the effect of jute fibre on the strength of <b>adobe</b> <b>bricks</b> and a conclusion was drawn. The developed composite shows a positive correlation between jute fibre addition and strength of <b>adobe</b> <b>bricks.</b> The compressive strength increased significantly with the addition of jute fibre and the minimum compressive strength achieved satisfied the strength requirement for <b>adobe</b> <b>bricks...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Several {{historic}} buildings remain in Harshaw, although most are {{on private property}} belonging to the Hale Ranch. [...] The most prominent building still standing is the James Finley House, now preserved and listed on the National Register of Historic Places as of November 19, 1974. Built around 1877 as a residence for the superintendent of the Hermosa Mine, the house was located just [...] from the Hermosa Mill. When the mine was later purchased by James Finley, he took up residence in the house. The house is important historically {{as one of the}} few remaining buildings from Harshaw's mining heyday, and architecturally as a representation of period building styles in Arizona Territory. Notably, the house is of red brick construction rather than the <b>adobe</b> <b>brick</b> used in most other period buildings.|$|E
2500|$|From 1967–69, renovations were undertaken: the {{original}} <b>adobe</b> <b>brick</b> chimney, which was crumbling, was removed; the front doorway was widened; and, in 1968, a dormer was added {{on the north}} side of the structure. Additional remodeling occurred from 1976–78 when additional bedrooms were created by enclosing the screened porch {{on the north side}} of the building, as well as remodeling of the existing bedrooms and bathroom. The rooms upstairs were also remodeled at this time, as well as the switching of the locations of the dining room and kitchen, which were also updated. A statue of St. Francis, was installed in a small alcove next to the front door in 1980, brought in from the church in Lukachukai. Also in 1980, a mudroom by the rear entrance was also added. [...] A ﬁreplace was added to the south wall of the Friary’s living room on December 1, 1981, with a triple walled chimney pipe.|$|E
60|$|The town, when I was there, was a {{place of}} two or three streets, {{economically}} paved with sea-sand, and two or three lanes, which were water-courses in the rainy season, and at all times were rent up by fissures four or five feet deep. There were no street lights. Short sections of wooden sidewalk only added to the dangers of the night, for they were often high above the level of the roadway, and no one could tell where they would be likely to begin or end. The houses were for the most part built of unbaked <b>adobe</b> <b>brick,</b> many of them old for so new a country, some of very elegant proportions, with low, spacious, shapely rooms, and walls so thick that the heat of summer never dried them to the heart. At the approach of the rainy season a deathly chill and a graveyard smell began to hang about the lower floors; and diseases of the chest are common and fatal among house-keeping people of either sex.|$|E
