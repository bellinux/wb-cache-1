40|$|Chronic {{paronychia}} is {{an inflammatory}} disorder of the nail folds of a toe or finger presenting as redness, tenderness, and swelling. It is recalcitrant dermatoses seen commonly in housewives and housemaids. It is a multifactorial inflammatory {{reaction of the}} proximal nail fold to irritants and allergens. Repeated bouts of inflammation lead to fibrosis of proximal nail fold with poor generation of cuticle, which in turn exposes the nail further to irritants and allergens. Thus, general preventive measures form cornerstone of the therapy. Though previously <b>anti-fungals</b> were the mainstay of therapy, topical steroid creams {{have been found to}} be more effective in the treatment of chronic paronychia. In recalcitrant cases, surgical treatment may be resorted to, which includes en bloc excision of the proximal nail fold or an eponychial marsupialization, with or without nail plate removal. Newer therapies and surgical modalities are being employed in the management of chronic paronychia.

40|$|AbstractThe {{zebrafish}} embryotoxicity test (ZET) is a {{fast and}} simple method to study chemical toxicity after {{exposure of the}} complete vertebrate embryo during embryogenesis in ovo. We developed a novel quantitative evaluation method to assess {{the development of the}} zebrafish embryo based on specific endpoints in time, the general morphology score (GMS) system. For teratogenic effects a separate scoring list was developed. The relative effects of eight glycol ethers and six 1, 2, 4 -triazole <b>anti-fungals</b> were evaluated in this system and results were compared with in vivo developmental toxicity potencies. Methoxyacetic acid and ethoxyacetic acid appeared as the most potent glycol ether metabolites, inducing growth retardation and malformations. Other glycol ethers showed no developmental toxicity. Flusilazole appeared the most potent triazole, followed by hexaconazole, cyproconazole, triadimefon, myclobutanil and triticonazole, respectively. In general, the potency ranking of the compounds within their class in the ZET was comparable to their in vivo ranking. In conclusion, the ZET with the GMS system appears an efficient and useful test system for screening embryotoxic properties of chemicals within the classes of compounds tested. This alternative test method may also be useful for the detection of embryotoxic properties of other classes of chemicals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Fungal {{infections are}} an {{emerging}} health risk, especially those involving yeast that {{are resistant to}} antifungal agents. To understand the range of mechanisms by which yeasts can respond to <b>anti-fungals,</b> we compared gene expression patterns across three evolutionarily distant species - Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida glabrata and Kluyveromyces lactis - over time following fluconazole exposure. Results Conserved and diverged expression patterns were identified using a novel soft clustering algorithm that concurrently clusters data from all species while incorporating sequence orthology. The analysis suggests complementary strategies for coping with ergosterol depletion by azoles - Saccharomyces imports exogenous ergosterol, Candida exports fluconazole, while Kluyveromyces does neither, leading to extreme sensitivity. In support of this hypothesis we find that only Saccharomyces becomes more azole resistant in ergosterol-supplemented media; that this depends on sterol importers Aus 1 and Pdr 11; and that transgenic expression of sterol importers in Kluyveromyces alleviates its drug sensitivity. Conclusions We have compared the dynamic transcriptional responses of three diverse yeast species to fluconazole treatment using a novel clustering algorithm. This approach revealed significant divergence among regulatory programs associated with fluconazole sensitivity. In future, such approaches {{might be used to}} survey a wider range of species, drug concentrations and stimuli to reveal conserved and divergent molecular response pathways...|$|R
25|$|However, some {{of these}} cultivars, notably those with the Siberian Elm U. pumila in their ancestry, lack the forms for which the iconic American Elm and English Elm were prized.

25|$|DED {{is caused}} by a micro-fungus {{transmitted}} by two species of Scolytus elm-bark beetle which act as vectors. The disease affects all species of elm native to North America and Europe, but many Asiatic species have evolved <b>anti-fungal</b> genes and are resistant. Fungal spores, introduced into wounds in the tree caused by the beetles, invade the xylem or vascular system. The tree responds by producing tyloses, effectively blocking the flow from roots to leaves. Woodland trees in North America are not quite as susceptible to the disease because they usually lack the root-grafting of the urban elms and are somewhat more isolated from each other. In France, inoculation with the fungus of over three hundred clones of the European species failed to find a single variety possessed of any significant resistance.|$|E
25|$|Mucormycosis is {{commonly}} contracted via inhalation of spores resulting in rhinocerebral and pulmonary mucormycoses but infection with Apophysomyces variabilis is contracted cutaneously. Apophysomyces species cause infections {{of the skin}} and soft-tissue following injuries such as burns, automotive accidents, surgeries, and injections both intramuscular and subcutaneous. Cutaneous mucormycosis is acquired when the sporangiospores from contaminated soil and water {{come into contact with}} broken skin. For this reason, disease is seen in burn patients, injured persons, and injection-drug users. The infection may take clinical forms such as necrotizing fasciitis, cerebritis, rhinoorbital infections, and kidney infections. Successful treatment depends on early detection of infection, surgical debridement of necrotic tissues, and <b>anti-fungal</b> therapy with drugs such as posaconazole and amphotericin B. Members of the order Mucorales generally infect immunocompromised patients but A. variabilis infections tend to occur in immunocompetent healthy hosts.|$|E
40|$|Free drug {{measurement}} and pharmacodymanic markers provide {{the opportunity for}} a better understanding of drug efficacy and toxicity. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) -mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful analytical technique that could facilitate the measurement of free drug and these markers. Currently, there are very few published methods for the determination of free drug concentrations by HPLC-MS. The development of atmospheric pressure ionisation sources, together with on-line microdialysis or on-line equilibrium dialysis and column switching techniques have reduced sample run times and increased assay efficiency. The availability of such methods will aid in drug development and the clinical use of certain drugs, including anti-convulsants, anti-arrhythmics, immunosuppressants, local anaesthetics, <b>anti-fungals</b> and protease inhibitors. The history of free drug {{measurement and}} an overview of the current HPLC-MS applications for these drugs are discussed. Immunosuppressant drugs are used as an example for the application of HPLC-MS in the measurement of drug pharmacodynamics. Potential biomarkers of immunosuppression that could be measured by HPLC-MS include purine nucleoside/nucleotides, drug-protein complexes and phosphorylated peptides. At the proteomic level, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight (TOF) MS is a powerful tool for identifying proteins involved in the response to inflammatory mediators.

While diagnostic and therapeutic interventions have improved greatly during this period, increases {{in the number of}} patients with neutropenia, changes in the etiologic agents involved, and growing antibiotic resistance have continued to be problematic. The evolving etiology of infections in this patient population is reviewed by Dr. Donowitz. Presently accepted antibiotic regimens and prac-tices are discussed, along with ongoing controver-sies. In Section II, Drs. Maki and Crnich discuss line-related infection, which is a major infectious source in the neutropenic. Defining true line-related bloodstream infection remains a challenge despite the fact that various methods to do so exist.

40|$|Sphingolipids are {{essential}} components of eukaryotic cell membranes, particularly the plasma membrane, and {{are involved in}} a diverse array of signal transduction pathways. Mammals produce sphingomyelin (SM) as the primary complex sphingolipid via the well characterised SM synthase. In contrast yeast, plants and some protozoa utilise an evolutionarily related inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC) synthase to synthesise IPC. This activity has no mammalian equivalent and IPC synthase has been proposed as a target for <b>anti-fungals</b> and anti-protozoals. However, detailed knowledge of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway of the apicomplexan protozoan parasites was lacking. In this study bioinformatic analyses indicated a single copy orthologue of the putative SM synthase from the apicomplexan Plasmodium falciparum (the causative agent of malaria) was a bona fide sphingolipid synthase in the related model parasite, Toxoplasma gondii (TgSLS). Subsequently, TgSLS was indicated, by complementation of a mutant cell line, to be a functional orthologue of the yeast IPC synthase (AUR 1 p), demonstrating resistance to the well characterised AUR 1 p inhibitor aureobasidin A. In vitro, recombinant TgSLS exhibited IPC synthase activity and, for the first time, the presence of IPC was demonstrated in T. gondii lipid extracts by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, host sphingolipid biosynthesis was indicated to influence, but be non-essential for, T. gondii proliferation, suggesting that whilst scavenging does take place de novo sphingolipid synthesis may be important for parasitism...|$|R
