40|$|Amino acid {{sequence}} {{analysis of a}} b 4 light chain from a rabbit homogeneous <b>antistreptococcal</b> <b>antibody</b> revealed the presence of two amino acid substitutions in the constant region not previously reported for these positions. These interchanges, consisting of serine for alanine at position 121 and leucine for glutamine at position 124, were also present in about 30 % of the pooled b 4 light chains isolated from pooled IgG from the rabbit (4539) that produced the homogeneous antibody. In addition, these interchanges (b 4 var) were found, always at the same levels, in varying percentages in nonimmune or early immune bleedings from related rabbits in this pedigreed family and could be traced for five generations. The inheritance pattern of b 4 var was consistent with autosomal codominant inheritance...|$|E
40|$|Generation {{of local}} and {{systemic}} immune responses by the oral administration of antigens is frequently inefficient, requiring large quantities of immunogens and yielding only modest antibody responses. In this study, we have demonstrated that oral administration of microgram amounts of Streptococcus mutans protein antigen I/II covalently coupled to the B subunit of cholera toxin elicits vigorous mucosal as well as extramucosal immunoglobulin A and G <b>antistreptococcal</b> <b>antibody</b> responses in mice. These responses were manifested {{by the presence of}} large numbers of antibody-secreting cells in salivary glands, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleens and by the development of high levels of circulating antibodies. This novel immunization strategy may find broad application in the construction of oral vaccines for the control of infectious diseases caused by pathogens encountered at mucosal and extramucosal sites...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a low}} {{frequency}} of idiotypic cross-reactions among antibodies of the same specificity from different outbred rabbits (1 - 4). When such cross-reactions do occur they are generally weak and involve {{a small proportion of}} the antiidiotypic antibody population (5, 6). This generalization applies also to rabbits belonging to the same family group (2, 7). Contrasting results were reported by Eichmann and Kindt (8), who investigated a family of rabbits consisting of a brother-sister mating pair and their F ~ and F 2 descendants. The mating pair was chosen {{on the basis of the}} capacity of both rabbits to produce high titers of <b>antistreptococcal</b> <b>antibody</b> of restricted heterogeneity. Antistreptococcal antibodies elicited in several members of the family group exhibited strong idiotypic cross-reactivity. In mice of an inbred strain, idiotypic cross-reactions are more common. They have been observed among BALB/c myeloma proteins with antibody activity directed to the phosphoryl choline hapten group (9, 10). These same myeloma proteins also share idiotypic determinants with antiphosphoryl choline antibodies induced by immunization of some BALB/c mice with pneumococci (9).

It was found that about 45 % of the related rabbits, when immunized with streptococcal Group C vaccine, produced antibodies with a cross-reactive idiotype, while less than 10 % of similarly immunized unrelated rabbits produced molecules bearing HId. The expression of HId was linked to the a 3 allotype present in the H chain allogroup J. Antibody molecules bearing the HId determinant were isolated from heterozygous (a 1 a 3 and a 2 a 3) rabbits and shown to express the a 3 allotype.

Chorea occurred without any history of fever or infection, and rapidly worsened over 3 weeks. Examination was otherwise normal.

40|$|The {{observation}} (1) that {{inhibition of}} HLA cytotoxicity by streptococcal antigens was, in reality, due to consumption of complement (C) by these antigens prompted us to further investigate {{the mechanism of}} this consumption. Several possibilities for this anticomplementary activity were considered. Since human sera often contain antibodies {{to a number of}} streptococcal antigens, a specific interaction between bacterial structures and their corresponding antibodies was conceivable. In general, antigen-antibody complexes trigger the classical pathway, but there have been recent reports (2) of activation of the alternate pathway by these complexes as well. The evidence against specific antibody as the main mechanism of C consumption was the observation that the preincubation of streptococcal membranes with rabbit C yielded the most significant loss of C activity. Although unlikely, the possibility that rabbit sera contain <b>antistreptococcal</b> <b>antibodies</b> could not be completely excluded. Secondly, while we suspected that streptococcal cellular structures were responsible for the activation, one had to consider that other substances eithe...|$|R
40|$|Antigens shared between Streptococcus pyogenes {{and heart}} tissue may play an {{important}} role in autoimmune cardiac injury associated with acute rheumatic fever. Antiheart/antistreptococcal antibodies found in the disease react with antigens of S. pyogenes, including M protein and a 60 -kDa antigen distinct from M protein. Heart antigens recognized by these cross-reactive <b>antistreptococcal</b> <b>antibodies</b> include myosin and actin. To investigate the presence of a streptococcal actin, established protocols for the polymerization and isolation of eukaryotic actin were used to extract and concentrate actinlike proteins from M- streptococcal cells. The polymerized bacterial actin from the streptococcal extract was probed in immunoblots with an antiactin monoclonal antibody. Two proteins of about 60 kDa in the polymerized bacterial actin reacted with the antiactin antibody. Proteins in the polymerized bacterial actin extract of about 43 and 60 kDa behaved like eukaryotic actin by binding to myosin and DNase I affinity columns. Filaments were demonstrated by electron microscopy in the polymerized bacterial actinlike extract, which also enhanced the ATPase activity of eukaryotic myosin. The data suggest that proteins resembling actin are present in S. pyogenes...|$|R
40|$|The term "individual {{antigenic}} specificity " {{is used to}} denote antigenic determinants present on and characteristic of individual, homogeneous, "monodonal " T-globulins. In G myeloma proteins, these antigenic determinants {{are present in the}} Fab fragment (1, 2). Similar antigenic determinants are present in antibodies induced by deliberate immunization, e. g. in human 3,G-type anti-A, anti-dextran, and anti-levan (3) and in rabbit anti-Salmonella typki (4), anti-Proteus (5) and <b>antistreptococcal</b> <b>antibodies</b> (6). Individually specific antigenic determinants are also referred to as idiotypic antigenic determinants (7, 8). Since these antigenic determinants are present in the same fragment of ~,G-globulin as the antigen binding sites, their study is of major interest concerning the relationship between antibody structure and specificity. Individually specific antigenic determinants were originally demonstrated in monodonal ~,M-globulin by Habich (9). They are present in monodonal 7 M-globulins with antibody activity, e. g. in cold aggintinins (3, 10, 11, 12), and in monodonal ~,Mglobulins without any known antibody activity (9, 13, 14, 15).

40|$|The role of {{allotype}} {{recognition in}} the regulation of the expression of latent allotypes has been investigated in two series of experiments. The first experiments were designed to investigate the apparent instability of latent allotypes in circulation. In these experiments, clearance rates of IgG preparations bearing allotypes matched and unmatched to the recipient were examined. In all cases, iodinated IgG matched in allotype to the recipient was cleared at a normal rate from the serum. However, in several cases, iodinated IgG of an unmatched allotype was cleared at a rate and in a manner suggesting prior sensitization of the recipient to IgG of that allotype. Such apparent sensitization correlated {{with the presence of}} the foreign allotypes as a latent allotype in several bleedings taken {{both before and after the}} clearance experiment. In the second series of experiments, designed to test the ability of antiallotype antibodies to affect the expression of latent allotypes, five rabbits were immunized first with purified antiallotype antibodies and then after 3 - 4 mo, with streptococcal vaccine. Examination of the <b>antistreptococcal</b> <b>antibodies</b> for latent allotype revealed, in all cases, that the allotype against which the antiallotype antibodies were directed was present in levels 8 - to 20 - fold greater than were observed before the antiallotype injections. These results indicate that recognition of allotypic determinants is an important element in the control of latent allotype expression and suggest the existence of a regulatory network involving antiallotype antibodies...|$|R
40|$|Myeloma {{proteins}} (1) and antibodies {{of a given}} specificity (2, 3) {{produced in}} an individual animal possess individually specific or "idiotypic " (4) antigenic determinants. 1 Idiotypic cross-reactions among antibodies of the same specificity from different individual rabbits or humans are infrequent (2, 3, 5, 6) and are generally weak when they do occur (7). Eichmann and Kindt (8), however, recently reported strong cross-reactions among the <b>antistreptococcal</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{of some of the}} rabbits of a family group. These rabbits were descended from a brother-sister mating pair {{selected on the basis of}} production of antibodies of limited heterogeneity in response to streptococcal cell wall antigens. There is evidence that idiotypic cross-reactions may be more frequent among mice of an inbred strain than among rabbits. Cohn et al. (9) prepared antiidiotypic antibodies in an A/J mouse against a BALB/c myeloma protein with antibody-like activity against pneumococcal C carbohydrate. Antisera to C carbohydrate prepared in 6 of 10 normal BALB/c mice formed precipitates with the antiidiotypic antiserum in the Ouchterlony test. The intensities of the precipitin lines were weaker with the cross-reacting sera than with the myeloma protein used as immunogen and lines of identity were not demonstrated. In addition, idiotypic cross-reaction was noted with another myeloma protein with anti-C carbohydrate activity. Potter and Lieberman (10) examined eight BALB/c myeloma proteins which bind phosphorylcholine and found that five share idiotypic determinants, giving lines of identity in the Ouchterlony test.

40|$|N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is {{the major}} immunoepitope of group A streptococcal cell wall carbohydrates. <b>Antistreptococcal</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{cross-reactive}} with anti-GlcNAc and laminin are present in sera of patients with rheumatic fever. The cross-reactivity of these antibodies with human heart valvular endothelium and the underlying basement membrane has been suggested to be a possible cause of immune-mediated valve lesion. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) encoded by the MBL 2 gene, a soluble pathogen recognition receptor, has high affinity for GlcNAc. We postulated that mutations in exon 1 of the MBL 2 gene associated with a deficient serum level of MBL may contribute to chronic severe aortic regurgitation (AR) of rheumatic etiology. We studied 90 patients with severe chronic AR of rheumatic etiology and 281 healthy controls (HC) for the variants of the MBL 2 gene at codons 52, 54, and 57 by using a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism-based method. We observed {{a significant difference in}} the prevalence of defective MBL 2 alleles between patients with chronic severe AR and HC. Sixteen percent of patients with chronic severe AR were homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for defective MBL alleles in contrast to 5 % for HC (P = 0. 0022; odds ratio, 3. 5 [95 % confidence interval, 1. 6 to 7. 7]). No association was detected with the variant of the MASP 2 gene. Our study suggests that MBL deficiency may contribute to the development of chronic severe AR of rheumatic etiology.

40|$|Background: Some {{cases of}} Tourette's {{syndrome}} (TS) are hypothesized {{to be caused}} by autoantibodies that develop in response to a preceding group A beta hemolytic streptococcal infection. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we looked for the presence ot total and IgG antibodies against neural, nuclear, cytoskeletal and streptococcal epitopes using indirect immunofluorescent assays and Western blot techniques in three patient groups: TS (n = 81), SC (n = 27), and a group of autoimmune disorders (n = 52) and in normal controls (n = 67). Subjects were ranked after titrations of autoantibodies from 0 to 227 according to their level of immunoreactivity. Results: TS patients had a significantly higher mean rank for total antineural and antinuclear antibodies, as well as antistreptolysin 0 titers. However, among children and adolescents, only the total antinuclear antibodies were increased in TS patients compared to age matched controls. Compared to SC patients, TS patients had a significantly lower mean rank for total and IgG class antineural antibodies, significantly lower IgG class anticytoskeletal antibodies, and a significantly higher rank for total antinuclear antibodies. Compared to a mixed group of autoimmune disorders, the TS patients had a significantly lower mean rank for total and IgG class antineural antibodies, total and IgG class antinuclear antibodies, IgG class anticytoskeletal antibodies, and a significantly higher rank for <b>antistreptococcal</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Conclusions: TS patients had significantly higher levels of total antineural and antinuclear antibodies than did controls. Their relation to IgG class antineural and antinuclear antibodies, markers for prior streptococcal infection, and other clinical characteristics, especially chronological age, was equivocal.

40|$|Idiotypic {{determinants}} {{are present}} on myeloma proteins (1) and on induced antibodies (2, 3), {{where they are}} characterized by their association with antibody of a given specificity. Shared determinants are ordinarily not detectable in nonspecific IgG, 1 in preimmune serum, nor in antibodies of other specificities from the same animal. As would be predicted, idiotypic determinants are localized in the Fab fragment of immunoglobulin molecules (6). In many antibodies {{the region of the}} active site appears to be an important idiotypic determinant, as shown by the capacity of specific haptens to inhibit the reaction with anti-idiotypic antibody (7 - 10). 2 Complete blocking by haptens is generally not observed, which suggests the presence of additional idiotypic determinants on the Fab fragment. This is supported by the capacity of Fab fragments from some, although not all, immunoglobulins to form specific precipitates with their anti-idiotypic antibodies (11); this property would require antigenic multivalence. Mice of an inbred strain are frequently observed to produce antibodies of a given specificity with shared idiotype.
