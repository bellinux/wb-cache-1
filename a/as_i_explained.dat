Afterwards, another protester, who had climbed {{the steps of the}} gantry where the BBC were broadcasting to film the protest on a mobile phone, said: [...] "You should be ashamed of yourself, mate. Shame on you!" [...] Robinson replied [...] "I'm not remotely ashamed of myself. Why should I be ashamed of myself?" [...] He wrote in his blog afterwards: [...] "I lost my temper and I regret that. However, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> afterwards to the protesters who disrupted my broadcast, there are many opportunities to debate whether the troops should be out of Afghanistan without the need to stick a sign on a long pole and wave it in front of a camera". Some days later, Robinson read out a jokily ambiguous [...] "letter of apology" [...] on the comedy game show Have I Got News for You, broadcast on 4 November 2010.|$|E

60|$|There {{were other}} cases I could have recited showing the ill recompense {{that so often}} overtakes the virtuous action; but, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> to Bute, it would have saddened me to dwell upon the theme.|$|E
60|$|But, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explain</b> to them, {{it is the}} law of {{literature}} never to write except about what you really know. I want to mix with the aristocracy, study them, understand them; so that I may earn my living in the only way a literary man nowadays can earn his living, namely, by writing about the upper circles.|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} matrix {{is usually}} {{defined as a}} two-dimensional array of scalars. And yet, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explain,</b> matrices are not in fact two-dimensional arrays. So are we to conclude that matrices do not exist? I show how to resolve the puzzle, for both contemporary and older mathematics. The solution generalises to the interpretation of all mathematical discourse. The paper as a whole attempts to reinforce mathematical structuralism by reflecting {{on how best to}} interpret mathematics...|$|R
6000|$|... "Failing that, sir," [...] the {{professor}} declared, [...] "my point is, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> before, that Beatrice should give {{up one of}} her songs. What you have said this evening more than ever confirms me in my view." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] said Flambeau, [...] "that you've {{got some}} notion in your head, but it won't easily get the bullet out of his. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> before, he might {{easily have been}} strangled. But he was shot. By whom? By what?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It hasna a guid name after dark, yon hoose," [...] remarked my companion, {{slackening}} {{his pace}} perceptibly <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> {{to him the}} nature of our errand. [...] "It's no for naething that him wha owns it wunna gang within a Scotch mile o't." ...|$|E
50|$|From the {{headquarters}} of the Republican Guard, the commander of the Cross, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explain</b> later, the captain had instructed him to come with reinforcements to jail. But he added that, harassed, had remained barricaded until the attack ended.However, the large windows of the barracks had suffered no broken glass, there was no visible bullet impacts on walls. Once the PIP, could only have been shot on the ledge of his headquarters.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{had better}} listen to me, my dear. I don't {{think you did}} quite {{understand}} it. It {{would have been very}} odd if you had, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> never <b>explained</b> it to you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] replied Stephen with enthusiasm; [...] "that is, not exactly, {{but it is}} all {{the same}} thing, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> will <b>explain</b> later. But, Miss Hope, {{meanwhile}} could you show us the Flower?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{thing was}} certain: that rascally old fox {{would have to}} do some digging before he could get at us, and I ran back to Mrs. Rabbit, who had pulled herself {{together}} a bit, holding her gently by the ears <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> what was going on." ...|$|E
60|$|I felt {{from the}} first I was going to like him. He is shy, and that, of course, makes him appear awkward. But, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> to Robina, it is the shy young men who, {{generally}} speaking, turn out best: few men {{could have been more}} painfully shy up to twenty-five than myself.|$|E
60|$|Dejah Thoris went {{aboard the}} flagship, and was much put out that I would not follow, but, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> to her, {{the battle was}} but partly won; we still had the land forces of the besieging Zodangans to account for, and I would not leave Tars Tarkas until that had been accomplished.|$|E
40|$|Finsler metrics are Berwald; {{this claim}} solves the long-standing “unicorn ” problem. Unfortunately, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explain</b> below, {{the proof of}} the {{statement}} has a gap. Following [2], let us consider a smooth n−dimensional manifold M with a proper Finsler metric F: TM → R. The second differential of 1 2 F 2 |TxM will be denoted by g = g(x,yx) and {{should be viewed as}} a Riemannian metric on the punctured tangent space TxM − { 0 }. For a smooth curve c(t) connecting two points a, b ∈ M, we denote b...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable Development is a {{holistic}} concept {{based on a}} simple principle. As outlined in the 1987 Brundtland report, the concept involves “development that {{meets the needs of}} the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. This report explains how an effective way to operationalize the concept of sustainable development in the corporate world is to apply what John Elkington called the “triple bottom line. ” 1 This strategy maintains its first focus on an operation’s profitability, but it also includes people and environment, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explain</b> in this report...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not seek}} honour in it, mademoiselle, but--I must say it--justice. The engagement, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>explained,</b> is not of my seeking. It has been thrust upon me, and in honour I cannot draw back." ...|$|R
60|$|Upon its further bank we took counsel, for now we {{had entered}} the {{territory}} of the Fung, and were {{face to face with the}} real dangers of our journey. Fifty miles or so away rose the fortress of Mur, but, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> to my companions, the question was how to pass those fifty miles in safety. Shadrach was called to our conference, and at my request set out the facts.|$|E
6000|$|... "No idea at all, Sir Wingrave," [...] {{the lawyer}} declared. [...] "Your wishes have been {{strictly}} carried out, most strictly. She imagines {{that it is}} some unknown connection of her father. But, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> to you in my letter, she has recently exhibited {{a good deal of}} curiosity in the matter. She is--er--a young lady of considerable force of character for her years, and her present attitude--as I explained in my letter--is a trifle difficult." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] Hunterleys assured his questioner. [...] "For {{anything}} I know to the contrary, you are, {{outside the}} world of finance, one of the dullest and most harmless men existing. My own position is simply <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> it {{during the first few}} sentences we exchanged. I do not like you, I detest my wife's name being associated with yours, and for that reason, the less I see of you the better I am pleased." ...|$|E

60|$|These mere {{domestic}} episodes are, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{have already}} <b>explained,</b> introduced only because I cannot avoid alluding to them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, I mean utterly without it. The pages {{you want}} altered contain, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> to you very lucidly, I think, the very raison d'etre of the work, {{and it would}} therefore, it seems to me, be an imbecility of the first {{magnitude}} to cancel them." [...] Peter had really renounced all hope that his critic would understand what he meant, but, under favour of circumstances, he couldn't forbear to taste the luxury, which probably never again would come within his reach, of being really plain, for one wild moment, with an editor.|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{night when}} {{tied to the}} mast, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained,</b> we were pumping on, {{deafened}} with the wind, and without spirit enough in us to wish ourselves dead, a heavy sea crashed aboard and swept clean over us. As soon as I got my breath I shouted, as in duty bound, 'Keep on, boys!' when suddenly I felt something hard floating on deck strike the calf of my leg. I made a grab at it and missed. It was so dark we could not see each other's faces within a foot--you understand.|$|E
60|$|So I set my {{face against}} the sea trip. Not, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained,</b> upon my own account. I was never queer. But I was afraid for George. George said he should be all right, and would rather like it, but he would advise Harris and me {{not to think of}} it, as he felt sure we should both be ill. Harris said that, to himself, it was always a mystery how people managed to get sick at sea—said he thought people must do it on purpose, from affectation—said he had often wished to be, but had never been able.|$|E
6000|$|He is politely {{curious about}} us; {{and from time}} to time, in a [...] shrinking, disgusted way, he asks some leading {{question}} about [...] Eriecreek, which he doesn't seem able to form any idea of, as much [...] <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explain</b> it. He clings to his original notion, that it is in the [...] heart of the Oil Regions, of which he has seen pictures in the [...] illustrated papers; and when I assert myself against his opinions, he [...] treats me very gingerly, <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> were an explosive sprite, or an [...] inflammable naiad from a torpedoed well, and it wouldn't be quite [...] safe to oppose me, or I would disappear with a flash and a bang.|$|R

Signs on the doors tell me to sign in at the main office, but the there are no {{directions}} to the main office. I ask a girl walking by; she points down a hallway to my left. As I walk I notice the floors are old; some of the tiles cracked and dirty. In the main office the principal, to whom I have spoken on the phone but never seen, rushes past me just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explain</b> to someone behind the desk that I have an appointment with her. 2 ̆...|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{you must}} not suppose that I have always been poor. I have had my periods of wealth, but, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> to you before, it was very difficult, {{on account of the}} {{frequent}} necessity of changing my place of residence, as well as my identity, to carry over my property from one set of conditions to another. However, I have often been able to do this, and at one time I was in comfortable circumstances for nearly two hundred years. But generally, when I found myself obliged to leave a place where I had been living, for fear of suspicion concerning my age, I had to leave everything behind me.|$|E
60|$|The {{truth of}} this story I cannot vouch for. Myself, I can believe it. Brown and MacShaughnassy {{made no attempt to}} do so, which seemed unfriendly. Jephson excused himself on the plea of a headache. I admit there are points in it {{presenting}} difficulties to the average intellect. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> at the commencement, it was told to me by Ethelbertha, who had it from Amenda, who got it from the char-woman, and exaggerations may have crept into it. The following, however, were incidents that came under my own personal observation. They afforded a still stronger example of the influence exercised by Tommy Atkins upon the British domestic, and I therefore thought it right to relate them.|$|E
60|$|The {{jersey and}} the shoes {{my mother and}} I {{purchased}} that very day, for the fear was upon me that unless we hastened, the last blue and white striped jersey in London might be sold, and the market be empty of running shoes. That evening, before getting into bed, I dressed myself in full costume to admire myself before the glass; and from then {{till the end of}} the week, to the terror of my mother, I practised leaping over chairs, and my method of descending stairs was perilous and roundabout. But, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> to them, the credit of the Lower Fourth was at stake, and banisters and legs equally of small account as compared with fame and honour; and my father, nodding his head, supported me with manly argument; but my mother added to her prayers another line.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I outline my {{thinking}} to date <b>as</b> <b>I</b> pursue my doctoral studies. I describe the {{context within which}} I work {{and the reasons for}} my research and I offer an account of my reflections on how and why I have come to the position where I feel the need to and the rightness of theorising and conceptualising my practice as a Senior Lecturer in Education. I describe how I have, through an MA dissertation (Renowden, 2006), and will, through a PhD thesis, offer an account of my living theories of practice <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explain</b> how and why I hold myself accountable for my working life. I will show how, through these acts of accountability, and others, I am coming to create my living educational theories of practice and work towards the development of an epistemology of accountability.

40|$|What is a {{normative}} reason for acting? In this paper, I introduce and defend a novel {{answer to this}} question. The starting-point is the view that reasons are right-makers. By exploring difficulties facing it, I arrive at an alternative, according to which reasons are evidence of respects {{in which it is}} right to perform an act, for example, that it keeps a promise. This is similar to the proposal that reasons for a person to act are evidence that she ought to do so; however, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>explain,</b> it differs from that proposal in two significant ways. As a result, I argue, the evidence-based account of reasons I advance shares the advantages of its predecessor while avoiding many of the difficulties facing it...|$|R
