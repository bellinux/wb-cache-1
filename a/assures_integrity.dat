40|$|Les fonctions biologiques sont le résultat de l'interaction de beaucoup de processus, avec différents objectifs, complexités, niveaux de hiérarchie, et changements de {{conditions}} que modifient le comportement de systèmes. Nous utilisons des équations différentielles ou dynamiques plus générales, et systèmes stochastiques de transition pour décrire la dynamique de changements des modèles. La composition, réconciliation et réutilisation des modèles nous permettent d'obtenir des descriptions de systèmes biologiques complètes et compatibles et leur combiner. Notre spécification de systèmes hybrides avec BioRica assure l'intégrité de modèles, et implémente notre approche. Nous appliquons notre approche pour décrire in-silico deux systèmes: la dynamique de la fermentation du vin, et des décisions cellulaires associées à {{la formation}} de tissu d'os. The main {{aim of this}} thesis is to develop an approach {{that allows us to}} describe biological systems with theoretical sustenance and good results in practice. Biological functions are the result of the interaction of many processes, that connect different hierarchy levels going from macroscopic to microscopic level. Each process works in different way, with its own goal, complexity and hierarchy level. In addition, it is common to observe that changes in the conditions, such as nutrients or environment, modify the behavior of the systems. So, to describe the behavior of a biological system over time, it is convenient to combine different types of models: continuous models for gradual changes, discrete models for instantaneous changes, deterministic models for completely predictable behaviors, and stochastic or non- deterministic models to describe behaviors with imprecise or incomplete information. In this thesis we use the theory of Composition and Hybrid Systems as basis, and the BioRica framework as tool to model biological systems and analyze their emergent properties in silico. With respect to Hybrid Systems, we considered continuous models given by sets of differential equations or more general dynamics. We used Stochastic Transition Systems to describe the dynamics of model changes, allowing cofficient switches that control the parameters of the continuous model, and strong switches that choose different models. Composition, reconciliation and reusing of models allow us to build complete and consistent descriptions of complex biological systems by combining them. Compositions of hybrid systems are hybrid systems, and the refinement of a model forming part of a composed system results in a refinement of the composed system. To implement our approach ideas we complemented the theory of our approach with the improving of the BioRica framework. We contributed to do that giving a BioRica specification of Hybrid Systems that <b>assures</b> <b>integrity</b> of models, allowing composition, reconciliation, and reuse of models with SBML specification. We applied our approach to describe two systems: wine fermentation kinetics, and cell fate decisions leading to bone and fat formation. In the case of wine fermentation, we reused known models that describe the responses of yeasts cells to different temperatures, quantities of resources and toxins, and we reconciled these models choosing the model with best adjustment to experimental data depending on the initial conditions and fermentation variable. The resulting model can be applied to avoid process problems as stuck and sluggish fermentations. With respect to cell fate decisions the idea is very ambitious. By using accurate models to predict the bone and fat formation in response to activation of pathways such as the Wnt pathway, and changes of conditions affecting these functions such as increments in Homocysteine, one can analyze the responses to treatments for osteoporosis and other bone mass disorders. We think that here we are giving a first step to obtain in silico evaluations of medical treatments before testing them in vitro or in vivo.

However, users, when they don’t have the physical {{possession of the}} data, chances of raising data integrity issue are possible. Thus, verification of data integrity is the at most important for a user, who has outsourced data to the cloud. To make the integrity check, a public auditing must be made possible. For it, we resort to a Third Party Auditor (TPA). Also, the auditing process should not bring in further more burdens to the user. In this paper, we propose a secure cloud storage for which we integrate the technique of Homomorphic linear authenticator with random masking.

50|$|A hash {{function}} is any function {{that can be}} used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size. The values returned by a {{hash function}} are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. One use is a data structure called a hash table, widely used in computer software for rapid data lookup. Hash functions accelerate table or database lookup by detecting duplicated records in a large file. An example is finding similar stretches in DNA sequences. They are also useful in cryptography. A cryptographic hash function allows one to easily verify that some input data maps to a given hash value, but if the input data is unknown, it is deliberately difficult to reconstruct it (or equivalent alternatives) by knowing the stored hash value. This is used for <b>assuring</b> <b>integrity</b> of transmitted data, and is the building block for HMACs, which provide message authentication.|$|R

The slag cement-based grout withstands a gamma irradiation dose of 4. 77 MGy over 256 h without reduction in its compressive strength; however, some cracking of irradiated samples was identified.

In this study, we propose a secure data aggregation technique with reliable nodes using key predicate test protocol for sensor network. This technique specialize some nodes as Reliable nodes (R-nodes) to monitor the process of aggregation. Initially, for each node, a secret key is shared between base station and neighboring nodes. Then, an aggregation tree is constructed for transmitting data to the base station in a hierarchical fashion. The aggregator encrypts the data using secret key and forwards to a level up aggregator in aggregation tree. By enhancing broadcasting feature of R-nodes, the aggregated value is verified for ensuring integrity. As keys are shared between neighboring nodes, the nodes are validated using self-key predicate test. The proposed technique is proved through simulation results. It increases the throughput by reducing the packet drops significantly...|$|R
