Judges in each court serve a six-year term. The Judge of the Circuit Court appoints a referee to handle family law cases.|$|E
5|$|Marriage was {{considered}} the normal state for <b>all</b> <b>adult</b> residents of the colony. Most men first married in their mid-twenties and women around age 20. Second marriages were not uncommon, and widows and widowers faced social and economic pressures to remarry. On average, most widows and widowers remarried within {{six months to a}} year. Most adults who reached marriageable age lived into their sixties, so effectively two-thirds of a person's life was spent married.|$|E
5|$|Nearly <b>all</b> <b>adult</b> caddisflies are terrestrial, {{but their}} larvae and pupae are aquatic. They share this {{characteristic}} with several distantly-related groups, namely the dragonflies, mayflies, stoneflies, alderflies and lacewings. The ancestors {{of all these}} groups were terrestrial, with open tracheal systems, convergently evolving different types of gills for their aquatic larvae as they took to the water to avoid predation.|$|E

5|$|The soft, dense {{feathers}} {{are kept}} in good condition by preening. The red waxy tips are the extended and flattened ends of feather shafts, pigmented with astaxanthin and enclosed in a transparent sheath. A study of the cedar waxwings showed that the red tips are few or absent until {{the third year of}} life for that related species. <b>All</b> <b>adult</b> waxwings have a complete moult annually between August and January. Juveniles moult at the same time but retain their flight and some other wing feathers.|$|E
5|$|Civil service examinations: In the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), the xiaolian {{system of}} {{recruiting}} government officials through formal recommendations {{was the chief}} method of filling bureaucratic posts, although there was an Imperial Academy to train potential candidates for office and some offices required its candidates to pass formal written tests before appointment. However, {{it was not until}} the Sui Dynasty (581–618) that civil service examinations became open to <b>all</b> <b>adult</b> males not belonging to the merchant class (although having wealth or noble status were not requirements) and were used as a universal prerequisite for appointments to office, at least in theory. The civil service system was implemented on a much larger scale during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), when an elite core of dynastic-founding and professional families lost their majority in government to a broad strata of lesser gentry families from throughout the country.|$|E

5|$|Farmwork {{combined}} with lessons {{from his mother}} — such was the order of Jan's life {{for the next few}} years. During his early childhood, still too young to be given formal responsibilities on the farm, Jan accompanied the Coloured farm labourers as they went about their daily work. At this time the relations between master and servant, between black and white, were certainly not based on social equality; nevertheless, on these Swartland farms there was little of the rigid segregation which was already emerging elsewhere in South Africa and which was later to have such profound consequences. Since 1828 the Cape had enshrined in law the principle of strict legal equality between the races. Unlike the rest of South Africa, <b>all</b> <b>adult</b> males, were entitled to vote and to stand for election to the Colonial legislature, subject only to a property qualification. In these country districts therefore, there existed a certain intimacy between the farm owners and their labourers. At harvest times it was common to find both working together to gather in the crops and it was also commonplace to find the farm's children playing with one another, irrespective of race.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, {{millions}} of returning soldiers were still {{not entitled to}} vote. This posed another dilemma for politicians since they could {{be seen to be}} withholding the vote from the very men who had just fought to preserve the British democratic political system. The Representation of the People Act 1918 attempted to solve the problem, enfranchising <b>all</b> <b>adult</b> males {{as long as they were}} over 21 years old and were resident householders. It also gave the vote to women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications. The enfranchisement of this latter group was accepted as recognition of the contribution made by women defence workers, though the actual feelings of members of parliament (MPs) at the time is questioned. In the same year the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 allowed women over 21 to stand as MPs.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} vote for the Transkei Legislative Assembly, {{established}} in 1963 for the Transkei bantustan, was granted to <b>all</b> <b>adult</b> citizens of the Transkei, including women. Similar provision was made for the Legislative Assemblies created for other bantustans. <b>All</b> <b>adult</b> coloured citizens were eligible {{to vote for the}} Coloured Persons Representative Council, which was established in 1968 with limited legislative powers; the council was however abolished in 1980. Similarly, <b>all</b> <b>adult</b> Indian citizens were eligible to vote for the South African Indian Council in 1981. In 1984 the Tricameral Parliament was established, and the {{right to vote}} for the House of Representatives and House of Delegates was granted to <b>all</b> <b>adult</b> Coloured and Indian citizens, respectively.|$|E

25|$|In 1840, the Kingdom of Hawai'i adopted full {{suffrage}} to all adults, including women, but in 1852 rescinded female voting.

This legislation also allowed women to run for government, making Australia the first in the world to allow this. In 1906 Finland became the next nation in the world to give <b>all</b> <b>adult</b> citizens full suffrage, in other words the right to vote and to run for office. New Zealand granted <b>all</b> <b>adult</b> citizens the right to vote (in 1893), but women did not get the right to run for the New Zealand legislature until 1919.|$|E
