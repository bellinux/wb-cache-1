25|$|As league entered <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>century,</b> the Neftchi Baku found {{themselves}} facing new challengers. They were challenged by emerging Khazar Lankaran, Inter Baku and Baku in both competitions. The country's football received major blow in 2002, when UEFA imposed a two-year ban {{in response to}} a long-standing conflict between the Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan and majority of the country's top flight clubs. The domestic championship was abandoned {{as a result of the}} conflict and the top clubs prevented their players from playing for the national team, with tax officials also probing allegations of fraud at the Azerbaijan federation. Under the management of Agaselim Mirjavadov, Khazar Lankaran finished as Azerbaijan Cup winners in 2006 and 2007, while becoming league champions in 2006–07 despite losing the title to Neftchi in 2004–05 during Championship play-off. Qarabağ was the first ever team from Azerbaijan to reach UEFA Europa League play off-round during the seasons 2009–10 and 2010–11. Few gave chances for qualification to the next round, although the Aghdam side caused quite a stir against favorites Rosenborg, Honka, Twente and Wisła Kraków.|$|E

500|$|As king, Edward {{played a}} role in the {{modernisation}} of the British Home Fleet and the reorganisation of the British Army after the Second Boer War. He reinstituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised. He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries, especially France, for which he was popularly called [...] "Peacemaker", but his relationship with his nephew, the German Emperor Wilhelm II, was poor. The Edwardian era, which covered Edward's reign and was named after him, coincided with the start of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>century</b> and heralded significant changes in technology and society, including steam turbine propulsion and the rise of socialism. He died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the Parliament Act 1911, which restricted the power of the unelected House of Lords.|$|E
500|$|It was {{not until}} 2004, fifteen years {{after the fall of}} the regime, that the {{theological}} writings started being reprinted. These events also signified that the full corpus of his literature could see print: work on his complete writings was taken up by Mariana and Victor Iova. Prăbușirea and other manuscripts only saw print in and after 1997. The project ended in 2002 and, Voncu notes, Agârbiceanu returned to a [...] "discouraging anonymity" [...] until 2014, when Ilie Rad began work on a revised critical edition. This also included material never published in the Pienescu edition—adding as much as 75% new content. As suggested by Manolescu in 2013, Agârbiceanu once seemed [...] "the most promising Transylvanian writer of the dawn of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>century,</b> after Coșbuc and before Rebreanu." [...] However, and despite Fefeleaga being a constant feature of literature textbooks, Agârbiceanu became [...] "two-thirds forgotten".

2500|$|In the AD year {{numbering}} system, whether {{applied to}} the Julian or Gregorian calendars, AD 1 is preceded by 1 BC. There is no year [...] "0" [...] between them. Because of this, {{most experts agree that}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>century</b> begins in a year which has [...] "01" [...] as the final digits (e.g., 1801, 1901, 2001). New millennia likewise are considered to have begun in 1001 and 2001. This is at odds with the much more common conception that centuries and millennia begin when the trailing digits are zeroes (1800, 1900, 2000, etc.); for example, the worldwide celebration of the new millennium took place on New Year's Eve 1999, when the year number ticked over to 2000.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Horn, Morley, and Dudley {{began talking}} about the {{original}} intent of the project, its relevance in 20th-century music, and the impending turn of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>century.</b> The group temporarily reformed, adding guitarist Lol Creme, but without J.J. Jeczalik and Gary Langan. [...] Their engineering, programming and production tasks were carried out by dance act Way Out West. An album was recorded – Balance – Music for the Eye – but was never released, although several tracks from this project were included on the 2010 retrospective album Influence. and the whole album was released as part of [...] "At The End Of The Century" [...] box set.

2500|$|In 1800, James McGready {{stood at}} the {{juncture}} of two centuries, looking backward to the traditions of his spiritual fathers and forward to children of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>century</b> in a young republic. [...] The segment of the Second Great Awakening that arose from the concert of voices he led, stood {{in the shadow of}} the First, when republican ideals deferred to a king and revival fervor emanated primarily from the voices of preachers wearing clerical collars or holding seminary degrees. [...] McGready witnessed both the fracturing and stagnation of Presbyterianism in Kentucky, as well as the flowering of new forms of religious expressions thriving at the grass roots, where Bible reading, hymn singing, camp meetings and revival preaching were primary expressions of religious piety and feeling, reflecting the doctrines of the new birth among the common people. [...] Largely as a result of the revival, religion was less hierarchical and controlled than in the preceding century, as well as more democratic and diverse.|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, {{the notion}} that the missionary efforts of the Witnesses would culminate {{before the turn of the}} century was first reaffirmed, then abandoned. As first published, a Watchtower article of January 1 stated: [...] "The apostle Paul was spearheading the Christian missionary activity. He was also laying a {{foundation}} for a work that would be completed in our 20th century." [...] (Emphasis added.) Nine months later a more cautiously worded statement appeared in the Watchtower: [...] "We have ample reasons to expect that this preaching will be completed in our time. Does that mean before the turn of a new month, a new year, a new decade, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>century?</b> No human knows" [...] (emphasis added). In later bound volumes of the 1989 Watchtower magazines, the text of the January 1 article was amended to state that Christian missionary work [...] "would be completed in our day" [...] rather than [...] "in our 20th century".|$|E

On August 9, 2000, their 19th single [...] "Not Found" [...] was also used as the theme song to the Japanese drama , followed a month later by their 9th original album Q on September 27, 2000. The band went to New York to record this album, where they re-recorded some of their old indie material and for the first time, producer Takeshi Kobayashi performed with the band on a recording. The cover for the album was shot bought Size, Inc. at the Bonneville Salt Flats in the United States. The album was not a favorite amongst fans for various reasons and became their first album since Atomic Heart to not sell over one million copies. ‘Concert tour Q’ started, visiting 13 cities and holding 35 concerts between October 15, 2000 and February 24, 2001.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{facelift}} in 1981 {{gave the}} Regal {{a much more}} aerodynamic profile, helping {{make it possible for}} the car to compete on the NASCAR racing circuit. [...] The sloping hood and nose of the car made it the favorite of several NASCAR teams. [...] Richard Petty drove one to victory in the 1981 Daytona 500, and the car won a majority of the 1981 and 1982 seasons races and won the NASCAR manufacturers title in 1981 and 1982. V8s for street use were still available, but had shrunk to [...] (1980 and 1981 only, Pontiac built), and the V6 was rapidly gaining popularity. In 1982, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>Century</b> appeared on the front-wheel drive A-body, but the former rear-wheel drive Century sedan and wagon were not discontinued. These models were simply rebadged as Regals, {{and for the first time}} the name appeared on a full model lineup. The wagon was discontinued after 1983, and the sedan dropped from the lineup the next year. From 1986 to 1987, the 5.0 L 307 V8 was available as an option. [...] The 3.8 2-bbl V6 was standard.

60|$|It {{seems to}} me, you lay your finger {{here on the}} heart of the world's maladies, when you call it a Sceptical World. An insincere world; a godless untruth of a world! It is out of this, as I consider, that the whole tribe of social pestilences, French Revolutions, Chartisms, and what not, have derived their being,--their chief {{necessity}} to be. This must alter. Till this alter, nothing can beneficially alter. My one hope of the world, my inexpugnable consolation in looking at the miseries of the world, is that this is altering. Here and there one does now find a man who knows, as of old, that this world is a Truth, and no Plausibility and Falsity; that he himself is alive, not dead or paralytic; and that the world is alive, instinct with Godhood, beautiful and awful, even as in the beginning of days! One man once knowing this, many men, all men, must by and by come to know it. It lies there clear, for whosoever will take the spectacles off his eyes and honestly look, to know! For such a man the Unbelieving Century, with its unblessed Products, is already past; <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>century</b> is already come. The old unblessed Products and Performances, as solid as they look, are Phantasms, preparing speedily to vanish. To this and the other noisy, very great-looking Simulacrum with the whole world huzzaing at its heels, he can say, composedly stepping aside: Thou art not true; thou art not extant, only semblant; go thy way!--Yes, hollow Formulism, gross Benthamism, and other unheroic atheistic Insincerity is visibly and even rapidly declining. An unbelieving Eighteenth Century is but an exception,--such as now and then occurs. I prophesy that the world will once more become sincere; a believing world; with many Heroes in it, a heroic world! It will then be a victorious world; never till then.|$|E
