2500|$|Protein {{precipitate}} formation {{occurs in a}} stepwise process. [...] First, a precipitating agent is added and the solution is steadily mixed. [...] Mixing causes the precipitant and protein to collide. Enough mixing time is required for molecules to diffuse across the fluid eddies. [...] Next, proteins undergo a nucleation phase, where submicroscopic sized protein aggregates, or particles, are generated. Growth of these particles is under Brownian diffusion control. Once the particles reach a critical size (0.1 µm to 10 µm for high and low shear fields, respectively), by diffusive addition of individual protein molecules to it, they continue to grow by colliding into each other and sticking or flocculating. This phase occurs at a slower rate. During the final step, called aging in a shear field, the precipitate particles repeatedly collide and stick, then break apart, until a stable mean particle size is reached, which is dependent upon individual proteins. The mechanical strength of the protein particles correlates with {{the product of the}} mean shear rate and the <b>aging</b> <b>time,</b> which is known as the Camp number. Aging helps particles withstand the fluid shear forces encountered in pumps and centrifuge feed zones without reducing in size.|$|E

30|$|The same {{phenomenon}} {{was also}} found in experiments on Al-Cu brazed joints by Feng and Xue (2013).

40|$|A {{series of}} copper zinc oxide {{catalysts}} {{have been prepared}} using a co-precipitation procedure by varying the <b>ageing</b> <b>time</b> in the precipitation liquor.

All the catalysts exhibited ambient temperature CO oxidation activity and the <b>ageing</b> <b>time</b> is important in controlling the catalyst activity. The most active catalysts were aged for 165 min. Characterisation by powder X-ray diffraction showed that the catalyst precursors were sensitive to <b>ageing</b> <b>time.</b> It was also evident that <b>ageing</b> <b>time</b> influenced the precursor morphology. The calcined catalysts were all comprised of CuO and ZnO.

40|$|Abstract. Quartzite microcrystallite glass {{ceramics}} {{is one of}} the most promising machinable ceramic materials due to its many outstanding properties. The density of quartzite microcrystallite {{glass ceramics}} is smaller than the aluminum alloy and its thermal conductivity approaches to the zirconia and its elastic module is also very small; All these advantages meet the requirements for structural components to work at higher temperature; Compressive properties of quartzite microcrystallite glass ceramics had been studied at room temperature and 500 °C in this paper; The specimens had been aged at 1000 °C for 5, 10, 20, 30 hours, respectively. Through SEM observations of the fracture surface of the specimens, the microstructural changes had been determined; The tests showed: the compressive property of the machinable glass ceramic declined as the <b>ageing</b> <b>time</b> increasing; but the compressive property of the specimen aged for 10 hours was inferior to that aged for 20 hours; Then compressive property declined as the <b>ageing</b> <b>time</b> increasing. The SEM observation indicated that with the extend of <b>ageing</b> <b>time,</b> the grains grew bigger and microporous and microcracks increased in the specimens; Comparing the compressive property at room temperature with that at 500 °C, one found that the change of compressive property was very small when the <b>ageing</b> <b>time</b> was the same; With the extend of <b>ageing</b> <b>time,</b> the curve of the compressive property changed from smooth curves to broken lines...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the time response of 3 -stage artificial ageing treatments on strength properties of recycled Al-Si-Cu alloy with a view to obtaining useful empirical relationships for predicting required treatment cycles. True compressive stress, micro hardness and strain (%) were evaluated in response to <b>ageing</b> <b>time</b> and repeated <b>ageing.</b> The results of compression and hardness tests showed that alloy hardness and compressive stress increased with <b>ageing</b> <b>time,</b> and that these properties also increased with repeated ageing. The results also showed that alloy strain (%) reduced with <b>ageing</b> <b>time</b> and repeated <b>ageing,</b> indicating increasing strength or strain hardening of the alloy with repeated ageing. Using these results, empirical models of the form ϕn = ϕ 0 eαt, and ϕn = ϕ 0 eαN are established for predicting the required <b>ageing</b> <b>time</b> and/or number of ageing treatments to raise the strength (or hardness) of an alloy to desired levels to meet service requirements.
