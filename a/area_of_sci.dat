40|$|ABSTRACT: It {{is argued}} that {{emotions}} are lawful phe-nomena and thus {{can be described in}} terms of a set of laws of emotion. These laws result from the operation of emotion mechanisms that are accessible to intentional control to only a limited extent. The law of situational meaning, the law of concern, the law of reality, the laws of change, habituation and comparative f eling, and the law of hedonic asymmetry are proposed to describe mo-tion elicitation; the law of conservation of emotional mo-mentum formulates emotion persistence, " the law of closure expresses the modularity of emotion; and the laws of care for consequence, of lightest load, and of greatest gain per-tain to emotion regulation. For a long time, emotion was an underprivileged area in psychology. It was not regarded as a major <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>sci...</b>|$|E
40|$|Definitions and {{measures}} of supply chain integration (SCI) are diverse. More empirical research, with clear definition and appropriate measures are needed. The {{purpose of this article}} is to identify dimensions and variables for SCI and develop an integrated framework to facilitate this. A literature review of the relevant academic papers in international journals in Logistics, Supply Chain Management and Operations Management for the period 1995 - 2009 has been undertaken. This study reveals that information integration, coordination and resource sharing and organisational relationship linkage are three major dimensions for SCI. The proposed framework helps integrate both upstream suppliers and downstream customers with the focal organisation. It also allows measuring SCI using both qualitative and quantitative approach. This study encourages researchers and practitioners to identify dimensions and variables for SCI and analyses how it affects the overall supply chain (SC) performance in terms of efficiency and responsiveness. Although there is extensive research in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>SCI,</b> a comprehensive and integrated approach is missing. This study bridges the gap by developing a framework for measuring SCI, which enables any organisation to identify critical success factors for integrating their SC, measures the degree of integration qualitatively and quantitatively and suggest improvement measures...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the efficacy of human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (hUCB-MCs), genetically modified with the VEGF and GDNF genes using adenoviral vectors, on posttraumatic regeneration after transplantation into the site of spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. Thirty days after SCI, followed by transplantation of nontransduced hUCB-MCs, we observed an improvement in H (latency period, LP) and M(Amax) waves, compared to the group without therapy after SCI. For genetically modified hUCB-MCs, there was improvement in Amax of M wave and LP of both the M and H waves. The ratio between Amax of the H and M waves (Hmax/Mmax) demonstrated that transplantation into the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>SCI</b> of genetically modified hUCB-MCs was more effective than nontransduced hUCB-MCs. Spared tissue and myelinated fibers were increased at day 30 after SCI and transplantation of hUCB-MCs in the lateral and ventral funiculi 2. 5 [*]mm from the lesion epicenter. Transplantation of hUCB-MCs genetically modified with the VEGF and GNDF genes significantly {{increased the number of}} spared myelinated fibers (22 -fold, P> 0. 01) in the main corticospinal tract compared to the nontransduced ones. HNA+ cells with the morphology of phagocytes and microglia-like cells were found as compact clusters or cell bridges within the traumatic cavities that were lined by GFAP+ host astrocytes. Our results show that hUCB-MCs transplanted into the site of SCI improved regeneration and that hUCB-MCs genetically modified with the VEGF and GNDF genes were more effective than nontransduced hUCB-MCs...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{prevalence}} of silent cerebral ischemia (SCI) and cognitive performance in patients with paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and controls in sinus rhythm. BackgroundLarge registries have reported a similar risk for symptomatic stroke in both paroxysmal and persistent AF. The relationship among paroxysmal and persistent AF, SCI, and cognitive impairment has remained uncharted. MethodsTwo hundred seventy subjects were enrolled: 180 patients with AF (50 % paroxysmal and 50 % persistent) and 90  controls. All subjects underwent clinical assessment, neurological examination, cerebral magnetic resonance, and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. ResultsAt least 1 <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>SCI</b> was present in 80 patients (89 %) with paroxysmal AF, 83 (92 %) with persistent AF (paroxysmal vs. persistent, p = 0. 59), and 41 (46 %) controls (paroxysmal vs. controls and persistent vs. controls, p <  0. 01). The number of areas of SCI per subject was higher in patients with persistent AF than in those with paroxysmal AF (41. 1 ± 28. 0 vs. 33. 2 ± 22. 8, p = 0. 04), with controls reporting lower figures (12. 0 ± 26. 7, p <  0. 01 for both). Cognitive performance was significantly worse in patients with persistent and paroxysmal AF than in controls (Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status scores 82. 9 ± 11. 5, 86. 2  ± 13. 8, and 92. 4 ± 15. 4 points, respectively, p < 0. 01).

40|$|Traumatic {{injury to}} the spinal cord (SCI) causes death of neurons, {{disruption}} of motor and sensory nerve fiber (axon) pathways and disruption of communication with the brain. One {{of the goals of}} our research is to promote axon regeneration to restore connectivity across the lesion site. To accomplish this we developed a peripheral nerve (PN) grafting technique where segments of sciatic nerve are either placed directly between the damaged ends of the spinal cord or are used to form a bridge across the lesion. There are several advantages to this approach compared to transplantation of other neural tissues; regenerating axons can be directed towards a specific target area, the number and source of regenerating axons is easily determined by tracing techniques, the graft can be used for electrophysiological experiments to measure functional recovery associated with axons in the graft, and it is possible to use an autologous nerve to reduce the possibility of graft rejection. In our lab we have performed both autologous (donor and recipient are the same animal) and heterologous (donor and recipient are different animals) grafts with comparable results. This approach has been used successfully in both acute and chronic injury situations. Regenerated axons that reach the distal end of the PN graft often fail to extend back into the spinal cord, so we use microinjections of chondroitinase to degrade inhibitory molecules associated with the scar tissue surrounding the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>SCI.</b> At the same time we have found that providing exogenous growth and trophic molecules encourages longer distance axonal regrowth into the spinal cord. Several months after transplantation we perform a variety of anatomical, behavioral and electrophysiological tests to evaluate the recovery of function in our spinal cord injured animals. This experimental approach has been used successfully in several spinal cord injury models, at different levels of injury and in different species (mouse, rat and cat). Importantly, the peripheral nerve grafting approach is effective in promoting regeneration by acute and chronically injured neurons...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} {{analyzes}} literature on management control {{used in the}} dynamic and innovative settings of strategic capital investments (SCI). SCI {{have a significant impact}} on the long term performance of companies. Yet, they are challenging, complex and involve a high degree of uncertainty. Management control is demanding because money and resources cannot be traced to outcomes. SCI needs management control that is future oriented. Yet, Knowledge is lacking when it comes to the specifics of how future oriented management control can be exercised in innovative and dynamic settings. The first purpose of this paper is to review the theoretical and empirical literatures that offer the conceptual tools and the evidence of future oriented management control in companies operating in innovative settings. The second purpose is to prepare a framework to examine management control systems in the innovative context of SCI in the mining industry. This literature review is an attempt to organize current work in a way useful to structure future research questions and findings. The result of the literature review shows that the extant literature is characterized by an orientation towards future oriented management control systems for making SCI decisions. Further the review reveals that some future oriented control systems are more frequently advocated than others in the literature. Previous studies also show that the suitability of different appraisal tools for SCI is debatable. Because the traditional functions of management control systems rely on established measurable outputs, they are suggested to be less effective when considering SCI. The more advocated control systems tend to be more qualitative in nature and based on a long-term point of view. However, previous empirical studies suggest that traditional control systems still dominate in practice. Thus there is a gap between the normative management control literature and the empirical evidence in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>SCI.</b> Based on these findings it is concluded that there is need for more exploratory case studies able to capture intangible factors which address the different roles of management control in SCI, how management control is used and in the way that management control is used.

40|$|We present {{measurements}} of the charge balance function, from the charged particles, for diverse pseudorapidity and transverse momentum ranges in Au + Au collisions at root S(NN) = 200 GeV using the STAR detector at RHIC. We observe that the balance function is boost-invariant within the pseudorapidity coverage vertical bar- 1. 3, 1. 3 vertical bar. The balance function properly scaled by {{the width of the}} observed pseudorapidity window does not depend on the position or size of the pseudorapidity window. This scaling property also holds for particles in different transverse momentum ranges. In addition, we find that the width of the balance function decreases monotonically with increasing transverse momentum for all centrality classes. (c) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{multiplicity}} and pseudorapidity distributions of photons produced in Au + Au and Cu + Cu collisions at root(s) NN = 62. 4 and 200 GeV. The photons are {{measured in the}} region - 3. 7 < eta < - 2. 3 using the photon Multiplicity detector in the STAR experiment at RHIC. The number of photons produced per average number of participating nucleon pairs increases with the beam energy and is independent of (lie collision centrality. For collisions with similar average numbers of participating nucleons the photon multiplicities are observed to be similar for An + Au and Cu + Cu collisions at a given beam energy. The ratios {{of the number of}} charged particles to photons in the measured pseudorapidity range are found to be 1. 4 +/- 0. 1 and 1. 2 +/- 0. 1 for root(s) NN = 62. 4 and 200 GeV, respectively. The energy dependence of this ratio could reflect varying contributions from baryons to charged particles, while mesons are the dominant contributors to photon production in the given kinematic region. The photon pseudorapidity distributions normalized by average number of participating nucleon pairs, when plotted as a function of eta-Y(beam), are found to follow a longitudinal scaling independent of centrality and colliding ion species at both beam energies.
