50|$|Due to {{the legacy}} of Hoxha's dictatorial and violent regime, Albanians in a post {{communist}} environment have rejected Hoxha's version of Albanian nationalism. Instead it has been replaced with a weak form of civic nationalism and regionalism alongside in some instances with a certain anti-nationalism that has inhibited {{the construction of an}} Albanian civil society. Within the context of nationalist discourses during the 1990s the governing <b>Albanian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> regarding European aspirations stressed aspects of Catholicism and as some government members were Muslims made overtures about Islam to join international organisations like the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Post-communist Albanian governments view the tenets of the Albanian National Awakening as being a guiding influence for Albania by placing the nation above sociopolitical and religious differences and steering the country toward Euro-Atlantic integration. Themes and concepts of history from the Zog and later Hoxha era have still continued to be modified and adopted within a post communist environment to fit contemporary Albania's aspirations regarding Europe.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{collapse}} of the isolationist communist regime, Albania's geopolitical orientation between West and East and the role of Christianity and Islam became debated among Albanian intellectuals and its politicians. Within the context of nationalist discourses during the 1990s the governing <b>Albanian</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>party</b> regarding European aspirations stressed aspects of Catholicism and as some government members were Muslims made overtures to Islam to join international organisations like the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). In 1992 Albania became the only entirely European member of the OIC, generating intense controversy within Albania due to concerns that Albania might drift from a secular European future. The Albanian government viewed membership in the OIC as being a bridge between the Muslim-Christian worlds and also as having a [...] "civilising mission" [...] role within the Islamic world due to the Western orientation of Albania. The government of Sali Berisha in the 1990s generated a Muslim network in Albania which was dismantled by the incoming Socialist government in 1997. By 1998-99 Albania's OIC membership was suspended and temporarily withdrawn by prime-minister Fatos Nano who viewed it as inhibiting Albania's European aspirations. In the post communist period different socio-political reactions have occurred by regional neighbours and international powers toward Albania and Muslim Albanians. For example, in the 1990s, Greece preferred and assisted Orthodox Albanian leaders like Fatos Nano in Albania over Muslim Albanian ones like Sali Berisha as they were seen as being friendlier to Greek interests. During the Kosovo crisis (1998-1999), the Albanian political establishment was concerned with Western public opinion viewing Albanians as [...] "Islamic" [...] due to Serbian government claims portraying the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) as interested in creating a Balkan Islamic state.|$|E

50|$|After {{the first}} multi-party {{elections}} in 1990, VMRO-DPMNE became the strongest {{party in the}} Parliament. It did not form a government {{because it did not}} achieve a majority of seats; this forced it to form a coalition with an ethnic Albanian party, but it refused to do so. The party boycotted {{the second round of the}} 1994 elections claiming fraud in the first round. After winning the 1998 election, VMRO-DPMNE surprised many people when finally forming a coalition government with an ethnic <b>Albanian</b> <b>party,</b> the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> of <b>Albanians.</b> After their victory in the elections, they formed a new government with Ljubčo Georgievski as Prime Minister.

Demonstrations were organized in March 1989 and 1990. During this decade many workers were expelled from their jobs and the funds were stopped for educational institutions. That continued for a while, but Albanians were organized and they offered private funds themselves, in that way the education process did not stop.
