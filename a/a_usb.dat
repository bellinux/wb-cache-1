5|$|In {{standard}} USB, {{the electrical}} contacts in <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> connector {{are protected by}} an adjacent plastic tongue, and the entire connecting assembly is usually protected by an enclosing metal sheath.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers of {{personal}} electronic devices might not include <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> standard connector on their product for technical or marketing reasons. Some manufacturers provide proprietary cables that permit their devices to physically connect to <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> standard port. Full functionality of proprietary ports and cables with USB standard ports is not assured; for example, some devices only use the USB connection for battery charging {{and do not}} implement any data transfer functions.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>USB</b> network {{relies on}} a single host {{at the top of}} the tree to control the network. All {{communications}} are between the host and one peripheral. In a FireWire network, any capable node can control the network.|$|E
5000|$|KEYSWEEPER: a Keylogger {{in form of}} <b>an</b> <b>USB</b> wall charger, that {{wirelessly}} and passively sniffs, decrypts, {{logs and}} reports back (over GSM).|$|R
5000|$|The {{controller}} itself uses <b>a</b> proprietary <b>USB</b> interface, {{and through}} user modification and third party [...] drivers, {{can be used}} as <b>a</b> standard <b>USB</b> controller.|$|R

5|$|Only {{moderate}} {{force is}} needed to insert or remove <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> cable. USB cables and small USB devices are {{held in place by}} the gripping force from the receptacle (without need of the screws, clips, or thumb-turns other connectors have required).|$|E
5|$|Synchronization Pattern: <b>A</b> <b>USB</b> packet {{begins with}} an 8-bit {{synchronization}} sequence, 00000001₂. That is, after the initial idle state J, the data lines toggle KJKJKJKK. The final 1bit (repeated Kstate) {{marks the end of}} the sync pattern {{and the beginning of the}} USB frame. For high-bandwidth USB, the packet begins with a 32-bit synchronization sequence.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{hardware}} requirements to install Windows 10 {{are the same}} as for Windows 8.1 and Windows 8, and only slightly higher than Windows 7. The 64-bit versions require a CPU that supports certain instructions. Devices with low storage capacity must provide <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> flash drive or SD card with sufficient storage for temporary files during upgrades.|$|E
50|$|The base package comes an Intel Core i3 4010U, 4 {{gigabytes}} of RAM and 128 gigabytes {{solid state}} drive with configurations up to an Intel Core i7 4500U, 8 gigabytes of RAM and 512 gigabyte {{solid state drive}}. The 13.3-inch screen uses in-plane switching (IPS) technology, has a high resolution QHD+ (3,200 × 1,800) 10 point multitouch display, and a brightness of 350 nits. The Yoga 2 Pro come with Intel Wireless Display technology in order {{to conform to the}} Ultrabook specification. The ports it comes with are <b>an</b> <b>USB</b> 3.0, <b>an</b> <b>USB</b> 2.0, <b>a</b> micro-HDMI, a 2-in-1 card reader, and a combo jack. Lenovo claims a battery life of up to nine hours.|$|R
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>USB</b> {{has become}} faster, devices have also become hungrier for data {{and so there}} is now demand for sending large amounts of data - either to be stored on the device, or be relayed over {{wireless}} links (see 3GPP Long Term Evolution).|$|R
50|$|The jYUice is a {{power bank}} from YU Televentures, and has a {{capacity}} of 5000mAh or 10000mAh. The power bank consists of an anodized aluminum shell which houses a lithium-polymer battery. The 5000mAh model has <b>a</b> single 5V/2.1A <b>USB</b> port while the 10000mAh model has <b>a</b> 5V/1A <b>USB</b> port and <b>a</b> 5V/2.4A <b>USB</b> port. It comes with a multi-colored LED light to indicate how much charge the jYUice has.|$|R
5|$|The type-A plug has an {{elongated}} rectangular cross-section, inserts into a type-A receptacle on a downstream port on <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> host or hub, and carries both power and data. Captive cables on USB devices, such as keyboards or mice, will be terminated with a type-A plug.|$|E
5|$|There are cables with A plugs on both ends, {{which may}} be valid if the cable includes, for example, <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> host-to-host {{transfer}} device with 2 ports, but they could also be non-standard and erroneous and should be used carefully.|$|E
5|$|Type D: This Micro {{connector}} shrinks the connector size {{to something}} resembling a micro-USB connector, measuring only 6.4mm × 2.8mm For comparison, a micro-USB connector is 6.85mm × 1.8mm and <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> Type-A connector is 11.5mm × 4.5mm. It keeps the standard 19 pins of types A and C, but the pin assignment {{is different from}} both.|$|E
50|$|Per {{the first}} edition of the JVS, {{published}} in 1996, peripheral devices connect to a dedicated I/O board. The main board connects to the I/O board via <b>an</b> <b>USB</b> Type-A to USB Type-B interface cable, and peripherals connect to the I/O board via USB-A.|$|R
50|$|BioSlimDisk is <b>a</b> {{biometric}} <b>USB</b> storage device.|$|R
50|$|Brazilian {{proposal}} for the interactivity channel is focused on flexibility {{and is based on}} TCP/IP protocol. Receiver shall have <b>an</b> <b>USB</b> interface for <b>an</b> external Modem connection. This is adequate to comply with an existing telecomm infrastructure of multiple technologies and is also open for future innovations.|$|R
5|$|USB {{mice and}} {{keyboards}} {{can usually be}} used with older computers that have PS/2 connectors {{with the aid of}} a small USB-to-PS/2 adapter. For mice and keyboards with dual-protocol support, an adaptor that contains no logic circuitry may be used: the hardware in the USB keyboard or mouse is designed to detect whether it is connected to <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> or PS/2 port, and communicate using the appropriate protocol. Converters also exist that connect PS/2 keyboards and mice (usually one of each) to <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> port. These devices present two HID endpoints to the system and use a microcontroller to perform bidirectional data translation between the two standards.|$|E
5|$|When <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> {{device is}} first {{connected}} to <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> host, the USB device enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts {{by sending a}} reset signal to the USB device. The data rate of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB device's information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the device {{is supported by the}} host, the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.|$|E
5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE. This is required as <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> hub functions as a very simple repeater, broadcasting the host message to all connected devices regardless if the packet was for it or not. This means in a mixed speed environment, {{there is a potential}} danger that a low speed will misinterpret a high or full speed signal from the host.|$|E
50|$|Electronically the UltraPort {{connector}} {{is identical}} to the standard USB port. UltraPort uses a proprietary mechanical connection, so UltraPort devices cannot be plugged into <b>a</b> normal <b>USB</b> interface. However the UltraPort devices shipped with an adapter which allowed them to be attached to <b>a</b> regular <b>USB</b> port.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, many {{devices have}} USB On-The-Go and support USB storage, {{in most cases}} using either <b>a</b> special <b>USB</b> micro-B flash drive or an adapter for <b>a</b> {{standard}} <b>USB</b> port. Such adapters {{can also be used}} with various other USB devices, such as hardware mice and keyboards.|$|R
50|$|On {{the back}} side there in audio outport port, {{microphone}} input port, <b>a</b> micro <b>USB</b> port {{and support for the}} Thinkpad 20V power adapter. On it size it has <b>a</b> full size <b>USB</b> port.|$|R
5|$|Game Capture HD, which {{connects to}} gaming {{consoles}} to record gameplay, {{was introduced in}} 2012. It was created in response to gamers that were hacking EyeTV products for gameplay recording. The device connects between a gaming console and the TV and is powered by <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> connection. It captures video as the console sends it to the television, compresses and stores it. A review in iPhone Life gave it 4 out of 5 stars and noted that {{it could also be}} used to record iPad games with the right setup.|$|E
5|$|Symantec {{distributed}} the product as a download, a boxed Compact Disc (CD) copy, and as OEM software. Some retailers also distributed it on <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> flash drive. Norton Internet Security held a 61% {{market share in}} the United States retail security suite category {{in the first half}} of 2007. In this study, competitors, in terms of market share, included security suites from CA, Inc., Trend Micro, and Kaspersky Lab.|$|E
5|$|Symantec has {{released}} {{a special edition}} of Norton Internet Security optimized for netbooks. This is available as download from the Symantec website or in <b>a</b> <b>USB</b> thumb drive. Symantec states that the Netbook edition is optimized for netbooks. The main display is optimized to provide support for the 800 x 480 screen resolution. In addition, non-critical tasks are delayed while the netbook is on battery. Furthermore, the Netbook edition contains complimentary access to Norton's secure online backup and parental control to protect children as they surf the web.|$|E
50|$|Create <b>a</b> {{bootable}} <b>USB</b> flash or {{hard drive}} from a bootable disc image (works only with DOS, Windows NT and syslinux boot sectors). For this, the user can open an ISO image with UltraISO and choose 'Bootable' and 'Write disk image' to burn onto <b>a</b> bootable <b>USB</b> disk.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to make <b>an</b> <b>USB</b> drive or <b>an</b> optical medium bootable in order to start HDClone from it, independently of Windows. This also allows it to copy operating systems, on which the HDClone executable file can't be started. It uses either Miray Symobi or Linux as host operating system.|$|R
