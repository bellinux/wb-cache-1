5|$|A {{wide range}} of birds were eaten, {{including}} swans, peafowl, quail, partridge, storks, cranes, larks, linnets and other songbirds that could be trapped in nets, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> any other wild bird that could be hunted. Swans and peafowl were domesticated to some extent, but were only eaten by the social elite, and more praised for their fine appearance as stunning entertainment dishes, entremets, than for their meat. As today, geese and ducks had been domesticated but were not as popular as the chicken, the fowl equivalent of the pig. Curiously enough the barnacle goose was believed to reproduce not by laying eggs like other birds, but by growing in barnacles, and was hence considered acceptable food for fast and Lent. But at the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), Pope Innocent III explicitly prohibited the eating of barnacle geese during Lent, arguing that they lived and fed like ducks and so were of the same nature as other birds.|$|E
5|$|Kanye West {{began working}} on Graduation {{immediately}} after releasing his second studio album Late Registration. By late September 2005, West had already completed three songs for the album, which he intended to contain a total of twelve tracks. Around {{the time of the}} recording of the third studio album, West would often listen to songs written by folk and country singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his word play and storytelling abilities. The former musician had been recommended to West by multiple of his friends, including English disc jockey Samantha Ronson, all of whom claimed his music and the way he dealt with the press reminded them of Dylan. Kanye also listened to his most favorite alternative rock bands, including The Killers, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, and Keane, in order to gain new ideas on how to make his hip-hop production style more stadium-friendly. Additionally, West would often test his new songs on his iPod, in his office, in dance clubs <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> anywhere people might listen to his music. He would then make adjustments to the tracks based on feedback he received, repeating the process as many times as necessary.|$|E

The countryside is broken and interspersed with marsh, salt pans, streams, paddy fields, coconut and palm groves. The river Daman Ganga splits the capital city of Daman into halves—Nani Daman (Damão Pequeno) and Moti Daman (Damão Grande). The strategically important features were Daman Fort and the Air Control Tower of Daman Airport.|$|E

500|$|An almost {{immediate}} {{influence can be}} seen in the two portraits by Mazo {{of subjects}} depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink. [...] Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas.|$|E
500|$|The Hills was {{moderately}} {{well received}} among critics. The series' first season holds {{a score of}} 52 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews", based on eight reviews. Robert Abele of LA Weekly complimented the program for being [...] "insanely watchable", while Varietys Brian Lowry criticized the storylines as being [...] "as old as they come". The second season garnered more favorable feedback, with Virginia Heffnernan of The New York Times opining that Conrad [...] "now registers as charm". After the falling-out between Conrad and Montag in the third season, Heffernan also commented that The Hills [...] "is more convincing than Friends <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> any other comedy about female relationships because — {{as anyone who has}} ever been a young woman knows — undying friendships die".|$|E

[...] Furthemore, Conrad's delivery of the titular line [...] "You know what you did!" [...] when speaking to Montag has been recognized as an iconic moment from the series; the staff from Us Weekly ranked the scene as the most memorable event from the program when recapping highlights from its six seasons in July 2010.|$|E
500|$|Just as the {{aircraft}} hit takeoff speed, the No.1 Engine and its pylon assembly {{separated from the}} left wing, ripping away a [...] section of the leading edge with it. The combined unit flipped {{over the top of}} the wing and landed on the runway. Robert Graham, supervisor of maintenance for American Airlines, stated: [...] "As {{the aircraft}} got closer, I noticed what appeared to be vapor or smoke of some type coming from the leading edge of the wing and the No. 1 engine pylon. I noticed that the No. 1 engine was bouncing up and down quite a bit <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> the time the aircraft got opposite my position and started rotation, the engine came off, went up {{over the top of the}} wing, and rolled back down onto the runway... Before going over the wing, the engine went forward and up just as if it had lift and was actually climbing. It didn't strike the top of the wing on its way, rather it followed the clear path of the airflow of the wing, up and over the top of it, then down below the tail. The aircraft continued a fairly normal climb until it started a turn to the left. And at that point, I thought he was going to come back to the airport." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{series has}} {{received}} positive reviews from critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

He complimented the characters' stylized appearance, the stories' relative complexity for children's television, and the solid jokes which make the show enjoyable for parents as well as children. He gave the series a B+. The show has been critically praised for its humor and moral outlook by Brian Truitt of USA Today. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club later commented that Friendship Is Magic {{is an example of}} a show that, while considered [...] "girly", has been able to tap into the nerd culture to allow it to gain wider acceptance than other comparable forms. Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media, an organization focusing on the parenting aspect of children's media, gave the show a rating of four out of five stars, emphasizing its messages of friendship, tolerance and respect, but advised parents to be wary of the [...] "influence the characters might have on their kids' desires, since it's rooted in a well-known product line of books, toys, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> everything in between." [...] Liz Ohanesian, for L.A. Weekly, said that the show is [...] "absolutely genuine in its messages about friendship but never takes itself too seriously". Matt Morgan, writing for Wireds [...] "GeekDad" [...] column, praised the show for having [...] "rebooted the long-time Hasbro property while managing to lace it with geeky undertones" [...] and being one of the few [...] "girl-focused shows that a geeky dad can appreciate with his daughter". Los Angeles Times critic Robert Lloyd called the show [...] "smarter and sassier and more aesthetically sophisticated" [...] than any of the previous My Little Pony cartoons, and praised its ability to appeal to both children and their parents, in that it is [...] "smart and sprightly and well-staged, and never horribly cute". TV Guide listed Friendship Is Magic as one of the top sixty animated shows of all time in a September 2013 list.|$|E

[...] There are two etymologies for the name. Some sources state that “Mazunte” is derived from a Nahuatl phrase, “maxotetia” [...] which means “please deposit eggs here.” [...] However, older residents of the community state that it is from the word “mizontle,” used by locals to refer to a crab species that used to be very abundant in the area.|$|E

[...] The cold and austere conditions at Twickenham, along with nearly constant filming and sessions starting much earlier than the Beatles' preferred schedule, constrained creativity and exacerbated tensions within the group.
