5|$|By 1944, Belgian collaborationist groups {{began to}} feel {{increasingly}} abandoned by the German government as the situation deteriorated. As resistance attacks against them escalated, collaborationist parties became more violent and launched reprisals <b>against</b> <b>civilians,</b> including the Courcelles Massacre in August 1944.|$|E
5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Belgium in World War I, many Belgian workers {{had refused to}} work for the German administration as a form of passive resistance. This had led to large-scale reprisals <b>against</b> <b>civilians</b> as the occupiers had attempted to enforce their policies by armed force.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} Croat civilians in {{hospitals}} and shelters marked with a red cross were targeted by Serb forces. There were numerous well-documented war crimes <b>against</b> <b>civilians</b> and prisoners of war perpetrated by Serb and Yugoslav forces in Croatia: the Dalj killings, the Lovas massacre, the Široka Kula massacre, the Baćin massacre, the Saborsko massacre, the Škabrnja massacre, the Voćin massacre, and the Zagreb rocket attacks.|$|E
5|$|Axis forces {{employed}} {{biological and}} chemical weapons. The Imperial Japanese Army {{used a variety of}} such weapons during its invasion and occupation of China (see Unit 731) and in early conflicts against the Soviets. Both the Germans and Japanese tested such weapons <b>against</b> <b>civilians</b> and, sometimes on prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Because of Lebanon's weak central government, the PLO {{was able}} to operate {{virtually}} as an independent state. During {{this time in the}} 1970s, numerous leftist PLO groups took up arms against Israel, carrying out attacks <b>against</b> <b>civilians</b> as well as military targets within Israel and outside of it.|$|E

5|$|Croatian {{forces were}} {{hampered}} by an inadequate command structure, poor coordination and lack heavy weapons. The battle {{resulted in more}} than 200 combat deaths, and established lines of control which would remain unchanged until 1994, when the plateau was recaptured by the HVO. In 2012, Republika Srpska authorities charged seven Croats with war crimes committed at the plateau <b>against</b> <b>civilians</b> and prisoners of war. The next year, Croatian authorities charged 21 former JNA members with war crimes against HVO prisoners captured at the Kupres Plateau.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Osijek, Croatian authorities charged thirteen JNA officers with war crimes <b>against</b> <b>civilians,</b> but no arrests have been made to date. Croatian authorities also charged the wartime commander of Osijek's defence, Branimir Glavaš, and five others with war crimes committed in the city in 1991. The five were convicted and received sentences ranging between eight and ten years, and as of March 2015, judicial proceedings against Glavaš are in progress.|$|E
5|$|Soviet air assaults <b>against</b> <b>civilians</b> in Estonian towns {{were a part}} of the offensive, {{aimed at}} forcing the Estonians away from {{supporting}} the German side. The Soviet Long Range Aviation branch assaulted the Estonian capital of Tallinn on the night of 8–9 March. Approximately 40% of the housing was destroyed in the city; 25,000 people were left homeless and 500 civilians were killed. The result of the air raid was the opposite of what the Soviets intended, as people felt disgusted by the Soviet atrocities; more men answered the German conscription call.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war, {{the militias}} of collaborationist {{political}} parties also began to participate actively in reprisals for attacks or assassinations by the resistance. These included both reprisal assassinations of leading figures suspected of resistance involvement or sympathy (including Alexandre Galopin, head of the Société Générale, who was assassinated in February 1944) or retaliatory massacres <b>against</b> <b>civilians.</b> Foremost among these was the Courcelles Massacre, a reprisal by Rexist paramilitaries for the assassination of a Burgomaster, in which 20 civilians were killed. A similar massacre also took place at Meensel-Kiezegem, where 67 were killed.|$|E
5|$|During the Japanese {{occupation}} of Hong Kong, the Japanese army committed atrocities <b>against</b> <b>civilians</b> and POWs, {{such as the}} St. Stephen's College massacre. Local residents also suffered widespread food shortages, limited rationing and hyper-inflation arising from the forced exchange of currency from Hong Kong dollars to Japanese military banknotes. The initial ratio of 2:1 was gradually devalued to 4:1 and ownership of Hong Kong dollars was declared illegal and punishable by harsh torture. Due to starvation and forced deportation for slave labour to mainland China, the population of Hong Kong had dwindled from 1.6 million in 1941 to 600,000 in 1945, when the United Kingdom resumed control of the colony on 2 September 1945.|$|E
5|$|The rolling-back of the {{progressive}} policies of the civilian governments resulted {{in a series of}} leftist insurgencies in the countryside, beginning in 1960. This triggered the 36-year Guatemalan Civil War between the U.S.-backed military government of Guatemala and the leftist insurgents, who frequently had a large degree of popular support. The largest of these movements was led by the Guerrilla Army of the Poor, which at its largest point had 270,000 members. During the civil war, atrocities <b>against</b> <b>civilians</b> were committed by both sides; 93% of these violations were committed by the U.S.-backed military, which included a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous Maya population in the 1980s. The violence was particularly severe during the presidencies of Ríos Montt and Lucas García.|$|E

5|$|Ethnic {{cleansing}} in Bosnia and Herzegovina {{happened on}} a larger scale than in the RSK, and all the major ethnic groups became victims of ethnically motivated violence. The conflict produced a vast number of displaced persons. It is estimated that there were over a million refugees in areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina outside VRS control at the end of 1994, while the area's total population was about 2.2 million. About 720,000 Bosniaks, 460,000 Serbs and 150,000 Croats fled the country. Croatia hosted {{a large proportion of the}} Bosniak and Croat refugees; by November 1992 there were around 333,000 registered, and an estimated 100,000 unregistered, refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina in Croatia. The refugees left their homes under varied circumstances. The ethnic violence committed by Bosnian Serbs <b>against</b> <b>civilians</b> resulted in the greatest number of civilian victims in the Bosnian war, culminating in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} Arévalo's {{presidency}} in 1951, Jacobo Árbenz {{was elected to the}} {{presidency in}} a landslide. The progressive military leader of 1944 continued Arévalo's reforms, and began an ambitious land-reform program, known as Decree 900. Under it, the uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation, and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree. The majority of them were indigenous people, whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion. Árbenz' policies ran afoul of the United Fruit Company, which lost some of its uncultivated land. The company lobbied the US government for Árbenz' overthrow, and the State Department responded by engineering a coup under the pretext that Árbenz was a communist. Carlos Castillo Armas took power {{at the head of a}} military junta, provoking the Guatemalan Civil War. The war lasted from 1960 to 1996, and saw the US-backed military commit genocide against the indigenous Maya peoples, and widespread human rights violations <b>against</b> <b>civilians.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 1937 {{war broke}} out in {{northern}} China between China and Japan, and by August the fighting had spread {{to the city of}} Shanghai. After capturing Shanghai the Japanese Army decided on December 1 to continue its military campaign to the capital city of the Nationalist government of China, Nanking, which is roughly 300 kilometers west of Shanghai. Although the Japanese succeeded in surrounding Nanking and defeating the Chinese garrison stationed there by December 13, few of the Chinese soldiers within the city formally surrendered. Instead they threw away their uniforms and weapons and hid among the city's civilian population. Over the course of its subsequent occupation of Nanking the Japanese Army hunted down the former Chinese soldiers within the city and in a large number of cases summarily executed them. At the same time soldiers of the Japanese Army also committed random acts of murder <b>against</b> <b>civilians,</b> and engaged in rape, arson, and looting. These events are collectively known as the Nanking Massacre.|$|E

5|$|Meyszner's time in Belgrade was characterised by {{friction}} and competition with German military, economic and foreign affairs officials, {{and by his}} visceral hatred and distrust of Serbs. During his tenure, he oversaw regular reprisal killings and sent {{tens of thousands of}} forced labourers to the Reich and occupied Norway. His Gestapo detachment used a gas van to kill as many as 8,000 Jewish women and children that had been detained at the Sajmište concentration camp. In April 1944, his outspoken complaints about a reduction in reprisals <b>against</b> <b>civilians</b> allowed his enemies within the German occupation regime in Serbia to have him removed. Himmler transferred him to Berlin with the task of establishing a Europe-wide gendarmerie. After the war, he fell {{into the hands of the}} Allies and was interrogated by the United States Chief Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis Criminality. Extradited to Yugoslavia, he was tried for war crimes, along with many of his staff from his time in Serbia. He was found guilty by a Yugoslav military court and executed by hanging in January 1947.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuing}} {{military confrontation}} {{in the region}} was accompanied by an escalation of ethnic violence, culminating in war crimes <b>against</b> <b>civilians</b> committed by military authorities in Gospić and the SAO Krajina military {{in the area around}} Lički Osik in October 1991. In Gospić, approximately 100 Serb civilians were taken from the town and killed in the surrounding fields. Some of the responsibles for the event, later known as the Gospić massacre, were prosecuted by the Croatian judiciary. This resulted in the conviction, in 2003, of Norac and two other defendants to 12 years in prison. The killings in the Lički Osik area, known as the Široka Kula massacre, resulted in the deaths of 40 civilians, mostly Croats but also some Serbs suspected of supporting Croatia. In 2011, a court in Belgrade, Serbia, convicted four former SAO Krajina militiamen of killing four Serbs and a Croat in Široka Kula.|$|E
5|$|XXIBomber Command also {{conducted}} an intensive propaganda campaign alongside its firebombing raids. It {{has been estimated}} that B-29s dropped 10 million propaganda leaflets in May, 20 million in June and 30 million in July. The Japanese government implemented harsh penalties <b>against</b> <b>civilians</b> who kept copies of these leaflets. On the night of 27/28July, six B-29s dropped leaflets over 11 Japanese cities warning that they would be attacked in the future; this was intended to lower the morale of Japanese civilians and convince them that the United States was seeking to minimize civilian casualties. Six of these cities (Aomori, Ichinomiya, Tsu, Uji-Yamada Ōgaki and Uwajima) were attacked on 28July. No B-29s were lost in the raids on these cities, though six were damaged by attacks from between 40 and 50 fighters and another five were hit by anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
