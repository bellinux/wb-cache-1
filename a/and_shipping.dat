5|$|Among {{those who}} contributed to Aalborg's {{prosperity}} in the 19th century were Poul Pagh who significantly developed trade <b>and</b> <b>shipping,</b> and Christen Winther Obel who increased production at the C.W.

Another important figure of the times was Marie Rée who ran the local newspaper Aalborg Stiftstidende until 1900, often promoting women's rights.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, the Gulf Oil Corporation {{identified}} Whiddy Island in Bantry Bay, Ireland, {{as being}} the most suitable site for the new terminal.

5|$|Spokane {{became an}} {{important}} rail <b>and</b> <b>shipping</b> center because of its location between mining and farming areas. In the early 1880s, gold and silver were discovered in the Inland Empire; as a regional shipping center, the city furnished supplies to the miners who passed through {{on their way to}} the mineral-rich Coeur d'Alene, Colville and Kootenay districts. The mining districts are still considered among the most productive in North America.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{disturbances}} in the landing process of carrier-based aircraft include deck movement <b>and</b> <b>ship</b> wake. To guarantee {{the security of}} landing process, the simulation and model are necessary for the disturbances, and the deck movement <b>and</b> <b>ship</b> wake should be analyzed as well. On the basis of analysis of disturbances, the disturbances can be catalogued into two types: deck movement <b>and</b> <b>ship</b> wake. Combining with the relevant instructions in the American Army Standard, the mathematical model of each disturbance is established. The simulations of the deck movement <b>and</b> <b>ship</b> wake are also shown in this paper, which can supply the reliable disturbances models {{for the design of}} the control system of carrier-aircraft landing process...|$|R
5|$|The Sunderland Echo is {{an evening}} {{newspaper}} serving the Sunderland, South Tyneside and East Durham areas of North East England. The newspaper {{was founded by}} Samuel Storey, Edward Backhouse, Edward Temperley Gourley, Charles Palmer, Richard Ruddock, Thomas Glaholm and Thomas Scott Turnbull in 1873, as the Sunderland Daily Echo <b>and</b> <b>Shipping</b> Gazette. Designed to provide a platform for the Radical views held by Storey and his partners, it was also Sunderland's first local daily paper.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} of the Sunderland Daily Echo <b>and</b> <b>Shipping</b> Gazette was printed on 22 December 1873, on a flat-bed press in Press Lane, Sunderland. Five hundred copies of the four-page issue were {{produced}} at noon and 4pm, and sold for a halfpenny each.|$|E
5|$|The post-war years saw the Echo drop Shipping Gazette {{from its}} main title-piece, {{following}} a redesign in 1959. Instead, the paper {{became known as}} Echo Sunderland for several years, although the name Sunderland Echo <b>and</b> <b>Shipping</b> Gazette continued to be printed in much smaller type above the new title. A further title-piece redesign in 1972, however, dispensed with the words Shipping Gazette and introduced an illustration of Wearmouth Bridge alongside the title Echo Sunderland.|$|E

The fleet then sailed north and attacked Formosa again on the 15th of the month. Further raids were conducted against Hong Kong, Canton and Hainan the next day. The Third Fleet departed the South China Sea on 20 January and, after making further attacks on Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands, returned to its base on 25 January.|$|E
5|$|Ash may disrupt {{transportation}} systems over large areas for hours to days, including roads and vehicles, railways and ports <b>and</b> <b>shipping.</b> Falling ash {{will reduce the}} visibility which can make driving difficult and dangerous. In addition, fast travelling cars will stir up ash, creating billowing clouds which perpetuate ongoing visibility hazards. Ash accumulations will decrease traction, especially when wet, and cover road markings. Fine-grained ash can infiltrate openings in cars and abrade most surfaces, especially between moving parts. Air and oil filters will become blocked requiring frequent replacement. Rail transport is less vulnerable, with disruptions mainly caused by reduction in visibility.|$|E
5|$|Before a {{decision}} was made to establish a harbour (now the second largest in Denmark) at Esbjerg in 1868, the area consisted of only a few farms. Esbjerg developed quickly with the population rising to 13,000 by 1901 and 70,000 by 1970. In addition to its fishing <b>and</b> <b>shipping</b> activities, it also became an important centre for agricultural exports. Over the years, many of the city's visitors have arrived by ferry from Harwich, Essex, England, but this service closed in September 2014 having run since 1875. The harbour facilities are being expanded to answer the needs of the wind-turbine industry and container shipping traffic. Esbjerg is served by Esbjerg Airport with flights to Aberdeen, Scotland and Stavanger, Norway.|$|E

5|$|Bottling <b>and</b> <b>shipping</b> of the Malvern water grew in volume. In 1842, Dr. James Wilson and Dr. James Manby Gully, leading exponents of hydrotherapy, set up {{clinics in}} Malvern (Holyrood House {{for women and}} Tudor House for men). Malvern {{expanded}} rapidly as a residential spa. Several large hotels {{and many of the}} large villas in Malvern date from its heyday. Many smaller hotels and guest houses were built between about 1842 and 1875. By 1855 there were already 95hotels and boarding houses and by 1865 over a quarter of the town's 800houses were boarding and lodging houses. Most were in Great Malvern, the town centre, while others were in the surrounding settlements of Malvern Wells, Malvern Link, North Malvern and West Malvern.|$|E

5|$|Congestion pricing or {{congestion}} charges is {{a system}} of surcharging users of public goods that are subject to congestion through excess demand such as higher peak charges for use of bus services, electricity, metros, railways, telephones, and road pricing to reduce traffic congestion; airlines <b>and</b> <b>shipping</b> companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times. This pricing strategy regulates demand, {{making it possible to}} manage congestion without increasing supply. Market economics theory, which encompasses the congestion pricing concept, postulates that users will be forced to pay for the negative externalities they create, making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand, and more aware of their impact on the environment.|$|E
