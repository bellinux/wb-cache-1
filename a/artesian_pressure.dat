5000|$|Hydraulic (open-system) pingos {{result from}} {{groundwater}} flowing from an outside source, i.e. subpermafrost or intrapermafrost aquifers. Hydrostatic pressure initializes {{the formation of}} the ice core as water is pushed up and subsequently freezes. Open-system pingos have no limitations to the amount of water available unless the aquifers freeze. They often occur at the base of slopes and are commonly known as Greenland type. The groundwater is put under <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> and forces the ground up as it makes an expanding ice core. It is not the <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> itself that forces the ground up, but rather the ice core that is being fed the water from the aquifer. These are often formed in a thin, discontinuous permafrost. These conditions allow an ice core to form, but also provide it with a supply of artesian ground water. If water pressure entering an artesian pingo is strong enough, it can lift the pingo up allowing a sub-pingo water lens to form underneath. However, if the water lens starts to leak water it can cause subsidence which can compromise the structure. [...] These pingos are often oval or oblong shaped. It is still not entirely understood why open system or hydraulic pingos normally occur in unglaciated terrain.|$|E

40|$|Geothermal energy {{production}} can {{be limited by}} insufficient working fluid and pressure depletion, whereas geologic CO 2 storage (GCS) can be limited by overpressure, which may drive CO 2 leakage and cause induced seismicity. Integration of these complementary systems can realize synergy, enhancing the viability of each system.

A well pattern consisting of a minimum of four concentric rings of horizontal producers and injectors is proposed to conserve pressure from the injection process, minimize loss of CO 2, control the lateral extent of overpressure, and segregate the CO 2 and brine production zones.

Mean annual air temperatures over the monitored period were slightly below 08 C, but mean annual ground surface temperatures were around 28 C warmer, {{due to the}} insulating effects of snow cover. Seasonal frost penetration was highly dependent on snow thickness, and at the monitoring location varied from 30 – 38 cm over the four years. The shallow annual frost penetration suggests that the site may {{be close to the}} limit of active solifluction in this area. Surface solifluction rates over the period 2002 – 06 ranged from 0. 5 cm yr 1 {{at the rear of the}} lobe tread to 1. 6 cm yr 1 just behind the lobe front, with corresponding soil transport rates of 6 cm 3 cm 1 yr 1 and 46 cm 3 cm 1 yr 1.

Soil thawing was associated with surface settlement and downslope soil displacements, but following clearance of the frozen ground, later soil surface settlement was accompanied by retrograde movement.

Sampling of groundwater and colloids is often conducted in vertical or near vertical boreholes or wells drilled from the ground surface. However, the <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> in groundwater may decrease to atmospheric pressure, and the in situ oxidation-reduction condition of the groundwater may change during sampling. Furthermore, the subsurface environment may become contaminated by drilling fluid, artifacts such as steel drill bits and rods containing Fe, and meteoric water during drilling (Dideriksen et al. [2007]). Changes in the chemical composition and physicochemical condition of groundwater may induce the formation of anthropogenic colloids and secondary minerals, especially Fe(III)-(oxy)hydroxides. The chemical composition of groundwater may be affected by co-precipitation and sorption of elements onto newly formed colloids and secondary minerals.|$|E
40|$|The Jurassic Navajo Sandstone on the Colorado Plateau of Utah may be {{considered}} for sequestration of CO 2, because it is thick, widely distributed, has a high porosity and permeability, is typically horizontal to gently folded, is favorably located with respect to seal strata, and underlies many large point sources of CO 2. However, faulting common on the Colorado Plateau may provide pathways for leakage of the CO 2 similar to present-day geysers and CO 2 -charged springs. Natural groundwater present in the Navajo Sandstone includes a range of low-salinity, moderate-salinity with high bicarbonate, and high-salinity waters. Higher salinity waters may have moved from deeper strata under <b>artesian</b> <b>pressures</b> or originated from solution of evaporite in pre-Jurassic rocks. These characteristics make the Navajo Sandstone an excellent analog for examining the geochemistry of CO 2 injection into deep saline aquifers. The storativity of CO 2 in solution {{is a function of}} the solubility of CO 2 in these waters, which is dependent on salinity, temperature, and pressure. Geochemical modeling shows that the coolest, least saline water can contain the most CO 2 in solution. Dissolving CO 2 in the water lowers the pH, so that no minerals precipitate, and the Navajo Sandstone contains only small amounts of mineral that may consume the H+. The reaction of the acidic water produced by dissolving CO 2 with K-feldspar and minor clays and calcite in the sandstone throughout 500 yr consumes little H+ and produces only small amounts of product minerals. The Navajo Sandstone likely would not store significant CO 2 as mineral precipitate, and thus, stored volumes of CO 2 would be limited by its solubility in the in-situ water and storage as free CO 2 in pore space...|$|R
40|$|Landslides in Pleistocene sediments {{along the}} Thompson River, south of Ashcroft, British Columbia {{have been known}} since before the Canadian Pacific (CP) railway was built through the valley in the 1880 s. The Canadian National (CN) {{mainline}} railway, built {{in the early twentieth}} century, also follows the valley. Since the CP mainline was open to traffic in 1886, landslides have occurred along both sides of the Thompson valley and have resulted in derailments and traffic disruption along this strategic railway corridor. Past work identified a critical interbedded glaciolacustrine silt and clay unit {{at the base of the}} valley fill in which the sliding planes of the landslides were located. In our geotechnical characterization of this unit we identify the clay as the main contributing factor towards the instability of slopes in the Thompson River Valley due to its low residual strength parameters. Ring shear testing of this unit indicate residual friction angles between 10 o and 15 o. The use of residual shear strength parameters is necessitated by the presence of pre-sheared surfaces in the valley fill material caused by historical landsliding and glacial overriding. An additional contributing factor to slope instability in Thompson River Valley is the presence of <b>artesian</b> pore water <b>pressures</b> located below the failure surfaces of landslides in the valley. Previously suggested explanations for development of the elevated pore pressures include dynamic change in the Thompson River stage, and over irrigation of upslope farm lands. Groundwater models of Thompson River Valley were constructed using the advanced modeling tool HydroGeoSphere in order to determine the origin of these elevated pressures, and to explore additional influences on the regional groundwater flow system, including irrigation and river stage. Analysis of groundwater simulations showed that due to its low permeability, the glaciolacustrine silt and clay unit is important in controlling groundwater flow patterns, and explains the development of <b>artesian</b> <b>pressures</b> in the valley bottom. Further, it was shown that fluctuation in river stage and additional infiltration due to irrigation of upslope farm lands had minimal impact on pore water pressures, and cannot explain the development of landslides in the study area. Groundwater simulations were coupled with slope stability analyses in order to assess the slope Factor of Safety associated with certain groundwater conditions. This was achieved by using SLOPE/W and SEEP/W. Slopes were found to be unstable under natural conditions with a Factor of Safety close to unity. Significant changes to the Factor of Safety were noted for scenarios where precipitation was doubled and halved, but irrigation was again shown to have a minimal effect on the stability of Thompson Valley slopes...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of a multiple retrogressive landslide {{at the site of}} the Petrofka Bridge provided a unique opportunity to identify the failure mechanism and evaluate the present stability of the landslide. Although aggrading of the North Saskatchewan River following deglaciation has resulted in stabilization of certain landslide styles while altering the mechanism of failure in others, the present stability of this landslide was supported by over twenty years of satisfactory performance of the Petrofka Bridge. The landslide at the Petrofka Bridge is approximately 900 metres long, 60 metres high and up to 110 metres thick. The shear zone is in a montmorillonitic clay shale of the Tertiary-Quarternary sediments. The pore-water pressures at the shear zone were controlled by pore-water pressure conditions within the artesian sandstone of the Judith River Formation. The <b>artesian</b> pore-water <b>pressures</b> within the Judith River Formation were controlled by lithostatic pressures of the overlying sediments during deepening of the valley, as well as interception of the Judith River Formation by the river alluvium upstream and downstream of the study site. The landslide at this site was formed as a direct result of downcutting of the river valley during deglaciation combined with lithostatic pressures within the underlying sandstone of the Judith River Formation and residual strength properties of the sediments at the shear zone. Interception of the Judith River Formation by the river thalweg upstream and downstream of the study site resulted in stabilization of this landslide during the latter stages of deglaciation. Aggrading of the North Saskatchewan River with the deposition of up to 33 metres of alluvial sand followed by increasing <b>artesian</b> pore-water <b>pressures</b> at less than lithostatic pressure within the Judith River Formation subsequent to deglaciation has maintained the stability of this landslide. A laboratory investigation using a direct shear test indicated the residual strength of the clay shale at the shear zone included a residual angle of shearing resistance of 6. 0 degrees with zero cohesion. A comprehensive back-analysis performed on the landslide at this site yielded values of residual strength parameters of internal angle of shearing resistance of 5. 3 Â° to 5. 8 Â° with zero cohesion for limiting equilibrium of the entire mass acting as one coherent unit.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for {{water in the}} Canterbury region, and the realisation that spring flow {{plays an important role}} in many wetland and river systems, requires methods for predicting changes in spring behaviour as Canterbury's groundwater resources are utilised. This study into the flow of groundwater through artesian spring systems provides a better understanding of the impacts of changes in artesian aquifer pressure. The aquifer system of the central coastal Canterbury Plains consists of gravels separated by successive layers of fine sediment. The fine sediment acts as a confining aquitard, creating artesian pressures in the gravel aquifers where the piezometric surface is above ground level. Artesian springs occur in the confining aquitard through localised zones of weakness. Piezometric levels associated with artesian springs in gravel aquifers are not well documented and have never been observed in Canterbury. Examination of near-spring groundwater flow patterns should confirm the shallow artesian aquifer as the main source of water to artesian springs. Little information is available on the relationship between artesian aquifer pressure and artesian spring discharge. Groundwater flow equations indicate that turbulence occurs in the high velocity flow encountered in artesian spring systems. Energy losses should thus be proportional to velocity squared and the pressure - flow relationship is expected to be non-linear. A non-linear relationship would buffer spring discharge against changes in aquifer pressure induced by groundwater abstraction. Field investigations were carried out at two spring sites near Christchurch. Near-spring water levels were observed in the aquifer directly below the spring to confirm it as the principal source of water to the spring. Variations in <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> were then induced via groundwater abstraction from nearby wells in the source aquifer, and changes in spring discharge measured. The upper confined aquifer was confirmed to be the primary source of water for Christchurch's artesian spring systems. The relationship between artesian aquifer pressure and artesian spring discharge was found to be entirely linear for the range of pressures and flows observed. Although theoretical analysis indicates that turbulent flow is occurring at, and close to, the spring vent, the distance over which it occurs is small enough that energy losses due to rapid flow in the groundwater system are negligible. The results imply that any reduction in <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> due to groundwater abstraction will have a direct, linear impact on artesian spring flow...|$|E

40|$|The glacier Holmstr+mbreen, in Spitsbergen, surged {{into the}} ice contact scarp of a proglacial outwash {{sequence}} at some time during its Neoglacial maximum. The outwash sediments were pushed along a decollement to produce a moraine in which deformation extended for 1. 5 km beyond the furthest extent of the glacier front. The style of folding and faulting {{and the nature of}} the pre-, syn- and post-tectonic sedimentary sequence across the whole push moraine is described from a continuously exposed section of the push moraine which extends from its proximal to distal extremities. The precise extent of incremental compressive shortening of the pushed sediments, of some 900 m, is established. The depth to the underlying decollement is inferred to be an average of about 30 m, indicating that stresses and movement were transmitted through a thin nappe with an aspect ratio of about 1 in 30. It is suggested that this nappe was frozen and that an <b>artesian</b> water <b>pressure</b> head of 60 m immediately beneath it reduced friction along its base to a very low value. It is calculated that a glacially generated force of about 1. 5] 107 kN was responsible for pushing the sediment nappe. The nature of the glacially controlled groundwater ßow system rather than the magnitude of longitudinal forces generated by the glacier is the principle determinant of large-scale push moraine characteristics.

40|$|The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is {{the hub of}} California's water {{distribution}} system, which consists of below sea-level islands surrounded by levees. Delta levees are constructed of local fill, have typically been unengineered and are notorious for breaching, causing flooding of the islands inside. One major concern is the seismic performance of Delta levees, which have not experienced a significant seismic event in over a century. Many of these levees are founded on local peaty organic soils, and the seismic performance of these levees is poorly understood. 	As part of a collaborative research investigation to study to study the seismic performance of Delta levees, a series of dynamic field tests were performed on a model levee constructed on very soft and compressible peaty organic soils on Sherman Island. This first-of-its-kind test applied dynamic loads to the model levee-peat system using the large NEES@UCLA MK- 15 eccentric mass shaker mounted on the levee crest. Two sets of tests were performed in 2011 and 2012. Geotechnical and geophysical investigations performed at the site found a 11 m thick peat deposit rests atop permeable Pleistocene sand. The peaty soils consist of 9 m of soft saturated peat with a Vs of 30 m/ and a 2 m stiff desiccated crust with a Vs of 60 m/s lying atop the soft peat. <b>Artesian</b> <b>pressures</b> exist in the soft saturated peat due to hydraulic connection with the nearby Sacramento River, with a zero effective stress condition existing at the peat-sand interface. Remote data monitoring measured settlement and pore pressure dissipation of the levee using embedded piezometers and a slope inclinometer. The remote monitoring found fast dissipation of pore pressures underneath the levee and continued settlement of the levee due to {{a high rate of}} secondary compression. Prior to the 2012 tests, a berm was constructed around the levee and the ground was flooded, to create more realistic soil conditions in the unsaturated crust. 	Dynamic base shear-displacement and moment-rotation relations were made for the levee. The model levee translated and rotated visibly during testing, demonstrating a response that differs from the one-dimensional wave propagation assumption used to analyze seismic levee response. High radiation damping was observed, and translation of the levee was found to go out-of-phase at peak shaker frequencies. Complex-valued stiffness of the levee-peat system was analyzed and compared to analytical solutions for a rigid foundation on an elastic halfspace. Little agreement was found between the field test results and the analytic solution, suggesting that the levee-peat foundation is flexible. 	Dynamic shear strains measured underneath the levee crest and toe measured an average value of shear strains {{at the bottom of the}} stiff crust and top of the soft peat. Peak shear strains measured during testing went up to 0. 4 %, with higher shear strains occurring underneath the levee toe, due to the rocking behavior. Comparison of residual pore pressure ratios generated during testing show a trend in increasing residual pore pressure with increasing shear strain. Comparison of field test results with dynamic laboratory testing showed very little increase in residual pore pressures from field tests, suggesting that pore pressures underneath the levee dissipated quickly due to high horizontal permeability. 	A series of finite element simulations were performed with elastic isotropic materials to compare different hypothetical soil conditions and loading scenarios. Good agreement in shear strains between the field test and the finite element simulations were found. Higher shear strains were found to exist beneath the levee for softer soils and uniform base excitation. A study investigated the development of shear stresses within the levee fill, and found an increase in peak shear stresses compared to shear stresses calculated for a simple shear case. This has implications for liquefaction triggering analysis, and the finite element simulations suggest that the current methodology used in evaluating seismic demand may be underestimating shear stresses within the levee fill...|$|R

40|$|A {{large part}} of western Manatee County {{is devoted to the}} growing of winter {{vegetables}} and citrus fruits. As in most of peninsular Florida, rainfall in the county during the growing season is not sufficient for crop production and large quantites of artesian water are used for irrigation. The large withdrawals of artesian water for irrigation result in a considerable decline of the artesian head {{in the western part of}} the county. This seasonal decline of the artesian head has become larger as the withdrawal of artesian water has increased. The lowering of the fresh-water head in some coastal areas in the State has resulted in an infiltration of sea water into the water-bearing formations. The presence of salty water in the artesian aquifer in parts of the coastal area of Manatee County indicates that sea water may also have entered the waterbearing formations in this area as a result of the decline of <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> during the growing season. The purpose of the investigation is to make a detailed study of the geology and ground-water resources of the county, primarily to determine whether salt-water encroachment has occurred or is likely to occur in the coastal area.

40|$|A {{number of}} wells {{penetrating}} the Floridan aquifer in eastern Clay County {{were found to}} be losing water to permeable zones above this aquifer. A differential in <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> was observed in closely spaced wells of similar depth. Further investigation. revealed that the pressure differential in the wells was due to the design of the wells, of which there were four principal types. A comparison of the four types of wells in relation to the subsurface geology showed that three types of wells were open to the permeable zones above the Floridan aquifer. In such wells water of relatively high head from the Floridan aquifer moves up through the well bore and out into zones of relatively low head. The estimated water loss from poorly designed wells ranged from 32 to 180 gpm (gallons per minute). The artesian head loss in leaky wells ranged from 3 to 15 feet. A total loss of water of 39 mgd (million gallons per day) was estimated from all the leaky wells in the area. A significant decline of the piezometric surface of the Floridan aquifer was observed in eastern Clay County. Some of this decline {{can be attributed to the}} loss of water from the Floridan aquifer through these poorly designed wells. (Document has 16 pages. ...|$|E
50|$|Until the 1970s {{there was}} a {{commercial}} watercress industry, run by the now-defunct Greatford Gardens Watercress Company, using water pumped from artesian bores reaching deep within the limestone strata of the Lincolnshire Wolds. In some years, the bores became naturally flowing <b>artesian</b> wells when <b>pressure</b> was sufficient to allow the water to reach the surface {{without the aid of}} pumps. Spring water with a slight alkalinity, such as that imparted by the limestone strata, is especially suitable for watercress. Some remnants of this industry can be found {{to the west of the}} old sluice gates, approximately eight hundred yards south of the Haven Inn. Other watercress beds owned by the company were located to the east of Ferry Road but have now been ploughed over and little evidence remains of their existence. At the eastern location, there were approximately twenty five watercress beds each ten yards wide by one hundred yards long. The beds were built with a slight gradient and water was directed through a channel into the highest end and then allowed flow gently down the length of the bed before leaving through a narrow opening at the lower end. The water then flowed into a channel which directed it into the Beck approximately fifty yards to the east of the Clew Gates. The watercress was gathered by hand and put onto wooden trays before being taken to a packing shed where it was divided into bundles, labelled and then the roots cut off. The bunches were then packed into wooden baskets, known as chips and transported by road to the rail and ferry centre at New Holland for delivery to customers. The severed roots were returned to the watercress bed where they were replanted. The company had similar watercress farms at Healing, Lincolnshire, Stamford, Lincolnshire and Fordingbridge, Hampshire. The company ceased its operations in Barrow Haven when it lost its water rights.|$|R
40|$|One {{hundred and}} twelve wells having drillers 2 ̆ 7 logs were studied in Pope and Faulkner counties. Sixty-six of the wells {{produced}} water from shales and siltstones of the Atoka Formation while 46 produced from interbedded Atoka sandstones. Drillers 2 ̆ 7 estimated well yields ranged from 1 to 100 gpm, but the median yield was only 9 gpm. Well depths ranged from 30 to 337 {{feet with a}} median depth of 100 feet. Ground-water is usually obtained {{from a series of}} low-producing confined aquifers of low <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure.</b> Pressure head and production were shown, statistically (a =. 01), to decrease with increasing well depth. This indicates that fractures and bedding-plane partings become more tight with depth associated with the increasing lithostatic pressure. Ground-water flow directions are generally to the south towards the Arkansas River with static water levels strongly conforming to the topography (a = 0. 001). A resistivity study was performed near Guy in Faulkner County to investigate the hypothesis that production is largely controlled by fracture porosity. The tri-potential resistivity technique was utilized to verify the presence of suspected fractures delinated from aerial photographs. Existing wells in the area produce estimated yields of 1 to 20 gpm. The well located in this study on verified fractures produced 120 gpm...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} the hydrochemical analyses performed on water samples collected during a field expedition in August 2013 to two former hydrocarbon exploration boreholes (> 2 km deep) in the West Siberian artesian megabasin. The sample sites were at Byelii Yar and at Goryachii Istochnik (near Parabel’), both in Tomsk oblast’. In neither case did the boreholes encounter significant hydrocarbon reserves; they currently overflow under <b>artesian</b> <b>pressure</b> {{at the surface}} and their geothermal water is used in simple spa resorts. In both cases, the waters are highly reducing; they contain H 2 S and methane (CH 4) as dissolved gases, and do not contain detectable concentrations of sulphate and nitrate. Both waters are rich in barium (an indicator of sulphate reduction) and strontium (an indicator of long residence time). The Byelii Yar borehole yields brackish water (mineralisation 1. 8 g/L) of Na-Cl type. The water is rich in strontium and very poor in Ca and Mg. The water contains around 11. 5 mg/L fluoride, rendering it unsuitable for human consumption on a regular basis. The Br/Cl ratio of the water suggests that the salt content is marine-derived (possibly marine connate water, or derived from a subsequent marine inundation). The water’s salinity suggests only a 4 - 5...|$|E
