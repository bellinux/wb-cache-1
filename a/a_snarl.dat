5|$|The central figure's {{mouth is}} {{positioned}} directly on its neck, {{rather than on}} a distinct face. It bares its teeth as if in <b>a</b> <b>snarl,</b> and is blindfolded by a drooping cloth bandage—a device likely drawn from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ. This creature faces the viewer directly and is centralised {{by a series of}} converging lines radiating {{from the base of the}} pedestal.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs {{engage in}} several {{displays}} during fights, hunting, or self-defence. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah {{will hold its}} head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce <b>a</b> <b>snarl</b> with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{nothing in}} the {{exhibition}} exemplifies this better than Gottfried Helnwein's 'Mickey'. His portrait of Disney's favorite mouse occupies an entire wall of the gallery; rendered from an oblique angle, his jaunty, ingenuous visage looks somehow sneaky and suspicious. His broad smile, encasing a row of gleaming teeth, seems more <b>a</b> <b>snarl</b> or leer. This is Mickey as Mr. Hyde, his hidden other self now disturbingly revealed.|$|E

25|$|Leonardo {{not only}} studied human anatomy, but {{the anatomy of}} many other animals as well. He {{dissected}} cows, birds, monkeys and frogs, comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. On one page of his journal Leonardo drew five profile studies of a horse with its teeth bared in anger and, for comparison, <b>a</b> <b>snarling</b> lion and <b>a</b> <b>snarling</b> man.|$|R
25|$|Information on {{fennec fox}} social {{behavior}} is mainly based on captive animals. The basic social unit {{is thought to}} be a mated pair and their offspring, and the young of the previous year are believed to remain in the family even after a new litter is born. Playing behavior is common, including among adults of the species. Fennec foxes make a variety of sounds, including barking, a purring sound similar to that of a domestic cat, and <b>a</b> <b>snarl</b> if threatened.|$|E
25|$|Dholes produce {{whistles}} {{resembling the}} calls of red foxes, sometimes rendered as coo-coo. How this sound is produced is unknown, {{though it is}} thought to help in coordinating the pack when travelling through thick brush. When attacking prey, they emit screaming KaKaKaKAA sounds. Other sounds include whines (food soliciting), growls (warning), screams, chatterings (both of which are alarm calls) and yapping cries. In contrast to wolves, dholes do not howl or bark. Dholes have a complex body language. Friendly or submissive greetings are accompanied by horizontal lip retraction and the lowering of the tail, as well as licking. Playful dholes open their mouths with their lips retracted and their tails held in a vertical position whilst assuming a play bow. Aggressive or threatening dholes pucker their lips forward in <b>a</b> <b>snarl</b> and raise the hairs on their backs, as well as keep their tails horizontal or vertical. When afraid, they pull their lips back horizontally with their tails tucked and their ears flat against the skull.|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Farrell {{played the}} main {{antagonist}} in the Fright Night remake, joining Anton Yelchin, David Tennant and Toni Collette {{in the story}} of a charismatic vampire who moves next door to a high-school student and his single mother. The film was released by DreamWorks, with Craig Gillespie (of Lars and the Real Girl) directing a script by Buffy the Vampire Slayer writer Marti Noxon. Sukhdev Sandhu of the Telegraph wrote that Farrell [...] "proves his comedy credentials once more....utterly seductive as the plushly eyebrowed carpenter-cum-bloodsucker", while the New York Timess A.O. Scott thought that Farrell played his role with [...] "a wink and <b>a</b> <b>snarl</b> and a feline purr". Logan Hill of New York magazine, on the other hand, was confused by the actor's performance: [...] "Sure, [...] may not make much sense, but neither do centuries-old vampires living in Nevadan subdivisions. So he goes for it." ...|$|E

500|$|In February 2009, Cooper hosted Saturday Night Live {{with musical}} guest TV on the Radio, portraying actor Christian Bale in one skit. Later that year, he {{appeared}} in a supporting role in the film He's Just Not That Into You. Cooper's breakthrough role came in Todd Phillips' comedy The Hangover (2009). He played Phil Wenneck, {{one of the three}} friends—alongside Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis—to wake up from a bachelor party in Las Vegas, with no memory of the previous night and the bachelor missing. The Hangover was a commercial success and finished as among the highest-grossing R-rated films in the United States. The New York Times A. O. Scott wrote: [...] "Mr. Cooper... offers the most interesting variation on an old standard, playing his aggressive, cocky frat boy with <b>a</b> <b>snarl</b> of rage that masks an anxiety as hard to account for as it is to miss." [...] For his performance, Cooper received an award at the 13th Hollywood Film Festival and his first nomination for MTV Movie Awards—Best Comedic Performance. The newspaper The Daily Telegraph opined that the success of the film turned Cooper into [...] "a bona fide leading man". Nevertheless, Cooper stated in a 2011 interview with Shave: [...] "It's the same. I mean, look, more doors have been opened for sure, but it's not like I sit back with a cigar on Monday morning and go through the scripts that have been offered." ...|$|E
2500|$|Irving Berlin quipped, [...] "The {{world would}} not be in such <b>a</b> <b>snarl,</b> had Marx been Groucho instead of Karl". In his book The Groucho Phile, Marx says [...] "I've been a liberal Democrat all my life", and [...] "I frankly find Democrats a better, more {{sympathetic}} crowd.... I'll continue to believe that Democrats have a greater regard for the common man than Republicans do". However, Marx also said in a television interview that he disliked the women's liberation movement.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the album's release, Chad Gilbert explained, [...] "The {{songs are}} all pretty different, sonically speaking" [...] {{and said that}} lead single [...] "It's Not Your Fault", has [...] "big, full guitars and a piano line that goes throughout. It's pretty anthemic, and Jordan's voice has never sounded better." [...] The guitarist {{also noted that the}} album's cleaner guitar sound was {{attributed}} to little distortion effects used in comparison to earlier albums, while describing [...] "On My Mind" [...] as [...] "this modern New Found Glory twist on a classic rock song." [...] Brendan Manley of Alternative Press called the album a [...] "statement of sentiment that stands apart in the NFG discography", while The Palm Beach Post opined that, [...] "Coming Home is similar, in spirit, to the 1990s crooning of Chicago's brilliant Smoking Popes. Jordan Pundik's vocal delivery curls into sweetness, rather than <b>a</b> <b>snarl.</b> Wrapped around journal-entry cute lines on the boppy, '80s-ish [...] "Hold My Hand" [...] and the earnestly protective pleadings of [...] "It's Not Your Fault." [...] Jack Foley of Indie London wrote [...] "Gilbert’s guitars are crisp, lively and fresh, while the vocal melodies are strong enough to have everyone singing along at some point. Take the feel-good romp that’s [...] "Too Good To Be" [...] for example. It’s vibrant in every sense, boasting some gloriously breezy guitar riffs and some fine vocal layering, with almost hand-clapping beats." ...|$|E
