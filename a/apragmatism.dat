40|$|É experimentado um novo psicotrópico — o P- 4657 B (Thiothixene) — em 14 doentes mentais crônicos (12 esquizofrênicos, um débil mental e um com depressão involutiva). O medicamento foi utilizado em doses que variaram entre 20 e 75 mg/dia, em período que oscilou entre 22 e 130 dias. Em um caso houve piora da sintomatologia; melhoras ocorreram em 5 casos, dois dos quais obtiveram alta experimental. No que se refere aos sintomas, melhores resultados foram obtidos em relação ao contato e à capacidade pragmática. Não foram notados efeitos colaterais severos, tendo sido verificadas manifestações neurodislépticas, discretas, em apenas três casos, sem relação com a dose empregada. Os autores concluem ser o Thiothixene um psicotrópico útil na terapêutica de doentes mentais crônicos, especialmente de esquizofrênicos nos quais predominem a deficiência de contato e o apragmatismo e sugerem a experimentação desse medicamento em psicoses agudas. A new {{psychotropic drug}} (P- 4657 B, Thiothixene) was tried in 14 {{patients}} with chronic syndromes (12 schizophrenics, one oligophrenic with psychotic reaction and one with involutional depression). The dosis varied between a minimal of 20 mg to a maximal of 75 mg per dien, per os, for 22 to 130 days. The results were as follows: very good improvement in two cases; three cases with good results; 8 cases remained unchanged and one case impaired. The best results, {{on account of the}} symptoms, were observed on the interpersonal communication and on pragmatism. Severe side effects were not present. Neurodisleptic manifestations, in mild degree, were observed only in three cases. The authors concluded that the Thiothixene is a useful neuroleptic in the treatment of chronic mental syndroms, specially in schizophrenics with bad personal communication and <b>apragmatism.</b> They also suggest the trial in acute psychosis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjectives: Cluster {{headache}} (CH) is a {{rare disease}} (1 to 3 / 1000), predominant in men (sex ratio: 4 men / 1 woman) and characterized by frequent very painful paroxystic attacks occurring sometimes 8 times by day. CH is a disease without lesion and impairs {{the quality of life}} of patients. Attacks occur only on the same hemiface and can last from 15 minutes to 3 hours. The pain is particularly severe and a frequent and extreme psychiatric symptomatology is observed during the attacks. Treatments are rare and not always efficient: sumatriptan, oxygen, LSD, psilocybin. In this paper we try to answer to the question: "What does that make you to have a cluster headache attack ? ", using elicitation interview developed by Vermersch. Patients and methods: Ten patients have been interviewed using elicitation interview (EI) (40 - 50 mn for one interview). All these patients (7 men and 3 women) T suffer from chronic or episodic CH, with a mean age of 43 years. The patients come from the Lariboisiere hospital (Paris), and more precisely from the center of headache urgency. EI allows describing the pre-reflexive consciousness contents. The method is described in Balzani and coll., and in Petitmengin and coll (see bibliography). Data analysis were performed using Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Results: From the EI, we have distinguished three phenomenological axes, following Heidegger’s philosophy: 1) An alteration of being-to-the-world with a strong unbearable feeling of imprisonment, and physical restriction. At the same time the patients present a stereotypical and automatic behavior with few motor schemes and escaping strategies. When pain arises, they want to leave and to go very far. Aggressive behavior frequenly occur. Sometimes, the patients are not able to perform the sumatripan injection, due to a motor inhibition. Some patients try to do autohypnosis or other methods to resist to the pain. 2) An alteration of being-to-the self, going from the corporal distortion to the body dissolution. At the onset of symptoms, the patient does the experience of physical deformation, particularly of the face, with strong vegetative symptoms. The patient is not able to control corporeal manifestations: tears, mad thinks, incoherent projects in order to stop the crisis. Some patients want to remove the part of their body where the pain is the most intense (eye, for example). There is a losing of the body limits and a loss of the time orientation. In many cases the pain is unbearable and patients want to commit suicide. At the extreme, the sensation of self seems destroyed, and some patients evoke an experience similar than Near Death Experiences, or describe an experience of swaying in emptiness or imminent death. 3) An alteration of being-to-the-other, going from the imperative solitude to the acceptance for a presence without words. Solitude is the most experience for the patients. They cannot accept anybody. Another person is unbearable, because asking questions about the crisis. In the same time, the patient is scared of this solitude since he is not able to speak about his painful experience. In summary, the structure of the self is altered, and thinking is completely disturbed. The experience of time and space is modified and <b>apragmatism</b> is a consequence of this intense pain. During the crisis, pain is central and the patient lives a kind of dissolution, near death: a self-dismantling. Conclusion: The EI have allowed us to describe precisely the painful experience of subjects with a cluster headache. This experience is very rich and very intense. EI, as a phenomenological method, is a very useful method to describe more precisely the symptomatology of a disease, because it pays attention to the effective experience of the pathological flesh, as compared to the pathological body. L’Algie Vasculaire de la Face (AVF) se manifeste par des accès douloureux paroxystiques fréquents et invalidants. L’intensité de la douleur est exceptionnellement sévère. Dans l’AVF, des manifestations psychiques ou comportementales sont retrouvées en cours de crise, avec une sémiologie pour le moins singulière, voire extrême. Ce travail phénoménologique veut tenter de répondre à la question : « Qu’est-ce que cela vous fait d’avoir une crise d’AVF ? » en utilisant la méthode dite d’entretien d’explicitation des vécus conscients. Trois axes phénoménologiques se différencient : (1) une altération de l’Être-au-monde attestée par une impression de restriction physique et d’enfermement insupportable, imposé, sans échappatoire; (2) une altération de l’Être-à-soi qui va de la déformation à la dissolution; (3) et une altération de l’Être-à-l’autre allant de la solitude impérative à la seule acceptation d’une présence sans mots...|$|E
