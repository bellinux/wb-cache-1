Airbus also considered using the new Engine Alliance GP7000 engine for the A330-300HGW, {{which would have been}} the engine's first twinjet application. The −300HGW was to enter airline service in 2004. However, the -300HGW programme was not launched <b>and</b> <b>quietly</b> disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Slow second movement, {{in a key}} {{different}} from the tonic, and in A–B–A (ternary) or A–B–A–B–A form. The main sections (A and B) are contrasted in key and character, A is slow and meditative; B is more intense and animated. The movement begins and ends slowly <b>and</b> <b>quietly.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the scene}} when Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie from the daycare center, babies are perched {{all over the}} building, staring at the family <b>and</b> <b>quietly</b> sucking on pacifiers. This is a spoof of the final shot of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. Indeed, a cartoon-version of Hitchcock can be seen walking his dogs past the daycare, a {{reference}} to his own cameo appearance in the film. The episode also contains an allusion to the opera scene in Citizen Kane, in which Homer plays with a shredded playbill while he watches {{his wife in the}} musical.|$|E
5|$|The initial bars of melody {{are warm}} <b>and</b> <b>quietly</b> authoritative, {{but at the}} mention of {{dwelling}} with Him the movement takes on a very different character. The bass line becomes enlivened with little leaps of delight... The singer's last note is a bottom d (c in the transposed version) several notes lower than a bass's accepted range.... when achieved it is an arresting sound, confirming the rock-like certainty of the promise that we shall eventually reside with God.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} {{impact of}} Roger and Larry's deaths left the band stranded, halting production. Without Roger {{serving as the}} creative source, they effectively disbanded, <b>and</b> <b>quietly</b> left the music industry altogether. Warner Bros. Records eventually dropped the band from their label, bringing the professional recording career of Zapp to a close. A few years later, Zapp resurfaced {{for a short period}} after the establishment of its own independent label, Zapp Town Records, managed by the Troutman family. The label released its only album, , in 2003. Zapp returned to performing only in live concert, touring across the U.S. at various venues.|$|E

5|$|When Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in January 1933, Fuchs {{decided to}} leave Kiel, where the NSDAP was {{particularly}} strong {{and he was a}} well-known KPD member. He enrolled at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin. On 28 February, he took an early train to Berlin for a KPD meeting there. On the train, he read about the Reichstag fire in a newspaper. Fuchs correctly assumed that opposition parties would be blamed for the fire, <b>and</b> <b>quietly</b> removed his hammer and sickle lapel pin.|$|E
5|$|A man of {{progressive}} and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, {{he had a}} special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert {{served as president of the}} Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and had to fight for every stage of the project. In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park. Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith. Albert thought such talk absurd <b>and</b> <b>quietly</b> persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{preceding}} the revolt, the Brazilian populace saw frequent {{changes in the}} country's political, economic, and social climate. For example, in May 1888, slavery in Brazil was abolished with the enactment into law of the Lei Áurea, a law vehemently opposed by the Brazilian upper class and plantation owners. This discontent among the upper parts of society directly led to a peaceful coup d'état spearheaded by the army and led by Benjamin Constant and Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca. Pedro II {{and his family were}} quickly <b>and</b> <b>quietly</b> sent into exile in Europe; they were replaced with a titular republic with Fonseca as president.|$|E

5|$|Sri {{is left in}} {{the living}} room as Aminah and their mother go to tend to Aminah's child, while their father goes to read the newspaper. Mahmud comes in, <b>and</b> <b>quietly</b> asks Sri to help him. He reveals that he had {{registered}} to join PETA several weeks prior and was to leave for training that very night, but was unsure of how Aminah would accept it. Sri tells him that she will ask her sister and has Mahmud hide in a wardrobe. After she leaves the room, Supono and Aminah enter from other doors. Supono, unknown to him, is in a similar situation to Mahmud, and Aminah convinces him to hide beneath a table as she asks Sri.|$|E
5|$|Movement {{catches the}} eye of prey animals {{on the lookout for}} predators, and of predators hunting for prey. Most methods of crypsis {{therefore}} also require suitable cryptic behaviour, such as lying down and keeping still to avoid being detected, {{or in the case of}} stalking predators such as the tiger, moving with extreme stealth, both slowly <b>and</b> <b>quietly,</b> watching its prey for any sign they are aware of its presence. As an example of the combination of behaviours and other methods of crypsis involved, young giraffes seek cover, lie down, and keep still, often for hours until their mothers return; their skin pattern blends with the pattern of the vegetation, while the chosen cover and lying position together hide the animals' shadows. The flat-tail horned lizard similarly relies on a combination of methods: it is adapted to lie flat in the open desert, relying on stillness, its cryptic coloration, and concealment of its shadow to avoid being noticed by predators. In the ocean, the leafy sea dragon sways mimetically, like the seaweeds amongst which it rests, as if rippled by wind or water currents. Swaying is seen also in some insects, like Macleay's Spectre stick insect, Extatosoma tiaratum. The behaviour may be motion crypsis, preventing detection, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two.|$|E
5|$|The {{funds for}} her {{continuing}} care {{were provided by}} Charles Widmore. As a result of Theresa's fate, Oxford fired Daniel <b>and</b> <b>quietly</b> removed all references to him ever having been at the university. At some point, Daniel also performed an experiment upon himself, resulting in long-term memory damage. While in Essex, Massachusetts, Daniel saw a news report covering {{the discovery of the}} apparent wreckage of Oceanic Flight 815 {{in the depths of the}} Sunda Trench. Widmore approached Daniel and after informing him that the Sunda Trench wreckage was a hoax, urged him to go to the island, which he said would heal him of his plight. At first, Daniel was reluctant, but Eloise convinced him to go. Daniel is then recruited into a covert team alongside Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader), Miles Straume (Ken Leung) and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), which is organized by Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick) and led by Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason). Their mission was to travel to the island, find Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), the then current leader of the Others, and disable the Dharma Initiative station called the Tempest, which contained poisonous gases.|$|E

5|$|The {{novel is}} set in the American South in the 1930s, during the time of Prohibition and Jim Crow laws that legalized racial {{segregation}} in the South. It begins with the journey of Lena Grove, a young pregnant white woman from Doane's Mill, Alabama, who is trying to find Lucas Burch, the father of her unborn child. He has been fired from his job at Doane's Mill and moved to Mississippi, promising to send word to her when he has a new job. Not hearing from Burch and harassed by her older brother for her illegitimate pregnancy, Lena walks and hitchhikes to Jefferson, Mississippi, a town in Faulkner's fictional Yoknapatawpha County. There she expects to find Lucas working at another planing mill, ready to marry her. Those who help her along her four-week trek are skeptical that Lucas Burch will be found, or that he will keep his promise when she catches up with him. When she arrives in Jefferson, Lucas is there, but he has changed his name to Joe Brown. Looking for Lucas, sweet, trusting Lena meets shy, mild-mannered Byron Bunch, who falls in love with Lena but feels honor-bound to help her find Joe Brown. Thoughtful <b>and</b> <b>quietly</b> religious, Byron is superior to Brown in every way but his shyness prevents him from revealing his feelings to Lena.|$|E
