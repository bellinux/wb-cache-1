25|$|Only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>ago,</b> {{the lads}} from Somerset had beaten Australia's finest by five wickets, chasing {{the highest score in}} one-day matches. Now, {{they failed to}} chase down 233 set by the Scottish Saltires, after Jonathan Beukes smashed 92 and Yasir Arafat {{supplied}} with a 20-ball 32 including two sixes. It started well enough for Somerset, Graeme Smith continuing his fine form with 74, leading his team to 158 for 4. But then, the wheels fell off. Paul Hoffmann snared the important wicket of James Hildreth for 49, the lower order rolled over meekly to Arafat (who got 3-33), and with Jon Francis injured, the Sabres managed to lose the match by 15 runs as they were all out for 218.|$|E
500|$|Trescothick {{was unable}} to avoid a {{recurrence}} of his previous difficulties when travelling abroad, however, and returned home on 15 October, citing the same [...] "stress related illness". Brian Rose, who Trescothick had approached initially after Somerset's defeat by Trinidad and Tobago on 12 October, released {{a statement to the}} media stating [...] "Marcus admitted <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>ago</b> that he wasn't 100% so that's fair enough. I think his future will be in domestic cricket and that may even help him with this particular form of illness. I think over {{the next two or three}} years you'll see Marcus Trescothick performing wonderfully well in county cricket." [...] Michael Vaughan, who had by then retired from cricket, praised Trescothick's [...] "courageous" [...] decision, as did Vikram Solanki, then PCA chairman. Journalist Andrew Miller called for an end to the rising criticism of Trescothick's decision from the public, while Paul Hayward of the Guardian also derided those critical of the Somerset player's actions. Despite returning home, Trescothick continued to affirm his commitment to the club by signing a new three-year contract with optional fourth year, in December. He was named captain for the 2010 season.|$|E

The crew also installed the control and power assemblies in the hatch leading into the MPLM. On the next day, the controllers were used to drive the bolts to release the MPLM from Node 2.|$|E

60|$|Ronny's news had upset Freddie. Derek had {{returned}} to the Albany <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>ago,</b> moody and silent. They had lunched together at the Bachelors, and Freddie had been pained at the attitude of his fellow-clubmen. Usually, when he lunched at the Bachelors, his table became a sort of social centre. Cheery birds would roll up to pass the time of day, and festive old eggs would toddle over to have coffee and so forth, and all that sort of thing. Jolly! On this occasion nobody had rolled, and all the eggs present had taken their coffee elsewhere. There was an uncomfortable chill in the atmosphere of which Freddie had been acutely conscious, though Derek had not appeared to notice it. The thing had only come home to Derek yesterday at the Albany, when the painful episode of Wally Mason had occurred. It was this way....|$|E
6000|$|I {{suppose that}} in the mysterious scheme of {{providence}} and fate such an inspiration as your charming note--out of the blue!--of <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>ago,</b> is intended somehow to make up to me for the terror with which my earlier--in fact all my past--productions inspire me, and for the insurmountable aversion I feel to looking at them again or to considering them in any way. This morbid state of mind is really a blessing in disguise--for it has for happy consequences that such an incident as your letter becomes thereby extravagantly pleasant and gives me a genial glow. All thanks and benedictions--I shake your hand very hard--or would do so if I could attribute to you anything so palpable, personal and actual as a hand. Yet I shall never write a sequel to the P. of an L.--admire my euphonic indefinite article. It's all too faint and far away--too ghostly and ghastly--and I have bloodier things en tête.

Upon the completion of the commission's labors, the Emperor invited the members of it to an audience, and in the course of the conversation he made a reference to me; continuing, he spoke of my chapter on the German language in [...] "A Tramp Abroad," [...] and characterized it by an adjective which is too complimentary for me to repeat here without bringing my modesty under suspicion. Then he paid some compliments to [...] "The Innocents Abroad," [...] and followed these with the remark that my account in one of my books of certain striking phases of German student life was the best and truest that had ever been written. By this I perceive that he remembers that dinner of sixteen years ago, for he said the same thing to me about the student-chapter at that time. Next he said he wished this gentleman to convey two messages to America from him and deliver them--one to the President, the other to me. The wording of the message to me was: ...|$|E
