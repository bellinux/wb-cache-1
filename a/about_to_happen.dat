5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E

[...] The Spanish version of the song does not contain a war metaphor and instead [...] "talks about walls coming down." ...|$|E

On 15 June Rosin and Mordowicz were interviewed by Oscar Krasniansky, the {{engineer}} who had translated the Vrba–Wetzler report into German. They told him that, between 15 and 27 May 1944, 100,000 Hungarian Jews had arrived at Birkenau, and that most were killed on arrival, apparently with no knowledge of what was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to them.

500|$|The {{wives of}} those {{involved}} and Anne Vaux (a friend of Garnet who often shielded priests at her home) became increasingly concerned by what they suspected was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Several of the conspirators expressed worries {{about the safety of}} fellow Catholics who would be present in Parliament {{on the day of the}} planned explosion. [...] Percy was concerned for his patron, Northumberland, and the young Earl of Arundel's name was brought up; Catesby suggested that a minor wound might keep him from the chamber on that day. [...] The Lords Vaux, Montague, Monteagle, and Stourton were also mentioned. [...] Keyes suggested warning Lord Mordaunt, his wife's employer, to derision from Catesby.|$|E

[...] The official remix features Eve, Trina, and Diamond, while Ludacris only has background vocals. The remix was also included on Battle of the Sexes, and {{an extension of the}} original video was made to accompany it. On the set of the video, Eve said, [...] "I’m just happy that Luda got this together and made this happen. This is just a nice prelude to what’s <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> I think it’s about to be another movement of strong women." ...|$|E
500|$|That evening, Wellesley College neuroscientist Bevil Conway {{gave some}} {{comments}} on the phenomenon to Wired reporter Adam Rogers.

Conway thought the reporter was exaggerating, saying, [...] "I didn't appreciate the full extent of what was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Not even close." [...] Rogers's story eventually got 32.8 million unique visitors. Meanwhile, when Conway woke up the next morning, his inbox had so many emails about the dress that at first, he thought his email had been hacked, until he saw that the bulk were interview requests from major media organisations.

In his absence, some of the Amahagger become restless and seize Mahomed, {{intending}} to eat him as part of a ritual [...] "hot pot". Mahomed dies from the hot pot. Realising what is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> Holly shoots several of the Amahagger; in the ensuing struggle Leo is gravely wounded, but Ustane saves his life by throwing herself onto his prostrate body to shield him from spears. All seems lost as the Amahagger resolve to kill Ustane along with the white men but Billali returns {{in the nick of time}} and declares that the three men are under the protection of She. Leo's condition, however, worsens and he nears death as Ustane faithfully attends to him.|$|E
500|$|When {{he began}} work on the score for A New Beginning, Manfredini created a theme just for the {{character}} of Tommy Jarvis. The idea was {{to suggest that there}} was [...] "madness afoot", which he believed helped to [...] "'point the finger' at various characters [...] to suggest that things were not as you might expect". For Jason Lives, Tom McLoughlin instructed Manfredini to create a score that would not alert the audience about what was happening or <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> [...] "but instead allow the audience to do it to themselves". McLoughlin took this idea from John Carpenter's 1978 film Halloween, which would always follow any shock in the film with Carpenter's [...] "Eeeeeeee!" [...] sound. McLoughlin wanted something more subtle, with a [...] "Gothic" [...] resonance.|$|E
500|$|When Harry Manfredini {{began working}} on the musical score for the 1980 film, the {{decision}} was made to play the music only alongside the killer so as not to trick the audience into believing that the killer was around during moments that they were not supposed to be. Manfredini explains that the lack of music for certain scenes was deliberate: [...] "There's a scene where one of the girls [...] is setting up the archery area [...] One of the guys shoots an arrow into the target and just misses her. It's a huge scare, but if you notice, there's no music. That was a choice." [...] Manfredini also noted that when something was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> the music would cut off so that the audience would relax a bit, which allowed the scare to become more effective.|$|E

500|$|In 2002 Schapira interviewed three {{anonymous}} Israeli soldiers, [...] "Ariel, Alexej and Idan," [...] {{who said}} they had been on duty at the IDF post that day. They knew something was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> one said, because of the camera crews that had gathered. One soldier said the live fire started from the high-rise Palestinian blocks known as [...] "the twins"; the shooter was firing at the IDF post, he said. The soldier added that he had not seen the al-Durrahs. The Israelis returned fire on a Palestinian station 30 metres {{to the left of the}} al-Durrahs. Their weapons were equipped with optics that allowed them to fire accurately, according to the soldier, and none of them had switched to automatic fire. In the view of the soldier, the shooting of Jamal and Muhammad was no accident. The shots did not come from the Israeli position, he said.|$|E
500|$|Homer's catchphrase, the annoyed grunt [...] "D'oh!", is {{typically}} uttered when he injures himself, {{realizes that he}} has done something stupid, or when something bad has happened or is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to him. During the voice recording session for a Tracey Ullman Show short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an [...] "annoyed grunt". Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out [...] "d'ooooooh". This was inspired by Jimmy Finlayson, the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33 Laurel and Hardy films. Finlayson had used the term as a minced oath to stand in for the word [...] "Damn!" [...] Matt Groening felt that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster. Castellaneta then shortened it to a quickly uttered [...] "D'oh!" [...] The first intentional use of D'oh! occurred in the Ullman short [...] "The Krusty the Clown Show" [...] (1989), and its first usage in the series was in the series premiere, [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire".|$|E

The budgets hadn't been opened up for me at that stage." [...] Hilson premiered the song at her producer and mentor Jamal [...] "Polow da Don" [...] Jones's launch party his newly created, Interscope-distributed record label, Zone 4, in Atlanta in July 2007. On choosing singles for In A Perfect World..., {{in an interview with}} Digital Spy, Hilson stated, [...] " [...] liked it a lot at first and said it should be a single, but just as that was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> he called it 'bubble bath music'. But now he loves it again and thinks it should be a single! He'll really change it up on you." [...] The song went for adds on urban airplay formats on July 21, 2009.|$|E
