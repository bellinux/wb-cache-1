5|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve the {{apparent}} differences between morphological and molecularly defined trees, a combined analysis was undertaken which confirmed superorder Liliiflorae as monophyletic, provided that a few modifications were undertaken. These included the removal of two tribes of Melanthiaceae (Melanthiales) and the inclusion of three additional families (Cyclanthaceae, Pandanaceae and Velloziaceae) from other superorders. This newly <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>narrowly</b> redefined Lilianae/Liliiflorae contained three orders, Aparagales, Liliales and Dioscoreales (which now included the stemonoids). This analysis also allowed {{for the establishment of}} a single synapomorphy, although this time by the presence of an inferior ovary. Significantly, the authors noted that it was no wonder the authors of angiosperm classifications had been exasperated by the Lilianae.|$|E

500|$|The wider {{rhythm and}} blues boom overlapped, both {{chronologically}} {{and in terms of}} personnel, with the later <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>narrowly</b> focused British blues boom. The blues boom began to come to prominence in the mid-1960s as the {{rhythm and blues}} movement began to peter out leaving a nucleus of instrumentalists with a wide knowledge of blues forms and techniques. Central to the blues boom were John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, who began to gain national and international attention after the release of Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton (Beano) album (1966), considered one of the seminal British blues recordings. Peter Green started a [...] "second great epoch of British blues", as he replaced Clapton in the Bluesbreakers after Clapton's departure to form Cream.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Streep lobbied to {{play the}} lead role in Oliver Stone's {{adaption}} of the play Evita, but two months before filming was due to commence, she dropped out, citing [...] "exhaustion" [...] initially, although it was later revealed {{that there was a}} dispute over her salary. By the end of the decade, Streep actively looked to star in a comedy. She found the role in She-Devil (1989), a satire that parodied Hollywood's obsession with beauty and cosmetic surgery, in which she played a glamorous writer. Though not a success, Richard Corliss of Time wrote that Streep was the [...] "one reason" [...] to see the film and observed that it marked a departure from the dramatic roles she was known to play. Reacting to her string of poorly received films, Streep said: [...] "Audiences are shrinking; as the marketing strategy defines more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>narrowly</b> who they want to reach—males from 16 to 25—it's become a chicken-and-egg syndrome. Which came first? First they release all these summer movies, then do a demographic survey of who's going to see them".|$|E

60|$|In {{the mean}} time, the Protestant party in Scotland, or the rebels, as Queen Mary and her {{government}} called them, had had very {{hard work to}} maintain their ground. There was a large French force already there, and their co-operation and aid made the government too strong for the insurgents to resist. But, when Elizabeth's English army crossed the frontier, the face of affairs was changed. The French forces retreated in their turn. The English army advanced. The Scotch Protestants came forth from the recesses of the Highlands to which they had retreated, and, drawing closer and closer around the French and the government forces, they hemmed them in more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>narrowly,</b> and at last shut {{them up in the}} ancient town of Leith, to which they retreated in search of a temporary shelter, until the French fleet, with re-enforcements, should arrive.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is also a}} delicate, and no very {{grateful}} task, to dissert upon the literature and manners of a nation so dissimilar; and requires an attention and impartiality which would induce us,--though perhaps no inattentive observers, nor ignorant of the language or customs of the people amongst whom we have recently abode--to distrust, or at least defer our judgment, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>narrowly</b> examine our information. The state of literary, {{as well as political}} party, appears to run, or to have run, so high, that for a stranger to steer impartially between them is next to impossible.
