25|$|Silver Surfer and Dawn meet Glorian the Maker of Miracles, {{who plans}} to rebuild our {{universe}} for the heroes to return to after they finish in Battleworld. Glorian has also {{enlisted the help of}} the Shaper of Worlds. Glorian then greeted Silver Surfer and Dawn with <b>a</b> <b>tantalizing</b> offer: ally with the Shaper of Worlds to rebuild the universe that was lost. Dawn agreed to use her memories to restore Earth while Silver Surfer left to restore the rest of the universe, but Silver Surfer unmade Galactus while Dawn unknowingly created another version of Norrin. The Shaper of Worlds is not happy with the changes.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Federer won {{his first}} Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon, beating Andy Roddick in the semifinals and Mark Philippoussis in the final. In August {{he had a chance}} to take over the #1 ranking for the first time from Andre Agassi if he made it to the Montreal final. However, he fell in the semifinals to Roddick, in a final set tiebreaker leaving him <b>a</b> <b>tantalizing</b> 120 points behind Agassi. This, coupled with early losses to David Nalbandian at Cincinnati and the US Open, denied Federer the chance to become #1 for the {{duration}} of the season.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews were mixed. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan {{wrote that}} [...] "Keith himself is {{responsible}} {{for all of the}} album's good moments. Even when he's in unhinged-rant mode, Keith's imagery often remains lucid. And so the album's best song is [...] "Ants," [...] where he comes off frantic but omnipotent...It's dense and fascinating stuff, <b>a</b> <b>tantalizing</b> glimpse of what might've happened if Keith hadn't treated the reemergence of his most popular persona like an easy payday." [...] PopMatters writer Michael Frauenhofer wrote that [...] "The Return of Dr. Octagon is still better than anything Kool Keith's done in a little while, but apart from its best tracks, it's not close to the level of his finest work of the past, and it doesn't really build much on the legend of Dr. Octagon, which still rests most firmly on the good doctor's debut." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>As</b> <b>tantalizing</b> as {{it might}} be to {{speculate}} on the relationship between her arrival in Honolulu and the [...] "Bloodless Revolution of 1887" [...] carried out during her extended stay in Honolulu, neither she nor her sailors participated in the events ashore. Her presence, however, probably fostered an air of sanguinity in the minds of those Americans who carried out reforms in the government of the native monarch. The political situation ashore did prompt the extension of her visit until almost three weeks after the elections held on 12 September. Adams steamed out of Honolulu on 2 October.|$|R
5000|$|The action ... is {{full-bodied}} melodrama of {{a shrewd}} and sophisticated sort. Never {{so far away}} from reason that it is wholly incredible but obviously manufactured fiction, it makes <b>a</b> tolerably <b>tantalizing</b> show, reaching some points of fascination in a few of its critical scenes.|$|R
500|$|Garfield's biographers, {{and those}} who have studied his {{presidency}}, tend to think well of him, and that his presidency saw a promising start before its untimely end. Historian Justus D. Doenecke, while deeming Garfield a bit of an enigma, chronicles his achievements, [...] "by winning a victory over the Stalwarts, he enhanced both the power and prestige of his office. As a man, he was intelligent, sensitive, and alert, and his knowledge of how government worked was unmatched." [...] Yet Doenecke criticizes Garfield's dismissal of Merritt in Robertson's favor, and wonders if the president was truly in command of the situation even after the latter's confirmation. According to Caldwell, writing in 1931, [...] "If Garfield lives in history, it will be partly on account of the charm of his personality—but also because in life and in death, he struck the first shrewd blows against a dangerous system of boss rule which seemed for a time about to engulf the politics of the nation. Perhaps if he had lived he could have done no more." [...] Rutkow writes, [...] "James Abram Garfield's presidency is reduced to <b>a</b> <b>tantalizing</b> 'what if.|$|E
2500|$|Many such as June Singer {{have argued}} that Blake's {{thoughts}} on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst Carl Jung. In Jung's own words: [...] "Blake [...] <b>a</b> <b>tantalizing</b> study, since he compiled a lot of half or undigested knowledge in his fantasies. According to my ideas they are an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes." [...] Similarly, although less popularly, Diana Hume George claimed that Blake {{can be seen as}} a precursor to the ideas of Sigmund Freud.|$|E
2500|$|The {{magnetic}} dipole moment (g) of a charged lepton (electron, muon, or tau) is very nearly 2. [...] The difference from 2 (the [...] "anomalous" [...] part) depends on the lepton, and can be computed quite exactly based on the current Standard Model of particle physics. [...] Measurements of the electron are in excellent agreement with this computation. [...] The Brookhaven experiment did this measurement for muons, a much more technically difficult measurement due to their short lifetime, and detected <b>a</b> <b>tantalizing,</b> but not definitive, 3σ discrepancy between the measured value and the computed one.|$|E
2500|$|Presque vu ( [...] , from French, meaning [...] "almost seen") is {{the intense}} {{feeling of being}} on the very brink of a {{powerful}} epiphany, insight, or revelation, without actually achieving the revelation.

2500|$|.....Like Clockwork has {{received}} critical acclaim. According to Metacritic, {{it is their}} most acclaimed album since Songs for the Deaf, with an average score of 82, based on 46 reviews. Giving the album {{four and a half}} stars out of five, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented that [...] "'...Like Clockwork' is unusually focused for a Queens of the Stone Age record, containing all of the group's hallmarks— namely volume and crunch, but also <b>a</b> <b>tantalizing</b> sense of danger, finding seduction within the darkness." [...] At Alternative Press, Dan Slessor wrote that [...] "surrendering to its strange charms {{could be one of the}} smartest decisions you make this year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Christa L. Titus from Billboard {{felt that}} the band [...] "proved its potency" [...] with songs like [...] "The Kill", [...] "Was It a Dream?", and [...] "From Yesterday", and praised Leto's vocal ability by writing, [...] " [...] {{alternates}} between cathartic shouts and <b>a</b> <b>tantalizing</b> croon that shows his capable vocal range." [...] Kaj Roth from Melodic praised the sonic variety and summarized the record as [...] "an impressive list of anthemic rock songs." [...] Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic echoed this sentiment, writing that A Beautiful Lie [...] "works well as an album due to greater variety". He also found the record [...] "a more controlled effort" [...] than the band's debut album 30 Seconds to Mars (2002). Kerrang! magazine called it a [...] "great album to {{close your eyes and}} fall in to, an anthemic eruption of upfront emotion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chet Raymo, physics {{professor}} at Stonehill College writes that [...] "Ray Kurzweil {{has a better}} record than most at foreseeing the digital future" [...] and [...] "Kurzweil paints <b>a</b> <b>tantalizing</b> — and sometimes terrifying — portrait of {{a world where the}} line between humans and machines has become thoroughly blurred". He says the book is a [...] "welcome challenge to beliefs we hold dear" [...] and feels we can only shape the future if we anticipate it first. Jim Bencivenga, staff writer for The Christian Science Monitor, says Kurzweil [...] "possesses a highly refined and precise ability to think exponentially about technology over time". Bencivenga also says we should take Kurzweil's predictions very seriously because of his [...] "proven track record". Lyle Feisel, former electrical engineering professor, writes the predictions from Kurzweil's The Age of Intelligent Machines [...] "have largely come true" [...] and so [...] "engineers and computer scientists would do well to give [...] a read".|$|E
60|$|Putting all care behind them, {{the young}} folks {{ran down the}} hill, with a very lively dog gambolling beside them, and took <b>a</b> delightfully <b>tantalizing</b> survey of the {{external}} charms of the big tent.

50|$|Love Eternal, Sounds, 1986Haig, meanwhile, {{is still}} not quite the man in form but this is his most durable for ages - a decidedly East-European trek to the {{outskirts}} of <b>a</b> teasing, <b>tantalizing</b> melody. The press release proclaims this as his shining hour and, by jiminy, they could be right. Someone should sign these trouble-makers up, or pray for miracles.|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic writer Alexey Eremenko {{gave the}} album four-and-a-half stars out of five, praising the {{originality}} {{and variety of}} styles by saying: [...] "The debut album by Mattafix is <b>a</b> pleasantly <b>tantalizing</b> experience of guessing the sound and never being quite there -- because Mattafix has taken the old elements and made them into something new, or at least untried before." ...|$|R
2500|$|There {{are some}} notable {{similarities}} between portrayals {{of women in}} The Mystery of the Sea and Stoker's more famous Dracula; Mina Harker and Marjory Drake both begin as assertive, intelligent women with some almost masculine qualities by Victorian standards (for instance, Mina knows the train schedules, and Marjory recognizes that Archibald must reduce the cipher in order to crack it). Hopkins compares Mina Harker and Marjory Drake by designating them both as [...] "uneasily poised between New Woman and proper wife", and {{by pointing out that}} [...] "Marjory…like Mina, explicitly disavows any sympathy with the most prominent of the New Women's aims". Thus, the New Woman in Stoker's novels appears to be more of <b>a</b> <b>tantalizing</b> threat than a tangible reality. The somewhat rebellious qualities of these heroines are ultimately little more than pleasing additions that add interest to females who become more passive and surrender to the authority of their husbands. In general, Archibald (and presumably Stoker himself) is attracted to the New Woman, but wants to subdue her rather than to allow her to continue her independent existence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{episode was}} watched by 14.3 million US viewers, and {{attained}} a 5.2/14 in the 18-49 demographic. It was watched by 2.16 million Canadian viewers, {{making it the}} first debut of the 2009 Canadian TV season to attain over 2 million viewers. The episode received generally favorable reviews, with E! Online rating it 11/10 and calling it [...] "the best pilot we've seen in, well, forever." [...] USA Today Robert Bianco put V on his list of the top ten new shows of the TV season, stating that the remake is well-made and [...] "quickly establishes its own identity." [...] Comparing it to the original series, Bianco noted that the remake {{could easily have been}} a failure, yet managed to [...] "contemporize the story without drowning it in paranoia." [...] Maureen Ryan for the Chicago Tribune noted that the [...] "character drama" [...] in the pilot episode was [...] "clunky" [...] but overall found the episode [...] "solidly entertaining and suitably suspenseful." [...] Ken Tucker for Entertainment Weekly graded the episode 'B+' calling it [...] "excellently acted" [...] and noting that Mitchell is [...] "fast becoming TV's go-to gal for strong, brainy women of action". Variety's Brian Lowry opined that the episode [...] "busily races through too much business, but it dangles <b>a</b> <b>tantalizing</b> array of plots, and features a knockout performance (in more ways than one) by Morena Baccarin as the cool, beguiling alien leader." [...] He called Baccarin the [...] "real breakout" [...] star of the episode, deeming Anna [...] "TV's coolest alien since the invention of the Vulcan nerve pinch." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephen King {{liked the}} film, stating: [...] "Of Fox's two summer creepshows , give the edge to The Happening, partly because M. Night Shyamalan really understands fear, partly because this time he's {{completely}} let himself go (hence the R rating), {{and partly because}} after Lady in the Water {{he had something to}} prove". Critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, awarding the movie three stars, found it [...] "oddly touching": [...] "It is no doubt too thoughtful for the summer action season, but I appreciate the quietly realistic way Shyamalan finds to tell a story about the possible death of man". William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called it [...] "something different—and a pleasant surprise" [...] among that summer's major Hollywood releases, and approved of its taking [...] "the less-is-best approach." [...] The New York Times’ Manohla Dargis praised Wahlberg's lead performance, adding that the film [...] "turns out to be a divertingly goofy thriller with an animistic bent, moments of shivery and twitchy suspense". Philipa Hawker of The Age gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting on [...] "the mood of the film: <b>a</b> <b>tantalizing,</b> sometimes frustrating parable about the menaces that human beings might face from unexpected quarters," [...] drawing special attention to [...] "the sound of the breeze and the sight of it ruffling the trees or blowing across the grass— an image of tension that calls to mind Antonioni's Blowup". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times said, [...] "It almost dares you to roll your eyes or laugh at certain scenes that are supposed to be deadly serious. But, you know what, I appreciated this creatively offbeat, daring sci-fi mind-trip". Reviewer Rumsey Taylor said that the film moves forward with [...] "jack-in-the-box suspense, traipsing from one garish death to another in a parade of cartoonish terror," [...] and noted how the film seemed like [...] "Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds, only without the birds." ...|$|E
6000|$|Billy Gale called [...] "Play," [...] and {{the game}} began with Slugger Blandy at bat. The {{formidable}} {{way in which he}} swung his club did not appear to have any effect on Frank Price or the player back of him. Frank's most successful pitch was <b>a</b> slow, <b>tantalizing</b> curve, and he used it. Blandy lunged at the ball, missed it and grunted.|$|R
60|$|Wayne hurried up to {{the plate}} and took his position. He had always been a timely hitter, and he gritted his teeth in his resolve to settle this game. Mackay whirled his long arm, wheeled, took his long stride, and pitched <b>a</b> slow, <b>tantalizing</b> ball that seemed never to get anywhere. But Wayne waited, timed it perfectly, and met it squarely.|$|R
60|$|She moved {{towards him}} with very short steps, her {{head a little}} on one side, hands on hips, with a slight {{balancing}} of her body: <b>an</b> approach more <b>tantalizing</b> than <b>an</b> escape. He looked on, eager--charmed. She spoke jestingly.|$|R

60|$|Steerforth was considerate, too; {{and showed}} his consideration, in one {{particular}} instance, in an unflinching manner that was <b>a</b> little <b>tantalizing,</b> I suspect, to poor Traddles and the rest. Peggotty's promised letter--what a comfortable letter it was!--arrived before 'the half' was many weeks old; {{and with it}} a cake in a perfect nest of oranges, and two bottles of cowslip wine. This treasure, as in duty bound, I laid {{at the feet of}} Steerforth, and begged him to dispense.|$|R
60|$|Joe {{was in a}} predicament, and <b>a</b> very <b>tantalizing</b> one at that.

When Joe saw the gun aimed at him for the third time, he backed water hastily. As a result, the skiff came to a standstill, and the soldier, {{lowering}} his rifle, regarded him intently.|$|R
6000|$|All {{this and}} much more is {{followed}} by <b>a</b> most <b>tantalizing</b> and puzzling P.S. to poor Richardson. His fair, or rather “brown as an oak-wainscot, with a good deal-of-country-red in her cheeks” correspondent, requests him “to direct only to C.

6000|$|... 'O no--it doesn't {{matter at}} all. But, certainly, three hundred for two is <b>a</b> <b>tantalizing</b> sum: {{not enough to}} enable us to change our condition, and enough to make us {{dissatisfied}} with going on as we are.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{despatched}} the letter, and half-an-hour afterwards {{felt sure}} that it would mortally offend her. But he had now reached a state of temporary indifference, and could contemplate the loss of such <b>a</b> <b>tantalizing</b> property with reasonable calm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, with <b>a</b> <b>tantalizing</b> coquetry {{that might}} have {{suggested}} an underlying seriousness. [...] "I think you HAVE lost a good deal. Perhaps, so have I. We might have been good friends in all these years. But that is past." ...|$|E
60|$|In secret, however, Columbus was {{exceedingly}} indignant at {{the conduct}} of Ovando.

He had, at length, sent <b>a</b> mere <b>tantalizing</b> message, by <b>a</b> man known to be one of his bitterest enemies, with a present of food, which, from its scantiness, seemed intended to mock their necessities.|$|R

60|$|All this {{amounts to}} a huge {{impoverishment}} of life, a loss of beauty and discrimination of rich and subtle values. Human existence to-day is <b>a</b> mere <b>tantalizing</b> intimation of what it might be. It is frostbitten and dwarfed from palace to slum. It is not only that a great mass of our population is deprived of space, beauty and pleasure, but that {{a large proportion of}} such space, beauty and pleasure as there are in the world must necessarily have a meretricious taint and be in the nature of things bought and made for pay.|$|R
