40|$|The {{ability to}} define and control the {{topography}} of a surface has been studied extensively due to its importance {{in a wide variety}} of applications. The control of a non-planar topography would be very valuable since a number of structures that are pervasive in artificial applications (e. g. fibers, lenses) are curved interfaces. This potential of enabling applications that incorporate non-planar geometries was the motivation for this thesis. The first study of this thesis comprises the study of patterning the circumference of micrometer sized fibers. Specifically, a unique technique was described to pattern the fiber with a periodic array of colloids. The effect of immobilizing fibers on different substrates and the parameters that govern a successful transfer of the colloidal array onto 7 mm diameter fibers were studied. Finally, replication of inverse submicrometer patterns onto the diameter of the fiber is completed with mild removal of the colloidal template. The second component of the thesis is the patterning of fabric assemblies of fibers. Composites of soft elastomer resins and rigid fiber materials are explored for their complimentary properties. Specifically, the organization of the fiber structure was contrasted with other homogenous materials. These composites were shown to possesses rigid in-plane strength, yet remain flexible to bending deformation. Furthermore, the carbon fiber fabric composites demonstrate superior tensile strength and greater flexibility than common homogenous materials such as PET and crosslinked elastomers. Finally, the use of a liquid resin permits submicrometer patterns to form on the periphery of the fabric assembly. The final component of the thesis is the use of the patterned fabric <b>assemblies</b> <b>for</b> <b>adhesive</b> applications. Carbon fiber-elastomer composites were patterned with submicrometer shear adhesion. The effects of the pattern size and orientation on the shear adhesion were studied. By varying the velocity of the sample testing, adhesion was observed to change for different patterned samples. We highlight the aspects of the fabric composite and the patterning that permits the features to alter the adhesion. Finally, we suggest how these results could be designed to improve the shear adhesion of reversible adhesives...|$|R
40|$|Resistance and {{nonlinearity}} of {{the current}} vs. voltage characteristics (NAVC) of adhesive joints was investigated. The joints were prepared of four types of electrically conductive adhesives (ECA) on Cu clad FR 4 laminate and on Cu clad FR 4 laminate with gold coating on the Cu. The circuit layer was designed to make 4 -point measurements possible. Adhesives were applied by dispensing. The boards were assembled by resistors of the value 0 Ω recommended <b>for</b> <b>assembly</b> using <b>adhesives.</b> The samples were aged at the temperature of 200 °C and 160 °C, respectively, for different time. Significant changes of resistance and NAVC were found during aging of adhesives. It was found that NAVC is a parameter, which is very sensitive to changes of ECA and therefore could be very useful for diagnostics of these materials...|$|R

Industrial experience and academic studies to date indicate the initial stages of the <b>assembly</b> process <b>for</b> anisotropic <b>adhesive</b> joints are particularly significant to the successful formation and long term performance of the completed assembly. The consistency of the process is controlled by the early stages of compression and the resulting distribution of conducting particles is affected by the adhesive resin flow {{in the early stages of}} the assembly process. The bump geometry on flip chip assemblies has been found to be critical to the success of the process as it significantly affects the early stages of the adhesive film compression. This paper describes analytical and CFD models which explore the time required to squeeze out the adhesive as a function of applied pressure, temperature ramp rate, and adhesive viscosity. The results of a study on adhesive rheology are presented and used in the flow models. The paper also explores the flow of conducting particles within the adhesive, and hence the final particle distribution underneath the flip chip. This distribution has been shown in the past to significantly affect the probabilities of shorts and open...|$|R
