25|$|The comic book's {{publishing}} {{was started}} in 1972 by the state-owned company Vjesnik from Zagreb. This edition is still a popular collectors' item.

A writer himself who penned several comedic novels about the clumsy detective character called Timothy Tacher, Brixy approached the job of translating Alan Ford in a free form and the resulting witty adaptation and imaginative text soon won him many admirers across the country.|$|E
