30|$|Several {{previous}} studies have addressed how to represent differences in test-taking disengagement and how these are related to person <b>and</b> <b>item</b> characteristics. The present study adds to them {{by focusing on the}} adult population as assessed in the Canadian sample of the PIAAC. Furthermore, unlike {{previous studies}}, we propose a model-based approach assuming both (random) person <b>and</b> <b>item</b> effects on test-taking disengagement, and incorporate explanatory variables at both the person <b>and</b> <b>item</b> levels as well as their interaction to test the hypothesis of informed disengagement.|$|R

30|$|To {{obtain a}} {{conjoint}} measurement scale {{that applies to}} both person ability <b>and</b> <b>item</b> difficulty parameters, in the Rasch model, person <b>and</b> <b>item</b> parameters can be calculated by converting the raw scores into logits (logarithm of odds units; for more detailed information on parameter estimation, see, e.g., Linacre, 1998; Strobl, 2010).|$|R

5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) {{takes his}} new companion Clara Oswald (Jenna-Louise Coleman) to the Rings of Akhaten, where several planets revolve around a larger one. They attend a religious festival where the young Queen of Years, Merry Gejelh (Emilia Jones), {{is about to}} be sacrificed. Determined to save Merry, the Doctor and Clara come face-to-face with the parasite of Akhaten, who requires memories, stories, <b>and</b> <b>items</b> of sentimental value.|$|E
30|$|Our {{quantitative}} data analysis procedure consisted of four main steps. First, we calculated measures {{of student achievement}} <b>and</b> <b>item</b> difficulty using the dichotomous Rasch model (Rasch 1960). Briefly, the Rasch model is a statistical approach {{that can be used}} to examine student responses to items in educational assessments in order to obtain measures of student achievement <b>and</b> <b>item</b> difficulty. This approach is based on a transformation of assessment item responses from an ordinal scale to a log-odds (logit) scale, such that measures of student achievement <b>and</b> <b>item</b> difficulty can be expressed on a common linear scale with equal units.|$|R
30|$|In {{case of the}} IGFP- 5 R, the Extraversion {{items are}} linked to Reserve (<b>item</b> 12), Shyness <b>and</b> Inhibition (<b>item</b> 16), <b>and</b> Silence (<b>item</b> 42). The items of the Conscientiousness factor are {{associated}} to Negligence (item 17), Sloth (item 19), Forgetfulness (<b>Item</b> 22), <b>and</b> Disorganization (<b>item</b> 38). The Agreeableness items are related to Amiability (<b>items</b> 15 <b>and</b> 18) <b>and</b> Cooperation (<b>item</b> 8). The Neuroticism items are linked to Instability (<b>item</b> 10) <b>and</b> Fear (<b>items</b> 34 <b>and</b> 36). Finally, {{the items on the}} Openness factor are associated with Creativity (<b>items</b> 9 <b>and</b> 11) <b>and</b> Intellectuality (<b>item</b> 39).|$|R
30|$|The seven {{items of}} the WHOQOL-bref that {{exhibited}} a significant change (p[*]<[*] 0.05) in scores from the first to the second interview are examined in depth below, namely, item 1, quality of life perception; four physical domain items, including <b>item</b> 3, pain <b>and</b> discomfort, <b>item</b> 4, medication or treatment dependence, <b>item</b> 16, sleep <b>and</b> rest, <b>and</b> <b>item</b> 18, working capacity; <b>and</b> two <b>items</b> from the psychological domain – item 6, spirituality/religion/personal beliefs <b>and</b> <b>item</b> 7, thinking, learning, memory and concentration (Additional file 1).

5|$|Player characters' combat {{abilities}} and skills are dictated by a character class-based job system. The {{jobs in the}} initial launch were Warrior, Priest, Mage, Martial Artist, Thief, and Minstrel. Later updates added further jobs, such as the Beast Tamer and Dancer. Each job has a separate skill point system that allows customization, and jobs can be changed at dedicated temples found in each major town. Player characters can also adopt Trades, skills that include woodwork, weapon and armor forging among others. Each Trade skill requires materials gathered from the overworld, which are then {{used to create a}} specific type of equipment unique to the gathered materials and Trade. Weapons <b>and</b> <b>items</b> are acquired either in battle alongside in-game currency or through Guilds scattered through Bazaars located in major towns. Guilds will forge new gear, weapons <b>and</b> <b>items</b> for a combined fee of money and materials salvaged from the game world. Also found in towns are vendors where excess items can be stored, merchants which buy and sell various items, and tailor's establishments where the player character can gain new outfits.|$|E
5|$|Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Unlimited is {{an update}} to {{original}} arcade release, Tekken Tag Tournament 2. It features {{a number of}} new items and customization options. It also gives the game a balance update from characters <b>and</b> <b>items.</b> It was released to Japanese arcades on March 27, 2012 and the console version of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 is based on this arcade version.|$|E

5|$|The game {{includes}} a research function. When new objects are {{encountered in the}} game, especially enemies, their organs can be collected and, when combined with chemicals found in storage rooms, the player can research the enemies and thus improve their damage against them. Similarly, some exotic weapons <b>and</b> <b>items</b> can only be used after being researched. OSA agents effectively have a separate weapons tree available to them. Psionic powers can be learned, such as invisibility, fireballs, and teleportation.|$|E
5|$|After {{targeting}} another {{character and}} initiating combat, the player and his opponent will damage each other automatically with their weapons. This continues until the player stops or {{the target is}} dead. Each profession's unique nano programs, perks and research also provide combat abilities used by the player during the fight. These can heal the owner, cause additional damage, lower {{the skills of the}} enemy, blind them or otherwise hinder the enemy's ability to fight. Once the target is dead, the player is able to loot money <b>and</b> <b>items</b> from the enemy's body.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} titles, Ninja Gaiden III received mostly positive reviews from critics. Early reviews praised the game for its plot, gameplay, and difficulty; later reviews criticized it for that plot being overly outlandish, inconsistent level designs, and the game's difficulty level, in which the North American version was intentionally made harder than the Japanese version through limited continues, stronger enemies, and omission of a password system. The Atari Lynx port, while receiving general praise for graphics and controls, received poor reception for its sound and for the inability for players to see characters <b>and</b> <b>items,</b> attributing it to the Lynx's small screen.|$|E

30|$|One {{version of}} the EPE was used from 1998 to 2005, while another version was used from 2006 to 2011. Both {{versions}} of the EPE were identical in terms of structure and have equal numbers of corresponding <b>items</b> <b>and</b> questions. Content validity studies, correlation studies, <b>and</b> <b>item</b> analysis comparisons verify that the {{two versions of the}} EPE used in this study were equivalent in terms of test content, <b>item</b> difficulty <b>and</b> <b>item</b> discrimination (sees Sims and Liu 2013).|$|R
30|$|Another related {{concern is}} {{with the loss of}} <b>items</b> <b>and</b> the content {{validity}} of the scales. As other reduced scales, ER 5 FP and IGFP- 5 R have a limited coverage of the constructs when compared with long scales. The loss of items {{as a result of the}} analyses could potentially reduce this coverage. However, the content of the factors of both ER 5 FP and IGFP- 5 R preserved some of the core aspects of the five-factor model—as described in The 100 Revised Synonym Clusters list (Goldberg, 1992; Goldberg & Rosolack, 1994). Concerning the ER 5 FP, the Extraversion factor contains items related to Gregariousness, Shyness, <b>and</b> Reserve (<b>items</b> 1 <b>and</b> 6) and Expressiveness <b>and</b> Silence (<b>item</b> 5). The Conscientiousness items are associated with Persistence (e.g., <b>item</b> 2) <b>and</b> Decisiveness, Indecisiveness, <b>and</b> Inconsistency (<b>items</b> 10 <b>and</b> 12). The <b>items</b> of the Agreeableness factor are linked to Empathy <b>and</b> Overcriticalness (<b>item</b> 4) <b>and</b> Amiability, Callousness <b>and</b> Rudeness (<b>items</b> 7 <b>and</b> 14). The Neuroticism items are related to Placidity <b>and</b> Fear (<b>items</b> 3 <b>and</b> 18). The Openness items are associated to Creativity <b>and</b> Unimaginativeness (<b>item</b> 8) <b>and</b> Nonconformity (<b>item</b> 15).|$|R
5|$|Based on archaeological {{findings}} in the Middle East, in particular physical artifacts, textual references, inscriptions and wall paintings, it appears that Mycenaean Greeks achieved strong commercial and cultural interaction {{with most of the}} Bronze Age people living in this region: Canaanites, Kassites, Mitanni, Assyrians, and Egyptians. The 14th century Uluburun shipwreck, off the coast of southern Anatolia, displays the established trade routes that supplied the Mycenaeans with all the raw materials <b>and</b> <b>items</b> that the economy of Mycenaean Greece needed, such as copper and tin for the production of bronze products. A chief export of the Mycenaeans was olive oil, which was a multi-purpose product.|$|E
5|$|Conversations {{with the}} {{previous}} game's protagonists increased the Cadet's standing with them: if the player tapped a special button on-screen during timed sections of the conversation, the bond statistic with the chosen character would be increased. The relationships built up by the player triggered special character interactions during the final chapter. Agito featured sub-missions, the game's version of side-quests, some of which changed depending on the real-world day of the week. They were given by NPCs, and could range from crafting new spells and equipment to performing certain actions within a combat mission. Completing quests yielded rewards such as new equipment <b>and</b> <b>items.</b>|$|E
5|$|Currency is {{indirectly}} {{received from}} Ness' father, who can also save the game's progress. Each time the party wins a battle, Ness' father deposits money in an account {{that can be}} withdrawn at ATMs. In towns, players can visit various stores where weapons, armor, <b>and</b> <b>items</b> can be bought. Weapons and armor can be equipped to increase character strength and defense, respectively. In addition, items {{can be used for}} a number of purposes, such as healing. Towns also contain several other useful facilities such as hospitals where players can be healed for a fee.|$|E

5|$|Dan {{can visit}} merchants known as 'Spivs' to buy {{additional}} ammunition and services. He {{can also get}} advice from his ghost sidekick named Winston to learn new moves or to save the player's game between longer levels. Similar to the previous game, Dan's health is determined by a single health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It also depletes completely if he drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan completely runs out of health, the game restarts from the last known save point. Dan can refill his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which automatically refill his health if it is depleted. Whilst defeating enemies, Dan's Chalice of Souls will gradually fill up, which can then be collected and traded with Professor Kift to unlock new weapons <b>and</b> <b>items.</b>|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{uses the}} SCUMM engine {{developed}} for Maniac Mansion. LucasArts had gradually modified the engine since its creation. For example, {{the number of}} input verbs was reduced <b>and</b> <b>items</b> in the character's inventory are represented by icons rather than text. While implementing an animation, the designers encountered a problem later discovered to be limitation of the engine. Upon learning of the limitation, Gilbert reminisced about the file size of the first game. The staff then resolved to include it in the sequel.|$|E
5|$|During {{the month}} of {{separation}} from their parents and sister, Tatiana, Olga, Anastasia, and ladies in waiting busied themselves sewing precious stones and jewelry into their clothing, hoping to hide them from their captors, since Alexandra had written she, Nicholas and Maria had been heavily searched upon arrival in Ekaterinburg, <b>and</b> <b>items</b> confiscated. A letter from Demidova to Tegleva gave the {{instructions on how to}} deal with the 'medicines', a predetermined code name for the jewels. The concealments were successful, as the Bolsheviks were never aware of the jewels in the clothes until after the executions.|$|E
30|$|Across the two task types, <b>item</b> 4 (disldeorg) <b>and</b> <b>item</b> 8 (indpreldeorg) {{appeared}} to be the easiest items to students (Fig.  3); the former is a group discussion item while the latter an individual presentation item.

The remaining items 2 (disComstr), 5 (disProdel), and 1 (disProdel) {{appeared to}} be of medium difficulty level relatively. These results suggest some more fine-grained pattern of difference in item difficulty across the two SBA task types, which was not reported in previous studies.|$|R
