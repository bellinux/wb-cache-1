5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors {{that he was going to}} make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they had no idea of what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E

500|$|A Kanye West song in {{the episode}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is indeed a [...] "gay fish" [...] is a parody of the West song [...] "Heartless", from his 2008 {{recording}} 808s & Heartbreak and satirizes the rapper's usage of Auto-Tune pitch audio processing. When West first confronts Cartman and Jimmy, Cartman mistakes him for Puff Daddy, another rapper and record producer.|$|E

500|$|D'Ambrosio {{was delighted}} with the result, commenting: [...] "It was a great weekend for us overall. I think {{in the last four}} races we've had the pace to be on the podium but we didn't always manage to put it all {{together}} in the race. [...] This time we did it and it paid off!" [...] He however added regret <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and the team were unable to celebrate the win and a double podium at the respective ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Released {{in theaters}} in 1994, The Lion King marks Simba's first appearance. All {{the animals in}} the Pride Lands gather {{at the foot of}} Pride Rock to commemorate the birth of Simba, who will {{eventually}} succeed to the throne and take his father Mufasa's place as king. [...] Furious {{by the fact that he}} is no longer next in line, Simba's jealous uncle Scar refuses to attend the ceremony. [...] While Simba grows into a rambunctious lion cub who frequently boasts <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will someday rule over the Pride Lands, Scar secretly plots against him.|$|E
500|$|Having {{lost a lot}} {{of weight}} and unable to walk easily, he {{attended}} the Castro's 1988 Gay Freedom Parade in a wheelchair, being pushed along by Mckenna in front of the People with AIDS banner; along Market Street, assembled crowds shouted out his name as he passed. The subsequent 1988 Castro Street Fair was named [...] "A Tribute to Sylvester," [...] and although he was too ill to attend, crowds chanted his name {{to such an extent that}} he was able to hear them from his bedroom. He continued to give interviews to the media, being open <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was dying of AIDS, and sought in particular to highlight the impact that the disease was having in the African-American community. In an interview with the NME, he stated, [...] "I don't believe that AIDS is the wrath of God. People have a tendency to blame everything on God." ...|$|E

500|$|Weber {{was also}} {{influenced}} by Kantian ethics, which he nonetheless came {{to think of as}} obsolete in a modern age lacking in religious certainties. In this last respect, the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy is evident. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the [...] "deep tension between the Kantian moral imperatives and a Nietzschean diagnosis of the modern cultural world is apparently what gives such a darkly tragic and agnostic shade to Weber's ethical worldview". Another major influence in Weber's life was the writings of Karl Marx and the workings of socialist thought in academia and active politics. While Weber shares some of Marx's consternation with bureaucratic systems and maligns them as being capable of advancing their own logic to the detriment of human freedom and autonomy, Weber views conflict as perpetual and inevitable and does not host the spirit of a materially available utopia. Though the influence of his mother's Calvinist religiosity is evident throughout Weber's life and work, and though he maintained a deep, lifelong interest in the study of religions, Weber was open <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was personally irreligious.|$|E
500|$|The {{marriage}} {{was in the}} process of breaking down rapidly. Northrup and Hubbard had frequent rows and his violent behaviour towards her continued unabated. On one occasion, while Northrup was pregnant, Hubbard kicked her several times in the stomach in an apparent – though unsuccessful – attempt to induce an abortion. She recalled that [...] "with or without an argument, there'd be an upsurge of violence. The veins in his forehead would engorge" [...] and he would hit her [...] "out of the blue", breaking her eardrum in one attack. Despite this, she still [...] "felt so guilty <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was so psychologically damaged. I felt as though he had given so much to our country and I couldn't even bring him peace of mind. I believed thoroughly that he was a man of great honor, had sacrificed his well being to the country ... It just never occurred to me he was a liar." [...] He told her that he didn't want to be married [...] "for I can buy my friends whenever I want them" [...] but he could not divorce either, as the stigma would hurt his reputation. Instead, he said, if Northrup really loved him she should kill herself.|$|E

2500|$|Erdoğan harshly criticized Israel's {{conduct in}} Gaza at the World Economic Forum conference in Davos, Switzerland in January 2009. After the {{assembled}} audience applauded Peres, Erdoğan said: [...] "I {{find it very}} sad that people applaud what you said. You killed people. And I {{think that it is}} very wrong." [...] The moderator, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius asked Erdoğan to finish, saying that people needed to go to dinner. Erdoğan complained <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was given 12 minutes to talk, whereas Peres talked for a duration of 25 minutes. Erdoğan then proceeded to leave the stage.|$|E
2500|$|The crime {{had been}} unsolved {{for two years}} when, in October 2003, local media again covered the murder. Erickson {{reportedly}} had several dreams about the crime after seeing an article in a newspaper and, a few days later, mentioned the murder to Ferguson asking him if he thought {{he may have been}} involved. [...] "It was crazy that someone had been murdered a couple blocks away from where we had been partying". said Erickson. Ferguson reassured him that he was not involved in the crime. Over time, Erickson says, he began to think more and more about the murders and <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not remember that evening.|$|E
2500|$|The {{style is}} anecdotal, with many fun tales {{inserted}} into what {{might otherwise be}} sober history. For example, the reign of Frederick II is interrupted to tell an entirely fictional story of a nobleman named Friedrich von Antfurt. This Friedrich subjects a duchess to what we today could only call sexual harassment, {{to the point where}} she thinks up a ruse to get rid of him. She promises to give him what he wants (the poet makes no bones <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> only wants her body) provided he takes part in a joust wearing her chemise (underdress) instead of his armour. [...] She is of course counting on him being killed. But he survives, and {{there has to be a}} reckoning.|$|E

2500|$|The navy {{policy on}} {{insignia}} for Jewish chaplains was not resolved {{as quickly as}} it was in the army. When Rabbi David Goldberg entered the navy October 30, 1917, receiving orders after basic training to report to the , he asked a senior chaplain <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was told to wear the Latin cross, receiving the response that [...] "the men understood that he wore the insignia of the corps and not his faith group." [...] Goldberg wore the cross throughout the time he served on the ship, but after reporting to his next assignment ashore the combination of his shipboard experience and the number of letters he received from rabbinic colleagues objecting to his wearing a cross finally led to his petitioning the navy in 1918 to allow him to wear the Star of David instead.|$|E
60|$|This {{enforced}} stay, {{when he knew}} {{he was on his way}} home, {{had seemed}} almost unbearable to Lane. He felt that he had the strength to get home, and that was about all. He began to expectorate blood--no unusual thing for him--but this time to such extent that he feared the return of hemorrhage. The nights seemed sleepless, burning, black voids; and the days were hideous with noise and distraction. He wanted to think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was home--an astounding and unbelievable thing. Once he went down to the city and walked on Broadway and Fifth Avenue, taxing his endurance to the limit. But he had become used to pain and exhaustion. So long as he could keep up he did not mind.|$|E
