5|$|The use of Groundskeeper Willie (Scottish character) and {{the flag}} of the English army (Union Flag of Great Britain) <b>are</b> <b>obvious</b> inaccuracies, as England and Scotland were {{separate}} states and many Scottish fought with France during the Hundred Years' War.|$|E
5|$|Thor {{closely resembles}} other Indo-European deities {{associated}} with the thunder: the Celtic Taranis, the Baltic Perkūnas, the Slavic Perun, and particularly the Hindu Indra, whose red hair and thunderbolt weapon the vajra <b>are</b> <b>obvious</b> parallels. Scholars have compared Indra's slaying of Vritra with Thor's battle with Jörmungandr. Although in the past {{it was suggested that}} Thor was an indigenous sky god or a Viking Age import into Scandinavia, these Indo-European parallels make him generally accepted today as ultimately derived from a Proto-Indo-European deity.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} very similar to A.barbiger. There <b>are</b> <b>obvious</b> {{differences}} in typical leaf shape, with leaves of most populations of A.barbiger being very much longer and narrower than those of A.obovatus. However, leaf shape is variable in both species, and some southern populations of A.barbiger have leaves that are indistinguishable from those of A.obovatus. The most systematically important properties by which the two may be distinguished are the shape of the perianth limb, which is rounded in A.obovatus and pointed in A.barbiger; the bracts, glabrous versus hirsute; and the style-ends, which are green and scarlet respectively. The species also differ slightly in range of flower colours: A.barbiger has scarlet to bright red flowers, whereas A.obovatus flowers are scarlet to orange.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Cowper {{took the}} pages {{into his hand}} with a benevolent smile. At the first glance, however, his {{expression}} changed. It <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> that he <b>was</b> greatly interested. It <b>was</b> <b>obvious,</b> also, that he was correspondingly surprised.|$|R
5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>obvious</b> {{connections}} {{in the design of}} the Slaying of Holofernes and the Slaying of Haman at the opposite end of the chapel. Although in the Holofernes picture the figures are smaller and the space less filled, both have the triangular space divided into two zones by a vertical wall, allowing us to see what is happening on both sides of it. There are actually three scenes in the Haman picture because as well as seeing Haman punished, we see him at the table with Esther and the King and get a view of the King on his bed. Mordechai sits on the steps, making a link between the scenes.|$|E
5|$|A second {{hindrance}} to Sicilian architects' fully achieving {{their potential}} earlier was that frequently {{they were only}} rebuilding a damaged structure, {{and as a consequence}} having to match their designs to what had been before, or remained. The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica (Illustration 10) is an example. It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613, rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout, then damaged again in 1693. Rebuilding again began in 1702, by an unknown architect. Finally, Rosario Gagliardi oversaw the façade's completion in 1760, but the compromises he had to make in deference to the existing structure <b>are</b> <b>obvious.</b> While Gagliardi used the same formulae he used so successfully at the church of San Giorgio in Ragusa, here in Modica the building is heavier, and lacks his usual lightness of touch and freedom of design.|$|E

What matters is the objective reach of the claim. If the claim extends to what <b>is</b> <b>obvious,</b> it <b>is</b> invalid under §103. One {{of the ways in which}} a patent's subject matter can <b>be</b> proved <b>obvious</b> <b>is</b> by noting that there existed at the time of invention a known problem for which there <b>was</b> an <b>obvious</b> solution encompassed by the patent's claims.|$|R

25|$|Some of {{the signs}} of pain in babies <b>are</b> <b>obvious,</b> {{requiring}} no special equipment or training. The baby is crying and irritable when awake, develops a disturbed sleep pattern, feeds poorly, and shows a fearful, distrustful reaction towards care-givers.|$|E
25|$|Lack {{of human}} {{security}} has adverse consequences on economic growth, and therefore development. Some development costs <b>are</b> <b>obvious.</b> For example, in wars, people who join the army or flee {{can no longer}} work productively. Also, destroying infrastructure reduces the productive capacity of the economy.|$|E

25|$|However, there <b>are</b> <b>obvious</b> {{costs to}} group living as well. The larger the cluster, the more visible the cluster becomes {{and the more}} obvious it is to predators. While the nests do tend to blend in well with the {{surrounding}} environment, predators notice the nests, return repeatedly to the same clusters, and use them as a ready food source.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} cultural expressions born in Sicily during the Bronze Age the cultures of Castelluccio (Ancient Bronze Age) and of Thapsos (Middle Bronze Age) are worth noting. Both originated in the southeastern part of the island. In these cultures, in particular in the Castelluccio phase, there <b>are</b> <b>obvious</b> influences from the Aegean Sea, where the Helladic civilization was flourishing.|$|E
25|$|Stomata <b>are</b> <b>obvious</b> {{holes in}} the leaf by which, as was presumed for a while, {{pathogens}} can enter unchallenged. However, it has been recently shown that stomata do in fact sense the presence of some, if not all, pathogens. However, with the virulent bacteria applied to Arabidopsis plant leaves in the experiment, the bacteria released the chemical coronatine, which forced the stomata open again within a few hours.|$|E

25|$|Some of Mazzoni’s {{influences}} <b>are</b> <b>obvious,</b> such as Plato and Aristotle. Mazzoni regularly makes direct {{reference to}} their works and draws {{some of his}} ideas directly from theories that they established (the distinction between icastic and phantastic imitation, for example, is drawn from Plato). The influence of other thinkers has also been identified in Mazzoni’s work, including neo-platonists such as Proclus and Greek sophists such as Dionysius of Helicarnassus and Aulus Gellius (the latter two particularly in Mazzoni's discussion {{on the impact of}} the character of the poet {{on the nature of the}} poem;).|$|E
25|$|Since the 19th century, {{art historians}} have debated which {{passages}} {{are attributable to}} the little-known and obscure Hubert and which are by Jan, famous across Europe by the early 1430s. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it was often assumed that Jan had found a number of random panels left behind after Hubert's death and assembled them into the current format. This view has been discounted since the early 19th century, {{on the basis of}} the obvious overall design of the work, although there <b>are</b> <b>obvious</b> stylistic differences between many passages.|$|E
25|$|Patent {{prints are}} chance {{friction}} ridge impressions which <b>are</b> <b>obvious</b> {{to the human}} eye and which {{have been caused by}} the transfer of foreign material from a finger onto a surface. Some obvious examples would be impressions from flour and wet clay. Because they are already visible and have no need of enhancement they are generally photographed rather than being lifted in the way that latent prints are. An attempt to preserve the actual print is always made for later presentation in court, and there are many techniques used to do this. Patent prints can be left on a surface by materials such as ink, dirt, or blood.|$|E

25|$|By the 15th {{century the}} scene was often {{prominent}} in large polyptych altarpieces with many scenes in Northern Europe, and began {{to be the main}} scene on the central panel in some cases, usually when commissioned by lay confraternities dedicated to the Holy Name of Jesus, which were found in many cities. These often included donor portraits of members, though none <b>are</b> <b>obvious</b> in Luca Signorelli's Circumcision of Christ commissioned by the confraternity at Volterra. The devotion to the Holy Name was a strong feature of the theatrical and extremely popular preaching of Saint Bernardino of Siena, who adopted Christ's IHS monogram as his personal emblem, which was also used by the Jesuits; this often appears in paintings, as may a scroll held by an angel reading Vocatum est nomen eius Jesum.|$|E
25|$|In this {{approach}} the so-called earlier 'rhythmic' manuscripts of unheightened neumes that carry {{a wealth of}} melo-rhythmic information but not of exact pitches, are compared in large tables of comparison with relevant later 'melodic' manuscripts' that are written on lines or use double alphabetic and neumes notation over the text, but as a rule have less rhythmic refinement compared to the earlier group. However, the comparison {{between the two groups}} has made it possible to correct what <b>are</b> <b>obvious</b> mistakes. In other instances it is not so easy to find a consensus. In 1984 Chris Hakkennes published his own transcription of the Graduale Triplex. He devised a new graphic adaptation of square notation 'simplex' in which he integrated the rhythmic indications of the two most relevant sources, that of Laon and Skt. Gallen.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{uncontrolled}} public {{decisions have}} led to poor outcomes and disrespect for the decision-makers. Such decisions also lacked the regularity and transparency that distinguish them from the mere say-so of public authorities. On such grounds, there <b>are</b> <b>obvious</b> benefits for the disclosure of reasons for decisions. First, procedural participation by people affected by a decision promotes {{the rule of law}} by making it more difficult for the public authority to act arbitrarily. Requiring the giving of reasons helps ensure that decisions are carefully thought through, which in turn aids in the control of administrative discretion. Secondly, accountability makes it necessary for the public authority {{to face up to the}} people affected by a decision. When a public authority acts on all the relevant considerations, this increases the probability of better decision outcomes and, as such, is beneficial to public interests. Another important benefit is that respect for decision-makers is fostered, which increases their integrity in the public's eyes.|$|E
