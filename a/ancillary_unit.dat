5000|$|The {{role of a}} {{bodyguard}} depends on several factors. First, {{it depends on the}} role of a given bodyguard in a close protection team. A bodyguard can be a driver-bodyguard, a close-protection officer (who escorts the client), or part of an <b>ancillary</b> <b>unit</b> that provides support such as IED detection, electronic [...] "bug" [...] detection, counter-sniper monitoring, pre-searches facilities, and background-checks people who will have contact with the client. Second, the role of {{a bodyguard}} depends on the level of risk that the client faces. A bodyguard protecting a client at high risk of assassination will be focusing on very different roles (e.g., checking cars for IED devices, bombs, watching for potential shooters, etc.) than a bodyguard escorting a celebrity who is being stalked by aggressive tabloid photographers (e.g., the role will be to ask the photographers to maintain their distance and block the path of aggressive cameramen). Some bodyguards specialize in the close quarter protection of children of VIPs, to protect them from kidnapping or assassination.|$|E

40|$|A {{technical}} {{analysis was performed}} for a new process that produces ethanol and acetic acid from hardwood in addition to bleached hardwood Kraft pulp. The new process, termed the "near neutral " hemicellulose extraction process, involves the extraction of wood hemicellulose using green liquor prior to conventional Kraft pulping. This thesis assumes that the new process is located at an existing kraft pulp mill. <b>Ancillary</b> <b>unit</b> operations in the process include hydrolysis of the extracted carbohydrates using sulfuric acid, filtration of the extract to remove lignin that was extracted with the carbohydrates, liquid-liquid extraction of acetic acid and by-product furfural, liming of the hydrolyzed extract, separation of gypsum which {{is the product of}} the liming reaction, fermentation of C 5 and C 6 sugars and upgrading of the acetic acid and ethanol products by distillation. After the extraction step in the process, the final pH of the extraction liquor varies between 5 and 6 and preserves the yield and physical properties of the final pulp product which are equivalent to market Kraft pulp. In the thesis reported here, a design model was developed using WinGEMS and ASPEN Plus software. The integrated mass and energy balances were obtained from thecomputer model and used to size important process equipment in the process...|$|E
40|$|AbstractErgonomics {{continues}} to be relevant in work-places in which {{a significant amount of}} manual labor exists, such as in some of the Cellular manufacturing Systems (CMS). In order to distribute the workload evenly over all the workers in the line, some of the industries resorted to the practice of rotating all the workers through all workstations in the cell (Nagare cell) that prevents monotony and boredom. The presence of automated equipment in the cell will hamper this strategy for job rotation. This study aims to demonstrate the application of ergonomically designed looping layout in the assembly cell in the labor demanded lean manufacturing environment. The study was conducted in a process line in an automobile <b>ancillary</b> <b>unit.</b> The current process line which was conventional U-shaped line was simulated and the productivity has been verified and validated with the real life environment. Process map showed that the operators walked long distances, felt stress in certain workstations and that inventory piled up at the bottleneck workstation. We identify sub-cells within the cell. With the same manpower, we develop a new layout (Suzhal) and make workers rotate within each sub-cell. The proposed layout was simulated and results have been compared with the current layout. The analysis shows a reduction in the total operating cycle time, higher alertness among operators, better distribution of workloads in the group and hence higher productivity...|$|E
40|$|The “near neutral {{hemicellulose}} extraction process” involves {{extraction of}} hemicellulose using green liquor prior to kraft pulping. <b>Ancillary</b> <b>unit</b> operations include hydrolysis of the extracted carbohydrates using sulfuric acid, removal of extracted lignin, liquid-liquid extraction of acetic acid, liming followed by separation of gypsum, fermentation of C 5 and C 6 sugars, and upgrading the acetic acid and ethanol products by distillation. The process described {{here is a}} variant of the “near neutral hemicellulose extraction process” that uses the minimal amount of green liquor to maximize sugar production while still maintaining the strength quality of the final kraft pulp. Production rates vary between 2. 4 to 6. 6 million gallons per year of acetic acid and 1. 0 and 5. 6 million gallons per year of ethanol, depending upon the pulp production rate. The discounted cash flow rate of return for the process is a strong function of plant size, and the capital investment depends on the complexity of the process. For a 1, 000 ton per day pulp mill, the production cost for ethanol was estimated to vary between $ 1. 63 and $ 2. 07 /gallon, and for acetic acid between $ 1. 98 and $ 2. 75 per gallon depending upon the capital equipment requirements for the new process. To make the process economically attractive, for smaller mill sizes the processing must be simplified to facilitate reductions in capital cost...|$|E

40|$|Asbestos {{possesses}} {{properties that}} are ideally {{suitable for use}} as a friction material in automotive {{and a number of other}} applications. Animal and human studies carried out since the early 1900 s have established that asbestos is carcinogenic and that exposure to especially asbestos dust causes a large number of diseases. The search is, therefore, still on to find suitable substitutes for asbestos. A brake lining containing 14 ingredients was investigated to study the effect of ingredients on various aspects of friction properties. The composite was developed for a nonasbestos organic based friction material for an automotive brake system and contained typical ingredients for commercial brake friction materials. Two types of friction materials with different combinations were developed: (1) flyash range (10 %- 60 %), and (2) without flyash based friction materials were investigated to study the effect of ingredients on the friction characteristics and wear. The main focus on the average normal coefficient, hot coefficient (Fade and recovery), wear loss, mechanical, as the function of the relative amount of the ingredient. The results also showed that the friction coefficient of fly-ash was better in the range of 0. 35 to 0. 48 when compared barites based brake linings and asbestos based brake linings. The materials such as potassium titanate (terraces), wollastonite, friction dust powder have strongly influence on friction coefficient. Wear resistance of the friction material was strongly affected by the relative amounts of ceramic wool, rockwool, calcium hydroxide, and zircon. The presence of glass fiber, twaron fiber, has increased the strength of the friction material. All these samples were tested on chase type friction tester at automobile <b>ancillary</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E

In this multi-agent system, the patient agents compete over the scarce hospital resources. Moreover to improve the overall solution, the agents then negotiate with one another. To this end, a market mechanism is described, in which each self interested agent tries to improve its own situation. In particular we focus on how the agents can calculate demand and supply prices based upon their current schedule. Further, an evaluation of first results of the proposed method is given...|$|R
