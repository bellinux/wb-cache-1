2500|$|The term [...] "directional sign" [...] covers both <b>Advance</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Signs</b> (ADS), {{placed on}} the {{approach}} to a junction, and <b>Direction</b> <b>Signs</b> (DS) at the junction itself, showing where to turn. A DS has a chevron (pointed) end, and this type is {{also referred to as}} a flag-type sign.|$|R
25|$|On <b>Advance</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>Signs,</b> as {{introduced}} {{under the}} Guildford Rules, the background colour indicates {{the category of}} route on which it is located. On all directional signs, destination names are placed on the colour appropriate to the category of route used from that junction. A panel of one colour on a different colour of background therefore indicates a change of route status. A smaller area of colour, called a patch, surrounds a bracketed route number (but not its associated destination) to indicate a higher status route that is joined some distance away. A patch may only be coloured blue or green.|$|R

50|$|<b>Direction</b> <b>signs</b> {{inform about}} places, businesses, routes, choice of lanes, choice of roads and {{distance}} to destinations. <b>Direction</b> <b>signs</b> {{with a yellow}} background (blue on motorways) show geographical destinations. <b>Direction</b> <b>signs</b> with a white background (or white fields on yellow and blue signs) show local destinations. <b>Direction</b> <b>signs</b> with a brown background show destinations of special interest to tourism. Orange backgrounds denote temporary detours.|$|R
50|$|<b>Direction</b> and {{distance}} <b>signs</b> are rectangular with dark green backgrounds and white text. In urban areas, <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> have dark blue backgrounds. The signs are normally written in Korean and English. In March 2010, Korea Expressway Corporation {{introduced a new}} type of <b>direction</b> <b>sign</b> for expressways. Currently, Korea Expressway Corporation changes old <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> to new ones on their expressways. This new type of <b>direction</b> <b>sign</b> is exit guide based sign and its typeface has changed from Sandol Doropyojipanche (Sandol traffic sign typeface, which can be seen on the distance <b>sign</b> and <b>direction</b> <b>sign</b> below) to Hangilche (Hangil typeface).|$|R
5000|$|The Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals {{divides the}} direction, position, or {{indication}} <b>sign</b> category into <b>direction</b> <b>signs,</b> which are only those giving distances or directions {{to a given}} location; road identification signs (also known as [...] "reassurance signs"), which repeat the name or number of the road, and place identification signs, which give {{the name of a}} landmark, such as a town, river or border. Unlike the other classes of <b>sign,</b> <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> remain broadly undefined by the convention; the only restrictions given are that <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> must be either a rectangle or an arrow shaped pentagon, and that they may not contain placenames in more than two languages. Additionally, <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> on motorways must be blue or green, while temporary <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> are yellow or orange.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study evaluates ex-ante {{which of}} two signalization {{concepts}} {{is most effective}} at a reorganized arterial road in Hasselt (Flanders; Belgium) : a gantry (<b>advance</b> <b>direction</b> <b>sign</b> above the road) or a cantilever (<b>advance</b> <b>direction</b> <b>sign</b> alongside the road). Over a distance of 500 meters, three intersections {{will be replaced by}} five intersections with traffic lights and the number of sorting lanes will be increased. The complexity of the situation poses a challenge as to how most optimally signalize route guidance. Twenty-two participants drove seven different routes in a medium fidelity fixed-base simulator with a mock-up in front of a single projection screen. Participants were exposed to an animated graphic road environment that integrated a full HD video recording of the actual real life road environment and a virtually developed scenery. The video contained 3 D animations of the foreseen geometric road realignments. We used a within-subject design with origin, destination, and signalization concept (gantry vs. cantilever) as the manipulated conditions in a randomized order. Participants were able to control the rendering of the video simulation by means of the gas pedal, mimicking speed. The direction indicator was used to signal lane switches and route-related decisions at a number of predefined locations. In addition, we recorded eye tracking data by means of a combined FaceLab-EyeWorks system. For each drive, we instructed participants to head for one of the destinations. In the analysis, reaching the destination (outcome of a decision) was less important as the performance at a decision point (optimal or suboptimal). Performance was measured in terms of capacity gains (correct car in the correct lane) and less weaving behavior (as a surrogate of traffic safety). At the end of the experiment the participants completed a short questionnaire. Test scenarios with gantries resulted in more optimal decisions compared to scenarios with cantilevers and participants needed less attempts to reach the correct destination. Compared to the cantilevers, participants had more but equally long eye fixations on the gantries, resulting in a higher total fixation duration time for the latter. The questionnaire showed that 73 % of the participants preferred the gantries over the cantilevers. Based on the simulator study gantries can be considered as more effective in terms of route guidance than cantilevers because they induce the lowest number of maneuvers. Consequently, the recommendation was to equip the reorganized arterial with gantries...|$|E
