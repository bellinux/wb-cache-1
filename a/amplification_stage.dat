25|$|The first {{documented}} photomultiplier demonstration {{dates to}} the early 1934 accomplishments of an RCA group based in Harrison, NJ.

These accomplishments were finalized prior to June 1934 as detailed in the manuscript submitted to Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers (Proc. IRE). The device consisted of a semi-cylindrical photocathode, a secondary emitter mounted on the axis, and a collector grid surrounding the secondary emitter. The tube had a gain of about eight and operated at frequencies well above 10kHz.|$|E
2500|$|Figure 2 shows a more {{complicated}} grating configuration that involves focusing elements, here depicted as lenses. The lenses are {{placed at a distance}} [...] from each other (they act as a 1:1 telescope), and at a distance [...] from the gratings. If , the setup acts as a positive-dispersion stretcher and if , it is a negative-dispersion stretcher. And the case [...] is used in the pulse shaper. Usually, the focusing element is a spherical or cylindrical mirror rather than a lens. As with the configuration in Figure 1, it is possible to use an additional mirror and use a single grating rather than two separate ones. This setup requires that the beam diameter is very small compared to the length of the telescope; otherwise undesirable aberrations will be introduced. For this reason, it is normally used as a stretcher before the <b>amplification</b> <b>stage,</b> since the low-intensity seed pulses can be collimated to a beam with a small diameter.|$|E

Different technological routes to generate such multimillijoule sub-optical-cycle waveforms are currently pursued, opening up unprecedented opportunities in attoscience and strong-field physics.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{and with the}} advent of the Compact Disc, PS was one of the first American {{high-end}} audio manufacturers to modify one of the few CD players of the day by replacing its internal audio <b>amplification</b> <b>stage</b> following the internal D to A player. The first and only modified CD player introduced by the company was the CD-1 based on the Philips Magnavox line of CD players. The company engineers chose the Magnavox unit because the belief at the time was it sounded better to its only rival in the marketplace, the Sony. Inside the CD 1 PS engineers added a discrete high voltage line stage and power supply, replacing the NE 5532 op amps used as the output <b>amplification</b> <b>stage</b> of the Magnavox. This unit was a stopgap product designed to get the company [...] "in the game" [...] of this new format that would someday challenge vinyl, the company's core products addressed. In the background, PS engineers were working to figure out a way to utilize the CD player's digital output and create a standalone D to A converter. In late 1982, the company succeeded in releasing the first high-end standalone D to A converter known as the Digital Link. Other manufacturers such as Arcam and Theta were also on the same path and both companies released competing D to A processors within several months of the Digital Link's introduction. From this point onwards, the company has produced a succession of DACS with the same goal in mind - that of supplanting the built in DAC and line stage of CD players. Later advances in CD technology led the high-end audio industry to release a new category of product called a CD Transport that contained no DAC and meant to use as a pair which became known as a DAC and Transport combination.|$|E

Only one detector per channel of digitization was used; normally two are required for in-phase and quadrature signals, but our use of high sampling rates (comparable to the radio frequency) and deconvolution procedures means that the in-phase and quadrature components could be generated in software after digitization on a single channel (Hocking et al. 2014). Each detector consisted of just 4 <b>amplification</b> <b>stages</b> and one filtering circuit. No mixing or beating took place in hardware, minimizing addition of extra electronic noise and artificial frequency content.|$|R
