40|$|Remotely sensed {{data were}} {{collected}} using an <b>airborne</b> Daedalus <b>thematic</b> <b>mapper,</b> flown at 4000 m, over Swansea Bay, northern Bristol Channel, U. K. The area is one of high tidal range and wave activity. Fifty-eight surface-water/sediment samples were collected from three vessels as concurrent ‘sea-truth’ data. Samples were analysed for suspended sediment concentration (SSC) Regression equations are developed for SSC using data in the 450 - 520 nm (channel 2), 520 - 600 nm (channel 3), 605 - 625 nm (channel 4) and 630 - 690 nm (channel 5) spectral bands Localized flow patterns are visible in the imagery and are identified using suspended material as the passive tracer.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{demonstrate}} the utility of remote sensing systems to monitor sites of suspected acid rain deposition damage, intensive field activities, coupled with aircraft overflights, were centered on red spruce stands in Vermont during August and September of 1984. Remote sensing data were acquired using the <b>Airborne</b> Imaging Spectrometer, <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> Simulator, Barnes Model 12 to 1000 Modular Multiband Radiometer and Spectron Engineering Spectrometer (the former two flown on the NASA C- 130; the latter two on A Bell UH- 1 B Iroquois Helicopter). Field spectral data were acquired during the week of the August overflights using a high spectral resolution spectrometer and two broad-band radiometers. Preliminary analyses of these data indicate a number of spectral differences in vegetation between high and low damage sites.

40|$|The <b>thematic</b> <b>mapper</b> is a {{multispectral}} scanner {{which will be}} launched aboard Landsat-D in the early 1980 s. Compared with previous Landsat scanners, this instrument will have an improved spatial resolution (30 m) and new spectral bands.

40|$|Intertidal {{sediment}} {{distribution is}} an important factor in the understanding of estuarine ecological, morphological and pollution processes. Airborne remote sensing is identified as a cost-effective tool that may be used to provide accurate synoptic maps of estuarine sediment distributions. However, prior to the collection and analysis of airborne imagery, spectral characterization of intertidal sediments is fundamental. Through a series of in situ and laboratory reflectance (0. 35 [...] 2. 5 mm) experiments the spectral complexity of the Ribble Estuary, UK, intertidal sediments has been investigated. Positive relationships between Daedalus <b>Airborne</b> <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> band 9 and band 10 simulated reflectance and percentage sand of intertidal sediments have been identified in the field (r 2 5 0. 51 and r 2 5 0. 61) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{reflectance}} {{ratio of the}} middle-infrared band (MIR) to the near-infrared band (NIR) is linearly related to the log(10) equivalent water thickness (EWT) for single leaves of different morphologies, whereas the MIR/NIR radiance ratio is correlated with the leaf area index (LAI). The hypothesis that the MIR/NIR ratio measures canopy EWT was tested by reanalyzing <b>airborne</b> <b>Thematic</b> <b>Mapper</b> Simulator and field data obtained across a large gradient of LAI in western Oregon, U. S. A. The measured airborne MIR/NIR {{reflectance ratio}}s for canopies {{were not significantly different}} from the predicted ratios using leaf data for canopy EWT, except for two desert woodland sites.

A quantitative measure of proportion estimation variance (Fisher information) was used to evaluate the corn/soybeans separability for each TM band as a function of time during the growing season. The additional bands in the middle infrared allowed corn and soybeans to be separated much earlier than was possible with the visible and near-infrared bands alone.
