6000|$|... "But <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> now {{to bring}} you one in person? I have thought so much of seeing you again! Will you not say a word of welcome to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Caroline; <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> in supposing {{that now}} at least you must know your own feelings? Or shall I tell you again how dearly, how truly I love you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What have I {{done but}} love him? What could I wish {{but to make}} him happy? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> rich enough, praised, and petted;.... and then he came,.... glorious as he is, like a god among men--among apes rather--and <b>I</b> worshipped him: <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> in that? <b>I</b> gave up all for him: <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> in that? <b>I</b> gave him myself: what could I do more? He condescended to like me--he the hero! Could I help submitting? I loved him: could I help loving him? Did <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> him in that? Cruel, cruel Wulf!....' ...|$|R
25|$|I {{know that}} things that <b>I</b> don't think <b>are</b> {{necessarily}} racist... could <b>be...</b> And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sincerely {{sorry for the}} pain and hurt I've caused to Shilpa's family. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wrong...</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wrong</b> and <b>I</b> know that my words and my actions were wrong and I'm not trying to justify {{that in any way}} â€“ <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wrong,</b> and the people who have complained are not wrong. They're just insulted by me and I completely take that criticism.|$|R
5000|$|According to Joel, George Martin {{wrote him}} a letter and it read, [...] "You <b>were</b> right; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> <b>I</b> should have {{considered}} working with your band. Congratulations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you read}} her letter, Teresa? <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> in {{feeling that this}} poor wounded heart has surely some claim on me? If I am wrong, oh, what am I to do? what am I to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Do {{you think}} it was wrong to make eternity feminine? I knew that the Greek word was not feminine; but {{imagined}} that the English personification should be so. <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> in this? Will you consider the subject again? ...|$|E
6000|$|What are the {{objections}} to the divorced husband and wife becoming husband and wife again? Mrs. Presty has stated them in the following order. <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> in assuming that, on this occasion at least, you will agree with Mrs. Presty? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Andrew," [...] she whispered, [...] "I have <b>been</b> ashamed. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> That night--the {{thought of}} my pettiness--my foolish, selfish fears.--Oh, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong!</b> <b>I</b> have prayed that the time might come when I could tell you. And if you hadn't come, I never could have told you. I couldn't have written. I couldn't have come to London. But I wanted you to know." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mirabel shuddered. [...] "I am {{surrounded}} by dangers, whichever way I look," [...] he said. [...] "Do what I may, {{it turns out}} to <b>be</b> <b>wrong.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> perhaps, when <b>I</b> brought Emily here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me for {{speaking}} so hastily {{to you this}} morning. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> <b>I</b> fear I hurt you and made the day more burdensome." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ah, yet would I--and would I might! [...] So {{much your}} eyes my fancy take-- [...] Be still {{the first to}} leap to light [...] That I might kiss those eyes awake! [...] For, am I right or <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong,</b> [...] To choose your own you did not care; [...] You'd have 'my' moral from the song, [...] And I will take my {{pleasure}} there: [...] And, am I right or <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong,</b> [...] My fancy, ranging thro' and thro', [...] To search a meaning for the song, [...] Perforce will still revert to you; [...] Nor finds a closer truth than this [...] All-graceful head, so richly curl'd, [...] And evermore a costly kiss [...] The prelude to some brighter world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Comrade Asher," [...] he said, [...] "this {{is indeed}} a Moment of Mirth. I have been {{wondering}} for weeks where you could have got to. And Comrade Philpotts! <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> in {{saying that this is}} the maddest, merriest day of all the glad New Year?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{can only}} answer me in that tone I will make an end of it at once. When I told you of my engagement, I told you also that another woman possessed my heart. <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> to suppose that you knew to whom I alluded?" ...|$|E
60|$|Nor <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong.</b> At {{the bottom}} of the runway, or rather at the landing on the floor below, I saw that the shaft descended into the pits beneath, and as I glanced down the {{flickering}} light of a torch revealed the presence of the three <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trailing.|$|R
5000|$|While {{on a trip}} to India, Jade apologised for her behaviour. She {{admitted}} that her comments to Shilpa could be seen as racist. In a video posted on the News of the World's website, Jade tearfully said:I know that things that <b>I</b> don't think <b>are</b> necessarily racist ... could <b>be.</b> ... And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sincerely sorry for the pain and hurt I've caused to Shilpa's family. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wrong</b> ... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wrong</b> and <b>I</b> know that my words and my actions were wrong and I'm not trying to justify that in any way - <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wrong,</b> and the people who have complained are not wrong. They're just insulted by me and I completely take that criticism.|$|R
6000|$|... "Since no no [both nos in original] one {{can prove}} that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure to be right;" [...] and thus he {{maintained}} his reputation for wisdom.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What do I deduce from this?' Mrs. Micawber {{went on to}} say, {{still with}} the same air of putting a case lucidly. 'What is the conclusion, my dear Mr. Copperfield, to which I am irresistibly brought? <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> in saying, {{it is clear that}} we must live?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And who {{put it into}} Taylor's {{heart to}} help us?" [...] asked Paul. [...] "He {{is one of the}} worst men of our crew, so we can hardly say it was his own tenderness, and {{certainly}} it was not the devil who moved him to it. <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> in holding that it was `Our Father'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Too late didst thou say, oh Taurus Antinor?" [...] said Dea Flavia {{raising her}} pencilled eyebrows {{with a slight}} {{expression}} of scorn, [...] "nay! I {{had not seen the}} hammer descend! The girl until then is not sold, and open to the highest bidder. Or <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong,</b> O praefect, in thus interpreting the laws of Rome?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He stood {{flushed and}} scared before her. [...] "I--I <b>am</b> sorry. <b>I</b> didn't mean--I hoped---- But it <b>is</b> all right---- <b>I</b> mean you <b>are</b> right, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wrong.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not less}} so now," [...] she replied, very feelingly; [...] "but indeed I cannot go. If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wrong,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing what <b>I</b> believe to <b>be</b> right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, how did my {{calculations}} {{come out}} under these circumstances? When I calculated that this impetuous young woman would overdo {{it in new}} directions, <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> or right? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> right. What does she try to do? Don't let it give you a turn? To throw the murder on her ladyship." ...|$|R
6000|$|The tone of {{indifference}} {{in which he}} expressed his gratitude piqued Francine. She resented it by drawing her own conclusion from {{what he had said}} of the ladies and the musk deer. [...] "I was wrong in admiring your drawing," [...] she remarked; [...] "and wrong again in thinking you a strange man. <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong,</b> for the third time, in believing that you dislike women?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Wordsworth has deputed {{to me the}} {{acceptable}} office of answering your friendly letter, which has followed us to Brigham, upon {{the banks of the}} river Derwent, near Cockermouth, the birthplace of four brothers and their sister. Of these four, I, the second, am now the only one left. <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> in supposing that you have been here? The house was driven out of its place by a railway, and stands now nothing like so advantageously for a prospect of this beautiful country, though at only a small distance from its former situation.|$|E
6000|$|... "My pledge is redeemed--the {{facts are}} before you. <b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> in taking my gloomy {{view of the}} prospect? I cannot forget that this unhappy man was once my friend, and I really see no hope {{for him in the}} future. Deliberately self-exposed to the {{violence}} of ruffians and the outbreak of disease, who is to extricate him from his shocking position? The one person who can do it is the person whose association with him would be his ruin--Mercy Merrick. Heaven only knows what disasters it may be my painful duty to communicate to you in my next letter! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{presumed that}} my watchful {{guardian}} was Sola, nor <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong.</b> This girl alone, {{among all the}} green Martians with whom I came in contact, disclosed characteristics of sympathy, kindliness, and affection; her ministrations to my bodily wants were unfailing, and her solicitous care saved me from much suffering and many hardships.|$|R
60|$|Ordinarily <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not given}} to long speeches, nor ever before had I descended to bombast, but I had guessed at the keynote which would strike an {{answering}} chord in the breasts of the green Martians, nor <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong,</b> for my harangue evidently deeply impressed them, and their attitude toward me thereafter was still further respectful.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> rude or hasty in {{refusing to}} hear you, Mr. Libby, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very <b>wrong.</b> <b>I</b> must hear {{anything}} {{you have to}} say." ...|$|R
60|$|Did {{you ever}} read Bulwer's 'Eva, or the Unhappy Marriage'? That {{is a sort}} of poetical novel, with modern manners inclusive. But Bulwer, {{although}} a poet in prose, writes all his rhythmetical compositions somewhat prosaically, providing an instance of that curious difference which exists between the poetical writer and the poet. It is easier to give the instance than the reason, but I suppose the cause of the rhythmetical impotence must lie somewhere in the want of the power of concentration. For is it not true that the most prolix poet is capable of briefer expression than the least prolix prose writer, or <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong?...</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Where <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong,</b> Kitty?" [...] said Dorothea, quite meekly. She {{was almost}} ready now to think Celia wiser than herself, and was really {{wondering}} with some fear what her wrong notion was. Celia felt her advantage, and {{was determined to}} use it. None of them knew Dodo {{as well as she}} did, or knew how to manage her. Since Celia's baby was born, she had had a new sense of her mental solidity and calm wisdom. It seemed clear that where there was a baby, things were right enough, and that error, in general, was a mere lack of that central poising force.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know well}} that you speak {{what is not}} true," [...] she said. [...] "You and your Frenchmen strove to burn us out of Middle Marsh; my brother John struck Hugh de Cressi {{as though he were}} a dog and used words toward him that no knave would bear, let alone one better born than we are. Moreover, {{afterward}} once he spared his life, and Grey Dick, standing alone against a crowd, did but use his skill to save us. Is it murder, then to protect our honour and to save ourselves from death? And <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> to refuse to marry a fine French knave when I chance to love an honest man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes! I told George Sampson, as George Sampson tells you, said Miss Lavvy, 'that those hateful Boffins {{would pick}} a quarrel with Bella, {{as soon as}} her novelty had worn off. Have they done it, or have they not? Was <b>I</b> right, or <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrong?</b> And {{what do you say}} to us, Bella, of your Boffins now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That face {{looks very}} mischievous," [...] thought Pandora. [...] "I wonder whether it smiles because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing <b>wrong!</b> <b>I</b> have the {{greatest}} mind {{in the world to}} run away!" ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> may <b>be</b> <b>wrong,</b> <b>I</b> may <b>be</b> right.|$|R
