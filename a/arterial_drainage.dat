40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} pedicle occlusion on the viable area of a skin island flap. METHODS: An epigastric skin island flap was performed in 160 Wistar rats. The animals were randomly divided into four groups: G- 1 : occlusion of inferior epigastric artery; G- 2 : inferior epigastric vein; G- 3 : inferior epigastric vessels (artery/vein). At varying times postoperatively (2, 3, 4, 5 th day), animals from each group were randomly selected, and the pedicle was occluded. On the 10 th. postop. day, the skin flaps were evaluated by templates to determine the percentage of surviving skin. The computer HP&# 8482; 9830 A captured the photographs and the mean flap necrosis area was assessed. RESULTS: An increasing area of flap survived with less area of necrosis with increased time of days intervals. In the G- 1, the mean area of necrosis observed (two to five days) were 95. 2, 60. 8, 31 and 3. 7 % respectively. In the G- 2 were 95. 5, 57. 6, 19. 5 and 5. 6 % respectively. In the G- 3, a 100, 80, 32. 4 and 14. 9 % of mean area was observed.

40|$|Only {{primates}} have temporal lobes, {{which are}} largest in man, accommodating 17 % of the cerebral cortex and including areas with auditory, olfactory, vestibular, visual and linguistic functions. The hippocampal formation, on the medial {{side of the}} lobe, includes the parahippocampal gyrus, subiculum, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and associated white matter, notably the fimbria, whose fibres continue into the fornix. The hippocampus is an inrolled gyrus that bulges into the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. Association fibres connect {{all parts of the}} cerebral cortex with the parahippocampal gyrus and subiculum, which in turn project to the dentate gyrus. The largest efferent projection of the subiculum and hippocampus is through the fornix to the hypothalamus. The choroid fissure, alongside the fimbria, separates the temporal lobe from the optic tract, hypothalamus and midbrain. The amygdala comprises several nuclei on the medial aspect of the temporal lobe, mostly anterior the hippocampus and indenting the tip of the temporal horn. The amygdala receives input from the olfactory bulb and from association cortex for other modalities of sensation. Its major projections are to the septal area and prefrontal cortex, mediating emotional responses to sensory stimuli.

50|$|Harness {{was next}} {{called upon to}} reform the Royal Mint. The master of the mint in 1850, was a {{political}} officer whose responsibilities were limited to his parliamentary duties, and when Harness was made deputy-master he virtually became {{the head of the}} establishment. The mechanical operations of coining were, at that time, a matter of contract between the deputy-master and certain melters, assayers, and moneyers, who, besides enjoying considerable emoluments, also claimed a vested interest in the appointment of their successors. Harness substituted a government department for this system. During the progress of these reforms, the master, Richard Lalor Sheil, was appointed British minister at Florence. Sir John Herschel succeeded him, with no parliamentary responsibility. On the completion of the reorganisation in 1852, Herschel said that but for the resource and energy of Harness he could not have carried out the reforms so efficiently. Before Herschel's appointment, Harness had been promised the mastership when the proposed abolition of a political head took place. He therefore considered himself superseded and resigned the position of deputy-master, although Lord Aberdeen, then prime minister, personally pressed him to remain. After declining an offer from the Government of New Zealand, he accepted the appointment of commissioner of public works in Ireland, and remained there for two years.

40|$|Each {{normally}} implanted embryo is {{preceded by}} the successful transfer of spermatozoa and ova to the ampulla of the Fallopian tube, fertilisation, and subsequent delivery of fertilised ova to the uterus after a suitable period of time. Any malfunction in the mechanisms controlling these processes can seriously {{interfere with the}} ability of an individual, or species, to reproduce. It is therefore necessary to gain a closer understanding of the physiological mechanisms controlling these events. The review presented in this chapter outlines present knowledge on the mechanics, and time relationships, of normal entry and passage of gametes through the Fallopian tube. B. ANATOMY OF THE FALLOPAIN TUBE 1. Morphology The Fallopian tubes are bilaterally placed, each being suspended by a mesenteric peritoneal fold, the mesosalpinx. The following regions of each Fallopian tube are easily recognised (Piliero, Jacobs & Wischnitzer, 1965) : 1. The funnel shaped infundibulum containing a fimbriated opening, the abdominal ostium, projecting towards and in contiguity with the ovary. 2. An intermediate dilated portion, the ampulla. 3. The isthmus, a constricted and convoluted segment, providing continuity between its uterine orifice, the utero-tubal junction, and the ampulla. The vascular system of the Fallopian tube has not been clearly defined. Arterial blood originates from anastomoses of the uterine and utero-ovarian arteries in the cow (Hansel & Asdell, 1951), ewe (Sisson & Grossman, 1953), {{and appears to be}} similar in the sow (Oxenreider, McGlure & Day, 1965).

40|$|The ostrich {{industry}} is a small, important section {{of the economy in}} the Republic of South Africa. The demand for ostrich products is high in the world, but the ostrich industry faces some production problems, one of which is the low fertility of commercially farmed ostriches. This study aimed to determine the vasculature of the reproductive system in the male ostrich and determine the kind of blood-testis and blood-epididymis barriers, since there is no published information regarding this aspect. Thus 85 pre-pubertal and adult sexually active male ostrich were studied. <b>Arterial</b> supply, venous <b>drainage,</b> microvasculature of the male reproductive system, and blood-testis and blood-epididymal barriers, were determined in this specie, for the first time. Results show that the pattern of the arterial blood supply to the reproductive organs of the male ostrich {{is similar to that of}} the domestic fowl and pigeon. However, few highlighted, distinctive, features were noted, the communication between the cranial renal arteries and middle renal arteries via collateral circulation. The pattern of the venous drainage of the reproductive organs of the male ostrich, was similar to that described in the domestic fowl. However, important differences were the fusion between the caudal renal veins and the existence of a unique caudal median vein that had the caudal mesenteric vein as tributary. The epithelial structure in the proximal efferent ducts was consistent with fluid absorption. The fluid absorbed in the efferent ducts is harvested also by capillary lymphatics situated in the interstitium. Both the cranial and caudal segments of Ductus deferens and the Receptaculum ductus deferentis displayed one vascular networks beneath the tubular epithelium and other capillaries, venules, arterioles and collecting veins were in the periphery. Arterioles and collecting veins were also under the serosa. Subepithelial capillaries, in those segments, lacked fenestrations. The spongy structure, in the root of phallus, exhibited several blood vessels in the strands. The capillaries and the venules displayed fenestrations. The erectile tissue in the phallic sulcus had the same features like the spongy in phallus. The spongy is comparable to corpus paracloacal vascular body present in other avian species and it should be called lymphobulbus phalli, it is the main source of lymph for phallus erection in the male ostrich. There are similarities in the microvasculature pattern between ostrich and domestic fowl, but there are some differences in the ostrich: (i) Absence of fenestrations in the capillaries of testis, (ii) Very simple and random distribution of stromal blood capillaries, arterioles and venules in the epididymis, Endothelial fenestrations, only in the blood capillaries close to proximal efferent ducts, (iv) Isolated lymphatic capillaries in the epididymis, occasionally, presented endothelial fenestrations fitted with a membranous diaphragm, (v) Existence of three vascular networks surrounding the tubule of deferent duct and receptaculum, that were determined on the base of the distribution, location and size of the vessels. The blood-testis barrier of the ostrich is positioned: in (i) the capillary endothelium in the interstitium, between adjacent seminiferous tubule, (ii) the boundary tissue, and (iii) between spermatogonia and spermatocytes, and spermatogonia and Sertoli cells, and finally, (iv) between Sertoli cells. The occluding junctional complexes between the various tissue or cellular elements are mainly tight junctions. The blood-epididymal barrier in the ostrich is revealed by participation of the endothelium of the capillaries and venules in the epididymal region, as lanthanum is trapped there, it does not appear beyond that point. The blood-testis and blood-epididymal barriers are similar to those described for the domestic rooster. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013. Anatomy and PhysiologyPhDUnrestricte...|$|R

40|$|This paper revisits {{a widely}} cited {{study of the}} Boyne {{catchment}} in east Ireland that attributed greater streamflow from the mid- 1970 s to increased precipitation linked to {{a shift in the}} North Atlantic Oscillation. Using the method of multiple working hypotheses we explore a wider set of potential drivers of hydrological change. Rainfall–runoff models are used to reconstruct streamflow to isolate the effect of climate, taking account of both model structure and parameter uncertainty. The Mann–Kendall test for monotonic trend and Pettitt change point test are applied to explore signatures of change. Contrary to earlier work, <b>arterial</b> <b>drainage</b> and simultaneous onset of field drainage in the 1970 s and early 1980 s are now invoked as the predominant drivers of change in annual mean and high flows within the Boyne. However, a change in precipitation regime is also present in March, thereby amplifying the effect of drainage. This new explanation posits that multiple drivers acting simultaneously were responsible for the observed change, with the relative contribution of each driver dependant on the timescale investigated. This work demonstrates that valuable insights can be gained from a systematic application of the method of multiple working hypotheses in an effort to move towards more rigorous attribution, which {{is an important part of}} managing emerging impacts on hydrological systems...|$|E
40|$|There is {{abundant}} landscape evidence for extensive land reclamation conducted within the Shannon estuary wetlands. To date, little published research is available which identifies how much reclamation has occurred, its timing and the likely environmental implications. This paper addresses these {{questions on the}} basis of available cartographic and documentary data on land reclamation in this area. Identification of reclaimed land was based on the 2 nd Edition Ordnance Survey of Ireland Map Series of 1924. These maps represent landscape features relating to reclamation, such as embankments, artificial <b>arterial</b> <b>drainage</b> channels and sluices. Using such indicators for the purpose of demarcation, the extent of the lands reclaimed has been mapped. Documentary information on reclamation schemes was acquired from the National Archives files on the Irish Quit Rent Office, including letters, memoranda, draft bills and Government Acts, legal documents and statements of account, and these support and supplement cartographic data. In total, approximately 6, 500 ha of the Shannon estuary lowlands were reclaimed for agriculture and other purposes. This has significantly altered the morphometric characteristics of the estuary, as embankments and revetments for flood protection have reduced the potential energy dissipation area and the water storage capacity of the estuarine wetlands. Reclamation has resulted in modification of the estuarine physical environment and its hydrodynamics, and altered the character of the wetland habitat in the estuary environs...|$|E

Examination of the between site community heterogeneity (beta diversity) indicated that differences among ditches were high spatially and temporally. The results illustrate that both main arterial and side ditches make a unique contribution to aquatic biodiversity of the agricultural landscape. Given the need to maintain drainage ditches to support agriculture and flood defence measures, we advocate the application of principles from ‘reconciliation ecology’ to inform the future management and conservation of drainage ditches...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary genetic {{structure}} of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in the River Moy in Ireland is shown {{here to be}} strongly related to landscape features and population demographics, with populations being defined largely by their degree of physical isolation and their size. Samples of juvenile salmon were collected from the 17 major spawning areas on the river Moy and from one spawning area in each of five smaller nearby rivers. No temporal allele frequency differences were observed within locations for 12 microsatellite loci, whereas nearly all spatial samples differed significantly suggesting that each was a separate population. Bayesian clustering and landscape genetic analyses suggest that these populations can be combined hierarchically into five genetically informative larger groupings. Lakes {{were found to be}} the single most important determinant of the observed population structure. Spawning area size was also an important factor. The salmon population of the closest nearby river resembled genetically the largest Moy population grouping. In addition we showed that anthropogenic influences on spawning habitats, in this case <b>arterial</b> <b>drainage,</b> can affect relationships between populations. Our results show that Atlantic salmon biodiversity can be largely defined by geography and thus knowledge of landscape features (for example, as characterised within Geographical Information Systems) has the potential, to predict population structure in other rivers without an intensive genetic survey, or at least to help direct sampling. This approach of combining genetics and geography, for sampling and in subsequent statistical analyses, has wider application to the investigation of population structure in other freshwater/anadromous fish species and possibly in marine fish and other organisms. peer-reviewe...|$|E

Using the method of multiple working hypotheses we explore a wider set of potential drivers of hydrological change. Rainfall-runoff models are used to reconstruct streamflow to isolate the effect of climate, taking account of both model structure and parameter uncertainty. The Mann-Kendall test for monotonic trend and Pettitt change point test are applied to explore signatures of change. Contrary to earlier work, <b>arterial</b> <b>drainage</b> and simultaneous onset of field drainage in the 1970 s and early 1980 s are now invoked as the predominant drivers of change in annual mean and high flows within the Boyne. However, a change in precipitation regime is also present in March, thereby amplifying the effect of drainage. This new explanation posits that multiple drivers acting simultaneously were responsible for the observed change, with the relative contribution of each driver dependant on the timescale investigated. This work demonstrates that valuable insights can be gained from a systematic application of the method of multiple working hypotheses in an effort to move towards more rigorous attribution, which {{is an important part of}} managing emerging impacts on hydrological systems. © Author(s) 2014...|$|E
40|$|<b>Arterial</b> <b>drainage</b> {{helps in}} the process of land {{reclamation}} by lowering the level of the existing river bed and allowing the ground water to run off more quickly. In recent years the Rivers Corrib, Dee-Glyde, and Moy have been drained. The effects of drainage on the fish stocks and the invertebrate fauna of the River Moy have been described by Toner, 0 'Riordan and Twomey (1965). In 1968 investigations commenced into the effects of drainage on the invertebrate fauna and flora as well as fish stocks in the Trimblestown, or Athboy, River, a tributary of the River Boyne. The Boyne rises 6. 4 km from Edenderry and flows north-east for 112 km to the sea at Drogheda. It has fifteen tributary streams and two lakes in its catchment area of 2, 693 square km. A section of the Trimblestovn River which rises at the foot of Slieve na Calligh, Co Westmesth and flows south-east for 35 km to meet the Boyne at the town of Trim was selected. Its shallowness and accessibility made it particularly suitable for the study. The study area 4. 8 km north of Athboy town, was 146 metres long and averaged 6. 1 metres wide. The river flows for its entire length over Carboniferous limestone end the bed of the river consists of gavel and sandy silt, with scattered boulders and some mud in the quieter areas. There are a few pools in this section, the river being composed of riffle areas alternating with flats. The normal flow at this point was 0. 77 cubic metres per second, the pH was 7. 6 and the alkalinity as CaCo 3 was 310 p. p. m. From 1968 and 1970, 57 invertebrate fauna samples from standard areas (0. 093 sq. m) were taken with a suber stream bottom sampler. The plant life was mapped and an assessment of the fish population was made, by the depletion method...|$|E
40|$|Rapidly-flowing ice streams are the <b>arterial</b> <b>drainage</b> {{routes in}} {{continental}} ice sheets and exert {{a major influence}} on ice sheet mass balance. Recent observations have revealed that ice stream flow exhibits considerable variability, with relatively rapid changes taking place in speed and direction. This spatial and temporal variability is intimately linked to the conditions {{at the base of the}} ice streams and the distribution of localised patches of basal friction, known as ‘sticky spots’. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of sticky spot observations from both contemporary and palaeo-ice stream beds in order to better understand their nature and influence. Observations and theoretical considerations reveal four primary causes of ‘stickiness’: (i), bedrock bumps; (ii), till-free areas; (iii), areas of ‘strong’ (well drained) till; and (iv), freeze-on of subglacial meltwater. These may act together in one location, or in isolation; and a progressive increase in their distribution could lead to ice stream shut-down. Bedrock bumps are influential under active ice streams, where they provide form drag and can create thinner ice which increases the likelihood of basal freeze-on. Increased bed roughness may prevent the lateral migration of some ice streams but bedrock bumps are unlikely to cause ice stream shut-down because, over long time-scales, ice stream erosion might be expected to reduce their amplitude. The influence of till-free areas beneath an ice stream will depend critically on the amount of water that might be drawn out of the surrounding till to lubricate such areas. They are likely to be most important in ice stream onset zones but their identification has proved difficult beneath active ice streams. If an ice stream operates solely by till deformation, it is conceivable that a progressive increase in the exposure of till-free areas could lead to shut-down through a process of sediment exhaustion. Areas of strong, well drained till have been identified beneath both active and ancient ice streams and are most likely to result from the reorganisation of subglacial meltwater. The collapse of an inefficient ‘cannalised’ system to a more efficient ‘channelised’ system can occur rapidly and this mechanism has been hypothesised as a candidate for ice stream shut-down in both contemporary and palaeo-settings. Basal freeze-on has also been observed and inferred from beneath modern and palaeo-ice streams, and a reduction in basal meltwater supply coupled with ice stream drawdown and the advection of cold ice increases the likelihood of switching off an ice stream. A paucity of data from ice stream sticky spots limits a better understanding of their nature, distribution and evolution beneath ice streams. Future technological advances are likely to improve the resolution of the data collected from the beds of modern ice streams but well-preserved palaeo-ice stream beds also hold potential for investigating their influence on ice stream flow and we present simple landsystems models to aid their identification. Such data will considerably enhance the basal boundary condition in ice stream models which will, ultimately, refine our predictions of the response of contemporary ice sheets to future changes in climate...|$|E
