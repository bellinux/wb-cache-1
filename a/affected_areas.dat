5|$|By {{two days}} after the storm, the {{government}} of Mexico sent two airplanes to Acapulco, where the food, clothing, and medicine were distributed by truck or helicopter to the <b>affected</b> <b>areas.</b> The Mexican government arranged plans to drop food and medical aid into isolated villages, although food supplies were initially insufficient for the great number of people affected by the storm. Five army units and three helicopters were sent to the region to assist in the aftermath, although planes encountered difficulties in landing due to flooded runways. Army soldiers were responsible for rescue operations, while paratroopers were sent to the most <b>affected</b> <b>areas</b> to distribute aid. Despite fears of the spread of disease in the aftermath, prompt work by medical officials prevented any epidemics due to the storm.|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} role of {{competitive}} and cooperative neural interactions within the intermediate layer of superior colliculus (SC), they elevated the basal SC neuronal activity by locally injecting a cholinergic agonist nicotine and analyzed its effects on saccade performance. After microinjection, spontaneous saccades were directed toward the movement field of neurons at the injection site (<b>affected</b> <b>area).</b> For visually guided saccades, reaction times were decreased when targets were presented close to the <b>affected</b> <b>area.</b> However, when visual targets were presented remote from the <b>affected</b> <b>area,</b> reaction times were not increased regardless of the rostro-caudal level of the injection sites. The endpoints of visually guided saccades were biased toward the <b>affected</b> <b>area</b> when targets were presented close to the <b>affected</b> <b>area.</b> After this endpoint effect diminished, the trajectories of visually guided saccades remained modestly curved toward the <b>affected</b> <b>area.</b> Compared to the effects on endpoints, the effects on reaction times were more localized to the targets close to the <b>affected</b> <b>area.</b> These {{results are consistent with}} a model that saccades are triggered by the activities of neurons within a restricted region and the endpoints and trajectories of the saccades are determined by the widespread population activity in the SC. However, because increased reaction times were not observed for saccades toward targets remote from the <b>affected</b> <b>area,</b> inhibitory interactions in the SC may not be strong enough to shape the spatial distribution of the low-frequency preparatory activities in the SC...|$|R

5|$|Four {{days prior}} to Vamei moving ashore, the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) issued storm {{advisories}} for potentially <b>affected</b> <b>areas.</b> Subsequently, the agency issued warnings for heavy rainfall, high winds, and rough seas.

5|$|Later, as with Tropical Storm Bilis a month earlier, Saomai's outer rainbands <b>affected</b> <b>areas</b> of the Philippines. Over 400 {{homes were}} {{destroyed}} by storm surge, and two people were killed. At least seven people were reported missing.|$|E

5|$|Relief and {{reconstruction}} measures were enacted in the British Honduras beginning on September30. A large-scale reconstruction program was {{initiated by the}} government to help rebuild 48villages. The government also {{declared a state of emergency}} for Corozal, Orange Walk, and Belize administrative districts, including a ban on liquor sales. Temporary communication lines were rebuilt, which initially only allowed official communications with <b>affected</b> <b>areas.</b> Due to the severity of the damage in Corozal, an airstrip was built to help deliver relief to the city more efficiently. Food depots in Corozal, Louisville, and Orange Walk Town were tasked with distributing food. The potential for widespread disease following the devastation wrought by Janet forced a widespread vaccination initiative against typhoid fever in <b>affected</b> <b>areas.</b> The Jamaican government sent £20,000 (US$55,000) to the colony in relief funds, while the British government sent £40,000 (US$110,000) to <b>affected</b> <b>areas</b> in the British Honduras and other affected islands in the Caribbean. The United States sent the cargo ship USS Antares, which supplied the colony with various relief materials. In Corozal Town, a $3.5million grant was given to land surveyor H.C. Fairweather to plan and reconstruct the township.|$|E
5|$|After the hurricane's passage, {{officials}} deployed the Florida National Guard to <b>affected</b> <b>areas</b> {{in order}} to maintain order and quell looting. Across Florida, a total of 3,897people filed damage claims after receiving damage from the hurricane, 80% of them in the Miami area. Insurance companies paid about $1million to compensate for the storm damage. Due to the loss in citrus crop, prices briefly increased, although they returned to normal levels by late October.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, the American Red Cross brought {{supplies}} to areas {{affected by the}} hurricane, requesting as much as $10,000 in relief work. Several other local relief committees also brought {{supplies to}} <b>affected</b> <b>areas.</b> An estimated $2million in damages from the storm were attributed to crop damage alone, especially rice and cotton. The storm was estimated to have killed 40people and caused $7.5million in damage.|$|E

5|$|As the {{hurricane}} approached Texas, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings for potentially <b>affected</b> <b>areas</b> beginning on July18. Ships and ports were also continuously notified on the oncoming storm, which helped to keep offshore shipping accidents to a minimum.

5|$|In {{response}} to Delores' approach, the Mexican government issued {{a tropical storm}} warning and a hurricane watch from Ixtapa to Manzanillo on June 24.

The Government of Mexico reported that 4,700 blankets, 2,900 mattresses, 5,554 bottles of water (each containing 500milliliters), 260,000 boxes of milk, 250,000 packages of biscuits, and 12,400 boxes of school supplies had been distributed.|$|E
5|$|On October27, the Yemen {{government}} requested {{assistance from}} the international community, unable to provide disaster assessments or cope with the rebuilding. The storm <b>affected</b> <b>areas</b> of Yemen that already had poor infrastructure and lack of food, and were generally under a state of political unrest, which made recovery difficult. In some areas, relief distribution was duplicated {{due to lack of}} coordination while some areas did not receive help. Yemen's Deputy Prime Minister for Internal Affairs coordinated the relief efforts, in conjunction with the governors of the most <b>affected</b> <b>areas.</b> The government focused on streamlining disaster activities and toward future mitigation. However, there was no coordinated disaster plan as of September 2009, and the scale of the disaster proved too great for ministries to handle. The Ministry of Public Works helped reopen roads, which allowed for the transport of relief goods, and the damaged Sayun Airport was repaired to withstand future floods. By December 2008, most roads, power systems, hospitals, and communication services were restored. The government also enacted the Fund for Hadramout and Al-Mahara Reconstruction, which failed to promptly distribute aid assistance.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Cyclone John's landfall, {{hundreds}} of people were evacuated from homes, primarily in Karratha, where two shelters were set up.
