5|$|C.mutica were <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> in Ketchikan, Sitka, Juneau, Cordova, Kodiak, Kachemak Bay, Prince William Sound, and Unalaska in Alaska between 2000 and 2003. This was {{the first}} {{instance}} of a non-native marine species being found in the Aleutian Islands. In 2009, they were discovered to have spread into British Columbia, Canada. This indicates that C.mutica have completely expanded up the entire west coast of North America.|$|E

The first {{discovery}} of gold, at Rancho San Francisco in the mountains north of present-day Los Angeles, had been in 1842, six years before Marshall's discovery, while California was still part of Mexico. However, these first deposits, and later discoveries in Southern California mountains, attracted little notice and were of limited consequence economically.|$|E

5|$|This rockfowl is {{protected}} {{in some of}} the areas in which it lives by national parks. Additionally, there seems to be little habitat destruction in Gabon and on Bioko as the locations in these places in which the rockfowl lives is believed to be too inaccessible for future human development.

5|$|A 2004-05 EPA {{study of}} the river rated the water quality 6 out of 100. The study <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> that {{dissolved}} oxygen levels in the water were low because there were few organisms, poor sediment, and little plant life in the river. Although storm water from residential neighborhoods added dissolved oxygen, it also brought ammonia from fertilizer. The Army Corps of Engineers found that the channeling prevented aquatic life from sustaining itself; few fish naturally spawn in the river because of the cement casing and flume at its mouth.|$|E
5|$|After the Russian Revolution, {{universities}} were opened to women, allowing Rand {{to be in}} the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University.

In 1950, he {{became a member of the}} General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). He was appointed a commissioner in 1954, becoming its sole scientist. He sided with Edward Teller on pursuing a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, participated in the Atoms for Peace program, and defended the administration's atmospheric nuclear testing.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, {{the star}} {{with the highest}} known {{absolute}} magnitude is LBV 1806-20, with a magnitude of −14.2. This star is at least 5,000,000 times more luminous than the Sun.

The faintest red dwarfs in the cluster were magnitude 26, while a 28th magnitude white dwarf was <b>also</b> <b>discovered.</b> These faint stars are so dim that their light is as bright as a birthday candle on the Moon when viewed from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|At {{the mouth}} of the Rogue River, along the coast of Curry County, is the Otter Point Formation, a mélange of metamorphosed {{sedimentary}} rocks such as shales, sandstones, and chert.

Oregon's only dinosaur fragments, those of a hadrosaur or duck-billed dinosaur, were found here. In the mid-1960s, a geologist <b>also</b> <b>discovered</b> the beak and teeth of an ichthyosaur in the Otter Point Formation.|$|E
