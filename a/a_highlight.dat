5|$|At {{the end of}} the year, Lindwall gained his Leaving Certificate.

During the 1939–40 season, Lindwall's bowling was only moderately successful, with 16 wickets at 34.93. <b>A</b> <b>highlight</b> of the season was an unbeaten 49 as St. George won the grade final.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>highlight</b> of {{the series}} in 1959 was when the Russians allowed Moore {{to be the first}} Westerner to see the {{photographic}} results of the Luna 3 probe, and to show them live on air. Less successful was the transmission of the Luna 4 probe, which ran into technical difficulties and around this time Moore famously swallowed a large fly; both episodes were live and Moore had to continue regardless. He was invited to visit the Soviet Union, where he met Yuri Gagarin, the first man to journey into outer space. For the fiftieth episode of The Sky at Night, in September 1961, Moore's attempt {{to be the first to}} broadcast a live direct telescopic view of a planet resulted in another unintended 'comedy episode', as cloud obscured the sky.|$|E

5|$|Deathrow {{received}} largely favorable reviews.

IGN and TeamXbox both named Deathrow an Editor's Choice. The game won the TeamXbox 2002 Breakthrough Game of the Year award and the IGN 2002 Best Game Nobody Played. IGN later reported that a sequel would be unlikely due to the original's low revenue. Southend dissolved in 2013.|$|E
