25|$|Robert Schwartz {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} 6-MP on the immune response in 1958 and discovered that it profoundly suppresses the formation of antibodies when given to rabbits together with antigens. Following the work done by Sir Peter Medawar and Gertrude Elion in discovering the immunological basis of rejection of transplanted tissues and organs, and Schwartz's researches on 6-MP, Sir Roy Calne, the British pioneer in transplantation, introduced 6-MP as an experimental immunosuppressant for kidney and heart transplants. When Calne asked Elion for related compounds to investigate, she suggested azathioprine, which was subsequently found out to be superior (as effective and less toxic to the bone marrow) by Calne. On 5 April 1962, with regimens consisting of azathioprine and prednisone, the transplantation of kidneys to unrelated recipients (<b>allotransplantation)</b> was successful for the first time. For many years, this kind of dual therapy with azathioprine and glucocorticoids was the standard antirejection regimen, until ciclosporin was introduced into clinical practice (by Calne as well) in 1978.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} islet {{transplantation}} is not new. [...] Investigators {{as early as}} the English surgeon Charles Pybus (1882–1975) attempted to graft pancreatic tissue to cure diabetes. Most, however, credit the recent era of islet transplantation research to Paul Lacy's studies dating back more than three decades. In 1967, Lacy's group described a novel collagenase-based method (later modified by Dr. Camillo Ricordi, then working with Dr. Lacy) to isolate islets, paving the way for future in vitro and in vivo islet experiments. Subsequent studies showed that transplanted islets could reverse diabetes in both rodents and non-human primates. In a summary of the 1977 Workshop on Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplantation in Diabetes, Lacy commented on the feasibility of “islet cell transplantation as a therapeutic approach [...] the possible prevention of the complications of diabetes in man”. Improvements in isolation techniques and immunosuppressive regimens ushered in the first human islet transplantation clinical trials in the mid-1980s. The first successful trial of human islet <b>allotransplantation</b> resulting in long-term reversal of diabetes was performed at the University of Pittsburgh in 1990. Yet despite continued procedural improvements, only about 10% of islet recipients in the late 1990s achieved euglycemia (normal blood glucose). In 2000, Dr. James Shapiro and colleagues published a report describing seven consecutive patients who achieved euglycemia following islet transplantation using a steroid-free protocol and large numbers of donor islets, since referred to as the Edmonton protocol. This protocol has been adapted by islet transplant centers around the world and has greatly increased islet transplant success.|$|E

Immune privileged allografts survive even without immunosuppression, which is routinely applied to different tissue/organ recipients. Research suggests that the exploitation of anterior chamber-associated immune deviation (ACAID), aqueous humor and its anti-inflammatory properties and the induction of regulatory T cells (Treg) may lead to increased survival of allotransplants.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} oxidative damage to renal allografts during graft rejection by evaluating changes in oxidative markers and plasma lactate levels in feline renal allotransplant recipients. Heterotopic renal <b>allotransplantations</b> were performed between 8 adult feline cross-matched donors. Following 14 d of immunosuppression, the drugs were discontinued to allow allograft rejection. Baseline and serial postoperative evaluations of serum creatinine, plasma lactate, plasma thiobarbituate reactive substances (TBARS), plasma creatol, urine creatol, and renal sonographic cross-sectional area were performed. When sonographic evaluation revealed the absence of blood flow to the allograft, the rejected kidney was nephrectomized and evaluated histopathologically. Allograft rejection occurred in all cats by day 26. A significant elevation in body temperature occurred during the rejection period. No significant change was observed between any of the time periods for plasma TBARS, creatol, or urine creatol. There was a significant decrease in plasma lactate levels throughout the study. Markers of oxidative stress from venous blood did not reflect renal allograft rejection in cats with a normally functioning native kidney.

50|$|Another {{option to}} bridge the gap is nerve <b>allotransplantation.</b> Nerve allografts are {{prepared}} from donated human nerve tissue. An allograft contains many of the beneficial characteristics of nerve autograft, such as three-dimensional microstructural scaffolding and protein components inherent to nerve tissue. One of the adverse effects of nerve <b>allotransplantation</b> is the immunogenic response. Tissue from another human being is used to restore the defect, which can induce an immunogenic response. An immune response against an allograft or xenograft is called Transplant rejection. To prevent this rejection, new immunosuppressive techniques are performed on the graft, before it is transplanted into the receiver. The donated nerve tissue is disinfected, by selectively removing cellular components and debris to cleave growth inhibitors and then terminally sterilized. These procedures make the immunogenic response insignificant. Since a couple of decades processed nerve allografts has been used to restore nerve continuity.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, major {{modifications}} {{in the way we}} treat head and neck cancers, due to advances in technology and medical oncology, have led to a decline in the use of open surgery as first-line treatment of cancers arising from several primary tumor sites. The incidence of tobacco- and alcohol-related squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx and larynx has been steadily decreasing, with a rise in the incidence of human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal tumors and the use of minimally invasive endoscopic surgery and non-surgical treatment modalities has increased in the treatment of all of these tumors. However, open surgery remains the initial definitive treatment modality for other tumors, including tumors of the skin, oral cavity, sinonasal cavities and skull base, salivary glands, thyroid and sarcomas. Selected group of nasal, paranasal, base of the skull and thyroid tumors are also candidates for minimally invasive procedures.

40|$|ObjectivesCardiovascular allografts in {{the young}} have limited {{durability}} because of early graft calcification. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the hypothesis that growth-associated hyperphosphatemia in youth accelerates aortic allograft calcification by osteogenic transformation of graft medial smooth muscle cells (SMCs). MethodsThe descending aortas of donor rats were subcutaneously transplanted into recipients. Syngeneic (Lewis-to-Lewis) transplantations between 3 -week-old “young” (Y) rats and between 10 -week-old “adult” (A) rats were combined with standard (ST, 0. 9 % phosphate) and low-phosphate (LP, 0. 2 %) diets, resulting in Y-ST, Y-LP, and A-ST groups. <b>Allotransplantations</b> (Brown-Norway–to–Lewis) involving these ages and diets were also made. The grafts and sera were retrieved from recipients after 14 days. Cultured rat aortic SMCs were used to analyze the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and phosphate on SMC calcification. ResultsIn vivo, serum phosphate levels were higher in Y-ST (11. 5 mg/dL) than those in Y-LP (8. 9 mg/dL) and A-ST (8. 5 mg/dL). Graft medial calcification appeared severe only in Y-ST. Allotransplants did not affect these outcomes. Graft medial cells showed phenotypic changes (contractile to synthetic) and osteogenic transformation (α-smooth muscle actin to Runx 2 and osteocalcin), together with up-regulated proinflammatory TNF-α and sodium–phosphate cotransporter, Pit- 1, despite ages and diets. In vitro, TNF-α induced phenotypic changes and osteogenic transformation of SMCs with Pit- 1 up-regulation, but SMC calcification occurred only with high phosphate (4. 5 mmol/L). ConclusionsGrowth-associated hyperphosphatemia with inflammatory responses may be essential for accelerating allograft calcification in youth and could be a therapeutic target...|$|R

To assess the nature and frequency of allograft contamination and associated surgical infection the case records from our institutional bone bank were reviewed. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed the microbiology of discarded bone allografts and the surgical site of the recipients. A case series of patients who acquired surgical site infection after allogenic bone transplantation was presented. Swab culturing was conducted on 309 femoral heads from living donors who underwent partial and total hip arthroplasty between January 2007 and December 2013. To prevent potential bone allograft contamination we used saline solution of 2. 0 mg/ml of amikacin during thawing. The overall infection rate was analyzed in 197 recipients. Results. Of the 309 donated femoral heads, 37 were discarded due to bacterial contamination, giving the overall contamination rate of 11. 97 %. The postoperative survey of 213 bone <b>allotransplantations</b> among 197 recipients showed the infection rate of 2. 03 %.
