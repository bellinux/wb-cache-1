5|$|Education about {{oral hygiene}} for {{long-term}} methamphetamine users is sometimes required. Changes in diet are often necessary for recovering drug users that are receiving dental treatment, {{and the use}} of sugar-free gum may be beneficial. The consumption of water and the avoidance of beverages with a diuretic (dehydrating) effect can <b>also</b> <b>help</b> patients with meth mouth.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes of {{the smooth}} ER can <b>also</b> <b>help</b> detoxify drugs and poisons. Detoxification usually {{involves}} {{the addition of}} a hydroxyl group to a drug, making the drug more soluble and thus easier to purge from the body. One extensively studied detoxification reaction is carried out by the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, which catalyze water-insoluble drugs or metabolites that would otherwise accumulate to toxic levels in cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may <b>also</b> <b>help</b> prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may <b>also</b> <b>help</b> calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E

5|$|Ideasthesia {{theory of}} art {{may be used}} for {{psychological}} studies of aesthetics. It may <b>also</b> <b>help</b> explain classificatory disputes about art as its main tenet is that experience of art can only be individual, depending on person's unique knowledge, experiences and history. There could exist no general classification of art satisfactorily applicable to each and all individuals.|$|E
5|$|Imelda {{would often}} ask {{members of the}} Blue Ladies to {{accompany}} her on her trips out of the country. Imelda would <b>also</b> <b>help</b> {{some of the members}} in their investments and own businesses. One of her most famous socialite friends was Cristina Ford.|$|E
5|$|Internet {{searches}} {{for information on}} suicide return webpages that 10-30% of the time encourage or facilitate suicide attempts. There is some concern that such sites may push those predisposed over the edge. Some people form suicide pacts online, either with pre-existing friends or people they have recently encountered in chat rooms or message boards. The Internet, however, may <b>also</b> <b>help</b> prevent suicide by providing a social group {{for those who are}} isolated.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to prevent the onset of prepatellar bursitis, or prevent the symptoms from worsening, by avoiding trauma to the knee or frequent kneeling. Protective knee pads can <b>also</b> <b>help</b> prevent prepatellar bursitis for those whose professions require frequent kneeling and for athletes who play contact sports, such as American football, basketball, and wrestling.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about how ctenophores get rid of waste {{products}} produced by the cells. The ciliary rosettes in the gastrodermis may help to remove wastes from the mesoglea, and may <b>also</b> <b>help</b> to adjust the animal's buoyancy by pumping water into {{or out of the}} mesoglea.|$|E
5|$|Many {{brachytherapy}} {{procedures are}} performed on an outpatient basis. This convenience {{may be particularly}} relevant for patients who have to work, older patients, or patients who live some distance from treatment centres, {{to ensure that they}} have access to radiotherapy treatment and adhere to treatment plans. Shorter treatment times and outpatient procedures can <b>also</b> <b>help</b> improve the efficiency of radiotherapy clinics.|$|E

5|$|Many {{wind power}} {{companies}} work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms. In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects. Appropriate government consultation, planning and approval procedures <b>also</b> <b>help</b> to minimize environmental risks. Some may still object to wind farms but, according to The Australia Institute, their concerns should be weighed against {{the need to}} address the threats posed by climate change and the opinions of the broader community.|$|E
5|$|Other imaging methods, such as ultrasonography, {{computed}} tomography (CT), and magnetic imaging (MRI), can aid in diagnosis. Blood tests can <b>also</b> <b>help</b> identify {{the presence of}} infection: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and chlamydial and gonococcal DNA probes.|$|E
5|$|Premastication is {{complementary}} to breastfeeding in {{the health}} practices of infants and young children, providing large amounts of carbohydrate and protein nutrients not always available through breast milk, and micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamin B12 which are essential nutrients present mainly in meat. Compounds in the saliva, such as haptocorrin <b>also</b> <b>help</b> increase B12 availability by protecting the vitamin against stomach acid.|$|E

5|$|Scales {{may have}} evolved {{initially}} for providing insulation. Scales on the thorax {{and other parts}} of the body may contribute to maintaining the high body temperatures required during flight. The 'solid' scales of basal moths are however not as efficient as those of their more advanced relatives as the presence of a lumen adds air layers and increases the insulation value. Scales <b>also</b> <b>help</b> increase the lift to drag ratio in gliding flight.|$|E
5|$|Sir John Anderson {{was eager}} to invite Niels Bohr to the Tube Alloys project {{because he was a}} world-famous {{scientist}} who would not only contribute his expertise to the project, but <b>also</b> <b>help</b> the British government gain leverage in dealings with the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|The {{authors of}} the 2015 study which {{resolved}} the phylogenetic placement of the Mascarene island parakeets suggested that the echo parakeet of Mauritius would be a suitable ecological replacement for the Réunion parakeet and Newton's parakeet, due to their close evolutionary relationship. The echo parakeet was itself close to extinction in the 1980s, numbering only twenty individuals, but has since recovered, so introducing it to the nearby islands could <b>also</b> <b>help</b> secure the survival of this species.|$|E

5|$|These {{are used}} to cover the {{cylinder}} valve orifice when the cylinder is not in use to prevent dust, water or other materials from contaminating the orifice. They can <b>also</b> <b>help</b> prevent the O-ring of a yoke type valve from falling out.

5|$|Although IFA {{can be used}} {{to confirm}} {{infection}} in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used. In general, a second specimen should be collected more than a month later and retested for persons with indeterminate western blot results. Although much less commonly available, nucleic acid testing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method) can <b>also</b> <b>help</b> diagnosis in certain situations. In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and tested for HIV infection.|$|E
5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony {{can be as}} {{important}} as the music, and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can <b>also</b> <b>help</b> determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, {{as in the case of}} Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, as in the case of Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E
