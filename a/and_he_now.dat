5|$|Ben Stiller as Tugg Speedman: Once the highest-paid, highest-grossing action {{film star}} ever {{due to his}} Scorcher franchise, his career has stalled, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>now</b> has a {{reputation}} for appearing in nothing but box office bombs. After a failed attempt at portraying a serious role in Simple Jack, in which he plays a mentally-challenged farm boy, he takes the role of Four Leaf Tayback in an attempt to save his career. The first faux trailer at the film's start is a preview for Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown, the latest in his series.|$|E
5|$|Buffy's former nemesis is Spike (James Marsters), a vampire. In {{the fourth}} season The Initiative, a secret {{military}} organization whose {{mission is to}} evaluate and eliminate demonic beings, rendered Spike harmless by implanting a microchip in his head that causes him intense pain when he attacks humans. However, the chip does not affect him when he harms demons <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>now</b> often fights on Buffy's side, after at first fighting just {{for the pleasure of}} brawling. His motivations changed when, in the fifth season, Spike realized he {{had fallen in love with}} Buffy. She initially rejected him, but after and just before her death they had begun to form a friendship of sorts. She has been confiding in him; prior to this episode, he is the only one to whom Buffy has revealed that she was in heaven.|$|E
5|$|By 354/353 BC, in just 5 {{years since}} his accession, Philip had unified Macedon {{and turned it}} into the {{dominant}} power in Northern Greece. He had completely reduced Athenian influence in the region, and was allied to the other major Greek power in the region, the Chalkidian League. He had, in the process, secured access to the Aegean sea, which had been an age-old problem in Macedon, since suitable sites had been monopolised by Greek colonists in the Archaic period. Furthermore, he had overhauled and re-trained the army, which was now battle-hardened, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>now</b> had a supply of ready money to pay for more troops.|$|E

5|$|In 1536 {{the natives}} of Yamala, near Tencoa, rebelled; the Spanish responded by burning the Indians' homes and storehouses. Around {{the middle of}} 1536, Pedro de Alvarado {{received}} news that Alonso Maldonado had been appointed to investigate his governorship of Guatemala, and that Francisco de Montejo had finally accepted governorship of Honduras and was en route. Alvarado was incensed, as his decisive intervention had prevented the complete collapse of the Spanish colonisation efforts in the territory, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>now</b> believed the Spanish position to be secure. With Spanish control apparently firmly established in Honduras, he travelled to Puerto de Caballos and sailed back to Spain {{to deal with his}} legal difficulties. He left the province in mid-August.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{noted that}} the Fifth Circuit agreed with Abramski's claim that falsifying the answer to Question 11.a is not {{considered}} material, if the true-buyer can legally buy and possess the gun. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a split between the circuit courts, even though Abramski's defense had changed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>now</b> claimed {{that the answer to}} Question 11.a is never material. Various parties filed amicus briefs supporting either side. Parties supporting Abramski included the National Rifle Association Civil Rights Defense Fund, and West Virginia and 25 other states, while others, like the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Hawaii and 8 other states (plus the District of Columbia), filed amicus briefs supporting Abramski's conviction.|$|E
5|$|Vice-Admiral William Batten {{had been}} forced by Parliamentary {{officials}} to resign from his post as Commander of the Fleet the previous year, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>now</b> encouraged the fleet to join the Royalist faction. Sir Henry Palmer, a former sailor, accompanied by {{other members of the}} Kentish gentry, also called on the fleet to revolt, taking advantage of the many fellow Kentish men in the crews. Sandown Castle declared for the King, followed shortly afterwards by the garrisons at Deal and Walmer as well. With both the coastal fortresses and the navy now under Royalist control, Parliament feared that foreign forces might be landed along the coast or aid sent to the Scots.|$|E

5|$|In 1875, Carte {{became the}} {{business}} {{manager of the}} Royalty Theatre, {{under the direction of}} his client, the popular singing actress Madame Selina Dolaro. There he programmed Offenbach's La Périchole. To fill out the evening (as long programmes were the fashion in Victorian theatre), he needed another piece. He remembered a libretto for a one-act comic opera that W. S. Gilbert had written and shown to him in 1873, called Trial by Jury. Meanwhile, Sullivan's popular 1867 opera, Cox and Box, had been revived at the Gaiety Theatre in 1874, and Carte had already asked him to write a piece for the Royalty. Carte knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create Thespis in 1871, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>now</b> suggested that Sullivan could write the music for Trial by Jury. Because Gilbert and Sullivan shared his vision of increasing the quality and respectability of English musical theatre, and so broadening its audience through the promotion of well-crafted English light operas, Carte gave them wider authority as director and music director than was customary at that time. Trial by Jury, a comic treatment of an English courtroom, was an unexpected hit, outrunning La Périchole, and becoming the first step in Carte's scheme to establish a new genre of English comic opera.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius ordered Mundhir's arrest, and a trap {{was laid}} for the Ghassanid king: summoned to Constantinople to answer charges of treason, Mundhir chose his friend, the curator Magnus, as his advocate. Magnus was {{probably}} a Byzantine, hailing from Huwwarin (Evaria). There he had built a church, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>now</b> called on Mundhir to join him and the patriarch of Antioch Gregory in the dedication ceremony. Mundhir arrived with only a small escort and was arrested by Byzantine troops stationed in secret at the location. He was transported to Constantinople, joined along the way by {{his wife and three}} of his children. At the capital, he was treated well by Tiberius, who allowed him a comfortable residence and a subsidy, but denied him an audience. Irfan Shahîd believes that this generous treatment, as well as {{the fact that he was}} not brought to trial for his supposed treason, indicate that Tiberius too did not believe the charges, but ordered the arrest chiefly to placate the strong anti-Monophysite faction in the imperial capital.|$|E
