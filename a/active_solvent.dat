Here we consider a polymer in a bacterial bath, i. e. in a solvent consisting of active particles which bring in nonequilibrium fluctuations. Using computer simulations of a self-avoiding polymer chain in two dimensions which is exposed to a dilute bath of active particles, we show that the Flory-scaling exponent is unaffected by the bath activity provided the chain is very long. Conversely, for shorter chains, there is a nontrivial coupling between the bacteria intruding into the chain which may stiffen and expand the chain in a nonuniversal way. As {{a function of the}} molecular weight, the swelling first scales faster than described by the Flory exponent, then an unusual plateau-like behaviour is reached and finally a crossover to the universal Flory behaviour is observed.

40|$|It is {{expected}} that a chiral solvent can induce an asymmetry in the ternary solubility phase diagram of two enantiomers. Despite this concept was considered as a relevant tool {{since the beginning of}} the 20 th century, only a few studies can be found in the literature [1]. For example, Yamamoto et al. reported solubility differences in the case of a chiral cobalt salt in pure enantiomeric diethyl tartrate [2]. However, no general conclusions can be deduced from the reported studies. We propose to establish the complete ternary phase diagrams both for compound and conglomerate forming systems, in order to quantify and understand how chiral solvent-solute interactions can affect them. General conclusions regarding the feasibility of chiral resolutions with the help of optically <b>active</b> <b>solvents</b> are intended. Preliminary work involved the investigation of the effect of ethyl lactate as chiral solvent on the enantiomeric mandelic acid system. Up to now, several solubility isotherms in the ternary phase diagram as a function of the enantiomeric excess of the solvent ((S) -ethyl lactate / (R) -ethyl lactate) have been determined. However, no exploitable effect was observed in this system. In order to detect the impact of the chiral solvent interactions in general, currently we screen a variety of chiral solvents. For this purpose, we consider that the best solvent candidate should be able to recognize the solute chirality by means of selective or specific non-covalent interactions. There is large experience in using chiral solvents as a chemical shift agent in NMR spectroscopy [3]. We use a similar approach in order to detect the existence of specific chiral interactions in solution, which might provide a more suitable situation for modifying the solid-liquid equilibria. [1] J.

40|$|Abstract—Ethyl acetate {{with the}} minimum purity of 85. 0 % by mole is inevitably needed as an <b>active</b> <b>solvent</b> {{used in a}} wide range of {{applications}} across many industries. It is normally produced by the esterification of ethanol and acetic acid. Due to the equilibrium limitation, it has been reported that the ethyl acetate with the maximum purity of 52. 0 % can be obtained in a batch reactor. To achieve higher purity, further purification unit is added with the use of some energy. Alternatively, to overcome the limitation, a batch reactive distillation column, combining the reaction and separation into a single stage, is proposed. The ethyl acetate is always distilled and withdrawn out the reaction zone and the equilibrium is shifted to the right. The reactant conversion is then improved. Therefore, the objective of this work is to study an approach to produce ethyl acetate with the purity of 90. 0 % by mole by a batch reactive distillation column. Based on open loop simulations, the distillation with constant reflux ratio cannot achieve the product specification. Thus, dynamic optimization strategy is proposed to handle this problem. The optimization problem is formulated to maximize the weight of distillate product for a given product specification, reboiler heat duty, and batch operating time. For the process safety—preventing the dried column and fractured, minimum reflux ratio must be determined in advance and then an optimal reflux profile is calculated to achieve optimal product yield. Simulation results show that 90. 0 % purity of distillate product can be produced by the dynamic optimization programming with two or more time intervals. Besides, the higher time intervals results in the higher distillate product. Index Terms—batch reactive distillation, dynamic optimization, high purity ethyl acetate, optimal contro...|$|E

It is confirmed that the CO 2 hydration constitutes a case of <b>active</b> <b>solvent</b> catalysis where solvent molecules actively participate as a catalyst in the chemical process. In aqueous solution the hydration mechanism is multimolecular, where geometric parameters of the solvent fully intervene in the reaction coordinate. The hydration reaction was found to proceed through an attack of a water oxygen to the CO 2 carbon in concert with a proton transfer to a CO 2 oxygen. The proton transfer is assisted by a chain of water molecules, which is necessary for a proton relay between different oxygens. Owing to a significantly larger charge separation in the transition structures, nonspecific electrostatic interactions between solute and solvent continuum also play a more important stabilizing role.

In the simplest gas phase system, the most favored path is as follows: protonation of formaldehyde oxime [...] > N-protonated species [...] > O-protonated species [...] > fragmentation products, in which the 1, 2 -H-shift connecting both protonated isomers is rate-determining. While both methyl and formyl substituents on C and O of the oxime have only a small effect on the rate-controlling energy barrier, they significantly modify the barrier to fragmentation. The bulk solvent effect which is treated by a polarizable continuum model does affect only marginally the activation parameters {{with respect to the}} gas phase values. A combination of both quantum and;statistical mechanics was also used to probe the solvent effect. In order to investigate the active role of the solvent, ab initio calculations were carried out within a supermolecule approach. An active participation of one solvent molecule in a reacting supersystem gives rise to a genuine effect. As simple solvent molecules, H 2 O, H 2 C=O, and HCOOH were studied, the latter being a model for the Beckmann solution (HCl + acetic acid + acetic anhydride). While their involvement as a coreactant considerably reduces the barrier of the 1, 2 -H-shift by about 50 % and hence approaches the experimental results, the effect of the bulk solvent on the reacting supersystem remains small.

The chloroform extracts of PH and CRT were most active with MIC 50 in the ranges 0. 01 - viii 10 %v/v and 0. 625 - 10 %v/v respectively, not significantly different from amoxicillin (P> 0. 05); and efficient bactericidal activity (100 % bacterial cells killed) at 1 / 2 MIC and 4 xMIC over different time intervals, 36 - 72 hrs and 18 - 72 hrs respectively. The appearance of bands on the thin layer chromatography (TLC) chromatogram spotted with the chloroform extracts of PH and CRT; and developed with hexane: ethyl acetate: acetic acid (HEA) and methanol: acetic acid: water (MAAW) solvent systems indicated the presence of compounds. Purification of the compounds contained in these extracts over silica gel column yielded numerous fractions which were evaluated for antibacterial activity and purity. PHF 5 was the most active fraction with a mean MIC 50 value of 1. 25 mg/mL. Volatile compounds belonging to different known chemical families in honey were identified in all the active fractions obtained from PH. Conversely, only four compounds were identified in the active fractions obtained from CRT hence the non volatile constituents could be of prime relevance with respect to antibacterial activity of this honey. Of novelty was the presence of thiophene and N-methyl-D 3 -azirdine compounds, essential precursors used for the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals with vital biomedical properties. Linalool demonstrated potent inhibitory (MIC 95, 0. 002 - 0. 0313 mg/mL) and bactericidal activity (0. 0039 - 0. 313 mg/mL) against the test isolates. On the other hand, a significant difference was recorded (P < 0. 05) in comparing the activity of linalool compound to the fractions. PH could serve as a good economic source of bioactive compounds which could be employed as template for the synthesis of novel anti-H. pylori drugs. However, further studies are needed to determine the non volatile active ingredients in PH and CRT as well as toxicological testin...|$|E
40|$|In the {{preliminary}} study {{to find new}} and natural sources of antioxidant, tyrosinase inhibition and antibacterial compounds, methanolic extracts from fifteen fern species were investigated. The total phenolic content (TPC) was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteau method and the antioxidant capacities were measured using the DPPH radical scavenging, ferric reducing power (FRP), metal ion chelating power and β–carotene bleaching (BCB) assays. Five fern species that possessed strong DPPH radical scavenging activity, FRP and BCB activity were Blechnum orientale L., Cyathea latebrosa (Wall. Ex. Hook) Copel, Cibotium barometz (L.) J. Sm., Drynaria quercifolia (L.) J. Sm. and Dicranopteris linearis (Burm.) Underwood var. linearis. Strong ion chelating activity was shown by Pteris vittata L. and Pteris venulosa Bl. Moderate tyrosinase inhibition activity was found in B. orientale and C. latebrosa, while antibacterial activities were exhibited by B. orientale, D. linearis and C. barometz. Five solvent extracts of B. orientale (BO) and C. barometz (CB) were prepared by suspending the respective methanolic crude extracts in water and successively extracting with petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate and butanol. HPLC and LC-MS analyses identified rutin, chlorogenic acid, kaempferol, caffeic acid, apigenin- 7, 4 -diglucoside, luteolin- 7 -rutinoside and luteolin triglycoside in BO, while rutin and esculin were found in CB. Bioactivities investigations showed that the ethyl acetate- (BOeaf), butanol- (BObutf) and water- (BOwatf) soluble extracts possessed strong radical scavenging (IC 50 8. 6 - 13. 0 µg/mL), antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Stapylococcus epidermidis (minimum bactericidal concentration MBC 15. 6 - 250 µg/mL) and selective cytotoxic activity against human colon cancer cells HT 29 (IC 50 27. 5 - 42. 9 µg/mL). Tyrosinase inhibition activities were strongest in BOeaf (70 % at 2. 5 mg/mL) and BOwatf (51 %). The water extract (BOwatf) {{was found to be}} safe (i. e. low toxicity) for oral consumption following an oral acute toxicity study. The traditional usage of BO in wound healing was verified in an in vivo study using the water extract, as revealed by the significant wound size reduction, mean epithelisation time and the increased collagen synthesis in the 2 % extract-treated group, compared with those of the vehicle-group. A polymeric proanthocyanidin (condensed tannins) and a flavan- 3 -ol were isolated from the <b>active</b> <b>solvent</b> extracts of BO. Spectroscopic analyses showed that the proanthocyanidin was a heterogeneous polymer possessing epicatechin subunits with 2 - 12 degree of polymerization and co-existing with minor units of epiafzelechin and epigallocatechin at C 4 -C 8 interflavanoid linkages. Bioactivity studies recorded strong radical scavenging activity (IC 50 5. 6 ± 0. 1 µg/mL), bactericidal activity and selective cytotoxicity towards colon cancer cells HT 29 (IC 50 7. 0 ± 0. 3 µg/mL). Further studies were conducted to assess the cytotoxic potential and apoptosis induction effects on HT 29. Cell death was found to be time and dose dependent. The induction of apoptosis was confirmed using fluorescence microscopy, FITC-Annexin V staining coupled with flow cytometry, caspase colorimetric assays and western blot analyses. The molecular mechanism underlying the apoptosis in the extract-treated HT 29 cells involved caspases - 3, - 6 and - 8. These results provided the first evidence of the apoptotic induction capability of the proanthocyanidins of B. orientale via an extrinsic-mediated pathway. The flavan- 3 -ol isolated was characterized as 4 β-carboxymethyl-(-) -epicatechin which possessed antioxidant potential (IC 50 14. 66 ± 0. 29 µM) comparable to that of ascorbic acid. The overall results indicate the promising potential of the proanthocyanidins of B. orientale as a natural therapeutic source to treat oxidative related medical health problems, for the chemotherapy of colon cancer and a source of bactericidal agent...|$|E

40|$|Many reduced cupredoxins {{undergo a}} pH-dependent {{structural}} rearrangement, triggered by protonation of the His ligand {{belonging to the}} C-terminal hydrophobic loop, usually termed the acid transition. At variance with {{several members of the}} cupredoxin family, the acid transition is not observed for azurin (AZ). We have addressed this issue by performing molecular dynamics simulations of AZ and four mutants, in which the C-terminal loop has been replaced with those of other cupredoxins or with polyalanine loops. All of the loop mutants undergo the acid transition in the pH range of 4. 4 - 5. 5. The main differences between AZ and its loop mutants are the average value of the <b>active</b> site <b>solvent</b> accessible surface area and the extent of its fluctuations with time, together with an altered structure of the water layer around the copper center. Using functional mode analysis, we found that these variations arise from changes in nonbonding interactions in the second coordination sphere of the copper center, resulting from the loop mutation. Our results strengthen the view that the dynamics at the site relevant for function and its surroundings are crucial for protein activity and for metal-containing electron transferases...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{enterovirus}} receptors are found {{mainly in the}} microsomal fraction of disrupted primate cells. Greater virus adsorption was exhibited by disrupted cells than by intact cells, indicating that enterovinis receptor may be present on intracellular membranes {{as well as on}} the surface of the cell. Polio-virus receptor is an integral part of, or is firmly attached to, the insoluble lipoproteins of the cell. All attempts to solubilize receptor have either destroyed virus-adsorbing activity, or have failed to separate it from sedimentable lipoproteins. The destruction of poliovirus receptor activity by proteolytic enzymes, surface <b>active</b> agents, organic <b>solvents,</b> concentrated urea solutions, phenol, formaldehyde, etc., all strongly indicate that this receptor function depends upon integrity of a protein portion of the membrane lipoproteins...|$|R
