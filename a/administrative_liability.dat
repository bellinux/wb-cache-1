Nonetheless, Constantino stated that the PNP Internal Affairs Service will investigate Dela Rosa's Facebook posts for possible <b>administrative</b> <b>liabilities</b> as the officers of the Philippine National Police are required to be neutral and apolitical during the elections.|$|R

40|$|Farm level {{coexistence}} measures between GM and non-GM {{crops are}} essential to ensure the freedom of choice of both producers and consumers that {{is the cornerstone of}} the European policy in this matter. However, it is important that these measures do not tip the balance over, and divert farmers from their initial choice. Based on a farm survey conducted in 2012, this article analyses the burden of coexistence measures as farmers perceived them. A total of 1403 farmers were interviewed in five European Member States. Results illustrate that farmers regard coexistence measures implying a restriction of their freedom of choice as the most burdensome, while they are less affected by practical coexistence measures at field level or by <b>administrative</b> rules. <b>Liability</b> for the damages to non-GM farmers is also considered extremely burdensome due to the rather unpredictable nature of the outcome of a potential court case. The burden of practical, field-level coexistence measures also varies across countries, depending on the agro-ecological conditions. This calls for the design of flexible, context-specific coexistence measures at field level, possibly complemented by non-production constraining administrative rules. According to the survey, few conflicts have arisen because of coexistence issues with neighbouring farmers. JRC. J. 4 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} my diploma thesis is {{to analyze the}} hunting {{legislation}} in the Czech Republic. The legislation regulates the hunt and game keeping as {{one part of the}} environmental law. It is also closely connected to administrative law. This thesis consists of eight chapters. First two chapters provide an introduction to historical traditions, principles and development of Czech hunting legislation. The Czech Republic {{is a member of the}} European Union, so the third chapter deals with the hunting legislation in the international and European context and describes the international cooperation between states. The most important international organizations protecting wildlife are also mentioned. The fourth chapter contains the analysis of the effective Hunting Law. This chapter provides legal definitions connected to game management and the division of the wild game. Divided into eight parts it describes the main areas of the hunting legislation. It focuses on the use of the hunting plots, rights of landowners, protection of game management and wild game. It also regulates liability of the owners of hunting plots to damages, criminal liability and liability according to the <b>administrative</b> law. <b>Liability</b> of the state for damages caused by especially protected animals is also regulated.

50|$|The Central Coast was {{the first}} to be designated, first to be {{violated}} and first to be successfully prosecuted. The SMR in Morro Bay Estuary is the recipient of two creeks that drain 75 square miles of the watershed, known as the Estero Bay Hydrologic Unit. One of these creeks (Chorro)hosts effluent from a habitual polluter upstream, the CMC (California Men's Colony State Prison). The SMR took effect in Sept 2007, and in Jan 2008, the CMC spilled sewage into Chorro Creek, which meandered into the State Marine Reserve portion of the Morro Bay Estuary. Working together, coastal activist Joey Racano, then-Gov Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board together successfully prosecuted the SMR violation by getting the ACL (<b>Administrative</b> Civil <b>Liability)</b> to reflect the violation was more than just another spill, but was a spill into an MPA (Marine Protected Area) into a no-take SMR. This set the precedent for all future violators, and for upstream violators (or violations from outside the SMR boundaries) as well as a precedent set for too much chlorine in the discharge. Due to the MPA violation, the CCRWQCB staff ordered the CMC to receive a higher fine than the original ACL had specified.|$|R

It has been determined that employers that provide illegal employment can be subject to <b>administrative</b> responsibility, criminal <b>liability,</b> and penalties. But, despite the available demotivators towards the illegal employment in the national legislation, its volume remains significant. Therefore we suggest the following activities to be necessary: informing citizens about the legal liability for illegal employment, activation of bodies of the State supervision and monitoring of violations of labor laws as well as working groups on legalization of the payment of wages and employment...|$|R
5000|$|The {{remaining}} Romance languages survive {{mostly as}} spoken languages for informal contact. National governments have historically viewed linguistic diversity as an economic, <b>administrative</b> or military <b>liability,</b> {{as well as}} a potential source of separatist movements; therefore, they have generally fought to eliminate it, by extensively promoting the use of the official language, restricting the use of the [...] "other" [...] languages in the media, characterizing them as mere [...] "dialects", or even persecuting them.

The issues of current legislation related to the abuse of law may be analysed {{in the light of the}} social role law has, especially from the viewpoint of its function of harmonization of the individual interests with the general ones. The concrete way to express the abuse of law is represented by the exercise of the subjective law beyond its legal limits as well as the pursuit of a goal in bad faith, but other goal than the one for which the law was consecrated. The role of legal liability for the abuse of law is represented by the legal relationship of constraint whose content consists in a plurality of rights and obligations of substantive or procedural law appearing as a result of commitment of some deeds non-compliant with the model prefigured by the legal norm by which the state is entitled to hold liable the one who exercised a subjective law in bad faith cumulated with the violation of the goal for which such law was consecrated and the guilty party is going to answer for their deed and to obey the sanctions provided under the law. This paper focuses on the conditions that must be met cumulatively, in the current legislation, so that the holder of a subjective law exercised abusively may become the subject of civil, contraventional, criminal, and <b>administrative</b> legal <b>liability,</b> etc...|$|R

50|$|<b>Administrative</b> <b>liability</b> in English law {{is an area}} of law {{concerning}} the tortious liability of public bodies in English law.

Therefore a public body which acts ultra vires is liable in tort is a cause of action can be established just like any individual would be. An ultra vires action will not, per se, give rise to damages Therefore a claimant will have to fit into one of the recognised private law courses of action. These areas in which a public body can incur private liability in tort were described by Lord Browne Wilkinson in X and others (minors) v Bedfordshire County Council 1995 3 All ER 353 (HL).|$|E
