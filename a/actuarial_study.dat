40|$|Abstract Introduction: The {{pacemaker}} implantation VDD is considered simpler, faster, {{less expensive and}} causes fewer complications compared to DDD. However, the VDD pacemaker has not been widely used in many centers, perhaps for fear of dysfunction of the sinus node and the reduction of atrial sensitivity by the pacemaker during follow-up after implantation. Objective: To compare patients with DDD and VDD pacemakers regarding the evolution of chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) and length of stay outside this postoperative arrhythmia. Methods: It was included 158 patients with dual chamber pacemakers, 48 DDD and 110 VDD. Follow-up period: between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2015. The mean follow-up of patients with DDD was 5. 35 years and the VDD, 4. 74 years. The percentage of each group (DDD and VDD) which evolved to AF during follow-up was assessed. Also, it was made an <b>actuarial</b> <b>study</b> with the respective curves indicating the time free from AF for each group. Patients were classified according to the diagnosis that led to {{pacemaker implantation}} {{and the degree of}} heart failure. Results: The percentage of patients who developed AF was higher in DDD group (10. 42 %) than in VDD group (6. 36 %), but without statistical significance. Patients with DDD and VDD remained free of AF for similar period. Conclusion: Considering the results, the VDD pacemaker continues to be a good option to the DDD for routine use in cases properly indicated...|$|E

OBJETIVOS: Avaliar a ocorrência de complicações em portadores de próteses valvares cardíacas mecânicas submetidos à terapêutica anticoagulante, otimizada por meio de ambulatório especializado. MÉTODOS: Estudou-se a ocorrência de complicações ao longo de 10 anos em 261 pacientes com próteses valvares cardíacas mecânicas, anticoagulados e acompanhados em ambulatório especializado. Esses pacientes foram divididos em dois grupos conforme porcentual de consultas com tempo de protrombina (RNI) dentro do intervalo desejado: G 1 - 0 % a 50, 00 % e G 2 - 50, 01 % a 100 % das consultas. Foram avaliadas as ocorrências de complicações tromboembólicas e hemorrágicas na sua totalidade, ou subdivididas em maiores e menores, de acordo com a gravidade. Os resultados estão apresentados sob forma de estudo atuarial e de frequência linearizada de ocorrência de eventos. RESULTADOS: O estudo atuarial mostrou que, ao longo do tempo, no grupo G 2 (com 50, 01 % a 100 % das consultas com a RNI no intervalo desejado) maior número de pacientes esteve livre da ocorrência de qualquer tipo de evento, de eventos hemorrágicos menores ou da elevação exacerbada da RNI. As frequências linearizadas de ocorrência, em todos os tipos eventos, também foram menores nos pacientes do grupo G 2. CONCLUSÕES: O tempo de permanência dentro do intervalo de anticoagulação desejado está diretamente relacionado com a ocorrência de complicações. Entretanto, mesmo com acompanhamento otimizado por meio de ambulatório especializado, apenas cerca de um terço dos pacientes apresentaram nível de anticoagulação adequado em mais da metade das consultas. BACKGROUND: Published {{data suggest}} that rates of thromboembolism and bleeding, in patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses, can be very small by optimizing current anticoagulant therapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the occurrence of complications in patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses undergoing anticoagulant therapy optimized through specialized clinics. METHODS: We studied the occurrence of complications over 10 years in 261 anticoagulated patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses, followed in specialized clinics. These patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to percentage of queries with prothrombin time (INR) within the desired range: G 1 - 0 % to 50. 00 % and G 2 - 50. 01 % to 100 % of appointments. We evaluated the occurrence of thromboembolic and bleeding complications in their entirety or subdivided into major and minor, according to gravity. The results are presented in an <b>actuarial</b> <b>study</b> and frequency of occurrence of linear events. RESULTS: The <b>actuarial</b> <b>study</b> showed that, over time, more G 2 (with 50. 01 % to 100 % of the consultations with INR in desired range) more patients were free of the occurrence of any event, of minor bleeding events or the marked increase of RNI. The linearized frequency of occurrence in all types events, were also lower in group G 2. CONCLUSIONS: The period of time that patients that remain within the desired anticoagulation interval has directly relations with occurrence of complications. Even with careful follow-up at a specialized outpatient unit, only approximately one third of the patients showed an adequate anticoagulation level in {{more than half of the}} consultations...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the occurrence and costs of medical errors from the hospital perspective. MethodsMethods from a recent <b>actuarial</b> <b>study</b> of medical errors were used to identify medical injuries. A visit qualified as an injury visit if at least 1 of 97 injury groupings occurred at that visit, and the percentage of injuries caused by medical error was estimated. Visits with more than four injuries were removed from the population to avoid overestimation of cost. Population estimates were extrapolated from the Premier hospital database to all US acute care hospitals. ResultsThere were an estimated 161, 655 medical errors in 2008 and 170, 201 medical errors in 2009. Extrapolated to the entire US population, there were more than 4 million unique injury visits containing more than 1 million unique medical errors each year. This analysis estimated that the total annual cost of measurable medical errors in the United States was $ 985 million in 2008 and just over $ 1 billion in 2009. The median cost per error to hospitals was $ 892 for 2008 and rose to $ 939 in 2009. Nearly one third of all medical injuries were due to error in each year. ConclusionsMedical errors directly impact patient outcomes and hospitals’ profitability, especially since 2008 when Medicare stopped reimbursing hospitals for care related to certain preventable medical errors. Hospitals must rigorously analyze causes of medical errors and implement comprehensive preventative programs to reduce their occurrence as the financial burden of medical errors shifts to hospitals...|$|E
40|$|In 2002, an asthma disease {{management}} program was initiated in Washington State in the US. The program {{was designed for}} clients of the state's Medicaid program, which provides health coverage for qualified low-income state residents. In response to the escalating cost of healthcare and {{because of concerns about}} the quality of care, the Washington State Legislature mandated implementation of this {{disease management}} program as a pilot project to assist individuals to improve their health. Medicaid administrators used a carefully designed process to identify client needs and to obtain proposals for disease management programs. The asthma program seeks to narrow the gap between the standards of care and its practice. In particular, the program aims to provide patients with a richer understanding of asthma and how to control it. This is accomplished through disease education, symptom awareness and management, trigger avoidance, self-monitoring, and education on recommended medication strategies. The program is based on the US National Institutes of Health's published guidelines on the optimal treatment of asthma. Enrollment of Medicaid clients into the asthma program began in April 2002. This article describes three approaches to evaluation of the first 3 years of the program: (i) 3 years of self-reported client data; (ii) an independent evaluation of the first year's changes in utilization and quality of care; and (iii) an actuarial analysis of cost effectiveness. The first study used vendor-reported data collected during initial and follow-up assessments. The authors of this first study also reported the results of a satisfaction survey conducted on behalf of the vendor. The independent evaluation conducted by the University of Washington relied on medical record review and claims analysis, and reported statistical analysis of pre/post comparisons. The <b>actuarial</b> <b>study</b> also reported pre/post comparisons using an analysis of claims per member per month in periods before the program started and at 1 and 2 years of program operations. Clients were assessed according to several dimensions of health including self-management, symptoms, functional status, medication management, and trigger management. Numerous interventions were provided to study participants including access to round-the-clock telephone consultation with a registered nurse, self-care education, alerts sent to the primary provider, and symptom issue follow-up. The asthma disease management program outcomes provide evidence of initial success for those clients who completed the reassessment process. The results of the first 3 years of participation in the program indicate trends toward improved health status and client satisfaction with the program. Long-term evaluation will be necessary to determine if the program reduces costs and closes the quality chasm. If successful, this program could {{serve as a model for}} programs with similar clients and similar challenges. Asthma, Disease-management-programme-evaluation, Disease-management-programmes...|$|E
40|$|Foram estudados 101 pacientes submetidos a plástica da valva mitral em seis anos, com seguimento de 100 %. Entre eles, 36 eram do sexo masculino e 65 do sexo feminino, com idade variando de dois a 62 anos (M = 28 ± 16, 4). Desses, 57 (56, 4 %) foram submetidos apenas a abordagem valvar mitral. Os demais foram submetidos a procedimentos associados, como plástica tricúspide (9, 9 %), revascularização do miocárdio (4, 0 %), entre outros. Não foi registrado óbito imediato. O índice de mortalidade tardia foi de 2 % (AVC hemorrágico após cinco anos e septicemia), no primeiro ano. As complicações não fatais foram representadas pela endocardite evidenciada em dois pacientes (2 %), sendo tratados e curados, e um paciente com reestenose mitral pós-plástica por reagudização da doença reumática. O estudo atuarial revelou um índice de 79, 0 ± 17, 7 % de sobrevida, um total de 76, 3 ± 17, 8 % de pacientes livres de complicações, 80, 0 ± 17, 9 % de reoperações, 100, 0 % livres de tromboembolismo. Os resultados ecodoplercardiográficos registraram que 89 % dos pacientes evoluíram com ausência de insuficiência. Dos 11 % restantes, 7, 4 % apresentram insuficiência mitral discreta, 2, 4 % moderada e 2 % importante. De acordo com a classificação da NYHA, os pacientes das classes III (83, 8 %) e IV (16, 2 %) passaram para as classes I (33, 3 %), II (60, 6 %), III (4, 1 %) e IV (2 %). Os autores concluem que o anel de pericárdio flexível conforma-se perfeitamente com o anel valvar, não produz hemólise e se endoteliza completamente a médio prazo. A hundred-and-one {{patients}} were studied in six years, with 100 % of follow-up. Among them, 36 were male and 65 female, with an age range {{of two to}} 62 years (mean 28 ± 16. 4 %). Fifty seven of them (56. 4 %) underwent just a mitral surgery, the others and other associated procedures, as tricuspid plastic (9. 9 %), coronary artery revascularization (4. 0 %), among others. Hospital mortality was not registered. The late mortality rate was 2 % for AVC hemorrhagic after five years, and septicemia during the first year. The non-fatal complications were represented by endocarditis in two patients (2 %), treated and cured; and a mitral restenosis after plastic. The <b>actuarial</b> <b>study</b> revealed a survival rate of 79. 0 ± 17. 7 % and rates of without complications, reoperation and thromboembolism of 76. 3 ± 17. 8, 80. 0 ± 17. 9 and 100 %, respectively. The echocardiography results registered 89 % of the patients with evolution to absence of insufficiency from the remaining 11 %, 7. 4 % showed discrete mitral insufficiency, 2. 4 % moderate and 1. 2 % important.
