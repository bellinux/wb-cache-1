25|$|On October 11, 2006, Lidle and {{his flight}} {{instructor}} crashed {{a small plane}} into a 50-story condominium tower on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Francesa and Russo quickly went on the defensive, as they were emotionally disturbed and upset {{by the death of}} Lidle, whom they had scolded on air two days prior. They also refused to take any phone calls for the first couple of days after the crash, which led many to speculate that they were <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> their callers would say. In fact, many of the other hosts during their shows received quite a number of phone calls lambasting Francesa and Russo.|$|E

[...] Adams also enjoyed the way the episode wrote Pam's reaction, noting [...] "is she generally uncomfortable, is she <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Meredith might assume, or is she afraid of her own feelings?" ...|$|E

50|$|Florence {{described}} her inspiration behind the song:I'd written all these dark songs, and the label suggested {{we should have}} something that was a bit more upbeat. In {{the process of trying}} to do that, I realised maybe I was sacrificing something. So I had a really upbeat piano and drums, but the lyrics that came out were 'This is the gift/It comes with a price/ Who is the lamb/And who is the knife?' The rabbit heart is a reference to fear. I'm so <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> about to happen. Of being in the spotlight.|$|R
500|$|Bono {{said he did}} {{not feel}} {{responsible}} that a U2 song was used in a murder defence, but stated [...] "I still feel that you have to go down those streets in your music. If that's where the subject is taking you, you have to follow. At least in the imagination. I'm not sure I want to get down there to live. I'll take a walk occasionally, and have a drink with the devil, but I'm not moving in with him." [...] The Edge said that the song's defence in the trial was [...] "very heavy", stating [...] "Should any artist hold back from putting out something because he's <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> somebody else might do {{as a result of his}} work? I would hate to see censorship come in, whether from the government or, from my point of view, personal." ...|$|E
500|$|The BBC Deputy Director General, Mark Byford, also {{defended the}} {{decision}} {{on the day of}} the programme, saying: [...] " [...] should have the right to be heard, be challenged, and for the public who take part in Question Time and the viewers to make up their own minds about the views of the BNP. It's not for the BBC to censor and say they can't be on". The BBC's chief political adviser, Ric Bailey, stated after the failed appeal that the BBC [...] "would have been breaking its charter if it had not treated the BNP with impartiality ... We absolutely stand by that judgement, even though there's obviously been a lot of controversy about it". A senior BBC presenter, John Humphrys, said the decision was [...] "absolutely right". He said: [...] "Why should we be <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they have to say? Free speech is the issue here, and the BBC's obligations." [...] However, broadcasting unions said some of its members would protest at the invitation.|$|E
500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he drove me wide. You could say he had the right to do that because he had the track position, but I think it was a deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide like that and I was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael and he is not <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> will happen if Michael does not lift." ...|$|E

The singer confessed that after Moody's {{departure}} she had nobody to hold her back {{in the writing process}} and that Balsamo was lifting her up and pushing her to do something she would not have done with Moody. Regarding this, Lee said, [...] "He's a great writer, and it was just like we were just having fun with it for a change. It was like, 'Let's stop taking everything so seriously and have fun,' and we wrote a lot of songs that I'm just totally in love with." [...] The singer further told The Sun, [...] " [...] got this sort of spooky, surreal element to his guitar writing [...] It’s really cool because it just works perfectly with what we do. He was really trying to create something so we were both discovering this new sound together and branching out [...] Writing with Terry was a unique experience in my life because I’ve never been able to just sit and write music with somebody and not be <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they would say." [...] Lee went on explaining that the making of the album was [...] "really intense" [...] and that she came out [...] "feeling purified" [...] while her writing partner, Balsamo, lifted her [...] "to a whole new level of inspiration and possibilities". She said it was only about [...] "writing great music".|$|E
