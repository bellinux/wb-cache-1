40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis is mainly concerned with measurements of the solubility <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> in heavy water and in formamide, at various chloride concentrations and temperatures, A radiochemical technique has been developed, whereby <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> is measured for its gamma-activity. The heat <b>of</b> precipitation <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> in formamide has also been measured at 15 and 25 C. The solubility data have been analysed to yield solubility products and equilibrium constants {{for the formation of}} complexes. The heats <b>of</b> solution <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> in heavy water and in formamide have been calculated from the temperature dependence of the solubility products. The value in heavy water is in close agreement with a published calorimetric figure The value in formamide is in satisfactory agreement with the present measured heat of precipitation. All of the heats of solution are endothermic; but are less endothermic in formamide than in water Other relevant thermodynamic quantities have also been calculated for comparison with the corresponding values in water. The results suggest that the amount <b>of</b> undissociated <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> is smaller in heavy water, but greater in formamide, than in water.

40|$|The {{photochemistry}} <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> {{and other}} <b>silver</b> halides has attracted intensive attention among researchers {{for the past}} twenty years, in part at least, because it is recognized as a promising technology for degradation of organic contaminants in waters and wastewaters. <b>Silver</b> <b>chloride</b> displays semiconducting properties and absorbs incoming photons in the UV-visible region with resultant formation of several highly reactive species and, in many instances, the degradation of organics, if organics are present. The fact that the actual reaction mechanism remains uncertain hinders its practical application. This thesis describes work investigating the photolysis <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> under various solution conditions relevant to real life environmental water systems and describes the photocatalytic decay of formic acid and rhodamine B induced by <b>silver</b> <b>chloride.</b> The impact <b>of</b> solution matrix on the formation, size, aggregation behaviour and stability <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> was also investigated by employing advanced analytical technologies including Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), SEM (STEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD), as well as spectrophotometry and spectrofluorimetry. These techniques allow determination of the concentration of species at micro- or nano- molar levels and particle sizes down to the nanometer size range. Kinetic modelling of the mechanism on photolytic activity <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> and its photocatalytic decomposition of formic acid was done with Matlab-Acuchem. The concentration change of formic acid was detected using a radioisotope-labelling technique coupled with scintillation counting. Results show that reactive species superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and singlet oxygen are generated through irradiation <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> colloid, {{as well as the}} generation of free chlorine and silver nanoparticles. The relative importance of these various species was influenced by the initial concentrations of Ag(I), Cl&# 150;,and bicarbonate {{as well as by the}} pH and the presence of oxygen. Simulation of laboratory results by kinetic modelling of the processes indicated that oxidation of Cl&# 150; by holes resulted in formation of Cl 0 while scavenging of photo-generated electrons by Ag(I) and O 2 led to the formation of Ag 0 and O 2 &# 149;&# 150; respectively. Results obtained indicate that holes are responsible for the oxidation of formic acid while for rhodamine B, reaction with holes and chlorine atoms was found to be responsible for its decay...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} divided into two parts, the {{development}} of a sensitive analytical technique for the estimation <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> and a study of the solubility <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> in methanol-water mixtures. The analytical technique uses an ion exchange resin to concentrate labelled silver ions from a saturated solution <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> <b>chloride,</b> followed by gamma counting with a Nal(Tl) well-type crystal. In order to evaluate the procedure the solubility <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> in water at various chloride concentrations at 25 °C and 45 °C was measured and the standard enthalpy of solution estimated from the temperature dependence of the solubility product. The results are in general agreement with published data. The adsorption <b>of</b> labelled <b>silver</b> on glassware has been examined and shown to be less significant at low specific activities. The solubility <b>of</b> <b>silver</b> <b>chloride</b> in 1 %, 10 % and 43. 12 % (w/w) methanol-water mixtures of various chloride concentrations and at 25 °C, 35 °C, 45 °C and has been measured, solubility products calculated and from their dependence on temperature the standard enthalpies of solution estimated. These are all endothermic and decrease as methanol content of the solvent is increased. The standard Gibbs free energies of solution have a zero temperature coefficient. The standard entropies of solution decrease with increasing methanol content of the solvent. The free energies of transfer from water to the various methanol-water mixtures are, except for 1 % methanol-water mixture, in reasonable agreement with the values obtained from the Born equation. Further agreement with the Born equation is shown by the linear dependence of logarithm of solubility product on the reciprocal of the dielectric constant at the different temperatures, although the results for pure water are inconclusive. The evidence provided by these thermodynamic quantities and the application of the Born equation has been shown to suggest strong bonding between the Ag+ and oxygen atoms in the methanol-water mixtures...|$|R
