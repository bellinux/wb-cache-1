5|$|Humpback whales were hunted {{as early}} as the 18th century. By the 19th century, many nations (the United States in particular), were hunting the animal heavily in the Atlantic Ocean {{and to a lesser extent}} in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The late-19th-century {{introduction}} of the explosive harpoon allowed whalers to accelerate their take. This, along with hunting in the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ocean</b> beginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations. During the 20th century, over 200,000 humpbacks were taken, reducing the global population by over 90%. North Atlantic populations dropped to as low as 700 individuals.|$|E

Foyn then purchased Cap Nor, made extensive repairs and after completion renamed the ship Antarctic. From 1893 the ship was deployed to the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ocean</b> for whale hunting.|$|E

25|$|The Southern Ocean, {{also known}} as the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ocean</b> or the Austral Ocean, {{comprises}} the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60°S latitude and encircling Antarctica. As such, it is regarded as the fourth-largest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean. This ocean zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters.|$|E
25|$|The marine {{invertebrate}} collection {{is composed of}} specimens from taxa other than crustaceans and molluscs. It includes Annelida, Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Cestoda, Cephalochordata, Hemichordata, Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Echinodermata, Echiura, Entoprocta, Nematoda, Foraminifera, Phoronida, Rotifera, Turbellaria, Trematoda, Urochordata, Porifera, Priapulida and Sipuncula. Specimens are mostly marine (Western Atlantic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ocean),</b> but some are neotropical freshwater and terrestrial. Containing nearly 200,000 lots and 200 type specimens, the collection was built with the efforts of late-19th-century researchers including Ernst and Eveline Marcus, Gilberto Righi, Luis Roberto Tommasi, Antonio Sérgio Ferreira Ditadi, Jeanete Maron Ramos, Gertrude Rita Kloss and Sérgio de Almeida Rodrigues.|$|E

25|$|The IHO readdressed the {{question}} of the Southern Ocean in a survey in 2000. Of its 68 member nations, 28 responded, and all responding members except Argentina agreed to redefine the ocean, reflecting the importance placed by oceanographers on ocean currents. The proposal for the name Southern Ocean won 18 votes, beating the alternative <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> Half of the votes supported a definition of the ocean's northern limit at 60°S (with no land interruptions at this latitude), with the other 14 votes cast for other definitions, mostly 50°S, but a few for as far north as 35°S.|$|E
25|$|The Hersilia {{departed}} from Stonington, Connecticut for the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Ocean</b> in July 1819. Over {{a decade later}} Edmund Fanning claimed that it was sent to go exploring the southern Pacific Ocean. However this has been challenged by later historians, who question Fanning's assertion. Sheffield served as its captain, W. Fanning as supercargo and Nathaniel Palmer as second mate. The Hersilia stopped in the Falkland Islands to procure much needed water and food supplies. It is uncertain the precise date the Hersilia reached the South Shetland Islands, but it was primarily stationed at Hersilia Cove on Rugged Island. An estimated 9,000 Antarctic fur seal {{were killed by the}} crew for their valuable pelts over the span of two weeks. Afterwards, the Hersilia returned to Stonington in early 1820.|$|E

In some habitats populations of phoronids reach tens of thousand of individuals per square meter.

The essentially Scottish character of the expedition was expressed in The Scotsman shortly before departure: [...] "The leader and all the scientific and nautical members of the expedition are Scots; the funds have been collected for the most part {{on this side of the}} Border; it is a product of voluntary effort, and unlike the expedition which will be simultaneously employed in the exploration of the Antarctic, it owes nothing to Government help".|$|E

5000|$|However, at {{the species}} level the {{geographical}} distribution {{is considered to}} be bipolar, as it occurs in both the Arctic and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>oceans.</b> Remigio and Hebert (2003) provided initial evidence for the genetic separation of Limacina helicina helicina and Limacina helicina antarctica. Hunt et al. (2010) have quantified genetic distance within these taxa. Hunt 2010 found a 33.56% difference in cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences between the [...] "Limacina helicina" [...] which were collected from the Arctic and the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>oceans.</b> This degree of separation is sufficient for ordinal level taxonomic separation in other organisms, and provides strong evidence for the Arctic and Antarctic populations of Limacina helicina differing at least at the species level. Subspecies Limacina helicina antarctica Woodward, 1854 can be considered as a separate species Limacina antarctica Woodward, 1854. A conservative divergence time estimate of 31 Ma (95% HPD interval 12-53 Ma) for Arctic and Antarctic taxa, indicates that they have undergone rapid independent evolution since the establishment of cold water provinces in the early Oligocene. Also there is different structure of the shell between Limacina helicina and Limacina antarctica.|$|R
