5|$|A {{radio galaxy}} is an <b>active</b> <b>galaxy</b> {{that is very}} {{luminous}} in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas. Active galaxies that emit shorter frequency, high-energy radiation include Seyfert galaxies, Quasars, and Blazars. Quasars {{are believed to be}} the most consistently luminous objects in the known universe.|$|E
5|$|An <b>active</b> <b>galaxy</b> is a {{formation}} that emits {{a significant amount}} of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It is powered by a compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.|$|E
5|$|Blazars are {{believed}} to be an <b>active</b> <b>galaxy</b> with a relativistic jet that is pointed in the direction of Earth. A radio galaxy emits radio frequencies from relativistic jets.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that the cosmic X-ray {{background}} (CXB) is not dominated by sources that are usual <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> or quasars. A comparable number of objects, young galaxies at z approximately 4 containing massive black holes surrounded by hot optically thin accretion disks, constitute the precursor <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> (PAG) postulated here for producing the thermal type spectrum required for the CXB. An evolutionary track for such PAG objects is described which {{would lead to the}} <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> observed as individual nonthermal sources. Unresolved emission from <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> at z 1 could then readily account for most of the nonthermal background observed in the gamma ray band...|$|R
40|$|Pointed IRAS {{observations}} of 20 <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{were examined in}} the first detailed search for far-infrared variability in a large sample of <b>active</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Less extensive survey data were also checked for evidence of strong 6 -month variability in 45 <b>active</b> <b>galaxies.</b> The far-infrared fluxes of three highly polarized objects ('blazars') appeared to vary by up to a factor of 2 on time scales of a few months. No convincing cases of variability greater than about 15 percent (rms) were found {{in any of the}} normal quasars or Seyfert galaxies studied. It appears that blazars tend to be variable at all wavelengths, but most <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> may be systematically less variable in the far-infrared than at higher frequencies...|$|R
5|$|A {{much larger}} galaxy cluster is the redshift-0.0354 Abell 2063. The cluster {{is thought to}} be {{interacting}} with the nearby galaxy group MKW 3s, based on radial velocity measurements of galaxies and the positioning of the cD galaxy at the center of Abell 2063. The <b>active</b> <b>galaxy</b> at the center of MKW 3s—NGC 5920—appears to be creating a bubble of hot gas from its radio activity. Near the 5th-magnitude star Pi Serpentis lies AWM 4, a cluster containing an excess of metals in the intracluster medium. The central galaxy, NGC 6051, is a radio galaxy that is probably responsible for this enrichment. Similar to AWM 4, the cluster Abell 2052 has central cD radio galaxy, 3C 317. This radio galaxy is believed to have restarted after a period of inactivity less than 200 years ago. The galaxy has over 40,000 known globular clusters, the highest known total of any galaxy as of 2002.|$|E
25|$|The VLT {{has also}} {{peered into the}} centre of galaxies beyond our own, where clear signs of {{activity}} produced by supermassive black holes are found. In the <b>active</b> <b>galaxy</b> NGC 1097, a complex network of filaments spiraling from {{the main part of}} the galaxy to its centre was seen in great detail.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{given the}} {{observed}} luminosity (which {{would be less}} than the Eddington luminosity), an approximate lower limit for {{the mass of the}} central black hole at the center of an <b>active</b> <b>galaxy</b> can be estimated. This derivation is a widely used approximation; but when the actual geometry of accretion discs is taken into account, it is found that the results can differ considerably from the classical value.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{observed}} spectrum of the diffuse gamma-ray background could {{be accounted for by}} unresolved <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> even with no evolution, if their spectra are described by a spherical accretion/shock acceleration model (1983) and are steepened by photon-photon pair production interactions at high energies. The model is based on HEAO- 1 and SAS- 2 observations in the region of 2 to 165 keV and above 30 MeV. The model predicts a higher flux of high-energy neutrinos from <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> than models in which electrons are accelerated directly. It is noted that several <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> should be detectable by the Gamma-Ray Observatory, making it possible to determine the actual contribution of <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> to the diffuse gamma-ray background...|$|R

25|$|Cygnus A is {{the first}} radio galaxy discovered; at a {{distance}} of 730 million light-years from Earth, it is the closest powerful radio galaxy. In the visible spectrum, it appears as an elliptical galaxy in a small cluster. It is classified as an <b>active</b> <b>galaxy</b> because the supermassive black hole at its nucleus is accreting matter, which produces two jets of matter from the poles. The jets' interaction with the interstellar medium creates radio lobes, one source of radio emissions.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, unified {{models were}} {{developed}} in which quasars were classified as {{a particular kind of}} <b>active</b> <b>galaxy,</b> and a consensus emerged that in many cases it is simply the viewing angle that distinguishes them from other classes, such as blazars and radio galaxies. The huge luminosity of quasars results from the accretion discs of central supermassive black holes, which can convert on the order of 10% of the mass of an object into energy as compared to 0.7% for the p-p chain nuclear fusion process that dominates the energy production in Sun-like stars.|$|E
25|$|This {{mechanism}} {{also explains}} why quasars were {{more common in}} the early universe, as this energy production ends when the supermassive black hole consumes all of the gas and dust near it. This means that it is possible that most galaxies, including the Milky Way, have gone through an active stage, appearing as a quasar or some other class of <b>active</b> <b>galaxy</b> that depended on the black hole mass and the accretion rate, and are now quiescent because they lack a supply of matter to feed into their central black holes to generate radiation.|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} the {{publicly}} available data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2 dF QSO Redshift Survey {{to test the hypothesis}} that QSOs are ejected from <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> with periodic non-cosmological redshifts. For two different intrinsic redshift models, namely the Karlsson (1 +z) model and Bell's decreasing intrinsic redshift (DIR) model, we do two tests respectively. First, using different criteria, we generate four sets of QSO-galaxy pairs and find there is no evidence for a periodicity at the predicted frequency in (1 +z), or at any other frequency. We then check the relationship between high redshift QSOs and nearby <b>active</b> <b>galaxies,</b> and we find the distribution of projected distance between high redshift QSOs and nearby <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> and the distribution of redshifts of those <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> are consistent with a distribution of simulated random pairs, completely different from Bell's previous conclusion. We also analyze the periodicity in redshifts of QSOs, and no periodicity is found in high completeness samples, contrary to the DIR model. These results support that QSOs are not ejected from <b>active</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Comment: 25 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R

25|$|Radio {{galaxies and}} their relatives, radio-loud quasars and blazars, are types of <b>active</b> <b>galaxy</b> {{that are very}} {{luminous}} at radio wavelengths, with luminosities up to 1039 W between 10MHz and 100GHz. The radio emission {{is due to the}} synchrotron process. The observed structure in radio emission is determined by the interaction between twin jets and the external medium, modified by the effects of relativistic beaming. The host galaxies are almost exclusively large elliptical galaxies. Radio-loud active galaxies can be detected at large distances, making them valuable tools for observational cosmology. Recently, much work has been done on the effects of these objects on the intergalactic medium, particularly in galaxy groups and clusters.|$|E
25|$|An {{active galactic nucleus}} (AGN) is {{a compact}} region {{at the center of}} a galaxy that has a much higher than normal {{luminosity}} over at least some portion—and possibly all—of the electromagnetic spectrum, with characteristics indicating that the excess luminosity is not produced by stars. Such excess non-stellar emission has been observed in the radio, microwave, infrared, optical, ultra-violet, X-ray and gamma ray wavebands. A galaxy hosting an AGN is called an <b>active</b> <b>galaxy.</b> The radiation from an AGN is believed to be a result of accretion of matter by a supermassive black hole at the center of its host galaxy. AGN are the most luminous persistent sources of electromagnetic radiation in the universe, and as such can be used as a means of discovering distant objects; their evolution as a function of cosmic time also puts constraints on models of the cosmos. The observed characteristics of an AGN depend on several properties such as the mass of the central black hole, the rate of gas accretion onto the black hole, the orientation of the accretion disk, the degree of obscuration of the nucleus by dust, and presence or absence of jets. Numerous subclasses of AGN have been defined based on their observed characteristics; the most powerful AGN are classified as quasars.|$|E
25|$|An {{active galactic nucleus}} (AGN) is {{a compact}} region {{at the center of}} a galaxy that has a higher than normal {{luminosity}} over portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. A galaxy having an active nucleus is called an <b>active</b> <b>galaxy.</b> Active galactic nuclei are the most luminous sources of electromagnetic radiation in the Universe, and their evolution puts constraints on cosmological models. Depending on the type, their luminosity varies over a timescale from a few hours to a few years. The two largest subclasses of active galaxies are quasars and Seyfert galaxies, the main difference between the two being the amount of radiation they emit. In a typical Seyfert galaxy, the nuclear source emits at visible wavelengths an amount of radiation comparable to that of the whole galaxy's constituent stars, while in a quasar, the nuclear source is brighter than the constituent stars by at least a factor of 100. Seyfert galaxies have extremely bright nuclei, with luminosities ranging between 108 and 1011 solar luminosities. Only about 5% of them are radio bright; their emissions are moderate in gamma rays and bright in X-rays. Their visible and infrared spectra shows very bright emission lines of hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and oxygen. These emission lines exhibit strong Doppler broadening, which implies velocities from , and are believed to originate near an accretion disc surrounding the central black hole.|$|E

40|$|We explore {{properties}} of barred <b>active</b> spiral <b>galaxies</b> in groups {{selected from the}} SDSS-DR 7, {{with the aim of}} assessing the effects of bars on AGN {{and the role of the}} high density environment. We identified barred <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> that reside in groups from SDSS-DR 7 group catalog. To provide a suitable quantification of the effects of bars, a reliable control sample of unbarred <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> in high density environments with similar redshift, magnitude, morphology, and bulge size distributions was constructed. We found that the fraction of barred AGN galaxies in groups (~ 38 %) is higher than those in the total barred AGN sample (~ 28 %), indicating that AGN spiral galaxies in groups are more likely to be barred than those in the field. We also found that barred AGN galaxies are more concentrated towards the group centers than the other unbarred AGN group members. In addition, barred AGN host galaxies show an excess of population dominated by red colors suggesting that bars produce an importanteffect on galaxy colors of AGN hosts. The host groups of the barred AGN exhibit a larger fraction of red colors than the host groups of the corresponding unbarred <b>active</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Color-magnitude relations of both host groups of AGN differ significantly: the host group colors of barred <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> display distributions spreading toward red populations, with respect to the host groups of the unbarred AGN objects. Barred <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> show an excess of nuclear activity compared to galaxies without bars. We found that barred <b>active</b> <b>galaxies</b> located farther from the group-center have stronger Lum[OIII]. Our findings suggest that the efficiency of bars to transport material towards the more central regions of the AGN galaxies in high density environments reveals an important dependence on the localization of objects within the group and on the host group colors.
