50|$|The {{doctorate}} {{has long}} {{existed in the}} UK as, originally, the second degree in divinity, law, medicine and music. But {{it was not until}} the late 19th century that the research doctorate, now known as the higher doctorate, was introduced. The first higher doctorate was the Doctor of Science at Durham University, introduced in 1882. This was soon followed by other universities, including the University of Cambridge establishing its ScD in the same year, the University of London transforming its DSc from an <b>advanced</b> <b>study</b> <b>course</b> to a research degree in 1885, and the University of Oxford establishing its Doctor of Letters (DLitt) in 1900.|$|E

At present, the Academy offers three-level programs, i.e. the two-year secondary specialized program, the four-year undergraduate program and the three-year <b>advanced</b> <b>study</b> <b>course.</b> There are 150 monastic students, 30 master teachers and 10 guest lecturers at the Academy. By the end of 2011, it had given over 1,400 graduation certificates and certificates of completion. A large number of young monks have emerged with a possession of moral integrity and ability, good character and knowledge. Some of them have committed themselves to teaching, some are engaged in Buddhist research, some are devoted to charity work, some have become abbots and some others have traveled abroad to promote Dharma.|$|E
5000|$|Research degrees first {{appeared}} in the UK in the late 19th century {{in the shape of the}} Doctor of Science (DSc or ScD) and other such [...] "higher doctorates". The University of London introduced the DSc in 1860, but as an <b>advanced</b> <b>study</b> <b>course,</b> following on directly from the BSc, rather than a research degree. The first higher doctorate in the modern sense was Durham University's DSc, introduced in 1882. This was soon followed by other universities, including the University of Cambridge establishing its ScD in the same year and the University of London transforming its DSc into a research degree in 1885. These were, however, very advanced degrees, rather than research-training degrees at the PhD level—Harold Jeffreys said that getting a Cambridge ScD was [...] "more or less equivalent to being proposed for the Royal Society".|$|E

On many of the Mediterranean Islands the demand for water exceeds the supply, a tendency that is going to worsen in view of anticipated climate change. How is this scarce resource going to be distributed among the many user groups: agriculture, tourism, private households and industry? How did previous generations deal with this problem, and what would be strategies for a sustainable and equitable water management in the future?

40|$|The general {{problem of}} this {{research}} is primary school teachers' communicative strategies in conflict situations with pupils. We are faced with more and more conflicts between teachers and pupils – in Slovene schools – which can, if they are unsuccessfully dealt with, deepen distrust in the teacher-student relationship and have a negative influence on the other aspects of the educational process as well. In the theoretical part of this thesis I presented the important theories and approaches which define the communicative process and also the importance of the communicative process in the school environment. I wrote about conflicts which may arise in primary schools as complex systems among various participating elements in them – where I was mostly interested in the teacher-student relationship – and the strategies for their solutions. In the empirical part of this thesis I followed the general problem {{of this research}} and tried to ascertain primary school teachers’ evaluations about the communicative strategies in conflict situations with pupils. I compared evaluations with the teachers’ evaluations of their own behaviour in concrete situations and offered guidelines for a successful way of solving such situations for the prevailing conflict situations. The chosen method {{of this research is}} a combination of quantitative empirical non-experimental research and qualitative techniques, where I have complemented the quantitative part of the research by paraphrasing and paraphrasing with associating. By doing that I exceeded the dichotomy between the quantitative and qualitative approach. Without joining the two of them meaningfully in non-experimental and often uncontrolled conditions such as a school, a scientific study of an individual or a phenomenon in a context would not be possible. I hope that these published results of this research will encourage primary schools head teachers and teachers to take part in supplementary expert <b>advanced</b> <b>study</b> <b>courses</b> dealing with communicative strategies for solving conflict situations...|$|R

40|$|In {{times of}} {{constant}} change in different fields of people’s lives, {{the special education}} teachers nowadays need continual professional development to confront successfully with numerous demands and challenges. Unpredictable working conditions, numerous demands and challenges often cause stress and the feeling of burnout, {{which can lead to}} exhaustion and the giving up of their profession. Therefore, the professional development of pedagogical workers has recently been focused on resilience. The purpose of the research was to find out the most breaking periods of special education teachers pursuing their professional path, what challenges and distress they are confronted with and what professional and personal effect these have on the teachers. In the research we were also interested in the protective factors, which indicate resilience. The empirical research, in which random samples were used, was based on the qualitative approach. Thirteen special education teachers, defectologists and teachers for children with special needs, having various working experience with different work time, were included in the research. The data were acquired by means of instructions for writing a vocational biography. They were categorized and processed by means of qualitative methods. The results of the research indicate that the professional development of special education teachers is marked by the following breaking periods: pre-diploma education and practice, training and professional exam, first employment or work experience, changing jobs or work places, breaking events, crisis and workload, professional progress, the ending of professional career. Special education teachers believe that stimulative work climate in school, their own inner motivation for learning and reading professional literature and continuous expert <b>advanced</b> <b>study</b> <b>courses</b> are the most important factors that affect their professional development. Among breaking events, that have enriched the special education teachers on their professional path, are those connected with children with special needs and their parents. The greatest challenge and distress respectively have been caused by events associated with co-workers, children with special needs and the demands and problems the teachers were facing {{at the beginning of their}} professional career. In moments of their greatest professional crisis, the special education teachers mention the family support and the support of their co-workers as important protective factors. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{academic}} year {{is divided into}} two semesters. The winter semester runs from October 1-March 31 and the summer semester from April 1-September 30. Online and self-study courses are held from mid-October to mid-February and mid-April to mid-July. Additionally, the University of Hagen offers presence classes and special seminars, some of which are required to graduate successfully. Students can generally begin their studies in the winter or in the summer semester. The standard time required to finish a Bachelor's degree's course load of 180 ECTS in full-time study is set at six semesters. The overall period of study for an undergraduate degree {{is divided into two}} parts: a period of basic <b>study,</b> equalling a <b>course</b> load of four semesters, {{at the end of which}} students must sit a formal examination, and a period of <b>advanced</b> <b>study,</b> equalling the <b>course</b> load of two semesters, after which students take their final examinations. Master's degrees, if done as full-time study, usually equalling the course load of four semesters. However, since a large proportion of the student body at the University of Hagen is studying in part-time, the regular study time can deviate but is not allowed to exceed a specific number of semesters. The normal duration of Ph.D. programs for full-time students is 6 semesters.|$|R
