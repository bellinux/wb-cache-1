2500|$|He {{landed at}} Bojnik near Radan Mountain, a {{position}} surrounded by Bulgars, Albanians, White Russians, and Germans. Through {{the latter part}} of August he, and his team back in Bari and Caserta, and the Partisans in Serbia and elsewhere, finalised the details of Ratweek. Almost to cue, the White Russians blew up their ammunition dump and the enemy started to retreat. The following day, Maclean moved to near Leskovac, and the next day, Ratweek began, with fifty heavy bombers attacking the town at 11:30. [...] "Already the Fortresses were over their target -- were past it -- when, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched,</b> the whole of Leskovac seemed to rise bodily into the air in a tornado of dust and smoke and debris,and a great rending noise fell on our ears. When we looked at the sky again, the Forts, still relentlessly following their course, were mere silvery dots in the distance. [...] Even the Partisans seemed subdued." [...] That night, the land offensive began, and Maclean watched the Partisans attack the Belgrade-Salonika railway, blowing up bridges, burning sleepers, and rendering it unusable. [...] When the Germans tried to repair it, the Balkan Air Force soon dissuaded them. They tried to evacuate Greece and Macedonia by air, but again the Allies thwarted them. Maclean, with three British companions and one Yugoslav guide, made his way on horseback north into Serbia. [...] They travelled for several days through prosperous countryside, [...] "so surprising after Bosnia and Dalmatia", where the peasants, who expressed great friendship for Britain and a certain caution about the Partisans, gave them lavish hospitality and food. One evening they camped outside a village, and soon saw [...] "a procession of peasant women arriving with an array of bowls, baskets, jars and bottles. From these they produced eggs and sour milk and fresh bread and a couple of chickens and a roast suckling-pig and cream cheese and pastry and wine and peaches and grapes". The journey produced many such vignettes, some pleasant, others of confusion, discomfort, worry. [...] Altogether Maclean found it [...] "an agreeable existence", reflecting [...] "with heightened distaste" [...] on the life he lived on Vis in the shadow of political negotiations. [...] He hoped he could remain in Serbia to be there when Belgrade was liberated, but received a message that Tito had disappeared—or as Churchill put it [...] "levanted"—and he had to try to find him. [...] A plane was sent to pick up Maclean.|$|E

One author wrote: [...] "Only gradually does it dawn upon us – <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> people draw near to this or that monument, strangely they appear to shrink; they are, of course, dwarfed by the scale of everything in the building.

50|$|Parreno’s {{most recent}} film, Anywhen {{was created for}} his Turbine Hall {{commission}} of the same name, which opened at the Tate Modern (London) on 4 October 2016. The film is a performance by actor and ventriloquist Nina Conti who speaks a monologue, her mouth not moving. As Conti speaks we see images of a bioluminescent cephalopod moving gracefully across the screen, almost dancing, and looking back at us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> the film.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} from a musical perspective by Richard Evidon, who paid Bergman the compliment of praising {{the film as}} a realization of Mozart's own vision (cf. Kael's comment above on the [...] "bewilderment" [...] of previous directors): [...] "Only Ingmar Bergman could have made this Magic Flute; but part of his achievement is in letting us forget the director's hand <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> and are drawn closer to Mozart's sublime work." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> it was {{possible}} to see that the man's arms were tied behind him, while it seemed as if his legs were fettered in some way; yet he was able to take short steps, and in his eagerness to make better speed he fell to the ground again and again, rising only with difficulty.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched,</b> {{our eyes}} wandered to the rolling Iss, which issued {{from the base}} of the cliffs beneath us.

"Three days more, and {{we shall}} reach the scene of our operations," [...] said Lumley to me, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> the slowly-rising flame which had just been kindled; [...] "is it not so?"

5000|$|Director's Quote: [...] "I am {{making this}} film {{out of love}} for my city and because I want to show its contradictions - its rising {{violence}} and invisible magic, {{and the story of}} our silence <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> our cities being conquered by oppression, ignorance and extremism. In Cairo, like in every other city in the Middle East, there is the feeling that we can’t keep going like this - the end is near, and it might be violent." ...|$|R

50|$|Brasyl {{is a story}} {{presented}} in three distinct strands of time. The main action concerns Marcelina Hoffman; a coked-up, ambitious reality TV producer in contemporary Brazil, a striving amateur capoeirista who transcends the cliches of luvvy television phony and becomes a full-fledged, truly likable person <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> her embark upon a mad new project. Marcelina {{is going to find}} the disgraced goalie who lost Brazil a momentous World Cup half a century before and trick him into appearing on television for a mock trial in which the scarred nation can finally wreak its vengeance.|$|R
60|$|He {{pointed to}} a smallish, dark, well-dressed man who was bustling along {{the other side of}} the road. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> him he looked across at a boy who was bawling out the latest edition of the evening paper, and running over among the cabs and busses, he bought one from him.

60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched,</b> they fed, fought, rose up and {{lay down}} in calm disdain of our presence.

Reluctantly, slowly we turned and rode away, back to our tent, back to the railway and the present day.|$|E
60|$|Across the gardens, {{from side}} to side, stood a {{wavering}} line of black warriors, while beyond them and forcing them ever back was a great horde of green warriors astride their mighty thoats.

6000|$|The exaltation, the sin, and the {{punishment}} of Tyre have been recorded for us, in perhaps the most touching words ever uttered by the Prophets of Israel against the cities of the stranger.

5|$|Stefano Ghislotti {{wrote an}} article in Film Anthology which {{discusses}} how Nolan provides the viewer with the clues necessary to decode the sujet <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> and {{help us understand the}} fabula from it. The color sequences include a brief overlap to help clue the audience into {{the fact that they are}} being presented in reverse order. The purpose of the fragmented reverse sequencing is to force the audience into a sympathetic experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories, where prior events are not recalled, since the audience has yet to see them.|$|R
50|$|Christopher Robin {{presents}} Pooh with {{an interesting}} new gift—a calendar. Pooh {{has never seen}} one before, and Christopher Robin explains that it's {{a way of keeping}} track of the days, weeks, months and seasons. The calendar stops at each season, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, Rabbit and Owl in the Hundred Acre Wood exploring the world around them and noticing the changes. Among them: the water in the pond becomes hard and slick when it gets cold in the winter and becomes refreshing and fun to swim in when it gets warm in the summer.|$|R
