5|$|European {{banks are}} {{estimated}} to have incurred losses approaching €1 trillion between {{the outbreak of the}} financial crisis in 2007 and 2010. The European Commission approved some €4.5 trillion in state aid for banks between October 2008 and October 2011, a sum which includes the value of taxpayer-funded recapitalisations and public guarantees on banking debts. This has prompted some economists such as Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman to note that Europe is not suffering from a sovereign debt crisis but rather from <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> crisis.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, Banks {{worked for}} Seaway National Bank in the {{off-season}} and enrolled in <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> correspondence course. He bought into several business ventures, including a gas station, during his playing career. Though he had been paid modestly in comparison to other baseball stars, Banks had taken the advice of Wrigley and invested much of his earnings. He later spent time working for an insurance company and for New World Van Lines. Banks began building assets that would be worth an estimated $4million {{by the time he}} was 55 years old.|$|E

He played for the cricket club for four seasons, but was never consistently selected in the first XI. Wilson's most notable performances for the MCC were the final match of the 1892–93 season when {{he was part of}} a last-wicket partnership that secured the premiership for Melbourne and a match against a touring English XI where he took the wickets of three Test cricketers.|$|E
5|$|France even {{linked the}} issue of the seat to the ongoing dispute {{regarding}} the seat of the European Parliament. Frankfurt was criticised as symbolising German dominance, although the Deutsche Bundesbank had effectively been running the Communities currencies for the previous years, while Luxembourg has <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> tradition that wasn't so careful. London was discredited because the UK remained outside the eurozone. It was also seen as important to locate the bank in a city not already hosting a national government or EU institution, in order to emphasise its independence. Others, such as {{the former head of the}} Bundesbank Karl Otto Pöhl, favoured a small country with a stable currency. The advantages of hosting the Bank were also in dispute by some economists. While there was seen by some as little to gain in terms of attracting other banks and financial institutions, others saw it as affecting which cities would be financial hubs in the years to come.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>bank</b> run is {{mass action}} with {{sweeping}} implications.

5|$|It {{has long}} been a matter of debate why the Renaissance began in Florence, and not {{elsewhere}} in Italy. Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement. Many have emphasized the role played by the Medici, <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> family and later ducal ruling house, in patronizing and stimulating the arts. Lorenzo de' Medici (1449–1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the leading artists of Florence, including Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, and Michelangelo Buonarroti. Works by Neri di Bicci, Botticelli, da Vinci and Filippino Lippi had been commissioned additionally by the convent di San Donato agli Scopeti of the Augustinians order in Florence.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{newly elected}} {{government}} in Greece revealed the falsification of its national budget data, {{and that its}} fiscal deficit for the year was 12.7% of GDP {{as opposed to the}} 3.7% espoused by the previous administration. This news alerted markets to the fact that Greece's deficit exceeded the eurozone's maximum of 3% outlined in the Economic and Monetary Union's Stability and Growth Pact. Investors concerned about a possible sovereign default rapidly sold Greek bonds. Given Greece's prior decision to embrace the euro as its currency, it no longer held monetary policy autonomy and could not intervene to depreciate a national currency to absorb the shock and boost competitiveness, as was the traditional solution to sudden capital flight. The crisis proved contagious when it spread to Portugal, Italy, and Spain (together with Greece these are collectively referred to as the PIGS). Ratings agencies downgraded these countries' debt instruments in 2010 which further increased the costliness of refinancing or repaying their national debts. The crisis continued to spread and soon grew into a European sovereign debt crisis which threatened economic recovery {{in the wake of the}} Great Recession. In tandem with the IMF, the European Union members assembled a €750 billion bailout for Greece and other afflicted nations. Additionally, the ECB pledged to purchase bonds from troubled eurozone nations in an effort to mitigate the risk of <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> system panic. The crisis is recognized by economists as highlighting the depth of financial integration in Europe, contrasted with the lack of fiscal integration and political unification necessary to prevent or decisively respond to crises. During the initial waves of the crisis, the public speculated that the turmoil could result in a disintegration of the eurozone and an abandonment of the euro. German Federal Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble called for the expulsion of offending countries from the eurozone. Now commonly referred to as the Eurozone crisis, it has been ongoing since 2009 and most recently began encompassing the 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|When {{the stadium}} was profitable, Modell had used Stadium Corp. to buy land in Strongsville {{that he had}} {{previously}} acquired as the potential site for a future new stadium. Modell originally paid $625,000 for the land, but sold it to his own Stadium Corp. for more than $3 million. Then, when the stadium was taking losses in 1981, he sold Stadium Corp. itself to the Browns for $6 million. This led to a fight the following year with Bob Gries, whose family {{had been part of}} the Browns' ownership group since its founding and had 43% of the team to Modell's 53%. Gries's complaint was that Modell treated the Browns and Stadium Corp. as his own fiefdom, rarely consulting him about the team's business. The sale of Stadium Corp. to the Browns, he argued, enriched Modell at the team's expense. Gries's case went to the Ohio Supreme Court, where he won. In 1986, Modell had to reverse the Browns' purchase of Stadium Corp. and pay $1 million in Gries's legal fees. This left Modell in need of financial help, and it came in the form of Al Lerner, <b>a</b> <b>banking</b> and real estate executive who bought half of Stadium Corp. and 5% of the Browns in 1986.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{explored}} {{the structure and}} implications of interbank networks in pre-war Japan, focusing on director interlocking. It was found that approximately 60 % of the banks {{had at least one}} connection with another bank through director interlocking. These connections resulted in the construction of complex networks of banks, not to be reduced to core-periphery structures. Based on this finding, the impact of the interbank networks on the financial performance and the survivability of banks was examined. It was revealed that while <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> with <b>a</b> network was not always more profitable compared to <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> without it, <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> which had <b>a</b> network with profitable banks was more profitable. Concerning the probability of failure, it was found that <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> with <b>a</b> network was less likely to fail than <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> without one. In this case as well, the failure probability of <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> was negatively associated with the profitability of the connected banks. In addition, interbank networks affected on <b>bank</b> mergers. Namely, <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> tended to choose <b>a</b> <b>bank</b> in the same network as a counterpart of the merger, which suggests that interbank networks played a role in coordinating bank mergers. ...|$|R
