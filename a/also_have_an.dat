5|$|Following {{completion}} of the game, the player will obtain a New Game Plus option. The North American and European releases of Crisis Core <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> added difficulty mode, which increases the power and health of enemies.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{excellent}} {{sense of}} touch. The octopus's suction cups {{are equipped with}} chemoreceptors so the octopus can taste what it touches. Octopus arms do not become tangled or stuck to each other because the sensors recognise octopus skin and prevent self-attachment.|$|E
5|$|Starfish <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> unusual {{ability to}} expel foreign objects from their bodies, {{which makes them}} {{difficult}} to tag for research tracking purposes.|$|E

5|$|Both the Bagabo and the B’laan {{refer to}} their agung {{ensemble}} as a tagunggo, {{a set of}} eight metal gongs suspended on a harness, which is played by two, three, or more people. Seven of the smaller-sized gongs produce a running melody with the eighth, largest gong playing syncopation with the other gongs to produce a particular rhythm. The Manabo <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> agung ensemble similar to the tagunggo, called a tagungguan.|$|E
5|$|For the {{purposes}} of monitoring of water quality the Brue and Axe are considered together. In 2013 19 water bodies within the area were considered to have moderate water quality with two being poor and four good quality. Agriculture and rural land management is the largest factor affecting water quality followed by the water industry. Transport, industry and manufacturing <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile {{birds of}} both sexes have less {{extensive}} blue on their faces, the coloration not extending past the eye. The upperparts resemble those of the adult female. Both sexes have the white wing-stripe, which disappears with maturity in males. The immature male has a red patch on the wing and may <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> orange wash on the belly.|$|E

5|$|Outside North America it {{is subject}} to hunting for food or because of its liking for rice, and {{persecution}} means {{that it is now}} rare in Madagascar. Pesticides used on rice fields may <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> adverse impact, causing liver and breast muscle damage even at sub-lethal levels.|$|E
5|$|The notability {{of there}} being four captains in just five Test matches can better be {{understood}} with context. The captain of a cricket team performs a vital role. Unlike many other team sports, the captain makes crucial decisions regarding on-field tactics, and may <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> important say in team selection. Traditionally, captains of international teams are not changed frequently – for example, between 1977 and 1988 (comprising 104 Test matches), only seven different men captained England, yet {{there were four}} captains {{in just a few}} weeks in the summer of 1988.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the great}} rarity of odd–odd nuclei, almost all the {{primordial}} isotopes of the alkali metals are odd–even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived radioisotope potassium-40). For a given odd mass number, there can be only a single beta-stable nuclide, since {{there is not a}} difference in binding energy between even–odd and odd–even comparable to that between even–even and odd–odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number (isobars) free to beta decay toward the lowest-mass nuclide. An effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements. Of the 26 monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> even number of neutrons. Beryllium is the single exception to both rules, due to its low atomic number.|$|E

5|$|The Environment Agency is {{responsible}} for monitoring water quality on the river and its tributaries, which have been divided into seventeen separate water bodies. In 2013, seven water bodies were assessed as having good quality and ten as being moderate. The reasons for not achieving good status included pollution from waste water, pollution from agriculture and physical modifications. The physical modifications include dredging work on the lower reaches, near the junction with the Parrett to increase the channel flow to reduce flooding. The use and storage of the dredged material in bank restoration may <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> impact. In 1998 improvements were sought to treatment works and surface water outfalls to improve water quality. A vegetable washing plant on the Chelston stream at Wellington was also identified {{as a source of}} pollution. The waters of the Upper Tone have been classified as having good ecological status, whereas the section from Wellington to Taunton and downstrean of Taunton are rated as moderate.|$|E
5|$|The Tiruray {{call their}} agung {{ensemble}} a kelo-agung, kalatong, or karatung. It {{is made up}} of five shallow bossed gongs of graduating size, each played by one person. The smallest, the segaron, is used as the lead instrument, providing a steady beat. The Manobo sagabong ensemble follows a similar format, consisting of five small gongs, each held by one musician playing a unique pattern with rubber mallets, interlocking with other parts. The T’boli and Palawan have similar agung ensembles: the T’boli ensemble is composed of three to four agungs with two to three of them collectively called semagi which play variations, and the other agung, tang, providing a steady beat. The Palawan call their ensemble, composed of four gongs, a basal. It includes one to two large humped, low-sounding agungs and a pair of smaller humped, higher-pitched sanangs which produce metallic sounds. The Subanon <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> agung ensemble similar to the Tiruray karatung, called a gagung sua.|$|E
5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of A. atacis {{is a group}} of three connected dorsal vertebrae. Cervical vertebrae are uncommon from Bellevue {{and most of them are}} poorly preserved. The vertebrae are opisthocoelous, with centra that lengthen toward the rear. Neural spines have been preserved on the vertebrae, and they face toward the rear. Two dorsal vertebrae were preserved with a complete, but very crushed neural arch, a neural spine with a characteristic shape: it is very widened distally and narrows downwards. The vertebrae <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> internal structure that is spongy, with very large cells. The caudal vertebrae are all strongly procoelous and are compressed on the sides. The neural spines of the caudal vertebrae are very narrow and very tall and point toward the rear. The middle caudal vertebrae are more compressed on the sides that the others. Also, the centrum of middle caudal vertebrae is longer proportionally. Two sacral vertebrae were known from Bellevue. They are poorly preserved, and are thought to belong to a juvenile. A complete sacrum was also found in 2002.|$|E

5|$|There are 21 {{counties}} in New Jersey. These counties together contain 565 municipalities, or administrative entities composed of clearly defined territory; 250 boroughs, 52 cities, 15 towns, 244 townships, and 4 villages. In New Jersey, a county {{is a local}} level of government {{between the state and}} municipalities. County government in New Jersey includes a Board of Chosen Freeholders, sheriff, clerk, and surrogate (responsible for uncontested and routine probate), all of which are elected officials. Counties organized under the Optional County Charter Law may <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> elected county executive. Counties traditionally perform state-mandated duties such as the maintenance of jails, parks, and certain roads. The site of a county's administration and courts is called the county seat.|$|E
5|$|Two eastern North American species, C.inedulis and C.roseipes, <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{appearance}} {{similar to}} C.calopus. C.inedulis produces smaller fruit bodies {{with a white}} to greyish-white cap, while C.roseipes associates solely with hemlock. C.firmus, found in the eastern United States, eastern Canada, and Costa Rica, has a pallid cap colour, reddish stipe, and bitter taste, but unlike C.calopus, has red pores and lacks stipe reticulation. C.panniformis, a Japanese species described as new to science in 2013, bears a resemblance to C.calopus, but can be distinguished by its rough cap surface, or microscopically by the amyloid-staining cells in {{the flesh of the}} cap, and morphologically distinct cystidia on the stipe.|$|E
