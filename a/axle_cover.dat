5000|$|... 2013 models {{move up to}} an 18-inch {{standard}} wheel, with 18 inch forged Alcoa wheels as {{an option}} (300.00 USD). 3500 models offer a High Output package for $2650.00 USD over the standard diesel package. The rear differential ring gear is increased from 11.5 inches, to 11.8 inches on H.O. trucks. The 11.8 <b>axle</b> <b>cover</b> doubles as a heat sink.|$|E

50|$|Wingfoot Express' cockpit {{was located}} centrally, {{just behind the}} front <b>axle,</b> <b>covered</b> with an acrylic glass canopy from {{in front of the}} driver's feet to behind his head. The front wheels were mounted within the {{bodywork}} barely further apart than the width of the engine, while the rear wheels were on outriggers and exposed to the air. Green estimated that the aerodynamic drag of the exposed rear wheels cost the car 20 mph, but since his calculations indicated that they already had much greater speed available than they needed, this was not viewed as a problem. A small fin rose vertically {{at the tip of the}} car's nose.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the leading Bissel truck necessitated certain {{proportions}} to suit the ten-coupled wheel arrangement, but the trailing Bissel truck {{was similar to that}} of the Class 19C. Its axle boxes were provided with end thrust pad bearings attached to the <b>axle</b> box <b>covers,</b> which relieved the ends of the bearing from the effects of end thrust. This device proved successful in reducing the number of hot boxes on trailing Bissels.|$|R
30|$|Because a {{large number}} of {{calculations}} (considering geometry and panel types, different depth of <b>cover,</b> <b>axle</b> loads, and loading patterns) were required to determine the preliminary new pattern of the minimum depth of cover, a 2 D idealization was initially used to reduce the computing power and time required to perform the analyses. A 3 D idealization was then used to control the out-of-plane buckling in the corrugated steel plates, to check the applicability of the 2 D-based equations of minimum cover in practical 3 D problems.|$|R
500|$|The {{town was}} {{authorised}} to tender construction and operation {{to one or}} more contractors. It quickly chose the only serious candidate, Gustav Palmer Harding, a British citizen. He was the continental representative of Merryweather & Sons, builders of steam tram engines. This decision knitted the close railway links between the city and Great Britain that remained for nearly half a century. Naturally, Mr Harding wanted to promote his company's machines, so he long made his views known to the municipal authorities. Finally convinced, they authorised him to use steam power from Maromme (Line 1), entering service on 29 December 1877. Merryweather & Sons, whose depot was on the Avenue du Mont-Riboudet, provided the tram units. Small and light — [...] — these reversible locomotives had two coupled <b>axles,</b> fully <b>covered</b> by a wooden body. They looked the same as a normal carriage so as not to frighten the horses. These steam carriages had enclosed lower decks; the upper decks were roofed but had open sides.|$|R
50|$|The {{dimensions}} of the Solar Resource include a height of 1.04 metres, a width of 2 metres and a depth of 5.43 metres, with a total weight of 170 kg. It is powered by an electric motor that is Swiss-made, which has a variable drive, chain drive to its rear wheels. Built around a square tube frame, the body is set very {{low to the ground}} and is square in section, but with a rounded nose, which features four holes for ventilation. The cockpit cover is made of removable fibreglass, while the body panels are made of fibreglass, mylar and Kevlar. Attached to the roof, just above the tinted windscreen, is an externally mounted rear-view mirror which functions {{in the same manner as}} a ‘periscope’. The pneumatic tyres have four orange-coloured lights in each corner of the ‘hubcap’ which act as indicators. The <b>axles</b> are <b>covered</b> with white aerofoil and extend out from the body; the two front axles extend out further than the two rear ones.|$|R

5000|$|The Audi e-tron is {{a version}} of the R8 Coupé with a {{slightly}} smaller body, four electric motors rated [...] and 450 Nm of torque. However the proposed torque rating is the torque measured at the wheels, not at the output shaft — as is the industry standard, the true torque rating being around 678 Nm. Other features include 42.4 kilowatt hours lithium-ion battery, needs-based energy management system, LED technology used for all lighting units, independent cooling system for each <b>axle,</b> doors, <b>covers,</b> sidewalls and roof in fiber-reinforced plastic; 3-mode flush gear selector (forward, reverse and neutral), instrument cluster with fold-out central display with integrated Audi MMI functions, climate control unit located to the right above the steering wheel, racing-inspired lightweight bucket seats, snow white and cognac interior colours, heat pump, climate control system, triangular double wishbones at the front axle and trapezoidal wishbones made of forged aluminum components at the rear axle, direct rack-and-pinion steering with speed-sensitive electromechanical steering boost, 235/35R19 front and 295/30R19 rear tires with a new blade design, prototype of an information processing system (car-to-x communication).|$|R
50|$|The Mark 1 was {{initially}} offered with a 2.4 Litre short-stroke {{version of the}} XK120's twin-cam six-cylinder engine, first rated at 112bhp nett by the factory at the launch in 1955. From February 1957 the larger and heavier 3.4 Litre 210bhp (gross) unit already used in the Jaguar Mark VIII also became available, largely in response to pressure from US Jaguar dealers. Wire wheels became available. The 3.4 had a larger front grille for better cooling, a stronger rear <b>axle,</b> and rear-wheel <b>covers</b> (spats) were cut away to accommodate the wire wheels' knock-off hubcaps. The 2.4 Litre was also given the larger grille. After 200 cars had been built and sent to USA and {{just prior to the}} car's announcement a major factory fire destroyed 3.4 Litre production facilities. See also Jaguar XKSS.|$|R
50|$|Another type is the roll-up or rolling shutter, {{consisting}} {{of a series of}} slats that form a curtain with both sides of the curtain being inserted into guide rails. The curtain is then rolled onto an <b>axle</b> which is <b>covered</b> by a housing. Rolling shutters can be operated manually by gear, by pull strap or can be motorized independently or in conjunction with a manual override. Motorized shutters can be operated by either a switch or remote and can be controlled either individually or in groups. On loss of power caused by hurricanes, motorized shutters must be operated manually, requiring either access to the motor (which can be difficult) or a pre-installed manual override. Most often, a manual override is operated using a gear. When deployed, all hurricane shutters require special techniques for firefighters {{to gain access to the}} interior of a structure.|$|R
40|$|The author {{presents}} {{a conceptual framework}} for road pricing based on a rigorous diagrammatic - but nonmathematical - framework derived from first (economic) principles. His analysis of traditional arguments about road pricing shows why implementing congestion pricing as practiced {{in the past has}} encountered obstacles. Partly, it is because both types of road users - the tolled and the tolled off (those who avoid the road to shun a toll) - are shown to be worse off under a constant value of time, except for the government. And when differences in time valuation are taken into account, primarily those with very high time values are better off. Unless congestion toll revenues are earmarked and travelers perceive that the money is channeled back in reduced taxes, lower user charges, or improved transport services, neither the tolled nor the tolled off will support road pricing. Only where there is hypercongestion is everyone better off with congestion pricing. In the absence of scale economies or diseconomies, the level of economic profits - toll revenue collections less a road's fixed and non-use-related costs - serves as a surrogate market mechanism indicating that a road should be expanded or downsized. The decision to let roads deteriorate over time is itself an act of disinvestment. The author shows that if a road authority levies economically efficient charges for congestion, it is possible to make money on a road. Roads can be profitable in urban areas in the long run because land rents are high; congestion tolls reflect the associated high opportunity costs. On urban roads with indivisibilities and diseconomies of scale, efficient pricing may curtail the extent of profitable undertakings. On rural roads with indivisibilities and economies of scale, marginal cost pricing can produce short-run profits. Economic efficiency is enhanced by pursuing optimal pricing in the short run and optimal investment in capacity in the long run. The rule is to implement short-run marginal cost pricing while varying road capacity over the long run. Insights by Newbery, Small, and Winston - about the economic implications of the extensive damage that heavy vehicles cause to roads - enrich the basic Mohring model. Charging for both the external and variable cost of road damage, by assigning a fee based on vehicle weight per <b>axle,</b> can help <b>cover</b> deficits arising from road congestion. Even if a road network is broadly characterized by increasing returns to scale in building and strengthening roads, the deficit could be closed by diseconomies of scope. A road network that accommodates both cars and trucks costs {{more than the sum of}} an autos-only and a (smaller) trucks-only road system. So the surplus associated with diseconomies of scope offsets the potential loss associated with scale-specific economies. A dedicated road or transport fund is all the more viable because road users are charged not only for the damage caused by trucks and heavy vehicles but also for congestion.
