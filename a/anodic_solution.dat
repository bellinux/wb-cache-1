This study focused on water transport and biofilm formation on carbon papers with different characteristics: hydrophobicity, thickness, and presence of a micro porous layer (MPL).

The carbon papers with low hydrophobicity had complete penetration of biofilms and higher water transport, while those with high hydrophobicity and MPL had no biofilm penetration and lower water transport, indicating a clear correlation of biofilm penetration and water transport across carbon papers. Salt precipitation on carbon papers clogged the pores and resulted in lower water transport.

5000|$|The {{electrolysis}} {{occurs in}} a specially designed reactor which allows {{the separation of the}} cathodic and <b>anodic</b> <b>solutions.</b> In this process, hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions can be produced at the cathode, leading to an alkaline solution that consists essentially of sodium hydroxide. At the anode, chloride ions can be oxidized to elemental chlorine, which is present in acidic solution and can be corrosive to metals. If the solution near the anode is acidic then it will contain elemental chlorine, if it is alkaline then it will comprise sodium hydroxide. The key to delivering a powerful sanitising agent is to form hypochlorous acid without elemental chlorine - this occurs at around neutral pH. Hypochlorous is a weak acid and an oxidizing agent. This [...] "acidic electrolyzed water" [...] can be raised in pH by mixing in the desired amount of hydroxide ion solution from the cathode compartment, yielding a solution of Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). A solution whose pH is 7.3 will contain equal concentrations of hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ion; reducing the pH will shift the balance toward the hypochlorous acid. At a pH between 5.5 and 6.0 approximately 90% of the ions are in the form of hypochlorous acid. In that pH range the disinfectant capability of the solution is more effective than regular sodium hypochlorite (household bleach).|$|R

We have tested whether EW(+) can inactivate Staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), one of the major enterotoxins responsible for food poisoning. Fixed quantities of SEA were mixed with increasing molar ratios of EW(+), and SEA was evaluated by reversed-phase passive latex agglutination (RPLA) test, immunoassay, native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and amino acid analysis after 30 min incubations. Exposure of 70 ng, or 2. 6 pmol, of SEA in 25 μL of PBS to a 10 -fold volume of EW(+), or ca. 64. 6 × 103 -fold molar excess of HOCl in EW(+), caused a loss of immuno-reactivity between SEA and a specific anti-SEA antibody.

Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) had several problems that hindered {{the technology to}} achieve the real world applications. Low power generation, low organic compounds removal and especially high electrode costs relegate the MFC technology still in lab-scale applications. A reduction of costs has been achieved with the membrane removal in a single chamber membraneless air-cathode microbial fuel cell (SCMFC) system. Even if the platinum is the best-known catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction, facing the <b>anodic</b> <b>solution</b> due to the membrane removal, the catalyst is easily poisoned by the organic substances naturally present in the wastewater.

Power curves measurements were necessary in order to compare the MFC systems and electrochemical LSV were used to compare different electrodes (structure and compositions) separately. Microbiological analysis was also conducted in order to confirm the results obtained by the electrochemical tests. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal measurements were used to study the organic compounds degradation in the MFC system over time. Particularly, the proposed research aims to improve the cathode structure, reduce the platinum loading (and consequently the costs), use the biofilm as bio-catalyst and at last use enzyme as catalyst in order to increase the cathode reaction, power generation and organic compounds removal. The results showed that: firstly, the addition of the micro porous layer (MPL) between the catalyst layer and the carbon cloth and the removal of the external PTFE layers increased significantly SCMFC output and organics removal due to a better oxygen penetration to the cathode catalyst. Secondly, the reduction in platinum loadings at the cathode of 2 orders of magnitude (from 0. 5 to 0. 005 mgPt/cm 2) decreased the performances of just 10 - 30 % despite the significant reduction in costs. Thirdly, platinum-based and platinum-free cathode SCMFC have been investigated in 20 weeks experiments and in long terms operation, the biofilm formation acted as biocatalyst enhancing the oxygen reduction at the cathode and similar performances with the Pt cathode were achieved.

40|$|The anodic {{behaviour}} of chalcopyrite at high potentials (transpassive region) in both sulfate and chloride solutions {{has been}} compared. It {{has been shown}} that the apparent plateau in the current/potential curve for the oxidation of chalcopyrite in dilute sulfuric solution at high potentials as observed in a recently published study has not been confirmed by several similar studies including the present one. Anodic oxidation at high potentials occurs at lower potentials in sulfate than in chloride <b>solutions.</b> <b>Anodic</b> oxidation in concentrated chloride solutions is more rapid at low potentials but severely inhibited relative to dilute chloride or sulfate solutions at high potentials. The behaviour in sulfate and chloride solutions has been confirmed by the results obtained from the oxidation of fine chalcopyrite particles that showed current peaks in the same potential regions as found using the bulk electrodes. The stoichiometry of anodic dissolution in both sulfate and chloride solutions at high potentials has confirmed published data of a consistent value of 6. 5 – 6. 7 F/mol copper dissolved that is independent of the source of the mineral, potential and solution composition. An alternative mechanism involving initial oxidation to H 2 S 2 O 2 and subsequent disproportionation to elemental sulfur and sulfate ions has been proposed that is consistent with the above stoichiometry and the yield of elemental sulfur. A possible explanation for slow oxidation in concentrated chloride solutions has been proposed that involves the formation of an inhibiting layer of S 2 Cl 2 on the surface...|$|R

Four elements constitute the integrated MECA payload: a microscopy station, patch plates, an electrometer, and the wet chemistry laboratory (WCL). The WCL consists of four identical cells, each of which will evaluate a sample of Martian soil in water to determine conductivity, pH, redox potential, dissolved C 02 and 02 levels, and concentrations of many soluble ions including sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and the halides.

40|$|International audienceIn current PEM fuel cells, high purity {{hydrogen}} {{is used as}} a fuel. This allows both to have good performances and to prevent the accumulation of inert gaz in the fuel cell when recirculation devices are used. This high purity gas involves considerable costs. It is possible to operate a PEMFC stack with non- pure anodic gases. This generates a loss of performances. The impure gases cannot be used in a fuel cell system using a hydrogen recirculation loop as impurities will tend to accumulate in the loop. Such gases must be used in configuration of continuous leakage to prevent any accumulation. We propose a solution to deal with non pure hydrogen. This solution uses an electrochemical hydrogen pump[1] that pumps solely pure hydrogen and thus removes a significant portion of impurities from the <b>anodic</b> gases. This <b>solution</b> is illustrated in the next figure. Polluted hydrogen enters the anodic compartment where it is consumed. The pump then separates the hydrogen from the pollutant. The pollutant is discharged through the leak and {{hydrogen is}} recirculated to the anodic compartment. A first experiment has shown the ability of such a device to pump hydrogen from mixtures (H 2 -N 2, H 2 -CH 4, CO 2 -H 2). A second experiment has shown that this pump can be used in place of a mechanical pump in a recirculation loop and that it permits to achieve the same performance of the stack. Finally, an experiment is underway to test the ability of the recirculation loop to deal with a polluted gaz. Reference : 1. F. Barbir et H.

40|$|The oxide {{formation}} by the <b>anodic</b> oxidation of <b>solutions</b> of the salts of metals {{is a group}} of reactions of considerable interest. Most of these oxides exist in two or more modifications. The anodic oxidation of plumbous salts can be considered as one of the examples of these reactions. Interest in the use of lead dioxide as anode for the preparation of inorganic and organic chemicals has been very much in evidence by number of publications. As an extension of the earlier work, where lead dioxide was deposited on graphite from nitrate bath using either rotation or to-and-fro motion, the electrode position of lead dioxide on a stationary graphite anode from a nitrate bath containing cationic surfactant, viz. cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was studied and it was found that smooth, adherent and pore-free deposit could be obtained from such a bath on a stationary anode employing even higher current densities. To obtain a similar pore-free and adherent deposit, the effect of ultrasonic during the deposition of lead dioxide on the graphite substrate was studied and the desired results were achieved. The X-ray analysis of the samples obtained at the above conditions showed that the lead dioxide was β-variety. The kinetic studies on electrode position of lead dioxide from nitrate solutions were carried out using galvanostatic pulse technique as well as potentiodynamic technique. Preliminary studies were carried out on the kinetics of electrode position of lead dioxide from a nitrate bath containing CTAB. The graphite substrate lead dioxide anode was used to get lead dioxide powder from nitrate bath by adjusting the operating conditions. It was further shown that the formation of lead dioxide onto lead and its alloys in sodium chloride solution was possible when lead dioxide microelectrode was embedded into the lead, similar to the use of platinum microelectrode reported by Shreir.

40|$|The {{management}} of dredged sediment is commonly {{recognized as a}} complex procedure in industrialized countries, where sediments are often contaminated by metals and organic contaminants due {{to the presence of}} a number of point and diffuse contamination sources (i. e., river and coastal discharges, shipping, yacht maintenance). Due to the huge amounts to be dredged every year due to harbor maintenance or environmental dredging activities, the identification of management options different from landfilling is claimed. The valorization of dredged sediments in application typical of the civil and environmental sector (i. e., road construction, embankments, structural materials formulation) usually needs a pretreatment stage aimed at improving the physical (water content, grain size distribution) and chemical properties (pollutants content, salt concentration) of the sediments. Among the available treatment options, Electrokinetic Remediation (EKR) seems to be particularly suitable due to a number of potential advantages, like the capability of treating fine graded and low-permeability matrices such as sediments, and the ability to remove organic and inorganic contaminants. EKR is based on the application of an electric field, originated from electrodes immersed in aqueous <b>solutions</b> (<b>anodic</b> and cathodic <b>solutions),</b> to a portion of the contaminated sediment so as to promote the mobilization of the contaminants. The application of EK to contaminated porous media induces the mobilization of ions towards the electrodes due to electromigration. electroosmosis, and electrophoresis. In order to improve the remediation process is possible to use enhancement agents like acids, chelating agents, surfactants added in electrode compartments. In particular, for the metals removal the use of the acids seems to be a promising strategy. However, due to the complexity of both the sediment matrix and the contaminants nature, despite the interest demonstrated by the scientific sector in EK, the uncertainties in process yields and control still hinder the full-scale application. The aim of this work consists in the study of lab-scale experiments of EKR carried out on metal contaminated sediment samples, collected in three Italian harbors. The EKR tests were performed using different types of agents, namely acetic, nitric and hydrochloric acid, EDTA and ascorbic acid. Each sample was characterized before the EKR test so as to determine: water content, grain size distribution, pH, Acid Neutralization Capacity (ANC), metal content, metal speciation and electrical resistivity. The results showed that the most critical elements were Cu, Cr, Ni, Cd, Pb and Zn, as they were present at concentrations above the limits defined by the Italian Ministry for the Environment. The EKR tests, performed in plexiglass cells, were conducted using the same conditions in terms of current density, while the duration of the tests and the dosages of the extracting agents were varied, {{in order to understand the}} best enhancement conditions on the basis of metals removal and metals mobilization results and to identify the parameters that can hinder the treatment. Furthermore during the treatment the electrical resistivity was monitored in order observe whether this physical parameter could provide information on the progress of decontamination. Main conclusions: The use of acids in order to neutralize the basic front produced at the cathode was found to be the best strategy in enhanced electrokinetics tests on dredging sediments. The tests also evidenced that the process was influenced by several factors: treatment time, properties of the matrix (buffering capacity) and of metals (metal fractionation). It was also observed the nonexistence of a condition of equilibrium between the process fluids and the matrix treated, hence it was not possible apply the prediction models generally used for the description of the chemical reactions. The monitoring of the electrical resistivity shown that through this parameter is not possible evaluate the migration of the metals during the treatment, likely due to the increase of the ionic content in the system caused by the addiction of the extracting agents. If this hypothesis is confirmed, the monitoring of the electrical resistivity could be used to evaluate the migration of the enhancing agents through the specimen and at this regard, further investigations are in progress...|$|R

The formation of oxide/hydroxide films was simulated by electrodeposition onto a graphite substrate from solutions of the appropriate metal salt. Synchrotron X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), supplemented by Laser Raman Spectroscopy (LRS), was used to determine the structure and composition of the host oxide film, as well as the impurity ion. Results have been obtained for the {{incorporation of}} Ce, Sr, Cr, Fe, and U into hydrous nickel oxide films. Ce and Sr oxides/hydroxides are co-precipitated with the nickel oxides in separate phase domains. Cr and Fe, on the other hand, are able to substitute into Ni lattice sites or intercalate in the interlamellar positions of the brucite structure of Ni(OH) {sub 2 }. U was found to co-deposit as a U(VI) hydroxide. The mode of incorporation of metal ions depends both on the size and charge of the metal ion. The structure of iron oxide (hydroxide) films prepared by both anodic and cathodic deposition has also been extensively studied. The structure of Fe(OH) {sub 2 } was determined to be similar to that of {alpha}-Ni(OH) {sub 2 }. <b>Anodic</b> deposition from <b>solutions</b> containing Fe{sup 2 +} results in a film with a structure similar to {gamma}-FeOOH. From the knowledge gained from the present studies, principles and methods for decontamination have become apparent. Contaminants sorbed on oxide surfaces or co-precipitated may be removed by acid wash and selective dissolution or complexation. Ions incorporated into lattice sites and interlamellar layers will require more drastic cleaning procedures. Electropolishing and the use of an electrochemical brush are among concepts that should be considered seriously for the latter cases. The incorporation of radionuclides into the structure of highly defective, insoluble oxides and clays should be considered for long-term storage and disposal. The establishment of a truly long-term (10 to 20 years) basic program on environmental science by DOE is strongly recommended. Avenues for future work are suggested...|$|R

Microorganisms contained in different natural environments such as marine sediments, waste water, and soils at the anode of a MFC, oxidize the dissolved organic matter contained in the environment, use the electron {{and give it to}} the electrode surface as the final electron acceptor. MFC present promising advantages with respect to the standard abiotic fuel cells. They offer the possibility of harvesting electricity from organic waste and renewable biomass because the as bacteria consortia can adapt to different organic matters contained in a large variety of ‘dirty' environments such as wastewaters or sediments. Therefore, the expensive catalyst such as Pt, which is required in abiotic fuel cells (PEM fuel cells for instance) is replaced by naturally growing microorganisms. Marine MFC have been investigated in the recent years with the end to operate low-power of requiring: marine instrumentations, such as oceanographic sensors, monitoring devices and telemetry systems. The purpose of this work was to check the effectiveness of electricity production by an MFC prototype where bacteria were growing in the anode of MFC cell, producing and releasing electrons to the electrode surface.

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates compositional variation of pentlandite [(Fe,Ni) 9 S 8] {{and the effect}} this variation may have on the electrochemical behaviour of pentlandite is poorly understood. Pentlandite is {{the primary source of}} nickel and an important base metal sulfide (BMS) in the platinum industry. It hosts significant amounts of PGEs especially palladium and rhodium when compared to chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite. The aim of the project was to investigate the possible compositional variations of natural pentlandite and the effect of these variations on the electrochemical behavior thereof. To study possible compositional variations, single pentlandite particles - in the order of 100 μm in size from flotation concentrates (PGM deposits) and massive samples (massive ore bodies) - from various sources were employed. Electron microprobe analysis indicated a compositional variation of the pentlandite particles hand-picked from the flotation concentrate samples. Variation was observed in the cobalt, iron and nickel content and this was independent of the deposit. A slight compositional variation was observed from the massive pentlandite samples. The effect the compositional variation may have on the electrochemical reactivity of pentlandite was investigated using electrochemical techniques, i. e. measurement of the polarisation resistance and mixed potential as well as performing linear anodic voltammetry, current density–transients and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (i. e. capacitance). Poor electrochemical response of the pentlandite microelectrodes was observed. Pre–existing pores, deep pores, cracks and the brittle nature of pentlandite microelectrodes {{may have contributed to the}} poor electrochemical response of natural pentlandite particles hand-picked from the flotation concentrate. Slight compositional variations of the massive pentlandite sample influenced the electrochemical behaviour. In aerated solutions, iron enriched pentlandites were less reactive after progressive oxidation. The lower reactivity of the electrodes was a result of thick oxide films formed. This was illustrated by polarisation resistance and capacitance measurements. The lower reactivity of the electrodes was also related to the mechanism of the reduction of oxygen at oxidised passive electrode surfaces. It is however difficult to distinguish if the differences in the reactivity was a result of the Fe/Ni ratio or the influence of cobalt. Current density transients confirmed that the reactivity of a pentlandite electrode to be time dependent. The reactivity of the electrode decreased during oxidation. A variation in the electronic properties of the formed oxide film was observed. Slight compositional variation of pentlandite did not have a significant effect on the rest potential values as do changes in the type of sulfides (e. g. pyrite vs. pentlandite). This was confirmed by similar rest potential values of various pentlandite electrodes. The oxidation of synthetic pentlandite may be influenced by the chemical composition.

40|$|Anodic {{activation}} {{of commercial and}} model aluminum alloys in chloride solution became of practical importance in connection with filiform corrosion of painted aluminum sheet in architectural application and aluminum components of brazed heat exchangers. Activation in chloride solution manifests itself {{in the form of}} a significant negative shift in the pitting potential relative to pure aluminum and a significant increase in the anodic current output at potentials where aluminum is normally expected to be passive. This activation is caused by trace elements in Group IIIA-VA in aluminum alloy, mainly Pb, Bi, Ga, In, and Sn, with low melting points. For alloys heat treated at 600 °C, which is a relevant temperature, e. g., for brazing, segregation of Pb, a common trace element in most commercial alloys, as a nanofilm between the thermal oxide and the metal substrate was identified as the main cause of anodic activation. This nanofilm was independent of Pb concentration in the alloy and could only form by heat treatment at 600 °C. However, certain recycled commercial alloys were activated by annealing at temperatures significantly lower than 600 °C, e. g., 300 °C, at which Pb did not segregate to the surface because of higher melting point and lower mobility. The effect of other trace elements with lower melting points than Pb, such as Sn, was suggested to be taken into consideration. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate surface segregation of tin, present at small concentrations in pure aluminum, by heat treatment and chemical etching and resulting {{activation of}} the alloy surface. The study focuses on the effect of Sn concentration in the alloy, heat treatment temperature and time, the method of cooling after heat treatment, oxidation during heat treatment and cooling, the nature of segregation and/or enrichment at the surface as a result of heat treatment (thermal segregation) and by dealloying during subsequent anodic polarization in chloride <b>solution</b> (<b>anodic</b> segregation), the role of chloride ions in the solution, and the electrochemical mechanism of activation. Model binary alloys, containing 30, 100, 500, and 1000 ppm Sn, denoted as AlSn 30, AlSn 100, AlSn 500, and AlSn 1000, respectively, were prepared by casting from pure components. The samples were prepared by scalping, homogenization, cold rolling and metallographic polishing of the cast alloys. The specimens were then heat treated in an air circulating furnace at various temperatures between 100 and 600 °C for 1 h. After annealing, the samples were quenched in water or in 96 % ethanol solution, or they were cooled in air for comparison. Most samples were characterized electrochemically in this condition. The AlSn 1000 specimens, which formed a thick oxide layer on the surface as a result of this treatment, were immersed in a standardized hot chromic-phosphoric acid stripping bath (ASTM G 1 - 90) to dissolve the oxide without damaging the underlying metallic surface and to obtain information about the properties of the substrate underneath the oxide. Some AlSn 30 samples were mechanically polished after heat treatment and re-annealed at selected temperatures. Selected AlSn 30 samples were also etched in 10 wt% NaOH for 10 s at 60 °C and then de-smutted for 1 min in concentrated nitric acid at 25 °C before electrochemical characterization. The highest degree of thermal segregation of Sn to the metal-oxide interface occurred by annealing of the model binary AlSn alloys at 300 °C. Optimal segregation of Sn at this temperature resulted from a balance between high mobility of Sn in the liquid state and low solubility of Sn in aluminum. Segregation of Sn was reduced at lower and higher temperatures as a result of decreased mobility of Sn and increased solubility of Sn in Al, respectively. Thermal segregation of Sn at 300 °C occurred in the form of nanoparticles and enrichment along certain crystallographic planes at the metal-oxide interface. The latter form was responsible for activation of aluminum alloy in chloride solution and independent of the bulk Sn concentration. Anodic segregation of Sn also occurred in chloride solution with increasing Sn concentration in the bulk, and these segregations also contributed to the activation of the AlSn alloy surface. Without heat treatment, tin concentration had an insignificant effect on the electrochemical behavior up to 500 ppm. However, alloy containing 1000 ppm Sn was significantly activated by lowering the pitting potential to - 1. 38 VSCE in chloride <b>solution.</b> <b>Anodic</b> activation of AlSn alloys in chloride solution, obtained by annealing at 300 °C, was however temporary. Corrosion was significantly reduced to near passivity as the segregated Sn was etched away from the surface, to a level that was independent of Sn concentration. This was caused by segregation of most bulk Sn to the surface during heat treatment, reducing the bulk Sn concentration to the solid solubility level of Sn with aluminum at 300 °C. Corrosion of samples annealed at 300 °C occurred in the form of uniform etching from a macroscopic viewpoint, in the active potential region. Microscopically, corrosion was in the form of needle-shaped attack, undermining the oxide and following certain crystallographic planes by a mechanism similar to filiform corrosion. This directional activation of the surface was attributed to enrichment of Sn along preferred crystallographic planes near the surface. Annealing at 600 °C caused increasing activation with increasing Sn concentration. Activation occurred as a result of Sn enrichment at the metal surface by dealloying of aluminum during corrosion (anodic segregation). Corrosion was localized in the form of grain boundary corrosion for Sn concentration less than and equal to 500 ppm and pitting following the triple grain boundaries for 1000 ppm. Both annealing time and cooling rate had insignificant effect on the polarization behavior of AlSn 30 alloys in chloride solution, because the amount and state of tin segregation at the metal-oxide interface was not affected. In contrast, mechanical polishing removed any segregated tin layer and nearly eliminated activation of aluminum. Alkaline etching increased activation of AlSn 30 alloys by causing anodic segregation of Sn. A thick oxide layer was formed on 300 °C-annealed AlSn 500 and AlSn 1000, as well as 600 °C-annealed AlSn 1000 samples during water quenching, demonstrating that Sn at these levels activated Al in chloride-free water/steam at a high temperature. For samples treated at 300 °C, activation of alloys AlSn 500 and AlSn 1000 was caused mainly by Sn that was segregated during heat treatment. For AlSn 1000 samples annealed at 600 °C, activation was caused by Sn segregating in situ by dealloying during water quenching. Activation during water quenching was related to the combined presence of segregated liquid Sn and super-heated steam at the surface. This thick oxide layer could act as a barrier layer and introduce partial passivation during polarization in chloride solution. The activation mechanism of Al by Sn in chloride solution and during water quenching was attributed to the amalgamation theory, which is originally based on the activation of aluminum by Hg at room temperature and also attributed to the activation of aluminum by low melting point elements Ga and In in the literature. The present work showed that Sn is a more effective activator than indium under identical conditions, although Sn has a higher melting point. The observed difference between Sn and In is difficult to explain in view of the close proximity of the two elements in the periodic table, especially the fact that the presence of In does not give rise to voluminous oxidation of Al during quenching. Solubility of aluminum in the liquid film forming at the metal-oxide interface is suggested as an important factor determining the rate of aluminum oxidation according to the amalgamation theory. The fact that the solubility of Al in liquid Sn is significantly higher than that in liquid In may explain the activating capability of Sn. Another possible factor is the melting point depression caused by the size of segregated film and particles of these elements activating aluminum, which is envisaged as an important factor for maintaining the fluidized state of the film down to room temperature. It is argued that Sn can undergo a more significant depression of its melting (or solidification) point with reduction in size compared to In.
