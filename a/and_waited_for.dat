5|$|When Antigonus reached Sellasia {{with his}} army, {{he found it}} well guarded and decided against {{storming}} the strong position. Instead he pitched camp near Sellasia <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> several days. During this time, he sent scouts to reconnoiter the areas and feign attacks on Cleomenes' position.|$|E
5|$|At 03:00, the 8th Heavy Company, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment with 75mm SP guns, 20mm AA guns, and mortars {{attacked}} 'A' and 'C' Companies, 7th Parachute Battalion, {{from the}} south. The paratroops were forced {{back and the}} Germans established their own positions in Bénouville, but were unable to break the British line. They dug in <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> tank support before moving forward again. The Germans fired mortar bombs and machine guns at the paratroopers and attempted small assaults on their positions throughout the night.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the capture}} of Belgrade on 11 October and the initial {{clearance}} of mines and other obstacles, the flotilla sailed downstream to Orșova near the Hungarian–Romanian border <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> the lower Danube to be swept for mines. Commencing on 30 October 1915, they escorted a series of munitions convoys down the Danube to Lom where the munitions were transferred to the Bulgarian railway system for shipment to the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann patiently {{waited for}} the right moment to escape, then, using the {{distraction}} of the Stukas attack, he attacked the single guard. Hartmann jumped {{out of the back of}} the truck and ran into a large field of giant sunflowers. Evading the pursuing soldiers, Hartmann hid <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> nightfall. In the dark, Hartmann followed a Soviet patrol heading west to the front. As he approached the German position, he was challenged by a sentry who fired a shot which passed through his trousers.|$|E

According to the plan, Khiêm's forces in Saigon would surround the homes of the sleeping junta members while Khánh and a paratrooper unit would occupy the Joint General Staff headquarters near Tan Son Nhut Air Base. Thi followed Khánh to the capital on the same day, and the plotters met in obscure places around town.|$|E

5|$|The British {{had been}} alerted to Arnold's {{approach}} and had destroyed {{all of the}} boats on the river's southern banks. Although two warships, the frigate Lizard (26 guns) and the sloop-of-war Hunter (16 guns), kept up a constant patrol to prevent a river crossing, Arnold was able to procure sufficient watercraft for his men, and crossed to the Quebec City side on November 11. He then realized his force was {{not strong enough to}} capture the city, so he retreated several miles <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|A {{committee}} {{was set up}} in October 1838 to investigate the viability of a causeway at the site. On 16 February 1839 plans which had been prepared by Roe were submitted by the committee's chairman to Henry Trigg, the Superintendent of Public Works. Trigg called for other plans and prepared estimates. At a meeting of the committee on 27 February 1839, Trigg submitted a plan designed by Major Frederick Irwin, which was estimated to cost £2,300. The committee cut the estimated figure to £1,800, <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> Governor Hutt to specify how much could be funded by the government.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of Russian retreats at the {{beginning}} of the campaign, the nobility grew alarmed about the advancing French troops and forced the Czar to dismiss the army's commander, Barclay de Tolly. Mikhail Kutuzov was appointed as his replacement. In a final attempt to save Moscow, the Russians made a stand near the village of Borodino, west of the town of Mozhaysk. They fortified their positions <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> the French to attack. The Russian right wing occupied ideal defensive terrain, so the French tried to press the Russian left for much of the battle.|$|E

5|$|Beauchamp rode to Frankfort on business, {{reaching}} it on November 6. Unable to find lodging at {{the local}} inns, he rented {{a room in the}} private residence of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Sometime after midnight, Scott heard a commotion from Beauchamp's room. When he investigated, he found the door latch open and the room unoccupied. Beauchamp, clad in a disguise, buried a set of his clothes near the Kentucky River, then proceeded to Sharp's house. Sharp was not at home, but Beauchamp soon found him at a local hotel. He returned to Sharp's house, concealed himself nearby, <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> Sharp's return. He observed Sharp re-enter the house about midnight.|$|E
5|$|General Robert E. Lee {{commanded}} the Army of Northern Virginia, while Major General John Brown Gordon commanded its Second Corps. Early {{in the morning}} of April 9, Gordon attacked, aiming to break through Federal lines at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, but failed, and the Confederate Army was then surrounded. At 8:30 A.M. that morning, Lee requested a meeting with Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant to discuss surrendering the Army of Northern Virginia. Shortly after twelve o'clock, Grant's reply reached Lee, and in it Grant said he would accept the surrender of the Confederate Army under certain conditions. Lee then rode into the little hamlet of Appomattox Court House, where the Appomattox county court house stood, <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> Grant's arrival to surrender his army.|$|E
5|$|Harold's brother Tostig and Harald Hardrada invaded Northumbria in September 1066 and {{defeated}} the local forces under Morcar and Edwin at the Battle of Fulford near York. King Harold received word of their invasion and marched north, defeating the invaders and killing Tostig and Hardrada on 25 September at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. The Norman fleet finally set sail two days later, landing in England at Pevensey Bay on 28 September. William {{then moved to}} Hastings, a few miles to the east, where he built a castle as a base of operations. From there, he ravaged the interior <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> Harold's return from the north, refusing to venture far from the sea, his line of communication with Normandy.|$|E

5|$|Jones {{decided to}} bring back his other two squads to form a solid line and, expecting to be gone only a few minutes, he left his SCR-300 radio behind. Jones found one squad but the other had gone on farther and was not visible. While he studied the terrain <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> a {{messenger}} he had sent to bring back that last squad, North Koreans attacked the main company position behind him. Judging by the noise he heard, Jones thought North Koreans had moved in force to the wooded bowl {{between him and the}} rest of the company. Jones never got back to his 3rd Squad. He {{and the rest of the}} platoon dropped down off the ridge into a gully on the left.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} day of the battle the Persian fleet was ready to attack the Allied lines in full force. Seeing the Persian fleet assemble, the Allies {{attempted}} to block the Straits of Artemisium as best they could, <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> the Persians to attack. The Persians formed their ships into a semicircle and tried to enclose the Allied fleet, upon which the Allies rowed forward and joined battle. The battle raged all day long, with the Allies hard put to defend their line. When the fleets finally disengaged at nightfall, both sides had suffered roughly equal losses. However, the smaller Allied fleet could scarcely afford such losses; half the Athenian ships (the largest contingent in the fleet) were damaged or lost.|$|E
5|$|The Octopus {{system was}} {{launched}} {{after three years}} of trials on 1 September 1997. Three million cards were issued within {{the first three months of}} the system's launch. The quick success of the system was compelled by the fact that MTR and KCR required all holders of Common Stored Value Tickets to replace their tickets with Octopus cards in three months or have their tickets made obsolete, which drove commuters to switch quickly. Another reason was the coin shortage in Hong Kong in 1997. With the transfer of Hong Kong away from British rule, there was a belief that the older Queen's Head coins in Hong Kong would rise in value, so many people hoarded these older coins <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> their value to increase.|$|E

5|$|Their {{relationship}} was further strained in 1946 when Fontaine made negative comments to an interviewer about deHavilland's new husband, Marcus Goodrich. When she read her sister's remarks, deHavilland was deeply hurt <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> an apology {{that was never}} offered. The following year after accepting her first Academy Award for To Each His Own, deHavilland was approached backstage by Fontaine, who extended her hand to congratulate her; deHavilland {{turned away from her}} sister. The two did not speak {{for the next five years}} after the incident. This may have caused an estrangement between Fontaine and her own daughters, who maintained a covert relationship with their aunt, deHavilland.|$|E
5|$|Xerxes's {{estimated}} time {{of arrival}} at Thermopylae coincided with both the Olympic Games and the festival of Carneia. For the Spartans, warfare during these periods was considered sacrilegious. Despite the uncomfortable timing, the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they dispatched their king Leonidas I with his personal bodyguard (the Hippeis) of 300 men. The customary elite young men in the Hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had children. Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Allied Peloponnesian cities, and other forces that the Allies picked up on the way to Thermopylae. The Allies proceeded to occupy the pass, rebuilt the wall the Phocians had built at the narrowest point of the pass, <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> Xerxes's arrival.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17, 1776, commander-in-chief General George Washington brought the Continental Army {{to defend the}} port city of New York, then limited to the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the city's harbor would provide an excellent base for the British Navy during the campaign, so he established defenses there <b>and</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> the British to attack. In July, the British under the command of General William Howe landed a few miles across the harbor from Manhattan on the sparsely-populated Staten Island, where they were slowly reinforced by ships in Lower New York Bay during the next month and a half, bringing their total force to 32,000 troops. Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city with the British fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at the Narrows, and he moved the bulk of his forces to Manhattan, believing that {{it would be the first}} target.|$|E
