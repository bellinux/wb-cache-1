40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the short- and long-run {{relationship between}} inbound tourism <b>and</b> total <b>exports</b> of goods in general, <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> of agro-food products in particular. An empirical {{study was conducted}} using monthly data on inbound tourism, total <b>exports</b> of goods, <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> of agro-food products for the period between 2000 and 2012, in Portugal. The results reveal that inbound tourism <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> of agro-food products are cointegrated. Therefore a long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables can be inferred. The Granger causality test results suggest that inbound tourism in Portugal stimulates growth of exports in general. Furthermore, <b>exports</b> of goods <b>and</b> <b>exports</b> of agro-food products also stimulate inbound tourism. Our empirical findings provide important policy implications concerning international tourism and trade. inbound tourism; exports; agro-food products; cointegration; Granger causality; Portugal; international tourism; trade...|$|R

In Navajo weaving, the slit weave technique common in kilims is not used, and the warp is one continuous length of yarn, not extending beyond the weaving as fringe. Traders from the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged adoption of some kilim motifs into Navajo designs.|$|E
