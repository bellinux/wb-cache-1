5|$|As {{with the}} 1963 {{assassination}} of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's death {{has been the}} subject of widespread analysis. Some individuals involved in the original investigation and some researchers have suggested <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> for the crime, or have argued that there are serious problems with the official case.|$|E
5|$|A {{challenge}} {{to all of}} these <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios</b> came when Turner and colleagues in 2007 described a new dromaeosaurid, Mahakala, which they found to be the most basal and most primitive member of the Dromaeosauridae, more primitive than Microraptor. Mahakala had short arms and no ability to glide. Turner et al. also inferred that flight evolved only in the Avialae, and these two points suggested that the ancestral dromaeosaurid could not glide or fly. Based on this cladistic analysis, Mahakala suggests that the ancestral condition for dromaeosaurids is non-volant. However, in 2012, an expanded and revised study incorporating the most recent Dromaeosaurid finds recovered the Archaeopteryx-like Xiaotingia as the most primitive member of the clade Dromaeosauridae, which appears to suggest the earliest members of the clade may have been capable of flight.|$|E

The allocation program that had {{been put in place}} in March 2008 was lifted on June 15, 2009, leading to speculation that proof and uncirculated versions might be produced {{before the end of the}} year. However, on October 6, 2009, the Mint {{announced that}} the collectible versions of the Silver Eagle coin would not be produced for 2009. The disappointment of collectors was expressed in a December 1 article by Representative Gary C. Peters (D-Michigan).

Moy urging him to begin minting these products as soon as possible and continuing to do so until the end of the year. This effort was not successful and the collectible versions were not produced. The sale of 2009 Silver Eagle bullion coins was suspended from November 24 to December 6 and the allocation program was re-instituted on December 7; the product sold out on January 12, 2010.|$|E

40|$|The benefit (or additionality) {{attributable}} to a conservation action {{is the difference}} between the outcomes of two scenarios: (1) the scenario with the conservation action, and (2) the <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario,</b> in which action did not occur. However, many conservation decisions are made using approaches that do not appropriately calculate this benefit. We review recent scientific literature and conservation policies to examine how conservation benefit is calculated in three situations: systematic reserve selection, investment in agri-environment schemes, and biodiversity offset trades. In the examples we considered, the approaches used to calculate conservation benefit often involved assumptions about the <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> that were not explicit, demonstrably wrong or both. We suggest that assumptions about how conservation value changes over time in the <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> can often be substantially refined, and that making these assumptions explicit by calculating directly the expected difference between the two scenarios is likely {{to improve the quality of}} conservation decision-making...|$|R

25|$|Less than a {{week after}} the assassination, President Johnson demanded in the name of {{patriotic}} duty that Warren head the governmental commission to investigate the death of John F. Kennedy. It was an unhappy experience for Warren, who did not want the assignment. As a judge, he valued candor and justice, but as a politician he recognized the need for secrecy in some matters. He insisted that the commission report should be unanimous, and so he compromised {{on a number of issues}} in order to get all the members to sign the final version. Many conspiracy theorists have attacked the commission's findings ever since, claiming that key evidence is missing or distorted and that there are many inconsistencies in the report. The Commission concluded that the assassination was the result of a single individual, Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone. Fears of possible Soviet or Cuban foreign involvement in the assassination necessitated the establishment of a bipartisan commission that, in turn, sought to depoliticize Oswald's role by downplaying his Communist affiliations. The commission weakened its findings by not sharing the government's deepest secrets. The report's lack of candor furthered antigovernment cynicism, which in turn stimulated conspiracy theorists who propounded any number of <b>alternative</b> <b>scenarios,</b> many of which appear mutually contradictory.|$|E

In general, due to the obscure archaeological picture in 12th-11th century BC Greece, there is a continuing controversy among scholars over whether the impoverished societies that succeeded the Mycenaean palatial states were newcomers or populations that already resided in Mycenaean Greece. Recent archaeological findings tend to favor the latter scenario. Additional theories, concerning natural factors, such as climate change, droughts or earthquakes have also been proposed. The period following the end of Mycenaean Greece, c. 1100-800 BC, is generally termed the [...] "Greek Dark Ages".|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{extend our}} earlier work to provide {{additional}} evidence for an <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> to explain the nature of so-called `explosive events'. The bi-directed, fast Doppler motion of explosive events observed spectroscopically in the transition region emission is classically interpreted {{as a pair of}} bidirectional jets moving upward and downward from a reconnection site. We discuss the problems of such a model. In our previous work, we focused basically on the discrepancy of fast Doppler motion without detectable motion in the image plane. We now suggest an <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> for the explosive events, based on our observations of spectral line tilts and bifurcated structure in some events. Both features are indicative of rotational motion in narrow structures. We explain the bifurcation as the result of rotation of hollow cylindrical structures and demonstrate that such a sheath model can also be applied to explain the nature of the puzzling `explosive events'. We find that the spectral tilt, the lack of apparent motion, the bifurcation, and a rapidly growing number of direct observations support an <b>alternative</b> <b>scenario</b> of linear, spicular-sized jets with a strong spinning motion.

While developed countries could use less energy, a large increase is needed to lift billions out of poverty, including over 25 % of the world’s population who still lack electricity. Meeting demand in an environmentally responsible manner will be a huge challenge.
