5|$|Dr. Génessier {{performs}} heterograft surgery, removing Edna's face. The doctor successfully grafts {{the skin}} onto his daughter's face {{and holds the}} heavily bandaged and faceless Edna against her will. Edna escapes, but falls to her death from an upstairs window. After disposing of Edna's corpse, Génessier notices flaws on Christiane's face. Her face grows worse within days; the new tissue is being rejected <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> resort to wearing her mask again. Christiane again phones Jacques and this time says his name, but the phone call is interrupted by Louise.|$|E
5|$|The film stars Mamatha Bhukya as {{the title}} character: a 15-year-old {{daughter}} of a poor fisherman set in the backdrop of a rustic state of Andhra Pradesh in Southern India. She learns Kuchipudi, a classical Indian dance form, while being employed at a local landlady's house. All {{seems to be going}} well for her until sexual chemistry evolves between her and the landlady's son, and this eventually leads her being raped by him. The ensuing pregnancy disrupts her simple life, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> choose {{how to deal with the}} child.|$|E
5|$|A sexual {{harassment}} lawsuit was filed against Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{in the previous}} episode, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> take a {{sexual harassment}} training as a result. In addition, she cannot return to work until she is done with her training. Liz, however, cannot handle life without work, as she needs the stress. Her attitude changes when she meets one of her neighbors, Emily (Elizabeth Marvel). She understands how Liz feels because she was just like Liz and tells her there are better ways to live. Liz hangs out with Emily and her friends (Mary Catherine Garrison, Kerry Butler, and Christina Gausas), who spend majority of their time getting spa treatments and going shopping. Liz gets {{so caught up in}} their lifestyle that she forgets to watch her show, The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). Not wanting to come back to work—as she is intrigued by her new friends' lifestyle—Liz sexually harasses her counselor, Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane). She goes back to hanging out with Emily and her friends, but soon discovers that they are a Girl Fight Club, which disappoints Liz. In order for her to get out, Liz needs to fight them.|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> now <b>she</b> <b>must</b> leave it. <b>She</b> knew that, {{even while}} she had contended against the idea to Gilbert. The little house was outgrown. Gilbert's {{interests}} made the change necessary; his work, successful though it had been, was hampered by his location. Anne realised {{that the end of}} their life in this dear place drew nigh, <b>and</b> that <b>she</b> <b>must</b> face the fact bravely. But how her heart ached! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, it's infamous!' {{she cried}} suddenly. 'She's lied to you, she's been odiously deceitful. <b>She</b> <b>must</b> be vile <b>and</b> heartless. <b>She</b> <b>must</b> be rotten {{to the very}} soul.' ...|$|R
60|$|She laughed again. I {{wanted her}} to go on talking, because her laugh was so delightful. But we had reached the road, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> said <b>she</b> <b>must</b> go back: {{there were so many}} things she had to do.|$|R
5|$|Six {{months later}} in Tokyo, Saya saves {{a girl named}} Mana Hiiragi from a berserk {{humanoid}} Elder Bairn. Mana and Saya are rescued by Mana's comrades in SIRRUT, a covert group resisting Fumito's group who heard about Saya's past through Itsuki Tomofusa, a spy who died following the experiment. The group is led by Fumito's relative Kuroto Mogari, whose family was killed so Fumito could have control over the Shrovetide. Kuroto offers Saya SIRRUT's aid finding Fumito in exchange for her help. Hunted by Tower, and after saving Mana from Youth Ordinance Bill enforcers, Saya agrees to help. Saya and Mana infiltrate a private academy funded by Fumito when {{he is scheduled to}} give a lecture. When Saya attacks, it is revealed to be a trap baited with a false version of Fumito, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> fight off an Elder Bairn before they can escape. In the aftermath, Mana reveals that her father disappeared after she helped him with his research into Tower. Regaining her confidence as a hacker, Mana locates Tower's main base, allowing Saya to infiltrate the base.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, enemies appear in the open field and can be avoided or engaged. The number of enemies increases during night-time, and their strength and ability to deal damage increases the more days pass in-game. By killing all the standard versions of an enemy, a final version appears as a boss. Defeating it will yield a high reward and make the enemy type extinct {{in an area of}} the game. When Lightning attacks an enemy, or they attack her, the battle starts. If Lightning strikes a monster, they lose a small portion of health, while if the enemy strikes Lightning first, she will lose health. As Lightning performs attacks, her ATB meter is drained <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> switch to another assigned garb: the depleted garb's meter recharges while not being used. Lightning utilizes her many swords for short-range melee attacks and magic for long-range attacks. She can block enemy attacks using her shield and has the option to evade an attack, which can be assigned to any garb. Each enemy has a stagger meter, represented by a line behind their health bar. As Lightning lands certain kinds of magical or physical blows on the enemy, their meter oscillates more. Eventually, the enemy is staggered, rendering them vulnerable to damaging attacks. Lightning can also spend Energy Points to perform special moves or activate abilities, such as Overclock (which slows time for Lightning's opponents and enables her to land more hits); and Army of One, Lightning's signature move. By winning battles, Lightning earns gil, the in-game currency, and replenishes a portion of her Energy Point gauge. In Normal and Hard modes, if Lightning flees from or dies in battle, one in-game hour is lost. Unlike the last two games, the player character does not automatically recover HP after battles, instead needing to use remedies bought from merchants and shops, and there is no auto-battle mode, with Lightning needing to be controlled manually at all times. In Easy Mode, Lightning regenerates health if she stands idle.|$|E
25|$|In Roberta Gellis's 2003 novel Lucrezia Borgia and the Mother of Poisons, Alfonso d'Este of Ferrara accuses Lucrezia of murder, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> {{solve the}} crime and expose the true murderer.|$|E

25|$|The woman must be psychologically {{motivated}} to undergo such great surgical interventions (reconstruction and harvesting), <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> physically possess sufficient abdominal tissues (skin, muscle, and fat) {{with which to}} construct the replacement breast. The division of the superior epigastric blood supply, by a previous surgery, precludes a pedicled TRAM flap as the feasible method for breast reconstruction. A radical mastectomy defect (hole) requiring a great volume of replacement tissue. A medical history of radiation to the chest wall. A large opposite breast, which is difficult to match with a pectoral implant; and a previous, failed reconstruction with a breast implant.|$|E
25|$|Phyllis Lindstrom (Cloris Leachman) (1970–75) is Mary's snobbish {{friend and}} neighbor. She {{is married to}} an unseen character, Lars, a dermatologist, and has a {{precocious}} daughter, Bess (Lisa Gerritsen). Phyllis is controlling and often arrogant. She is actively involved in groups and clubs and is a political activist and a supporter of Women's Liberation. Rhoda and Phyllis are usually at odds {{with each other and}} often trade insults. After five seasons, Phyllis is widowed, learns her husband had virtually no assets <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> support herself; she moves to San Francisco in the spinoff series Phyllis.|$|E
25|$|She {{was very}} {{beautiful}} girl, all my girls are beautiful. I went to London {{with her in}} 1933. Bucky (Buckminster Fuller) and I were there the night before she did it. I remember very well she said, 'Well that's {{the end of the}} vodka. There isn't any more.' Just like that you know. I wouldn't have thought of it much, except afterward I realized that that's what she was talking about. Dorothy was very pretty, and she traveled in this false world. She didn't want to be second to anybody, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> have thought she was slipping.|$|E

25|$|The game {{begins with}} the Romans under attack by the Amazons, and {{on the brink of}} defeat. They barely survive, and the Amazons next attack the Asians and Egyptians in turn, {{prompting}} Jupiter, Horus and Ch'ih-yu to ally. In the newly renamed 2 Gorgons, they meet to discuss strategy, fully aware that the Gorgons, Q'nqüra's aunts, are spying on them, and feeding details of their plan to Q'nqüra. Meanwhile, the men launch an all-out offensive, although Helios is worried that Q'nqüra's response is too subdued, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> have a plan. His concerns are ignored, however, as the others assure him that because their enemy is a woman, there is nothing to worry about. Confidant that the Amazons are nearly defeated, Jupiter leaves Horus to fight on, whilst he pillages both Egyptian and Amazonian lands. Disgusted, Horus withdraws from the fight, and Jupiter, in a temper, cuts off his own troops, leaving Ch'ih-yu to see out the conflict alone.|$|E
500|$|The {{aircraft}} crashed at 11:00am, 18minutes after take-off, near Sutton Wick, [...] {{south of}} Abingdon. 50-year-old Muriel Binnington {{lived in the}} prefabricated house. Eyewitness Eric Webb said it was [...] "swept away", <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> have been killed instantly. A 19-year-old called J Maltravers from the Southern Electricity Board {{was in one of}} the houses to read the electricity meter and was also killed. The tail section of the aircraft crashed on a farmhouse near the main wreckage, trapping and seriously injuring Margaret Stanton in the kitchen of the house. She was later freed by emergency workers.|$|E
500|$|In {{her third}} autobiography, Angelou {{is placed in}} {{circumstances}} that force her to change her opinions about whites, not an easy change for her. Louise Cox, the co-owner of the record store she frequents on Fillmore Street, generously offers Angelou employment and friendship. Angelou marries a white man, whose appreciation of Black music breaks her stereotype of whites. This is a difficult decision for Angelou, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> justify it by rationalizing that Tosh is Greek, and not an American white. She was not marrying [...] "one of the enemy", {{but she could not}} escape the embarrassment and shame when they encountered other Blacks. Later, she has a friendship among equals with her white co-workers, Jorie, Don, and Barrie, who assist her job quest at The Purple Onion. Cudjoe insists, [...] "This free and equal relationship is significant to her in that it represents an important stage of her evolution toward adulthood".|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>must</b> <b>she</b> {{speak at}} last, rather than die? [...] <b>And</b> <b>must</b> <b>she</b> plead, without another's aid? [...] <b>She</b> <b>must,</b> <b>she</b> must: the vital moments fly [...] She lives--she dies, a passion-wasted maid. [...] At length she bursts all ties of modesty: [...] Her tongue {{explains}} her eyes; {{the words are}} said [...] <b>And</b> <b>she</b> asks pity, underneath that blow [...] Which he, perhaps, that gave it did not know.|$|R

500|$|Prior to the American {{entry into}} the war, Woodrow Wilson called for a [...] "peace of {{reconciliation}} with Germany", what he dubbed a [...] "peace without victory". His wartime speeches, however, rejected these earlier notions and he took an increasingly belligerent stance towards Germany. Following the war, on 4 September 1919, during his public campaign to rally American support for the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson commented that the treaty [...] "seeks to punish {{one of the greatest}} wrongs ever done in history, the wrong which Germany sought to do to the world and to civilization, and there ought to be no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment. She attempted an intolerable thing, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> be made to pay for the attempt." [...] Regardless of the rhetoric, the American position was to create a balanced treaty that would appease everyone. Gordon Auchincloss, secretary to Edward M. House (one of Wilson's advisers), sent a copy of the clause to the State Department and stated [...] "you will note that the President's principles have been protected in this clause".|$|E

[...] O'Hara tells Sadie that he has a fishing boat waiting to take her and her things to a ship that will then take her to Australia, where they can marry and be free. [...] Sadie is extremely afraid and refuses to go, saying that the [...] "old Sadie is dead" [...] <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> go to San Francisco and prison, to repent.|$|E
60|$|Sadie waited calmly. <b>She</b> had courage <b>and</b> knew <b>she</b> <b>must</b> {{be frank}} with her father. He did not, as a rule, say much, but he noted things and understood.|$|R

2500|$|Wilson {{had earlier}} downplayed Germany's guilt in {{starting}} {{the war by}} calling for [...] "peace without victory", but he had taken an increasingly hard stand at Paris and rejected advice to soften the treaty's treatment of Germany. In a reversal of his earlier position, in summer 1919 Wilson repeatedly stressed Germany's guilt, saying the treaty, [...] "seeks to punish {{one of the greatest}} wrongs ever done in history, the wrong which Germany sought to do to the world and to civilization; and there ought to be no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment. She attempted an intolerable thing, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> be made to pay for the attempt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Battle {{was born}} in Portsmouth, Ohio, USA, the {{youngest}} of seven children. Her father was a steelworker, and her mother was {{an active participant in}} the gospel music of the family's African Methodist Episcopal church. Battle attended Portsmouth High School where her music teacher and mentor was Charles P. (Phil) Varney. In a 1985 Time Magazine interview, Varney recalled the first time he heard [...] the eight-year-old Battle sing, describing her as [...] "this tiny little thing singing so beautifully." [...] "I went to her later", Varney recalled, [...] "and told her God had blessed her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> always sing." [...] In that same interview, music critic Michael Walsh described Battle as [...] "the best lyric coloratura in the world".|$|E
2500|$|When Charles Pratt, Jr. {{took over}} as head writer of All My Children in 2008, one of his goals for {{improving}} the series involved making Erica {{the focus of the}} show again.

[...] "I can see the temptation to split her off and put her in jail and put her on the run. We did it on Ugly Betty! But to me, she is the Scarlett O'Hara of this show <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> always be that, be the center and the heart of the show.
