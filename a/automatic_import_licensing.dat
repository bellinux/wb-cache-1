40|$|Recent {{discussions on}} U. S. trade {{policies}} suggest that import quotas should be auctioned {{to ensure the}} U. S. Treasury acquires the quota rent. However, studies estimating the potential benefits have ignored important details of import quota regimes and have assumed perfect competition and no exporter retaliation. We explore these three issues with an application to the U. S. cheese import quota regime. We show that when features of the U. S. dairy quota regime {{and structure of the}} cheese processing sector are accounted for, likely quota rents and potential welfare consequences of selling <b>import</b> <b>licenses</b> change significantly. While quota license sales may raise Treasury receipts, they may also cause a net welfare loss. Key words: imperfect competition, <b>import</b> quotas, <b>licenses,</b> quota rents, U.

The four challengers assert the same basic allegation: That Argentina has used <b>import</b> <b>licensing</b> and registration requirements as an informal trade balancing program to favor domestic producers, withholding the licenses from importers unless they agree to certain export quotas. In March, 2012, 14 members of the WTO Council for Trade in Goods, including the U.S., EU and Mexico, said the regulations were creating long delays and resulting in huge costs {{for many of the}} companies doing business with Argentina.

This paper demonstrates that for a given <b>import</b> quota, such <b>licensing</b> restrictions can actually increase domestic production of both the input and the final product, but at the cost of reduced quota rents. Under pure competition, domestic welfare falls relative to the use of marketable quota licenses, but if foreigners would get the quota rents, or if external economies cause decreasing costs, then bureaucratic allocation can dominate. ...|$|R
