5|$|The final {{song of the}} Bat trilogy is a {{short one}} written by Steinman. A few lyrics of Cry to Heaven begin rather sweet, but turning rather bitter: (Cry baby cry/Cry, cry to heaven/If that doesn't do it for you/Go ahead <b>and</b> <b>cry</b> like hell.) The two parts are bridged by an {{instrumental}} dominated by an Irish flute.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Smith's death, the fourteen-year-old Lennon was visiting members of the Stanley family in Sango Bay, Durness, Scotland, and was not {{informed}} until he returned home. Lennon's first reaction was to laugh hysterically, but then to privately grieve <b>and</b> <b>cry,</b> as he later did after hearing {{about the death of}} his mother three years later, and the death of Stuart Sutcliffe (The Beatles' first bass player) which were all major factors in Lennon's early life. In the same year as Smith’s death the McCartney family moved to 20 Forthlin Road, which is only ¾ of a mile (1.2km) from Mendips. Lennon would later meet Paul McCartney {{for the first time at}} St. Peter's Church, where Smith was buried.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot was}} an {{original}} story by T. E. B. Clarke, {{a writer of}} both comedy and drama scripts for Ealing; his other screenplays for the studio include Hue <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> (1947), Against the Wind (1948), The Blue Lamp (1950), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953). Clarke was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government {{so that when the}} then-Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth to Princess Margriet of the Netherlands, the baby was born on international territory, thus not on Canadian territory (though not on Dutch territory), and would not lose her right to the throne. The airlift of food supplies into the Burgundian enclave was influenced by the flights of food and supplies during the Berlin Blockade of June 1948 – May 1949. The music for the film was composed by Georges Auric, who had been involved in several other productions for Ealing Studios.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps no {{director}} better displayed {{that spirit}} than the German-born Robert Siodmak, {{who had already}} made a score of films before his 1940 arrival in Hollywood. Working mostly on A features, he made eight films now regarded as classic-era film noirs (a figure matched only by Lang and Mann). In addition to The Killers, Burt Lancaster's debut and a Hellinger/Universal co-production, Siodmak's other important contributions to the genre include 1944's Phantom Lady (a top-of-the-line B and Woolrich adaptation), the ironically titled Christmas Holiday (1944), <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> of the City (1948). Criss Cross (1949), with Lancaster again the lead, exemplifies how Siodmak brought {{the virtues of the}} B-movie to the A noir. In addition to the relatively looser constraints on character and message at lower budgets, the nature of B production lent itself to the noir style for economic reasons: dim lighting saved on electricity and helped cloak cheap sets (mist and smoke also served the cause); night shooting was often compelled by hurried production schedules; plots with obscure motivations and intriguingly elliptical transitions were sometimes the consequence of hastily written scripts, of which there was not always enough time or money to shoot every scene. In Criss Cross, Siodmak achieved these effects with purpose, wrapping them around Yvonne De Carlo, playing the most understandable of femme fatales; Dan Duryea, in one of his many charismatic villain roles; and Lancaster as an ordinary laborer turned armed robber, doomed by a romantic obsession.|$|E

5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, <b>and</b> <b>cry</b> havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} proteins {{which make up}} the mammalian TTNFL are the Period (PER), and Cryptochrome (CRY) proteins, BMAL1, CLOCK, and casein kinase 1 epsilon. PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> levels are regulated by negative feedback, meaning that they repress their own transcription. BMAL1 and CLOCK work to increase PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> transcription by binding on the E-box domain upstream from the PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> gene coding sequences. The level of PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> proteins is regulated by casein kinase 1 through phosphorylation, which marks these proteins for degradation by the cell. Phosphorylation also hinders PER's ability to enter the nucleus by inducing a conformational change in its nuclear localization sequence. However, if CRY proteins bind to PER before this phosphorylation can occur, all three proteins stabilize into a complex that can enter the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> can work to inhibit their own transcription, while casein kinase 1 epsilon works to modulate the activity of BMAL1 and CLOCK through phosphorylation.|$|E

25|$|Emotional lability, another {{consequence}} of stroke, causes {{the person to}} switch quickly between emotional highs and lows and to express emotions inappropriately, for instance with an excess of laughing or crying {{with little or no}} provocation. While these expressions of emotion usually correspond to the person's actual emotions, a more severe form of emotional lability causes the affected person to laugh <b>and</b> <b>cry</b> pathologically, without regard to context or emotion.|$|E

25|$|Scotland {{produced}} a few punk bands of note, such as The Exploited, The Rezillos, The Skids, The Fire Engines, and the Scars. However, {{it was not}} until the post-punk era of the early 1980s, that Scotland really came into its own, with bands like Cocteau Twins, Orange Juice, The Associates, Simple Minds, Maggie Reilly, Annie Lennox (Eurythmics), Hue <b>and</b> <b>Cry,</b> Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Wet Wet Wet, Big Country, The Proclaimers and Josef K. Since the 1980s Scotland has produced several popular rock and alternative rock acts.|$|E
40|$|Like verbal language, {{laughter}} <b>and</b> <b>crying</b> are expressive forms belonging {{specifically to}} the human equipment. But their violent and uncontrollable manifestations distance them clearly from verbal expression, which is elegant, multiform, and restrained. Moreover, laughter <b>and</b> <b>crying</b> are opaque: they cannot be connected with a specific mood or a specific cause; and, therefore, they {{are very different from}} sign language or miming. The specific features of laughter <b>and</b> <b>crying</b> have their foundations in human nature. Man is the (unique?) living being that {{is at the same time}} so near and so distant from his own self. In his psychophysical neutrality, man “lives through a break”. Laughter <b>and</b> <b>crying</b> are “to the limit” kinds of conduct and they reveal precisely man’s “eccentric” nature, his connection with his body but also his ability to transcend it...|$|R

In Nottingham, he made another fateful meeting, with a Mrs. Sue Thompson, who would become his mistress, but would eventually betray his whereabouts to the police (who denied her the £100 reward on the grounds that her evidence did not lead directly to Peace's conviction).|$|E
25|$|Television showing skaters in {{the kiss}} <b>and</b> <b>cry</b> area after {{competing}} {{contributed to the}} sport's popularity.

In May 1990, the International Skating Union voted to allow skaters who were intending to skate professionally to return to ISU competition if they obtained their national association's permission. To retain skaters who might otherwise have given up their eligibility to participate in lucrative professional events, in 1995 the ISU introduced prize money at its major competitions, funded by revenues from selling the TV rights to those events.|$|E
25|$|The Ealing comedies of the 1940s and 1950s made {{repeated}} use {{of locations}} in the city. Hue <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> (1947) and Passport to Pimlico (1949) were memorably set in the ruins and bombsites of post-war London. In the 1950s The Lavender Hill Mob made extensive use of London locations, as did the dramas The Blue Lamp and Pool of London, while The Ladykillers used King's Cross Station and its surrounding marshalling yards as the backdrop to its story. The 1952 film The Happy Family is set on the South Bank during the lead up to the Festival of Britain.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the associations among}} interpersonal dependency, social support, <b>and</b> <b>crying</b> proneness, since crying is a behavior that is particularly relevant to the affiliative interpersonal goals characterizing maladaptive forms of dependency (Keltner & Kring, 1998). Data were collected from 305 first-year university students (M age = 18 years). A series of hierarchical linear regressions, controlling for gender, commuting status, romantic relationship status, stress, loneliness, and depressive symptoms, partially supported our hypotheses. That is, we found that a measure of maladaptive dependency (destructive overdependence, or DO) <b>and</b> <b>crying</b> proneness were positively correlated, and that DO moderated the associations between social support <b>and</b> <b>crying</b> proneness. Specifically, we found that social support <b>and</b> <b>crying</b> were more closely positively associated among individuals high on DO compared to individuals low on DO. Our findings imply that interpersonal dependency {{may be an important}} factor in understanding individual differences in <b>crying,</b> <b>and</b> in determining whether crying is a successful elicitor of social support...|$|R
