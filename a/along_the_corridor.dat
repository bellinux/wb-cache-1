5|$|Didsbury {{is served}} by several bus routes into Manchester city centre, The Trafford Centre, Northenden, and other destinations. Wilmslow Road {{provides}} Didsbury with a regular bus service due to the strong demand for travel by students <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> The service is cheap and passengers rarely have to wait {{more than a couple}} of minutes. According to some analysts, Wilmslow Road is the busiest bus corridor in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Except for the Q53, all buses <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> end {{northbound}} {{service at}} Queens and Woodhaven Boulevards, at the Woodhaven Boulevard subway station of the IND Queens Boulevard Line {{and at the}} foot of Queens Center mall. Buses reenter service in a dedicated bus stop area on Hoffman Drive adjacent to the south side of Queens Boulevard. The Q53 serves these stops on its through service to or from Woodside.|$|E
5|$|While {{residents}} {{along the}} NY63 corridor {{are against the}} increased truck traffic <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> (spurred by the North American Free Trade Agreement), most of those same residents, along with other groups, also fought the proposed expressway. The general consensus {{of all of these}} groups is that NYSDOT should impose restrictions on the NY63 corridor and force trucks to remain on I-390 and the Thruway to travel between Buffalo and Pennsylvania.|$|E

50|$|Amtrak {{operates}} {{two local}} routes: the Northeast Regional and Keystone Service. The Northeast Regional travels <b>along</b> <b>the</b> full length of <b>the</b> Northeast <b>Corridor</b> (except {{for a few}} trains which travel to Springfield, Massachusetts). From Washington, some extended service travels to Virginia as far as Newport News or Lynchburg. The Keystone Service travels <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Northeast <b>Corridor,</b> and continues <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Keystone <b>Corridor</b> past 30th Street Station. While certain trains only travel <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Keystone <b>Corridor,</b> others continue past Philadelphia to New York.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, {{in order}} to add four {{additional}} Amtrak trips <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor,</b> four of the then six round trips to New London were cut back to Old Saybrook. An agreement with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection limits service over the Old Saybrook-Old Lyme bridge {{in order to}} avoid inconveniencing recreational boaters. ConnDOT's agreement with Amtrak allowed commuters with monthly passes to ride certain Amtrak trains instead. After criticism over the service cuts, in April 2008 ConnDOT began allowing commuters with multi-ride passes to board the selected Amtrak trains as well.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Congressman William J. Hughes {{proposed}} a freeway along the US 40 corridor {{in order to}} alleviate increased traffic along that route following the legalization of gambling in Atlantic City. This freeway, {{which was to be}} maintained by the New Jersey Expressway Authority, was to run from the Delaware Memorial Bridge east to Atlantic City. The NJDOT determined that the traffic volume on US 40 did not justify the construction of a freeway <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> The Cardiff Circle along US 40/US 322 at CR 563 and CR 608 in Egg Harbor Township was eliminated in a $3.7 million project completed in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has {{identified}} the NY146 corridor from Riverview Road to Glen Ridge Road as {{in need of}} future improvements. Intersection improvements are scheduled at the NY146/ Aqueduct Road/ Williams Road and NY146/ Riverview Road intersections. This {{part of the project}} will be built in 2008 and is to include new turn lanes at each intersection. To the south, the Rexford Bridge over the Mohawk River and the surrounding roadway will be improved in stages, with completion expected by 2017. The objective of these projects is to improve highway capacity and safety <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of I-68 began in 1965 and continued for over 25years, with completion on August 2, 1991. While {{the road was}} under construction, {{it was predicted that}} economic conditions would improve <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> for the five counties connected by I-68: Allegany, Garrett, and Washington in Maryland, and Preston and Monongalia in West Virginia. The two largest cities connected by the highway are Morgantown, West Virginia, and Cumberland, Maryland. Although the freeway serves no major metropolitan areas, it provides a major transportation route in western Maryland and northern West Virginia and also provides an alternative to the Pennsylvania Turnpike for westbound traffic from Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} part of the {{original}} Second Avenue Subway as outlined in the Program for Action in 1968. Construction on that project started in 1972, but stalled in 1975 due to lack of funding. In 2007, a separate measure authorized a first phase of the Second Avenue Line to be built between 65th and 105th Streets, with stations at 72nd, 86th, and 96th Streets. The station opened on January 1, 2017, as an intermediate station along Phase 1. Since opening, the presence of the Second Avenue Subway's three Phase 1 stations has improved real estate prices <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b>|$|E

5|$|When the Interstate Highway {{system was}} in the {{planning}} stages, the western terminus of I-70 was proposed to be at Denver. The portion west of Denver was included into the plans after lobbying by Governor Edwin C. Johnson, for whom one of the tunnels along I-70 is named. East of Idaho Springs, I-70 was built <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> of U.S. Highway40, {{one of the original}} transcontinental U.S. Highways. West of Idaho Springs, I-70 was built along the route of U.S. Highway6, which was extended into Colorado during the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Woodhaven-Cross Bay {{corridor}} was one {{of twelve}} Queens bus corridors studied under the city's bus rapid transit (BRT) study, which was meant to determine the feasibility of having dedicated lanes and rebuilt stops to speed up service on BRT corridors. Beginning on January 4, 2008, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) conducted an 18-month study on Woodhaven Boulevard {{as part of the}} city's Congested Corridors Project to improve congested and dangerous roadways. One of the short-term recommendations {{of the study was to}} implement bus rapid transit <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> In June 2010, the Woodhaven-Cross Bay corridor was added to the list of potential corridors for Phase II of Select Bus Service (SBS), the MTA's brand of BRT service.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{all three}} routes had their {{operations}} {{taken over by}} the MTA Bus Company brand of MTA Regional Bus Operations. The Q53 originally was a premium fare service, with a long nonstop segment between Rego Park to Broad Channel, as it was a replacement service for rail. Soon after the MTA's takeover of the route, it was converted to be a limited-stop service, with six stops <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> Subsequently, the Q21 was extended up Woodhaven Boulevard, and its southern terminus in the Rockaways was switched. Increased ridership resulted {{in the creation of the}} Q21 Limited, which was soon replaced by the Q52 Limited, which replaced Q21 service south of Howard Beach.|$|E

5|$|Since 1996, {{the upper}} Caroline Street {{corridor}} and Key West Bight {{have been part}} of ongoing improvement efforts spearheaded by the City of Key West and funded by a special property tax system. At the beginning of the project, the area, once dominated by commercial fishing, had been falling into disarray as its practical future became uncertain. The dynamics of the project changed throughout its course; in early 2011, the city approved spending for specific updates to infrastructure <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor,</b> including improved lighting and signs, a more extensive sidewalk system, and versatility with regard to bicycle and pedestrian traffic. As recently as February 2012, additional requests for improvements were lodged with $720,000 available for the project.|$|E
5|$|The Tunnel of Light is {{an artistic}} display {{of color and}} sound {{surrounding}} the escalator at the station. 1800 fluorescent lamps and 44 speakers are installed behind a layer of glass <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor,</b> steadily changing color and mood. The theme is based on different experiences of travel in time and place. There are light and sound combinations for all seasons and all phases of life. The project was initiated by Kristin Jarmund. The light system was developed by Per Åge Lyså at Intravision System, and the software that mixes sound and color was developed by Yngve Sandboe. The music was composed by Bjarne Kvinnsland, mainly based on recorded samples. Among these are text written and performed by Beate Grimsrud.|$|E
