Mulder shares with Scully his belief that both the culprits in both the current case and Hoover's investigation are werewolves. Scully dismisses this theory and instead credits the belief to clinical lycanthropy. The elder Parker is subsequently ripped apart by an unseen animal outside his home, and Lyle is found naked <b>and</b> <b>unconscious</b> {{a few hundred yards}} away.|$|E

They attempted to resuscitate {{her and she was}} transported to the Humana Northside Hospital. Paramedics had her intubated and ventilated.|$|E
5|$|Stealth {{is based}} on {{limiting}} the player character's visibility; hiding behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' cone of vision, and avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection. When hiding behind an object, the player can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop, {{and as long as}} Corvo remains hidden, his enemies will not see him. The player can also look through keyholes to gain insight into closed rooms. Sneaking up behind enemies allows the player to silently subdue them, <b>and</b> <b>unconscious</b> or dead bodies can be moved and hidden.|$|E
50|$|Carl Jung further expounded Freud’s {{view of the}} <b>unconscious</b> <b>and</b> {{categorized}} the <b>unconscious</b> {{into the}} personal <b>unconscious</b> <b>and</b> the collective <b>unconscious.</b> He believed that the personal <b>unconscious</b> held memories <b>and</b> experiences specific to every individual <b>and</b> the collective <b>unconscious</b> held memories, predispositions and experiences of a species which are passed on {{from generation to generation}} and are shared among all the individuals of a species.|$|R

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, after being in a car accident, Reyes awakens in a surreal hospital. Doggett and a comatose Reyes struggle to prevent her organ donor card from being acted upon. The two, however, soon discover a unique woman, Audrey Pauley, who {{has the ability to}} communicate with both those conscious <b>and</b> <b>unconscious.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1999, while {{a sophomore}} at Pennsylvania State University, Parker and his roommate and wrestling teammate, Jean McGianni Celestin, were accused of raping a fellow student. The unnamed accuser stated that Parker and Celestin raped her while she was {{intoxicated}} <b>and</b> <b>unconscious,</b> {{and that she was}} unsure of how many people had been involved. The woman later went to a doctor, who concluded that she had been sexually assaulted, and local authorities taped a phone conversation between her and Parker in which Parker confirmed that it was he and Celestin who had sex with her. She also stated that the two harassed her after she pressed charges, and that they hired a private investigator who showed her picture around campus, revealing her identity.|$|E
5|$|Aboard the Anesidora, Ripley discovers {{a message}} from her mother after her initial report of the events on the Nostromo, thus finally giving her closure. Marlow then appears with Taylor and tells Ripley {{that he plans to}} {{overload}} the Anesidoras fusion reactor and destroy the station, thus ensuring that no aliens survive. In the ensuing confrontation, Taylor kills Marlow and is herself killed by an electric discharge while Ripley is forced to escape the Anesidora shortly before it explodes. Ricardo tells Ripley that the Anesidora explosion destroyed Sevastopol's orbital stabilisers, causing the station to slowly drift into KG348's atmosphere. Ripley and Ricardo contact the Torrens for extraction, but a facehugger paralyses Ricardo, forcing Ripley to leave him. After making her way outside to help the Torrens detach from the station, Ripley is surrounded by several alien creatures and then thrown into the ship due to a blast. Aboard the Torrens, Ripley discovers that another alien has boarded the ship. Still in her EVA suit, Ripley is cornered in the airlock and left with no option but to open it, which ejects both her and the alien into space. The final shot of the game depicts Ripley adrift <b>and</b> <b>unconscious</b> in her EVA suit, then suddenly awakened by a searchlight that crosses her face.|$|E
50|$|In his studies, Carl Jung {{divided the}} psyche into the <b>un{{conscious}}</b> <b>and</b> the conscious minds. Freud viewed the unconscious as containing the Id, the Superego and the Ego, whereas Jung developed a different model. He described the unconscious as {{consisting of two}} major components: the Personal <b>Unconscious</b> <b>and</b> the Collective <b>Unconscious</b> (Quenk 2002).|$|R

5|$|Regarding {{the primary}} {{function}} of conscious processing, a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing {{that would otherwise}} be independent. This has been called the integration consensus. Another example has been proposed by Gerald Edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant connections that reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner. Edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with non-human animals (see Neural correlates section above). These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect. Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious. For a review of the differences between conscious <b>and</b> <b>unconscious</b> integrations, see the article of E. Morsella.|$|E
