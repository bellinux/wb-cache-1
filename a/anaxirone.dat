40|$|<b>Anaxirone,</b> a rationally {{synthesised}} triepoxide derivative, {{was given}} to 46 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Good risk patients received 800 mg/m(2) as a rapid intravenous injection every 4 weeks, whereas poor risk patients received 650 mg/m(2). Of 46 patients, 45 were evaulable for toxicity and 42 for efficacy analysis. There were 37 / 45 patients with poor risk, showing no difference in toxicity as compared to good risk patients. The major toxic effect was myelosuppression with 34 % of all patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 leucopenia; thrombocytopenia was less frequent. Locoregional phlebitis occurred in 66 % of the patients. There was no objective tumour response to <b>anaxirone</b> in 42 evaluable patients. Only 4 patients achieved stabilisation of the disease lasting maximally up to 248 days. <b>Anaxirone</b> is inactive in metastatic colorectal cancer...|$|E
40|$|Sixteen {{patients}} with advanced ovarian carcinoma {{were treated with}} <b>anaxirone</b> (1, 2, 4 -trigycidyl urazol, TGU), 600 mg/m 2 every 4 weeks. <b>Anaxirone</b> was the second or later line of therapy. All patients had evaluable tumors and evidence of failure of prior therapy. None of the patients responded. Two had stabilization of the disease for 4 months. In one patient WHO grade 4 leukopenia and grade 4 thrombocytopenia were observed after the second TGU cycle starting on day 41 and persisted until the patient died due to tumor progression (day 50). No patient experienced thrombophlebitis. Â© 1987. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
