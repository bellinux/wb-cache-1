He concluded, though, that there would also be attacks in other locations, such as Norway or the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|During the trial, the {{defendant}} Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements. He said that Muslims were monsters {{to him and}} asked the court why they were not deported after the 9/11 attacks. He stated that German people should not mingle with foreigners <b>and</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> he would vote for the far right National Democratic Party of Germany. The judge then requested a verbatim record, while the defence counsel tried to mediate. Wiens continued in this fashion, prompting the judge to ask whether he had ever visited a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|Henry's plans shifted {{when the}} Empress Matilda's husband, the Emperor Henry, died in 1125. King Henry {{recalled}} {{his daughter to}} England the next year <b>and</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that,</b> should he die without a male heir, {{she was to be}} his rightful successor. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have. Putting forward a woman as a potential heir in this way was unusual: opposition to Matilda continued to exist within the English court, and Louis was vehemently opposed to her candidacy.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, in the lead-up to {{the release}} of the first Harry Potter film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone; Warner Bros., the film's distributor, sent a series of letters to owners of Harry Potter fansites, {{demanding}} that, to protect their copyright, they hand over their domain names. The action resulted in negative publicity for the company when Claire Field, the then 15-year-old webmaster of the British fansite harrypotterguide.co.uk, was reduced to tears by what were described by her father as unnecessary bully tactics. Eventually the corporation backed down in the face of media opposition <b>and</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that,</b> as the site was non-commercial, it did not violate the trademark.|$|E
5|$|In October 1943, General Hansell was {{appointed}} {{chief of the}} Combined and Joint Staff Division, in the Office of the Assistant Chief of Air Staff for Plans, located at Headquarters USAAF. As such he became Air Planner on the Joint Planning Staff. He immediately affected planning of strategic air attacks on Japan. The JPS draft outline denigrated strategic bombing <b>and</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> an invasion of the home islands was {{the only means of}} defeating Japan, but Hansell successfully argued that an invasion should only be a contingency if bombing and a sea blockade of Japan failed to compel a surrender.|$|E
5|$|On 28 September 1961, secessionist army units {{launched}} a coup in Damascus, declaring Syria's secession from the UAR. In response, pro-union army units in northern Syria revolted and pro-Nasser protests occurred in major Syrian cities. Nasser sent Egyptian special forces to Latakia {{to bolster his}} allies, but withdrew them two days later, citing a refusal to allow inter-Arab fighting. Addressing the UAR's breakup on 5 October, Nasser accepted personal responsibility <b>and</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> Egypt would recognize an elected Syrian government. He privately blamed interference by hostile Arab governments. According to Heikal, Nasser suffered something resembling a nervous breakdown after {{the dissolution of the}} union; he began to smoke more heavily and his health began to deteriorate.|$|E

5|$|The Brabant Revolution {{broke out}} on 24 October 1789 when the émigré patriot army under Van der Mersch {{crossed over the}} Dutch border into the Austrian Netherlands. The army, which {{numbered}} 2,800 men, crossed into the Kempen region south of Breda. The army arrived {{in the town of}} Hoogstraten where a specially prepared document, the Manifesto of the People of Brabant (Manifeste du peuple brabançon), was read in the city hall. The document denounced Joseph II's rule <b>and</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> he no longer held legitimacy. The text of the speech itself was an embellished version of the 1581 declaration (the Verlatinge) by the Dutch States-General denouncing Philip II's rule in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{dispute in}} 1885 {{concerned}} Game 2, which was forfeited by St. Louis when they pulled their team {{off the field}} protesting an umpiring decision. The managers, Cap Anson and Charles Comiskey, initially agreed to disregard the game. When St. Louis won the final game and an apparent 3–2 Series championship, Chicago White Stockings owner Albert Spalding overruled his manager <b>and</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> he wanted the forfeit counted. The result of a tied Series was that neither team got the prize money that had been posted by the owners before the Series (and was returned to them after they both agreed it was a tie).|$|E
5|$|The laws of {{the game}} are {{determined}} by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). The board was formed in 1886 after a meeting in Manchester of The Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales, and the Irish Football Association. FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 <b>and</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association. The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the International Football Association Board in 1913. The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.|$|E

5|$|According to Byzantine custom, the {{coronation}} of an emperor could only {{take place in}} Constantinople and be performed by the Patriarch; yet Constantinople was still in Latin hands, and the Patriarch (now Germanus II, 1223–40) resided in Nicaea. Theodore thus turned to the Metropolitan of Thessalonica, Constantine Mesopotamites, whom he had just restored to his see after removing the Latin prelate. Mesopotamites however recognized the Patriarch at Nicaea as legitimate, and steadfastly refused to perform the rite, despite pressure from Theodore, his brother Constantine, and John Apokaukos. Rather than submit, he preferred to return to exile. In response, in March 1225 Theodore convened a council of the bishops of his domains at Arta, chaired by Apokaukos. The council approved a declaration, composed by Apokaukos, which extolled Theodore's achievements against the Latins and Bulgarians, his liberation of Greek lands, eviction of Catholic priests and restoration of Orthodox bishops, and his imperial descent, <b>and</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> the council recognized only him as emperor. Armed with this declaration, Theodore had the loyal Archbishop of Ohrid, Demetrios Chomatianos, perform {{the coronation}} instead.|$|E
5|$|After a bloodless {{skirmish}} between Serb {{insurgents and}} Croatian special police in March, the JNA itself, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the Federal Presidency {{to give it}} wartime authorities and declare a state of emergency. The request was denied on 15 March, and the JNA came {{under the control of}} Serbian President Slobodan Milošević. Milošević, preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army <b>and</b> <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> he no longer recognized the authority of the Federal Presidency. By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA stepped in, increasingly supporting the Croatian Serb insurgents, and preventing Croatian police from intervening. In early April, the leaders of the Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control, known as SAO Krajina, with Serbia. The Government of Croatia viewed this declaration as an attempt to secede.|$|E
