40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: In this {{dissertation}} {{we study}} several problems in directed graphs. First {{we consider the}} problem of computing the 2 -vertex-connected components of directed graphs. We present a new algorithm for solving this problem in O(nm) time and we consider three applications of this algorithm. Let G=(V,E) be a directed graph. A 2 -directed block in G is a maximal vertex set C^ 2 d⊆ V with |C^ 2 d|≥ 2 such that for each pair of distinct vertices x,y ∈ C^ 2 d there exist two vertex-disjoint paths from x to y and two vertex-disjoint paths from y to x in G. We present two algorithms for computing the 2 -directed blocks of G in O(m,(t_sap+t_sb) n n) time, where t_sap {{is the number of}} strong <b>articulation</b> <b>points</b> of G and t_sb is the number of strong bridges of G. 	Furthermore, we study two related concepts: the 2 -strong blocks and the 2 -edge blocks of G. We give two algorithms for computing the 2 -strong blocks of G in O(m,t_sap n n) time and we show that the 2 -edge blocks of G can be computed in O(m, t_sb n n) time. We also study some optimization problems related to the strong <b>articulation</b> <b>points</b> and the 2 -blocks of a directed graph. Given a strongly connected graph G=(V,E), we want to find a minimum strongly connected spanning subgraph G^*=(V,E^*) of G such that the strong <b>articulation</b> <b>points</b> of G coincide with the strong <b>articulation</b> <b>points</b> of G^*. We show that there is a linear time 17 / 3 -approximation algorithm for this NP-hard problem. We also consider the problem of finding a minimum strongly connected spanning subgraph with the same 2 -blocks in a strongly connected graph G. We present approximation algorithms for three versions of this problem, {{depending on the type of}} 2 -blocks. 	Unlike 2 -vertex-connected components, removing the strong <b>articulation</b> <b>points</b> of G that do not belong to the 2 -directed blocks of G may change these blocks. We study the problem of finding a minimum cardinality subset V^* of strong <b>articulation</b> <b>points</b> that are not in these blocks such that the removal of V^* has the same effect. Moreover, we study other versions of this problem depending on the type of 2 -blocks. A directed graph G=(V,E) is called singly-connected if for each pair of vertices v,w ∈ V there is at most one simple path from v to w in G. Buchsbaum and Carlisle (1993) gave an algorithm for testing whether G is singly-connected in O(n^ 2) time. Here we describe a refined version of this algorithm with running time O(s· t+m), where s and t are the number of sources and sinks, respectively, in the reduced graph G^r obtained by first contracting each strongly connected component of G into one vertex and then eliminating vertices of indegree or outdegree 1 by a contraction operation. Moreover, we show that the problem of finding a minimum cardinality edge subset C⊆ E (respectively, vertex subset F⊆ V) whose removal from G leaves a singly-connected graph is NP-hard...|$|R
5000|$|The book {{thickness}} {{of a given}} graph [...] is at most one {{if and only if}} [...] is an outerplanar graph. An outerplanar graph is a graph that has a planar embedding in which all vertices belong to the outer face of the embedding. For such a graph, placing the vertices in the same order along the spine as they appear in the outer face provides a one-page book embedding of the given graph. (An <b>articulation</b> <b>point</b> of the graph will necessarily appear more than once in the cyclic ordering of vertices around the outer face, but only one of those copies {{should be included in the}} book embedding.) Conversely, a one-page book embedding is automatically an outerplanar embedding.

5000|$|Desmatosuchus had blunt, bulbous, {{slightly}} recurved teeth. Furthermore, {{they are}} believed to have had homodont dentition. This, combined with its shovel like snout, indicate that Desmatosuchus fed by digging up soft vegetation. This method of feeding is further evidenced by its toothless premaxilla and dentary tip, which were covered in horny sheaths. These sheaths protected the bones and could be used for cutting or holding objects. It is believed that Desmatosuchus dug for food in the soft mud near bodies of water due to the abundance of lakes and rivers in the Dockum area and the fact that Desmatosuchus scutes are often found among parts of other reptiles that are known to have fed along waterways. It is unknown whether or not Desmatosuchus replaced their teeth and, if so, how. The low number of Desmatosuchus teeth that have been discovered indicates that they were only held in place by soft tissue connections. The jaw <b>articulation</b> <b>point</b> is below the tooth line, holding its upper and lower tooth rows parallel while biting {{in a way that is}} reminiscent of ornithischian dinosaurs. [...] The armor and spikes of Desmatosuchus were its only ways to defend itself from predators. The lateral spike rows showed variation in size among individuals, especially the second most anterior spike. This spike was always shorter than the one in front of it, but to what extent varied drastically. This variation may indicate sexual dimorphism. It has also been hypothesized as a form of sexual display. Aside from this armor, Desmatosuchus was defenseless from attacks from carnivores. Several Desmatosuchus bones have been found amongst skeletons of Postosuchus, indicating predation by Postosuchus. The herd nature of Desmatosuchus apparently did little to discourage predators, as Postosuchus along with several other Late Triassic carnivores also traveled in groups.|$|E
