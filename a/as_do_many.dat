5|$|Symmetry is {{pervasive}} in living things. Animals mainly have bilateral or mirror symmetry, {{as do the}} leaves of plants and some flowers such as orchids. Plants often have radial or rotational symmetry, <b>as</b> <b>do</b> <b>many</b> flowers and some groups of animals such as sea anemones. Fivefold symmetry {{is found in the}} echinoderms, the group that includes starfish, sea urchins, and sea lilies.|$|E
5|$|Halotus died {{close to}} the end of the century, his public {{reputation}} somewhat restored after his rise in stature and wealth. His date of death is not mentioned by ancient historians of the time, such as Tacitus or Suetonius, who were also some of the main recorders of the events around Claudius' death and the political trauma that followed. Whether Halotus was involved in the murder of Claudius and to what extent remains an unresolved point, <b>as</b> <b>do</b> <b>many</b> other aspects related to Claudius' passing.|$|E

5|$|The 2000 census gave a total {{population}} of 474,490, of whom 387,124 were ethnic Tibetans. The Han Chinese population {{at the time was}} mainly concentrated in urban areas. The prefecture-level city is traversed by two major highways and by the Qinghai–Tibet Railway, which terminates in the city of Lhasa. Two large dams on the Lhasa River deliver hydroelectric power, <b>as</b> <b>do</b> <b>many</b> smaller dams and the Yangbajain Geothermal Station. The population is well-served by primary schools and basic medical facilities, although more advanced facilities are lacking. Tibetan Buddhism and monastic life have been dominant aspects of the local culture since the 7th century. Most of the monasteries were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, but since then many have been restored and serve as tourist attractions.|$|E
25|$|Today, the {{exterior}} doors of most large (especially public) buildings open outward, while interior doors such as doors to individual rooms, offices, suites, etc. open inward, <b>as</b> <b>do</b> <b>many</b> exterior doors of houses, particularly in North America.|$|E
25|$|Many of the Victorian fortifications exist, <b>as</b> <b>do</b> <b>many</b> German ones in a demilitarised form, {{having been}} {{stripped}} of metal in a scrap metal drive after World War II.

25|$|Because Blake's later poetry {{contains}} a private mythology with complex symbolism, his late {{work has been}} less published than his earlier more accessible work. The Vintage anthology of Blake edited by Patti Smith focuses heavily on the earlier work, <b>as</b> <b>do</b> <b>many</b> critical studies such as William Blake by D. G. Gillham.|$|E
25|$|Among other {{languages}} associated with Mizrahim are Judeo-Iranian languages such as Judeo-Persian, the Bukhori dialect, Judeo-Tat, and Kurdish languages; Georgian; Marathi; and Judeo-Malayalam.

25|$|Various {{departments}} of state governments may {{have their own}} enforcement divisions, such as capitol police, campus police, state hospitals, Departments of Correction, water police, environmental (fish and game/wildlife) game wardens or conservation officers (who have full police powers and statewide jurisdiction).

25|$|The {{structure}} of TEV protease has been solved by X-ray crystallography. It {{is composed of}} two β-barrels and a flexible C-terminal tail and displays structural homology to the chymotrypsin superfamily of proteases (PA clan, C4 family by MEROPS classification). Although homologous to cellular serine proteases (such as trypsin, elastase, thrombin etc.), TEV protease uses a cysteine as its catalytic nucleophile (<b>as</b> <b>do</b> <b>many</b> other viral proteases).|$|E

All of these products can release organic compounds during usage, and, to some degree, when they are stored.

25|$|The lack of {{implementation}} of referendums {{has led to}} calls for such referendums to be made binding on {{the government of the}} day, similar to the direct democracy seen in Switzerland. Both the New Zealand First Party and the Kiwi Party advocate binding referendums, along with the Better Democracy group. However, neither are currently represented within the New Zealand Parliament, and former New Zealand Prime Minister John Key opposed binding referenda, <b>as</b> <b>do</b> <b>many</b> legal academics and members of New Zealand's LGBT communities.|$|E
25|$|Since {{they were}} not trained in {{building}} design, the padres could only try to emulate the architectural aspects of structures they remembered from their homeland. The missions exhibit a strong Roman influence in much of their design and construction techniques (<b>as</b> <b>do</b> <b>many</b> buildings in Spain), particularly in arch and dome construction. At Mission Santa Barbara, founding Father Ripali {{even went so far}} as to consult the works of 1st century B.C. Roman architect Vitruvius during the design phase of the project.|$|E
25|$|Polistes erythrocephalus is {{a species}} of paper wasp in the {{subfamily}} Polistinae of family Vespidae found in Central and South America. P. erythrocephalus is a eusocial wasp, meaning that it possesses both reproductive and non-reproductive castes. The cooperation between the two castes to raise young demonstrates the altruistic nature of these wasps. P. erythrocephalus exhibits a four-stage colony cycle, <b>as</b> <b>do</b> <b>many</b> other Polistes wasps. This species generally feeds on larvae, occasionally their own, and is preyed upon by species such as army ants.|$|E
