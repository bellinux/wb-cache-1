It works like local optimization, {{but it may}} keep a change even if it worsens the result. The chance of keeping such a change is , where [...] is {{the change in the}} evaluation function, and [...] is the temperature. The temperature is gradually lowered according to the annealing schedule. When the temperature is high, simulated annealing performs almost random changes to the label placement, being able to escape a local optimum. Later, when hopefully a very good local optimum has been found, it behaves {{in a manner similar to}} local optimization. The main challenges in developing a simulated <b>annealing</b> <b>solution</b> are choosing a good evaluation function and a good annealing schedule. Generally too fast cooling will degrade the solution, and too slow cooling will degrade the performance, but the schedule is usually quite a complex algorithm, with more than just one parameter.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} bifurcation processes for the mean field theory (MFT) annealing applied to traveling salesman problems (TSPs). Due to the symmetries of the TSP free energy function, some special bifurcations occur: cyclic symmetry breaking bifurcations and reverse symmetry breaking bifurcations. Saddle-node bifurcations also occur. Which type of bifurcations occurs {{depends on the}} symmetry of the eigenvector that corresponds to the zero eigenvalue mode of the free energy curvature matrix at the bifurcation point. In the MFT annealing process, a sequence of bifurcations occurs and the bifurcation structure affects {{the quality of the}} <b>annealing</b> <b>solution.</b> It is shown that the <b>annealing</b> <b>solution</b> in this process is not unique in general, and it is not always the optimal solution.

40|$|Abstract—Information-based {{distortion}} {{methods have}} been used successfully {{in the analysis of}} neural coding problems. These approaches allow the discovery of neural symbols and the corresponding stimulus space of a neuron or neural ensemble quantitatively, while making few assumptions about the nature of either the code or of relevant stimulus features. The neural codebook is derived by quantizing sensory stimuli and neural responses into a small set of clusters, and optimizing the quantization to minimize an information distortion function. The method of annealing has been used to solve the corresponding high-dimensional nonlinear optimization problem. The <b>annealing</b> <b>solutions</b> undergo a series of bifurcations, which we study using bifurcation theory in the presence of symmetries. In this contribution we describe these symmetry breaking bifurcations in detail, and indicate some of the consequences of the form of the bifurcations. In particular, we show that the <b>annealing</b> <b>solutions</b> break symmetry at pitchfork bifurcations, and that subcritical branches can exist. Thus, at a subcritical bifurcation, there are local information distortion solutions which are not found by the method of annealing. Since the annealing procedure is guaranteed to converge to a local solution eventually, the subcritical branch must turn and become optimal at some later saddle-node bifurcation, which we have shown occur generically for this class of problems. This implies that the rate distortion curve, while convex for noninformation-based distortion measures, is not convex for information-based distortion methods.

40|$|Sensor nodes are {{inherently}} unreliable {{and prone to}} hardware or software faults. Thus, they may report untrustwor- thy or inconsistent data. Assessing the trustworthiness of sensor data items can allow reliable sensing or monitoring of physical phenomena. A provenance-based trust framework can evaluate the trustworthiness of data items and sensor nodes based on the intuition that two data items with similar data values but with different provenance (i. e., forwarding path) can be considered more trustworthy. Forwarding paths of data items generated from redundantly deployed sensors should consist of trustworthy nodes and remain dissimilar. Unfortunately, operating many sensors with dissimilar paths consumes significant energy. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem to identify a set of sensor nodes and their corresponding paths toward the base station that achieve a certain trustworthiness threshold, while keeping the energy consumption of the network minimal. We prove the NP-hardness of this problem and propose ERUPT, a simulated <b>annealing</b> <b>solution.</b> Testbed and simulation results show that ERUPT achieves high trustworthiness, while reducing total energy consumption by 32 - 50 % with respect to current approaches...|$|E

The {{results showed that}} the composite was integrated, uniform and compact, and its wear resistant property was better than that of the unreinforced matrix alloy.

Compared to <b>annealing,</b> <b>solution</b> aging strengthens Al alloy matrix and cohesion with SiCp, and the wear resistant property of composites was better. Combining interface is also an important factor which influences on wear resistant property. During the wear test, the smaller SiCp size, the more interfaces, there are more SiCp falling off because of loosening combining interface, which results in more wear-tearing value. The wear rate of composite increases with decreasing SiCp size, thus, the composite with larger SiCp has better wear-resistant property than that with smaller SiCp. At last, the wear mechanism of the composite was also studied, and it showed that abrasive wear dominated in the abrasion process...|$|E

The research then examined different move sets and cost metrics used with the annealer which directly affected the ability to successfully place and route. By treating signal to wire assignment as a placement operation, the annealer was able to perform routing integrated during placement. In this formulation the grade of a placement was the weight of the minimum spanning trees (or alternatively steiner tree approximations) constructed over the current signal to wire assignment graph. A working implementation of this tool, Hephaestus, was finally tested against several designs with the goal of finding the best move set and cost metric combination while gauging the viability of such a tool.

Laser processing parameters investigated include laser power (2 – 4 kW), welding speed (0. 75 – 7. 5 m/min), joint gap (0 – 0. 6 mm) and defocusing distance (- 1 mm and - 2 mm). Two post-weld heat treatments (i. e. stress relief <b>annealing,</b> <b>solution</b> treatment and aging) are investigated and compared with the as-welded condition. Although some welding defects such as underfill and porosity have been observed, high quality welds can be obtained using a high power Nd:YAG laser. Underfill defect is found to increase but the porosity area decreases with increasing welding speed. The use of the filler wire decreases the underfill defect. However, the porosity area increases with increasing joint gap. The hardness is maximum in the fusion zone (FZ) followed by a sharp decrease in the heat affected zone (HAZ) to the base metal (BM). The low temperature annealing process increases the hardness of the fusion zone but the combination of the high temperature solution treatment followed by aging decreases the fusion zone hardness almost to the base metal values. Tensile testing shows that the joint efficiency varies between 95 and 105 %. The porosity and underfill are the two main defects for failure in the FZ and HAZ, respectively.
