We compared soft tissue estimations from the GE Prodigy (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI) with the more recent iDXA (GE Healthcare) and developed translational equations to enable Prodigy values to be converted to iDXA values. Eighty-three males and females aged 20. 1 – 63. 3 yr and with a body mass index range of 17. 0 – 34. 4 kg/m 2 were recruited for the study. Fifty-nine participants (41 females and 18 males) comprised the cross-calibration group and 24 (14 females and 10 males) comprised the validation group. Total body Prodigy and iDXA scans were performed on each subject within 24 h. Predictive equations for total and regional soft tissue parameters were derived from linear regression of the data. Measures of lean and fat tissues were highly correlated (R 2 = 0. 95 – 0. 99), but significant differences and variability between machines were identified. Bland-Altman analysis revealed significant biases for most measures, particularly for arm, android, and gynoid fat mass (12. 3 %– 22. 7 %). The derived translational equations reduced biases and differences for most parameters, although limits of agreement exceeded iDXA least significant change. In conclusion, variability in soft tissue estimates between the Prodigy and iDXA were detected, supporting the need for translational equations in longitudinal monitoring.

Nearly all points fell on or near the lines in their graphs. Koo et al may have missed a golden opportunity to validate the use of radiology by assessing bone chemistry. Chemical analysis and radiodensity of bone have been compared only rarely (2). To illustrate, 31 vertebrae were removed from 11 fresh cadavers, scanned by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and converted to ash; radiologic measurements and ash were found to be correlated (3). Both ash and calcium correlated with radiologic mea-surements in 6 fetal human femurs (4). Limited data from animals also showed a correlation between radiologic measurements and bone ash (5 – 9). Ash is both nonspecific and chemically complex. Calcium re-ceives the greatest amount of radiologic attention in this context because of its radiodensity; however, correlations from only 6 ex-cised fetal femurs do not inspire confidence. Bones are complex organs, and it is important to provide evidence that radiodensity, which correlates well with fracture risk, also cor-relates with calcium, collagen or other proteins, phosphorus, or even trace elements in bone. For the most part, this evidence is lacking. Trace elements may be important: 2 supplementation trials (10, 11) found benefits of copper in adults with osteoporosis that comple-mented numerous similar data on osteoporosis in copper-deficient children (2). I hope that Koo et al removed femurs, radii, and vertebrae from the piglets for chemical analysis so that further studies can be conducted to improve the validity of bone density measurements and to clarify mechanisms of bone pathology...|$|R

A reference group contained 17 term infants. Body size is known to affect bone mineral content (BMC), therefore postnatal bone mineralisation was measured when the study infants and controls had attained a similar body size.

D., 33) months of treatment (1. 023 (0. 247) to 1. 017 (0. 246) g/cm). The annual percentage of change was positively related to both body weight (r= 0. 180; P= 0. 020) and radiocalcium absorption (r= 0. 185; P= 0. 017). Multiple linear regression confirmed that both variables contributed to the change in BMC (P= 0. 023 and 0. 019 respectively). The mean annual percentage of change in BMC on calcium therapy was not related to age, initial BMC, serum 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D or fasting urinary calcium/creatinine ratio. These results support our earlier studies which suggest that poor calcium absorption limits the response of bone to calcium supplements. Emma Smith, Allan G. Need, Christopher G.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between disease severity and bone density as well as vertebral fracture risk in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS [...] Measurements were taken for bone mineral density (BMD) and vertebral fracture rates in 87 patients with AS. BMD was measured at the hip (femoral neck -FN), lumbar spine (L 1 -L 4 -LS) and for the whole body using a hologic-QDR- 1000 /W <b>absorptiometer.</b> An algorithm based on normal female ranges of vertebral heights was used to define a fracture as occurring when two vertebral ratios were each three standard deviations below the calculated mean of the controls. RESULTS [...] Patients with AS had significantly lower FN-BMD in proportion to disease severity (based on a Schober index) and disease duration. LS-BMD was also reduced in early disease, but in patients with advanced AS it had increased considerably. Nine vertebral fractures (10. 3 %) were identified which was considerably higher than expected when compared with a fracture of 1. 9 % in a control population of 1035 females of a similar age range. Patients with AS with fractures were significantly older, more likely to be male, had longer disease duration and more advanced spinal limitation with less mobility. There was no significant reduction in lumbar spine or femoral neck bone density in the fracture group. CONCLUSIONS [...] Vertebral fractures that result from osteoporosis are a feature of longstanding AS. BMD used as a measure of osteoporosis of the spine in advanced AS is unreliable probably as a result of syndesmophyte formation and does not predict the risk of vertebral fracture. Alternative sites such as the neck of the femur should be used for sequential assessment of BMD in AS...|$|E
40|$|Breast density, the radiographically opaque {{fraction}} of the breast in a mammogram, {{is one of the}} strongest biomarkers of breast cancer risk. However, younger populations do not typically have mammograms due to radiation concerns. This study explored a commercially available dual-energy X-ray <b>absorptiometer</b> (DXA) sys-tem as a low-dose method to measure breast fibrogland-ular density in adolescent girls. Eighteen girls (13 - 14 years old) indicated their breast development according to Tanner and underwent three dedicated DXA scans, two of their left and one of their right breasts. Total projected breast area was manually delineated on each image and percent fibroglandular volume density (%FGV), absolute fibroglandular volume (FGV), total breast area, and volume were computed. It was possible to image breasts representing all five Tanner stages; %FGV ranged from 31. 9 % to 92. 2 %with amean of 71. 1 F 14. 8 %, whereas FGV ranged from 80 to 270 cm 3 with a mean of 168 F 54 cm 3. Left and right breast %FGV were highly correlated (rp = 0. 97, P < 0. 0001) and of the same magnitude (P = 0. 18). However, left total volume and FGV were larger than the right by 38 cm 3 (P = 0. 04) and 19 cm 3 (P = 0. 02), respectively. Total volume and FGV increased by Tanner stage, whereas %FGV did not. Our method had excellent precision for %FGV and moderate precision for FGV (root mean square SDs of 2. 4 % and 16. 6 cm 3). These pilot data indicate that dedicated DXA breast scans may be useful in studies exploring breast density in girls. (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2008; 17 (7) : 1709 – 13...|$|E
40|$|Hemodialysis {{patients}} exhibit {{insulin resistance}} (IR) in target organs such as liver, muscles, and adipose tissue. The {{aim of this}} study was to identify contributors to IR and to develop a model for predicting glucose intolerance in nondiabetic hemodialysis patients. After a 2 -h, 75 -g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), 34 hemodialysis patients were divided into groups with normal (NGT) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Indices of insulin sensitivity were derived from OGTT data. Measurements included liver and muscle fat infiltration and central adiposity by computed tomography scans, body composition by dual energy X-ray <b>absorptiometer,</b> sleep quality by full polysomnography, and functional capacity and quality of life (QoL) by a battery of exercise tests and questionnaires. Cut-off points, as well as sensitivity and specificity calculations were based on IR (insulin sensitivity index by Matsuda) using a receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. Fifteen patients were assigned to the IGT, and 19 subjects to the NGT group. Intrahepatic fat content and visceral adiposity were significantly higher in the IGT group. IR indices strongly correlated with sleep disturbances, visceral adiposity, functional capacity, and QoL. Visceral adiposity, O 2 desaturation during sleep, intrahepatic fat content, and QoL score fitted into the model for predicting glucose intolerance. A ROC curve analysis identified an intrahepatic fat content of > 3. 97 % (sensitivity, 100; specificity, 35. 7) as the best cutoff point for predicting IR. Visceral and intrahepatic fat content, as well as QoL and sleep seemed to be involved at some point in the development of glucose intolerance in hemodialysis patients. Means of reducing fat depots in the liver and splachnic area might prove promising in combating IR and cardiovascular risk in hemodialysis patients...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the levels of bone mineral density (BMD) of the whole body (WB) and {{proximal}} femurs of physically active men with spinal cord injuries (SCI) to nonactive men with spinal cord injuries. Also, the lean muscle mass (LMM) of active men with SCI was compared to the LMM of nonactive men with SCI. In addition, BMD values of the radii of physically active men with SCI were compared to that of able bodied men of the same age. The subjects N. 46 were between the age of 20 - 55 (μ= 37. 83 ± 6. 63 years), and were at least 2 years post spinal cord injury. Subjects with SCI were matched on similar level of lesion of the spinal cord, age, height, weight, and years post injury for the purpose of analyzing data. There were 14 active men with paraplegia and 14 nonactive men with paraplegia, 9 active men with quadriplegia and 9 nonactive men with quadriplegia. All BMD data was obtained utilizing a Hologic QDR 1000 W dual energy x-ray <b>absorptiometer.</b> A two-factor (level by group) analysis of variance revealed no significant difference for all sites (Whole body, Total hip, radii, LMM) comparing the active and nonactive men with SCI. T-scores and z-scores generated from the Ho logic QDR 1000 /W were analyzed using two-factor ANOVA (level by group). The active men with paraplegia had significantly higher BMD levels for all sites when compared to the other groups. These values may be explained by the number of incomplete injuries in the experimental group. Subjects in the physically active group did not clearly show a statistically significant difference on any of the dependent measures. However, values for the dependent measures were higher for the physically active group compared to the values of the nonactive group...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Several {{abnormalities}} in the GH {{response to}} pharmacological stimuli {{have been described}} in hyperthyroidism. Both normal and high serum IGF-I levels have been reported, {{as well as a}} decrease in IGF-I bioactivity. We have evaluated the GH response to GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) in hyperthyroid patients and the effects of hyperthyroidism on serum IGF-I levels. The possible relations between nutritional status, thyroid hormones and IGF-I levels were also investigated. We also studied the influence of long-term beta-adrenoceptor blockade on the GH response to GHRH in these patients. DESIGN: In 18 hyperthyroid patients and in 12 control subjects, GHRH (100 micrograms) was administered as an i. v. bolus injection. Eight hyperthyroid patients and 8 control subjects received 50 micrograms GHRH i. v. Seven hyperthyroid patients were reevaluated after beta-adrenoceptor blockade. IGF-I and albumin levels were measured initially in all hyperthyroid patients and control subjects. Body composition was determined in 11 hyperthyroid patients and in a group of 33 matched normal controls. PATIENTS: Hyperthyroid patients were compared to control subjects. MEASUREMENTS: GH, TSH and free T 4 were measured by immunofluorometric assay. IGF-I, total T 3 and total T 4 were measured by radioimmunoassay. Body composition was determined using a dual-energy X-ray <b>absorptiometer.</b> RESULTS: The GH response to 100 micrograms GHRH in hyperthyroid patients was blunted compared to control subjects. The mean peak GH levels and the area under the curve were significantly lower in hyperthyroid patients compared to control subjects (11 +/- 1 vs 27 +/- 5 micrograms/l and 820 +/- 113 vs 1879 +/- 355 micrograms/l 120 min, respectively; P < 0. 01). IGF-I levels were significantly reduced in hyperthyroid patients compared to controls (131 +/- 10 vs 201 +/- 16 micrograms/l, respectively; P < 0. 01). Ideal body weight, serum albumin levels and the lean body mass were also reduced in hyperthyroid patients. After beta-adrenoceptor blockade there were no changes in the blunted GH response to GHRH in hyperthyroid patients. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the blunted GH response to GHRH in hyperthyroidism is apparently not related to circulating IGF-I levels. It is possible that nutritional factors could {{play a role in the}} reduced circulating IGF-I levels found in these patients...|$|E
40|$|Background : Overuse {{injury to}} the patellar tendon (patellar tendinopathy) is {{a major reason for}} {{interrupted}} training and competition for elite athletes. In both sexes, the prevalence of unilateral and bilateral tendinopathy has been shown to differ. It has been proposed that bilateral pathology may have a different aetiology from unilateral pathology. Investigation of risk factors that may be unique to unilateral and bilateral patellar tendinopathy in female athletes may reveal insights into the aetiology of this condition. Objectives : To examine whether anthropometry, body composition, or muscle strength distinguished elite female basketball players with unilateral or bilateral patellar tendinopathy. Methods : Body composition, anthropometry, and muscle strength were compared in elite female basketball players with unilateral (n = 8), bilateral (n = 7), or no (n = 24) patellar tendinopathy. Body composition was analysed using a dual energy x ray <b>absorptiometer.</b> Anthropometric measures were assessed using standard techniques. Knee extensor strength was measured at 180 °/s using an isokinetic dynamometer. z scores were calculated for the unilateral and bilateral groups (using the no tendinopathy group as controls). z scores were tested against zero. Results : The tibia length to stature ratio was approximately 1. 3 (1. 3) SDs above zero in both the affected and non-affected legs in the unilateral group (p< 0. 05). The waist to hip ratio was 0. 66 (0. 78) SD above zero in the unilateral group (p< 0. 05). In the unilateral group, leg lean to total lean ratio was 0. 42 (0. 55) SD above zero (p< 0. 07), the trunk lean to total lean ratio was 0. 63 (0. 68) SD below zero (p< 0. 05), and leg fat relative to total fat was 0. 47 (0. 65) SD below zero (p< 0. 09). In the unilateral group, the leg with pathology was 0. 78 (1. 03) SD weaker during eccentric contractions (p< 0. 07). Conclusions: Unilateral patellar tendinopathy has identifiable risk factors whereas bilateral patellar tendinopathy may not. This suggests that the aetiology of these conditions may be different. However, interpretation must respect the limitation of small subject numbers. <br /...|$|E

Materials and methods: A total of 120  healthy female Sprague Dawley rats aged 6  months were divided into four groups: 1) sham-operated control (Sham group, n= 30); 2) ovariectomized (OVX group, n= 30); 3) ovariectomized rats supplemented with EVOO (OVX + Olive, n= 30); 4) ovariectomized rats supplemented with estrogen (OVX + E 2, n= 30). EVOO and estrogen were administered by oral gavage at a dose of 1  mL/ 100  g weight on a daily basis for 12  consecutive weeks. Twelve weeks later blood samples were obtained to detect the levels of calcium, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), malonyldialdehyde (MDA), and nitrate content. Dual energy X-ray <b>absorptiometer</b> measured bone mineral density (BMD) of ovariectomized Sprague Dawley rats that had been fed olive oil for 3  months. Blood samples from patients, who regularly consumed olive oil over a 1  year period were also used to measure carbohydrate antigen 125, carcino-embryonic antigen, α-fetoprotein, and carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9  levels. BMD of lumbar spine and left femur was also evaluated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results: Animal experiments showed that EVOO significantly increased BMD and decreased phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, IL- 6, MDA, and nitrate levels. However, it had no significant effect on the Ca 2 + level. In clinical follow-up, EVOO also improved patient BMD levels on L 3, L 4, and left femoral neck, and reduced carbohydrate antigen 125, α-fetoprotein, and carcino-embryonic antigen levels. But it had no significant effect on the carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9  level. Conclusion: EVOO illustrated significant anti-osteoporosis, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties in vivo. However, further studies are required to determine the active component(s) responsible for these effects. Keywords: olive oil, prevention, treatment, osteoporosis, artificial menopaus...|$|E

Body condition score was maintained between two and four on a 5 -point scale by varying food allowances quarterly. The impact of change in body weight (BW) and body composition on longevity was analysed using linear mixed models with random slopes and intercepts. On 31 July 2014, 10  years after study start, dogs were classified into three lifespan groups: 13 (33  %) Expected (≥ 9 to ≤ 12. 9  years), 15 (39  %) Long (≥ 13 to ≤ 15. 5  years) and 11 (28  %) Exceptional (≥ 15. 6  years) with five still alive. Gender and age at neutering were not associated with longevity (P ≥  0. 06). BW increased similarly for all lifespan groups up to age 9, thereafter, from 9 to 13  years, Exceptional dogs gained and Long-lifespan dogs lost weight (P =  0. 007). Dual-energy x-ray <b>absorptiometer</b> scans revealed that absolute fat mass increase was slower to age 13 for Long compared with Expected lifespan dogs (P =  0. 003) whilst all groups lost a similar amount of absolute lean mass (P >  0. 05). Percent fat increase and percent lean loss were slower, whilst the change in fat:lean was smaller, in both the Exceptional and Long lifespan compared with Expected dogs to age 13 (P ≤  0. 02). Total bone mineral density was significantly lower for Expected compared to Exceptional and Long lifespan dogs (P <  0. 04). This study shows that life-long maintenance of lean body mass and attenuated accumulation of body fat were key factors in achieving a longer lifespan. The results suggest that a combination of a high quality plane of nutrition with appropriate husbandry and healthcare are important in obtaining a greater than expected proportion of Labrador retrievers living well beyond that of the expected breed lifespan: 89. 7  % (95  % CI 74. 8 - 96. 7  %) dogs were alive at 12  years of age and 28. 2  % (95  % CI 15. 6 - 45. 1  %) reaching an exceptional lifespan of ≥ 15. 6  years...|$|E
