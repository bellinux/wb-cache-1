Under the Montreal Convention, it is the carrier's responsibility to prove lack of fault in <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> each passenger's next-of-kin are automatically entitled, regardless of fault, to a payment of approximately US$175,000 from the airline's insurance company—a total of nearly US$40million for the 227 passengers on board.|$|E

5|$|Holby City has {{attracted}} comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within {{the television and}} entertainment industry including Broadcasting Standards Commission director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television licence fee on the programme. The series employs {{a team of researchers}} to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. Holby City has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the British Medical Association denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> emergency nurse at the 2008 Royal College of Nursing conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, two trams were {{involved}} in <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> sent to Firema for reparations.

Problems with the units included excessive noise, excessive amount of time out of order, rust, cracks in the axles, and increased wear to the infrastructure because they weighed too much. All except two of the SL95 trams were temporarily grounded on 29 April 2013 when it was discovered that rust had damaged the joints between the articulated sections on several trams.|$|E

Montfort was {{prevented}} from attending by <b>an</b> <b>accident,</b> <b>and</b> he was represented by Peter de Montfort and others. Henry had already tried once before, in September, {{to appeal to the}} French king. That time Louis had been sympathetic to Henry's cause, but decided in favour of maintaining the provisions. At Amiens Henry argued that his right to appoint his own ministers and officials had been denied him, in violation of the royal prerogative. He also accused his opponents of destroying royal castles and laying waste to royal lands. For his injuries he demanded a compensation of the barons of £300,000 and 200,000 marks. Referring to the papal writ of annulment, Henry asked the French king to free him from observing the provisions forced upon him by the barons.|$|E
