40|$|Located {{in northeastern}} Baltimore City, Clifton Park {{is one of}} the few {{remaining}} vestiges of the 19 th century historic landscape in Baltimore. It has a significant and varied history spanning 200 years, including its recent role as a park in the park system designed by the Olmsted Brothers. Best known as the summer estate of philanthropist Johns Hopkins in the 19 th century, the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. In 2008, the Parks and Recreation Department, with architecture firm Ayers, Saint & Gross and with input from other invested parties, created a Master Plan for Clifton Park that intends to enhance the visitor’s experience of both its historic resources and recreational facilities. While the Master Plan has done an excellent job planning for the architectural and landscape <b>resources,</b> it neglects <b>archaeological</b> <b>resources.</b> This is due to several reasons, namely that Baltimore City Code does not protect <b>archaeological</b> <b>resources,</b> and those involved in the Master Plan had no background in archaeology. The primary objectives of this research are to identify potential <b>archaeological</b> <b>resources</b> located at Clifton Park and make a case for the inclusion of <b>archaeological</b> <b>resources</b> in the Master Plan because they can significantly enhance the plan’s goals...|$|R
