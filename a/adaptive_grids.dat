INTRODUCTORY REVIEW The use of <b>adaptive</b> <b>grids</b> is very common in solving ordinary or partial differential equations which exhibit frontal or boundary layer types of behavior. The motivation behind using <b>adaptive</b> <b>grids</b> is to improve the accuracy of solutions at an optimal computational cost by concentrating grid points in appropriate areas. There are many methods which have been developed to generate such <b>adaptive</b> <b>grids</b> [1, 2, 3] in one and two dimensions. In this paper we briefly describe a new method of generating such <b>adaptive</b> <b>grids</b> in one dimension (see also [4]). This method is based on approximating the grid spacing ratio as a continuous variable and using this as the prime generator of these <b>adaptive</b> <b>grids.</b> This method ensures that the grid spacing ratio is a smooth function and provides very high resolution. Oscillations in the grid spacing ratio are not desirable as these may cause serious problems in obtaining accurate solutions of partial differential equations numerically.

40|$|Richards' equation, which models {{the flow}} of liquid through {{unsaturated}} porous media, is highly nonlinear and difficult to solve. Step gradients in the field variables {{require the use of}} fine grids and small time step sizes. The numerical instabilities caused by the nonlinearities often require the use of iterative methods such as Picard or Newton interation. These difficulties result in large CPU requirements in solving Richards equation. With this in mind, adaptive and multigrid methods are investigated for use with nonlinear equations such as Richards' equation. Attention is focused on one-dimensional transient problems. To investigate the use of multigrid and <b>adaptive</b> <b>grid</b> methods, a series of problems are studied. First, a multigrid program is developed and used to solve an ordinary differential equation, demonstrating the efficiency with which low and high frequency errors are smoothed out. The multigrid algorithm and an <b>adaptive</b> <b>grid</b> algorithm is used to solve one-dimensional transient partial differential equations, such as the diffusive and convective-diffusion equations. The performance of these programs are compared to that of the Gauss-Seidel and tridiagonal methods. The adaptive and multigrid schemes outperformed the Gauss-Seidel algorithm, but were not as fast as the tridiagonal method. The <b>adaptive</b> <b>grid</b> scheme solved the problems slightly faster than the multigrid method. To solve nonlinear problems, Picard iterations are introduced into the <b>adaptive</b> <b>grid</b> and tridiagonal methods. Burgers' equation is used as a test problem for the two algorithms. Both methods obtain solutions of comparable accuracy for similar time increments. For the Burgers' equation, the <b>adaptive</b> <b>grid</b> method finds the solution approximately three times faster than the tridiagonal method. Finally, both schemes are used to solve the water content formulation of the Richards' equation. For this problem, the <b>adaptive</b> <b>grid</b> method obtains a more accurate solution in fewer work units and less computation time than required by the tridiagonal method. The performance of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>grid</b> method tends to degrade as the solution process proceeds in time, but still remains faster than the tridiagonal scheme...|$|R
