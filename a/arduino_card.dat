40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the use of}} a wireless communication technology through the ZigBee protocol, by implementing XBee S 2 B. Wireless communication was implemented on a wind turbine prototype (i. e. wind power generation) in order to controlling variables automatically, such as: Direction of the wind, temperature, humidity and velocity engine. The XBee were conditioned using a Mega ADK <b>Arduino</b> <b>card,</b> which the signals generated were acquired by several sensors and subsequently sent wirelessly. The programming and monitoring of Arduino module with each of the variables was performed through Labview software. The study was also conducted in order to explore new technologies for wireless communication, which is useful in interoperable systems to monitor, control and automate different processes. As a result, the performance test with the wireless system was stable and data transmission was reliable. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Allergen Mixing Assistant (AMA) by Xtract Solutions is {{a device}} {{designed}} to more “effectively refrigerate, organize, and mix allergenic extracts”. Although Xtract Solutions intended {{the product to}} be fully automated, the company has decided against its automation and declared its current design as a minimum viable product whose components are too expensive, difficult to source and complex. Therefore, Cal Poly AMA design team - Mitchell Parks and Minwoo Suh - has decided to replace these expensive components with much more economical alternatives as shown below: Stirling cooler → Thermoelectric (Peltier) cooler Custom <b>Arduino</b> Controller <b>Card</b> → TEC Thermostat *** Original Housing with Wasted Space * → New Housing ** The cost analysis of the new design quotes the Allergen Mixing Assistant at $ 730, albeit minus the labor cost and manufacturing time, much more economical than the previous design where the Stirling Cooler alone was quoted at $ 830. Beyond its cost-effectiveness, the new Allergen Mixing Assistant has been improved from its previous design in following categories: 1, more effective cooling; and 2, better packaging - its overall physical dimensions have been reduced. Testing proved that a larger focus on heat rejection is needed to maintain the desired set temperature. Due to insufficient heat dissipation our new unit is unable to run for extended periods of time, but will be a viable option if a larger heat sink can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Utilization {{of shape}} memory alloys is rapidly {{spreading}} to many technological areas. From this point, alloys with shape memory {{are used in}} various fields such as temperature sensors in electronics, test valves in medicine, radiator fans in automotive and multi leg mobile robots. Application of nitinol fibers, which are actually shape memory alloys, as muscle fibers in industrial robots are increasing day by day. In this study, several tests were carried on aiming for the operational performance of nitinol fibers {{that are easy to}} control, economic, silent and harmless to environment and that have increasing utilization in recent motion technology. By using embedded systems, contraction (spasm) ratios and electrical current passing through the fibers were measured after 0. 04 and 0. 06 inch nitinol fibers were subjected to various voltages. Additionally, yielding limit value of nitinol fibers at split (breaking) point were detected. In the realized test system, ATmega 2560 microprocessor was took part as an embedded system in the Open Source <b>Arduino</b> Mega electronic <b>card...</b>|$|R
40|$|Low {{power hub}} motors {{are widely used}} in {{electromechanical}} systems such as electrical bicycles and solar vehicles due to their robustness and compact structure. Such systems driven by hub motors (in wheel motors) encounter previously defined and undefined faults under operation. It may inevitably lead to the interruption of the electromechanical system operation; hence, economic losses take place at certain times. Therefore, {{in order to maintain}} system operation sustainability, the motor should be precisely monitored and the faults are diagnosed considering various significant motor parameters. In this study, the artificial feedforward backpropagation neural network approach is proposed to real-time monitor and diagnose the faults of the hub motor by measuring seven main system parameters. So as to construct a necessary model, we trained the model, using a data set consisting of 4160 samples where each has 7 parameters, by the MATLAB environment until the best model is obtained. The results are encouraging and meaningful for the specific motor and the developed model may be applicable to other types of hub motors. The prosperous model of the whole system was embedded into <b>Arduino</b> Due microcontroller <b>card</b> and the mobile real-time monitoring and fault diagnosis system prototype for hub motor was designed and manufactured...|$|R
40|$|The short {{review of}} {{microcontrollers}} of family Arduino, their characteristics and application fields is given. Importance of record of parameters of researched object is marked to produce debugging of control systems on microcontrollers Arduino. Unique possibility of registration of parameters in family Arduino is record on SD a card in an alpha mode with usage of functions  print (),  write (). The problems connected to {{record of the}} binary data on SD a <b>card</b> on microcontroller <b>Arduino</b> Due are considered. The analysis of methods of record of the binary data on SD <b>card</b> <b>Arduino</b> Due, originating problems with neo-cleaning of memory from the previous program leading to possibility of duplication of the data on SD to a card, presence of the erratic {{point of view about}} restriction of volumes of data record and necessity of usage become outdated SD cards is carried out. Ways of elimination of the marked lacks are considered. The estimation of high-speed performance of various approaches of a data recording on SD a card is led. On the basis of the led researches the approach of multiplexing of the writeable information at the expense of conversion of the binary data is offered is byte-serial in a character array in code ASCI without magnification of their volume and record by units on 240 byte. It allows to use as much as possible standard function possibilities write () Arduino and specificity of the organization of memory SD of cards and to increase high-speed performance more than in 1100 times in comparison with record in a character type on one byte. It is marked that usage of decisions of an exception of duplication of the data offered at forums does not provide completeness of their elimination. For Arduino Due for storage cleaning it is necessary usages of the special programmator or setting of the new program of loading. </p...|$|R
