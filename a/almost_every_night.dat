500|$|Kirchherr, Klaus Voormann, and Jürgen Vollmer were early {{fans of the}} Beatles {{after they}} heard the group play in the Kaiserkeller. Kirchherr, Voormann's girlfriend, was {{initially}} horrified {{at the idea of}} spending any time in such a sordid district, but Voormann, after watching the Beatles several times without her, eventually persuaded her to come too. After having previously only listened to Trad jazz, the Platters, and Nat King Cole, the Rock n' Roll that the Beatles played was totally new to them. The three friends visited the Kaiserkeller <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>night,</b> arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr, then 22 years old, later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes.

Voormann became Astrid's boyfriend, and moved into the Kirchherr home, where {{he had his own}} room. In 1960, after Kirchherr and Vollmer had had an argument with Voormann, he wandered down the Reeperbahn (in the St. Pauli district of Hamburg) and heard music coming from the Kaiserkeller club. Voormann walked in and watched a performance by a group called the Beatles: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Sutcliffe and Best, their drummer at the time. Voormann asked Kirchherr and Vollmer to listen to this new music, and after being persuaded to visit the Kaiserkeller (which was in the rough area of the Reeperbahn), Kirchherr decided that all she {{wanted to do was to}} be as close to the Beatles as she could. The trio of friends had never heard this new music called Rock n' Roll before, having previously listened to only Trad jazz, with some Nat King Cole and The Platters mixed in. The trio then visited the Kaiserkeller <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>night,</b> arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage.

After hailing the junk and receiving automatic weapons fire in reply, the cutter returned fire and killed several Viet Cong. They continued to fire on Point White so the skipper ordered the helmsman to ram the junk amidships at full speed. All but four of the crew of the junk were killed. One of the survivors {{turned out to be a}} key leader in the Viet Cong Rung Sat infrastructure. On 15 March [...] engaged and damaged another junk, but shallow water allowed the junk to escape. On 22 March [...] drew fire from another junk on the river. In the battle that followed, an estimated ten Viet Cong were killed. In conjunction with a joint U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps operation designated Operation Jackstay, several Division 13 cutters were ordered to patrol the lower portion of the Soi Rap River in an effort to deny food, water, and ammunition to the Viet Cong operating in the Rung Sat Special Zone. From the start of patrols on 10 March until the ships of the amphibious ready group put the Marines ashore on the Long Thành peninsula on 26 March, Division 13 cutters had taken fire from the shore <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>night</b> during patrol operations. Some of the most intense combat operations that Squadron One encountered occurred during the month of March 1966 in support of Operation Jackstay. The joint operation ended 6 April with the withdrawal of the Marine Amphibious Force but the skipper of Point Partridge decided to continue the patrols after the operation ended. On the night patrols from 1 to 6 May Point Partridge engaged Viet Cong junks or received fire from the shore every night.|$|E

We observed them on <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> clear <b>night</b> during the summer of 2010. We then compared the data for this summer with that of the previous two years. We determined tentative periods for roughly half of these, and they ranged from approximately 40 to 200 days. The brightness changes ranged from 10 to 40 % and the objects in general were redder and cooler when fainter. The variation in brightness is due to pulsation of the stars...|$|R

2500|$|The {{ranks of}} the 36th Arkansas now began to {{deteriorate}} rapidly as soldiers began to desert <b>almost</b> <b>every</b> <b>night</b> as the regiment moved back into camp to defend the state capital. Of the 150 soldiers that the 36th Arkansas' muster rolls report as deserters, {{the vast majority of}} these men left the ranks during the weeks that followed their failed assault at Helena. The regiment began to experience a great amount of general unrest which was demonstrated by increasing desertions and poor morale as the summer continued. On 19 August 1863 Captain Hamilton B. Wear, Company I, 36th Arkansas Infantry, was charged and court-martialed for [...] "encouraging desertion" [...] amongst the soldiers. Captain Wear was court-martialed on August 19, 1863, at Camp Bayou Meto. As late as November 20, 1863, Captain Wear was in the guard-house at Camp Bragg, awaiting a review of his court-martial. He was eventually permitted to resign his commission on December 29, 1863. He took the oath of allegiance to the United States on January 18, 1864. With the high number of total losses to the regiment that summer, totaling 233 from 4 July through September 30, 1863, the regiment went through a large internal reorganization. Companies F and I were disbanded completely, Company H was consolidated into Company A, G with B, C with K and D with E. The regiment now consisted of four companies, A through D, and its strength now stood at 710 officers and soldiers as the desertion rate slowed significantly.|$|E

The astounding popularity of Space Invaders stemmed from players returning to beat the current high score, as players could now compete with each other over who had the highest score. In 1979, Space Invaders Part II and Star Fire took this concept a step further by allowing players to enter initials next to their score. Since this data was stored in the machine's random access memory (RAM), it was deleted every time the machine lost power, which in practice would <b>almost</b> invariably happen <b>every</b> <b>night</b> as operators preferred to leave the machines unplugged when the arcade was closed to avoid incurring unnecessary power costs.|$|R
