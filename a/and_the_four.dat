5|$|Caspian {{invites the}} Telmarines {{to remain in}} Narnia if they will coexist peacefully with the Narnians; but if they wish, they can return to the human world from which they {{originally}} came to Narnia. Some, including General Glozelle, agree to do so, and Aslan creates a portal for them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> Pevensies.

5|$|During the Nara period, from 710 to 794, the {{government}} established and supported workshops called zōbussho, {{the most prominent}} of which was located in the capital Nara at Tōdai-ji, which produced Buddhist statuary. Clay, lacquer and wood, in addition to bronze, were used. Stylistically, the sculptures were influenced by the high Tang style, showing fuller body modelling, more natural drapery and a greater sense of movement. Representative examples of Nara period sculpture include the Great Buddha <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> Heavenly Kings at Tōdai-ji, or the Eight Legions at Kōfuku-ji.|$|E

After his single over, Meckiff's participation in the match was limited to his fielding, during which he caught Goddard from the bowling of Benaud in the South African first innings.
