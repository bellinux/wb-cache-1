50|$|Air fresheners are {{consumer}} products used in homes, or commercial products used in restrooms, that typically emit fragrance. There {{are many different}} methods and brands of air freshener. Some of {{the different types of}} air fresheners include sprays, candles, oils, gels, beads, and plug-ins. There are also solid and passive versions, which use ceramic material and water based ingredients - these combine and create a 'multi-phasing' effect which provides a constantly evolving fragrance. Some air fresheners have been known to have chemicals that provoke allergy and asthma symptoms raising argument about how safe it is to use. However, some air fresheners are VOC exempt, such as a passive, multi-phasing air freshener, that reduces the effects. <b>Air</b> <b>freshening</b> is not only limited to modern day sprays, <b>air</b> <b>freshening</b> also can involve the use of organic and everyday house hold items. Although air freshener is primarily used for odor elimination some people simply use air freshener for the pleasant odors they emit.|$|E

40|$|Background: Household {{cleaning}} products {{are associated with}} adverse respiratory health outcomes, but the cardiovascular health effects are largely unknown. Objective: We determined if long-term use of household sprays and scented products at home was associated with reduced heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of autonomic cardiac dysfunction. Methods: We recorded 24 -hr electrocardiograms in a cross-sectional survey of 581 Swiss adults, 1, 1 - 3, or 4 - 7 days/week, unexposed (reference) ] of using cleaning sprays, <b>air</b> <b>freshening</b> sprays, and scented products. Results: Decreases in 24 -hr SDNN and TP were observed with frequent use of all product types, but the strongest reductions were associated with <b>air</b> <b>freshening</b> sprays. Compared with unexposed participants, we found that using <b>air</b> <b>freshening</b> sprays 4 - 7 days/week was associated with 11 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) : - 20 %, - 2 %] and 29 % (95 % CI: - 46 %, - 8 %) decreases in 24 -hr SDNN and TP, respectively. Inverse associations of 24 -SDNN and TP with increased use of cleaning sprays, <b>air</b> <b>freshening</b> sprays, and scented products were observed mainly in participants with obstructive lung disease (p > 0. 05 for interactions). Conclusions: In predominantly older adult women, long-term frequent use of household spray and scented products was associated with reduced HRV, which suggests {{an increased risk of}} cardiovascular health hazards.

60|$|Instead of {{re-entering}} the house, they strayed {{through the}} garden, the ladies walking {{one on each}} side of Mr. Hall. It was a breezy sunny day; the <b>air</b> <b>freshened</b> the girls' cheeks and gracefully dishevelled their ringlets. Both of them looked pretty--one gay. Mr. Hall spoke oftenest to his brilliant companion, looked most frequently at the quiet one. Miss Keeldar gathered handfuls of the profusely blooming flowers whose perfume filled the enclosure. She gave some to Caroline, telling her to choose a nosegay for Mr. Hall; and with her lap filled with delicate and splendid blossoms, Caroline sat down on the steps of a summer-house. The vicar stood near her, leaning on his cane.|$|R
60|$|The cold {{morning air}} seems to shrivel him, and he crouches {{into a little}} gelid ball on the seat beside the driver, while we wind along the Po on the smooth gray road; while the {{twilight}} lifts slowly from the distances of field and vineyard; while the black boats of the Po, with their gaunt white sails, show spectrally through the mists; while {{the trees and the}} bushes break into innumerable voice, and the birds are glad of another day in Italy; while the peasant drives his mellow-eyed, dun oxen afield; while his wife comes in her scarlet bodice to the door, and the children's faces peer out from behind her skirts; while the <b>air</b> <b>freshens,</b> the east flushes, and the great miracle is wrought anew.|$|R
60|$|The second {{morning there}} was rain, and the <b>air</b> <b>freshened,</b> but the leaden sea lay level as before. The sun {{shone in the}} afternoon; with the sunset the fog came thick and white; the ship lowed dismally through the night; from the dense folds of the mist {{answering}} noises called back to her. Just before dark two men in a dory shouted up to her close under her bows, and then melted out of sight; when the dark fell the lights of fishing-schooners were seen, and their bells pealed; once loud cries from a vessel near at hand made themselves heard. Some people in the dining-saloon sang hymns; the smoking-room was dense with cigar fumes, and the card-players dealt their hands in an atmosphere emulous of the fog without.|$|R

The <b>air</b> had been <b>freshened</b> by the dew, and the breeze, which dried the grasses, roused one to a sense of human necessities and the knowledge that there was a day's work to be done.

60|$|Wonderful as {{all this}} may seem, all learned men {{know that it}} is true. And this one thing at least it ought to teach us, what a {{wonderful}} and Almighty God we have to deal with, whose hand made all these things--and what a loving and merciful God, who makes not only the wind and the sea, and the thunder and the fire kingdoms obey Him, but makes their violence bring blessings to mankind. The fire kingdom heaves up dry land for men to dwell on--the thunder brings mellow rains--the winds sweep the <b>air</b> clean, and <b>freshen</b> all our breath--and feed the plants with rich air drawn from far forests in America, and from the wild raging seas--the sea sends up its continual treasures of rain--everywhere are harmony and fitness, beauty and use in all God's works. He has made nothing in vain. All His works praise Him, and surely, also, His saints should give thanks to Him! Oh! my friends--every thunder shower--every fresh south-west breeze, is a miracle of God's mercy, if we could but see thoroughly into it.|$|R
50|$|Smoke sauna (Finnish savusauna, Estonian suitsusaun, Võro savvusann) {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} forms of the sauna. It is simply a room containing a pile of rocks, but without a chimney. A fire is lit directly under the rocks and after a while the fire is extinguished. The heat retained in the rocks, and the earlier fire, becomes the main source for heating the sauna. Following this process, the ashes and embers are removed from the hearth, the benches and floor are cleaned, and the room is allowed to <b>air</b> out and <b>freshen</b> for a period of time. The smoke deposits a layer of soot on every surface, so if the benches and back-rests can be removed while the fire is alight the amount of cleaning necessary is reduced. Depending on size of the stove and the airing time, the temperature may be low, about , while the humidity is relatively high. The tradition almost died out, but was revived by enthusiasts in the 1980s. These are still used in present-day Finland by some enthusiasts, but usually only on special occasions such as Christmas, New Year's, Easter, and juhannus (Midsummer).|$|R
60|$|At {{that early}} hour {{there were not}} many people astir on the wide avenue down which our friends strolled {{when they left the}} station; but in the aspect of those they saw there was {{something}} that told of a greater heat than they had yet known in Boston, and they were sensible of having reached a more southern latitude. The <b>air,</b> though <b>freshened</b> by the over-night's storm, still wanted the briskness and sparkle and pungency of the Boston air, which is as delicious in summer as it is terrible in winter; and the faces that showed themselves were sodden from the yesterday's heat and perspiration. A corner-grocer, seated in a sort of fierce despondency upon a keg near his shop door, had lightly equipped himself for the struggle of the day in the battered armor of the day before, and in a pair of roomy pantaloons, and a baggy shirt of neutral tint--perhaps he had made a vow not to change it whilst the siege of the hot weather lasted,--now confronted the advancing sunlight, before which the long shadows of the buildings were slowly retiring. A marketing mother of a family paused at a provision-store, and looking weakly in at the white-aproned butcher among his meats and flies, passes without an effort to purchase. Hurried and wearied shop-girls tripped by in the draperies that betrayed their sad necessity to be both fine and shabby; from a boarding-house door issued briskly one of those cool young New Yorkers whom no circumstances can oppress: breezy-coated, white-livened, clean, with a good cigar in the mouth, a light cane caught upon the elbow of one of the arms holding up the paper from which the morning's news is snatched, whilst the person sways lightly with the walk; in the street-cars that slowly tinkled up and down were rows of people with baskets between their legs and papers before their faces; and all showed by some peculiarity of air or dress the excess of heat which they had already borne, and to which they seemed to look forward, and gave by the scantiness of their number a vivid impression of the uncounted thousands within doors prolonging, before the day's terror began, the oblivion of sleep.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have called}} it a stale {{expedient}} on Bernard Longueville's part to [...] "go to Europe" [...] again, like the most commonplace American; and it is certain that, as our young man stood and looked {{out of the window}} of his inn at Havre, an hour after his arrival at that sea-port, his adventure did not strike him as having any great freshness. He had no plans nor intentions; he had not even any very definite desires. He had felt the impulse to come back to Europe, and he had obeyed it; but now that he had arrived, his impulse seemed to have little more to say to him. He perceived it, indeed--mentally--in the attitude of a small street-boy playing upon his nose with that vulgar gesture which is supposed to represent the elation of successful fraud. There was a large blank wall before his window, painted a dirty yellow and much discolored by the weather; a broad patch of summer sunlight rested upon it and brought out the full vulgarity of its complexion. Bernard stared a while at this blank wall, which struck him in some degree as a symbol of his own present moral prospect. Then suddenly he turned away, with the declaration that, whatever truth there might be in symbolism, he, at any rate, had not come to Europe to spend the precious remnant of his youth in a malodorous Norman sea-port. The weather was very hot, and neither the hotel nor the town at large appeared to form an attractive sejour for persons of an irritable nostril. To go to Paris, however, was hardly more attractive than to remain at Havre, for Bernard had a lively vision of the heated bitumen and the glaring frontages of the French capital. But if a Norman town was close and dull, the Norman country was notoriously fresh and entertaining, and the next morning Bernard got into a caleche, with his luggage, and bade its proprietor drive him along the coast. Once he had begun to rumble through this charming landscape, he was in much better humor with his situation; the <b>air</b> was <b>freshened</b> by a breeze from the sea; the blooming country, without walls or fences, lay open to the traveller's eye; the grain-fields and copses were shimmering in the summer wind; the pink-faced cottages peeped through the ripening orchard-boughs, and the gray towers of the old churches were silvered by the morning-light of France.|$|R
6000|$|When Arthur {{went up to}} his dressing-room {{again after}} luncheon, it was {{inevitable}} that the debate he had had with himself there earlier in the day should flash across his mind; but it was impossible for him now to dwell on the remembrance--impossible to recall the feelings and reflections which had been decisive with him then, any more than to recall the peculiar scent of the <b>air</b> that had <b>freshened</b> him when he first opened his window. The desire to see Hetty had rushed back like an ill-stemmed current; he was amazed himself at the force with which this trivial fancy seemed to grasp him: he was even rather tremulous as he brushed his hair--pooh! it was riding in that break-neck way. It was because he had made a serious affair of an idle matter, by thinking of {{it as if it were}} of any consequence. He would amuse himself by seeing Hetty to-day, and get rid of the whole thing from his mind. It was all Irwine's fault. [...] "If Irwine had said nothing, I shouldn't have thought half so much of Hetty as of Meg's lameness." [...] However, it was just the sort of day for lolling in the Hermitage, and he would go and finish Dr. Moore's Zeluco there before dinner. The Hermitage stood in Fir-tree Grove--the way Hetty was sure to come in walking from the Hall Farm. So nothing could be simpler and more natural: meeting Hetty was a mere circumstance of his walk, not its object.|$|R
6000|$|It {{would be}} as much, however, as she {{should be able to}} make it. [...] "To have one hour alone with you." [...] It had rained heavily in the night, and though the {{pavements}} were now dry, thanks to a cleansing breeze, the August morning, with its hovering, thick-drifting clouds and <b>freshened</b> <b>air,</b> was cool and grey. The multitudinous green of the Park had been deepened, and a wholesome smell of irrigation, purging the place of dust and of odours less acceptable, rose from the earth. Charlotte had looked about her, with expression, from the first of their coming in, quite as if for a deep greeting, for general recognition: the day was, even in the heart of London, of a rich, low-browed, weatherwashed English type. It was {{as if it had been}} waiting for her, as if she knew it, placed it, loved it, as if it were in fact a part of what she had come back for. So far as this was the case the impression of course could only be lost on a mere vague Italian; it was one of those for which you had to be, blessedly, an American--as indeed you had to be, blessedly, an American for all sorts of things: so long as you hadn't, blessedly or not, to remain in America. The Prince had, by half-past ten--as also by definite appointment--called in Cadogan Place for Mrs. Assingham's visitor, and then, after brief delay, the two had walked together up Sloane Street and got straight into the Park from Knightsbridge. The understanding to this end had taken its place, after a couple of days, as inevitably consequent on the appeal made by the girl during those first moments in Mrs. Assingham's drawing-room. It was an appeal the couple of days had done nothing to invalidate--everything, much rather, to place in a light, and as to which, obviously, it wouldn't have fitted that anyone should raise an objection. Who was there, for that matter, to raise one, from the moment Mrs. Assingham, informed and apparently not disapproving, didn't intervene? This the young man had asked himself--with a very sufficient sense of what would have made him ridiculous. He wasn't going to begin--that at least was certain--by showing a fear. Even had fear at first been sharp in him, moreover, it would already, not a little, have dropped; so happy, all round, so propitious, he quite might have called it, had been the effect of this rapid interval.|$|R
