2500|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} welding {{process in which}} the arc is struck beneath a covering layer of granular flux. [...] This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself and, combined {{with the use of a}} continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. [...] Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes since the flux hides the arc and no smoke is produced. [...] The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products. As the arc is not visible, it is typically <b>automated.</b> <b>SAW</b> is only possible in the 1F (flat fillet), 2F (horizontal fillet), and 1G (flat groove) positions.|$|E

40|$|Efficient lumber {{utilization}} at the saw is a {{key issue}} in the woodworking industry because of shrinking supply and increasing raw material prices. In this thesis, the formulation of the cross-cut-first method of cutting defects out of lumber, as a one-dimensional stock cutting problem, is discussed, with the objective to maximize yield. Monte-Carlo simulations were used for generating boards of a given grade, to test and compare alternative solution procedures. A fast heuristic for solving the above problem is introduced to enable a real-time computerized implementation. The heuristic is shown to compare favorably with the algorithmic solution obtained, using Kolesar's knapsack algorithm, in terms of solution time and yield. The system is also capable of automatically assigning cutting priorities to reflect demand and production needs. In addition, the cut-rip defect removal strategy is introduced. The results {{of a set of}} experiments designed to evaluate the heuristic procedure as applied to the cut-off and cut-rip strategies are reviewed, in comparison to the operator's performance. Finally, the implementation issues on an <b>automated</b> cut-off <b>saw</b> are presented...|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{revelations about}} the robocall scandal in February, Martin {{publicly}} accused Racknine of being behind the <b>automated</b> calls that <b>saw</b> voters misdirected to non-existent polling locations during the May 2011 federal election. Racknine filed a defamation lawsuit for $5 million in damages. Martin ended up settling the defamation lawsuit {{against him and}} publicly apologized and stated that RackNine was [...] "merely an innocent intermediary not a participant in electoral fraud".Due to the costs awarded to Racknine, Martin received a loan from the NDP and accepted donations from unions to help fund his defamation suit and pay for the settlement. Documents filed with the federal ethics commissioner showed Martin accepted contributions to a legal defence fund from the Canadian Labour Congress, the United Steelworkers and the Canadian Union of Public Employees, and 14 other unions or locals.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 19th and early 20th Century, the {{production}} of wooden roofing shingles was an extremely dangerous {{process in which the}} shingle weaver hand-fed pieces of raw wood onto an <b>automated</b> <b>saw.</b> Despite the danger of the profession, the industry was a large one throughout Washington and Oregon and by 1893 Washington state alone had 150 mills which converted Western Red Cedar into shingles and shakes for the roofing and siding of American homes.|$|E

40|$|Modifications to a 16 inch STC <b>automated</b> <b>saw</b> included: a {{programmable}} feed system; {{a crystal}} rotating system; and a STC dynatrack blade boring and control system. By controlling the plating operation and by grinding the cutting edge, 16 inch I. D. blades were produced with {{a cutting edge}} thickness of. 22 mm. Crystal rotation mechanism was used to slice 100 mm diameter crystals with a 16 inch blade down to a thickness of. 20 mm. Cutting rates with crystal rotation were generally slower than with standard plunge I. D. slicing techniques. Using programmed feeds and programmed rotation, maximum cutting rates were from 0. 3 to 1. 0 inches per minute...|$|E
40|$|Methods of {{producing}} {{large areas of}} silicon sheets were developed by using inside diameter (I. D.) saws to slice silicon ingots. A 16 inch automated I. D. slicing machine was modified to accept programmable electric feed system, a crystal rotating system and a dyna-track blade monitoring and control system. The saw and accessories were used to slice 75 mm diameter single crystal silicon ingots while rotating them. The <b>automated</b> <b>saw</b> automatically recovered the wafers and loaded them into a cassette. The amount of material lost during slicing was reduced by using smaller blades than ones normally used to slice the wafers. Slicing runs on 100 mm diameter silicon is the next goal...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Design curves {{have been}} {{developed}} from the previous body of work concerning the design of SAW coupled resonator filters. These curves permit the investigation of design parameters versus filter performance relationships. When introduced into a closed loop design system, these design curves form the core capability of a design automation system. Specifications such as center frequency, insertion loss, bandwidth, group delay, and phase characteristics are input parameters into the algorithm set. The numerical algorithms presented in this paper, {{in conjunction with a}} set of design automation algorithms and verification algorithms, combine to form an <b>automated</b> <b>SAW</b> design system that will aid a SAW design engineer in rapid design development. Tradeoffs of accuracy versus execution times are studied. Since a design automation system requires many design iterations to converge to an acceptable solution set, efficient algorithmic approaches are required. The algorithms and programs developed in this paper will be available via the Internet. The algorithms and programs developed in this paper will be available via the Internet at...|$|E
