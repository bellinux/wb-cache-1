25|$|By 1986 {{the contras}} were besieged by charges of corruption, human-rights abuses, and {{military}} ineptitude. A much-vaunted early 1986 offensive never materialized, and Contra forces were largely reduced to isolated acts of terrorism. In October 1987, however, the contras staged a successful attack in southern Nicaragua. Then on 21 December 1987, the FDN launched attacks at La Bonanza, La Siuna, and La Rosita in Zelaya province, resulting in heavy fighting. ARDE Frente Sur attacked at El <b>Almendro</b> {{and along the}} Rama road. These large-scale raids mainly became possible as the contras {{were able to use}} U.S.-provided Redeye missiles against Sandinista Mi-24 helicopter gunships, which had been supplied by the Soviets. Nevertheless, the Contras remained tenuously encamped within Honduras and weren't able to hold Nicaraguan territory.|$|E

The film's cinematography was modeled after silent films, which often used natural light. In 1979, <b>Almendros</b> won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography for Days of Heaven.|$|R

2500|$|Due to union {{regulations}} in North America, <b>Almendros</b> {{was not allowed}} to operate the camera. With Malick, he would plan out and rehearse movements of the camera and the actors. <b>Almendros</b> would stand near the main camera and give instructions to the camera operators. <b>Almendros</b> was gradually losing his sight by the time shooting began. To evaluate his set-ups, [...] "he had one of his assistants take Polaroids of the scene, then examined them through very strong glasses". According to <b>Almendros,</b> Malick wanted [...] "a very visual movie. The story would be told through visuals. Very few people really want to give that priority to image. Usually the director gives priority to the actors and the story, but here the story was told through images".|$|R

2500|$|According to <b>Almendros,</b> the {{production}} was not [...] "rigidly prepared", allowing for improvisation. Daily call sheets {{were not very}} detailed and the schedule changed to suit the weather. This upset some Hollywood crew members not used to working this way. Most of the crew were used to a [...] "glossy style of photography" [...] and felt frustrated because <b>Almendros</b> did not give them much work. On a daily basis, he asked them {{to turn off the}} lights they had prepared for him. Some crew members said that <b>Almendros</b> and Malick did not know what they were doing. The tension led to some of the crew quitting {{the production}}. Malick supported what <b>Almendros</b> was doing and pushed the look of the film further, taking away more lighting aids, and leaving the image bare.|$|R
