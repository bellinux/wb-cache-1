5|$|The central {{discussion}} {{within the}} poem is {{on the nature of}} time and salvation. Eliot emphasises the need of the individual to focus on the present moment <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that there is a universal order. By understanding the nature of time and the order of the universe, mankind is able to recognise God and seek redemption. Many reviewers of Burnt Norton focused on the uniqueness and beauty of the poem. However, others complained that the poem does not reflect Eliot's earlier greatness and that the use of Christian themes harmed the poem.|$|E

My love is my weight, that which gives me solidity, attracts me and exalts me. It transmits to me height and depth, it is the origin of my peace.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear fuel is {{reported}} to have melted and fallen to the lower containment sections of reactors 1, 2 and 3. The melted material is not expected to breach a container (which might cause a massive radiation release). Instead, the melted fuel is thought to have dispersed fairly uniformly across the lower portions of the containers of the three reactors, which would make the resumption of the fission process, to the extent of a recriticality accident, 'most unlikely'; however, it is only during future dismantling of the three damaged reactors that {{it would be possible to}} verify this hypothesis <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what really occurred inside the reactor cores.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after this}} decision, the {{municipal}} authorities of Paris were summoned. They {{were ordered to}} shut the city gates and arm the citizenry to prevent any attempt at a Protestant uprising. The king's Swiss Guard was given the task of killing a list of leading Protestants. It is difficult today to determine the exact chronology of events <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the moment the killing began. It seems probable that a signal was given by ringing bells for matins (between midnight and dawn) at the church of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois, near the Louvre, which was the parish church of the kings of France. The Swiss guards had expelled the Protestant nobles from the Louvre castle and then slaughtered them in the streets.|$|E

The four women soon fell out, vying for control over him; Canto CXIII: alluded to it: [...] "Pride, jealousy and possessiveness / 3 pains of hell." [...] Pound {{was in love with}} Spann, seeing in her his last chance for love and youth. He wrote about her in Canto CXIII: [...] "The long flank, the firm breast / <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> beauty and death and despair / And to think that what has been shall be, / flowing, ever unstill." [...] Dorothy had usually ignored his affairs, but she used her legal power over his royalties to make sure Spann was seen off, sent back to America.|$|E
500|$|Arthur Max {{designed}} the sets {{such as the}} alien world landscape and structures, and the vehicles, including the Prometheus and the Engineer's ship. Digital 3D models and miniature replicas of each set were built to allow the designers to envisage the connections between them <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> where the CGI elements would be inserted. To better blend the practical and the digital, the design team took rock samples from the Iceland location so they could match the graphical textures with the real rocks. To create the Prometheus, Max researched NASA and European Space Agency spacecraft designs, and extended these concepts with his own ideas of how future space vehicles might look. He said that he wanted [...] "to do something that was state-of-the-art, which would represent a flagship spacecraft with every technology required to probe into the deepest corners of the galaxy." ...|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr, Klaus Voormann, and Jürgen Vollmer were early {{fans of the}} Beatles {{after they}} heard the group play in the Kaiserkeller. Kirchherr, Voormann's girlfriend, was {{initially}} horrified {{at the idea of}} spending any time in such a sordid district, but Voormann, after watching the Beatles several times without her, eventually persuaded her to come too. After having previously only listened to Trad jazz, the Platters, and Nat King Cole, the Rock n' Roll that the Beatles played was totally new to them. The three friends visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr, then 22 years old, later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> them." [...] Sutcliffe was fascinated by Kirchherr, and Harry later wrote that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way. Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take his eyes off her when she had first walked into the club, and tried to talk to her during the next break, but she had already left.|$|E

500|$|Kirchherr, Voormann and Vollmer {{were friends}} who had all {{attended}} the Meisterschule, and shared the same ideas about fashion, culture and music. Voormann became Astrid's boyfriend, and moved into the Kirchherr home, where {{he had his own}} room. In 1960, after Kirchherr and Vollmer had had an argument with Voormann, he wandered down the Reeperbahn (in the St. Pauli district of Hamburg) and heard music coming from the Kaiserkeller club. Voormann walked in and watched a performance by a group called the Beatles: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Sutcliffe and Best, their drummer at the time. Voormann asked Kirchherr and Vollmer to listen to this new music, and after being persuaded to visit the Kaiserkeller (which was in the rough area of the Reeperbahn), Kirchherr decided that all she {{wanted to do was to}} be as close to the Beatles as she could. The trio of friends had never heard this new music called Rock n' Roll before, having previously listened to only Trad jazz, with some Nat King Cole and The Platters mixed in. The trio then visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes.

2500|$|The chess endgame with a {{king and}} a pawn versus a king {{is one of}} the most {{important}} and fundamental endgames, [...] other than the basic checkmates [...] It is important to master this endgame, since most other endgames have the potential of reducing to this type of endgame via exchanges of pieces. [...] It is important to be able to tell quickly whether a given position is a win or a draw, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the technique for playing it.

The aim of spiritual quest in the Upanishadic traditions is find the true self within <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> one's soul, a state that it believes leads to blissful state of freedom, moksha.|$|E
