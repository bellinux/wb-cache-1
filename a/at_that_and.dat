25|$|A {{significant}} increase in accuracy (to nearly ~80%) was made by exploiting multiple sequence alignment; knowing the full distribution of amino acids that occur at a position (and in its vicinity, typically ~7 residues on either side) throughout evolution provides a much better picture of the structural tendencies near that position. For illustration, a given protein might have a glycine at a given position, which by itself might suggest a random coil there. However, multiple sequence alignment might reveal that helix-favoring amino acids occur at that position (and nearby positions) in 95% of homologous proteins spanning nearly a billion years of evolution. Moreover, by examining the average hydrophobicity <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> nearby positions, the same alignment might also suggest a pattern of residue solvent accessibility consistent with an α-helix. Taken together, these factors {{would suggest that the}} glycine of the original protein adopts α-helical structure, rather than random coil. Several types of methods are used to combine all the available data to form a 3-state prediction, including neural networks, hidden Markov models and support vector machines. Modern prediction methods also provide a confidence score for their predictions at every position.|$|E

However, most notably, Harvey was nominated for, and won, the 2001 Mercury Music Prize. The awards ceremony was held {{on the same day}} as the 11 September attacks on the United States and Harvey was on tour in Washington, D.C., one of the affected cities, when she won the prize. Reflecting on the win in 2011, she said: [...] "quite naturally I look back <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> only remember the events that were taking place across the world and to win the prize on that day — it didn't have much importance {{in the grand scheme of}} things", noting [...] "it was a very surreal day". The same year, Harvey also topped a readers' poll conducted by Q Magazine of the 100 Greatest Women in Rock Music.|$|E

2500|$|Poulidor's {{original}} nickname was Pouli. It was Émile Besson of {{the daily}} newspaper L'Humanité who first wrote of Poupou.

2500|$|In the 1990s, {{the show}} {{branched}} out into supernatural story lines, which critics immediately panned, {{as it was}} seen as a departure from more realistic storylines for which the show had originally become known. However, these storylines did have the desired effect, making Days of Our Lives the most-watched daytime soap among young and middle-aged women, also becoming one of NBC's five most profitable shows in any time slot.

2500|$|In essence, the {{question}} for the Supreme Court of Victoria was whether they followed their earlier decision in Wollaston's case or whether they adopted {{the approach of the}} High Court in D'Emden v Pedder. In the Supreme Court, the Commissioner was represented by Isaacs , while Deakin and Lyne were represented by Higgins [...] The Full Court, Madden CJ, à Beckett & Hodges JJ, decided to follow their [...] earlier decision in Wollaston's case, holding that [...] "As to the applicability of the United States cases, the opinions of the learned Judges in D'Emden v Pedder which apparently lean towards such applicability are merely dicta, and incomplete dicta <b>at</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> we do not regard them therefore as binding upon us." [...] The Court noted the issue as to the ultimate court of appeal, stating that the Privy Council was [...] "at least a concurrent Court of ultimate appeal with the High Court", and the final ascertainment of the law on the matter would depend on the relation of one Court to the other.|$|E

Colchester manager Geraint Williams said: [...] "It's great news for the club. Chris is a defender with experience and leadership qualities." [...] However, Coyne was unable to help prevent Colchester from being relegated {{at the end of}} the season. Coyne was named Colchester United club captain for the 2008–09 season, but selection for the Australia national team, injuries and a change of management meant that he struggled to hold on to a place in the first team, and {{at the end of the}} season, he met with the club management to resolve his future. He left the club by mutual consent in July 2009, saying, [...] "Unfortunately, after 18 months here, it's time to move on. It was made clear that I wasn't going to play week in, week out and I felt that I had to look <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> address it. Also, there isn't much of a chance for the Australian manager to watch League One football but in Australia, I'm guaranteed to play 27 games in front of him." [...] Coyne scored once for the club, his goal coming in a 4–3 defeat against West Bromwich Albion on 29 March 2008.|$|E

[...] After everyone leaves, Phoebe is joined by her father, Sergeant Meryll, who reports that her brother Leonard has been appointed a Yeoman for his valour in battle. [...] Leonard is on his way from Windsor, where the court sits, and may bring with him a reprieve for the Colonel. [...] Leonard Meryll enters bearing a dispatch for the Lieutenant of the Tower but no reprieve. [...] Sergeant Meryll is eager to save Fairfax, for the Colonel served with him in battle and twice saved Sergeant Meryll's life. [...] He hatches a plan: Leonard will hide away and Fairfax, sprung from his cell, will assume Leonard's guise. [...] Phoebe is charged with getting the key to Fairfax's cell from the lovesick jailer, Wilfred.|$|E
