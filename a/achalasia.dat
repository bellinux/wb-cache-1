5|$|The {{symptomatic}} (determinate) chronic stage {{affects the}} nervous system, digestive system and heart. About two-thirds {{of people with}} chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including dilated cardiomyopathy, which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death. About one-third of patients go on to develop digestive system damage, resulting in dilation of the digestive tract (megacolon and megaesophagus), accompanied by severe weight loss. Swallowing difficulties (secondary <b>achalasia)</b> {{may be the first}} symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. <b>Achalasia</b> {{refers to a}} failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Achalasia</b> {{is a major}} {{exception}} to usual pattern of dysphagia in that swallowing of fluid tends to cause more difficulty than swallowing solids. In <b>achalasia,</b> there is idiopathic destruction of parasympathetic ganglia of the Auerbach's (Myenteric) plexus of the entire esophagus, which results in functional narrowing of the lower esophagus, and peristaltic failure throughout its length.|$|E

25|$|Greyhounds are {{typically}} {{a healthy and}} long-lived breed, and hereditary illness is rare. Some Greyhounds {{have been known to}} develop esophageal <b>achalasia,</b> gastric dilatation volvulus (also known as bloat), and osteosarcoma. If exposed to E. coli, they may develop Alabama rot. Because the Greyhound's lean physique makes it ill-suited to sleeping on hard surfaces, owners of both racing and companion Greyhounds generally provide soft bedding; without bedding, Greyhounds are prone to develop painful skin sores. The average lifespan of a Greyhound is 9 to 11 years.|$|E
2500|$|Pathology {{specimens}} of the esophagus {{in patients with}} nutcracker esophagus show no significant abnormality, unlike patients with <b>achalasia,</b> where destruction of the Auerbach's plexus is seen. [...] The pathophysiology of nutcracker esophagus {{may be related to}} abnormalities in neurotransmitters or other mediators in the distal esophagus. [...] Abnormalities in nitric oxide levels, which have been seen in <b>achalasia,</b> are postulated as the primary abnormality. [...] As GERD is associated with nutcracker esophagus, the alterations in nitric oxide and other released chemicals may be in response to reflux.|$|E
2500|$|However, in {{some unusual}} instances, {{as when the}} hiatal hernia is unusually large, or is of the paraesophageal type, it may cause esophageal {{stricture}} or severe discomfort. About 5% of hiatus hernias are paraesophageal. If symptoms from such a hernia are severe for example if chronic acid reflux threatens to severely injure the esophagus or is causing Barrett's esophagus, surgery is sometimes recommended. However surgery has its own risks including death and disability, so that even for large or paraesophageal hernias, watchful waiting may on balance be safer and cause fewer problems than surgery. Complications from surgical procedures to correct a hiatus hernia may include gas bloat syndrome, dysphagia (trouble swallowing), dumping syndrome, excessive scarring, and rarely, <b>achalasia.</b> [...] Surgical procedures sometimes fail over time, requiring a second surgery to make repairs.|$|E
2500|$|The gold-standard for {{diagnosing}} oropharyngeal dysphagia {{in countries}} of the Commonwealth are via a modified barium swallow study or videofluoroscopic swallow study (fluoroscopy). This is a lateral video (and AP in some cases) [...] X-ray that provides objective information on bolus transport, safest consistency of bolus (different consistencies including honey, nectar, thin, pudding, puree, regular), and possible head positioning and/or maneuvers that may facilitate swallow function depending on each individual's anatomy and physiology. In Zenker's diverticulum, barium meal first fills the pouch, then overflows from top. In <b>achalasia,</b> it shows [...] "bird-beak" [...] tapering of distal esophagus, this is also discirbed as a [...] " [...] rat's tail" [...] appearance. Reflux can be demonstrated in fluorscopy. In strictures, meal is initially arrested above stricture, then gradually trickles down.|$|E
2500|$|Nutcracker esophagus, or {{hypertensive}} peristalsis, is {{a disorder}} {{of the movement}} of the esophagus characterized by contractions in the smooth muscle of the esophagus in a normal sequence but at an excessive amplitude or duration. Nutcracker esophagus is one of several motility disorders of the esophagus, including <b>achalasia</b> and diffuse esophageal spasm. [...] It causes difficulty swallowing, or dysphagia, to both solid and liquid foods, and can cause significant chest pain; it may also be asymptomatic. [...] Nutcracker esophagus can affect people of any age, but is more common in the sixth and seventh decades of life. [...] The diagnosis is made by an esophageal motility study (esophageal manometry), which evaluates the pressure of the esophagus at various points along its length. [...] The term [...] "nutcracker esophagus" [...] comes from the finding of increased pressures during peristalsis, with a diagnosis made when pressures exceed 180 mmHg; this has been likened to the pressure of a mechanical nutcracker. [...] The disorder does not progress, and is not associated with any complications; as a result, treatment of nutcracker esophagus targets control of symptoms only.|$|E
2500|$|Nutcracker {{esophagus}} {{is characterized}} as a motility disorder of the esophagus, meaning that it is caused by abnormal movement, or peristalsis of the esophagus. Patients with motility disorders present with two key symptoms: either with chest pain (typically reported as non-cardiac chest pain as it is esophageal in origin), which is usually found in disorders of spasm, or with dysphagia (difficulty with swallowing). Nutcracker esophagus can present with either of these, but chest pain is the more common presentation. The chest pain is very severe and intense, and mimics cardiac chest pain. It may spread into the arm and back. The symptoms of nutcracker esophagus are intermittent, and may occur with or without food. [...] Rarely, patients can present with a sudden obstruction of the esophagus after eating food (termed a food bolus obstruction, or the 'steakhouse syndrome') requiring urgent treatment. The disorder does not progress to produce worsening symptoms or complications, unlike other motility disorders (such as <b>achalasia)</b> or anatomical abnormalities of the esophagus (such as peptic strictures or esophageal cancer). Many patients with nutcracker esophagus {{do not have any}} symptoms at all, as esophageal manometry studies done on patients without symptoms may show the same motility findings as nutcracker esophagus. Nutcracker esophagus may also be associated with the metabolic syndrome, The incidence of nutcracker esophagus in all patients is uncertain.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Achalasia</b> ( [...] ; [...] + -chalasia [...] "no relaxation") is {{a failure}} of smooth muscle fibers to relax, which can cause a {{sphincter}} to remain closed and fail to open when needed.

50|$|<b>Achalasia</b> is an {{idiopathic}} motility disorder {{characterized by}} failure of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation {{as well as}} loss of peristalsis in the distal esophagus, which is mostly smooth muscle. Both of these features impair {{the ability of the}} esophagus to empty contents into the stomach. Patients usually complain of dysphagia to both solids and liquids. Dysphagia to liquids, in particular, is a characteristic of <b>achalasia.</b> Other symptoms of <b>achalasia</b> include regurgitation, night coughing, chest pain, weight loss, and heartburn. The combination of <b>achalasia,</b> adrenal insufficiency, and alacrima (lack of tear production) in children is known as the triple A (Allgrove) syndrome.
