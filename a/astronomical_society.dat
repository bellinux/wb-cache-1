5|$|In 1963, Gascoigne {{developed}} a device, {{known as an}} optical corrector plate, which allowed wide field photography on the new 40-inch telescope at Siding Spring. Such corrector plates were subsequently used on many telescopes and became known as Gascoigne correctors. During this period he was also active in supporting {{the establishment of a}} national research organisation for astronomers, the <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Society</b> of Australia.
