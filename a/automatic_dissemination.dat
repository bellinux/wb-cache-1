40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{improvements in}} global interconnectivity due to intranets and the Internet {{have led to}} {{an explosion in the}} number and variety of data-intensive applications. More importantly, the large volumes of data available for general access and the rapidity with which these data change make it very difficult for users to track the data that they are interested in. Also, scalability is a central requirement in dissemination systems due to the huge number of users and large amount of information. This is demonstrated by frequent delays and service disruptions when accessing shared networked data sources. To overcome scalability issues, considerable research has been going on to minimize redundant server operations and maximize and prioritize bandwidth utilization while aiming for a reasonable (may not be the best) response time. In this paper, we introduce the idea of BUDDIES, a new protocol for data dissemination that can also be extended to <b>automatic</b> data <b>dissemination</b> and differentiated services...|$|R

40|$|If {{upcoming}} {{traffic information}} were disseminated to drivers {{in a timely}} manner, the excessive cost of traffic collisions and congestion {{as well as the}} number of deaths and injuries could be significantly reduced. In order to forward the upcoming traffic information in a timely manner, wireless communication is a viable alternative. Upcoming traffic information can be forwarded in a vehicular network using Vehicle-to-Vehicle or Vehicle-to-Roadside (V 2 R) and Roadside-to-Vehicle (R 2 V) communications. Existing systems for forwarding upcoming traffic information introduce high delay which is not acceptable for time critical emergency messages. Our goal in this work is to develop an <b>automatic</b> information <b>dissemination</b> framework for vehicular ad hoc network. We also present a comparative study of different short range wireless technologies including Wi-Fi (IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g/n), Bluetooth (IEEE 802. 15. 1), ZigBee (802. 15. 4), and Dedicated Short Range Communication (IEEE 802. 11 p) through on board devices which are suitable for Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs). In order to compare these technologies, we will consider connection set-up time, data transfer rate, transmission range, processing delays, etc. as metrics. First, we will simulate VANET scenarios. Then, we will create a VANET prototype to test technologies in real world scenarios using cars and smartphones with applications. In this paper, we will present the results obtained from both simulations...|$|R
40|$|In the {{increasingly}} complex worlds of battlefield, anti-terrorism, peace-keeping and disaster relief operations {{there is clearly}} a need for rapid, useful, precise and unambiguous exchange of information between military units within a given theater of activity. Orders, requests and reports need to be expressed in formal language sufficiently standardized to be unambiguous, while sufficiently expressive to convey a commander’s intent or to report enemy or civilian activities. This language must also support network-centric communication requirements by facilitating <b>automatic</b> processing and <b>dissemination</b> of information. If military communication can be processed automatically, it can be exchanged not only among forces and their C 2 -systems, but also between commanders, C 2 -systems and simulation systems. Commanders then could directly command simulated forces. Simulation systems thus could be used during operations or exercises, e. g., as decision support systems or in staff exercises. A formal, context-free language based upon the JC 3 IEDM, Battle Management Language (BML) is currently being developed to this end. BML’s grammars for orders and requests are well-developed and have been integrated successfully into several prototype simulation systems. The grammar for reports is mostly complete and is currently under further refinement to adequately represent parameters such a...|$|R

40|$|Resumé A {{comparison}} of national Trade mark with Community Trade mark. The purpose of thesis {{is to provide}} fundamental information about trademarks and their legal regulation. The reason why I decided to write a research about trademarks {{is that they are}} one of the most popular and widely used method of labeling products and services. Indisputable advantage of European union Trade mark is that the registration is not need for national Trade mark. Another advantage of European legislation of Trademarks is <b>automatic</b> and free <b>dissemination</b> of the accession of the new member states. Despite the fact that national trademark law is fully in compliance with European legislation, not all questions are completely identical. In thesis I would like to show influence on the czech national Trade marks after European union accession. I focus on the practice of the The Court of Justice of the European Union which has of capital importance on decision making practice of the Czech Courts. In the thesis I focus on the amendment of European union trade mark through regulation European Parliament and Council (EU) 2015 / 2424. There are some changes in three areas: institutional, produceral and changes in the level of charges. This regulation is step forward in the development of trade marks.

40|$|Introduction Canadians, {{and many}} people around the world, are {{increasingly}} purchasing, and using, electronic devices meant to capture and record the relative levels of a person’s fitness. Unlike past fitness devices, such as pedometers, electronic fitness trackers are designed to display aggregate fitness information automatically on mobile devices and, frequently, on websites developed and controlled by the company that makes the given device. This <b>automatic</b> collection and <b>dissemination</b> of fitness data began with simply monitoring the steps a person had taken in a day. Contemporary consumer fitness wearables collect {{a broad range of}} data. The number of floors, or altitudinal changes, a person climbs a day is measured, levels and deepness of sleep, and heart rate activity are all captured by best-of-class consumer-level fitness trackers. And all of this data is of interest to the wearers of the devices, to companies interested in mining and selling collected fitness data, to insurance companies, to authorities and courts of law, and even potentially to criminals motivated to steal or access data retained by fitness companies. This report explores what information is collected by the companies which develop and sell {{some of the most popular}} wearables in North America. Moreover, it explores whether there are differences between the information that is collected by the devices and what companies say they collect, and what they subsequently provide to consumers when compelled to disclose all the personal information that companies hold about residents of Canada. In short, the project asks: 	Were data which are technically collected noted in companies’ privacy policies and terms of service and, if so, what protections or assurances do individuals have concerning the privacy or security of that data? 	What of that data is classified by the company as ‘personal’ data, which is tested by issuing legally compelling requests for the company to disclose all the personal data held on a requesting individual? 	Does the information received by the individual match what a company asserts is ‘personally identifiable information’ in their terms of service or privacy policies...|$|R

30|$|The {{environmental}} monitoring module benefits from interoperable geospatial Web Services and OpenMI components. Versatile geospatial resources accessed through Web Service interfaces, and numerous environmental models following OpenMI can be plugged in GeoJModelBuilder flexibly. One core function of OpenMI is the ILinkableComponent interface. Components {{can be linked}} using the interface, which captures all information about the link between two linkable components.

The event-driven mechanism enables push-based active {{environmental monitoring}} and <b>automatic</b> <b>dissemination</b> of abnormal events. SOS plays the role of event producer, while SES plays the role of an event processing engine. By means of subscribing for an event, users will get the notification from WNS if abnormal observations occur, they can either choose to access existing observations or task sensor systems by a SPS for new observations.|$|E
40|$|We target {{application}} domains {{where the}} behavior of animals or humans is monitored using wireless sensor network (WSN) devices. The code on these devices is updated frequently, as scientists acquire in-field data and refine their hypotheses. Wireless reprogramming is therefore fundamental to avoid the (expensive) re-collection of the devices. Moreover, the code carried by the monitored individuals often depends on their characteristics, e. g., the behavior or preferred habitat. We propose a selective reprogramming approach that simplifies and automates the process of delivering a code update to a target subset of nodes. Target selection is expressed through constraints injected in the WSN, triggering <b>automatic</b> <b>dissemination</b> of code updates whenever verified. Update dissemination relies on a novel protocol exploiting the social behavior of the monitored in- dividuals. We evaluate our approach through simulation, using real-world animal and human traces. The results shows that our protocol is able to capture the social network structure in a way comparable to existing offline algorithms with global knowledge while allowing runtime adaptation to community structure changes, and that existing dissemination approaches based on gossip generate up to three times more network overhead than our socially-aware dissemination...|$|E
