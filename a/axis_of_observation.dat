40|$|Three-dimensional {{information}} {{is important for}} studying cellular organization and function, and many approaches have been used {{over the years to}} reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of microscopic objects (Gaunt and Gaunt, 1978; Inoue 1986). However, most of them are limited to the analysis of static objects. We have developed a simple and inexpensive method of obtaining three-dimensional information on dynamic processes in living cells. This method, which we have named 'double-focal videomicroscopy', yields images at two different focal planes simultaneously, making it possible to obtain information along the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation.</b> This method is especially useful for studying rapid cell movement, such as sperm motility. Although the focus control is usually used when looking at different focal planes, such images may also be brought into focus by changing the mechanical tube length of the microscope. This principle is applied in the case of double-focal microscopy. By using the microscope with two viewing tubes and by slightly changing their relative mechanical tube lengths, images at two different foca...|$|E
40|$|An old {{problem in}} {{military}} affairs is approached {{here in a}} new way. Many soldiers and students have wondered wich are the essentials of warfare. For this they have paid attention to history. The most famous of them is Clausewitz. He has however restricted his attention to land warfare and mainly to the wars of Frederic the Great and Napoleon. In this book warfare has been studied as far as known till the Second World War. In contrast to other works is our study {{not confined to the}} war on land, at sea or in the air. The military activity in all these spheres are compared. For this a new instrument has been made, 'the axial model', derived from an analysis of an encounter. When one tries to eliminate one's opponent it is firstly necessary to know where he is. So it needs to observe him or the place where he hides. Therefore 'observation' is the first basic element in an encounter. Next, one must be in the right distance and in a good position to take aim at him. This means often moving in his direction. Doing so there is a risk to be seen and hit by the adversary. So {{it is important to be}} mobile. Consequently 'movement' is the second element. To eliminate the opposition it is necessary to destruct the opponent's cover, his tools and mostly himself. Thus 'destruction' is the third element. In an encounter both parties score and have to take hits. The victor is not only the party who hits hart, but who is also able to take hits without qualing. In that way 'taking' is the fourth element. Not only movement but also the other three elements take place by an imaginary line and in a certain direction. These lines and directions are interpreted as an axis of movement, an <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation,</b> an axis of destruction and an axis of taking. So in a phalanx with spears and shields all the four elements are coaxial. On the contrary the axis of destruction of a line of 18 th century sailing ships has its line of destruction perpendicular to its axis of movement. The axis of destruction of a fighter plane is again coaxial with his axis of movement and so on. The military events are not described individually but arranged conform their structures of relationships. By this structural approach a concise survey of a great part of military history is possible. The attention is besides focussed on tactical systems. That is to say on the standardized set of procedures prescribed for engagements. The innovations in the development of tactics are dependent of the level of technology. By means of the structural approach, of the axial model and of the development of technology, resemblances and differences, trends and change of trends in military history are to explain. Moreover the insight of the reader in warfare is improved...|$|E

40|$|Can we {{determine}} a spin parameter {{of a black}} hole by <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> a black hole shadow in an accretion disk? In order to answer this question, we make a qualitative analysis and a quantitative analysis of a shape and a position {{of a black hole}} shadow casted by a rotating black hole on an optically thick accretion disk and its dependence on an angular momentum of a black hole. We consider two types of inner edges, an event horizon and a marginally stable orbit, of accretion disks. We have found black hole shadows with a quite similar size and a shape for largely different black hole spin parameters and a same black hole mass. Thus, it is practically difficult to {{determine a}} spin parameter of a black hole from a size and a shape of a black hole shadow in an accretion disk. On the other hand, a displacement of a black hole shadow from a rotation <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> a black hole is caused by a frame dragging effect in the vicinity of a black hole. The extent of the displacement largely depend on a black hole spin parameter. However, {{it is difficult to determine}} a position <b>of</b> a rotation <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> a black hole observationally. So, we can not practically measure a spin parameter of a black hole from the displacement from a rotation <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> a black hole shadow. We newly introduce a bisector <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> a black hole shadow named a shadow axis. We define this shadow axis as a bisector perpendicular to a line segment of the maximum width of a black hole shadow.

40|$|In {{previous}} papers, a formulation {{was presented}} of cosmic ray daily variations produced from solar anisotropies stationary through a year, {{and also of}} their annual (or seasonal) modulation caused by the annual variation <b>of</b> the rotation <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the Earth relative {{to that of the}} Sun.

The contribution of these anisotropies to the daily variation is different from that of those discussed previously.

40|$|AbstractThe evagination of Drosophila {{imaginal discs}} {{is a classic}} system for {{studying}} tissue level morphogenesis. Evagination involves {{a dramatic change in}} morphology and published data argue that this is mediated by cell shape changes. We have reexamined the evagination of both the leg and wing discs and find that the process involves cell rearrangement and that cell divisions take place during the process. The number of cells across the width of the ptc domain in the wing and the omb domain in the leg decreased as the tissue extended during evagination and we observed cell rearrangement to be common during this period. In addition, almost half of the cells in the region of the leg examined divided between 4 and 8  h after white prepupae formation. Interestingly, these divisions were not typically oriented parallel to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> elongation.

40|$|NGC 5077 is an {{elliptical}} galaxy with a disk of ionized gas along its minor <b>axis.</b> <b>Observations</b> <b>of</b> {{the structure and}} kinematics of this gas disk allow us to investigate both the intrinsic shape and the mass distribution of the underlying galaxy. The rotation <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the gas disk is displaced by 23 -degrees +/- 5 -degrees from the apparent major <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the galaxy, so the gas cannot lie in the equatorial plane of an axisymmetric potential. If the galaxy is triaxial and the gas disk has settled into a principal plane then there are two possible configurations, both with the gas on elliptical orbits. One is an oblate triaxial system with the gas in a plane perpendicular to the longest axis, {{the other is a}} prolate triaxial galaxy with the gas in the plane perpendicular to the shortest axis. Alternatively, the gas may lie in the warped and precessing polar ring around an oblate galaxy - in this case the gas must have been acquired recently, probably less than 10 (9) yr ago. The observed rotation curve of the gas rises slowly, reaching a peak at approximately 10 " from the nucleus. For circular orbits in a spherical potential, this would imply a decrease of M/L toward the center, since the core radius of the light is 1 " or less. For gas on elliptic orbits, however, the precise shape of the observed rotation curve will depend on the viewing angle. If the gas lies in a warped polar ring, material further out may be seen in projection close to the center so that the observed rotation velocity is much less than the true circular speed. For NGC 5077, we construct various triaxial and oblate mass models which have constant M/L and are consistent both with the observed velocity fields of gas and stars and with the central mass-to-light ratio implied by the observed stellar velocity dispersion. Thus the slowly rising rotation curve of the gas in NGC 5077 does not require the presence of dark matter in the inner regions...|$|R
