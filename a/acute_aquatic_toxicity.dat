40|$|Quantitative structure-activity {{relationship}} (QSAR) analysis has been frequently utilized as a computational {{tool for the}} prediction of several eco-toxicological parameters including the <b>acute</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>toxicity.</b> In the present study, we describe a novel integrated strategy to describe the <b>acute</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>toxicity</b> through the combination of both toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic behaviors of chemicals. In particular, a robust classification model (TOXclass) has been derived by combining Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis with three classes of toxicokinetic–like molecular descriptors: the autocorrelation molecular electrostatic potential (autoMEP) vectors, Sterimol topological descriptors and logP(o/w) property values. TOXclass model is able to assign chemicals to different levels of <b>acute</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>toxicity,</b> providing an appropriate answer to the new regulatory requirements. Moreover, we have extended the above mentioned toxicokinetic-like descriptor set with a more toxicodynamic-like descriptors, as for example HOMO and LUMO energies, to generate a valuable SVM classifier (MOAclass) for the prediction of the mode of action (MOA) of toxic chemicals. As preliminary validation of our approach, the toxicokinetic (TOXclass) and the toxicodynamic (MOAclass) models have been applied in series to inspect both aquatic toxicity hazard and mode of action of 296 chemical substances with unknown or uncertain toxicodynamic information to assess the potential ecological risk and the toxic mechanism...|$|E

Halogen Free Flame Retardants (HFFRs) have been suggested as alternatives and are already being marketed, although their potential impact on the environment cannot be properly assessed {{because of a lack of}} information regarding their environmental and ecotoxicological properties. The aim of this study was to determine the aquatic fate and effects of a selection of HFFRs that are currently being applied in polymers as alternatives of hazardous brominated flame retardants. To this end, we have identified the current state of knowledge on PBT properties of a selection of HFFRs and prioritized those for further research. We have developed analytical methods to determine organophosphorus HFFRs in water. Next, we quantified the aerobic biodegradation of organophosphorus HFFRs. Finally, we assessed the <b>acute</b> and chronic <b>aquatic</b> <b>toxicity</b> of HFFRs to Daphnia magna. Several chapters of this thesis showed the dilemma between the need for data extrapolation with its associated uncertainties and the need for more reliable, though expensive and time consuming, experimental verification. With the growing evidence of unwanted adverse side effects of several HFFRs, we have to carefully balance the direct risk reduction of fire spread against the potential global impact of contaminants on the long term.

40|$|Chemical risk {{assessment}} usually applies empirical methods to predict toxicant effects on different species. We propose a more mechanism-oriented approach, and introduce {{a method to}} decompose toxicity data in a contribution from the chemical (potency) and from the exposed species (vulnerability). We use a database for <b>acute</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>toxicity,</b> and focus on some well-defined chemical classes. Potency is strongly related to hydrophobicity and vulnerability differences between species are small for narcotic compounds. Potencies show less relation with hydrophobicity and interspecies differences are larger for organophosphate- and carbamate insecticides. Photosynthesis inhibitors generally act narcotic to animals, but were more potent for algae. Using these potencies and vulnerabilities, acute toxicity values were well predicted by the proposed approach (within a factor of 3 - 6). The proposed approach has potential for predicting toxicity for untested species-compound combinations; however, {{there is a need}} for a better definition of 'mode of action' in ecotoxicology. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This study assessed relative toxic effects to fish Pimephales promelas, and a ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis, and attempted to form relationships between tem. A good agreement between toxic potencies (R 2 = 0. 754) was found for a chemically diverse dataset of 364 compounds, when using toxicity to ciliate as a surrogate for that for fish. This relationship was extended by adding three theoretical structural descriptors of the molecules. The inclusion of these descriptors improved the relationship further (R 2 = 0. 824). The structural features that were found to improve the extrapolation between the toxicity to the two different species were related to the electron distribution of the carbon skeleton of the toxicant, its hydrogen-bonding ability, and its relative nitrogen content. Such a QSAAR approach provides a potential tool to predict the toxicities of chemicals for environmental risk assessment and thus for reducing animal tests. JRC.

The proposed approach basically implies replacing the fish LC 50 toxicity test with a simple acute threshold test and thus reducing the number of fish used and also costs. The fish test would be performed only at one concentration, the lowest between the EC 50 concentrations obtained with previous testing with algae and daphnia. When fish would be more sensitive than algae and daphnia, testing with fish would be continued at lower concentrations (step-down). From step-down test results the LC 50 value can be obtained by applying the binominal method of interpolation. These data can be used together with algal and daphnid data to provide the same Predicted No Effect Concentration values. The <b>acute</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>toxicity</b> data used in this evaluation were extracted from the New Chemicals Database of the European Chemicals Bureau.
