However, it failed to match the success of her previous singles, only reaching the top three in on the Ultratip chart of Belgium (Flanders) and in South Korea, while missing the top ten {{in countries such as}} Canada and United Kingdom. In the United States, the song peaked at 86 on the Billboard Hot 100 prior to its single release, and at number 37 on Pop Songs.

500|$|Lin {{sent his}} résumé and a DVD of {{highlights}} {{of his high}} school basketball career to all of the Ivy League schools; the University of California, Berkeley; and his dream schools, Stanford University and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The Pac-10 schools wanted him to walk-on, rather than be actively recruited or offered a sports scholarship. Harvard and Brown were the only teams that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships. Rex Walters, University of San Francisco men's basketball coach and retired NBA player, said NCAA limits on coaches' recruiting visits had reduced Lin's chances. [...] "Most colleges start recruiting <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first five minutes they see him because he runs really fast, jumps really high, does the quick, easy thing to evaluate," [...] Walters said. Lin added, [...] "I just think in order for someone to understand my game, they have to watch me more than once, because I'm {{not going to do anything}} that's extra flashy or freakishly athletic." ...|$|E

After the game, Rainmen head coach Josep Clarós expressed his unhappiness with the calls made by the referees against his team. Clarós said that rather than protesting to the league, he would [...] "send film to FIBA." [...] He commented on the officiating, [...] "It's ridiculous for a final of a professional league in Canada." [...] An anonymous referee later denounced the league's policy regarding player fines and suspensions.

Ennis led the team in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in, while Roberts' 20 wins in 1950 were the beginning of six consecutive seasons with 20 or more wins for the pitcher.

Roberts said of Seminick,"If you had to pick <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clubhouse who was our leader that year, it would be Andy.
