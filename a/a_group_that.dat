5|$|According to Hesler and Smith's 1979 {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Lactarius, L.torminosus belongs to subgenus Piperites, section Piperites (in which it is the type species), subsection Piperites. Species in this subsection are characterized by having latex that does not turn yellow after exposure to air, and/or that does not stain the cut surface of the mushroom surface yellow. A 2004 phylogenetic analysis of European Lactarius species concluded that L.torminosus falls into <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> includes L.torminosulus, and that these two species {{are closely related to}} <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> includes L.tesquorum, L.scoticus, and L.pubescens.|$|E
