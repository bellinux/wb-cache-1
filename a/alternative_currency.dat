500|$|The {{financial}} operations made in dollars {{were subject to}} a strong currency substitution to pesos, the [...] "pesification". There were disputes over the exchange rate of such substitution, as the current price of the dollar in the open market would force most firms and individual debtor to bankruptcy. The initial policy was to make 1 to 1 substitutions to the operations below 100,000 dollars. Another conflict was the corralito, imposed by De la Rúa, which attempted to stop the bank run by forbidding the withdrawal of money from bank accounts. Duhalde promised in his oath of office speech that [...] "The one who deposited dollars will receive dollars". The minister of economy Jorge Remes Lenicov pointed out {{that that would be}} impossible, as the amount of dollars required was higher than even the foreign-exchange reserves of the Central Bank. Duhalde acknowledged two weeks later that he was mistaken. The bank accounts in dollars would be [...] "pesified" [...] at a 1.4 exchange rate, and the state financed the banks for the different rates with other operations. The taxes of public services were [...] "pesified" [...] and fixed at their current values. Most industries benefited from the [...] "pesification" [...] and the devaluation, as they could now export at higher prices, and the economy started to improve. The jump in the international price of soybean in July 2002 also proved highly beneficial. The devaluation also increased the price of imported products, which allowed import substitution industrialization. As the local prices became cheap in dollars, international tourism to the country was increased. The national state absorbed the debts of the provinces and the bonds used as <b>alternative</b> <b>currency,</b> on the condition that they transferred the power to issue bonds.|$|E

50|$|Greco is more {{concerned}} with the details of current and potential <b>alternative</b> <b>currencies,</b> devoting much of his book to descriptions of current examples and a selection of past ones, their strengths and weaknesses, and theoretical possibilities and recommendations for future systems, several of which are his own proposals.

50|$|A {{number of}} <b>alternative</b> <b>currencies</b> {{exist in the}} United States, {{including}} Phoenix Dollars, Baltimore's BNote, Ithaca Hours, Bitcoin and digital gold currency. Unlike some other <b>alternative</b> <b>currencies,</b> both Liberty Dollars and Phoenix Dollars were denominated by weight and backed by a commodity. Liberty Dollars used gold, silver, platinum, or copper. Other private currencies use different bases, such as tying their value to a specific unit of time; i.e., 1 hour = 1 Time Dollar. Under the most simplistic version of that model, the future value of the currency {{would depend on the}} willingness of people to swap their labor, regardless of the market value of the labor provided. However, systems such as Ithaca Hours have introduced more sophisticated models that allow for variations in market value of labor. Liberty Dollars also differed from other <b>alternative</b> <b>currencies</b> in that they carried a suggested US dollar face value.|$|R

50|$|Barters {{are another}} type of <b>alternative</b> <b>currency.</b> These are {{actually}} exchange systems, which only trade items; thus {{without the use of}} any currency whatsoever.

50|$|It is {{estimated}} that between 60 and 80 per cent of NDF trading is speculative.

50|$|Since the 1830s, barter in {{some western}} market economies has been aided by exchanges that use <b>alternative</b> <b>currencies</b> {{based on the}} labour theory of value, and are {{designed}} to prevent profit taking by intermediators.

50|$|Auroracoin {{was created}} as an <b>alternative</b> <b>currency</b> {{to address the}} {{government}} restrictions on Iceland's króna, in place since 2008, which severely restricts movement of the currency outside of the country.

50|$|The Directive proposes certain {{protection}} measures for credit agreements {{in a foreign}} currency due to the significant risks attached for the consumer.

50|$|Some <b>alternative</b> <b>currencies</b> devalue rapidly (they {{are called}} Schwundgeld); this {{increases}} monetary circulation. The Miracle of Wörgl {{is an event}} that showed the potential of this increased spending through {{the introduction of a}} local currency known as Freigeld. Local currencies also have the benefit that they cannot be spent abroad, and thus the money always keeps circulating locally, benefiting only the local economy.|$|R
50|$|Distinct from {{centrally}} controlled government-issued currencies, private decentralized trust networks support <b>alternative</b> <b>currencies</b> such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Peercoin or Dogecoin, {{as well as}} branded currencies, {{for example}} 'obligation' based stores of value, such as quasi-regulated BarterCard, Loyalty Points (Credit Cards, Airlines) or Game-Credits (MMO games) {{that are based on}} reputation of commercial products, or highly regulated 'asset backed' 'alternative currencies' such as mobile-money schemes like MPESA (called E-Money Issuance).|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, bitcoin has become a {{globally}} successful and much followed project. It {{is a kind of}} decentralized digital currency, which functions based on mathematical-cryptographical principles and is created using a computationally intensive process called mining. Thousands of other <b>alternative</b> crypto <b>currencies</b> exist, which have so far stayed unnoticed by the media, even though they outperform bitcoin in many aspects. The central topic of this paper is the extensive ecosystem of <b>alternative</b> crypto <b>currencies</b> and an analysis of their mining process. The goal is to demonstrate, by means of a practical example, how <b>alternative</b> crypto <b>currencies</b> are mined and also to find out, if it's possible to mine crypto currencies profitably with specific type of a graphic card. To successfully reach this goal I had to first analyse the ecosystem of crypto currencies. Subsequently I compared different crypto currencies to one another and eventually successfully implemented the mining operation and evaluated its results. The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} answer the question of whether and how <b>alternative</b> crypto <b>currencies</b> can be profitably mined. I believe the particular benefit of this work rests not only in the practical demonstration of how <b>alternative</b> crypto <b>currencies</b> are mined but also in the summary description of the crypto currency ecosystem's composition and the factors that influence the price of these crypto currencies. Structurally, this paper is divided in three main parts. The first part is dedicated to the explanation of the term crypto currency, what it comprises and according to which principles it functions. The second part contains an analysis of the ecosystem as well as a comparison of a fixed sample of <b>alternative</b> crypto <b>currencies.</b> The third part is the practical part, during which I undertook a real mining operation...|$|R
