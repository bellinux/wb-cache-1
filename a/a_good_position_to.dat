25|$|The city {{recovered}} from the Great Depression {{much more quickly than}} almost any other city in North America due to increased demand for nickel in the 1930s. Sudbury was the fastest-growing city and one of the wealthiest cities in Canada for most of the decade. Many of the city's social problems in the Great Depression era were not caused by unemployment or poverty, but due to the difficulty in keeping up with all of the new infrastructure demands created by rapid growth — for example, employed mineworkers sometimes ended up living in boarding houses or makeshift shanty towns, because demand for new housing was rising faster than supply. Between 1936 and 1941, the city was ordered into receivership by the Ontario Municipal Board. Another economic slowdown affected the city in 1937, but the city's fortunes rose again with wartime demands during the Second World War. The Frood Mine alone accounted for 40 percent of all the nickel used in Allied artillery production during the war. After the end of the war, Sudbury was in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> supply nickel to the United States government when it decided to stockpile non-Soviet supplies during the Cold War.|$|E

In Belgium he qualified 16th but had to retire because of a gearbox fault. At a wet Monza, he was second fastest in Friday practice and started from 16th on the grid.

25|$|For example, {{suppose that}} a {{container}} ship comes into port in Miami, Florida, United States. The ship, which is Liberian-registered, is wanted as security for various debts incurred by its Master while in Denmark. Made {{aware of the}} ship's presence, a local lawyer moves to impose a lien which involves a form of arrest by means of de novo proceedings in rem. The local Federal district sitting in Admiralty determines that the ship's Master had ostensible authority as an agent to pledge the credit of the ship's owners (who are English). It also determines that neither the ship nor its owners have violated American law in any way, and the local court is not in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> hear witnesses who are all resident in other states. Further, major liability in demurrage to the innocent charterers, forwarders, etc. will be incurred if the ship is detained without just cause, so {{it would not be}} unreasonable for the Federal Court to decline jurisdiction. Whether there is subsequent litigation in another state will depend on the tactics of the creditors. Without a lien over the ship or the ability to obtain some form of control over the assets of the debtor, making a claim for money owing may not be cost-effective. But if there have already been proceedings on the issue of liability before a court of competent jurisdiction in another state so that the action in Miami is purely by way of enforcement, the Miami jurisdiction, whether it be state or federal would be the forum conveniens because the ship is physically within the jurisdiction.|$|E

After losing their next game 96–82 away from home to the Harbour Heat at the North Shore Events Centre, the Sharks took revenge against first-up opponents, Hawke's Bay, to achieve their first ever win. After their first win, they were bought back down to earth as they were thrashed by 44 points by the Wellington Saints. After seven games, Mike Helms replaced Rose as the Sharks' second import. The Sharks left themselves in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> reach {{the playoffs for the}} first time in their first season as they only needed to win two of four away games to end the season.

A loss to the Nelson Giants saw the Sharks needing to beat the lowly Manawatu Jets in their regular season finale. With a 96–88 win over the Jets, the Sharks claimed sixth spot and booked themselves a playoff berth. They went on to lose in their quarter-final match-up to the Nelson Giants, 82–67, ending their inaugural season in the NBL.

This appointment further enraged the aristocracy, and Mouzalon's position became extremely precarious.
