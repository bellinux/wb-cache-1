5|$|As is {{the norm}} with all Lemon Jelly-based {{releases}} and promotional material, the artwork for Lost Horizons was created by bandmember Fred Deakin and his London-based graphic design company <b>Airside.</b> The sleeve features a three-dimensional model landscape of a city and countryside built by <b>Airside</b> member Sam Burford, which Deakin then visualised into a computer-generated image using Maya.|$|E
5|$|Removed from Kemble, and {{reassembled}} {{in early}} 2007 in Liverpool, England. Under restoration {{on the former}} <b>airside</b> apron behind the Crowne Plaza Liverpool John Lennon Airport Hotel, which was the original terminal building of Liverpool Speke Airport.|$|E
5|$|Gritters {{are among}} the winter service {{vehicles}} also used in airports, to keep runways free of ice. However, the salt normally used to clear roads can damage the airframe of aircraft and interferes with the sensitive navigation equipment. As a result, airport gritters spread less dangerous potassium acetate or urea onto the runways instead, as these do not corrode the aircraft or the <b>airside</b> equipment.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the operating lines, the infrastructure for the now defunct lines to the former <b>Airsides</b> B and D still remain, though the shuttle vehicles have been removed.|$|R
50|$|Below {{is a brief}} {{description}} of the four original <b>airsides</b> and the airlines that occupied them throughout the years. The bolded airlines indicate the primary (anchor) tenants for each facility.|$|R
5000|$|Each line {{consists}} of two guideways that carry a three-car train each. The trains simply shuttle {{back and forth between}} the terminal and their respective <b>airsides.</b> Passengers board on an island platform between the two guideways and disembark on outer side platforms.|$|R
5|$|Landside {{facilities}}, or {{the facilities}} located outside the TSA security checkpoint, include check-in, car rental, baggage claim and a taxi hire. The upper-level {{has a small}} cafe and newsstand. The upper-level <b>Airside,</b> or the facilities located inside the TSA security checkpoint, has seven gates (Gates 1–6 and 5A), and a small cafe area. Additionally, the entire terminal has been a free wi-fi hotspot since April 2, 2003, when the service was initiated.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Ramsay Plane Food {{is located}} on the sixth floor of Terminal 5 within Heathrow Airport, London, next to the Wagamama restaurant. It is <b>airside,</b> meaning that only {{passengers}} who are about to go on a flight can access Plane Food. The restaurant cost £2.5 million to set up, and Ramsay signed an initial lease for ten years with the airport. The chef patron of the restaurant is Stuart Giles, who had previously worked at Ramsay's Boxwood Cafe. Since September 2015 Executive Chef is Andrew Winstanley.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Ramsay Plane Food is a {{restaurant}} owned by chef Gordon Ramsay and located within Terminal 5 of Heathrow Airport, London. The restaurant cost £2.5 {{million to build}} and due to its location within the <b>airside</b> area of the airport, there are restrictions {{on the use of}} gas and the types of cutlery which may be used. It opened in 2008 alongside the rest of Terminal 5, and with several other Ramsay-related openings that year. Ramsay said that he aimed to keep the menu lean without the use of heavy sauces, and menus are also offered for quick dining as well as takeaway cool boxes which contain a three course meal to be eaten on a plane.|$|E
50|$|In December 2016 Egyptian Airports Company {{announced}} plans to extend Terminal 2. EAC plans to expand Terminal 2 and increase its capacity by two million passengers per year, thus taking the total capacity of the airport to 9.5 million. This also includes {{the construction of a}} new runway and 40 new <b>airsides.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to a similar landside/airside terminal design used at Orlando International Airport, passengers must first access the APM system before going through the security checkpoints, as the security checkpoints {{are located in the}} <b>airsides</b> (though boarding passes are inspected before boarding the people movers so only ticketed passengers have access to them).|$|R
50|$|Airport conveniences {{that are}} free of charge include {{passenger}} paging, wireless Internet access, cell phone waiting lot with flight information, shuttle service from the economy garage, real-time flight information and travelers aid services. Other services include eateries located before passenger checkpoints, touch screen information kiosks, information about local events and outdoor smoking areas. In June 2012, the airport debuted several distinctly-Tampa restaurants and bars in both the landside terminal and the <b>airsides.</b> Among these eateries now represented at the airport are the iconic Ybor City Columbia Restaurant, downtown's Mise en Place's First Flight wine bar, and Cigar City Brewing's brewpub, which features an on-site produced pale ale named after Tampa aviation pioneer Tony Jannus.|$|R
5|$|The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) {{operates}} an A-Star helicopter at the airport, {{while the}} BC Forest Service occasionally uses the airfield with their helicopters. It maintains an aircraft maintenance centre, while aircraft parts are sold by Inland Communications, Mountainaire Services, Progressive Air Services, Pro Aero Engines, Spring Aviation and Westcan Aircraft Sales & Salvage. Meanwhile, packages {{can be delivered}} through FedEx at the Kamloops Airport, while custom and security services are provided by Canada Border Services Agency and Garda Security Screening. There is a radio navigation aid provided at the Kamloops Airport which is used by pilots on aircraft coming from other nearby airports to determine their location. The navigation system is owned by Nav Canada, which operate an {{air traffic control system}} at it. The <b>Airside</b> Business Park and Fulton Industrial Park are the airport's development areas.|$|E
5|$|The Institution {{is split}} into six {{administrative}} divisions: East (East Anglia and South East England), South (South West England), West (Wales and the Isle of Man), North (East and west coasts of northern England), Scotland and Ireland (Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland). The {{headquarters of the}} RNLI are in Poole, Dorset, adjacent to Holes Bay in Poole Harbour. It includes RNLI HQ, lifeboat maintenance and repair facilities, the Lifeboat Support Centre and RNLI College (the training centre). The support centre and college were opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 2004. Specialist training facilities include a wave and capsize pool, a fire simulator, a ship's bridge simulator and an engineering workshop. The College's accommodation is available for RNLI members and their guests when training is not taking place and offers facilities for weddings, conferences and other events. About half of the RNLI's staff work at Poole. Other locations are Dublin, London, Perth, Saltash, St Asaph and Stockton-on-Tees, while some roles are at lifeboat stations or home-based and include operations, estate and financial management, public relations and information technology. A new headquarters for RNLI Ireland was opened at <b>Airside</b> in Swords, County Dublin in June 2006 by President Mary McAleese, attended by the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the RNLI, Admiral Sir Jock Slater, R.N.|$|E
25|$|There exist two <b>airside</b> {{connectors}} at SFO {{that enable}} passengers to roam (post-security) between adjacent terminal buildings. A short <b>airside</b> connector links T3's Boarding Area F (adjacent to Amex Centurion Lounge) to the International Terminal Boarding Area G. An airy 500-foot <b>airside</b> connector links T1's Boarding Area C to T2.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to works in Jacksonville, KBJ has worked extensively throughout north and central Florida, {{and to a}} lesser degree throughout the southeast United States. Clients include international and private corporations, developers, institutions, public authorities, as well as federal, state, and local governments. The firm also developed the design standards for residential developments at the Deerwood Country Club and at Amelia Island Plantation north of Jacksonville. In Orlando, KBJ designed the First National Bank and Hartford Insurance buildings and three of the four <b>airsides</b> at Orlando International Airport; in Gainesville, the Delta Tau Delta fraternity house and Tigert Hall, the University of Florida Administration building; the Quarterdeck Club in Miami and the Occidental Life building in Raleigh.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} satisfy the {{continually}} growing demand for air transportation, further improvements has been demanded to increase airports’ capacity. Usually, such effort requires significant resources, generating social and environmental concerns. When improving any airport facility, several systemic actions are {{required in order to}} ensure that such effort will actually be able to provide real benefits to the airport (as a whole), instead of just transferring the bottleneck through the system. In the present study, the operational capacities of two <b>airside’s</b> subsystems are presented, showing those metrics for the top twenty Brazilian airports. As a result, only four of them indicate good balance between subsystems capacities, therefore, all the others are showing at least one subsystem that can be characterized as a bottleneck. For those cases, the expansion of the airport capacity is only possible through actions capable to solve capacity problems at the limited subsystem...|$|R
25|$|Transit {{passengers}} remaining <b>airside</b> {{are provided}} with free dedicated transfer buses between terminals.|$|E
25|$|American Airlines has an Admirals Club on the {{mezzanine}} {{level of}} the <b>airside</b> terminal.|$|E
25|$|There are no <b>airside</b> {{connectors}} between: T1 and International Boarding Area A; T2 and T3; International Boarding Areas A and G (the {{main terminal}} {{area of the}} International Terminal separates the two boarding areas). By approximately 2020 to 2022, the demolition and rebuild of the southern portion of T1 (Boarding Area B) will have been completed and an <b>airside</b> connector to International Boarding Area A will be added.|$|E
25|$|<b>Airside</b> transit visa, {{required}} by some countries for passing through their airports even {{without going through}} passport control.|$|E
25|$|At present, inter-terminal {{connection}} is provided on the landside at Gateway@klia2 complex {{and there are}} provisions for future <b>airside</b> inter-terminal connection.|$|E
25|$|Schönefeld Airport {{consists}} of the four terminals A, B, C and D. These terminals are located {{next to each other}} but have separate landside areas; however they are connected through a joint <b>airside</b> concourse. Terminal C has no check-in facilities, it is used exclusively for passengers clearing security checks to enter the <b>airside</b> boarding gates. Due to a lack of space, there are not as many facilities as those at many other international airports. There are some shops, however, including duty-free, newsagents, a few restaurants such as Burger King and a single airline lounge.|$|E
25|$|A new {{official}} website was also released in 2009 following {{the new album}} and tour. The design maintained many aspects used on the previous site made by London-based design company <b>Airside.</b>|$|E
25|$|In late 2007, work {{commenced}} on Skyhub (located {{between the}} Main Terminal and Terminal 2) which created a single, purpose-built security screening area {{in place of}} the previous individual facilities {{for each of the three}} piers, the other side effect being an enlarged duty-free shopping area created by taking most of the previous landside shopping and restaurant facilities <b>airside.</b> This new arrangement also frees up space in the departure lounges through the removal of the separate duty-free shops in the West and Central Piers. This however meant that the former public viewing areas of the apron are now <b>airside,</b> making the airport inaccessible to aviation enthusiasts and spectators.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Airside</b> Terminal at Pittsburgh International, {{which was}} {{designed}} by Tasso Katselas Associates, Inc., became {{a model for other}} airports around the world. Its design simplified aircraft movement on the airfield and enabled easy pedestrian traffic to the gates.|$|E
25|$|A pharmacy, banking options, foreign {{exchange}} facilities, a post office, mobile phone stores, a book store and grocery store are provided. There {{are also a}} number of fashion outlets as well as restaurants, including Halaal-friendly options, available, both on the landside and <b>airside.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{passing through}} the {{security}} checkpoint, passengers board one of two underground people movers that travel to the <b>Airside</b> Terminal, where all departure gates are located. The people mover system was built and operated by Bombardier Transportation and is completely controlled by computer.|$|E
25|$|Access to <b>airside</b> {{portions}} of the airport is controlled and maintained by the airport's team of security officers, regulated by the Department for Transport. Brook House, an immigration-removal centre of Immigration Enforcement, was opened near the airport on 18 March 2009 by the then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} of the plan (Phase I), taking place between 1994 and 1998, {{involved}} the construction a new departures terminal and of a new <b>airside</b> concourse with five jetways and nine gates (referred to as 'the Finger') {{as well as the}} extension of airport ramps and of their associated taxiways.|$|E
25|$|The current {{landside}} terminal will {{be replaced}} in 2023 with an (estimated) $1.1 billion USD landside terminal connected directly to the <b>airside</b> terminal where concourses C & D are. This will eliminate 12 gates from the airport. This {{will result in the}} depreciation of the people mover and the construction of new parking.|$|E
25|$|The Pride Lounge {{features}} a circular layout overlooking the <b>airside</b> runways, {{and provides a}} separate Cigar Room, washrooms and showers, a Kiddy Zone and a dining/ working area. The Simba Lounge hosts a Family Lounge, Business Experience Centre, washrooms and showers, a noise-proof Quiet Zone for sleeping, a dining/working area and a separate smoking zone.|$|E
25|$|The airport has two terminals, South and North. Both have {{shops and}} {{restaurants}} landside and <b>airside,</b> and all areas are accessible to disabled passengers. There are facilities for baby changing and feeding. business travellers have specialised lounges. The North and South Terminals are connected by a 0.75 miles (1.21km), elevated, two-way automated people mover landside. They are not connected once past security.|$|E
25|$|In June 2017, WOW air began year-round {{service to}} Reykjavik, Iceland, while Condor started {{seasonal}} flights to Frankfurt, Germany. The two airlines {{were the first}} from Europe to serve Pittsburgh since British Airways halted their service to London in 1999. Starting September 5, 2017, non-ticketed persons {{will be allowed to}} access the <b>airside</b> terminal and gates, similar to pre 9/11 policy.|$|E
25|$|The 1974 {{terminal}} {{was built}} in the International style of architecture popular for American commercial and institutional buildings from the 1950s through the late 1970s. It consists of a single curved terminal with concourses radiating outward. Large floor to ceiling plate glass windows form curtain walls on the departure level of the terminal with horizontal bands of repetitive white architectural panels above and below. A slight departure from typical International style, the upper band of panels was decorated with raised circles of four sizes, two circles per size per panel. The roof is flat over the terminal and concourses; a series of steel columns painted white with stay cables for the terminal awning project from the roof. An enclosed white-clad Observation Deck jutted out from the <b>airside</b> terminal face at a sharp angle between the old concourses B and C. On the <b>airside</b> of the terminal, a large horizontal white sign with teal lettering identified the city as Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|In November 1980, the Federal Transport Minister, Ralph Hunt, {{announced}} that a new international terminal would be built in Perth {{at a cost of}} A$26million (1980). Design of the new International Terminal commenced in 1982, with one of the key principles of the design being the allowance for easy future expansion as the needs of the airport dictated. The project called {{for the construction of a}} new terminal, apron, <b>airside</b> roads, access roads, car parks and other passenger facilities.|$|E
