40|$|In {{the past}} two decades many {{attempts}} have been made to relate surface and interfacial parameters with the blood compatibility of polymeric surfaces. It is however doubtful if by a single parameter the behaviour of blood on a surface can be predicted. Two major aspects of blood compatibility - the prevention of platelet adhesion and the deactivation of the intrinsic coagulation system are determined by the measure and nature of competitive blood protein adsorption on the foreign surface. The adhesion of blood platelets is promoted by adsorbed fibrinogen and gamma globulin, while adsorbed <b>albumin</b> <b>inhibits</b> platelet adhesion. Heparinised surfaces do not adsorb fibrin and consequently no adhesion of platelets takes place. Other surfaces with low platelet adhesion are the hydrogels, certain block copolyetherurethanes, polyelectrolyte complexes and biolised proteins. Heparinised surfaces of the cationically bonded type inhibit the intrinsic coagulation as well, however this may be due to unstable coatings and heparin leakage.

The technique is currently clinically used {{for the treatment of}} several malignancies. However, the PDI of microorganisms still remains in the research phase. Purpose: To study the effect of human blood plasma and human serum albumin (HSA) on the PDI of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Methods: PDI experiments were performed using white light (30 mW cm(- 2)) and the cationic 5 -phenyl- 10, 1 5, 20 -tris(N-methyl- 4 pyridyl) porphyrin chloride (TriP[4]) as photo sensitizer. Results: The microorganisms could be successfully photoinactivated by TriP[4] when suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In this medium, P. aeruginosa was the most resistant microorganism. Changing the suspending medium from PBS to human blood plasma reduced the PDI of all three microorganisms. In human blood plasma C. albicans was the most resistant microorganism.

Among other diseases, dysfunction of the material occurs in acute respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS). During ARDS, plasma proteins leaked from capillaries inhibit LS surface activity. As models for ARDS, bovine lipid extract surfactant (BLES) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) in monolayer and bilayer dispersions, with and without bovine serum albumin (BSA), were studied. The studies were conducted using Langmuir and adsorption surface balances (monolayer), atomic force microscopy (AFM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Surface balance studies suggested that BSA inhibited surfactant adsorption to the air-water interface to form monolayer films, and such films did not reach low surface tension upon compression. AFM showed the appearance of well-defined gel-like or condensed domains in films of BLES alone, but with BSA added, these domains appeared less defined, more numerous, and other fluid-like new domains were also detected. With DSC, BLES (2 mgs/ml) bilayer dispersions showed a broad gel to liquid crystalline phase transition between 20 - 40 °C, and addition of BSA (12. 5 - 250 wt% of BLES lipids) to BLES (or DPPC) made the transition more diffuse suggesting protein interactions with the bilayer. TEM studies showed elongation of BLES multilamellar vesicles and only minor alterations of such structures {{with the addition of}} BSA. FTIR of similar BLES/BSA dispersions suggested that BSA associated with the head group regions of the phospholipid and also affected the hydrophobic tail regions, as monitored from CH₂, C=O and PO₄⁻ vibrational stretching modes.

40|$|International audienceEvery year, one {{in every}} 30 Americans has a hip {{prosthesis}} implanted, i. e. 250, 000 every year implants in the US market. Health issues with regard to patient mobility, which in turn reflects an aging population, are of increasing concern, but we also see a trend toward younger and younger patients. Younger, first time recipients of hip prostheses are of concern, {{because of the high}} probability that they will be recipients of multiple prostheses replacements over their lifetimes, since some implants have approximate lifetimes of 15 years. The femoral stem, for example, should be made of 316 L/ 316 LN stainless steel, in order to optimize lifetime. Fretting corrosion, friction under small displacements, between stainless steel and bone, for instance, occurs during human gait, due to repeated loadings and un-loadings,. Some experimental investigations of fretting corrosion have been reported. As is well known, metallic alloys and especially stainless steels are covered with a passive film that inhibits corrosion and hence degradation when implanted within the body. This passive layer of few nanometers in thickness at ambient temperature is the key of our reactive metals-based civilization according to some authors. This work is dedicated to predicting the passive layer thicknesses of stainless steel under fretting corrosion conditions, with specific emphasis on the role of proteins. The analysis is based on the Point Defect Model (PDM, micro scale) and an update of the model on the friction process (micro macro scale) to yield the Fretting Model (FM). A genetic algorithm was used to optimize the fretting model on the experimental data, in order to derive values for important model parameters. The major results are, as expected from experimental results, <b>albumin</b> <b>inhibits</b> corrosive degradation of the steel; an incubation time is necessary for degradation of the passive film; under fretting corrosion and {{in the presence of a}} high concentration of chloride ion, passivity of the steel is also inhibited.

40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Long-term {{exposure}} of beta cells to lipids, particularly {{saturated fatty acids}} in vitro, results in cellular dysfunction and apoptosis (lipotoxicity); this could contribute to obesity-related diabetes. Our aims were to relate cell death to intracellular triglyceride concentration, composition and localisation following incubation of INS 1 cells in saturated and unsaturated NEFA in high and low glucose concentrations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Insulin-producing INS 1 cells were cultured (24 h; 3 and 20 mmol/l glucose) with palmitic, oleic or linoleic acids and the resulting intracellular lipids were analysed by gas chromatography and microscopy. Cell death was determined by quantitative microscopy and 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by ELISA. RESULTS: All NEFA (0. 5 mmol/l, 0. 5 % <b>albumin)</b> <b>inhibited</b> glucose-stimulated (20 mmol/l) insulin secretion. Cytotoxicity was evident only with palmitic acid (p 65 degrees C), which could induce endoplasmic reticulum stress proteins and signal apoptosis; lipid-induced apoptosis would therefore be {{a consequence of the}} physicochemical properties of these triglycerides. Since cellular triglycerides composed of single species of fatty acid are not likely to occur in vivo, destruction of beta cells by saturated fatty acids could be predominantly an in vitro scenario...|$|R

Because diabetes may be also complicated by increased susceptibility to recurrent infection, we investigated the effects of AGEs on human neutrophils, because their burst of activity immediately upon engagement of pathogens or other inflammatory triggers is critical to host response. We demonstrate the presence of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) at the message and protein levels. We also demonstrate that AGE albumin (but not control albumin) binds with high affinity to human neutrophils (Kd of 3. 7 � 0. 4 nM). The binding was blocked almost completely by excess soluble RAGE, anti-RAGE antibodies, or antibodies to CML-modified albumin. AGE albumin induced a dose-dependent increase in intracellular-free calcium as well as actin polymerization. Further, AGE <b>albumin</b> <b>inhibited</b> transendothelial migration and Staphylococcus aureus-induced but not fMLP-induced production of reactive oxygen metabolite. Moreover, although AGE albumin enhanced neutrophil phagocytosis of S. aureus, it inhibited bacterial killing.

Mannan or mannosylated <b>albumin</b> <b>inhibited</b> this activated uptake of unopsonized Candida, but glucan did not. Addition of mAb to complement receptor (CR) 3 did not inhibit ingestion; macrophages that lacked CR 3 (leukocyte adhesion defect) showed normal upregulation of ingestion by IFN-gamma. The increased candidacidal activity of IFN-gamma-activated macrophages was associated with reduced expression of MMR by a mean of 79 % and decreased pinocytic uptake of 125 I-mannosylated BSA by 73 %; K(uptake) of pinocytosis was not changed. Exposure of resident macrophages to unopsonized Candida did not elicit a transient increase in intracellular free Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i); macrophages activated by IFN-gamma expressed a brisk increase in [Ca 2 +]i on exposure to Candida. These data suggest that macrophage activation by IFN-gamma can enhance resistance to C. albicans infection in spite of downregulation of the MMR, perhaps through enhanced coupling of the MMR to microbicidal functions...|$|R

Methods : Alkalemic conditions in the recirculation circuit were prepared by adding various concentrations of NaHCO 3 to the priming fluid. Albumin was also added to confirm its inhibitory effect on blood clotting. Blood pH, hold-up, the pressure gradient, and red blood cell (RBC) reduction rate were monitored. Blood clots were examined microscopically. Results : Although blood pH was elevated under all experimental conditions, clotting in the circuit increased with increased concentrations of HCO 3 -. <b>Albumin</b> <b>inhibited</b> the clotting under the same alkalemic conditions.

Measurements of bacterial adhesion on polymer surfaces pre-adsorbed with a variety of proteins demonstrate that Fn leads to increased bacterial adhesion, with the order of effectiveness being Fn 》Fg > albumin. Immuno-AFM (atomic force microscopy) was used to assess the Fn adsorption/activity on surfaces and bacterial cell membranes by looking at molecular scale events. A correlation between molecular scale Fn adsorption and macroscale bacterial adhesion was observed, with an increased numbers of Fn-receptor recognition events measured on cell surfaces as compared to Fg-receptor recognition events, suggesting Fn is an important protein in bacterial adhesion. Monoclonal antibodies recognizing either the carboxyl-terminus or amino-terminus of Fn were coupled to AFM probes and used to assess the orientation of Fn adsorbed on a surface, with an increased amount of Fn carboxyl-terminus availability corresponding to higher bacterial adhesion.

Succinoylation, reduction and alkylation or heat-denaturation had no such effect. In affinity chromatography under physiological conditions, serum was depleted of fibronectin when run through columns of the carbodi-imide-treated proteins coupled to agarose. Fractions eluted from such columns with urea were enriched in fibronectin. The binding of radiolabelled fibronectin to the carbodi-imide-treated proteins was inhibited by unlabelled fibronectin in relatively low concentrations, but also by albumin in higher concentrations. Heat-denatured <b>albumin</b> <b>inhibited</b> at concentrations approx. 10 – 30 times lower than native albumin. The binding reaction had a pH optimum of 6 – 8.

Conclusions Our data indicate that HOCl-modified serum albumin veils the binding site for CD 4 and the V 3 loop on gp 120. Such masking of the viral gp 120 /gp 41 envelope complex might be a simple but promising strategy to inactivate HIV- 1 and therefore prevent infection when HOCl-modified serum albumin is applied, for example, as a topical microbicide. </p...|$|R
40|$|The type {{rather than}} the amount of dietary fat may be more {{important}} in breast carcinogenesis. While animal studies support this view, {{little is known about the}} effects of essential fatty acids (EFAs) at the cellular level. The MCF- 7 breast cancer and the MCF- 10 A non-cancerous human mammary epithelial cell lines are compared in terms of growth response to EFAs and ability to incorporate and process the EFAs. Eicosapentaenoic (EPA, n- 3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, n- 3) acids, presented bound to <b>albumin,</b> <b>inhibited</b> the growth of MCF- 7 cells by as much as 50 % in a dose-dependent manner (6 - 30 microM) in medium containing 0. 5 % serum. alpha-Linolenic (LNA, n- 3) and arachidonic (AA, n- 6) acids inhibited growth less extensively, while linoleic acid (LA, n- 6) had no effect. In contrast, MCF- 10 A cells were not inhibited by any of the EFAs at levels below 24 microM. The differential effects of AA, EPA and DHA on MCF- 7 and MCF- 10 A cells support a protective role of highly unsaturated essential fatty acids against breast cancer. The EFAs were primarily incorporated into phosphoglycerides. MCF- 7 cells showed chain elongations and possibly delta 8 desaturation, but no AA was formed from LA, nor EPA or DHA from LNA. In contrast, MCF- 10 A cells desaturated and elongated the exogenous EFAs via all the known pathways. These findings suggest defects in the desaturating enzymes of MCF- 7 cells. LNA, DHA and AA presented to MCF- 7 cells in phospholipid liposomes inhibited growth as extensively as albumin-bound free acids, but were less extensively incorporated, suggesting different mechanisms of inhibition for the two methods...|$|R
40|$|Human albumin has {{recently}} been demonstrated to protect brain neurons from injury in rat ischemic brain. However, there is no information available about whether human albumin can prevent loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression of dopaminergic (DA) neurons induced by 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) toxicity that is most commonly {{used to create a}} rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, two microliters of 1. 25 % human albumin were stereotaxically injected into the right striatum of rats one day before or 7 days after the 6 -OHDA lesion in the same side. D-Amphetamine-induced rotational asymmetry was measured 7 days, 3 and 10 weeks after 6 -OHDA lesion. We observed that intrastriatal administration of human albumin significantly reduced the degree of rotational asymmetry. The number of TH-immunoreactive neurons present in the substantia nigra was greater in 6 -OHDA lesioned rats following human albumin-treatment than non-human albumin treatment. TH-immunoreactivity in the 6 -OHDA-lesioned striatum was also significantly increased in the human albumin-treated rats. To examine the mechanisms underlying the effects of human albumin, we challenged PC 12 cells with 6 -OHDA as an in vitro model of PD. Incubation with human albumin prevented 6 -OHDA-induced reduction of cell viability in PC 12 cell cultures, as measured by MTT assay. Furthermore, human albumin reduced 6 -OHDA-induced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in cultured PC 12 cells, as assessed by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis showed that human <b>albumin</b> <b>inhibited</b> 6 -OHDA-induced activation of JNK, c-Jun, ERK, and p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling in PC 12 cultures challenged with 6 -OHDA. Human albumin may protect against 6 -OHDA toxicity by influencing MAPK pathway followed by anti-ROS formation and anti-apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|Antibodies of poly-D-alanyl {{specificity}} {{were produced}} in goats, rabbits, {{rats and mice}} by immunization with poly-D-alanyl ribonuclease. The reaction of the sera with formalinized sheep erythrocytes, tanned and coated with poly-D-alanyl human serum <b>albumin,</b> was <b>inhibited</b> with oligopeptides of D-alanine of increasing size. The upper limit {{of the size of}} goat and rabbit antibody combining sites was complementary to a tetrapeptide, in agreement with results obtained by inhibition of precipitin reaction. Since the data obtained with both methods compared favourably, the upper limit size of mouse and rat antibody combining sites of poly-D-alanyl specificity was estimated by the passive haemagglutination-inhibition technique. The results suggest that such sites are similar in size to those of rabbit and goat antibodies, and are capable of accommodating a peptide composed of four alanine residues...|$|R
40|$|Addition of {{hydroxyapatite}} (HyAp) microcrystals {{to human}} neutrophils results in exocytosis of specific granules, measured as lysozyme release, and plasma membrane damage, evident from lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. The strong hydrogen acceptor polyvinylpyridine-N-oxide {{has no effect}} on enzyme release, but polyanions and negatively charged proteins such as <b>albumin</b> strongly <b>inhibit</b> HyAp induced enzyme release. HyAp crystals cause only slightly less membrane damage in neutrophil cytoplasts than in intact neutrophils. Removal of sialic acid from the cells did not affect HyAp induced enzyme release. Glucose, trapped in negatively charged liposomes, is released by HyAp crystals, whereas the crystals do not release glucose from positively charged liposomes. The results indicate that positive charges located on the HyAp crystals are of predominant importance for the effect of the crystals, and that the lipid part of the membrane might play an important part in the interaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{cartilage}} and synovial fluid components such as proteoglycans, chondroitin sulphate, hyaluronic acid, phospholipids, and albumin {{on the growth}} kinetics of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSUM) crystals were investigated. MSUM seed crystals were added to supersaturated sodium urate solutions, {{and the rate of}} decrease in the concentration of growth medium was used as a measure of the growth rate. A second order dependence of growth rate on supersaturation was found, and growth rate constants were determined with an integrated form of the growth equation. The additives, hyaluronic acid, proteoglycan monomer and aggregate, and phosphatidylserine, had no significant effect on the growth rate constant. Chondroitin sulphate and phosphatidylcholine increased the growth rate constant, possibly by promoting further nucleation in the growth medium. <b>Albumin</b> significantly <b>inhibited</b> MSUM crystallisation. The possible implications of these findings on in vivo MSUM crystallisation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Putative living {{entities}} called nanobacteria (NB) are {{unusual for}} their small sizes (50 - 500 nm), pleomorphic nature, and accumulation of hydroxyapatite (HAP), {{and have been}} implicated in numerous diseases involving extraskeletal calcification. By adding precipitating ions to cell culture medium containing serum, mineral nanoparticles are generated that are morphologically and chemically identical to the so-called NB. These nanoparticles are shown here to be formed of amorphous mineral complexes containing calcium {{as well as other}} ions like carbonate, which then rapidly acquire phosphate, forming HAP. The main constituent proteins of serum-derived NB are albumin, fetuin-A, and apolipoprotein A 1, but their involvement appears circumstantial since so-called NB from different body fluids harbor other proteins. Accordingly, by passage through various culture media, the protein composition of these particles can be modulated. Immunoblotting experiments reveal that antibodies deemed specific for NB react in fact with either albumin, fetuin-A, or both, indicating that previous studies using these reagents may have detected these serum proteins from the same as well as different species, with human tissue nanoparticles presumably absorbing bovine serum antigens from the culture medium. Both fetal bovine serum and human serum, used earlier by other investigators as sources of NB, paradoxically inhibit the formation of these entities, and this inhibition is trypsin-sensitive, indicating a role for proteins in this inhibitory process. Fetuin-A, and to a lesser degree <b>albumin,</b> <b>inhibit</b> nanoparticle formation, an inhibition that is overcome with time, ending with formation of the so-called NB. Together, these data demonstrate that NB are most likely formed by calcium or apatite crystallization inhibitors that are somehow overwhelmed by excess calcium or calcium phosphate found in culture medium or in body fluids, thereby becoming seeds for calcification. The structures described earlier as NB may thus represent remnants and by-products of physiological mechanisms used for calcium homeostasis, a concept which explains the vast body of NB literature as well as explains the true origin of NB as lifeless protein-mineralo entities with questionable role in pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Interaction of {{uncoupling}} reagents with {{bovine serum}} <b>albumin</b> markedly <b>inhibited</b> its hydrolysis by proteolytic enzymes. The inhibition presumably {{is due to}} conformational transitions in the protein substrate induced by the binding of the ligand–uncoupling reagents. The proteolysis of casein, a protein that does not bind these reagents, was not affected, indicating that the proteinases themselves were not inactivated. In contrast, interaction of uncoupling reagents with freshly isolated rat liver mitochondria enhanced their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes. This was shown {{by an increase in}} the release of ninhydrin-reacting material, by an increase in free acid groups and by a decrease in the turbidity of the mitochondrial suspensions. These effects, although opposite in direction to those obtained with albumin, are also presumed to indicate structural changes in the mitochondrial proteins and a disorganization of the protein–phospholipid complex. It is suggested that such structural alterations are expressed functionally as the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation...|$|R
40|$|The chronic {{administration}} of N- 2 -acetylaminofluorene (N- 2 -AAF) to rats causes {{a loss of}} hepatic cytoplasmic RNA, particularly from the endoplasmic-membrane fractions.
