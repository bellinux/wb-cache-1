25|$|Fundraising also continued. The DVLMF {{contracted}} with Tom Brokaw, former NBC News anchor <b>and</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> The Greatest Generation (1998), {{to host a}} fundraiser in New York City in April 2004, and the estate of Jesse Brown (who died in 2002) agreed to donate the proceeds of Brown's book The Price of Their Blood: Profiles in Spirit (which documented the lives of 10 disabled veterans) to the memorial construction fund. But one fundraising effort was stalled. Senator Tim Johnson (D-South Dakota) introduced legislation in July 2003 to authorize the United States Mint to manufacture commemorative coins which would be sold {{to raise money for}} the memorial. The coins would sell for $10 each (with a legal tender face value of $1). The cost of manufacturing the coins would come from the sale price, with the remainder going to the memorial construction fund. Johnson submitted additional legislation in 2004 after the 2003 bill stalled. This legislation passed the Senate, but stalled in the House. Johnson's bill died at the end of the 108th Congress, locked in a House committee. Nevertheless, the DVLMF said in April 2004 construction on the memorial would begin in the spring of 2005.|$|E

[...] Nick Douglas explained that the group decided to shift their strategy away from the attacks to Scientology websites: [...] "Anonymous even decided that they were going to stop that attack, that it was a bad idea.
