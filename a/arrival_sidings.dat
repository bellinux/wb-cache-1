2500|$|The {{safety issue}} of a {{possible}} fire on a passenger-vehicle shuttle garnered much attention, with Eurotunnel noting that fire was the risk attracting the most attention in a 1994 safety case for three reasons: the opposition of ferry companies to passengers being allowed to remain with their cars; Home Office statistics indicating that car fires had doubled in ten years; and the long length of the tunnel. Eurotunnel commissioned the UK Fire Research Station - {{now part of the}} Building Research Establishment - to give reports of vehicle fires, and liaised with Kent Fire Brigade to gather vehicle fire statistics over one year. Fire tests took place at the French Mines Research Establishment with a mock wagon used to investigate how cars burned. The wagon door systems are designed to withstand fire inside the wagon for 30minutes, longer than the transit time of 27minutes. Wagon air conditioning units help to purge dangerous fumes from inside the wagon before travel. Each wagon has a fire detection and extinguishing system, with sensing of ions or ultraviolet radiation, smoke and gases that can trigger halon gas to quench a fire. Since the HGV wagons are not covered, fire sensors are located on the loading wagon and in the tunnel. A [...] water main in the service tunnel provides water to the main tunnels at [...] intervals. The ventilation system can control smoke movement. Special <b>arrival</b> <b>sidings</b> accept a train that is on fire, as the train is not allowed to stop whilst on fire in the tunnel, unless continuing its journey would lead to a worse outcome. Eurotunnel has banned a wide range of hazardous goods from travelling in the tunnel. Two STTS (Service Tunnel Transportation System) vehicles with firefighting pods are on duty at all times, with a maximum delay of 10minutes before they reach a burning train.|$|E
50|$|The Manchester-Sheffield-Wath {{electrification}} {{was extended}} {{into the yard}} in 1965 to allow electrically-hauled trains to the Manchester area to be handled. Seventeen miles of track from Woodburn Junction and Darnall Junction via Broughton Lane to the Reception Sidings at Catcliffe were electrified at 1500 V DC. The insulators were capable of being used at 6.25 kV AC if ever required, with the option of 25 kV AC with minimal conversion costs. Unlike similar electrified marshalling yards, to save on costs {{the main body of}} the sorting sidings was not electrified: a half of the <b>arrival</b> <b>sidings</b> was electrified for incoming electric trains; departing electric trains either had to use the southern third of the main sorting sidings (the western part of which were wired for electric trains) or had to be drawn out of the main sorting sidings by diesel locomotives into electrified departure roads where the electric locomotives were attached.|$|E
5000|$|On 17 December 1984 the <b>arrival</b> <b>sidings</b> and hump were closed, the wagon-control system {{removed and}} the {{remaining}} Class 13s scrapped. The under-utilised Grimesthorpe Freight Terminal was severely damaged by a major fire on 14 December 1984 and was relegated to being a steel-loading facility. The yard connections were relaid to allow easier handling of block-load trains which now dominated rail freight in Britain. By 1995 the decline in British heavy industry meant {{that this type of}} traffic had also declined massively, resulting in the closure of the locomotive depot on 27 March 1998. [...] The eastern connections (both North and South facing chords) to the Midland 'Old Road' had been closed in 1993 however the track is still in situ, and the western connection to the Midland Main Line (and goods depot at Grimesthorpe) at Brightside junction was lifted in 1999. Both chords to the ex MSLR/GCR line from Woodburn to Rotherham (via Broughton Lane junc and Tinsley South junc) remain open. The rest of the yard progressively fell into disuse over the next ten years.|$|E
50|$|The <b>arrival</b> and {{departure}} <b>sidings</b> contain two {{connections to}} the West Coast main line onto the up slow. At {{the east end of}} the depot, there is a trailing crossover to permit access onto the down slow when coming off depot.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} utilised software {{developed for}} managing the Australian sugar industry's cane rail transport operations and GPS data used to track locomotives to ensure safe operation of the railway system to improve transport operations. As a result, time usage in the sugarcane railway can now be summarised and locomotive <b>arrival</b> time to <b>sidings</b> and mills can be predicted. This information will help {{the development of more}} efficient run schedules and enable mill staff and harvesters to better plan their shifts ahead, enabling cost reductions through better use of available time...|$|R
5000|$|The depot was {{designed}} in the 1960s, to service electric locomotive classes AL1 to AL6 (TOPS classes 81 to 86) and subsequently class 87s, and consists of six parallel shed roads (each holding four locomotives inside the shed) and several <b>arrivals</b> and departure <b>sidings</b> externally. There is also a road that runs round {{to the north of}} the shed and this provides access to the fuel siding, (which for many years was used only for the occasional fueling of diesel shunters), and also to the DC lines of Willesden Junction Low Level station, which is used to move multiple units from the shed onto the North London Line after servicing.|$|R
