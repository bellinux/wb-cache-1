40|$|Radar {{backscatter}} from abandoned circular alfalfa {{fields in}} the Manix Basin area of the Mojave desert shows systematic changes with length <b>of</b> <b>abandonment.</b> The obliteration <b>of</b> circular planting rows by surface processes {{could account for the}} disappearance of bright spokes, which seem to be reflection patterns from remnants of the planting rows, with increasing length <b>of</b> <b>abandonment.</b> An observed shift in the location of the maximum L-band copolarization return away from VV, as well as an increase in surface roughness, both occurring with increasing age <b>of</b> <b>abandonment,</b> seems to be attributable to the formation of wind ripples on the relatively vegetationless fields...|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} {{levels of}} the Quiriguá valley increased rapidly after the successful rebellion against Copán in 738, although {{it was never a}} heavily populated site. In the 9thcentury there was a severe decline in population, culminating in the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} this drastic {{population}} reduction {{are thought to be}} due to agricultural improvements, <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> extensive management, and deforestation.

40|$|Critics pay little {{attention}} to fear of death in Gulliver’s Travels. This paper aims {{to deal with the}} issue with Freud’s theory. According to Freud, fear of death results in death drive. In Gulliver’s Travels, the episodes of the Struldbruggs and the Houyhnhnms reveal fear of death. In the episode of Struldbruggs, fear of death is illustrated through fear <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> and fear <b>of</b> loss. Fear <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> and fear <b>of</b> loss cause the Struldbruggs to long for physical death to end emotional death. In the episode of Houyhnhnms, fear of death is represented by fear of intimacy. Fear of intimacy is expressed in Houyhnhnms’ cold attitudes to their friends and their family members...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} abandonment {{as measured by the}} Feelings <b>of</b> <b>Abandonment</b> Scale (FOAS), and use of illicit drugs. It was hypothesized that individuals who used illicit drugs would score higher on the (FOAS) than non-users. This study also evaluated whether there were differences in levels <b>of</b> feelings <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> among opiate users compared to non-opiate users, and college students versus those receiving treatment for substance abuse. The two groups were administered the FOAS, and t-tests and multivariate t-tests were conducted to evaluate whether differences existed between these two groups. Significant differences in FOAS scores were noted among opiate users compared to non-opiate users, and the college versus treatment groups. The study failed to find a significant relationship between feelings <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> and presence <b>of</b> a substance use disorder. Other findings and implications for further research are discussed. Identification <b>of</b> <b>abandonment</b> as a counseling issue and recommendations for treatment are suggested. ...|$|R
