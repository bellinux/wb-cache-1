5|$|After a punitive {{operation}} {{was conducted in}} the surrounding villages, during which 422males were shot and four villages burned down, another 70male Jews and communists who had been arrested in Kragujevac were shot. Simultaneously, males {{between the ages of}} 16and 60, including high school students, were assembled by German troops and local collaborators, and the victims were selected from amongst them. The selected males were then marched to fields outside the city, shot with heavy machine guns, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> buried in mass graves. Contemporary German military records indicate that 2,300hostages were shot. After the war, inflated estimates ranged as high as 7,000deaths, but German and Serbian scholars have now agreed on the figure of nearly 2,800killed, including 144high school students. As well as Serbs, other massacre victims included Jews, Romani people, Muslims, Macedonians, Slovenes and members of other nationalities.|$|E

At least ten civilians were killed at Žitnik in the Gospić area known as Pazarište on 17 October. The killings continued at Lipova Glavica near Perušić on 18 October, where 39 or 40 people were executed by firing squad after being held in the Perušić barracks, where a battalion of the 118th Infantry Brigade was based at the time.

5|$|The Baćin {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 83 civilians just outside the village of Baćin, near Hrvatska Dubica, committed by Croatian Serb paramilitaries. The killings took place on 21 October 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence. Most of the civilians were Croats, but they also included two ethnic Serbs, taken from Hrvatska Dubica, Baćin and the nearby village of Cerovljani. The civilians {{were killed in the}} area of Krečane, at the very bank of the Una River, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> were left unburied for two weeks.

5|$|The Three Witches of Macbeth have {{inspired}} several painters {{over the years}} who have sought to capture the supernatural darkness surrounding Macbeth's encounters with them. For example, by the eighteenth century, belief in witches had waned in the United Kingdom. Such things {{were thought to be}} the simple stories of foreigners, farmers, and superstitious Catholics. However art depicting supernatural subjects was very popular. John Runciman, {{as one of the first}} artists to use Shakespearean characters in his work, created an ink-on-paper drawing entitled The Three Witches in 1767–68. In it, three ancient figures are shown in close consultation, their heads together <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> unshown. Runciman's brother created another drawing of the witches called The Witches show Macbeth The Apparitions painted circa 1771–1772, portraying Macbeth's reaction to the power of the witches' conjured vision. Both brothers' work influenced many later artists by removing the characters from the familiar theatrical setting and placing them in the world of the story.|$|E
5|$|Twins were {{subjected}} to weekly examinations and measurements of their physical attributes by Mengele {{or one of his}} assistants. Experiments performed by Mengele on twins included unnecessary amputation of limbs, intentionally infecting one twin with typhus or other diseases, and transfusing the blood of one twin into the other. Many of the victims died while undergoing these procedures. After an experiment was over, the twins were sometimes killed <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> dissected. Nyiszli recalled one occasion where Mengele personally killed fourteen twins in one night via a chloroform injection to the heart. If one twin died of disease, Mengele killed the other so that comparative post-mortem reports could be prepared.|$|E

5|$|As {{the force}} which {{was sent to}} {{reinforce}} and extract the reconnaissance platoon took further casualties, the total Croatian losses in the fighting and its immediate aftermath amounted to 20 killed. The fate of the reconnaissance platoon was not immediately known to Croatian authorities or relatives of the troops for months, adding fuel to an already volatile atmosphere {{in the city of}} Bjelovar, where the 105th Brigade was originally based. This tension erupted a week later, with the blockade and capture of the JNA barracks in Bjelovar. The JNA denied it had any knowledge on the fate of the Croatian soldiers. Details of their deaths became known in December 1991. Croatian forces recaptured Kusonje on 30 December in Operation Papuk-91, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> were exhumed in January 1992. Along with the soldiers, the bodies of 23 civilians were also exhumed from a mass grave in the village of Rakov Potok. The soldiers were re-interred in Bjelovar on 5 February 1992. According to JNA intelligence reports, during the period from the exhumation to the re-interment, 32 Serb-owned houses in Bjelovar were demolished in retribution for the killings.|$|E

After {{returning}} to the town, they discover that several {{years have passed since}} they left, as time speeds up away from the spiral. The other citizens have expanded the terraced houses until they connect into a single structure forming a spiral pattern. Kirie and Shuichi decide to search for Kirie's parents, which brings them {{to the center of the}} spiral. At the center, they fall down a pit, within which they discover the corpses of Kirie's parents and an ancient city completely covered with spiral patterns. Shuichi urges Kirie to move forward and find a way to stop the curse, but she replies that she does not have the strength and wishes to stay with him. The two embrace each other, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> twist and wrap together as a result of the curse. As they lie together, Kirie notes that the curse ended at the same time it began, for just as time speeds up away from the center, it freezes at the center, and concludes that the curse is eternal, and all the events will repeat when a new Kurōzu-cho is built where the previous one laid.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc {{objected to}} the use of his troops in the attack on Royan in April 1945. As a result, only part of 2e DB was employed. The {{division}} rejoined Seventh Army, crossing the Rhine on 25 April, and joining the pursuit into Bavaria. Leclerc visited Dachau concentration camp after its liberation by the Americans. In an incident that took place 8 May 1945 at Bad Reichenhall in Bavaria, he was presented with a defiant group of captured Frenchmen of the SS Charlemagne Division. He asked them why they wore a German uniform, to which one of them replied by asking why Leclerc wore an American one. Leclerc told his men to get rid of them. That was taken as a death sentence. The group of French Waffen-SS men was summarily executed by the RMT without any form of military tribunal procedure, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> left where they fell until an American burial team collected them.

5|$|Mating is {{initiated}} when {{up to five}} males follow closely {{behind a}} female and bite at her fins and body, possibly cued by pheromones indicating the female's readiness. Each male attempts to seize the female by engulfing one of her pectoral fins; at times two males might grasp a female on both sides simultaneously. Once engaged, the sharks sink to the bottom, whereupon the male (or males) rotates one of his claspers forward, inflates the associated siphon sac (a subcutaneous abdominal organ that takes in seawater {{that is used to}} flush sperm into the female), and attempts to make contact with the female's vent. In many cases, the female resists by pressing her belly against the bottom and arching her tail; this may reflect mate choice on her part. The male has a limited time in which to achieve copulation, as while he is holding the female's pectoral fin in his mouth he is being deprived of oxygen. On the other hand, if the female is willing, the pair settles side-by-side with their heads pressed against the bottom <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> at an upward angle.|$|E
