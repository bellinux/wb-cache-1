5|$|Following German reunification, the US {{government}} {{announced plans to}} fully withdraw its troops from Frankfurt, Germany by 1995, at which time control of the entire site would be restored to the German Federal Government. It was suggested that the building could become the location for the European Central Bank. In 1996, the state of Hesse bought the building and <b>associated</b> <b>land</b> for the University of Frankfurt. The buildings were refurbished {{at a cost of}} 50 Million German Mark (about US $26M or 25M €), by the Copenhagen-based architecture practice Dissing+Weitling and were handed over to the university. The complex now houses the Westend Campus of the university, which includes the departments of Philosophy, History, Theology, Classical Philology, Art and Music, Modern Languages and Linguistics, Cultural and Civilization Studies, the Center for North American Studies and the Fritz-Bauer-Institute.|$|E
5|$|The CTRL project saw new {{bridges and}} tunnels built, with a {{combined}} length nearly {{as long as the}} Channel Tunnel itself, and significant archaeological research undertaken. In 2002, the CTRL project was awarded the Major Project Award at the British Construction Industry Awards. The line was transferred to government ownership in 2009, with a 30-year concession for its operation being put up for sale in June 2010. The concession was awarded to a consortium of Borealis Infrastructure (part of Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System) and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan in November 2010, but does not include the freehold or rights to any of the <b>associated</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E

25|$|Part of {{the system}} through {{downtown}} is planned to be transferred underground when needed to maintain reliable service. Given this, portions of the needed infrastructure have been built as adjacent and <b>associated</b> <b>land</b> was developed. As {{a result of this}} original plan, when the City of Calgary built a new Municipal Building, it built a short section of tunnel to connect the existing CPR tunnel to the future tunnel under 8th Avenue S. The turnoff to this station is visible in the tunnel on the Red Line entering downtown from the south, shortly before City Hall. However, after urban explorers discovered the tunnel and visited it during a transit strike, the city walled off the spur tunnel with concrete blocks.|$|E
25|$|The first {{administration}} of Olusegun Obasanjo was {{a continuation of}} the Muritala Mohammed administration, and was focused on completing the transition program to democracy, as well as implementing the national development plans. Major projects including building new refineries, pipelines, expanding the national shipping and airlines as well as hosting FESTAC was done during the administration. A number of these national projects were conduits to distribute favors and enrich connected politicians. The famous Afrobeat musician, Fela Kuti, sang variously about major scandals involving the international telecommunication firm ITT led by Chief MKO Abiola in Nigeria, which the then Head of State, Gen Olusegun Obasanjo was associated with. In addition to this, the Operation Feed the Nation Program, and the <b>associated</b> <b>land</b> grab under the Land Use Decree implemented by the then Head of State was used as conduits to reward cronies, and his now famous Otta Farm Nigeria (OFN) was supposedly a project borne out of this scandal.|$|E
25|$|Settlement policy, set by {{the federal}} government, the Canadian Pacific Railway, the Hudson's Bay Company and <b>associated</b> <b>land</b> {{companies}} encouraged immigration. The key event was the decision to emulate the American Homestead Law by offering, at no cost, 160 acres of farmland to any man over 18 (or to a woman head of family) who settled there. Dramatic advertising campaigns promoted the benefits of prairie living. Potential immigrants read leaflets information painted Canada as a veritable garden of Eden, and downplayed the need for agricultural expertise. Ads in The Nor'-West Farmer by the Commissioner of Immigration implied that western land was blessed with water, wood, gold, silver, iron, copper, and cheap coal for fuel, {{all of which were}} readily at hand. Reality was far harsher, especially for the first arrivals who lived in sod houses. However eastern money poured in and by 1913, long term mortgage loans to Saskatchewan farmers had reached $65 million.|$|E

In 2005, the lower floor of the ranch house was opened to the public; it features exhibits about the cultural history of the region. The Thomas Condon Paleontology Center, a $7.5million museum and visitor center at the Sheep Rock Unit, also opened in 2005. Among the center's offerings are displays of fossils, murals depicting life in the basin during eight geologic times ranging from about 45million to about 5million years ago, and views of the paleontology laboratory.|$|E
500|$|There was a Presbyterian visiting preacher in Hagley, from Deloraine, Tasmania, from 1854. Services {{were held}} {{at this time in}} the Methodist Chapel. Regular Presbyterian {{services}} were being held by 1855, most likely in the original Church of England building. In the late 1870s, the old Church of England was purchased, along with the <b>associated</b> <b>land,</b> by the Presbyterian church for 265 pounds. The building was demolished in 1878 and construction of a new church was begun almost on the same site. During demolition and construction, Presbyterian services were again held at the Methodist chapel. The foundation stone was laid 18 March 1879 by which time the walls were already nearly complete. Cement rendering has hidden the stone and its location is uncertain. [...] Hagley Presbyterian Church's first services were held on 14 December 1879. A manse was built nearby in 1884.|$|E

[...] Crawley's first permanent cinema, the Imperial, was established nearby in 1911, replacing a temporary structure; it burnt down in 1928 but was rebuilt, only to be superseded by a larger building in the town centre in the 1930s. [...] It has been a car dealership since the 1940s. [...] Further down the Brighton Road, near the Hogs Hill Farm where Iron Age remains were later found, the Half Moon Inn and Hotel {{was built in the}} late 19th century, and rebuilt in 1890. [...] To the west, Goffs Park was established as a parkland and recreational area by the early 20th century.

50|$|The area {{now known}} as Courthouse Square in Kankakee, Illinois was {{originally}} used by the Pottawatomi as a council ground. European settlement began in 1832 with the Treaty of Camp Tippecanoe. In 1851, the Illinois Central Railroad decided to build a station {{in what is now}} Kankakee. The <b>Associates</b> <b>Land</b> Company, formed by supporters of the Illinois Central, purchased and platted the land around the station, calling it Kankakee Depot. When Kankakee County was formed in 1853, Kankakee Depot competed with Momence to be named county seat. The influence of the <b>Associates</b> <b>Land</b> Company, who offered to donate a large block of land and $5000 for a courthouse, swayed voters to select Kankakee Depot as seat.|$|R
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the debacle Nicholson returned to London, taking four Indian chiefs with him, and petitioned Queen Anne for permission to lead a more limited expedition against Port Royal, the capital of French Acadia. [...] The Queen granted the petition, and Nicholson {{was in charge of the}} forces that captured Port Royal on 2 October 1710. [...] This battle marked the conquest of Acadia, and began permanent British control over the territory they called Nova Scotia. [...] Nicholson published an account of the expedition in his 1711 Journal of an Expedition for the Reduction of Port Royal. The victorious Nicholson returned to England to petition Queen Anne for another expedition to capture the center of New France, Quebec. [...] The resulting naval expedition was led by Admiral Hovenden Walker, and Nicholson led an <b>associated</b> <b>land</b> expedition that retraced the route he had taken in 1709 toward Lake Champlain. [...] Many ships of Walker's fleet foundered on rocks near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River, and the whole expedition was cancelled, much to Nicholson's anger; he was reported to tear off his wig and throw it to the ground when he heard the news.|$|E

[...] On December 31, 1994, Central Mercedita stopped the milling of sugarcane, but continued its sugar refining operations to accommodate other sugar cane mills in Puerto Rico that depended on it for their milling operations. However, 1994 is generally considered the closing date for the sugar mill. Shortly afterwards, sugar refining at Mercedita stopped altogether with the closing of the remaining sugarcane farms in the island.
