40|$|A new method, {{reversed}} <b>air</b> <b>staging,</b> for decreasing N 2 O from {{fluidised bed}} combustion, {{was investigated in}} a 12 MW circulating fluidised bed boiler. Previous measurements, showing that the N 2 O is decreased to one fourth (25 ppm), and NO to half(40 ppm) with maintained sulphur capture, were confirmed. Supplementary information on reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> was obtained from additional measurements. By adjusting the temperature and the air ratio {{it was possible to}} reduce the CO emission. Thus, the N 2 O emission can be reduced to the level of 25 ppm, with the emissions of NO, SO 2 and CO maintained at about same level as with normal <b>air</b> <b>staging.</b> Low load in combination with reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> resulted in:further reduced emissions.

Emission of NO and CO along {{the height of the}} furnace was monitored by a gas analyzer on line, and the content of unburned carbon (UBC) in fly ash was also tested. The effects of fuel type, temperature, co-firing and <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> ratio were considered. Results showed that along the height of the furnace, NO concentration increased first and then decreased slowly for all the fuels, and NO emission from straw or wood combustion only accounted for about 1 / 3 or 1 / 2 of that from coal combustion respectively. In the present temperature range of 900 - 1100 oC, the increasing in temperature increased NO emission but decreased UBC in some degree, while the effect on CO emission was little. Under the condition of biomass co-firing, NO emission, CO emission and UBC were significantly reduced more with the increasing in biomass co-firing ratio. Moreover, results of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> combustion showed that for coal combustion <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> notably reduced NO emission while increased UBC and CO emission, but for biomass combustion the effect of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> was less significant. Further test of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> on biomass co-firing indicated that only under the co-firing ratio of 0. 4 could <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> play a great influence on NO emission and combustion efficiency.

40|$|Abstract - Two {{methods for}} the {{reduction}} of nitrous oxide emissions, afterbuming and reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging,</b> are investigated in a 12 MW circulating fluidized bed boiler. With afterburning the N 2 O emission can be reduced by 90 % or more, using an amount of secondary fuel corresponding to 10 % of the total energy input. With reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> {{it is possible to}} reduce the emission of N 2 O to one fourth (25 ppm), without significantly affecting the other emissions. With reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> no secondary air is used in the combustor and an air-ratio of about unity is maintained throughout the combustion chamber.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>staging</b> is a {{well-known}} effective method to control NOx emissions from solid fuel combustion boilers. However, further research is still needed to clarify the effect of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> at different injection locations on the gaseous emissions of Fluidised Bed Combustion (FBC) boilers that fire 100 % biomass fuels, particularly non-woody biomass fuels. The main objective of this work is to investigate {{the effect of the}} staging air injection location on the gaseous emissions (NOx and CO) and temperature profiles of a 20 kWth bubbling fluidised bed combustor firing three non-woody (straw, miscanthus and peanuts) and two woody biomass fuels. The experimental results showed that injecting the secondary air at the higher location could lead to a greater NOx reduction {{due to the fact that}} the biomass combustion reaction mainly took place in the splash zone and/or beginning of the freeboard. Up to 30 % of NOx reduction, compared with no <b>air</b> <b>staging,</b> was achieved for the non-woody fuels when the staging air was injected at the higher position. <b>Air</b> <b>staging</b> also significantly reduced the CO emissions as a result of the higher temperatures in the freeboard and longer residence time in the primary combustion zone...|$|E

40|$|Reversed <b>air</b> <b>staging,</b> {{a method}} for {{reduction}} of N 2 O emissions, was studied in a 12 MW circulating fluidized bed boiler. The effect of combustor air-ratio, bed temperature, load and limestone addition ratio was investigated. The results indicate that if only the air distribution is changed, the emission of N 2 O can be decreased to one fourth compared to normal <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> at a temperature of 850 °C, with maintained low emissions of NO,´SO 2 and CO. With increased bed temperature, 870 °C, in combination with increased limestone addition, from Ca/S molar ratio = 3 to 4, {{it was possible to}} reduce N 2 O by 90 vol% with low emissions of NO, SO 2 and CO. The method was less efficient at low load, because of the lower cyclone temperature. Also the effect of redistribution of some of the air added in the cyclone outlet to the cyclone inlet was studied. This did not, however, give any improvement in the boiler used compared to adding all of the air in the cyclone outlet.

The minimum NO (37 % reduction than non-staged) measured in the non-uniform air distribution module at the higher flow rate with lower distance from the fuel bed.

In this study, two different secondary air distribution modules are employed at two different axial positions {{from the bed}} surface in a 15 kW fixed-bed laboratory scale combustion system includes grate and underfeed bed stocker. The effects of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> on temperature, burning rate, gaseous and particulate emissions have been assessed over a selected primary air flow rate {{and a range of}} secondary air flow rates. Secondary air inlet module with uniform distribution of air results in 50 % CO reduction by shifting the combustion to a more fuel lean environment and high temperature in the post-combustion zone. Remarkable decrease in particulate matters smaller than 1 μm is achievable through adjusting a uniform secondary air module in an appropriate distance from the bed. The non-uniform secondary air configuration increases the gaseous and particulate emissions than the uniform configuration. These results emphasise the need for further studies to better understand the effect of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> on particulate and gaseous emissions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Combustion implicates {{harmful effect}} to the {{environment}} due to the emissions produced. The release of gaseous emissions such as oxides of nitrogen (NOX) and carbon monoxide (CO) into the atmosphere create major environment problems. These gaseous emissions affect plants, human being and animals. High concentration of emissions brings fatal effects to life form. <b>Air</b> <b>staging</b> or two-stage combustion, is generally described as the introduction of additional/secondary air into the boiler or furnace. Staging the air into the burner (internal <b>air</b> <b>staging)</b> is generally one of the design features of low NOX burner. Staged combustion is the technique in which a high temperature, fuel rich primary zone is generated with a sufficient residence time to minimize the total fixed nitrogen that is formed in the primary zone. The secondary air mixes downstream of the primary zone to complete the combustion. Staged combustion is an effective method of controlling thermal NOX. A study has been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> in reducing emissions from combustion process. A liquid fuel burner system with 280 mm inside diameter combustor of 1000 mm length has been investigated. All tests were conducted using commercial diesel as fuel. The study shows that a much lower NOX emissions were obtained for the staged combustion {{when compared to the}} non-staged combustion. Significant reduction of more than 15 percent of NOX emissions reduction was obtained...|$|E
40|$|Emission {{from the}} {{combustion}} processes can cause adverse effect to the environment. The formation of pollutants such as NOx, CO, CO 2 and SOx are hazardous and {{harmful to the}} ecosystem. The awareness about the pollution due to the combustion activities, particularly in industrial field has set off {{an effort to find}} more comprehensive and enhanced technologies to reduce these pollutants. There are several methods {{that can be used to}} reduce the emissions of these pollutants either by combustion modifications or post combustion treatment. In this research, the method used is the post combustion treatment, i. e. the <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> method. By <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> techniques, some of the combustion air will be directed into the primary combustion zone, while the remaining air is directed into the secondary zone. The function of the secondary air is to reduce the peak flame temperatures, which theoretically reduce the emissions of NOx emissions. The primary concern for this research is to study the effectiveness of the <b>air</b> <b>staging</b> in reducing NOx, CO, SO 2, and UHC emissions from the combustion process. The results obtained showed significant reduction in all major pollutants, i. e., a 31. 8 percent reduction for CO emission, 16. 8 percent for NOx, 12. 7 percent for SO 2 and 10. 3 percent for UHC.
