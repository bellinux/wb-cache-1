5|$|From the 9th century, {{waves of}} Viking raiders plundered Irish monasteries and towns. These raids <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pattern of raiding and endemic warfare {{that was already}} {{deep-seated}} in Ireland. The Vikings also were involved in establishing {{most of the major}} coastal settlements in Ireland: Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Wexford, Waterford, as well as other smaller settlements.|$|E
5|$|The Railways Act 1921 brought most of {{the large}} coal-exporting docks in South Wales into the GWR's ownership, such as those at Cardiff, Barry, and Swansea.

5|$|Also in 1936, SH-74 began {{expanding}} northward. On August 18, {{the designation}} was <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new section of highway between Crescent and US-64 (now State Highway 164) in Covington. Nearly a year later, the route was extended southward again. The State Highway Commission lengthened SH-74 through Goldsby and Purcell to SH-19 in Maysville on July 1, 1937. The section of highway from Covington to US-60 in Lamont was added on April 14, 1941. On June 5, 1945, it was extended further south to SH-29 in Elmore City (at the time simply named Elmore).|$|E
5|$|In February 1998, Archie Comics adapted Nights into Dreams into a three-issue {{comic book}} miniseries {{to test whether}} or not a Nights comic would sell well in North America. The first miniseries was loosely based on the game, with Nights being {{specifically}} identified as a male despite the character's androgynous design. The company later released a second three-issue miniseries, continuing the story of the first, but the series did not gain enough sales to warrant an ongoing series. The series would later be <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> list of guest franchises featured in Archie Comics' Worlds Unite crossover between its Sonic the Hedgehog and Mega Man titles.|$|E
5|$|In November 1926, AASHTO officially {{approved}} the United States Numbered Highways system. The Oklahoma Transportation Commission applied the national highways to Oklahoma's state highway system on 1926-11-26. Three U.S. highways {{were assigned to}} portions of what was then SH-8: U.S. Highway 64 was <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> segment of highway south of Cherokee, U.S. Highway 66 was added between Bridgeport and Geary, and U.S. Highway 70 was added from the Texas state line to Randlett. US-66 and 64 merely ran concurrently with SH-8. However, US-70 completely replaced the state highway, which was truncated so that its southern terminus was at US-70 in Randlett.|$|E

5|$|Less {{expensive}} cloth paintings (tüchlein) {{were more}} common in middle-class households, and records show {{a strong interest in}} domestically owned religious panel paintings. Members of the merchant class typically commissioned smaller devotional panels, containing specified subject matter. Alterations varied from having individualised panels <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> prefabricated pattern, to the inclusion of a donor portrait. The addition of coats-of-arms were often the only change – an addition seen in van der Weyden's Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin, which exists in several variations.|$|E
5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in November 1974. In the game, ducks fly {{one at a}} time across the screen, and the player shoots at them using a light gun attached to the game cabinet. The player gets three shots per duck; ducks change direction away from missed shots and fall {{to the bottom of the}} screen when hit. A screen overlay adds images of reeds and a tree branch, and an image of a duck is <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> row at the top of the screen whenever a duck is hit. Games continue until a time limit, set by the machine operator, is reached.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{chromate}} {{is produced}} industrially by the oxidative roasting of chromite ore with calcium or sodium carbonate. The dominant species is therefore, {{by the law}} of mass action, determined by the pH of the solution. The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (chromate) to orange (dichromate), such as when an acid is <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> neutral solution of potassium chromate. At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex oxyanions of chromium is possible.|$|E

5|$|Tests {{exist to}} measure how much {{sensation}} a person has retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people {{who are able to}} achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap can be <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vibrator or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function.|$|E
5|$|The Naval Ministry {{solicited}} new bids on 8 September from 23 shipbuilders, {{domestic and}} foreign, but only seven responded, {{even after the}} deadline was extended by a month. A number of designs were rejected for not meeting the revised criteria. In the meantime, the Artillery Section of the Main Administration of Shipbuilding had decided that it preferred a four-turret design, and new bids were solicited in May 1912 from the leading contenders from {{the first round of}} bidding. The eventual winner was a design by the Admiralty Works in Saint Petersburg, which had the extra turret <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new hull section inserted into the original three-turret design.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{is home to}} many {{cultures}} and {{a wide variety of}} ethnic groups, traditions, and values. Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries. Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa. More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.|$|E

5|$|The {{difficulties}} with Garrard's election over Benjamin Logan in 1795 <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> litany {{of complaints about}} the state's first constitution. Some {{believed that it was}} undemocratic because it required electors to choose the governor and state senators and many offices were appointive rather than elective. Others opposed life terms for judges and other state officials. Still others wanted slavery excluded from the document, or to lift the ban on ministers serving in the General Assembly. In the aftermath of the disputed 1795 election, all parties involved agreed that changes were needed. The present constitution provided no means for amendment, however. The only remedy was another constitutional convention.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} affinity of an atom {{is the amount}} of energy released when an electron is <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> neutral atom to form a negative ion. Although {{electron affinity}} varies greatly, some patterns emerge. Generally, nonmetals have more positive electron affinity values than metals. Chlorine most strongly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been measured conclusively, so {{they may or may not}} have slightly negative values.|$|E

Guest then returned to Rhodesia with his family, who had spent most of the war in England.|$|E
