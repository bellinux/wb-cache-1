5|$|Chroniclers Richard of Devizes, William of Newburgh, Roger of Hoveden <b>and</b> <b>Ralph</b> de Diceto were {{generally}} unsympathetic to John's behaviour under Richard, but {{more tolerant of}} the earliest years of John's reign. Accounts of the middle and later years of his reign are limited to Gervase of Canterbury <b>and</b> <b>Ralph</b> of Coggeshall, neither of whom were satisfied with John's performance as king. His later negative reputation was established by two chroniclers writing after the king's death: Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. The latter claimed that John attempted to convert to Islam, {{but this is not}} believed by modern historians.|$|E
5|$|Tony <b>and</b> <b>Ralph</b> {{invest in}} a race horse named Pie-O-My, who wins several races and makes them both {{a great deal of}} money. However, when Ralph's 12-year-old son Justin is {{severely}} injured when an arrow plunges into his chest, Tony comes to believe Ralph burned Pie-O-My in a stable fire to collect $200,000 in insurance money. Tony confronts Ralph the following morning <b>and</b> <b>Ralph</b> denies setting the fire. The two engage in a violent brawl, culminating in Tony strangling Ralph to death. Tony and Christopher dispose of the body; they bury his head and hands at Mikey Palmice's father's farm and throw his body into a quarry.|$|E

Angry, Lisa snaps, stating that she had never liked him and that the only reason she gave him a Valentine was because nobody else would. Later at home, Bart takes the moment to replay that scene to Lisa in which Ralph is humiliated and deeply hurt. Lisa soon feels guilty and regrets her actions in hurting Ralph's feelings.|$|E

5|$|Although Massachusetts was {{the first}} slave-holding colony {{dating back to the}} early 1600s, in the years leading up to the American Civil War, Massachusetts was a center of progressivist and {{abolitionist}} activity. Horace Mann made the state's school system a national model. Henry David Thoreau <b>and</b> <b>Ralph</b> Waldo Emerson made major contributions to American philosophy. Members of the transcendentalist movement emphasized the importance of the natural world and emotion to humanity.|$|E

5|$|Docter began {{developing}} {{the film in}} 1996, and wrote the story with Jill Culton, Jeff Pidgeon, <b>and</b> <b>Ralph</b> Eggleston. Fellow Pixar director Andrew Stanton wrote the screenplay with screenwriter Daniel Gerson. The characters went through many incarnations over the film's five-year production process. The technical team and animators found new ways to render fur and cloth realistically for the film. Randy Newman, who composed the music for Pixar's three prior films, returned to compose its fourth.|$|E

In subsequent decades, it has received both praise and criticism from specialists in the field, who have lauded the publicity which it brought to the subject, but rejected many of Glob's conclusions as being based on insufficient evidence.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{interpretations of}} John {{have been subject}} to {{considerable}} change over the years. Medieval chroniclers provided the first contemporary, or near contemporary, histories of John's reign. One group of chroniclers wrote early in John's life, or around the time of his accession, including Richard of Devizes, William of Newburgh, Roger of Hoveden <b>and</b> <b>Ralph</b> de Diceto. These historians were generally unsympathetic to John's behaviour under Richard's rule, but slightly more positive towards the very earliest years of John's reign. Reliable accounts of the middle and later parts of John's reign are more limited, with Gervase of Canterbury <b>and</b> <b>Ralph</b> of Coggeshall writing the main accounts; neither of them were positive about John's performance as king. Much of John's later, negative reputation was established by two chroniclers writing after the king's death, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris, the latter claiming that John attempted conversion to Islam in exchange for military aid from the Almohad ruler Muhammad al-Nasir – a story modern historians consider untrue.|$|E
