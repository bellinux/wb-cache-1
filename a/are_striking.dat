In some regions less than 2 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics; in other regions up to 80 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was well-received in Serbia and abroad; {{it has since}} attained iconic status in Serbian popular culture. An allusion to it is made in Emir Kusturica's 1995 film Underground, in which war refugees are depicted marching towards Belgrade in similar fashion, following the German bombing {{of the city in}} April 1941. Several authors have noted similarities between Jovanović's depiction of the migration and images of other upheavals in Serbian history. Historian Katarina Todić observes that there <b>are</b> <b>striking</b> similarities between the painting and photographs of the Royal Serbian Army's retreat to the Adriatic coast during World War I. Judah remarks that the composition resembles images of the exodus of Krajina Serbs following Croatia's Operation Storm in August 1995.|$|E

25|$|Topoxte was an {{important}} site in the Postclassic and had close ties {{with the city of}} Mayapan in the north of the Yucatán Peninsula. It was fortified and probably served as {{an important}} nexus in the trade routes between the Maya highlands and the Yucatán. It was a small capital with about six temples and a similar number of open halls. As well as strong ties with Mayapan, there <b>are</b> <b>striking</b> similarities with sites of the Tulum group, indicating that these sites belong to the same specific cultural tradition.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>striking</b> {{parallels}} between the 11th-century legend of Ursula {{and the story of}} Sunniva of Selje. Their names were sometimes confused by contemporaries. Both saints were considered to be Christian princesses who fled their homeland by ship in order to postpone or avert an undesired marriage with a pagan king. Both were accompanied by a large group of associates, both became victims of hostile foes. The development of their legends may have been interdependent. The martyrdom of Sunniva, however, took place after the first draft of the Passio Ursulae.|$|E
25|$|Shafarevich {{argued that}} ancient {{socialism}} (such as Mesopotamia and Egypt) was not ideological, as an ideology socialism was {{a reaction to}} the emergence of individualism in the Axial Age. He compared Thomas More's (Utopia) and Campanella's (City of the Sun) visions with what is known about the Inca Empire, and concluded that there <b>are</b> <b>striking</b> similarities. He claimed that we become persons through our relationship with God, and argued that socialism is essentially nihilistic, unconsciously motivated by a death instinct. He concluded that we have the choice of either pursuing death or life.|$|E

25|$|The French Revolution {{began in}} 1789 with the {{convocation}} of the Estates-General in May. The {{first year of}} the Revolution witnessed members of the Third Estate proclaiming the Tennis Court Oath in June, the Storming of the Bastille in July. The two key events that marked the triumph of liberalism were the Abolition of feudalism in France on the night of 4 August 1789, which marked the collapse of feudal and old traditional rights and privileges and restrictions, and the passage of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in August. Jefferson, the American ambassador to France, was consulted in its drafting and there <b>are</b> <b>striking</b> similarities with the American Declaration of Independence.|$|E
25|$|Penalties {{are awarded}} {{if a player}} is caught offside, is {{involved}} in foul play, offends at the tackle, ruck or maul, or is involved in dangerous play at scrums and line-outs. Foul play includes intentionally or repeatedly offending, throwing the ball into touch, obstructing the opposition, or misconduct. Examples of misconduct <b>are</b> <b>striking,</b> stamping, kicking or tripping players, illegal tackles and contact with players after they have kicked the ball. Dangerous play at line-outs is pushing, charging, obstructing or levering on an opponent. Dangerous play at scrums is charging at opponents not correctly binding to opponents, the hooker swinging (using both feet to strike the ball), twisting, dipping or lifting an opponent collapsing. Other offences that result in penalties are if a team has too many players, wearing illegal clothing, throwing the ball deliberately into touch, intentionally knocking the ball on, not releasing the ball if taking into touch, incorrect numbers in a scrum, handing in the scrum and the scrumhalf kicking {{the ball in the}} scrum.|$|E
25|$|The {{similarities}} between Tot and Webern's music <b>are</b> <b>striking.</b> In an often programmatic or cinematic fashion Webern ordered his published movements, themselves dramatic or visual tableaux with melodies that frequently {{begin and end}} on weak beats or else settle into ostinati or the background. In them, tonality, useful for communicating direction and narrative in programmatic pieces, becomes more tenuous, fragmented, static, symbolic, and visual or spatial in function, thus mirroring the concerns and topics, explicit or implicit, of Webern's music and his selections for it from the poetry of Stefan George and later Georg Trakl. Webern's dynamics, orchestration, and timbre are given so as to produce a fragile, intimate, and often novel sound, despite distinctly recalling Mahler, not infrequently bordering on silence at a typical ppp. In some cases, Webern's choice of instrument in particular functions to represent or to allude to a female voice (e.g., the use of solo violin), to inward or outward luminosity or darkness (e.g., {{the use of the}} entire range of register within the ensemble; registral compression and expansion; the use of celesta, harp, and glockenspiel; the use of harmonics and am steg directions), or to angels and heaven (e.g., the use of harp and trumpet in the circling ostinati of op. 6 no. 5 and winding to conclusion {{at the very end of}} op. 15 no. 5).|$|E

25|$|The {{portrait}} of Aline was painted in tempera on linen, as {{were those of}} the two girls. It has a height of 40cm and a width 32.5cm. Below the painted cloth, scraps of linen pressed onto the mummy's face were used to provide an even surface, so that the portrait is nearly flat. Some of the portraits were painted before {{the death of their}} subject, but in Aline's case, where it is actually painted {{on the end of the}} mummy wrapping, it appears to have been produced after death, perhaps based on a previously prepared portrait. As is common for mummy portraits, the painting produces the impression of three-dimensional depth, a relatively recent feature in Egyptian art and due to Graeco-Roman influences. Frontal depictions of human faces had also been unusual throughout most of the history of Egyptian art. The wavy hairstyle with a central parting is painted simply, but carefully. The small ringlets above the forehead <b>are</b> <b>striking.</b> The face appears full, but not fat. It conveys the impression that this woman, who belonged to the middle or upper levels of Egyptian society, had led a good life. Her simple jewellery is carefully painted. The depiction of the necklace made of gilded plaster, added to the portrait. Aline wears a white tunica or chiton, thin lilac bands (clavus) run across her shoulder. The colours are warm. The sad, wistful gaze is typical of mummy portraits. Altogether, it is a masterful {{portrait of}} a middle-aged woman.|$|E
500|$|The lobby has dim {{lighting}} {{that gives}} it a somewhat subdued quality, although the appliques of the lamps <b>are</b> <b>striking</b> and iconic. Both factors create an intimate atmosphere and highlight the place. Vertical bars of fluorescent light are covered with Belgian blue marble and Mexican amber onyx, which extinguishes and diffuses the light with a soft shine that both illuminates and fuses with the red marble walls.

500|$|When {{compared}} to the common Eurasian models {{of the development of}} civilization, Norte Chico's differences <b>are</b> <b>striking.</b> A total lack of ceramics persists across the period. The BBC observes that Norte Chico's people would have roasted their various crops, with no pots to boil them. The lack of pottery was accompanied by a lack of archaeologically apparent art. In conversation with Mann, Alvaro Ruiz observes: [...] "In the Norte Chico we see almost no visual arts. No sculpture, no carving or bas-relief, almost no painting or drawing—the interiors are completely bare. What we do see are these huge mounds—and textiles." ...|$|E
500|$|During the mid 20th-century, Virginia Radley states, [...] "the 'Eolian Harp' {{itself can}} be read with {{pleasure}} without a redaction of the poem for meaning.

The images and the personalities <b>are</b> <b>striking</b> enough to deserve approval from a purely belletristic standpoint. But the poem has meaning also." [...] Following this, M. H. Abrams declared {{that the idea of}} the [...] "One Life" [...] within The Eolian Harp, [...] "best epitomize the Romantic constellation of joy, love, and the shared life".|$|E
500|$|Nan Enstad, {{author of}} Ladies of Labor, Girls of Adventure: Working Women, Popular Culture, and Labor Politics at the Turn of the Twentieth Century {{says that the}} film relied on the dime novel formula {{as much as the}} labor-capital {{conventions}} to depict its story. Kay Sloan, author of The Loud Silents: Origins of the Social Problem Film, confirms that the simplified plot of the film is of the dime novel order. Barbara Antoniazzi, author of The Wayward Woman: Progressivism, Prostitution, and Performance in the United States, 1888–1917, highlights that the girls <b>are</b> <b>striking</b> against the actions of Connor instead of the owner and that Lou is portrayed as attractive, defiant and virtuous.

500|$|The 2008 American {{young adult}} novel The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins {{has been accused}} of being strikingly similar to Battle Royale in terms of the basic plot premise. While Collins {{maintains}} that she [...] "had never heard of that book until her book was turned in", Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that [...] "the parallels <b>are</b> <b>striking</b> enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff," [...] but argued that [...] "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently." [...] The general consensus in the time since has been one of amicable controversy, especially since the release of The Hunger Games film adaptation.

500|$|Similarities of The Hunger Games to Koushun Takami's 1999novel Battle Royale {{have been}} noted.

[...] Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that [...] "the parallels <b>are</b> <b>striking</b> enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff" [...] of Battle Royale but argued that [...] "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently." [...] Stephen King noted that the reality TV [...] "badlands" [...] were similar to Battle Royale, {{as well as his}} own novels The Running Man and The Long Walk. Eric Eisenberg wrote that The Hunger Games was [...] "not a rip off of Battle Royale, but simply a different usage of a similar idea", pointing out various differences in both story and themes.|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis from The Guardian lauded Shakira's originality, opining that [...] "In {{an age of}} personality-free pop idols, Shakira's glorious {{eccentricity}} {{makes her}} a true star," [...] and commented that [...] "Every song contains at least one non sequitur so eccentric {{that it could be}} the work of 1970s rock surrealist Captain Beefheart" [...] and [...] "The music on Laundry Service gives the lyrics a run for their money in the oddball handicap." [...] Although he felt that the use of samples on various songs [...] "displays an attitude to plagiarism that Noel Gallagher would consider cavalier" [...] and that [...] "no one could claim Laundry Service was a groundbreaking work of art," [...] he concluded that [...] "its ramshackle production and imponderable lyrics <b>are</b> <b>striking</b> and unique. And these days, it's hard not to find any pop record that provokes those adjectives rather cheering." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau termed Laundry Service [...] "the Cher album Cher never made" [...] and attributed this to Shakira's blend of Middle Eastern styles in her music; he commented that the [...] "stylistic appetite of this Colombian superstar is pure rock en Español" [...] and appreciated Shakira's confident songwriting. Christgau also noted Shakira's strong vibrato and constant changing of timbre in her vocals. Lisa Oliver from Yahoo! Music said that Shakira's experimentation with different styles yield [...] "results ranging from corking to minging," [...] but experienced difficulty with the formatting of the CD, saying [...] "the biggest problem with 'Laundry Service' is the anti-copying device that renders the CD useless in anything other than a conventional CD player [...] A shame then, because this Latino hottie could dilate the musical pupils of even the most ardent homebody if only they could get off the computer long enough to hear it." ...|$|E
