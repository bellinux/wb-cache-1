5|$|A fourth reason {{concerns}} students {{rather than}} researchers: Gonzalez Galli <b>argues</b> that since people naturally imagine that evolution has a purpose or direction, then {{the use of}} teleological language by scientists may act {{as an obstacle to}} students when learning about natural selection. Such language, he <b>argues,</b> should be removed to make teaching more effective.|$|E

5|$|All {{the above}} items show the 'contrivances' in existence, which Paley <b>argues</b> prove the {{personality}} of the Deity, arguing that only persons can contrive or design.|$|E
5|$|Arias-Maldonado <b>argues</b> that {{traditional}} {{appeals to the}} value of nonhuman animals have failed to be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He <b>argues</b> that once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a caring and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado <b>argues,</b> a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E
5|$|Carroll <b>argues</b> {{that many}} animals have a modular design with {{repeated}} parts, as in trilobites with repeated segments, or the repeated fingers {{of a human}} hand.|$|E

5|$|Chomsky <b>argues</b> {{that the}} multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating {{a form of}} participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy. As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky <b>argues,</b> they should approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they must come and listen {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he <b>argues,</b> these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E
5|$|Dava Sobel <b>argues</b> {{that prior}} to Galileo's 1633 trial and {{judgement}} for heresy, Pope Urban VIII had become preoccupied with court intrigue and problems of state, and began to fear persecution or threats to his own life. In this context, Sobel <b>argues</b> {{that the problem of}} Galileo was presented to the pope by court insiders and enemies of Galileo. Having been accused of weakness in defending the church, Urban reacted against Galileo out of anger and fear.|$|E
5|$|Despite their idiomatic differences, Raymond McKenzie <b>argues</b> {{that the}} works of both Ian Hamilton Finlay and Stoddart combine formal and {{intellectual}} elegance with sharp, sometimes satirical critiques of contemporary society.|$|E

5|$|From {{this model}} of Kantian ethics, O'Neill begins to develop a theory of justice. She <b>argues</b> that the {{rejection}} of certain principles, such as deception and coercion, provides {{a starting point for}} basic conceptions of justice, which she <b>argues</b> are more determinate for human beings that the more abstract principles of equality or liberty. Nevertheless, she concedes that these principles may seem to be excessively demanding: there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non-universalisable principles, such as injury.|$|E
5|$|Hadley has {{considered}} {{the ethics of}} humans' relationships with wild animals and environments beyond his property rights theory. He <b>argues</b> {{that there is a}} duty to aid wild animals in need, and that these duties are essentially no different to humans' duties to aid distant strangers who are severely cognitively impaired. He <b>argues</b> that libertarian property rights, consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean proviso, should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments.|$|E
5|$|Hiltebeitel <b>argues</b> {{that the}} Kuttantavar cult might {{represent}} the original Tamil tradition regarding Aravan, {{however it is}} no longer the only tradition that venerates Aravan. The Draupadi cult has developed traditions and rituals of its own.|$|E

Knight, and Johnson, Clapp, & Underwood <b>argued</b> for the plaintiff in Nos. 667, 668, 669. Solicitor General Hoyt, Attorney General Bonaparte, and Mr. Otis J. Carlton <b>argued</b> for the defendant.|$|R
50|$|According to Ayer when we <b>argue</b> {{about whether}} a value-judgment is right or wrong, we are really <b>arguing</b> about the {{empirical}} facts on which a value-judgment is based, or about the logical interpretation of empirical facts. We cannot <b>argue</b> about something that cannot be expressed as a proposition. We can only <b>argue</b> about {{something that can be}} analytically or empirically verified.|$|R

5|$|James Lewis <b>argues</b> that {{scientific}} themes are so prevalent in The Satanic Bible because LaVey was {{appealing to the}} authority of science to legitimize Satanism as a religion.|$|E
5|$|James Morris {{notes that}} Hick's eschatological {{verification}} {{theory has been}} criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in religious pluralism. Morris <b>argues</b> that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He <b>argues</b> that even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in bodily resurrection can still be verified.|$|E
50|$|The Court heard oral {{argument}} in the case on December 4, 2007 where the petitioner Michael Newdow <b>argued</b> for plaintiffs.

50|$|Denis Downey, who had {{represented}} the plaintiffs {{from the district}} court onwards, <b>argued</b> for them. Theodore Krebsbach, who had <b>argued</b> McMahon before the Court, <b>argued</b> again for Shearson. Downey was permitted a short time for rebuttal after Krebsbach finished.|$|R

50|$|For the appeal, Professor Alan Dershowitz <b>argued</b> for Shirley Shawe, a 1% {{owner in}} the company. Dershowitz <b>argued</b> that Chancellor Bouchard's {{decision}} was tantamount to an illegal constitutional taking.

The appeal affirmed Bouchard's decision.|$|R
