The delivery of CBT has been limited by a scarcity of resources and further limited by the inequitable geographic distribution of CBT therapists. Aims: The current study replicates and extends our previous analysis of the geography of British Association of Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies (BABCP) membership (Shapiro, Cavanagh and Lomas, 2003) 10 years later in order to evaluate the progress made in improving equitable access to CBT. Method: This paper presents the absolute and comparative geographic distribution of current BABCP members, accredited CBT practitioners, and BABCP members who are nurses or clinical psychologists in England and Wales. Results: Efforts to improve the availability of CBT in England and Wales {{are reflected in the}} doubling of total membership, and a 4. 5 fold increase in accredited membership over the last 10 years.

40|$|In this paper, after a {{critical}} review of the literature, we present two forward solvers and a new methodology for description of photon migration {{in the presence of}} totally absorbing inclusions embedded in diffusive media in both time and CW domains. The first forward solver is a heuristic approach based on a higher order perturbation theory applied to the diffusion equation (DE) [denoted eighth-order perturbation theory (EOPT) ]. The second forward solver [denoted eighth-order perturbation theory with the equivalence relation (EOPTER) ] is obtained by combining the EOPT solver with the adoption of the equivalence relation (ER) [J. Biomed. Opt. 18, 066014 (2013) ]. These forward solvers can possibly overcome some <b>evident</b> <b>limitations</b> of previous approaches like the theory behind the so-called banana-shape regions or exact analytical solutions of the DE in the presence of highly or totally absorbing inclusions. We also propose the ER to reformulate the problem of a totally absorbing inclusion in terms of another inclusion having a finite absorption contrast and a re-scaled volume. For instance, we have shown how this approach can indeed be used to simulate black inclusions with the Born approximation. By means of comparisons with the results of Monte Carlo simulations, we have shown that the EOPTER solver can model totally absorbing inclusions with an error smaller than about 10 %, whereas the EOPT solver shows an error smaller than about 20 %, showing a performance largely better than that observed with solvers proposed previously...|$|R

The production of innovative drugs experiences a dramatic fall since twenty years and we do not have any reliable basic principles to cope with complex problems on ecological scale. Moreover, the completion of human genome enterprise definitively falsified the premises from which that project was born: the so called molecular biology central dogma is untenable and, far to be the key to the unravelling of life mysteries, the genome project was a big lesson of humility for all of us. Given these premises, an increasing number of scientists all over the world is involved in a deep re-thinking of the very bases of our scientific knowledge. This re-thinking has many facets, here I would like to discuss about an evident pathology of science with respect to other human activities: its increasing self-referential character that poses strong constraints to its innovative power. Basically only scientists of a specific field can judge about the merit of the work of other scientists of the same (or very related) fields.

40|$|The <b>evident</b> <b>limitations</b> of the amyloid {{theory of}} the {{pathogenesis}} of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease are increasingly putting alternatives in the spotlight. We argue here {{that a number of}} independently developing approaches to therapy-including specific and nonspecific anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, apolipoprotein E mimetics, leptin, intranasal insulin, the glucagon-like peptide- 1 mimetics and glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK- 3) antagonists-are all part of an interlocking chain of events. All these approaches inform us that inflammation and thence cerebral insulin resistance constitute the pathway on which to focus for a successful clinical outcome in treating this disease. The key link in this chain presently absent is a recognition by Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s research community of the long-neglected history of TNF induction of insulin resistance. When this is incorporated into the bigger picture, it becomes evident that the interventions we discuss are not competing alternatives but equally valid approaches to correcting different parts of the same pathway to Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease. These treatments can be expected to be at least additive, and conceivably synergistic, in effect. Thus the inflammation, insulin resistance, GSK- 3, and mitochondrial dysfunction hypotheses are not opposing ideas but stages of the same fundamental, overarching, pathway of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease pathogenesis. The insight this provides into progenitor cells, including those involved in adult neurogenesis, is a key part of this approach.
