5|$|Frogs such as Physalaemus nattereri, Physalaemus deimaticus, and Pleurodema brachyops have {{a warning}} display behaviour. These animals inflate {{themselves}} with air {{and raise their}} hind parts to appear as large as possible, and display brightly coloured markings and eyespots to intimidate predators. Seven species of frogs in the genus Pleurodema have lumbar glands (making the animals distasteful, so in their case the display is likely aposematic); these glands are usually boldly contrasted in black <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>further</b> warning.|$|E

5|$|He criticised the {{hypocrisy}} of chastity for women and argued that it should also either belong to men, {{or not at all}} for both individuals. While fighting against this, Periyar advocated {{to get rid of the}} Devadasi system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>further</b> liberation of women, Periyar pushed for the right of women to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his Irish influences, Bax also drew on a Nordic tradition, being inspired by the Norwegian poet Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Icelandic sagas. Bax's Symphonic Variations for Piano and Orchestra (1917) is seen by the musicologist Julian Herbage as the turning-point from the Celtic to the Nordic in Bax's oeuvre; Herbage views it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>further</b> indication of the shift that Winter Legends, composed thirteen years later, has a Nordic rather than a Celtic setting.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1902, Beebe {{was married}} to Mary Blair Rice, better known by her pen name Blair Niles.

The court was full shortly after the doors were opened at 9:00am, and a large crowd gathered outside Parliament House; 300 constables were on duty to prevent disturbances, while infantry and cavalry were on standby <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>further</b> precaution.|$|E
5|$|While {{reduction}} of sodium intake {{to less than}} 2,300mg per day is recommended by developed countries, one review recommended that sodium intake be reduced to at least 1,200mg (contained in 3g of salt) per day, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>further</b> reduction in salt intake the greater the fall in systolic blood pressure for all age groups and ethinicities.

5|$|As {{a reward}} for his service, Warenne was given custody {{of a number of}} lands confiscated from Prince John, {{including}} the Honour of Gloucester, which Warenne administered for the royal government from 1194 to 1196 during the captivity of King Richard I. He also received <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>further</b> mark of royal favour the wardships of various minor heirs. In 1194 Warenne was given custody of the heir of Hugh de Chandos, in return for which he gave the king 40 marks. Warenne's career was closely tied to Hubert Walter's, who promoted his career as a justice. Besides his royal service, Walter employed Warenne as a justice on ecclesiastical matters and sent him in 1194 to York to deal with complaints by the cathedral chapter of York Minster against their archbishop, Geoffrey. A sign of further ties between the two was that Warenne served as a witness on Walter's charters founding a monastery at West Dereham.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time the attack on the city would mark {{the first time that the}} revolutionary army would confront federal forces in a regular battle rather than relying on guerrilla tactics. While the fusion of Madero's, Villa's and Orozco's men did result in a number of troops {{sufficient}} to form a force capable of fighting professional soldiers in pitched encounters, the federal troops still had the advantage in terms of training and discipline. The government, in fact, had a good chance of squashing the rebels by moving troops down from the state capital of Ciudad Chihuahua and capturing Madero in a pincer movement. However, the Díaz-appointed governor of the state, Miguel Ahumada, was worried that if the soldiers abandoned the capital unrest would break out and the insurrection would spread. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>further</b> sign of the apparent demoralization of federal rank-and-file soldiers (many of whom had been forcibly conscripted and actually sympathized with the revolutionaries), the troops in Ciudad Chihuahua decided to stay put.|$|E
5|$|Borchgrevink was not {{a trained}} scientist, and his {{incompetence}} with equipment and inability to make simple observations were reportedly of great concern {{to some of the}} party. However, a programme of scientific observations was maintained, exercise was taken outside the hut when the weather permitted, and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>further</b> diversion Savio improvised a sauna in the snowdrifts alongside the hut. A concert was arranged, including lantern slides, songs and readings. During this time there were two near-fatal incidents; in the first, a candle left burning beside a bunk set fire to the hut and caused extensive damage. In the second, three of the party were nearly asphyxiated by coal fire fumes as they slept.|$|E

5|$|Gilbertian mimicry {{occurs in}} the genus Passiflora. The leaves of this plant contain toxins that deter herbivorous animals. However, some Heliconius {{butterfly}} larvae have evolved enzymes that break down these toxins, allowing them to specialize on this genus. This has created further selection pressure on the host plants, which have evolved stipules that mimic mature Heliconius eggs near the point of hatching. These butterflies tend to avoid laying eggs near existing ones, which helps avoid exploitative intraspecific competition between caterpillars — those that lay on vacant leaves provide their offspring with a greater chance of survival. Most Heliconius larvae are cannibalistic, meaning that on leaves older eggs hatch first and eat the new arrivals. Thus, it seems that such plants have evolved egg dummies under selection pressure from these grazing herbivore enemies. In addition, the decoy eggs are also nectaries, attracting predators of the caterpillars such as ants and wasps <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>further</b> defence.|$|E
5|$|The Northrop F-20 Tigershark (initially F-5G) was {{a privately}} financed light fighter, {{designed}} and built by Northrop. Its development began in 1975 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>further</b> evolution of Northrop's F-5E Tiger II, featuring a new engine that greatly improved overall performance, and a modern avionics suite including a powerful and flexible radar. Compared with the F-5E, the F-20 was much faster, gained beyond-visual-range air-to-air capability, and had a full suite of air-to-ground modes capable of firing most U.S. weapons. With these improved capabilities, the F-20 became competitive with contemporary fighter designs such as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, but was much less expensive to purchase and operate.|$|E

5|$|The {{council was}} first called on 11 October 1147 by Eugene, who ordered the bishops and others {{summoned to the}} council to {{assemble}} at Trier on 21 March 1148. This is from a letter sent to Henry Zdík, the Bishop of Olmuetz by the pope. However, a letter sent by the pope on the next day, 12 October 1147, to Eberhard, the Archbishop of Salzburg, named Troyes as the location for the council. It is likely that Troyes, however, was a scribal error, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>further</b> letter of Eugene's, to Suger, Abbot of St Denis, dated 6 October 1147, named Trier as the location also, thus confirming the location given in the letter of 11 October.|$|E
5|$|This {{desertion}} further discouraged Bardanes, and, {{reluctant to}} face the loyalist army in battle, he opted for a negotiated surrender through the mediation of Joseph, the hegumenos of the Kathara monastery who had officiated at Constantine VI's second marriage. Bardanes received a letter signed by the Patriarch Tarasios and several leading senators which guaranteed that {{neither he nor his}} subordinates would be punished if they surrendered. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>further</b> guarantee of good faith, Nikephoros sent his own gold cross along with the letter. Satisfied by these assurances, on 8 September Bardanes left his army and, through Nicaea, sought refuge in the monastery of Herakleios at Cius. From there, he embarked on a ship that took him to the island of Prote. Taking the monastic name Sabbas, Bardanes then entered a monastery that he had founded there in the past.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Slade, the Surveyor of the Navy {{and former}} Master Shipwright at Deptford Dockyard, was the {{designer}} of the Venus-class of 36-gun frigates. Alongside their smaller cousin, the 32-gun Southampton class, the Venus-class represented an experiment in ship design; fast, medium-sized and heavily-armed, capable of overhauling smaller craft and single-handedly engaging enemy cruisers or large privateers. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>further</b> innovation, Slade borrowed from contemporary French ship design by removing the lower deck gun ports and locating the ship's cannons solely on the upper deck. This permitted the carrying of heavier ordinance without the substantial increase in hull size {{that would have been}} required to keep the lower gun ports consistently above the waterline. The lower deck carried additional stores, enabling Venus-class frigates to remain at sea for longer periods without resupply.|$|E
