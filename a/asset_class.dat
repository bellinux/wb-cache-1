5|$|Roughly speaking, the {{approach}} of building a risk parity portfolio is similar to creating a minimum-variance portfolio subject to the constraint that each asset (or <b>asset</b> <b>class,</b> such as bonds, stocks, real estate, etc.) contributes equally to the portfolio overall volatility.|$|E
5|$|Beginning roughly in 1992, {{three years}} after the RJR Nabisco buyout, and {{continuing}} {{through the end of the}} decade the private equity industry once again experienced a tremendous boom, both in venture capital (as will be discussed below) and leveraged buyouts with the emergence of brand name firms managing multibillion-dollar sized funds. After declining from 1990 through 1992, the private equity industry began to increase in size raising approximately $20.8 billion of investor commitments in 1992 and reaching a high-water mark in 2000 of $305.7 billion, outpacing the growth of almost every other <b>asset</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{exemption}} laws {{vary greatly}} {{from state to}} state. In some states, exempt property includes equity in a home or car, tools of the trade, and some personal effects.

40|$|This {{study was}} driven by the {{dissimilar}} performance characteristics displayed by <b>asset</b> <b>classes</b> over the business cycle. The authors aim to explore <b>assets</b> <b>classes</b> {{on the grounds of}} a scientific literature review and a statistical analysis. Business cycles are divided into four stages to explore broad movements in returns of <b>asset</b> <b>classes</b> and a possible existence of asymmetrical effects of determinants within stages. Six main <b>asset</b> <b>classes</b> were analysed: US stocks, EAFE stocks, Bonds, Gold, Real Estate and Commodities. Monthly data from February 1976 to August 2011 were used for the study. The article combines business cycle and asset allocation theories by adding valuable information about performance of <b>asset</b> <b>classes</b> during different phases of the business cycle. Using the OECD Composite Leading Indicator as a business cycle measure, the authors demonstrate that different <b>assets</b> <b>classes</b> have different return/risk characteristics over the business cycle. The article demonstrates how to use the business cycle approach for investment decision-making. The OECD Composite Leading Indicator can provide significant information on market expectations and the future outlook; hence, results of this study can help every investor improve his/her performance and risk management...|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{portfolio}} diversification {{relies on the}} correlations among assets and among <b>asset</b> <b>classes,</b> but these correlations are not constant. Because correlations among <b>assets</b> and <b>asset</b> <b>classes</b> increase during tail risk events and can go to 100%, TRP divides <b>asset</b> <b>classes</b> into buckets that behave differently under market stress conditions, while assets in each bucket behave similarly. During tail risk events asset prices can fall significantly creating deep portfolio drawdowns. <b>Asset</b> <b>classes</b> in each tail risk bucket fall simultaneously during tail risk events and diversification of capital within buckets does not work because periods of negative performance of portfolio components are overlapped. Diversification across tail risk buckets can provide benefits {{in the form of}} smaller portfolio drawdowns and reduce the need for tail risk protection.|$|R
40|$|Between 2002 {{and early}} 2005 risk premia {{for a number}} of <b>asset</b> <b>classes</b> across broad {{geographical}} areas not only fell substantially but also tended to move more closely together than they had done historically. This raises the question to what extent this apparent reduced investor discrimination across <b>asset</b> <b>classes</b> went beyond what can be accounted for by market-specific developments. In particular, the reduced discrimination among <b>asset</b> <b>classes</b> could suggest that factors other than market- or country-specific events {{have played a role in}} narrowing risk premia. ...|$|R
25|$|Commentators {{have argued}} that a {{standard}} methodology is needed to present an accurate picture of performance, to make individual private equity funds comparable and so the <b>asset</b> <b>class</b> as a whole can be matched against public markets {{and other types of}} investment. It is also claimed that PE fund managers manipulate data to present themselves as strong performers, which makes it even more essential to standardize the industry.|$|E
25|$|Foreign {{exchange}} trading increased by 20% between April 2007 and April 2010, {{and has more}} than doubled since 2004. The increase in turnover is due to a number of factors: the growing importance of foreign exchange as an <b>asset</b> <b>class,</b> the increased trading activity of high-frequency traders, and the emergence of retail investors as an important market segment. The growth of electronic execution and the diverse selection of execution venues has lowered transaction costs, increased market liquidity, and attracted greater participation from many customer types. In particular, electronic trading via online portals has made it easier for retail traders to trade in the foreign exchange market. By 2010, retail trading was estimated to account for up to 10% of spot turnover, or $150 billion per day (see below: Retail foreign exchange traders).|$|E
25|$|Though {{real estate}} is still his most {{preferred}} <b>asset</b> <b>class,</b> Trump became an active financial market investor in 2011 following disappointment from depressed American real estate market and various investments in the Federal Reserve's interest yields on CDs were next to nothing. Trump stated {{that he was not}} enthusiastic to be a stock market investor, but that prime real estate at good prices was hard to find at that time and that stocks and equity securities were cheap and generating good cash flow from dividends. He profited from 40 of the 45 stocks he purchased which he sold in 2014, making it almost a 90% success rate in capital appreciation in addition to millions in earned dividends. The biggest gainers in his stock portfolio were Bank of America Corporation, The Boeing Company and Facebook, Inc earning a windfall profit of $6.7 million, $3.96 million and $3.85 million, respectively.|$|E

25|$|The {{investment}} {{strategies of}} private equity firms differ {{to those of}} hedge funds. Typically, private equity investment groups are geared towards long-hold, multiple-year investment strategies in illiquid assets (whole companies, large-scale real estate projects, or other tangibles not easily converted to cash) where they have more control and influence over operations or asset management to influence their long-term returns. Hedge funds usually focus on short or medium term liquid securities which are more quickly convertible to cash, {{and they do not}} have direct control over the business or asset in which they are investing. Both private equity firms and hedge funds often specialize in specific types of investments and transactions. Private equity specialization is usually in specific industry sector asset management while hedge fund specialization is in industry sector risk capital management. Private equity strategies can include wholesale purchase of a privately held company or set of assets, mezzanine financing for start-up projects, growth capital investments in existing businesses or leveraged buyout of a publicly held asset converting it to private control. Finally, private equity firms only take long positions, for short selling is not possible in this <b>asset</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E
