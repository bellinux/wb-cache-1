5|$|Endometrial cancer forms {{when there}} are errors in normal endometrial cell growth. Usually, when cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Cancer starts when new cells form unneeded, and old or damaged cells do not die <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>should.</b> The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor. These {{abnormal}} cancer cells have many genetic abnormalities that cause them to grow excessively.|$|E
5|$|The New York Times {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq. On May 26, 2004, {{a year after}} the war started, the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> have been, and were insufficiently qualified, frequently overly dependent upon information from Iraqi exiles desiring regime change. Reporter Judith Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead-up to the Iraq War was factually inaccurate and overly favorable to the Bush administration's position, for which The New York Times later apologized. One of Miller's prime sources was Ahmed Chalabi, an Iraqi expatriate who returned to Iraq after the U.S. invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Logan is {{informed}} that Ichirō has died. At the funeral, Yakuza gangsters attempt to kidnap Mariko, but Logan and Mariko escape together into the urban sprawl of Tokyo. Logan is shot and his wounds do not heal as quickly <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>should.</b> After fighting off more Yakuza on a bullet train, Logan and Mariko hide {{in a local}} love hotel. Meanwhile, Ichirō's bodyguard Harada meets with Dr. Green who, after demonstrating her mutant powers on him, demands he find Logan and Mariko. Logan and Mariko travel to Ichirō's house in Nagasaki, and the two slowly fall in love. Meanwhile, Yukio has a vision of Logan dying, and goes to warn him. Before Yukio arrives, Mariko is captured by the Yakuza. After interrogating one of the kidnappers, Logan and Yukio confront Mariko's fiancé, corrupt Minister of Justice Noburo Mori. Mori confesses that he conspired with Shingen to have Mariko killed because Ichirō left {{control of the company}} to Mariko, and not Shingen.|$|E

5|$|Villermé {{published}} Des prisons telles qu'elles sont et telles qu'elles devraient être (On Prisons as They Are and <b>as</b> <b>They</b> <b>Should</b> Be) in 1820. In {{this work}} he {{called attention to}} the unhealthy conditions of the prisons in Paris. He outlined several components of the prison systems that he believed should be abolished including torture, ill treatment, cells, and unequal treatment of prisoners based on the amount of money men are able to give up. Villermé urged the government of Paris to take after the newly reformed prison systems of the United States and Russia. His goal was to persuade officials to reevaluate the unhealthy living environments and treatments of men in prisons so that men are able to become functioning citizens upon their release. This work in particular reflects the multifaceted approach Villermé took in his research, combining knowledge of medicine, data analysis, and social epidemiology.|$|E

5000|$|A second {{experiment}} involving VP {{attempted to}} investigate what aspects of words transferred {{between the two}} hemispheres. The set up {{was similar to the}} previous experiment, with VP's vision fixated on a central cross hair. A word pair was presented with one word {{on each side of the}} cross-hair for 150 ms. The words presented were in one of four categories: words that looked and sounded like rhymes (e.g. tire and fire), words that looked <b>as</b> if <b>they</b> <b>should</b> rhyme but did not (e.g. cough and dough), words that did not look <b>as</b> if <b>they</b> <b>should</b> rhyme but did (e.g. bake and ache), and words that neither looked nor sounded like rhymes (e.g. keys and fort). After presentation of each word pair, VP responded [...] "yes" [...] if the two words rhymed and [...] "no" [...] if they did not. VP's performance was above chance and she was able to distinguish among the different conditions. When the word pairs did not sound like rhymes, VP was able to say accurately that the words did not rhyme, regardless of whether or not <b>they</b> looked <b>as</b> if <b>they</b> <b>should</b> rhyme. When the words did rhyme, VP was more likely to say they rhymed, particularly if the words also looked <b>as</b> if <b>they</b> <b>should</b> rhyme.|$|R

25|$|Alcohol {{has been}} known to {{mitigate}} the production of antidiuretic hormone, which is a hormone that acts on the kidney to favour water reabsorption in the kidneys during filtration. This occurs because alcohol confuses osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which relay osmotic pressure information to the posterior pituitary, the site of antidiuretic hormone release. Alcohol causes the osmoreceptors to signal that there is low osmotic pressure in the blood, which triggers an inhibition of the antidiuretic hormone. As a consequence, one's kidneys are no longer able to reabsorb as much water <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be absorbing, leading to creation of excessive volumes of urine and the subsequent overall dehydration.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a small}} quirk in this {{alternating}} pattern when Edward VIII became king in January 1936 and was portrayed facing left, the same as his predecessor George V. This was because Edward thought his left to be his best side. However, Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936 and his coins were never put into general circulation. When George VI came to the throne, he had his coins struck with him facing the left, as if Edward VIII's coins had faced right (<b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> have done according to tradition). Thus, in a timeline of circulating British coins, George V and VI's coins both feature left-facing portraits, although they follow directly chronologically.|$|E

Continuous ovulation {{for a long time}} means more repair of the ovary by dividing cells, which can acquire mutations in each division.|$|E

25|$|Information {{stored in}} high-dynamic-range images {{typically}} {{corresponds to the}} physical values of luminance or radiance that {{can be observed in}} the real world. This is different from traditional digital images, which represent colors <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> appear on a monitor or a paper print. Therefore, HDR image formats are often called scene-referred, in contrast to traditional digital images, which are device-referred or output-referred. Furthermore, traditional images are usually encoded for the human visual system (maximizing the visual information stored in the fixed number of bits), which is usually called gamma encoding or gamma correction. The values stored for HDR images are often gamma compressed (power law) or logarithmically encoded, or floating-point linear values, since fixed-point linear encodings are increasingly inefficient over higher dynamic ranges.|$|E

The next year he called for more land for the city to accommodate growth and in hopes of adding a university to the area during his State of the City address. Later that year he and other county leaders expressed dismay at Metro, the regional government, concerning the purchase of open spaces in the county using bond money approved by regional voters. Hughes complained that the county and city were not receiving as much land <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> based on the tax amounts. On May 29, 2003, he suffered a mild heart attack and had minor heart surgery at Providence St. Vincent Medical Center to undergo angioplasty and install a stent.|$|E
25|$|During 1968, Collins {{noticed that}} his legs were not working <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>should,</b> first during {{handball}} games, then as he walked down stairs, his knee would almost give way. His left leg also had unusual sensations when in hot and cold water. Reluctantly he sought medical advice and the diagnosis was a cervical disc herniation, requiring two vertebrae to be fused together. The surgery was performed at Wilford Hall Hospital at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, and he spent three months in a neck brace. It also removed Collins from the crew of Apollo 9 and moved Jim Lovell up to the prime crew. When the Apollo 8 mission was changed from a CSM/LM in Earth orbit, to a CSM-only flight around the Moon, both prime and backup crews for the Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 swapped places.|$|E

25|$|During his tenure, {{the major}} issues facing state {{government}} were related to secondary education and highway construction. With {{the passage of the}} controversial School Codes of 1919 and 1921 Delaware was committed to an aggressive program of school construction. Pierre S. du Pont had agreed to get the process started and provided the massive financial support from his own funds. However, that could not continue forever and yet the General Assembly refused to levy additional taxes. Fortunately the new income tax and corporate franchise tax were capable of producing the revenue needed, but it was suspected everyone was not filing <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> have been. To remedy the situation Robinson appointed du Pont himself to be the State Tax Commissioner. Du Pont quickly modernized the office, increased the revenue from the income tax and assured the continuation of the school building program.|$|E
