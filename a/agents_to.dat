5|$|In 1914, the US Department of Agriculture {{began to}} fund {{cooperative}} extension services through the land grant college of each state, and Cornell expanded its impact by sending <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> spread knowledge in each county of New York State. Although Syracuse had started awarding forestry degrees at this point, Cornell's extension agents covered all of home economics and agriculture, including forestry.|$|E
5|$|Phips and Increase Mather were odd-fellows, {{without much}} in common, {{but they had}} become {{politically}} conjoined to the new charter, {{and it would be}} their job to sell it to the people of Massachusetts who were expecting their <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> return with nothing less than the old charter restored.|$|E
5|$|Some brewers add {{one or more}} {{clarifying}} <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> beer, {{which typically}} precipitate (collect as a solid) out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product. This process makes the beer appear bright and clean, rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers.|$|E
30|$|The main {{function}} of this <b>agent</b> is <b>to</b> manage the communication between all {{components of the}} system, and control the data transmission among them. It is responsible for transferring the user needs from the user interface <b>agent</b> <b>to</b> MR-agent, QM-agent and DS-agent and sending back the result <b>to</b> the control <b>agent</b> <b>to</b> save it in the knowledge base. Once the result is saved in the knowledge base, the control <b>agent,</b> transfer it <b>to</b> the principal <b>agent</b> <b>to</b> begin the evaluation task of extracted rules.|$|R

40|$|At {{least three}} types of precautionary motives are {{directly}} relevant <b>to</b> an <b>agent's</b> demand for assets. (I.) The precautionary saving motive, or prudence, can cause an <b>agent</b> <b>to</b> respond to a risk by accumulating more wealth. (II.) The desire to moderate total exposure to risk, or temperance, can cause an <b>agent</b> <b>to</b> respond to an unavoidable risk by reducing exposure to other risks even when the other risks are statistically independent of the first. (III.) The precautionary demand for liquidity can cause an <b>agent</b> <b>to</b> respond to a risk by holding more money. ...|$|R
5|$|The Abwehr {{was right}} {{to worry about the}} {{presence}} of British double agents within their secret service. They were at that time already running 'Garbo' (Juan Pujol), 'Zig-Zag' (Eddie Chapman) and 'Tricycle' (Du≈°an Popov), supposedly German <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> whom they were paying large sums of money, but who were in reality working for the British and were supplying the Germans with false information.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} Indians allied to the British {{witnessed}} the debacle first hand complicated future relations with them.

5|$|All NIU Huskie {{sporting}} events, {{home and}} away, through Sunday were canceled. Most students left campus for the weekend. A {{spokesman for the}} ATF stated that agents were dispatched to the scene to assist and to help trace the weapons used. The FBI also sent <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> assist. According to police, Steven Kazmierczak removed the hard drive from his laptop computer and a computer chip from his cell phone and did not leave a note that could help explain why he chose a geology class on Valentine's Day to open fire. Investigators were expected {{to spend at least}} three more weeks until releasing a report on the incident.|$|E
50|$|Trinitrobenzene is used {{primarily}} as a high explosive for commercial mining and military use.

5|$|Defensive tackle Stephen Paea was {{the first}} of the Bears' free <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> leave the team, signing with the Redskins on March 10. Two days later, safety Chris Conte joined the Buccaneers. On April 9, cornerback Charles Tillman was signed by the Panthers. On May 13, 14 and 17, linebacker Darryl Sharpton, cornerback Danny McCray and {{receiver}} Josh Morgan departed the Bears to sign with the Cardinals, Cowboys and Saints, respectively.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} a {{classified}} S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, tensions among the agents are high due to poor communication during the fight. This concerns Reyes, who decides to double-cross Coulson and secure the 0-8-4 for her government. Together, the agents devise a plan to activate the weapon, blowing {{a hole in the}} Bus. The drop in pressure opens the interior doors, allowing the <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> subdue the soldiers. At the facility, Reyes and her men are incarcerated and the 0-8-4 is launched into the sun in a rocket. The team watch the launch together, celebrating their combined efforts, while Ward agrees to supervise Skye's S.H.I.E.L.D. training. Skye secretly confirms her allegiance to the hacktivist group the Rising Tide.|$|E
5|$|Hearing noise, Mulder heads {{outside and}} {{witnesses}} a UFO flying overhead; inside, small beings run past Scully. Cars full of armed soldiers arrive, forcing the <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> flee. The agents meet with Skinner at a diner in rural Maryland. Skinner wants {{to turn over}} the tape in exchange for their reinstatement and safety. After initially objecting, Mulder agrees to let Skinner turn the tape over. Skinner heads to see Melissa in the hospital and is told by Albert of the mysterious blue-suited man outside. Skinner chases the man to a stairwell where he is attacked by Alex Krycek and Luis Cardinal, who beat him unconscious and steal the tape.|$|E

5|$|In March 1892, the cattlemen sent <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> Texas from Cheyenne and Idaho {{to recruit}} gunmen and finally {{carry out their}} plans for exterminating the homesteaders. The cattle barons have always used hired guns from Texas to take out {{suspected}} rustlers and scare away the nesters in Wyoming. One particular act of violence perpetrated by the Texans was recounted by cowboy John J. Baker, where the Texans ambushed and killed nine trappers whom they mistook for rustlers in Big Dry Creek, Wyoming. They received a $450 bonus for the slaughter.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, the treason and {{defection}} of Dumouriez {{gave the}} Jacobins full scope {{to take control}} of the armies. Before Neerwinden, the army obeyed its commanders. Afterward, the representatives on mission were given extraordinary powers over army commanders. The generals might pay with their lives for defeat, but the real authority lay with the political operatives. Meanwhile, the new War Minister sent his <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> spy on the generals. These men were quick to report any complaint against officers, which could result in disgrace or execution. Elements of this system stayed in force even after Maximilien Robespierre was overthrown and guillotined.|$|E
5|$|Ironside {{began on}} 23 May 1944 {{with the aim}} of having the threat {{established}} by 29 May and continued until 28 June (22 days after the Normandy landings). It was implemented via double agents, in Britain and the United States, {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee. The operation did not receive any resources from the Allied navies or airforce, so the deception had no physical element. This meant that Ironside had none of the traditional accompaniments to an invasion, including reconnaissance flights, bombardment, and naval operations. As a result, the Twenty Committee was cautious about using important <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> pass over the deception.|$|E

50|$|To create foam latex, {{a liquid}} latex base {{is mixed with}} various {{additives}} and whipped into a foam, then poured or injected into a mold and baked in an oven to cure. The main components of foam latex are the latex base, a foaming <b>agent</b> (<b>to</b> help it whip into a froth), a gelling <b>agent</b> (<b>to</b> convert the liquid foam into a gel), and a curing <b>agent</b> (<b>to</b> turn the gelled foam latex into a solid when baked). A number of additional additives can also be added depending on the required use of the foam.|$|R

5|$|Krycek {{leads the}} <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> Dulles International Airport, where {{they try to}} {{apprehend}} a second courier carrying a diplomatic pouch from Russia. The courier leads the agents on a pursuit through the airport, but drops the pouch before escaping. The pouch is revealed to carry a seemingly unremarkable rock. Mulder has Krycek confined at the high rise apartment of Assistant Director Walter Skinner before having the rock analyzed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Dr. Sacks, a NASA scientist, tells Mulder and Scully that the rock is a prehistoric meteorite fragment that might contain fossilized alien bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Fringe {{division}} is falsely told that their Olivia has escaped. Agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), still needing hyperbaric treatment to regrow his skin after being burned, and Agent Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) follow a tracking device on Henry's taxi. When {{they arrive at}} the station, Olivia orders Henry to drive away, and manages to fire at a small valve on a gas tank, allowing the explosion to cover their trail. Walternate, watching the altercation on monitors, notes Olivia has gained the marksmanship ability that the alternate Olivia possesses, and begins to think the serum is working. Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes in a later conversation that the rush of adrenaline effectively enhanced the potency of his chemical <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> brainwash Olivia.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{travel to}} NASA and meet Belt, a {{childhood}} hero of Mulder's. Belt, who now manages the shuttle program, dismisses the agents' concerns and states {{that nothing can}} possibly go wrong with the mission. He allows the <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> watch the launch from Mission Control. The launch is successful. As the agents are leaving however, Generoo informs them that contact is lost with the shuttle in orbit. While driving back to Mission Control, Generoo sees the face come at her through her windshield, causing her to crash her car.|$|E

5|$|Mulder {{contacts}} Frohike and Byers, who {{say that}} Fairfield {{is known for its}} animal disappearances and UFO sightings. They also mention Ambrose's gorilla, who is known to communicate using American Sign Language. Meanwhile, Scully follows one of Lang's activists as he sneaks into the zoo, running into Meecham inside. The activist attempts to free a tiger, but after a flash of light, the tiger seemingly disappears. The activist is promptly mauled to death, with the killing captured on his night vision camera. When questioned, Lang denies any responsibility for the death. Ambrose introduces the <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> the gorilla, Sophie, who has been cowering in her cage and expresses an apparent fear of light.|$|E
5|$|Olivia rejoins Henry {{and then}} leaves him to swim {{the rest of}} the way in and make her way to the {{isolation}} tank. After injecting herself with the same drugs Walternate (John Noble) had used on her, she enters the tank and soon finds herself back in her own universe. She encounters a cleaning lady, and as Olivia feels herself being dragged back to the parallel universe, she gives the cleaning lady a message to pass along to Peter (Joshua Jackson). Back in the isolation tank, Walternate has had Olivia extracted from the tank and directs his <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> lock her up and sedate her.|$|E

On 2 September he was helped by Soviet <b>agents</b> <b>to</b> enter the Soviet Union from Finland. His abrupt disappearance caused much concern to many of the western intelligence services, especially those of Britain, Canada and the United States, that were worried about the escape of atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, and of Finland and Sweden, through which Pontecorvo and Marianne had been allowed to travel without valid passports and visas.|$|E
