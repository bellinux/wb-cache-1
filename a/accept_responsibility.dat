5|$|Chris's knee {{is badly}} injured when Danni's ex-boyfriend Stephen Montague (Damian Hill) attacks him. He {{undergoes}} surgery and the flirts with nurse Will Dempier (Christian Heath) when he suffers {{a reaction to}} the analgesic. Chris becomes frustrated when Hudson is not there for him, and questions how he can be in a relationship and feel so alone. He decides to ask Will out for a drink, but later cancels. Chris collapses due to complications from his surgery and is readmitted to hospital. He apologises to Will for cancelling on him and then tells him about Hudson. During Chris's next visit to Hudson, he appears distracted and when Hudson asks him if he is seeing someone else, Chris hesitates and Hudson breaks up with him. Chris tells Hudson about Will and how lonely he is. Hudson does not want Chris to date him out of guilt, and they say goodbye. Chris spends some time with Will and they begin dating, but the relationship ends when Will's dog, Napoleon, bites Kyle's dog Bossy, and Will refuses to <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> or apologise.|$|E

25|$|A {{spokesman}} for the IDF told the Guardian that, while it did not <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for Corrie's death, it intended to change its operational procedures to avoid similar incidents in the future. The level of command of similar operations would be raised, said the spokesman, and civilians in the area would be dispersed or arrested before operations began. Observers will be deployed and CCTV cameras will be installed on the bulldozers to compensate for blind spots, which {{may have contributed to}} Corrie's death.|$|E
25|$|Noda {{resigned}} {{as president of}} the DPJ to <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for its defeat in the 2012 election. The resulting DPJ presidential election was held on 25 December 2012, which was contested by Kaieda and Sumio Mabuchi. It was eventually won by Kaieda with 90 votes to Mabuchi's 54 votes. It was suggested that his rise to the leadership could lead to cooperation with Ozawa, who had left the DPJ during 2012 due to Noda's pushing through of a consumption tax increase.|$|E
25|$|Existential – Existential {{psychotherapy}} postulates {{that people}} are largely free to choose {{who we are and}} how we interpret and interact with the world. It intends to help the client find deeper meaning in life and to <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for living.

The therapist emphasizes the client’s ability to be self-aware, freely make choices in the present, establish personal identity and social relationships, create meaning, and cope with the natural anxiety of living.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the circus}} {{accepted}} {{full responsibility for}} the financial damages, they did not <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the disaster itself. The five men charged were brought to trial in late 1944; four were convicted. Although they were given prison terms, the four men found guilty were allowed {{to continue with the}} circus to their next stop, in Sarasota, Florida, to help the company set itself up again after the disaster. Shortly after their convictions, they were pardoned entirely. One of the men, James A. Haley, went on to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives for twenty-four years.|$|E
25|$|In Joe Keller, Arthur Miller creates just a {{representative}} type. Joe {{is a very}} ordinary man, decent, hard-working and charitable, a man no one could dislike. But, like the protagonist of the ancient drama, he has a flaw or weakness. This, in turn, causes him to act wrongly. He is forced to <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> – his suicide is necessary to restore the moral order of the universe, and allows his son, Chris, to live free from guilt and persecution. Arthur Miller later uses the Everyman in a criticism of the American Dream in Death of a Salesman, which {{is in many ways}} similar to All My Sons.|$|E

25|$|After the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919, between Germany on the one side and France, Italy, Britain and other minor allied powers on the other, officially ended war between those countries. Other {{treaties}} ended the relationships of the United States and the other Central Powers. Included in the 440 articles of the Treaty of Versailles were the demands that Germany officially <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for starting the war and pay economic reparations. The treaty drastically limited the German military machine: German troops were reduced to 100,000 and the country was prevented from possessing major military armaments such as tanks, warships, armored vehicles and submarines.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Army's officer-to-soldier {{ratio was}} {{extremely}} top-heavy, partially {{in order to}} compensate for the relatively low education level of the military manpower base and the absence of professional NCOs. Following WorldWarII and the great expansion of officer education, officers became the product of four-to-five-year higher military colleges. As in most armies, newly commissioned officers usually become platoon leaders, having to <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the soldiers' welfare and training (with the exceptions noted above). Young officers in Soviet Army units were worked round the clock, normally receiving only three days off per month. Annual vacations were under threat if deficiencies emerged within the unit, and the pressure created enormous stress. Towards the end of the Soviet Union, this led to a decline in morale amongst young officers.|$|E
25|$|The {{conclusion}} contained many factual errors: eating {{fish and}} shellfish from {{other areas of the}} Shiranui Sea, not just Minamata Bay, could cause the disease; eating small amounts, as well as large amounts of contaminated fish over a long time also produced symptoms; the outbreak had not, in fact, ended in 1960 nor had mercury-removing wastewater facilities been installed in January 1960. Nevertheless, the government announcement brought a feeling of relief to a great many victims and their families. Many felt vindicated in their long struggle to force Chisso to <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for causing the disease and expressed thanks that their plight had been recognised by their social superiors. The struggle now focused on to what extent the victims should be compensated.|$|E
50|$|Several {{assessments}} {{have been}} made regarding {{the environmental impact of}} the sawmill and associated activities. A 2004 assessment by Wesfarmers showed arsenic contamination in and surrounding a drainage channel to Lefroy Brook. The WA government <b>accepted</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the issue, as State Saw Mills used arsenic to treat timber in the 1920s. Wesfarmers <b>accepted</b> <b>responsibility</b> for groundwater and soil contamination with creosote, and the clean-up cost was shared by Wesfarmers and the State government.|$|R

25|$|Chomsky {{explains}} {{his decision to}} focus on criticizing the U.S. over other countries as being because, during his lifetime, the country has militarily and economically dominated the world, and because its liberal democratic electoral system allows for the citizenry to exert an influence on government policy. His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the negative impact that imperialism has on the populations affected by it, he can sway {{the population of the}} U.S. and other countries into opposing government policies that are imperialist in their nature. He urges people to criticize the motivations, decisions, and actions of their governments; to <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for one's own thoughts and actions; and to apply the same standards to others as one would apply to oneself.|$|E
25|$|Although a British consul was {{resident}} in Central Africa from 1883, {{as late as}} 1888 the British Foreign Office declined to <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> to protect the tiny British settlements there. Sharrer claimed to have purchased 363,034 acres in the area, and had attempted to induce chiefs to give up all their rights to their land. He may have intended to form his own Chartered company, or as Harry Johnston who was appointed as British consul in 1891 suspected, to acquire a form of sovereignty over the Shire Highlands and sell his rights either to Britain or Germany. Johnston rejected the suggestion that any treaties made before the British Central Africa Protectorate was established in 1891 could transfer sovereignty to Sharrer, but he accepted that these treaties were evidence of sales of land to him.|$|E
25|$|On many occasions, Doom’s {{only real}} {{weakness}} {{has been his}} arrogance. Layla Miller once reflected that Doom is incapable of accepting that he himself might be {{the reason for his}} failures. This is most keenly reflected in Doom’s continued refusal to <b>accept</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the accident that fully scarred his face, instead preferring to blame Reed Richards for sabotaging his experiment. While his high opinion of himself is generally accurate, he is generally unable to accept when others may {{have a better understanding of}} a situation than he does – with the occasional exception of hearing the recommendations of heroes such as Mister Fantastic or the Thing when it is to his advantage. Even when teaming up with others against a greater threat, Doom will often try to subvert the alliance for personal gain. For instance, while allied with Adam Warlock and other heroes against the Titan Thanos, he attempted to steal Thanos’ Infinity Gauntlet before its owner had been defeated.|$|E
