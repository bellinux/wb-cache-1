500|$|Dave Mustaine {{served as}} the lead guitarist for Metallica during their early days. However, due to drinking, {{substance}} abuse, violent behavior, and personality conflicts with band mates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, Mustaine was soon fired from Metallica. Two months after being dismissed, he and bassist David Ellefson formed Megadeth in Los Angeles. Mustaine later recalled: [...] "After getting fired from Metallica, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> is that I wanted blood. Theirs. I wanted to be faster and heavier than them." [...] Fueled by the desire for revenge, Mustaine elevated the intensity of Megadeth's music in order to challenge his former band. He sped up existing songs such as [...] "Mechanix", which Metallica's new line-up adapted into the slower paced [...] "The Four Horsemen". Mustaine included his original version of the song on the album to [...] "straighten Metallica up", as Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and {{said he could not}} play guitar.|$|E

I was off to join the Royal Shakespeare Company {{for the first time and}} Casualty didn't seem that {{interested}} in asking me to stay and do any more.|$|E
2500|$|The band went by {{the name}} [...] "Feedback" [...] for a few months, before {{changing}} to [...] "The Hype" [...] later on. After Dik Evans left the group to join another local band, the Virgin Prunes, the remaining four officially changed the name from [...] "The Hype" [...] to [...] "U2". Initially Bono sang, played guitar and wrote the band's songs. He said of his early guitar playing in a 1982 interview, [...] "When we started out I was the guitar player, along with the Edge—except I couldn't play guitar. I still can't. I was such a lousy guitar player that one day they broke it to me that maybe I should sing instead. I had tried before, but I had no voice at <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the day I found I could sing. I said, 'Oh, that's how you do it.'" [...] When The Edge's guitar playing improved, Bono was relegated mostly to the microphone, although he occasionally still plays rhythm guitar and harmonica. As of 2006, Bono has taken piano lessons from his children's piano teacher {{as a means to}} improve his songwriting.|$|E

2500|$|The {{recording}} subsequently drew {{comment from}} the entire band; other than the composer (McCartney), none appear to have fond memories of their work on the song: Lennon said [...] "I was ill after the accident when they did most of that track, and it really ground George and Ringo into the ground recording it", adding later [...] "I hate it, 'cos <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> is the track... did everything {{to make it into}} a single, and it never was and it never could have been." [...] Harrison characterised the song as [...] "fruity" [...] and commented [...] "we spent {{a hell of a lot}} of time on it", and later [...] "after a while, we did a good job on it". Starr added retrospective input on the finished result in a Rolling Stone article from 2008: [...] "The worst session ever was 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer.' It was the worst track we ever had to record. It went on for fucking weeks. I thought it was mad." [...] McCartney recalled: [...] "The only arguments were about things like me spending three days on Maxwell's Silver Hammer. I remember George saying, 'You've taken three days, it's only a song.' – 'Yeah, but I want to get it right. I've got some thoughts on this one.' It was early-days Moog work and it did take a bit of time".|$|E
