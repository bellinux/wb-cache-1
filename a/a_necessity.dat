The bishop of Chur proposed to Zita that she move into a residence that he administered (formerly a castle of the Counts de Salis) at Zizers, Graubünden in Switzerland. As the castle had enough space for visits from her large family and a nearby chapel (<b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> for the devoutly Catholic Zita), she accepted with ease.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This article {{challenges}} the Kripkean interpretation of <b>a</b> posteriori <b>necessities.</b> It will be demonstrated, by {{an analysis of}} classic examples, that the modal content of supposed <b>a</b> posteriori <b>necessities</b> {{is more complicated than}} the Kripkean line suggests. We will see that further research is needed concerning the a priori principles underlying all <b>a</b> posteriori <b>necessities.</b> In the course of this analysis it will emerge that the modal content of <b>a</b> posteriori <b>necessities</b> can best be described in terms of a Finean conception of modality – by giving essences priority over modality. The upshot of this is that {{we might be able to}} establish the necessity of certain supposed <b>a</b> posteriori <b>necessities</b> by <b>a</b> priori means...|$|R

5|$|Although only males {{produce the}} cicadas' {{distinctive}} sound, both sexes have membraneous structures called tympana {{by which they}} detect sounds; the equivalent of having ears. Males disable their own tympana while calling, thereby preventing damage to their hearing; <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> partly because some cicadas produce sounds up to 120dB (SPL) which is among the loudest of all insect-produced sounds. The song is loud enough to cause permanent hearing loss in humans should the cicada sing just outside the listener's ear. In contrast, some small species have songs so high in pitch that they are inaudible to humans.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies are {{distributed}} worldwide except Antarctica, totalling some 18,500 species. Of these, 775 are Nearctic; 7,700 Neotropical; 1,575 Palearctic; 3,650 Afrotropical; and 4,800 {{are distributed}} across the combined Oriental and Australian/Oceania regions. The monarch butterfly {{is native to}} the Americas, but {{in the nineteenth century}} or before, spread across the world, and is now found in Australia, New Zealand, other parts of Oceania, and the Iberian Peninsula. It is not clear how it dispersed; adults may have been blown by the wind or larvae or pupae may have been accidentally transported by humans, but the presence of suitable host plants in their new environment was <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> for their successful establishment.|$|E

According to contemporary biographers Theodore Beza and Nicolas Colladon, Gérard believed that Calvin would earn more money as a lawyer than as a priest. After {{a few years of}} quiet study, Calvin entered the University of Bourges in 1529. He was intrigued by Andreas Alciati, a humanist lawyer. Humanism was a European intellectual movement which stressed classical studies.

5|$|MAR used {{separate}} transmitter and receivers, <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> at {{the time}} due {{to the size of}} the individual transmit and receive units and the switching systems that would be required. Each transmitter antenna was fed by its own power amplifier using travelling wave tubes with switching diodes and striplines performing the delays. The broadcast signal had three parts in sequence and the receivers had three channels, one tuned to each part of the pulse chain. This allowed the receiver to send each part of the signal to different processing equipment, allowing search, track, and discrimination in a single pulse.|$|E

5|$|Slavery in Indiana {{occurred}} {{between the time}} of French rule during the late seventeenth century and 1826, with a few traces of slavery afterward.

5|$|The {{move was}} seen as an effort by the US {{military}} to prevent an international incident by not acknowledging that US pilots had violated Chinese airspace. Debate remains {{as to whether or not}} these airspace violations were <b>a</b> <b>necessity,</b> as US pilots were able to maintain air superiority despite being outnumbered in the war, and Chinese and Soviet pilots, who could have launched similar strikes on UN ships at sea and on targets in Japan did not do so. Still, many missions into Chinese airspace were authorized during the war. Informally, it was known that US pilots regularly violated the rule in a rush to down MiGs.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cleaning}} teeth {{is to remove}} plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria.

A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the gum line, where periodontal disease often begins and could develop caries.|$|E

5|$|Wood has {{traditionally}} been used for fuel, especially in rural areas.

In more developed countries other fuels are available and burning wood is a choice rather than <b>a</b> <b>necessity.</b> Modern wood-burning stoves are very fuel efficient and new products such as wood pellets are available to burn.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the sailors}} of both fleets fought hard, they were {{suffering}} from popular unrest; the mutinies in Britain continued to overshadow the Royal Navy, while the Dutch sailors were unhappy with French dominion and, in marked difference to their officers, were generally {{supporters of the}} exiled House of Orange. In addition, the Dutch were disaffected and poorly trained due to the long months blockaded in their harbours, which made them inferior seamen and gunners {{when compared with the}} highly experienced British crews, and the Dutch ships were more weakly constructed than their British counterparts with a shallower draught, <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> in the shallow waters of the Dutch coast but a liability when fighting warships built for the open ocean. The Dutch did, however, have the advantage of weight of shot, especially when their well-armed frigates and brigs are included statistically. Unlike their British equivalents, these lighter craft were intended to contribute in battle, covering the gaps in the line between their larger companions.|$|E
5|$|Anspach's {{backing of}} Suys' {{proposal}} was a calculated decision, {{as he had}} radical plans to transform the city. Anspach saw the proposal as an unexpected boon, as it allowed him to accomplish several of his goals at once. It had long been his ambition to transform the impoverished lower city into a centre of business and commerce, suitable for a modern capital (Belgium had declared its independence in 1830, with Brussels its capital). He wanted to attract the middle class, most of whom had left the dingy downtown for the cleaner suburbs, including the Leopold Quarter (now often called the European quarter) and Avenue Louise, causing a large loss in tax revenue for the city. The elimination of the numerous alleys and dead-ends in the lower town in favour of a large, straight, wide, open-air boulevard, linking the two rapidly growing train stations, seemed both <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> {{and an opportunity to}} beautify the city and improve both traffic circulation and hygiene.|$|E

5|$|Ordinary {{soldiers}} were merely recruited or conscripted rural farmers, while surrendered bandits and mercenaries also joined the military. Soldiers were not awarded official status by Confucian scholars {{as belonging to}} one of the Four Occupations; the scholar-officials were wary of condoning or legitimizing those whose lives revolved around the uncivilized practices of wu (violence). Even though the military examinations, rankings, and posts were parallel to those of the civil order, scholar-officials and the gentry nonetheless viewed military pursuits as uncultivated. Despite this disdain and argument of moral high ground, scholar-officials often commanded troops and wielded military power. Yet scholar-officials were not at the apex of the military or even civilian order; at the pinnacle of society was the emperor. The emperor's use of violence was seen as <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> to rein in rebellious elements of society and dominate violent and uncultivated Inner Asian tribes, who would then submit to the emperor and become transformed by China's superior wen (culture and civilization).|$|E
5|$|Sugar was {{a luxury}} in Europe until the 18th century, {{when it became}} more widely available. It then became popular and by the 19th century, sugar came to be {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>necessity.</b> This evolution of taste and demand for sugar as an essential food ingredient unleashed major economic and social changes. It drove, in part, colonization of tropical islands and nations where labor-intensive sugarcane plantations and sugar manufacturing could thrive. The demand for cheap labor to perform the hard work involved in its cultivation and processing increased the demand for the slave trade from Africa (in particular West Africa). After slavery was abolished, there was high demand for indentured laborers from South Asia (in particular India). Millions of slave and indentured laborers were brought into the Caribbean and the Americas, Indian Ocean colonies, southeast Asia, Pacific Islands, and East Africa and Natal. The modern ethnic mix of many nations that have been settled {{in the last two}} centuries has been influenced by the demand for sugar.|$|E
5|$|The envisioned status {{elevation}} did {{not merely}} serve a decorative purpose, but was regarded <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> {{to prevail in}} political competition. Though Frederick III held the elevated status of a prince elector, this status was also gained by Maximilian I of Bavaria in 1623, during the Thirty Years' War, also by the Elector of the Palatinate in the Peace of Westphalia (1648), and by Ernest Augustus of the House of Hanover in 1692. Thus, the formerly exclusive club of the prince-electors now had nine members, six of whom were secular princes, and further changes seemed possible. Within the circle of prince-electors, August the Strong, Elector of Saxony, had secured the Polish crown in 1697, and the House of Hanover had secured succession of the British throne. From Frederick III's perspective, stagnation in status meant loss of power, and this perspective seemed to be confirmed when the European royals ignored Brandenburg-Prussia's claims in the Treaty of Rijswijk (1697).|$|E
