40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Avian</b> <b>Infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> (AILT) is a {{respiratory}} tract disease {{of great importance}} because it causes significant economic losses in the poultry industry around the world. It {{is caused by a}} Gallid herpesvirus type 1, a member of the genus Iltovirus. The target system for <b>Avian</b> <b>Infectious</b> <b>Laryngotracheitis</b> virus (AILTV) infections is the respiratory system, and the main organ in which the virus remains latent is the trigeminal ganglia. However, the virus has demonstrated tropism for other organs besides the {{respiratory tract}}. The main transmission routes are ocular and respiratory. Infected birds with clinical symptoms are main sources of transmission, but birds with latent infections, litter, and contaminated fomites may also transmit the virus. Clinical signs usually appear 6 - 12 days after natural exposure and may be moderate or severe. The causative agent of this disease can be propagated in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of developing chicken embryos and replicate in mature chicken kidney cells, as well as in a variety of epithelial chick embryo cells, such as kidneys, liver and lungs. There are several procedures for the diagnosis of ILT such as the observation of clinical signs, the detection of gross and histopathological lesions, and the use of molecular techniques, including RFLP, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification. Vaccination with different types of vaccine provides a good expectation on disease control, such as vaccines produced in chicken-embryo-origin (CEO), tissue-culture-origin (TCO), and recombinant vaccines. However, in endemic areas, biosecurity measures and best management practices are important for the control of the disease. It is distributed worldwide and, in South America, it has been reported in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Argentina causing great economic losses...|$|E

40|$|To date, {{recombination}} {{between different}} {{strains of the}} <b>avian</b> alphaherpesvirus <b>infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> virus (ILTV) has only been detected in field samples using full genome sequencing and sequence analysis. These previous studies have revealed that natural recombination is widespread in ILTV and have demonstrated that recombination between two attenuated ILTV vaccine strains generated highly virulent viruses that produced widespread disease within poultry flocks in Australia. In order to better understand ILTV recombination, this study developed a TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping assay to detect recombination between two field strains of ILTV (CSW- 1 and V 1 - 99 ILTV) under experimental conditions. Following in vivo co-inoculation of these two ILTV strains in specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens, recovered viruses were plaque purified and subjected to the SNP genotyping assay. This assay revealed ILTV recombinants in all co-inoculated chickens. In total 64 / 87 (74 %) of the recovered viruses were recombinants and 23 different recombination patterns were detected, {{with some of them}} occurring more frequently than others. The results from this study demonstrate that the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay is a useful tool to study recombination in ILTV and also show that recombination occurs frequently during experimental co-infection with ILTV in SPF chickens. This tool, when used to assess ILTV recombination in the natural host, has the potential to greatly contribute to our understanding of alphaherpesvirus recombination. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|The genome of the <b>avian</b> alphaherpesvirus <b>infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> virus (ILTV) {{comprises}} ca. 155 kbp {{of which}} ca. one-third have been sequenced so far. To gain additional sequence information we analyzed two stretches of 15. 5 and 1. 9 kbp of the ILTV unique long (UL) genome region. The larger fragment contains homologs of the {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) UL 23 (thymidine kinase) and UL 22 (glycoprotein H) genes followed by five open reading frames (ORF) encoding putative proteins of 334 to 410 amino acids which exhibit no homology to any known herpesvirus protein. RNA analyses showed that these unique ILTV genes are indeed expressed. An origin of replication separates this cluster of unique genes from a conserved gene cluster consisting of the UL 45, UL 46, UL 48, UL 49, UL 49. 5, and UL 50 homologs. The absence of UL 47 from this position coincides with the localization of a UL 47 -homologous ORF within the unique short (US) region of the ILTV genome (M. Wild, S. Cook, and M. Cochran, Virus Genes 12 : 107 – 116, 1996). Within the second analyzed region the ILTV UL 21 homolog was found adjacent to the UL 44 gene. We thus identified five novel herpesvirus genes in ILTV and present evidence for a large internal inversion in the ILTV UL region, {{in contrast to the}} collinear genomes of other alphaherpesviruses.

The newly identified ILTV genes encode proteins of 63 kDa (UL 0) and 73 kDa (UL[− 1]), which both are predominantly localized in the nuclei of virus infected chicken cells.

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{vaccines}} for the <b>avian</b> {{respiratory disease}} <b>infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> consist of naturally attenuated {{strains of the}} causative agent—the herpesvirus <b>infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> virus (ILTV). Due to the dissemination of these viruses from vaccinated chickens {{as well as their}} possible reversion to more pathogenic forms, the use of genetically engineered viral vaccines lacking virulence factors while retaining antigenicity is being considered. Since the thymidine kinase (TK) activity of herpesviruses has been associated with virulence, inactivation of the encoding gene in the ILTV genome should attenuate the virus. Moreover, by analogy to other TK- herpesviruses, the ability of such ILTV mutants to induce a protective response in chickens should not be compromised. Therefore, the deliberate genetic alteration of ILTV was attempted. In order to prevent reversion and also to enable identification of the modified virus, a "marker" transcriptional unit (Escherichia coli lacZ gene fused to a SV- 40 3 ′-polyadenylation signal sequence and regulated by the pseudorabies virus gX gene promoter) was inserted via homologous recombination at one of two loci within the ILTV TK gene. Recombinant viruses were identified and plaque-purified {{on the basis of their}} ability to produce β-galactosidase. Retention of the foreign DNA at the predicted sites in the genomes of the recombinant ILTV was verified by Southern hybridization. Since their replication was unaffected by the thymine analog 1 -(2 -fluoro- 2 -deoxy-β-d-arabinofuranosyl) - 5 -methyluracil, the recombinants appeared to have a TK- phenotype. Despite this apparent deficiency, prior inoculation of either recombinant virus into chickens afforded the birds protection against a lethal challenge of virulent ILTV. Moreover, the degree of respiratory distress in the chickens vaccinated with the recombinants was relatively mild compared to the severe reaction in birds receiving the parental virus. Thus, ILTV can be genetically attenuated without an accompanying loss of immunogenicity...|$|R

The technology {{was found to be}} capable of the rapid, sensitive and specific detection of viral nucleic acids to an equivalent or better standard than the conventional peR assays used in our laboratories. 5 '-conjugated minor groove binder assays were applied to the detection of African swine fever virus, porcine circovirus type 2, and porcine parvovirus, swine vesicular disease virus and foot and mouth disease. The performance of these assays was equivalent to those of published assays and, in the case of foot and mouth disease virus and swine vesicular disease virus, to the assays currently used in the UK reference laboratories. A 5 '-conjugated minor groove binder assay and a Primer Probe Energy Transfer (PriProET) assay were developed for the differential detection, and potential genotyping of <b>avian</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> virus. These assays were compared to TaqMan and conventional peR assays. The 5 '-conjugated minor groove binder assay did not perform as well as the TaqMan assay in terms of diagnostic sensitivy. The PriProET assay proved to be equivalent to the TaqMan assay. Both assays were capable of detecting single base changes in the viral target and could therefore potentially function as genotyping assays. The porcine circovirus type 2 5 '-conjugated minor groove binder assay was applied to the quantification of viral load in a vaccine study. The assay was capable of quantifying viral load in vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups of animals, in tissues, sera and faeces. The assay performed better in terms of efficiency than a SYBR Green I assay but would require further validation in order to establish the accuracy of quantification, particular if it was to be used for diagnosis of "histopatological" post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome.

The gJ sequence resulted to be the most informative segment, it allowed the differentiation among field sample strains, and also, between wild and vaccine viruses. Specific changes in selected nucleotidic positions led to the definition of five distinct haplotypes. Tests for detection of clustering were run to test the null hypothesis that ILTV haplotypes were randomly distributed in time in Argentina and in space in the most densely populated poultry region of this country, Entre Rios. From this study, it was possible to identify a 46 [*]km radius cluster in which higher proportions of haplotypes 4 and 5 were observed, next to a provincial route in Entre Rios and a significant decline of haplotype 5 between 2009 and 2011.

Light microscopy and fluorescent terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labelling staining were used to evaluate the viability of mucosal explants, which were found to be viable up {{to the end of the}} experiment at 96 h of cultivation. The tracheal and conjunctival mucosal explants were inoculated with ILTV and collected at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h post inoculation (p. i.). ILTV spread in a plaque-wise manner in both mucosae. A reproducible quantitative analysis of this mucosal spread was evaluated by measuring plaque numbers, plaque latitude and invasion depth underneath the basement membrane. No major differences in plaque numbers were observed over time. Plaque latitude progressively increased to 70. 4 +/- 12. 9 mu m in the trachea and 97. 8 +/- 9. 5 mu m in the conjunctiva at 72 h p. i. The virus had difficulty crossing the basement membrane and was first observed only at 48 h p. i. The virus was observed at 72 h p. i. in 56 % (trachea) and 74 % (conjunctiva) of the plaques.
