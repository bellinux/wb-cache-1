25|$|In North America, the <b>American</b> <b>lobster</b> did {{not achieve}} {{popularity}} until the mid-19th century, when New Yorkers and Bostonians developed {{a taste for}} it, and commercial lobster fisheries only flourished after {{the development of the}} lobster smack, a custom-made boat with open holding wells on the deck to keep the lobsters alive during transport. Prior to this time, lobster was considered a mark of poverty or as a food for indentured servants or lower members of society in Maine, Massachusetts, and the Canadian Maritimes. It has been suggested servants specified in employment agreements that they would not eat lobster more than twice per week, however there is no evidence for this. Lobster was also commonly served in prisons, much to the displeasure of inmates. <b>American</b> <b>lobster</b> was initially deemed worthy only of being used as fertilizer or fish bait, and until well into the 20th century, it was not viewed as more than a low-priced canned staple food.|$|E
25|$|The {{next most}} {{important}} fishery by value is <b>American</b> <b>lobster</b> and Atlantic sea scallop. The Port of New Bedford, Massachusetts is America's #1 Fishing Port with fish landings valued at $369 million. Each year, {{there are nearly}} 50 million pounds of sea scallops landed there. The striped bass was driven to low levels early in the 1980s. Catch restrictions were applied in the mid 1980s, and by 1995 this species of fish had recovered. The region has valuable mollusk fisheries too. Offshore are sea scallops, surfclams, American lobsters and ocean quahog. Inshore are oysters, blue mussels, blue crabs, and clam fisheries. These fisheries are pretty much fully exploited.|$|E

25|$|Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was {{the first}} person to observe the {{difference}} between larval crustaceans and the adults when he watched the eggs of Cyclops hatching in 1699. Despite this, and other observations over the following decades, there was controversy among scientists about whether or not metamorphosis occurred in crustaceans, with conflicting observations presented, based on different species, some of which went through a metamorphosis, and some of which did not. This controversy persisted until the 1840s, and the first descriptions of a complete series of larval forms were not published until the 1870s (Sidney Irving Smith on the <b>American</b> <b>lobster</b> in 1873; Georg Ossian Sars on the European lobster in 1875, and Walter Faxon on the shrimp Palaemonetes vulgaris in 1879).|$|E

50|$|Excretory {{calcinosis}} in <b>American</b> <b>lobsters</b> in Long Island Sound {{was described}} in 2002. The disease causes mineralized calculi to form in the antennal glands and gills. These cause a loss of surface area around the gills, and the lobster eventually asphyxiates. Several reasons have been proposed {{for the cause of}} a recent outbreak of the disease. The most generally attributed factor is an increased duration of warmer temperatures {{in the bottom of the}} Long Island Sound.|$|R
50|$|As apex predators, heavy fishing of cod in the 1990s and the {{collapse}} of American and Canadian cod stocks resulted in trophic cascades. Overfishing cod removed a significant predatory pressure on other Atlantic fish and crustacean species. Population-limiting effects on several species including <b>American</b> <b>lobsters,</b> crabs, and shrimp from cod predation have decreased significantly, and the abundance of these species and their increasing range serve as evidence of the Atlantic cod’s role as a major predator rather than prey.|$|R
50|$|Paramoebiasis is an {{infectious}} disease of lobsters caused by infection with the sarcomastigophoran (amoeba) Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis. This organism also causes amebic gill disease in farmed Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar. Infection occurs throughout the tissues, causing granuloma-like lesions, especially within the ventral nerve cord, the interstices of the hepatopancreas and the antennal gland.

2500|$|Caught {{lobsters}} are graded as new-shell, hard-shell, or old-shell, {{and because}} lobsters which have recently shed their shells {{are the most}} delicate, an inverse relationship exists between the price of <b>American</b> <b>lobster</b> and its flavour. New-shell lobsters have paper-thin shells and a worse meat-to-shell ratio, but the meat is very sweet. However, the lobsters are so delicate, even transport to Boston almost kills them, making the market for new-shell lobsters strictly local to the fishing towns where they are offloaded. Hard-shell lobsters with firm shells, but with less sweet meat, can survive shipping to Boston, New York, and even Los Angeles, so they command a higher price than new-shell lobsters. Meanwhile, old-shell lobsters, which have not shed since the previous season and have a coarser flavour, can be air-shipped {{anywhere in the world}} and arrive alive, making them the most expensive. One seafood guide notes that an $8 lobster dinner at a restaurant overlooking fishing piers in Maine is consistently delicious, while [...] "the eighty-dollar lobster in a three-star Paris restaurant is apt to be as much about presentation as flavor".|$|E
40|$|<b>American</b> <b>lobsters</b> produce {{carapace}} vibrations, {{which also}} lead to waterborne acoustic signals, by simultaneously contracting the antagonistic remotor and promotor muscles located {{at the base of}} the second antenna. These vibrations have a mean frequency of 183. 1 Hz (range 87 – 261 Hz), range in duration from 68 to 1720 ms (mean 277. 1 ms) and lead to waterborne sounds of similar frequencies. Lobsters most often produce these signals using only one pair of muscles at a time and alternate between the muscles of the left and right antennae when making a series of vibrations. Occasionally, they vibrate their carapace by simultaneously contracting both sets of muscles. While the remotor muscle is required for producing carapace vibrations, the promotor appears to play a secondary role. Electrical stimulation of the remotor, but not the promotor, results in the production of vibrations, while lesions of the remotor, but not promotor, eliminate the ability of lobsters to vibrate their carapace. Lobsters of all sizes and both sexes produce these signals when startled, grasped or threatened. However, at this time, the behavioral significance of vibration and/or sound production by <b>American</b> <b>lobsters</b> is not known...|$|R

2500|$|Pteropods {{and brittle}} stars both form {{the base of}} the Arctic food webs and are both seriously damaged from acidification. Pteropods shells {{dissolve}} with increasing acidification and the brittle stars lose muscle mass when re-growing appendages. For pteropods to create shells they require aragonite which is produced through carbonate ions and dissolved calcium. Pteropods are severely affected because increasing acidification levels have steadily decreased the amount of water supersaturated with carbonate which is needed for aragonite creation. Arctic waters are changing so rapidly that they will become undersaturated with aragonite as early as 2016. Additionally the brittle star's eggs die within a few days when exposed to expected conditions resulting from Arctic acidification. Acidification threatens to destroy Arctic food webs from the base up. Arctic food webs are considered simple, meaning there are few steps in the food chain from small organisms to larger predators. For example, pteropods are [...] "a key prey item of a number of higher predators – larger plankton, fish, seabirds, whales". Both pteropods and sea stars serve as a substantial food source and their removal from the simple food web would pose a serious threat to the whole ecosystem. The effects on the calcifying organisms at {{the base of the}} food webs could potentially destroy fisheries. The value of fish caught from US commercial fisheries in 2007 was valued at $3.8billion and of that 73% was derived from calcifiers and their direct predators. Other organisms are directly harmed as a result of acidification. For example, decrease in the growth of marine calcifiers such as the <b>American</b> <b>lobster,</b> ocean quahog, and scallops means there is less shellfish meat available for sale and consumption. Red king crab fisheries are also at a serious threat because crabs are calcifiers and rely on carbonate ions for shell development. Baby red king crab when exposed to increased acidification levels experienced 100% mortality after 95days. In 2006 red king cab accounted for 23% of the total guideline harvest levels and a serious decline in red crab population would threaten the crab harvesting industry. [...] Several ocean goods and services are likely to be undermined by future ocean acidification potentially affecting the livelihoods of some 400 to 800million people depending upon the emission scenario.|$|E

The HP was the primary lipid reservoir in male and non-berried females. Among five moult categories (late inter-moult (mc- 1), early pre-moult (mc- 2), mid pre-moult (mc- 3), late pre-moult (mc- 4) and post-moult (mc- 5)), devised for the study, the prominent trend observed was a post-moult depletion of lipid reserves in the HP, PCM, and AM. An increased lipid index (LIn) in both CCM and PCM at late pre-moult suggested a differential distribution to provide needed energy in the immediate post-moult foraging period. Hemolymph plasma concentrations of triglyceride (TG), cholesterol (CHOL), and total protein (TP) were highly correlated (TG > CHOL > TP) with HP lipid content in male lobsters only, with the highest values obtained for inter-moult animals. Use of all three parameters in multiple linear regression model improved fit from 0. 6656 using TP alone to 0. 8226. Hemolymph evaluation presents a non-lethal alternative to assess hepatopancreas lipid content in <b>American</b> <b>lobsters</b> when sex and moult stage are taken into account.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study the {{chemical}} communication involved in aggressive and reproductive behaviours in the European lobster (Homarus gammarus). Both male and female H. gammarus established and maintained dominance, but the sexes used different strategies for dominance maintenance. Male losers recognised individual fight opponents and avoided them but fought actively against unfamiliar dominants. In contrast, female losers avoided both familiar and unfamiliar dominants, indicating that they react to the dominance status of the opponent. Unexpectedly, females used more high-level aggression than males. Blocking of the urine release in male lobster pairs with established dominance led to increased fight duration and increased aggression in a subsequent encounter, de¬monstra¬ting the importance of urine signals for dominance maintenance in male H. gammarus. Intruding <b>American</b> <b>lobsters</b> (H. americanus) have repeatedly been caught in European waters. Since the two species are closely related and have similar food and shelter require-ments, aggressive and reproductive behaviours and communication signals may be similar and result in both competition for resources and possibly hybridisation. Aggressive interac-tions between male European and <b>American</b> <b>lobsters</b> showed that interspecific communi-cation and dominance maintenance indeed occurs between the two species. Lobsters often reproduce when the female is newly moulted, but mating can occur {{at any time during}} the female moult cycle. Intermoult courtship and mating behaviours were common in European lobsters, unless the sense of smell (olfaction) was blocked in the male, indicating the presence of a female pheromone that induces mating. Female olfaction was not important for these behaviours. A morphological study of the European lobster antenna demonstrated unique sex differ-ences in size and distribution of the olfactory aesthetasc hairs. Females had more antenna segments with aesthetascs than males, and also had longer aesthetascs. In contrast, males had more aesthetascs per antenna segment, possibly compensating for the fewer number of segments with this type of sensory hair...|$|R
