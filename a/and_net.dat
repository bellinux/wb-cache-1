5|$|Between the 16th {{century and}} the mid-19th century, Britain saw a large {{increase}} in agricultural productivity <b>and</b> <b>net</b> output. New agricultural practices like enclosure, mechanization, four-field crop rotation to maintain soil nutrients, and selective breeding enabled an unprecedented population growth to 5.7 million in 1750, freeing up {{a significant percentage of}} the workforce, and thereby helped drive the Industrial Revolution. The productivity of wheat went up from about 19 bushels per acre in 1720 to around 30 bushels by 1840, marking a major turning point in history.|$|E
5|$|Ions in ionic {{compounds}} {{are primarily}} {{held together by}} the electrostatic forces between the charge distribution of these bodies, {{and in particular the}} ionic bond resulting from the long-ranged Coulomb attraction between the net negative charge of the anions <b>and</b> <b>net</b> positive charge of the cations. There is also a small additional attractive force from van der Waals interactions which contributes only around 1–2% of the cohesive energy for small ions. When a pair of ions comes close enough for their outer electron shells (most simple ions have closed shells) to overlap, a short-ranged repulsive force occurs, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The balance between these forces leads to a potential energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance.|$|E

5|$|At pH values {{between the}} two pKa values, the {{zwitterion}} predominates, but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative <b>and</b> <b>net</b> positive ions. At the exact midpoint {{between the two}} pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero. This pH {{is known as the}} isoelectric point pI, so pI = ½(pKa1 + pKa2). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the side chain is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative side chains, pI = ½(pKa1 + pKaR), where pKaR is the side chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pKaR = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side chains, pI = ½(pKaR + pKa2). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.|$|E
5|$|Juventus re-capitalized on 28 June 2007, {{increasing}} €104,807,731.60 of share capital. The {{team made}} an aggregate net {{loss in the}} following seasons (2006 to date): –€927,569 (2006–07), –€20,787,469 (2007–08), net income €6,582,489 (2008–09) <b>and</b> <b>net</b> loss €10,967,944 (2009–10). After an unaudited €43,411,481 net loss was recorded {{in the first nine}} months of 2010–11 season, the board of directors announced that a capital increase of €120million was planned, scheduled to submit to the extraordinary shareholder's meeting in October. Eventually, the 2010–11 season net loss was €95,414,019. In the 2012–13 season, Juventus continued to recover from recent seasons' net losses thanks to the biggest payment in UEFA's Champions League 2012–13 revenue distribution, earning €65.3million. Despite being knocked out in the quarterfinal stage, Juventus took the lion's share thanks to the largesse of the Italian national TV market and the division of revenues with the only other Italian team making the competition's final phase, Milan. Confirming the trend of marked improvement in net result, the 2013–14 financial year closed with a loss of €6.7 million, but with the first positive operating income since 2006. In the 2014–15 season, by the excellent sports results achieved (the fourth year in a row of Serie A titles, the tenth Coppa Italia title and playing the Champions League final), net income reached €2.3million. Compared to the loss of €6.7million last year, 2014–15 showed a positive change of €9million and returned to a profit after six years since 2008–09.|$|E
5|$|The {{balance of}} {{payments}} accounts summarize payments made to or received from foreign countries. Receipts are considered credit transactions while payments are considered debit transactions. The {{balance of payments}} {{is a function of}} three components: transactions involving export or import of goods and services form the current account, transactions involving purchase or sale of financial assets form the financial account, and transactions involving unconventional transfers of wealth form the capital account. The current account summarizes three variables: the trade balance, net factor income from abroad, <b>and</b> <b>net</b> unilateral transfers. The financial account summarizes the value of exports versus imports of assets, and the capital account summarizes the value of asset transfers received net of transfers given. The capital account also includes the official reserve account, which summarizes central banks' purchases and sales of domestic currency, foreign exchange, gold, and SDRs for purposes of maintaining or utilizing bank reserves.|$|E

5|$|In week seven, the Bears {{traveled}} to Landover, Maryland's FedExField {{to play the}} 1–4 Washington Redskins. Since 2001, the Redskins had won five of the previous seven meetings, including the last four games. However, the Redskins were 0–2 at home in 2013, and were hoping to avoid going 0–3 at home since 1998. The Bears' third-ranked scoring offense was a potential factor against the Redskins' defense, which allowed 395.0 yards and 28.6 points per game, two of the worst percentages in the league. On offense, Jeff Joniak writes that Chicago had to protect Jay Cutler and the ball, as Washington's 3–4 defense led to 75 quarterback blitzes, eight sacks, two interceptions, and four touchdowns. On the defensive side, the Bears looked to contain Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III and the read option. Additionally, the Redskins recorded 399.2 yards per game, the fourth best in the NFL. In the special teams phase, the Bears' 23 kick returns were a league-high, which led to an NFL-leading 24.6 yard starting spot. Meanwhile, the Redskins struggled the previous week against the Dallas Cowboys, allowing Dwayne Harris to score on an 86-yard punt return, and allowing him to return a kickoff 90 yards; they ranked last {{in the league in}} punt coverage with 19.1 yards allowed per return and 28th in kickoff coverage with 26.4. In the punting game, Adam Podlesh showed improvement in his punting hang time, with five of 26 punts returned, the second-fewest in the NFL. For Washington, punter Sav Rocca had the lowest gross <b>and</b> <b>net</b> averages in punting, and was one of seven punters to have a punt blocked in 2013.|$|E

25|$|Sertraline is {{the second}} most potent {{inhibitor}} of 5-HT re-uptake which has two very interesting characteristics that distinguish it i.e. sertraline's (1) inhibiting effect on DAT <b>and</b> <b>NET</b> and (2) the binding to sigma-1 (σ1) receptor in CNS. The DAT <b>and</b> <b>NET</b> inhibition is controversial because of much weaker inhibition which it has, compared to SERT inhibition. Sertraline has about 60 times more potent inhibition potential on 5-HT than either NE or DA re-uptake. It is possible that only modest inhibition of DAT <b>and</b> <b>NET</b> is needed to cause an increase in energy, motivation and concentration, specially when added to other activity such as SERT inhibition. Sertraline has also been found to have high affinity for the CNS σ1 receptors. A role of the σ1 site in the pharmacological action of sertraline may exist, but the significance of sertraline affinity for σ1 receptors remains unclear.|$|E
