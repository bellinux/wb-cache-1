5|$|Wenger {{appointed}} midfielder Patrick Vieira as captain after Tony Adams {{announced his}} retirement from football. Defender Lee Dixon left the club after 14 years, retiring {{at the age of}} 38. Arsenal did not spend big in the transfer market unlike their rivals and only made subtle additions to the squad: World Cup winner Gilberto Silva and defender Pascal Cygan. English duo Martin Keown and goalkeeper David Seaman extended their stay at the club for two <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> years respectively.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{electrical}} flaws, the Metroliners proved mechanically sound. Amtrak ordered over 600 non-powered Amfleet cars, {{based on}} the Metroliner design and also manufactured by Budd, in the mid-1970s. Beginning in 1987, Amtrak converted 23 former Metroliners for use as cab control cars on corridor trains. Fourteen more cars were used with minimal modifications - six as cab cars and 8 as trailer coaches. Most former Metroliners were scrapped between 2003 and 2011. However, some cab cars remain in use on Keystone Service and Shuttle trains. Three former Metroliners have also been converted to technology testing or track measurement cars, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> is used by Amtrak as a special-purpose business car. One original Metroliner is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Fliegerführer Afrika {{received}} orders on 4 August 1941 {{to downsize}} the 7. Staffel in Africa to four aircraft. The remaining aircraft and aircrews were {{to relocate to}} France back to Jagdgeschwader 26. Before Müncheberg arrived in France, he stopped in Rome where he received the Gold Medal of Military Valour from Mussolini. He then travelled to the Wolf's Lair, Hitler's headquarters in Rastenburg, present-day Kętrzyn in Poland, for the Oak Leaves presentation. Following the presentation Müncheberg went on two weeks of vacation. Following their return from North Africa to France the pilots of 7. Staffel were given newer Bf109F-4 aircraft in replacement for the older Bf109E-7 type. Müncheberg claimed his first victory here on 28 August over a Spitfire and another one, his 50th overall, on 29 August. He claimed two Spitfires on 4 September <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> from No. 71 Squadron three days later.|$|E

5|$|Glencross {{chose to}} forgo his final {{two years of}} college eligibility, signing a {{professional}} contract with the Anaheim Mighty Ducks on March 25, 2004. He was assigned to the team's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks, to complete the 2003–04 season. He scored two goals in seven regular season games, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> in nine playoff games. He remained with Cincinnati in 2004–05, appearing in 51 games and scoring nine points. He was moved to the Portland Pirates, also of the AHL, in 2005–06 and improved to 15goals and 25points in 41games while also appearing in 19post-season games.|$|E
5|$|In early September Nichols {{appointed}} a production control committee, headed by Major A.V. (Pete) Peterson. Peterson's staff tried various combinations, using mechanical calculating machines, {{and decided that}} the S-50 production should be fed to K-25 rather than Y-12, which was done in April 1945. The charts also showed that the proposed top stages for K-25 should be abandoned, as should Lawrence's recommendation to add more alpha stages to the Y-12 plant. Groves accepted their proposal to add more base units to the K-27 gaseous-diffusion plant <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> Beta stage track for Y-12. These additions were estimated to cost $100 million, with completion in February 1946. Soon after Japan surrendered in August 1945, Peterson recommended that S-50 be shut down. The Manhattan District ordered this on 4 September. The last uranium hexafluoride was sent to K-25, and the plant had ceased operation by 9 September. S-50 was completely demolished in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Marx and von Westphalen {{had seven}} {{children}} together, but partly {{owing to the}} poor conditions in which they lived whilst in London, only three survived to adulthood. The children were: Jenny Caroline (m. Longuet; 1844–1883); Jenny Laura (m. Lafargue; 1845–1911); Edgar (1847–1855); Henry Edward Guy ("Guido"; 1849–1850); Jenny Eveline Frances ("Franziska"; 1851–1852); Jenny Julia Eleanor (1855–1898) <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> who died before being named (July 1857). There are allegations that Marx also fathered a son, Freddy, out of wedlock by his housekeeper, Helene Demuth.|$|E

5|$|Other strong quakes {{occurred}} on January 26, 1700 (estimated at 9magnitude), December 14, 1872 (7.3 or 7.4), April 13, 1949 (7.1), and April 29, 1965 (6.5). The 1965 quake caused three deaths in Seattle directly <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> by heart failure. Although the Seattle Fault passes {{just south of}} the city center, neither it nor the Cascadia subduction zone has caused an earthquake since the city's founding. The Cascadia subduction zone poses the threat of an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or greater, capable of seriously damaging the city and collapsing many buildings, especially in zones built on fill.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall {{amounts of}} 4 to 8in (100 to 200mm) fell across {{the states of}} Jalisco and Nayarit. This {{rainfall}} caused one fatality in Jalisco after a mudslide fell on 10houses, killing one of the occupants. Five {{people were killed in}} Puebla by landslides, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> was crushed after a wall on his house collapsed. One person in Veracruz was electrocuted after touching a power line while doing roof repairs. In Michoacán, a man was struck by lightning under a tree in the outer bands of the storm, and two people died in Hidalgo when the roof collapsed in their house. Hurricane Dean killed 12people in Mexico but remarkably no one was killed by its first (and catastrophically powerful) landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula. Between the two landfalls damages, focused mainly in the agricultural sector, totaled Mex$2.05billion (US$160million).|$|E
5|$|The waterfalls in Ricketts Glen State Park {{are on the}} Allegheny Front, {{which is}} the {{boundary}} between the Allegheny Plateau to the north and the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians to the south. The headwaters of Kitchen Creek are on the dissected plateau, from which the stream drops approximately 1,000feet (300m) in 2.25miles (3.62km) as it flows down the steep escarpment of the Allegheny Front. Much of this drop occurs in Glen Leigh and Ganoga Glen, two narrow valleys carved by branches of Kitchen Creek, which come together at Waters Meet. The branch in Glen Leigh has eight named waterfalls and lies north of the confluence, while the branch in Ganoga Glen has ten named waterfalls and lies to the northwest. Ricketts Glen lies south of and downstream from Waters Meet; here the terrain becomes less steep, and there are fewer named waterfalls. The DCNR names only four in Ricketts Glen, all on Kitchen Creek; the USGS GNIS names these <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> on the creek, and Brown's book on Pennsylvania waterfalls adds a sixth named falls on a tributary.|$|E

5|$|Thompson {{continued}} to tour with the Pixies through 2005 and 2006. Though the Catholics were effectively defunct, they released two separate albums of B-sides and rarities, Snake Oil <b>and</b> <b>One</b> <b>More</b> Road for the Hit, on iTunes, {{with an eye}} towards a future CD release. Thompson was also working on more new solo material with Feldman {{in the first part}} of 2006, some of which they performed live. In the fall of 2006, Thompson began his first solo tour since 2003, taking Feldman, Billy Block, and Duane Jarvis along as his backing band. In October 2006, Thompson announced plans for the Pixies to start rehearsing and recording a new album in January 2007, but it is believed that no recording took place because of the reluctance of another member of the Pixies to commit to the project. In December 2006, he released the compilation Christmass album; a collection of new studio tracks, hotel room sessions, and live acoustic recordings from a solo tour the previous summer.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no.A4850, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> on 28 April. This last day's {{fighting}} {{left the}} S.E.5 so battered by enemy action {{that it was}} dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an Albatros D.III fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they shot {{it out in a}} head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of his craft. Clearing the oil from his eyes, he flew his S.E.5 home with zero oil pressure in an engine on the brink of seizure. He was so overwrought that it was some time after landing before he could finish thanking God, then dictating his combat report.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the bonus}} round begins, the winning {{contestant}} chooses {{one of three}} categories {{for his or her}} puzzle (prior to season 35, the puzzle and category were predetermined). After doing so, the contestant spins a smaller wheel with 24 envelopes to determine the prize. He or she is then shown a puzzle in the chosen category, and every instance of R, S, T, L, N, and E is revealed. The contestant provides three more consonants (four if he/she is holding the Wild Card) <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> vowel, then has 10 seconds to solve the puzzle after his or her other letters (if any) are revealed. The contestant may make as many guesses as necessary, so long as the contestant begins the correct answer before time expires. Whether or not the contestant solves the puzzle, the host opens the envelope {{at the end of the}} round to reveal the prize at stake. Prizes in the bonus round include various cash amounts (with the lowest being the season number multiplied by $1,000), a vehicle (or two vehicles during weeks with two-contestant teams), and a top prize of $100,000.|$|E
