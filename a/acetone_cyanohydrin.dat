40|$|Additional contributor: Kechun Zhang (faculty mentor) Methacrylic acid {{is one of}} {{the most}} crucial {{chemical}} feedstocks in the material industry and there is a high quantity demand of methyl methacrylate (MMA) which is the ester form of methacrylic acid. Every year million tons of methyl methacrylate is produced to synthesize polymethyl metharylate (PMMA) which is a thermoplastic material and it is used as a light or shatter-resistant alternative to glass. Therefore, to come up with a method for producing methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate becomes a popular topic of research in biosynthesis area. There are several traditional methods being used in the industry and the most common one is reacting acetone with hydrogen cyanide to generate <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrins</b> and then treat it with sulfuric acid to form methyl methacrylate. However, because of side products and reaction condition, these two traditional methods require high quality of controlling harmful chemicals and hard to increase the yield of target product. Whatâ€™s worse, the reactants are not renewable and emission will damage the environment. However, we have designed a new biosynthesis strategy to produce methacrylic acid. In this proposed work, glucose is converted to isobutyrate or 3 -Hydroxyisobutyrate. By using oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyrate and dehydration of hydroxyisobutyrate we could generate methacrylic acidThis research was supported by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) ...|$|R

50|$|Cassava tubers contain linamarin, a {{glucoside}} of acetohydrin, and {{the enzyme}} linamarinase for hydrolysing the glucoside. Crushing the tubers releases these compounds and produces <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> (ACH) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{used in the}} production of methyl methacrylate, the monomer of the transparent plastic polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), also known as acrylic. It is extremely toxic.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> {{has been}} {{determined}} to be the natural substrate of HbHNL, though HbHNL also shows activity with mandelonitrile, the natural substrate of PaHNL.

The natural substrate of AtHNL is unknown as no cyanohydrins have been detected in Arabidopis thaliana.|$|E
50|$|This {{action of}} the enzyme is used by many {{cultures}} to process cassava into an edible substance. The enzyme converts the cyanide containing compounds into <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin,</b> which spontaneously decomposes to hydrogen cyanide (HCN).

50|$|The poison was {{regarded}} as the readily obtainable potassium cyanide in Hirasawa's trial. One of the reasons given to doubt Hirasawa's guilt is because the victims' symptoms were clearly different from potassium cyanide poisoning, which is rapid.

5000|$|Friedrich Urech {{synthesized}} 5-methylhydantoin in 1873 from alanine sulfate {{and potassium}} cyanate {{in what is}} now known as the Urech hydantoin synthesis [...] The method is very similar to the modern route using alkyl and arylcyanates. The 5,5-dimethyl compound can also be obtained from <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> (also discovered by Urech: see cyanohydrin reaction) and ammonium carbonate. This reaction type is called the Bucherer-Bergs reaction.|$|E
50|$|The {{compound}} is {{manufactured by}} several methods, the principal one being the <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> (ACH) route. ACH {{is produced by}} condensation of acetone and hydrogen cyanide.

5000|$|Cassareep is {{made from}} the juice of the bitter cassava root, which is {{poisonous}} (it contains <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin,</b> a compound which decomposes to the highly toxic hydrogen cyanide on contact with water).

50|$|More than 3 {{million tons}} of methyl {{methacrylate}} (MMA) are produced annually. In one route, <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> is converted to methacrylamide sulfate using sulfuric acid. That compound is hydrolyzed to methacrylic acid, {{or it can be}} converted into methyl methacrylate in one step. In the second route, isobutylene or tert-butanol are oxidized to methacrolein, then methacrylic acid. Methacrolein for this purpose can also be obtained from formaldehyde and ethylene. Isobutyric acid can also be dehydrogenated to methacrylic acid.|$|E
50|$|The cyanohydrins are {{a special}} class of nitriles. Classically they {{result from the}} {{addition}} of alkali metal cyanides to aldehydes in the cyanohydrin reaction. Because of the polarity of the organic carbonyl, this reaction requires no catalyst, unlike the hydrocyanation of alkenes. O-Silyl cyanohydrins are generated by the addition trimethylsilyl cyanide {{in the presence of}} a catalyst (silylcyanation). Cyanohydrins are also prepared by transcyanohydrin reactions starting, for example, with <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> as a source of HCN.|$|E
50|$|Lotaustralin is a cyanogenic {{glucoside}} {{found in}} small amounts in Fabaceae Austral Trefoil (Lotus australis), cassava (Manihot esculenta), lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), roseroot (Rhodiola rosea) and white clover (Trifolium repens), among other plants. Lotaustralin is the glucoside of methyl ethyl ketone cyanohydrin and is structurally related to linamarin, the <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> glucoside also found in these plants. Both lotaustralin and linamarin may be hydrolyzed by the enzyme linamarase to form glucose and a precursor to the toxic compound hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
50|$|Linamarin is a cyanogenic {{glucoside}} {{found in}} the leaves and roots of plants such as cassava, lima beans, and flax. It is a glucoside of <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin.</b> Upon exposure to enzymes and gut flora in the human intestine, linamarin and its methylated relative lotaustralin can decompose to the toxic chemical hydrogen cyanide; hence food uses of plants that contain significant quantities of linamarin require extensive preparation and detoxification. Ingested and absorbed linamarin is rapidly excreted in the urine and the glucoside itself {{does not appear to}} be acutely toxic. Consumption of cassava products with low levels of linamarin is widespread in the low-land tropics. Ingestion of food prepared from insufficiently processed cassava roots with high linamarin levels has been associated with dietary toxicity, particularly with the upper motor neuron disease known as konzo to the African populations in which it was first described by Trolli and later through the research network initiated by Hans Rosling. However, the toxicity is believed to be induced by ingestion of <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin,</b> the breakdown product of linamarin. Dietary exposure to linamarin has also been reported as a risk factor in developing glucose intolerance and diabetes, although studies in experimental animals have been inconsistent in reproducing this effect and may indicate that the primary effect is in aggravating existing conditions rather than inducing diabetes on its own.|$|E
50|$|Cyanation {{reagents}} {{are highly}} toxic {{and should be}} handled with care. Most cyanating agents are commercially available, {{but a number of}} procedures are available for their preparation from alkali metal cyanides. Concentration, solvent, temperature, and time should all be optimized to minimize by-products. For alkali metal cyanide methods and methods employing <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin,</b> alcoholic solvents are commonly used. Special workup procedures are needed for reactions of imines, acid chlorides, and acid cyanides. Generally however, methods employing organoaluminums should involve a very careful basic workup (to avoid hydrolysis or epimerization of products). Chromatography should be carried out under acidic conditions to avoid nitrile hydrolysis (10% acetic acid is sometimes added).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Cassava {{has been}} widely used for animal and human nutrition. It has also been {{demonstrated}} to have antineoplastic and anthelmintic properties. Toxicity due to cassava consumption {{has been reported in}} ruminants and laboratory animals; therefore, this study aimed to investigate the toxic effects of <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin,</b> a metabolite of linamarin that is present in cassava, in Wistar rats. Six groups of five animals each were used to evaluate the toxic effects of <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> administered at 25 (G 1), 50 (G 2), 75 (G 3), 100 (G 4) and 125 (G 5) Âµmol/kg as a single oral dose. The control group received acidified water (pH 3. 5). The animals were monitored after administration of <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin,</b> and clinical symptoms were recorded. Serum enzyme levels were measured to assess the kidney and liver function. During necropsy, tissue samples were collected for histopathological examination. After administration, some animals in the G 2, G 4, and G 5 groups presented neurological symptoms such as convulsions, involuntary muscle contraction, staggering gait, motor coordination disability, prostration, and mydriasis. All of the animals in the G 5 and four animals in the G 4 group died seven minutes after the administration of <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin.</b> Animals in the other groups, particularly in G 2, recovered from the acute phase. Biochemical analysis revealed hepatic lesions and liver dysfunction. Histopathology revealed severe lesions in both the liver and brain. In conclusion, <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> has toxic effects in the liver, lung, and central nervous system in rats; however, at concentrations up to 25 Âµmol/kg, the animals could survive the acute phase...|$|E
40|$|In the cyanogenic crop cassava (Manihot esculenta, Crantz), {{the final}} step in cyanide {{production}} is the conversion of <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin,</b> the deglycosylation product of linamarin, to cyanide plus acetone. This process occurs spontaneously at pH greater than 5. 0 or enzymatically and is catalyzed by hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL). Recently, it has been demonstrated that <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> is present in poorly processed cassava root food products. Since it has generally been assumed that HNL is present in all cassava tissues, we reinvestigated the enzymatic properties and tissue-specific distribution of HNL in cassava. We report {{the development of a}} rapid two-step purification protocol for cassava HNL, which yields an enzyme that is catalytically more efficient than previously reported (Hughes, J., Carvalho, F., and Hughes, M. [1994] Arch Biochem Biophys 311 : 496 â€“ 502). Analyses of the distribution of HNL activity and protein indicate that the accumulation of <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> in roots is due to the absence of HNL, not to inhibition of the enzyme. Furthermore, the absence of HNL in roots and stems is associated with very low steady-state HNL transcript levels. It is proposed that the lack of HNL in cassava roots accounts for the high <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> levels in poorly processed cassava food products...|$|E

40|$|Cassava is {{the major}} source of {{calories}} for more than 250 million Sub-Saharan Africans, however, it has the lowest protein-to-energy ratio of any major staple food crop in the world. A cassava-based diet provides less than 30 % of the minimum daily requirement for protein. Moreover, both leaves and roots contain potentially toxic levels of cyanogenic glucosides. The major cyanogen in cassava is linamarin which is stored in the vacuole. Upon tissue disruption linamarin is deglycosylated by the apolplastic enzyme, linamarase, producing <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin.</b> <b>Acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> can spontaneously decompose at pHs > 5. 0 or temperatures > 35 Â°C, or is enzymatically broken down by hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) to produce acetone and free cyanide which is then volatilized. Unlike leaves, cassava roots have little HNL activity. The lack of HNL activity in roots is associated with the accumulation of potentially toxic levels of <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> in poorly processed roots. We hypothesized that the over-expression of HNL in cassava roots under the control of a root-specific, patatin promoter would not only accelerate cyanogenesis during food processing, resulting in a safer food product, but lead to increased root protein levels since HNL is sequestered in the cell wall. Transgenic lines expressing a patatin-driven HNL gene construct exhibited a 2 - 20 fold increase in relative HNL mRNA levels in roots when compared with wild type resulting in a threefold increase in total root protein in 7 month old plants. After food processing, HNL overexpressing lines had substantially reduced <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> and cyanide levels in roots relative to wild-type roots. Furthermore, steady state linamarin levels in intact tissues were reduced by 80 % in transgenic cassava roots. These results suggest that enhanced linamarin metabolism contributed to the elevated root protein levels...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the antitumor effect of <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells in vitro. METHODS: The Ehrlich ascites tumor cells and lymphocytes were incubated with different concentrations of <b>acetone</b> <b>cyanohydrin</b> (0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 10. 0, 20. 0 and 30. 0 &# 956;g. mL- 1), After 1, 2, 3, 4, 18 and 24 hours cell viability tests were {{performed by the}} trypan blue method. RESULTS: The results demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect against the cells of Ehrlich ascites tumor. The concentrations of 20 and 30 &# 956;g. mL- 1 was 100 % of cell death in only 1 and 2 hours respectively. In lower doses of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 &# 956;g. mL- 1 the cytotoxic effect was less intense, increasing gradually with time.
