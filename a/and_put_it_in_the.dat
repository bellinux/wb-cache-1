25|$|On 23 November, Ménez {{scored a}} {{beautiful}} goal as he calmy converted El Shaarawy's cross {{in the far}} net in the Derby della Madonnina against Inter. He then scored two goals and was named man of the match in the next game against Udinese. Ménez also continued his impressive form and scored a beautiful goal as he dribbled past 3 defenders <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> net as he helped Milan beat Napoli 2–0. Ménez scored two goals and created an assist in the 3–1 defeat of Parma on 1 February. He followed this with a penalty in a 2–2 draw with Hellas Verona on 7 March and a brace in a 3–1 defeat of Cagliari on 21 March, hitting a career high in goals for a single club (15, surpassing his previous best of 14 for PSG). On 4 March 2015, Ménez scored the winning goal after a long solo run against Palermo in a 2–1 victory, Milan's first away win of 2015. Ménez's season, however, ended poorly; on 29 April 2015, he was sent off for a second bookable offensive during the 3–1 defeat against Genoa and was handed a four-match ban for an insulting gesture, also missing the team's last match against Atalanta due to an injury. Ménez ended his first season at Milan as the club's top scorer, with 34 appearances and 16 goals in all competitions.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, film {{director}} Steven Spielberg bought a [...] "Rosebud" [...] sled for $60,500; {{it was one}} of three balsa sleds used in the closing scenes and the only one that was not burned. After the Spielberg purchase, it was reported that retiree Arthur Bauer claimed to own another [...] "Rosebud" [...] sled. In early 1942 when Bauer was 12 he won an RKO publicity contest and selected the hardwood sled as his prize. In 1996, Bauer's estate offered the painted pine sled at auction through Christie's. Bauer's son told CBS News that his mother had once wanted to paint the sled {{and use it as a}} plant stand, but Bauer told her to [...] "just save it <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closet." [...] The sled was sold to an anonymous bidder for $233,500.|$|E

500|$|According to biographer Barbara Victor in {{the book}} Goddess: Inside Madonna, Madonna wrote the song during her six-month vocal {{training}} with vocal coach Joan Leder in preparation of {{her role in the}} musical Evita. In a January 1996 [...] interview with Spin magazine, Madonna said that the song was inspired by a happy moment in her life, when she gave a chance to a man she knew, {{and he was able to}} fulfill it to her needs. She reversed the situation and wrote the song. Madonna explained, [...] "Often in my songwriting, I take things people say to me and turn them around, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first person. So it's actually something that was said to me." [...] Madonna did not reveal the name of the person who became the main subject of the song.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to Manchester Central railway station, where she waited outside in the car while he {{selected}} their victim. After a few minutes Brady reappeared {{in the company of}} Edward Evans, to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister. After they had driven back home and relaxed over a bottle of wine, Brady sent Hindley to fetch her brother-in-law. When they got back to the house Hindley told Smith to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light. When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for [...] "the miniature wine bottles". Brady led Smith into the kitchen and left him there, saying {{that he was going to}} collect the wine. A few minutes later, Smith heard a scream, followed by Hindley shouting loudly for him to come and help. Smith entered the living room to find Brady repeatedly striking Evans with the flat of an axe, and watched as he then throttled Evans with a length of electrical cord. Evans's body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own—Brady had sprained his ankle in the struggle—so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spare bedroom.|$|E

2500|$|Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{issued a}} {{statement}} saying that he was [...] "shocked and saddened" [...] to have learned of the downing of the flight. He also stated that while it was not clear what caused the crash, the Government of Canada continued [...] "to condemn Russia’s military aggression and illegal occupation of Ukraine, which {{is at the root of}} the ongoing conflict in the region." [...] Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird has called for a [...] "credible and unimpeded" [...] international investigation into the crash and called for pro-Russian forces to withdraw from the crash site. Baird also levelled blame for the accident on Russia and the rebels saying [...] "The Kremlin may not have pulled the trigger, but it certainly loaded the gun <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> murderer’s hand".|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} shot and edited in a cinéma vérité style, to look like it was taped with one {{hand-held}} camera, including jump cuts similar to ones found in home movies. T.J. Miller, who plays Hud, has said in various interviews that he taped {{a third of the}} movie and almost half of it made it into the film. Director Matt Reeves described the presentation, [...] "We wanted this to be as if someone found a Handicam, took out the tape <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> player to watch it. What you're watching is a home movie that then turns into something else." [...] Reeves explained that the pedestrians documenting the severed head of the Statue of Liberty with the camera phones was reflective of the contemporary period. According to him: [...] "Cloverfield very much speaks to the fear and anxieties of our time, how we live our lives. Constantly documenting things and putting them up on YouTube, sending people videos through e-mail– we felt it was very applicable to the way people feel now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{got into}} a long {{discussion}} with moderator George Stephanopoulos over whether states {{have the right to}} ban contraception or whether that was trumped by a constitutional right to privacy. Romney said, [...] "So you're asking, given the fact that there's no state that wants to do so and I don't know of any candidate that wants to do so, you're asking could it constitutionally be done? We can ask our constitutionalist here," [...] gesturing to Ron Paul, which drew laughter and applause from the audience. The discussion continued until Romney grew frustrated at the repeated questioning and asserted, [...] "States don't want to ban contraception. So why would we try <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Constitution?... Contraception, it's working just fine, just leave it alone." [...] Stephanopoulos later joked on The Colbert Report that he had a bet with fellow moderator Diane Sawyer that he could get Romney to say [...] "contraceptions are working just fine". Jon Huntsman, {{in response to a question}} on civil unions, joked, [...] "I'm a married man. I've been married for 28 years. I have seven kids. Glad we're off the contraception discussion." ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 2010 the 2008–2009 Annual Report of the President's Cancer Panel was {{released}} and recommended: [...] "Because {{of the long}} latency period of many cancers, the available evidence argues for a precautionary approach to these diverse chemicals, which include (…) bisphenolA". In August 2010, the Maine Board of Environmental Protection voted unanimously to ban the sale of baby bottles and other reusable food and beverage containers made with bisphenol A as of January 2012. In February 2011, the newly elected governor of Maine, Paul LePage, gained national attention when he spoke on a local TV news show saying he hoped to repeal the ban because, [...] "There hasn't been any science that identifies {{that there is a}} problem" [...] and added: [...] "The only thing that I've heard is if you take a plastic bottle <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> microwave and you heat it up, it gives off a chemical similar to estrogen. So the worst case is some women may have little beards." [...] In April 2011, the Maine legislature passed a bill to ban the use of BPA in baby bottles, sippy cups, and other reusable food and beverage containers, effective 1 January 2012. Governor LePage refused to sign the bill.|$|E
