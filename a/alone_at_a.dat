25|$|The {{overarching}} theological {{theme of}} the Deuteronomistic history is faithfulness and God's mercy, and their opposites, faithlessness and God's wrath. In the Book of Judges, the Books of Samuel, and the Books of Kings, the Israelites become faithless and God ultimately shows his anger by sending his people into exile. But in Joshua Israel is obedient, Joshua is faithful, and God fulfills his promise and gives them the land.

He sent an employee to her motel room to investigate; the employee found she had left a few minutes earlier.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{researchers}} such as Randolph Nesse {{have proposed}} that grief {{is a kind of}} psychological pain that orients the sufferer to a new existence without the deceased and creates a painful but instructive memory. If, for example, leaving an offspring <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> watering hole led to the offspring’s death, grief creates an intensively painful memory of the event, dissuading a parent from ever again leaving an offspring <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> watering hole. [...] More recently, Winegard, Reynolds, Winegard, Baumeister, and Maner argued that grief might be a socially selected signal of an individual’s propensity for forming strong, committed relationships. From this social signaling perspective, grief targets old and new social partners, informing them that the griever is capable of forming strong social commitments. That is, because grief signals a person's capacity to form strong and faithful social bonds, those who displayed prolonged grief responses were preferentially chosen by alliance partners. The authors argue that throughout human evolution, grief was therefore shaped and elaborated by the social decisions of selective alliance partners.|$|E

2500|$|To this end, {{companies}} {{make use of}} platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram [...] to reach audiences much wider than {{through the use of}} traditional print/TV/radio advertisements <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> fraction of the cost, as most social networking sites can be used at little or no cost (however, some websites charge companies for premium services). This has changed the ways that companies approach to interact with customers, as a substantial percentage of consumer interactions are now being carried out over online platforms with much higher visibility. Customers can now post reviews of products and services, rate customer service, and ask questions or voice concerns directly to companies through social media platforms. Thus social media marketing is also used by businesses in order to build relationships of trust with consumers. To this aim, companies may also hire personnel to specifically handle these social media interactions, who usually report under the title of Online community managers. Handling these interactions in a satisfactory manner can result in an increase of consumer trust. To both this aim and to fix the public's perception of a company, 3 steps are taken in order to address consumer concerns, identifying the extent of the social chatter, engaging the influencers to help, and developing a proportional response.|$|E
2500|$|... "Kim" [...] was {{the first}} song the rapper {{recorded}} for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998.

Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, [...] "I asked her to tell me what she thought of it.

2500|$|Season three saw the {{directing}} {{debut of}} one of the show’s developers, Miles Millar, who got to direct the episode [...] "Memoria". Welling describes Millar’s style as very succinct, to which he credits to Millar’s background of writing for all of the characters on the show. As Welling explains, Millar managed to capture the same effect as other directors, but with fewer words. Millar’s visual style, at least for this episode, tended to lean more to applying [...] "extreme lighting" [...] to the scenes, to create silhouettes of the characters. Miles Millar was inspired by the film Kings Row when he filmed the scene for Lex’s birthday party as a child. In the scene, a camera pulls back from a flashback transition to reveal a young Lex sitting <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> large table full of food and gifts. Instead of using the same techniques that were employed in previous episodes for transitioning between the present and the past, Millar decided to shift between the two time frames by transitioning between the older Lex and the younger Lex. This required Rosenbaum to rely more on Millar’s direction, so that the emotional level was matched between himself and the young actor portraying Lex, Wayne Dalglish. One particular scene seemed to provide Millar with the most trouble, mainly because of the constraints of the film division at Warner Bros. In the scene, Jor-El and Lara are placing the infant Kal-El into his spaceship during Krypton’s final moments. At the time, Warner Bros. was working on a new Superman film, and {{it was going to be}} an origin story. This affected how much Smallville could actually show. The film department prohibited Millar from showing Krypton, or Jor-El and Lara. As a result, Millar took inspiration from a comic book written by Jeph Loeb. In Loeb’s book, Jor-El and Lara are depicted as just a pair of hands holding on to each other after they place Kal-El into his spaceship.|$|E
