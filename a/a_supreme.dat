Some fans suggested <b>a</b> <b>Supremes</b> tour in which all living former Supremes would participate. Neither Jean Terrell nor late 1970s member Susaye Greene chose to participate. Lynda Laurence and Scherrie Payne were then touring {{as members of the}} Former Ladies of the Supremes. Mary Wilson agreed to begin negotiations, as did Cindy Birdsong. Negotiations, however, to have the 1967-70 lineup of the group perform {{together for the first time}} in a concert tour since 1970 failed when Wilson and SFX could not come to terms.

Laurence and Payne would later say they got on well with Ross. The Return to Love tour launched in June 2000, to a capacity audience in Philadelphia. The reunion tour, however, never made it through the first half due to a public lack of ticket sales.|$|R

From there, Hananu's administrative territory expanded to other towns and villages, including Kafr Takharim, and the district centers Harim, Jisr al-Shughur and Idlib. The municipal councils of these towns were not replaced, but repurposed to support the financial needs of the rebels and promote their social convictions.
