40|$|International audienceCollective {{bargaining}} between {{employers and}} trade unions has profoundly changed working conditions in companies around the globe. But {{why do we}} start work {{at the age of}} 10, 16, 18 or 24 ? Why do we work 6, 8, 10 or more hours a day? These questions are becoming increasingly pertinent as working norms are fractured and fragmented by country. This book brings an entirely new perspective to our understanding of changes in working time. In both the UK and the US, effective legal or collectively-bargained regulation of working time has been limited over the last 20 years, to the extent that its disappearance is seen as almost unproblematic. Here author Jens Thoemmes sheds light on this transition and its economic implications with a fully evidenced sociological account, based particularly on original research into cases of working time standards in France and Germany. This book addresses the whole process of working time regulation over the last twenty years, evaluating the <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> employers, and the State.

40|$|Current {{theories}} of unions are mainly {{theories of}} what unions were and did rather than theories of what unions {{will be and}} will do. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} book is to help make economic thinking about unions in Europe more forward-looking and to discuss the role that unions are likely to play in the changed economic environment of the new century. The volume consists of two reports that are the results of coordinated efforts by some of the most authoritative scholars in the field. The first study addresses a number of issues related {{to the question of how}} the primary role of trade unions—collective bargaining over wages and work conditions—is likely to evolve in the early decades of the new millennium. Starting from the widespread impression of a trend toward weakening union power, the main aspects considered by the analysis are membership, wage effects, organization and presence of unions, bargaining structure, macroeconomic performance, future scenarios, and strategies. The second study investigates the interactions between trade unions, welfare systems, and welfare reforms. The overall theme is the policy dilemma created by the many different <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> in the field of welfare provision, notably pension policies and unemployment protection. Throughout the analysis, a tension emerges between the role of unions as voice of atomistic agents and insurance providers—that may contribute to increasing aggregate welfare by remedying market failures—and as rent-seeking monopolist, underlying the intergenerational conflicts present within unions. The studies point to measures and strategies enhancing this second efficient role of the unions that draws mainly on their capacity to internalize to the employer–employee relationships costs that would otherwise fall on society at large. 1. Introduction In this part of the volume, the overall theme is the policy dilemma created by the many different activities of trade union in the field of welfare provision, notably pension policies and unemployment protection. Throughout the following chapters, a tension emerges between the role of unions as insurance providers, as institutions that facilitate agreements between different parties, and as rent-seeking monopolists. By making use of an interdisciplinary approach, the analysis rationalizes a set of distinct features of the interaction between union activities and union structure on the one hand and welfare arrangements and welfare developments on the other. 2. Unions' Involvement in the Welfare State Shows that there are important correlations between the unions' strength and activities and their welfare outcomes. The chapter provides a taxonomy of the large differences across countries in unions' strength and social expenditure. The analysis distinguishes among four dimensions of union influence: (1) unions as political movements; (2) unions and self-administration in public schemes; (3) unions and private pensions; and (4) institutional participation and political veto points. 3. Unions and Pensions: Theory, Evidence, and Implications The relationship between union actions and welfare outcomes is developed, taking the provision of old-age insurance as a natural example. This chapter develops the economic theory of how unions go about setting policies on pensions; it presents empirical evidence of their impact on occupational pensions and policies on state pensions and early retirement options; and it examines how union activities depend on labour relations institutions. 4. Learning from Welfare Reforms: The Case of Public Pensions Provides a detailed account of the position of unions on pension reforms across Europe. This example is regarded as a major indicator establishing whether unions have a truly solidaristic approach in negotiating reforms or appear to be driven mainly by internal membership considerations and by a strong seniority bias. 5. Unions and Unemployment Insurance Differences in unionization rates across countries appear to be related to how unemployment insurance is organized in different countries. The chapter presents the involvement of unions in the provision of unemployment insurance, highlighting theoretical considerations, policy arguments, and empirical evidence in favour of a particular unemployment insurance arrangement known as the ‘Ghent regime’. 6. Conclusions Summarizes the main findings of this part of the report, stressing how the seniority bias in unions leads to economic outcomes that are more favourable to older workers. It analyses the ways in which unions can counteract this tendency and choose policies that benefit both young and older workers. Four final questions arise: (1) Do unions interact with the welfare state? How do they do it? (2) What explains union policies toward welfare outcomes? (3) Which institutional structure emphasizes unions' welfare-enhancing activities relative to unions' rent-seeking activities? (4) Can unions contribute to a reform of welfare systems...|$|E

To fulfil these aims, a number of objectives were pursued including: investigating the campaign <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trades</b> <b>Union</b> Congress, the 13 unions with more than 150, 000 members, the <b>Trade</b> <b>Union</b> Labour Party Liaison Organisation, and any unions registering as 'recognised third parties' under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act; deploying the distinction between persuasive and mobilising campaigning, and the list of seven basic constituency campaign activities, elaborated by Denver and Hands in their studies of constituency campaigning in 1992 and 1997 (held at the UK Data Archive (UKDA) as SN 3587 'Constituency Campaigning in the 1992 Election', and SN 3922 'Constituency Campaigning in the 1997 Election'); distinguishing between different objectives of union campaigning (e. g. policy lobbying, increasing member/voter support for Labour) and different methods of campaigning (e. g. advertising, internal campaign material distribution, allocating staff to constituency campaigns). The study was carried out using a variety of mixed methods, by collecting campaign materials, conducting qualitative interviews with national, regional and constituency officers, conducting a quantitative postal survey <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> constituency co-ordinators, and using election data from the 2001 Election.

In his article the author analyses different concepts of „interest" in Polish labour law and formulates their typology. In particular, he analyses {{the concept of}} „the employee's interest", „the interest of an enterprise", „the interest of the factory crew". The author states that in labour law the concept of „interest" is connected in particular with the <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> which are appointed by law to represent and protect the rights and interests of employees. A characteristic feature <b>of</b> the <b>trade</b> unions' <b>activity</b> {{is that it is}} carried out not only in the interest of their members but in the interest of all employees. The author discusses separately the enterprise interest represented by the manager and the interest of the crew acting through their organs. In the author's opinion, a separate character of the enterprise and crew interests should not be questioned. A more clear distinguishing between different interests (interests of an employee, of a crew, of an enterprise, <b>of</b> a <b>trade</b> union: branch, regional, general) and allowing those interests to appear and collide secures higher economic and social efficiency of the economic and political system. It also leads to strengthening the position of enterprises and crews as parties of collective labour relations. Besides, the author distinguishes enterprises which are bound to carry out the interest of the state, not their own interest, because of their links with state organs or their functioning as state organs.
