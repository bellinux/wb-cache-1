The latter title {{was given an}} award by the U.S. State Department. The {{training}} and equipment Kim gained while working on these propaganda newsreels for the U.S.I.S. also enabled him to direct his first commercial film, Box of Death (1955). Kim used expired film stock and a manually operated camera from the U.S.I.S. to make this debut feature, an anti-communist melodrama about war orphans. The film, now lost, showed stylistic influences from the Italian neo-realists {{and was the first}} Korean film to employ synchronous sound.|$|E

In 1980 he caught a cold that developed into angina pectoris — the condition that had killed his father {{at the age of}} 58. He recovered and, by 1983, was medically cleared to fly, after which he resumed instructing at the various flying schools. However, fearing a second attack, he became cautious and limited his appearances at public events. [...] He stated: [...] "I am retired <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> civilian, and now I like to have my rest and peace. [...] I do not live for exhibitions."

He said that he was a libertarian philosophically, but a member of the U.S. Republican Party for the sake of [...] "expediency" [...] ("I am a libertarian with a small 'l' and a Republican with a capital 'R.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> Republican with a capital 'R' on grounds of expediency, not on principle.") But, he said, [...] "I think the term classical liberal is also equally applicable. I don't really care very much what I'm called. I'm much more interested in having people thinking about the ideas, rather than the person." ...|$|E

[...] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying [...] "I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't – frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother {{was one of the}} most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead – being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{attending}} a Pentecostal church which supported abstinence from alcohol, Palin, {{then on the}} Wasilla City Council, cast the deciding vote against restricting the hours during which the city's bars could operate.

[...] Straatmeyer continued, [...] "She felt {{it was out of}} line for me to testify on behalf of the church groups I represented." [...] The effort to restrict bar hours was intended to combat drunken driving and spousal abuse, but Palin felt that restricting bar hours would hurt the local economy.|$|E

In 1885 Morley spoke out against those Liberals who believed that all state intervention was wrong and proclaimed: [...] "I am not prepared to allow that the Liberty and the Property Defence League are the only people with a real grasp of Liberal principles, that Lord Bramwell and the Earl of Wemyss are the only Abdiels of the Liberal Party".

At the time of announcement, Gunn was a former IBA cruiserweight champion and bare-knuckle heavyweight champion, with a record of 72-0 with 72 knockouts. The fight was made official at the press conference on December 7. Jones spoke of his long-awaited desire to fight Gunn, [...] "I always do things that people don't expect me to do. I promised Bobby {{a long time ago that}} I would give him the opportunity, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> man of my word. Come February 17th, I am going to shock the world again." [...] At the official weigh-in Jones came in 199 pounds and Gunn weighed in lighter at 197.4 pounds. In a slow-paced fight, Jones stopped Gunn in the beginning of the 8th round, before Gunn had even left his corner, to win the vacant World Boxing Foundation cruiserweight title. Gunn injured his nose and was out boxed by Jones throughout seven rounds. In the post fight, Jones and Gunn both embraced.|$|E
