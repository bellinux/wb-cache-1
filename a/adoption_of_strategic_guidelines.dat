Over the past two decades, the barriers limiting breakthrough strategic design development have been studied in much detail. However, that research is based on well-developed practices in Europe, where strategic design and innovation capabilities have been nurtured for a long period. Barriers to the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> design practices and leadership have seldom been studied in high growth economies in which design and innovation competencies are not yet mature. We examined design-led innovation cases from Chinese design clients and consultancies, and uncovered twelve barriers to strategic design practice and leadership in China. Six of these are similar to hindrances experienced elsewhere, and the other six are unique to this study. We found that in China, certain constraints limiting the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> design in practice exist in the environment outside the firm.

However, its adoption by the Zambian public sector has never been subjected to critical evaluation. The aim of this research was to investigate the nature and extent <b>of</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> planning processes in the Zambian public sector. This research used a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods and was based on a multiple case study approach. The qualitative research used semi-structure interviews and documentary review on thirteen government ministries with the resulting data being analysed using content analysis. The quantitative research used a self-completion questionnaire on sixteen government ministries. The findings suggest an increase in the comprehensiveness and inclusiveness <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> planning processes <b>of</b> the Zambian public sector. However, challenges were evident {{in a number of areas}} including; integration of organisational processes, harmonisation <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> planning processes, completeness of the process, use of strategy tools and participation of operational staff and external stakeholders. Barriers established included; financial and human resource challenges, inadequate process alignment, inadequate enforcement mechanisms, inappropriate work culture, political interference, inadequate inter-ministerial coordination, inadequate communication <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> plans and inadequate strategic planning knowledge among staff. The findings of this research provide an important contribution by adding the Zambian perspective to the strategic management literature which, at the time of the study, had not been documented and subjected to critical review.

40|$|The journey {{takes us}} at the heart <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> {{planning}} in small enterprises (SEs). We explore the role of strategy and business models in SEs and how the two are adopted by SE managers, the level of involvement of their employees, and the outcomes on the enterprise. In the increasingly fast-paced and highly competitive business landscape systemic strategic planning provides small enterprises (SEs) with valuable opportunities to understand and thoroughly examine their enterprises’ internal and external environments, and identify ways to enhance the likelihood of steering the company towards a preferred future. In this in situ research initiative, which focuses on enterprises in the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, we seek primarily to gather {{a better understanding of}} small enterprise managers’ views on strategic planning. Secondly, we explore tools, techniques, and practices used. Thirdly, we explore the growing trend of business modeling and how it is welcomed by SEs. Our research team has uncovered a limited use or absence <b>of</b> systemic <b>strategic</b> planning amongst SEs. As a result, many SE managers have a preconceived notion that strategic planning is not for them and thus, at a cost, turn their attention to what is inherently most intuitive to them: operational planning. SE managers often focus on an isolated aspect of the process, such as sales or financial performance, rather than the integrated process, and thus fail to close the loop. Our research findings have identified a combination of key factors that impact the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> planning. To that affect, several recommendations are proposed to the stackeholders as means of increasing the systemic <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> planning in SEs...|$|R

New techniques are emerging in these special relationships, including the use of psychological contracts and co-measurement and monitoring.

30|$|In another survey {{exploring}} the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> formal <b>strategic</b> management practices among {{the small and}} medium enterprises within Mombasa County in Kenya, Irungu (2011) found out that a majority (53 %) of the SEs had documented their strategy process {{in the form of}} written plans and objectives. However, the communication of the plans was not elaborated as 53 % communicated by word of mouth indicating an informal communication system. The study thus concluded that the extent <b>of</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> formal <b>strategic</b> management practices among SMEs within Mombasa County was still low. This study goes a step further by examining why small enterprises resort to informal strategic management practices. In his study seeking to determine the strategic planning practices adopted by micro and small business in Kisumu Central Business District, Mutua (2012) also found that micro and small firms practiced strategic planning to varied degrees. However, the average rate <b>of</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> the <b>strategic</b> planning practices still fell below levels required for spur sustained growth and survival especially for those firms within Kisumu Central Business District. The study also revealed a gap between formulation <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> plans and their implementation. The study noted that SMEs seemed to over-concentrate on short-term operational issues as at the expense <b>of</b> long-term <b>strategic</b> issues. Further, in a survey on strategic management practices in small and medium enterprises at Kariobangi Light Industries, Nairobi, Kiruja (2011) also concludes that most of the firms surveyed did not have any formal strategic management mechanisms. These studies revealed interesting findings on the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> formal <b>strategic</b> management practices among small enterprises. These study findings therefore remain at discovering whether small enterprises practice formal strategic management or not. However, the studies did not examine whether informal strategies played a role in leveraging performance of small enterprises, neither did they delineate factors debilitating performance of the small enterprises employ. This study therefore goes a step further by examining the influence of each of the factors against strategies of the small enterprises.|$|R

The study was motivated by the importance of the SMEs sector to world economies and to Zimbabwe specifically given the level of deindustrialisation as well as the high formal unemployment rates. The findings of the study are useful to a number of organisations including entrepreneurs in SMEs as well as the Ministry of SMEs. Literature reviewed showed that SMEs contribute more than 80 % of most economies in terms of employment and GDP, a factor which makes SMEs very critical for any economy especially Zimbabwe which is a developing nation. In order to carry out the study a qualitative descriptive study was conducted from a total of 280 SMEs registered with the SMEAZ classified as agro-processing a total 70 were targeted from which 140 respondents were targeted. The response rate achieved was 57 % since a total of 80 out of the targeted 140 respondents were reached successfully and responded validly. The major findings were that 64 % of respondents indicated {{that they do not have}} formal long term plans and strategies in place. In addition majority of the respondents indicated that they were not taking advantage of physical, financial and human resources better than their competitors as sign motivated by the absence of strategies and plans like financial strategies and competitive strategies. However, these respondents indicated that they faced huge threats from potential and current competition and new products these all supported the view that the SMEs were not making use <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> management to deal with any potential threats beforehand. The SMEs indicated a number of challenges which affected their <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> management and some of the factors include the lack <b>of</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> management as well as the lack of technology and financial resources required to pursue their desired strategies. However, it is recorded on literature that implementation of strategies was a major challenge with over 80 % of strategies failing to be implemented. Finally the study found that SMEs required government support as one of the key factors for them to implement and pursue any strategies with some respondents indicating that they advocate for reduction in the taxation and licensing requirements which are very costly to their businesses. The study finally recommends for the increase in training of SME management on business management skills especially strategic management so that practitioners are aware of the requirements and contributions it can make to business success...|$|R

Results show that intersects exist on both driver and impact levels, and that the matrix provides an enhanced understanding of the system. Researchers conclude that there are various benefits from integrating the SPs and PBs, including aspects such as easing communication, informing prioritisation of urgent issues, and the development <b>of</b> <b>strategic</b> transformation approaches. Integrating SPs and PBs provides an enhanced definition of sustainability, from which explicit goals, criteria and <b>strategic</b> <b>guidelines</b> can be developed towards solving the sustainability challenge. ...|$|R
