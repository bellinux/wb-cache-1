40|$|The recent {{crisis and}} turbulences have {{significantly}} changed the consumers ’ behavior, especially through its <b>access</b> <b>possibility</b> and satisfaction, {{but also the}} new dynamic flexible adjustment of the supply of goods and services. The <b>access</b> <b>possibility</b> and consumer satisfaction should be analyzed in a broader context of corporate responsibility, including financial institutions. This contribution gives {{an answer to the}} current situation in Romania as an emerging country, strongly affected by the global crisis. Empowering producers and harmonize their interests with the interests of consumers really require a significant revision of the quantitative models used to study long-term consumption-saving behavior, with a new model, adapted to the current conditions in Romania in the post-crisis context. Based on the general idea of the model developed by Hai, Krueger, Postlewaite (2013) we propose a new way of exploiting the results considering the dynamics of innovative adaptation based on Brownian motion, but also the integration of the cyclicality concept, the stochastic shocks analyzed by Lèvy and extensive interaction with capital markets characterized by higher returns and volatility...|$|E

40|$|AbstractComputer {{forensics}} {{and privacy}} protection fields are two conflicting directions in computer security. In the other words, computer forensics tools try {{to discover and}} extract digital evidences related to a specific crime, while privacy protection techniquesaim at protecting the data owner's privacy. As a result, finding a balance between these two fields is a serious challenge. Existing privacy-preserving computer forensics solutions consider all data owner's data as private and, as a result, they collect and encrypt the entire data. This increases the investigation cost {{in terms of time}} and resources. So, {{there is a need for}} having privacy levels for computer forensics so that only relevant data are collected and then only private relevant data are encrypted. This research paper proposes privacy levels for computer forensics. It starts with classifying forensic data, and analyzing all data <b>access</b> <b>possibilities</b> in computer forensics. Then, it defines several privacy levels based on the found <b>access</b> <b>possibilities.</b> The defined privacy levels lead to more efficient privacy-preserving computer forensics solution...|$|R

As a consequence, the number and variety of devices allowing an Internet access has grown impressively and easilytransportable mobile devices have received an enormous success. More and more, new products are launched with an Internet <b>access</b> <b>possibility</b> and the trend now {{is the ability to}} get connected anywhere, anytime, anyhow. But, achieving such a task implicates an increasing complexity of the networking and service management. The fundamental multimedia applications, for which multicasting is the predominant delivery technique, need to be provided in a mobile environment. In this paper, we investigate the issues arising from the interoperation of mobile and multicasting mechanisms, focusing on specific multimedia constraints. From then, we propose an innovative protocol for an efficient delivery of multimedia services to desired mobile terminals. A solution for an anywhere, anytime, anyhow connection is hence presented. ...|$|E

The increasing amount and the diversity of national regulatory approaches to electronically delivered content services may be at the origin of this untapped potential. Obviously, the increased “balkanization ” of e-commerce via domestic regulations threatens to disappoint the early hopes for a global trading environment which was to be free of any trade barriers. New domestic regulations may also accommodate protectionist aims of national interest groups that want to avoid the competitive pressure of this new market <b>access</b> <b>possibility</b> (e-protectionism). The argument is developed in two steps. In the first part, it is shown that the increasing electronic delivery of content services creates a significant need for better developed GATS regulatory disciplines.

It portrays through oral reports {{of some of their}} leaderships the social representations of those subjects concerning being a quilombo remainder. Taking as reference that a quilombo remainder means every rural black community with “own history, endowed with specific territorial relationships, with presumption of black ancestrality related to the resistance to the suffered historical oppression” (Normative Instruction 49 of INCRA) and that in front of the <b>access</b> <b>possibility</b> to the specific public politics and to the title of the occupied lands, many of them face the dilemma of recognizing themselves as a quilombo remainder or not. The group was questioned about the understanding of recognizing him or herself as a quilombo remainder, since this definition comes from outside to inside of the group; how the quilombola identity construction process occurs in the communities of the Mucuri Valley. Este artigo apresenta três comunidades pré-identificadas como remanescentes de quilombo, pertencentes ao município de Teófilo Otoni, mesorregião do Vale do Mucuri, Minas Gerais, e retrata, por meio dos relatos orais de algumas de suas lideranças, as representações sociais desses sujeitos acerca do ser remanescente de quilombo.

40|$|As {{the future}} melting pot of {{different}} forms of energy, home energy system {{is one of the}} key enablersto the smart grid technology. The development of such kind of smart home technologies with focus on demand response has gained interest in order to exploit potential demand and supply flexibility of decentralized energy systems. This flexibility could be used to support the optimized operation of the renewable home energy systems, which may have volatile power output depending on fluctuating environmental conditions. An optimized demand response strategy leads directly to the reduction of carbon emission, energy cost saving as well as thermal comfort improvement. As one representative type of the renewable home energy systems, the air source heat pump has a considerable penetration rate on the electrical grid of residential quarters due to its low commissioning expenditure, high installation flexibility and better <b>access</b> <b>possibility</b> to the smart grid. Thus, the research and development of the active thermal management strategy based on residential air source heat pump system with respect to the evolving demand response technologies is selected as the focus of this dissertation. In Chapter 1, the developing trend of home energy systems and some basic demand response backgrounds are introduced. The drawbacks and difficulties of the existing home energy management system are argued while being merged into the future smart grid framework. Based on the requirement analysis and the state-of-the-art technologies, the solution approach from conception to validation of the active management strategy is proposed in Chapter 2. The target system to be investigated, comprising a typical air source heat pump system with a domestic hot water storage tank and a single-family house, are described in Chapter 3. The idea and technical implementation of the proposed solution are depicted in Chapter 4 and 5, including the self-adaptive system modeling approach, the predictive modulation solver for the electrical compressor as well as the demand-actuated domestic hot water tank management strategy. As another highlight of this dissertation, the Hardware-in-the-Loop test approach for home energy systems is developed in order to test, validate and evaluate the implemented control prototype under realistic operation conditions. In Chapter 6, the function principle and the composition of the Hardware-in-the-Loop test platform are introduced, including the multiphysical emulation system, the infrastructural design on signal level as well as the interfacing and integration of the software components. Following the proposed dynamic test approach, the developed prototype of the home energy management system is quantitatively evaluated by various assessment criteria under different realistic test scenarios in comparison to several existing commercialized solutions, which are explicitly analyzed in Chapter 7...|$|E
