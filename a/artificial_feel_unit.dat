5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was controlled by}} a fighter-type control stick and rudder bar which operated the powered flying controls (PFCs). Each PFC had a single electro-hydraulic powered flying control unit (PFCU) except the rudder which had two, one running as a back-up. <b>Artificial</b> <b>feel</b> and autostabilisation {{in the form of}} pitch and yaw dampers were provided, as well as an auto mach trimmer.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper shows a {{preliminary}} experimental {{evaluation of a}} novel haptic aiding for Remotely Piloted Vehicles. The aerodynamically-inspired haptic feedback law was named Conventional Aircraft <b>Artificial</b> <b>Feel,</b> and was implemented as a variable stiffness spring. The experimental set-up comprises a fully nonlinear mathematical model of the aircraft, a visual display and a haptic device (a 3 DoF Omega Device). The tests, performed using a set of 18 naïve subjects, show {{the validity of the}} proposed approach...|$|R
50|$|The first non-experimental {{aircraft}} {{that was designed}} and flown (in 1958) with a {{fly-by-wire flight control system}} was the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow, a feat not repeated with a production aircraft until Concorde in 1969. This system also included solid-state components and system redundancy, was designed to be integrated with a computerised navigation and automatic search and track radar, was flyable from ground control with data uplink and downlink, and provided <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> (feedback) to the pilot.|$|R
500|$|The Victor had fully {{duplicated}} powered controls; many of {{the flight}} controls and flight surfaces were designed with redundancies. Pilot control movements were transmitted via a low-friction mechanical system. This setup was developed to provide, amongst other capabilities, a level of <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> to the pilot. Eight separated hydraulic circuits were present on the aircraft, which comprised the alighting gear, flaps, nose flaps, air brakes, bomb doors, wheel brakes, nose-wheel steering, and the ram-air turbine scoops. An AC electrical system and auxiliary power unit were significant additions upon the later Victor B.2, electrical reliability being noticeably improved.|$|R
2500|$|The Delta 2 had a {{relatively}} small cockpit, in which the single pilot was housed, which had little room for the installation of additional equipment. The Delta was the first British aircraft to fly using all-powered controls. These controls, designed and produced by Fairey, were fully duplicated. The flight control system was hydraulically operated and possessed no mechanical backup. Fairey had recently developed a new high-pressure hydraulic system and this {{was used in the}} design. The hydraulics provided no feedback or [...] "feel" [...] to the pilot's controls, so another system providing <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> was necessary.|$|R
50|$|The G.91 is {{equipped}} with an swept wing, which uses an all-metal two-spar structure; the outer panels can all be detached for transportation or easy replacement, while the center section is integral with the fuselage. It is swept at a 37-degree angle at quarter-chord with a thickness-to-chord ratio of 10 per cent. The wing features single-slotted flaps and hydraulically-actuated ailerons. The tailplane is electrically actuated and had irreversible hydraulic elevators fitted with an <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> system as well as hydraulically-actuated air brakes and a drogue parachute located {{at the base of}} the rudder for rapid deceleration.|$|R

500|$|Originally the BBC was {{the sole}} {{producer}} of Persuasion, until it partnered with the American company WGBH Boston and the French company Millesime. This decision gave the production a larger budget and allowed it to be filmed at locations featured in the novel, including Lyme Regis and Bath. Michell believed this was Austen's most emotional and poignant novel, {{as well as her}} most autobiographical. While directing, he avoided what he felt was the polished, <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> of other 19th-century depictions, and discouraged his actors from wearing make-up or appearing too hygienic. Costume designer Alexandra Byrne produced clothing that appeared [...] "lived-in", winning a BAFTA for her efforts.|$|R
500|$|The primary flight {{controls}} of the Tornado are a fly-by-wire hybrid, consisting of an analogue [...] Command and Stability Augmentation System (CSAS) {{connected to a}} digital Autopilot & Flight Director System (AFDS); in addition a level of mechanical reversion capacity was retained to safeguard against potential failure. To enhance pilot awareness, <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> was built into the {{flight controls}}, such as the centrally located stick; because of the Tornado's variable wings enabling the aircraft to drastically alter its flight envelope, the artificial responses adjust automatically to wing profile changes and other changes to flight attitude. As a large variety of munitions and stores can be outfitted, the resulting changes to the aircraft's flight dynamics are routinely compensated for by the flight stability system.|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} for varying {{effective dihedral}} in flight {{by means of}} servo actuation of the ailerons in response to sideslip angle is described. The results of brief flight tests of the apparatus on a conventional fighter airplane are presented and discussed. The apparatus is shown to have satisfactory simulated {{a wide range of}} effective dihedral under static and dynamic conditions. The effects of a small amount of servo lag are shown to be measurable when the apparatus is simulating small negative values of dihedral. However, these effects were not considered by the pilots to give the airplane an <b>artificial</b> <b>feel.</b> The results of an investigation employing the apparatus to determine the tolerable (safe for normal fighter operation) range of effective dihedral on the test airplane are presented...|$|R
50|$|The flight {{controls}} of the Valiant {{consisted of two}} channels of power control with full manual backup; flying in manual was allowed but limited, being intended to be used only {{in the event of}} complete electrical failure. The {{flight controls}} reportedly required considerable effort to manually operate. All three axis of the flight controls featured a dynamic <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> system, the pressure for which was provided via a ram-air inlet. A Smith Aerospace autopilot and instrument landing system (ILS) functionality was installed along with various navigational aids, such as the Marconi Company-built Green Satin doppler radar, Gee radio navigation, Automatic Direction Finder (ADF), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), and radar altimeters. Provisions for additional equipment and sensors, such as side looking airborne radar, were also made.|$|R

500|$|The inquiry's {{recommendations}} {{revolved around}} the enforcement of stricter speed limits during turbulence, and two significant design changes also resulted: all Comets were equipped with weather radar and the [...] "Q feel" [...] system was introduced, which ensured that control column forces (invariably called stick forces) would be proportional to control loads. This <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> {{was the first of}} its kind to be introduced in any aircraft. [...] The Comet 1 and 1A had been criticised for a lack of [...] "feel" [...] in their controls, [...] and investigators suggested that this might have contributed to the pilot's alleged over-stressing of the aircraft; Comet chief test pilot John Cunningham contended, however, that the jetliner flew smoothly and was highly responsive in a manner consistent with other de Havilland aircraft.|$|R
40|$|The X- 22 A {{has four}} ducted {{propellers}} and four engines. The engines {{are connected to}} a common system of rotating shafts which distribute propulsive power to the four propellers. Changes {{in the direction of}} the thrust vector are accomplished by rotating the ducts, which are interconnected so that all rotate through the same angle. Thrust magnitude is determined by a collective pitch lever, very similar to a helicopter. There are four variable stability system (VSS) controllers: thrust, pitch, roll, and yaw, and three <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> servos for the evaluation pilot cockpit controls, each employing electrohydraulic servos. Longitudinal flying qualities for STOL landing approach, and lateral-directional flying qualities and control power requirements for STOL landing approach are discussed. Attention is given to the data acquisition and processing system...|$|R
50|$|The Dassault Falcon 20 is a French {{business}} jet, {{often considered}} to be an easy to fly and relatively visually appealing aircraft. The favourable flight qualities of the aircraft meant that {{there was no need to}} incorporate a stick pusher or stall-barrier systems in order to achieve its predictable stall behaviour. The flight controls of the Falcon 20 are hydraulically-powered, augmenting the mechanical pushrods between the cockpit controls and the flight control surfaces. In the event of complete hydraulic failure, the aircraft can be practically flown without any augmentation. The controls incorporate an <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> system, optimising the sensations perceivable to the operating pilot to be smooth, predictable, and precise. On the Falcon 200, the cockpit is heavily modernised, being more comparable with the newer Falcon 50 and Falcon 200 than the original Falcon 20.|$|R

2500|$|The Tornado ADV's {{differences}} {{compared to}} the IDS include a greater sweep angle on the wing gloves, and the deletion of their kruger flaps, deletion of the port cannon, a longer radome for the Foxhunter radar, slightly longer airbrakes and a fuselage stretch of 1.36m to allow the carriage of four Skyflash semi-active radar homing missiles. The stretch {{was applied to the}} Tornado front fuselage being built by the UK, with a plug being added immediately behind the cockpit, which had the unexpected benefit of reducing drag and making space for an additional fuel tank (Tank '0') carrying [...] of fuel. The <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> of the flight controls was lighter on the ADV than on the IDS. Various internal avionics, pilot displays, guidance systems and software also differed; including an automatic wing sweep selector not fitted to the strike aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|In 1956, Vickers had {{performed}} {{a series of}} low level tests in WZ383 to assess the type for low level flight at high speed. Several modifications to the aircraft were made, including a metal radome, debris guards on the two inboard engines, after six flights the aileron and elevator <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> was reduced by 50%. Pilots reported problems with cabin heating and condensation that would need remedying. The aircraft was fitted with data recording equipment and this data was used by Vickers to estimate the remaining safe life of the type under these flying conditions. Initially a safe life of 75 hours was recommended, which became [...] "the real figure might be less than 200 hours". The number of hours flown by each Valiant in a year was viewed as being an operational issue for the RAF.|$|R

40|$|Describes a {{steering}} system in an all-terrain four-wheeled vehicle with independent suspension where the necessary forces for wheels to respond to steering control is supplied by fluid pressure or electrical actuators mounted parallel to the suspension arm between vehicle frame and wheel control arm. Steering control by the driver is by manipulation of right and/or left steering levers eliminating the need of steering wheel and steering column {{in front of the}} driver. The steering actuators are independent and there is no tracking rod or other linkage for coordinating their turning angles. Close coordination of the wheel turning angles for achieving the Ackerman angle relation or other non-linear turning angle relation between the wheels is by a now-linear linkage between left and right steering levers or elsewhere or by a computer control for electric actuators. Optionally, a computer control in an electrical system has inputs for acceleration and velocity for detecting hazards associated with steering and inputs to provide <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> signals to the hand levers...|$|R
5000|$|After {{completing}} his {{studies in the}} United States, he returned to an independent India and joined Hindustan Aircraft Limited, where {{he worked in the}} design department until 1954. In 1953, his expertise was sought in investigating the crash of a British Overseas Aircraft Corporation Comet aircraft, which had crashed in a severe thundersquall six minutes after taking off from Calcutta-Dum Dum airport (now Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport). In his report, he suggested that the elevator control system in the Comet operated with booster power with no feedback arrangement for pilot feel, and this {{may have contributed to the}} pilot over-controlling the aircraft. From this inquiry, two significant design changes resulted: all Comets were equipped with weather radar, and the [...] "Q feel" [...] system was introduced, which ensured that control column forces (invariably called stick forces) would be proportional to control loads. This <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> was the first of its kind to be introduced in any aircraft.|$|R

25|$|The SA.4 was {{designed}} for a crew of five: pilot, copilot, bombardier ("air bomber"), navigator and radio operator. The prone bombardier's position was a tube extending forward of the cockpit above the radome; the crew compartment being pressurized. These positions were fitted with opaque nosecones, as the Sperrins were never used for live bombing. The pilot was {{the only member of}} the crew to have a Martin-Baker-produced ejector seat underneath a jettisonable roof panel; other crew members were intended to bail out via a door located under the navigator's console. The other three crew positions were located behind the pilots, facing rearwards. Unusually, the pilot's flying controls lacked any direct connection to the aircraft's flight control surfaces, control input was instead directed into a gearbox to actuate rotatable ball-screw jacks to move each flight surface via aerodynamic load instead; a corresponding <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> system was also installed. Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist describe the control system as having been simple, light, reliable, and low-friction and contrast it positively against powered systems of the era.|$|R
500|$|Test {{pilot and}} naval aviator Captain Eric Brown {{evaluated}} the first prototype and found [...] "the controls in cruising flight were very heavy and, in fact, lateral control was so solid that I could barely move the ailerons {{with one hand}} at [...]" [...] In bad weather a pilot circling a carrier while waiting to land would {{have been forced to}} fly such a wide circuit that he could not always keep the carrier in sight. The later prototypes had ailerons boosted by hydraulic power and <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> to the stick from a spring, as an interim measure but Brown found [...] "the second prototype was much less the pleasant aircraft to fly as the stick continually hunted either side of neutral and there was no build up of stick force with increase in speed." [...] The Spearfish lacked any sort of stall warning, which would have been a problem in operational use as the stall and approach speeds were fairly close. For the landing, the aircraft proved quite docile.|$|R
2500|$|With purely {{mechanical}} {{flight control}} systems, the aerodynamic {{forces on the}} control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot, allowing tactile feedback of airspeed.

[...] The fulcrum of this device was moved in proportion to the square of the air speed (for the elevators) to give increased resistance at higher speeds. For the controls of the American Vought F-8 Crusader and the LTV A-7 Corsair II warplanes, a 'bob-weight' was used in the pitch axis of the control stick, giving force feedback that was proportional to the airplane's normal acceleration.|$|R

40|$|In “On the {{psychology}} of self-deception, ” David Shapiro (1996) considers a man talking about a difficult decision he has made. The man says: “I know I did the right thing! ” with exaggerated emphasis on “know, ” {{and he says it}} more loudly than he would in ordinary conversation. Shapiro characterizes this as the man’s attempt to dispel his own doubts, as much to convince himself of the content of what he is saying as to convince his listener; it is thus an attempt at self-deception. In this case, it is an unsuccessful attempt, as evidenced by the man’s following up, after a pause, with “I think. ” Shapiro sees this as one example of self-deceptive speech, a kind of speech that has several qualities that distinguish it from speech with typical communicative aims. Self-deceptive speech of this sort can be characterized by repetition (“I know I did the right thing! I know I did!”) and by surprising affective disconnects: either notably less affect in the saying than the content would typically warrant (e. g., speaking of being furious without any concomitant sign of anger), or alternatively what Shapiro describes as a melodramatic and <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> to the descriptions an...|$|R
