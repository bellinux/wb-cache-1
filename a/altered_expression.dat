25|$|Chromosomal rearrangements and <b>altered</b> <b>expression</b> of {{this gene}} have {{been implicated in}} several neurological, neoplastic, {{and other types of}} diseases, {{including}} Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, schwannoma, melanoma, and type I diabetes.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} study noted overexpression of QSER1 in pathological cardiomyopathy. This {{condition is}} associated with <b>altered</b> <b>expression</b> of genes involved in immune responses, signaling, cell growth, and proliferation as well as infiltration of B lymphocytes.|$|E

25|$|Germ line {{mutations}} in DNA repair genes cause only 2â€“5% {{of colon cancer}} cases. However, <b>altered</b> <b>expression</b> of microRNAs, causing DNA repair deficiencies, are frequently associated with cancers and {{may be an important}} causal factor.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomena}} {{described above}} {{are dependent on}} changes at the cellular and molecular levels. <b>Altered</b> <b>expression</b> of ion channels, changes in neurotransmitters and their receptors as well as altered gene expression in response to neural input are at play.|$|E
25|$|<b>Altered</b> <b>expression</b> {{profiles}} in beta-catenin {{have been associated}} with dilated cardiomyopathy in humans. Beta-catenin upregulation of expression has generally been observed in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. In a particular study, patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy showed almost doubled estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) mRNA and protein levels, and the ER-alpha/beta-catenin interaction, present at intercalated discs of control, non-diseased human hearts was lost, suggesting that the loss of this interaction at the intercalated disc {{may play a role in}} the progression of heart failure.|$|E

50|$|Epstein-Barr virus, {{like other}} oncogenic viruses, {{decreases}} {{the expression of}} TLR9 in B cells, diminishing production of TNF and IL-6. EBV {{has been reported to}} <b>alter</b> <b>expression</b> of TLR9 at the transcription, translation, and protein level.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{there are}} many {{findings}} of <b>altered</b> gene <b>expression</b> and epigenetics, but both of these {{can also be a}} secondary result of, for example, environmental factors and altered metabolism. Examples of <b>altered</b> gene <b>expression</b> include that of miRNAs.|$|R
25|$|A strong {{association}} {{has been identified}} between miR-569 and 3q26.2, a chromosomal locus that is amplified in some breast cancers. <b>Altered</b> <b>expression</b> of the miR-569 gene has been demonstrated to affect growth and proliferation of breast epithelial cells. Ectopic expression of miR-569 resulted in tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. This occurs through miR-569 inhibition of TP53INP1, a tumor suppressor gene. In comparison to normal tissues and less malignant tumors, TP53INP1 occurs at lower levels in more invasive cancers, presumably {{in part due to}} the role played by miR-569.|$|E
500|$|<b>Altered</b> <b>expression</b> or {{modification}} of CASS4 {{has been proposed}} as relevant to several human pathologies, typically based on detection of changes in CASS4 in high throughput screening, although the role of CASS4 in the pathology of these conditions {{has not yet been}} studied directly. [...] These findings are summarized in Table 1; some examples are provided below.|$|E
500|$|Altered (typically elevated) {{expression}} of NEDD9 is {{strongly associated with}} cancer. NEDD9 is rarely if ever mutated, but frequently show <b>altered</b> <b>expression</b> or phosphorylation (associated with increased activity) in pathological conditions including immune cell dysfunction and cancer. [...] NEDD9 overexpression is documented to occur {{and in some cases}} linked the process of tumorigenesis of many different malignances. [...] Besides examples in breast cancer discussed above, these malignancies include colon, pancreatic, head and neck, ovarian, gastric, lung, genitourinary (including prostate), liver, and kidney cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, glioblastoma, and neuroblastoma.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{morphine}} can <b>alter</b> the <b>expression</b> {{of a number of}} genes.

We show that both viable and heat-inactivated Staphylococcus aureus and lipoteichoic acid differentially <b>alter</b> <b>expression</b> of these peptides upon contact with human keratinocytes. The findings indicate a diversity of staphylococcal factors involved in upregulation of antimicrobial peptide expression in cutaneous epithelia...|$|R
2500|$|Interaction of QSER1 with SUMO {{has been}} {{confirmed}} in multiple studies. The role of SUMOylation in QSER1 function is unclear. However, {{there may be a}} connection between QSER1 and SUMO in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (often caused by accumulation of misfolded proteins). In a study on ER stress, QSER1 was tagged as an ER stress response gene with <b>altered</b> <b>expression.</b> [...] Further, in a study on SUMOylation in response to accumulated misfolded proteins and ER stress found QSER1 to be a SUMO interactant in this situation. Any connection between these two activities is unstudied and unconfirmed.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Altered</b> <b>expression</b> of QSER1 {{is noted}} in {{pathological}} cardiomyopathy, Burkitt's Lymphoma, prostate cancer, and some breast cancers mentioned above. NCBI AceView lists multiple mutations associated with other pathologies including an eight base pair and 13 base pair deletion in QSER1 associated with leiomyosarcoma of the uterus, and 57 base pair {{difference in a}} neuroblastoma. Also listed are multiple splice variants with truncated 5' and/or 3' ends often noted in cancerous conditions. [...] Further, according to the NCBI OMIM database, multiple pathologies are associated with alterations in the 11p13 region and therefore may implicate QSER1. These include Exudative Vitreoretinopathy 3, Familial Candidiasis 3, Centralopathic Epilepsy, and Autosomal Recessive Deafness 51.|$|E
2500|$|In vertebrates, the {{majority}} of gene promoters contain a CpG island with numerous CpG sites. [...] When many of a gene's promoter CpG sites are methylated the gene becomes inhibited (silenced). [...] Colorectal cancers typically have 3 to 6 driver mutations and 33 to 66 hitchhiker or passenger mutations. [...] However, transcriptional inhibition (silencing) may be of more importance than mutation in causing progression to cancer. [...] For example, in colorectal cancers about 600 to 800 genes are transcriptionally inhibited by CpG island methylation (see regulation of transcription in cancer). [...] Transcriptional repression in cancer can also occur by other epigenetic mechanisms, such as <b>altered</b> <b>expression</b> of microRNAs. [...] In breast cancer, transcriptional repression of BRCA1 may occur more frequently by over-expressed microRNA-182 than by hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter (see Low expression of BRCA1 in breast and ovarian cancers).|$|E

60|$|The {{first act}} was almost over before the heroine of the play, and the actress {{concerning}} whose merits {{there was already}} some difference of opinion, appeared. A little burst of applause, half-hearted from the house generally, enthusiastic from a few, greeted her entrance. Ellison, watching his companion's face closely, was gratified to find a distinct change there. In Matravers' <b>altered</b> <b>expression</b> was something more than the transitory sensation of pleasure, called up by the unexpected appearance of a very beautiful woman. The whole impassiveness of that calm, almost marble-still face, with its set, cold lips, and slightly wearied eyes, had suddenly disappeared, and what Ellison had hoped for had arrived. Matravers was, without doubt, interested.|$|E
5000|$|When {{microglia}} are activated {{they take}} on an amoeboid shape and they <b>alter</b> their gene <b>expression.</b> <b>Altered</b> gene <b>expression</b> leads {{to the production of}} numerous potentially neurotoxic mediators. These mediators are important in the normal functions of microglia and their production is usually decreased once their task is complete. In chronic neuroinflammation, microglia remain activated for an extended period during which the production of mediators is sustained longer than usual. [...] This increase in mediators contributes to neuronal death.|$|R

Since elevated expression of OsNPF 7.2 is capable of improving rice grain yield, this gene might be applied to high-yield rice breeding.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{purpose of}} this review is to discuss recent studies {{reporting}} {{on the influence of}} fatty acids on gene expression in relation to inflammation and immune responses. RECENT FINDINGS: Saturated fatty acids promote, whereas several n- 3 fatty acids, in particular eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, some isomers of conjugated linoleic acid, and punicic acid suppress, expression of inflammatory genes. The most common targets of fatty acids are genes encoding cytokines, chemokines, cyclooxygenase, nitric oxide synthase, and matrix metalloproteinases. The anti-inflammatory actions of fatty acids often involve inhibition of activation of nuclear factor-?B and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ? and ?. Common upstream events include actions on Toll-like receptors and via G-protein coupled receptors. Fatty acids can influence expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory cell development and differentiation. Recent studies using genome-wide analyses demonstrate that dietary fatty acids can <b>alter</b> <b>expression</b> of a large number (many hundreds) of genes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. SUMMARY: A wide range of fatty acids <b>alter</b> <b>expression</b> of genes involved in development, differentiation, and function of cells involved in inflammation and immunity. <br/...|$|R
