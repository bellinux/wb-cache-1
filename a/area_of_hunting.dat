5000|$|According to Ernst Knauf, [...] "El Shaddai" [...] means [...] "God of the Wilderness" [...] and {{originally}} {{would not}} have had a doubled [...] "d". He argues that it is a loan-word from [...] "Israelian" [...] Hebrew, where the word had a [...] "sh", into [...] "Judaen (and hence, Biblical) Hebrew", where it would have been [...] "śaday" [...] with the sound śin. In this theory, the word is related to the word [...] "sadé" [...] meaning [...] "the (uncultivated) field", the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>hunting</b> (as in the distinction between beasts of the field, חיות השדה, and cattle, בהמות). He points out that the name is found in Thamudic inscriptions (as 'lšdy), in a personal name Śaday`ammī used in Egypt from the Late Bronze Age till Achaemenid times, and even in the Punic name `bdšd' (Servant of Shadé or Shada).|$|E
5000|$|Eastern Woodland {{communities}} {{vary widely}} in whether they divide labor based on sex. In general, {{like in the}} Plains nations, women own the home while men's work may involve more travel. Northern tribes like the Algonquian had a tendency for all members to be nomadic at times. Narragansett men traditionally help clear the fields and cultivate the crops and assist with the harvesting, whereas women hold authority in the home. Among the Lenape, {{men and women have}} both participated in agriculture and hunting according to age and ability, although primary leadership in agriculture traditionally belongs to women, while men have more responsibility in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>hunting.</b> Whether gained by hunting, fishing or agriculture, older Lenape women take responsibility for community food distribution. Land management, whether used for hunting or agriculture, also is the traditional responsibility of Lenape women.|$|E
50|$|Bansalan was {{a forest}} primeval and the aborigines were Bagobos. As they were nomadic, they {{traveled}} {{from one place}} to the other by hacking their way through the virgin forests. They also cultivated land for their staple food but soon left the place after harvest time in search of a better place to cultivate. They also had the wide <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>hunting</b> ground where {{at the end of the}} day, they brought home speared wild boar, deer or monkeys. The implements they had were crude but obviously the bow and arrow were used both in hunting and fishing. The waters then were crystal pure and were untarnished by the changing current ecology. In some certain sites, Bansalan had patches of cogonal land interspersed with tall trees demarcated by serene creeks and turbulent rivers gushing from the belly of Mount Apo, the highest mountain peak in the Philippines where according to legend, Apo Sandawa ruled as god.|$|E

40|$|The {{area around}} the Gulf of Bothnia is a {{distinct}} region with historic roots. In 1809, after the peace treaty at Fredrikshamn, the area was divided into a Swedish and a Finnish (Russian) part through a new border on the Torne River. Earlier the whole area {{on both sides of}} the Gulf, in Sweden as well as in Finland, belonged to the same taxation district and was subject to the same taxes based on winter hunting and summer harvesting. The cultural landscape in this region can be seen in cadastral maps from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In the villages, which were large compared to those in other places in Sweden and Finland, the same division of the arable land can be seen in the Torne river valley in the west as in the eastern coastal area to Kronoby in the south. South of the Torne river valley traces of this land organisation can be seen on the early maps. This land organisation had social causes depending on the main industry in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>hunting</b> and fishing. The roots of both social organisation and early taxation lay in the east as opposed to most areas in Sweden and Finland, in which a westerly influence dominated...|$|E
40|$|How {{could we}} {{understand}} the phenomenon of hunting today? If we consider bioethics as the emerging area through which {{we want to give}} meaning to the role of human being towards his/her societal dimension as well as to all forms of life, it seems reasonable to assume that phenomenon of hunting should not stay out of our considerations. In the beginning we are faced with two very ambivalent positions: even though human was 90 % of his/her history a hunter and gatherer, today hunting seems unnecessary rudiment of the past, since the hunting activity is understood as expression of direct killing and the supremacy of man over many life forms. But at the same time hunting {{is one of the most}} successful tools to control the population of certain animal species, which as a result of human intervention has come into a situation of imbalance. In addition, many theorists suggest contemporary lifestyle of post-industrial society in many ways denaturalize human while destroying the natural dimension of human existence, reducing it to a cognitive and sensitive flawed creature. Here we refer to the idea of the Spanish philosopher J. Ortega y Gasset who, in his famous writings Meditations on Hunting, wants to reach the deepest sense of the human being, and says that the hunting was that retrieving mechanism. In the end, in this bioethical survey we try to outline the problematic <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>hunting</b> while determining the appropriate measure of its existence within contemporary society...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to asses the early {{mortality}} rate of roe deer fawns due to mowing in a forest-agriculture mosaic landscape, {{and to find out}} which type of mowing and in which time period the major number of fawns are killed by mowers and whether simple scaring devices can decrease the mortality rate due to mowing. In the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hunting</b> ground Kajuh in the village of Šmartno v Rožni dolini, we chose 100 farms. Thirty-three randomly selected farms (preventive group) set simple scaring devices in order to reduce fawn mortality, whereas the rest of the farms (control group) did not set any scaring devices. The scaring device consisted of a black sack attached to a 1. 80 m long pole. These poles had to be placed in a field that was about to be mown 24 hours before mowing, one pole per hectare. During our research 13 roe deer fawns were killed by mowers. The highest rate of mortality was perceived in the beginning {{and in the middle of}} June, that is 4. 5 fawns per 100 ha. Twelve fawns were killed by tractor mowers and one by a sickle mower. The control group suffered a loss of 3. 3 fawns per 100 ha of mowed meadows and the preventive group 2 fawns per 100 ha. Our conclusion was that simple scaring devices had decreased the mortality rate of roe deer fawns, but to a lesser degree than expected, though it is true that the farmers did not always set the scaring devices according to our instructions...|$|E

There is also an economic analysis of revenues and expenses regarding hunting rights in these hunting grounds.

The conducted research confirmed the existence of two types <b>of</b> <b>hunting</b> grounds that differ by the kind of ownership and also revenues and expenses regarding hunting rights in these hunting lands. It was further found out that the diminishing <b>of</b> the minimum <b>area</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hunting</b> grounds would increase the bindingness <b>of</b> the <b>hunting</b> rights with the ownership <b>of</b> the <b>hunting</b> lands.
