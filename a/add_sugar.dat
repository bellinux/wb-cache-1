The high sugar level was characteristic of people's tastes at the time, and Jeandet explained that it was common for people in the 19th century, such as Russians, to <b>add</b> <b>sugar</b> to their wine at dinner.

40|$|Consumption of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> in Canada {{is often}} {{reported}} {{to be higher than}} data suggest. Both popular and scientific articles often incorrectly report unadjusted national food supply (availability) data as actual consumption data. Additionally, when describing Canadian eating habits, US data is often cited. This does not provide an accurate reflection of Canadian consumption patterns, as Canadian intakes of many foods and beverages containing <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> are substantially below US levels (1). Misinformation about <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> consumption may be linked to complications associated with their estimation.

25|$|After fermentation, the must is {{normally}} high in malic acid and producers {{will put the}} wine through malolactic fermentation to soften the wine. The process of chaptalization, adding sugar to the grape must to boost alcohol levels, has been a controversial issue for Beaujolais winemakers. Historically, Beaujolais producers would pick grapes at ripeness that were at minimum potential alcohol levels of 10-10.5% and then <b>add</b> <b>sugar</b> in order to artificially boost the alcohol levels to the near the maximum of 13-13.5%. This created wines lacking structure and balance {{to go with the}} high alcohol body and mouthfeel. The recent trend towards higher quality wine production has limited the use of chaptalization in the premium levels of Beaujolais wine. Filtering the wine in order to stabilize it is practiced to varying degrees by Beaujolais winemakers. Some producers who make Beaujolais on a large commercial scale will filter the wine aggressively to avoid any impurity or future chemical reactions. This can have the negative side effect of diminishing some of the wine's unique fruit character and leave a flavor that critics have described as Jell-O-like.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundReducing <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake {{is one of}} the Healthy People 2020 objectives. High <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake may be {{associated}} with adverse health consequences. ObjectiveThis cross-sectional study identified sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics associated with <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake among US adults (18 years and older) using the 2010 National Health Interview Survey data (n= 24, 967). MethodsThe outcome variable was <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake from foods and beverages using scoring algorithms to convert dietary screener frequency responses on nine items to estimates of individual dietary intake of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> in teaspoons per day. Added sugars intake was categorized into tertiles (lowest, middle, highest) stratified by sex. The explanatory variables were sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios for the highest and middle tertile <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake groups as compared with the lowest tertile group. ResultsEstimated median <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake was 17. 6 tsp/d for men and 11. 7 tsp/d for women. For men and women, those who had significantly greater odds for being in the highest tertile of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake (men: 22 ̆ 030522. 0 tsp/d; women: 22 ̆ 030514. 6 tsp/d) were younger, less educated, had lower income, were less physically active, were current smokers, and were former or current infrequent/light drinkers, whereas non-Hispanic other/multiracial and those living in the West had significantly lower odds for being in the highest tertile of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake. Different patterns were found by sex. Non-Hispanic black men had lower odds for being in the highest tertile of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> intake, whereas non-Hispanic black women had greater odds for being in the highest tertile.

2500|$|The {{first record}} of tea in English {{came from a}} letter written by Richard Wickham, who ran an East India Company office in Japan, writing to a {{merchant}} in Macao requesting [...] "the best sort of chaw" [...] in 1615. Peter Mundy, a traveller and merchant who came across tea in Fujian in 1637, wrote, [...] "chaa — only water {{with a kind of}} herb boyled in it [...] ". Tea was sold in a coffee house in London in 1657, Samuel Pepys tasted tea in 1660, and Catherine of Braganza took the tea-drinking habit to the British court when she married Charles II in 1662. Tea, however, was not widely consumed in Britain until the 18th century, and remained expensive until the latter part of that period. British drinkers preferred to <b>add</b> <b>sugar</b> and milk to black tea, and black tea overtook green tea in popularity in the 1720s. Tea smuggling during the 18th century led to the general public being able to afford and consume tea. The British government removed the tax on tea, thereby eliminating the smuggling trade by 1785. In Britain and Ireland, tea was initially consumed as a luxury item on special occasions, such as religious festivals, wakes, and domestic work gatherings. The price of tea in Europe fell steadily during the 19th century, especially after Indian tea began to arrive in large quantities; by the late 19th century tea had become an everyday beverage for all levels of society. The popularity of tea also informed a number of historical events – the Tea Act of 1773 provoked the Boston Tea Party that escalated into the American Revolution, and the need {{to address the issue of}} British trade deficit caused by the demand for Chinese tea led to a trade in opium that resulted in the Opium Wars.|$|E

The American Heart Association (AHA) diet is designed to prevent and treat MetS; however, it remains unclear whether the AHA diet is effective on decreasing <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> consumption. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of the AHA dietary counselling on <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> consumption among participants with MetS. METHODS: The AHA dietary counselling was conducted among 119 participants with MetS from June 2009 to January 2014 (ClinicalTrials. gov: NCT 00911885). Unannounced 24 -hour recalls were collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Added sugar consumption patterns over time were examined using linear mixed models. RESULTS: After 1 -year dietary counselling, intake of <b>added</b> <b>sugars</b> decreased by 23. 8 g/day (95 % CI 15. 1, 32. 4 g/day); intake of nonalcoholic beverages dropped from the leading contributor of <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> intake to number 7 (from 11. 9 to 4. 4 %); the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) score increased by 5. 4 (95 % CI 2. 9, 8. 0); however, <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> intake for 48 % participants still exceeded the recommendation. Added sugar intake per meal among different meal type was similar (24. 2 - 25. 8 %) at baseline. After the 1 -year dietary counselling, breakfast became the major resource of <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> intake (33. 3 %); the proportion of <b>added</b> <b>sugar</b> intake from snacks decreased from 25. 8 % (CI 23. 1, 28. 5 %) to 20. 9 % (CI 19. 6, 22. 3 %).
