Bots can be further customized by changing attributes such as names, appearance, and weapon preferences. In team matches, players can give orders to bots on their team. The PC version supports multiplayer mode over the internet or a local area network (the original Unreal was mainly a single-player game).|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the {{transport}} authorities of Oslo decided to close Nordberg and Frøen stations, {{on the grounds}} that these stations were too expensive to maintain. The platforms at Vestgrensa were moved a few metres to <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> metro trains. Seven years later, on 22 August 1999, Vestgrensa was closed and replaced with the newly opened Forskningsparken Station.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1941, Hitler {{launched}} Operation Barbarossa, {{the invasion}} of the Soviet Union.

5|$|Apart from {{changes in}} the legal {{specifications}} of the shades of the national colors (see the section below), the basic design of the Polish flag, including the 5:8 ratio, has remained unchanged to this day. The flag with coat of arms was only modified to <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{changes in the}} coat of arms itself. Major modifications included {{a change in the}} stylization of the eagle from Classicist to Baroque in 1927 and the removal of the crown from the eagle's head during the Communist rule from 1944 to 1990. In that period, Poland {{was one of the few}} socialist states in the Eastern Bloc (apart from the Flag of Cuba) not to adorn communist symbolism on its flag.|$|E
5|$|Darabont's {{departure}} as showrunner in July 2011 {{during the}} second season came as surprise to many, as it came shortly after the season's premiere {{and a few days}} after that year's Comic-Con, where Darabont helped to promote the show. It was speculated that he was unable to <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> schedule of running a television series. However, The Hollywood Reporter reported that AMC had fired him. There had been reported difficulties in the production of the second season, including disputes over planned budget cuts and executive meddling, and it was known that Darabont and AMC had several discussions relating to these factors. However, neither Darabont, AMC, nor the cast nor crew of The Walking Dead spoke about the reasons for his firing.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Brooks is paroled {{after serving}} 50 years, but he cannot <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outside world, and he commits suicide by hanging himself. Andy {{receives}} a library donation {{that includes a}} recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, earning a spell in solitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains that hope is what gets him through his time, a concept that Red dismisses. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias Randall Stephens.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, the Browns drafted Brian Sipe, giving Gault {{competition}} for the third quarterback spot, which was noted as a main position battle in training camp for the Browns that season. At the end of training camp, Sipe won the job, and Gault was cut. He {{was picked up by}} the San Diego Chargers in late August. He competed with Wayne Clark for the backup quarterback job for a short time, and did not see any playing time for the Chargers before his release. He also spent time with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, but did not see any playing time with them. He later noted that he was unable to <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game of Canadian football, as he was unable to throw a spiral due to the football being shorter and fatter.|$|E
5|$|Led by Kent Nilsson's 49-goal, 131-point season, the Flames {{qualified}} for the playoffs in their first season in Calgary with a 39–27–14 record, good for third in the Patrick Division. The team found much greater playoff success in Calgary {{than it did in}} Atlanta, winning their first two playoff series over the Chicago Black Hawks and Philadelphia Flyers before bowing out to the Minnesota North Stars in the semi-finals. This early success was not soon repeated. After a losing record in 1981–82, Fletcher jettisoned several holdovers from the Atlanta days who could not <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> higher-pressure hockey environment and rebuilt the roster. Over the next three seasons, he put together a core of players that would remain together through the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{wished to}} retire to Castile {{and live with}} her {{recently}} widowed sister Eleanor, near Charles, who had retired. She was afraid of moving to Castile because, although her mentally unstable mother Joanna (who died aged 77 in April 1555) had been sovereign there, Mary had never lived in Castile. She was afraid that Eleanor's death would leave her alone in a country whose customs she did not know. In the end, she {{decided to move to}} Castile, while retaining the possibility of moving back to the Netherlands in case she could not <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Castilian customs. Charles, Eleanor, and Mary sailed from Ghent on 15 September 1556.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only have}} the {{symbionts}} and specific species been shown to shift, {{but there seems to}} be a certain growth rate favorable to selection. Slower-growing but more heat-tolerant corals have become more common. The changes in temperature and acclimation are complex. Some reefs in current shadows represent a refugium location that will help them <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disparity in the environment even if eventually the temperatures may rise more quickly there than in other locations. This separation of populations by climatic barriers causes a realized niche to shrink greatly in comparison to the old fundamental niche.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, Burke {{signed a}} maximum rookie contract—120 {{percent of the}} preset salary scale of $2,032,300—with the Jazz, {{resulting}} in a contract worth in $4,987,320 guaranteed salary for his first two seasons, while the Jazz have team option rights for {{the third and fourth}} years. This cleared the way for Burke to participate in the July 7–12 Orlando Summer League. At point guard, the Jazz had traded Randy Foye and were negotiating with Mo Williams. In the NBA Summer League, Trey Burke shot at 24 percent from the field, including 1–19 on three-point shots, while trying to <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pace of the NBA game. He was even benched for a game. Following Burke's Summer League performance, the Jazz signed John Lucas III.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine {{joined the}} Spurs for the 2002–03 NBA season, {{where he played}} backup for veteran guard Steve Smith. He {{spent much of the}} early season injured, and found it hard to <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NBA's style of play. As his injury improved, so did Ginóbili, winning the Western Conference Rookie of the Month in March, and being named to the All-Rookie Second Team {{at the end of the}} season. Still, he only started in five games as the Spurs chalked up a 60–22 regular season win–loss record. The Spurs then entered the playoffs eager to upend the {{defending}} champions Los Angeles Lakers, at which point Ginóbili rose to prominence.|$|E

5|$|The {{designs of}} most of these flags have been {{modified}} only to <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> changes in the official rendering of the national coat of arms. Major modifications included {{a change in the}} stylization of the eagle from Neoclassicist to Baroque in 1927 and the removal of the crown from the eagle's head during the Communist rule from 1944 to 1990. Legal specification for the shades of the national colors has also changed with time. The shade of red was first legally specified as vermilion by a presidential decree of 13 December 1928.|$|E
5|$|This {{is one of}} {{the last}} episodes of The Walking Dead to feature Darabont as an {{executive}} producer and the showrunner. In July2011 he stepped down as showrunner. Initial reports suggested that he was unable to <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> schedule of running a television series, but it was later confirmed that he was fired because of the show's reduced budget and his strained relationship with the executives of AMC. In addition to the main cast, Melissa McBride reprised her role as Carol Peletier, IronE Singleton reprised his role as T-Dog, and Madison Lintz reprised her role as Sophia Peletier. All three were promoted to the recurring cast, as was Norman Reedus.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{participated in}} the Rangers' {{training}} camp that preceded the 2013–14 season, during which he impressed New York's head coach Alain Vigneault, and head European scout Anders Hedberg. Although {{it was his first}} North American professional training camp, Fast made the Rangers roster, partially because the team needed a right-handed shot to replace the injured captain Ryan Callahan. Fast made his NHL debut on October 3 against the Phoenix Coyotes, taking one shot on goal in 10:13 of ice time. Fast played in eight of the Rangers' first 10 games of the season, playing on the fourth line and recording no points and a -5 plus-minus, before returning to the AHL to make room for Carl Hagelin's return from a shoulder injury. Observers said Fast needed to <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> smaller North American ice surface, and did not get sufficient minutes to do so quickly enough to remain in the NHL.|$|E
