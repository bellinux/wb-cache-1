The approach reduces signaling traffic for messages that are sent to several recipients. It is based on signaling messages that include location <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> each <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> the message. Therefore, they can be delivered to all re-cipients efficiently, instead of sending the message to each destination separately in a turn. We applied this approach on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), which is a widely used signaling protocol in IP networks. To support the approach, a SIP request {{must be able to}} include SIP Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) <b>of</b> several <b>recipients.</b> Such a SIP request we call multi-recipient request. We also present the results of sim-ulations that show the signaling traffic generated with and without multi-recipient requests.

In this paper we explore an approach to intra-enterprise ABM based on providing access control and confidentiality using information from the same attribute database exploited by the addressing scheme. We show how to address three key challenges. First, we demonstrate a manageable access control system based on attributes. Second, we demonstrate use of Attribute Based Encryption to provide endto-end confidentiality. Third, we show that such a system can be efficient enough to support ABM for mid-size enterprises.

About half of these secular cantatas were written to celebrate a person’s birthday. This thesis will attempt to provide {{a view of the}} life of the historical figures for which the birthday cantatas were written, reflections of the personality of the individual in the cantata, Bach’s relationship to the recipient, and political or social connotations associated with the work. From a study of the individuals connected with the musical work, a more thorough understanding of the time period in which Bach lived and worked may be gained.

40|$|For over a half-century, the U. S. Department of Energy {{nuclear weapons}} {{laboratory}} in Livermore, California {{has worked with}} plutonium {{in the course of}} its mission to research and develop nuclear weapons. Plutonium releases via the Laboratory’s sewer system resulted in the contamination of sewage sludge that was distributed and used widely as soil conditioner in parks, landscaping around public buildings, and in home lawns and gardens. The amount of sludge distributed and the concentration of the radioactivity in the sludge are uncertain. In 1999, research was undertaken to investigate the historic distribution of sewage sludge (1958 - 1976) in Livermore. Navigating the uncertainties surrounding the sludge distribution more than forty years after it began presented an enormous ethical challenge. Community members who received the sludge at no cost were not told that the sludge they received may have been contaminated with plutonium, and the log-book that had recorded the names and <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> sludge <b>recipients</b> had disappeared.

50|$|The window permits text on {{the letter}} itself to be used {{simultaneously}} as the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>recipient</b> and the return-address of the sender, reducing the need to print the addresses onto the envelope itself, {{which at the time}} of Callahan's invention was done {{with the aid of a}} typewriter. This arguably amounts to a savings in materials, particularly through the reduction in ink usage; but on the other hand the window has to be cut out and sometimes replaced by an additional material called a patch (originally glassine but now plastic). This makes the envelope more expensive. There is also the argument that the paper of the envelope can be substituted with lesser-quality paper as the envelope no longer must be written upon.; this perhaps was more relevant at the time of Callahan's invention but is a somewhat specious claim today. Over time the quality of paper generally has improved. Satisfactorily-strong envelopes for business and general-purpose domestic correspondence can be, and are, in fact made out of paper of various qualities. In Britain by the 1940s, during World War 2, envelopes were made out of newspaper because of the paper shortage.|$|R
