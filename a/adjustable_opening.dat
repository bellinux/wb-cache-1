Vehicles with mechanical ventilation systems (F-vehicles) had pressure fans in combination with <b>adjustable</b> <b>openings</b> in front, sides and back. F-vehicles were winter configured by turning the fans off and increasing the natural ventilation (FN-vehicles). The naturally ventilated vehicles (N-vehicles) had <b>adjustable</b> <b>openings</b> in front, back and sides of the vehicle. Tarpaulin vehicles (K-vehicles) were Danish vehicles constructed with solid roof and front, and detachable tarpaulin sides for summer and winter configurations. All broilers were mechanically harvested. Long term investigations {{were performed}} on transport documentations from 2, 310 Swedish vehicles during Oct. 2005 to Oct. 2006 (F- and FN-vehicles) and Apr. 2006 - Oct. 2006 (N-vehicles). The number of broilers dead on arrival (DOA) was 0. 14 % and 0. 39 % for F- and N-vehicles, respectively. Transport time up to 3. 5 h, ambient- and lorry temperature had no effects on DOA (R 2 = 0, 013), however a small increase was seen at ambient temperatures above 17 ºC (NS). Intensive studies of twenty three transports were performed during Jun. – Aug. 2006 and Dec. 2006 – Feb. 2007, where levels of temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide (CO 2) in containers at different locations of the vehicles were measured during loading and transit. Loading practise had an impact on temperature development in the F-vehicle and to reduce heat stress they should be loaded back to front. Keeping both sides of the vehicle open during loading was important to avoid increasing temperatures in the containers. In F-vehicles with fans turned off the internal climate becomes unstable, especially in the trailer. In N-vehicles during summer temperatures were high, exceeding 25 °C in the lower, central parts of the trailer. In these certain parts of the vehicle air flow needs to be increased. During transport large internal climatic differences were found between containers in both F- and N-vehicle. A calculated temperature-humidity index (THI) was at acute dangerous levels in certain containers. In N-vehicles the drawers’ construction was limiting ventilation. K-vehicles had the most acceptable climate during summer, but unstable during winter with risk for temperatures down to 0 °C. In conclusion, the ventilation system designs in the vehicles are crucial for appropriate climate control and are in several cases in need of revising or reconstruction...|$|R

30|$|Plunging hollow jet aerator {{consists}} of a conical-shaped surface device that spreads water emerging out from the outlet of a discharging pipe into the atmosphere, thus forming a hollow jet issued at the exit end of pipe.

The jet goes on diverging as it advances and impinges on the water in the pool gradually sucking some of the air present in the space within the hollow jet and thus creates a large turbulence in the water in the pool. The aerator is installed at the pipe outlet with a centering and fixing arrangement such that the aerator remains co-axial with the pipe. The annular opening between the exit end of pipe and the aerator, making the aerator move upward and downward, can be adjusted by upward/downward movement of the aerator.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to the ongoing liquid metal spherical Couette experiments detailed above, a number of related experiments can also provide insights into dynamo action in an Earth-like geometry. The Princeton MRI experiment (Ji et al. 2006; Nornberg et al. 2010; Roach et al. 2012) is a Taylor-Couette liquid metal gallium experiment. With similar driving in a different geometry (shear between inner and outer cylindrical boundaries), its results can be useful for comparison with spherical Couette devices. The Madison Plasma Dynamo Experiment (Collins et al. 2012; Katz et al. 2012) has a whole-sphere geometry and uses plasma as the conducting medium. This allows it to access a different range in Re-Rm space, since the plasma’s Pm differs significantly from that of liquid metals. Moreover, the value of Pm is <b>adjustable,</b> <b>opening</b> up the possibility for new experimental investigations of the Pm dependence of flow dynamics. Also, the flow is driven from the outer boundary, with the experiment able to impose an arbitrary velocity profile at that location. Upcoming results from this experiment promise to be very interesting and should {{shed light on the}} prospects for dynamo action in a spherical geometry.|$|E

Upon ignition of a combustible item, a limited ventilation fire {{will result in the}} train car. In this paper, train car fire under limited ventilation will be studied experimentally by a scale model. A 1 / 15 scale model of a train car with <b>adjustable</b> <b>openings</b> was constructed. Five ventilation scenarios including 100 %, 75 %, 50 %, 25 % and 0 % of door area opened were investigated. A propanol pool fire with a large amount of fuel and a large burning area was used to represent parallel goods. The burning duration of the pool fire, air temperature, heat flux at ground level and gas concentration were measured in the experiment. Air temperature rise and flame shapes of the propanol pool fire burning under limited ventilation in the train car model were different from those of burning the pool fire in free space. When the opening area increased, the burning duration of the pool fire reduced but heat flux in the model increased. The flame shape oscillated in the train car model when burning under the ventilation scenario with a small opening area. Carbon dioxide concentration increased linearly with the decrease in oxygen concentration. When burning the pool fire in the model with all doors closed, blue flame was observed. The flame extinguished when oxygen concentration fell to 14 %. The average upper layer temperature in the model was from 300 °C to 500 °C.

40|$|Abstract: Tide gates are {{frequently}} placed at confluences of streams with tidal waters. These gates prevent tidal waters from inundating low-lying lands while allowing stream flows to drain during lower tidal stages. Traditional tide gates effectively preclude an estuarine environment upstream {{of the gate}} and often block native fish from entering these tributary streams. In recent years, {{a new generation of}} tide gates has been installed with the intent of improving fish passage and allowing a limited amount of tidal inflow into the stream to create a longitudinal transition from the marine to freshwater environment. This new generation of tide gate uses side-hinged doors that open wider to permit efficient outflow and produce slower water velocities to accommodate fish passage. These gates also allow a limited amount of tidal water to flow upstream. Inflow of tidal water is regulated to mute the peak tidal stage and preventing upstream tidal flooding. The muted tide is regulated by either: 1. a small <b>adjustable</b> <b>opening</b> that functions as an orifice and sized to prevent excessive tidal inflow, or 2. a mechanical float system that holds the gate open until the upstream stage reaches a predetermined threshold. Design of these muted tidal systems involves extensive hydraulic analysis to evaluate fish passage, prevent upstream tidal flooding, and create the desired estuarine conditions, including vegetation zonation. This presentation will illustrate the types of analysis and considerations employed with this new generation of tide gates. Two recently constructed tide gate replacements designed for passage of all life stages of Pacific anadromous salmonids will be used as case examples to highlight the design proces...|$|E

30|$|EXAMPLE 2 : A {{digital camera}} returns an image (Observation), with a spatial {{receptive}} field {{equal to the}} size of the aperture and a temporal receptive window equal to the shutter speed. The aperture is “the size of the <b>adjustable</b> <b>opening</b> inside the lens, which determines how much light passes through the lens to strike the image sensor” [64], and the shutter speed is “the amount of time the digital camera’s shutter remains open when capturing a photograph” [65]. The receptor of the camera is the image sensor, but the size of the aperture determines the actual portion of the image sensor that is stimulated during the production of an image. The shutter speed determines the duration of the image sensor’s exposure to light. It is acknowledged here that resolution has been defined in the literature (for example, [66]) as a function of imaging aperture and the wavelength of the light. This is the optical resolution (which has sometimes also been called spatial resolution). It is inversely correlated with aperture, and measures the shortest distance between two points on an image that can still be distinguished by the observer. However, in line with previous work [5, 67], the term ‘discrimination’ is reserved for the shortest distance between two points on an image that can still be distinguished by the observer (the optical resolution). Approximating spatial resolution (as defined in this work, see Section Introduction) with spatial receptive field intends to inform about a different notion, and tell instead about the portion of the observer which was stimulated while producing the observation. It also reflects intuition, namely: the larger the aperture, the smaller the optical resolution (smallest details the lens can resolve), and consequently the larger the amount of spatial detail in the final image (spatial resolution). Further examples of receptors for technical observers include thermistors (for medical digital thermometers), bulbs (for clinical mercury thermometers), telescopes (for laser altimeters), aneroid capsules (for pressure altimeters), bulbs (for psychrometers), to name a few.|$|E

40|$|Electrical {{apparatuses}} {{for use in}} potentially explosive gas atmospheres {{are required}} to be enclosed. There are two main requirements {{in the design of}} such enclosures. Firstly, they are required to withstand the pressure generated in an internal explosion. Secondly, any gap openings must be small enough to quench flames and to cool combustion products to prevent re-ignition of a surrounding explosive gas atmosphere. The largest gap opening that just prevents transmission of an internal explosion to a surrounding explosive gas atmosphere is called the maximum experimental safe gap (MESG). The MESG values is determined from standardised experiments. The purpose of the conducted experimental work was to investigate the influence of the gap material on the MESG value. Another aim was to find out if partial inertisation of the explosive gas influences the maximum experimental safe gap. The combustible gas used in the experiments was propane. The experiments were conducted in an apparatus with an interchangeable and <b>adjustable</b> gap <b>opening.</b> The gap materials tested was carbon steel, brass, aluminium and polyoxymethylene. The experiments with metal gaps show that the properties of the metals do not have a significant influence on the MESG value. However, a decrease of 0. 01 mm was achieved when a flame gap of brass was used, compared to the value obtained using a steel gap. Temperature measured above the orifice of the gap opening supports the finding. At equal gap opening, a higher temperature was measures above brass gaps than above steel gaps. An increase of the MESG was achieved by partial inertisation of the explosive gas atmosphere.

H 577 P BSE 2016 Ngvarious pagings :color illustrationsThe {{number of}} {{parallel}} traders has significantly increased in some railway and subway {{systems of the}} Fast East including Hong Kong. In recent years, {{it has been observed}} that passengers in Hong Kong not only travel with their handbags on trains {{as they did in the}} past 40 years since the commissioning of the city's subway system, but even get aboard with trolleys, suitcases, large luggage and parallel goods. Train cars are often packed with large luggage and parallel goods which include milk powder, electronic products, foods and drinks. The rising trend of parallel traders travelling on train cars with trolleys, suitcases, large luggage and parallel goods poses new fire hazards to the subway system. Although the subway company has imposed a maximum weight limit of 23 kg for the luggage of each passenger, the fire load is still large as more trolleys, suitcases, large luggage and parallel goods are carried on train cars. Any ignition of combustible suitcases, luggage or parallel goods in a train car may result in a ventilation limited fire. A 1 / 15 scale model of a train car with <b>adjustable</b> <b>openings</b> was constructed for a study on the fire phenomena in a train car under limited ventilation. The fire load of parallel goods was simulated by 10 ml propanol (the effective heat of combustion ΔHC,eff (in kJ/kg) of propanol is 30. 45 kJ/kg), which represents 27 kg (about the maximum weight limit) in reality. As the area and volume of the propanol containers can affect the heat release rate and fire duration respectively, two containers of different sizes, namely a 75 mm x 75 mm (5, 625 mm²) square pan and a 38 mm (1, 135 mm²) round container, were used to contain the same amount of propanol in the tests to analyse the differences in the flame colour, flame shape, temperature, oxygen concentration, heat flux, mass loss rate of fuel and burning duration of the pool fire in an environment with limited ventilation. Seven ventilation scenarios with various degrees of door openings ranging from 0 %, 20 %, 40 % (3 different positions), 80 % and 100 % were analysed. The fire phenomena which included steady burning, oscillating fire and ghosting flame in a train car under limited ventilation are also covered in the analysis. Another focus of the study was the fire hazards of using clean refrigerants in subway systems and train cars. What makes the use of clean refrigerants hazardous is that all clean refrigerants contain liquefied petroleum gas with 100 % alkanes having an explosive range between 2. 15 % and 9. 6 %. As propane, a constituent of clean refrigerants, is flammable and 1. 5 times heavier than air, the fire hazards arising from the use of clean refrigerants in subway systems and train cars should not be neglected. To study the phenomena of explosion, a Computational Fluid Dynamics software named Flame Acceleration Simulator was used to simulate three explosion scenarios at different time of diffusion and leakage rates. An enclosure of about 200 m³ used as an electrical and mechanical equipment room in a subway station with the installation of an ventilation and air-conditioning system was taken as an example to illustrate the possible explosion hazards of clean refrigerants. Coarse grid and fine grid simulations were carried out for a better understanding of the explosion phenomena in a compartment. Key aspects of the relevant fire safety standards and codes for subway systems and train cars were studied. Measures to mitigate the fire hazards were also discussed.

40|$|COMPET is a {{preclinical}} PET scanner aiming {{towards a}} high sensitivity, a high resolution and MRI compatibility by implementing a novel detector geometry. In this approach, long scintillating LYSO crystals {{are used to}} absorb the gamma-rays. To determine the point of interaction (P 01) between gamma-ray and crystal, the light exiting the crystals {{on one of the}} long sides is collected with wavelength shifters (WLS) perpendicularly arranged to the crystals. This concept has two main advantages: (1) The parallax error is reduced to a minimum and is equal for the whole field of view (FOV). (2) The P 01 and its energy deposit is known in all three dimension with a high resolution, allowing for the reconstruction of Compton scattered gamma-rays. Point (1) leads to a uniform point source resolution (PSR) distribution over the whole FOV, and also allows to place the detector close to the object being imaged. Both points (1) and (2) lead to an increased sensitivity and allow for both high resolution and sensitivity at the same time, while keeping a low number of readout channels. In total, COMPET incorporates 1080 readout channels (600 crystals, 480 WLS). It has an axial FOV of 80 mm and <b>adjustable</b> bore <b>opening</b> between 30 mm and 80 mm. It consists of four modules with five layers each. Simulations show a PSR of below I mm in the transaxial plane and a sensitivity of up to 16 % {{in the center of the}} FOV. The readout is based on time over threshold signals, sampled with an FPGA, which allows for the measurement of high event rates at the order of mega-counts per seconds. Its compact design and compatibility to high magnetic fields will allow to use it as an insert for an already existing MRI scanner. A first semi-layer with 12 WLS and 10 LYSO crystal was built and connected to the COMPET readout system.

40|$|In 2015, the Dutch {{government}} {{initiated the}} ‘longitudinal training dams pilot project’. With {{the help of}} longitudinal dams, a two-channel system is created in which the river is divided into a main and a side channel. A combination of an inlet and several openings between the dams allows water and sediment to be exchanged between the two channels. This is expected to influence the discharge (and sediment) distribution between the main and side channel. Understanding the hydraulic conditions {{and the impact of}} the regulatory inlet and opening crest heights is expected to improve the control strategy and future design of river interventions using the concept of longitudinal training dams. A one-dimensional (Matlab) and a two-dimensional (Delft 3 D-Flow) model are created for this research. Both schematize the two channels with dams and openings. The influence of several mechanisms, factors and dimensional design parameters on the discharge distribution is assessed. Additionally, using Delft 3 D-Flow, the detailed flow patterns around the inlet and openings are evaluated and the schematizing of the inlet as part of the local bed topography or by using subgrid weirs is compared. From the several model runs, the discharge distribution shows to be mainly controlled by differences in longitudinal water level slopes in both channels, caused by the combination of too short inlet and opening lengths. It is not influenced significantly by the placement of the longitudinal training dams in a river bend. For increased crest heights the flow conditions change from submerged to free-flowing. In submerged conditions the velocity magnitudes and flow angles atop the inlet and opening crests are shown to increase in downstream direction while for free-flowing conditions they remain nearly constant. The free-flowing conditions are well described by empirical relationships, while for submerged conditions an additional angle submergence coefficient is suggested to parameterize flow angles. After some modifications, which will be included in the new Delft 3 D-Flow software release, schematization as part of the bed topography and subgrid weirs both predict similar discharges (< 7 % relative difference). If interest is only given to water levels and discharge distributions, the use of subgrid weirs is recommended in Delft 3 D-Flow. For models assessing other river functions requiring local flow patterns or sediment transport, schematization as part of the bed topography is essential. However, by including the suggested parameterization for flow angles, the errors in flow angles for subgrid weir can be reduced significantly. From this research, the <b>adjustable</b> inlet and <b>opening</b> crest heights do not show a large influence on the discharge distribution (5 - 10 % difference). It mostly impacts the tipping point for submerged to free-flow conditions. In submerged conditions, the inlet crest height does reduce the specific discharge in the side channel, limits the transverse velocities in the main channel, and greatly influence the flow angles atop the crest. Besides the crest heights, the channel width and inlet length should also be included as adjustable parameters in the design or control strategy of new systems of longitudinal training dams...|$|R
