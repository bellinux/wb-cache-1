5|$|As state superintendent, Paulus helped {{introduce}} statewide assessment {{testing for}} grades 3, 5, 8, and 11 in 1991. Other education reforms introduced that year were the Certificate of Initial Mastery (CIM) and Certificate of Advanced Mastery (CAM) {{that were designed}} to replace the high school diploma in Oregon. These were optional programs which {{were part of a}} broader program that included issuing a report card outlining the progress as a state, <b>as</b> <b>required</b> <b>by</b> a law the state legislature passed in 1991. Paulus also supported school to work initiatives for reforming public education while in office, which were part of the 1991 reforms. At the time Paulus was one of only ten women in the nation to hold the top education position in their state. She left the office on January 4, 1999, after two terms. In 2007, the Oregon Legislature eliminated the optional certificates from schools in the state.|$|E
5|$|Declan McCullagh {{asserts that}} during the trial, the judge sealed the entire court file, forbade the defense from issuing subpoenas to witnesses, granted the {{prosecution}} significant latitude in making negative suggestions about Bell's character, and refused requests for a mistrial.

Following the conviction, Jim Bell renewed his attempts at firing his court-appointed lawyer, appealing his case to the Supreme Court, and filing civil lawsuits against those he alleges were involved in an orchestrated conspiracy to deny him a fair trial and an unbiased, court-appointed defense counsel; his targets included two judges, at least two prosecutors, and his former probation officers and defense attorneys.|$|E

5|$|In autumn 1229, Alice {{arrived in}} Acre, whereupon she laid {{claim to the}} Kingdom of Jerusalem against the infant Conrad, son of her niece, Isabella II, and Frederick.

The members of the High Court, who had recently pledged fealty to Conrad's father, rejected Alice's claim, emphasizing that Conrad was a minor. However, they sent their envoys to Frederick in Foggia, Italy, requesting that he send Conrad to the Holy Land within a year and a day. Frederick informed the envoys that he would do what he thought best in May 1230.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March, UB-6 {{departed}} Zeebrugge {{to patrol}} off the Mass lightship. Two days later, UB-6 entered Dutch territorial waters after Steckelberg made a navigational error, and ran aground {{at the mouth}} of the Maas River. Because the Netherlands was neutral during the war, and UB-6 did not leave Dutch territorial waters within 24 hours <b>as</b> <b>required</b> <b>by</b> international law, the submarine and her crew were interned by the Dutch. The Germans protested, but because UB-6s grounding was merely the result of an error and not because of distress, the Dutch could not release the submarine. UB-6 was taken to the port of Hellevoetsluis for internment, where, on 18 March, UB-6s crew scuttled her. The crew of UB-6 was interned for the duration of the war. After the end of the war, UB-6s wreck was surrendered to France, taken to Brest, and broken up in July 1921.|$|E
