500|$|... "Diwali" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics.

[...] Sciannamea concluded that it was [...] "a terrific episode. The scenes inside the hall were hysterical, especially the dancing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Ah, {{there is}} a slit in this one,' cried the servant, shaking the skin; 'and here he is.' <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> out Ball-Carrier, looking so lean and small that he would hardly have made a mouthful for a sparrow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Me {{not able}} to get away before," [...] she said. [...] "In de first place me hab to wait till boy come back wid answer. Here 'tis," [...] <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> a small pellet of paper from her hair.|$|E

6000|$|... "I want {{to offer}} my {{services}} in the trial. I've got an idea. Why couldn't I go {{on the stand and}} swear I was there, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> the gun first and he wrestled with her and the gun went off accidentally?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Maxwell laughed, as {{she meant}} him, at the mock heroics of her phrase, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>pulled</b> off his hat, {{and rubbed his}} hair round on his skull in exultation at having arrived at some clear understanding. [...] "I wouldn't have hair like silk," [...] she jeered.|$|E

And suddenly - her jaw extends <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>pulls</b> his head into her mouth, then lifts him into the air and swallows him whole, vomiting up his shredded clothes.

6000|$|That roused the woman. <b>She</b> {{stood up}} <b>and</b> sneered at the Senior Subaltern for a cur, and abused the Major and the Colonel {{and all the}} rest.
