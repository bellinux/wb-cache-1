5|$|Items 77–81 in {{the code}} have been {{interpreted}} as {{a description of a}} woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation. These clauses define how much of the household goods <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> keep in different circumstances, depending on whether she keeps custody of the children, for example. It has recently been suggested, however, that it would be more correct to interpret these clauses as referring to women who are widowed, rather than divorced.|$|E
5|$|After their {{trips to}} the Himalaya, the Workmans gave lectures about their travels. They were invited to learned societies; Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne and the second {{to speak at the}} Royal Geographical Society. She {{received}} many medals of honor from European climbing and geographical societies and was {{recognized as one of the}} foremost climbers of her day. She demonstrated that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> climb in high altitudes just as well as a man and helped break down the gender barrier in mountaineering.|$|E
5|$|Pedro Afonso's {{death from}} fever {{at the age}} of one devastated the Emperor, and the {{imperial}} couple had no further children. Pedro Afonso's older sister Dona Isabel became heiress, but PedroII was unconvinced that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> ever be accepted as monarch by the ruling elite. He excluded Isabel from matters of state and failed to provide training for her possible role as empress. With no surviving male children, the Emperor started to believe that the imperial line was destined to end with his own death.|$|E

50|$|During World War I, {{in colonial}} Philippines, U.S. armed forces {{developed}} a prostitute management program called American Plan which enable {{the military to}} arrest any women within five miles of a military cantonment.If found infected, <b>a</b> <b>women</b> <b>could</b> be sentenced to a hospital or a farm colony until cured.|$|R
50|$|Ignatiev {{states that}} {{attempts}} to give race a biological foundation have only led to absurdities, as in the common example that <b>a</b> white <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> {{give birth to a}} black child, but <b>a</b> black <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> never give birth to a white child. Ignatiev asserts that the only logical explanation for this notion is that people are members of different racial categories because society assigns people to these categories.|$|R
5|$|In the Emperor's eyes, {{the deaths}} of his sons seemed to presage {{the end of the}} {{imperial}} system. His younger son had represented his future and that of the monarchy. Although the Emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, he had little confidence that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> rule Brazil in the male-dominated social climate of the time. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class. The lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation in promoting the imperial office as a position to be carried on by his descendants; he increasingly saw the imperial system as so inextricably linked to himself that it could not survive him.|$|E
5|$|Queen Adelaide {{attended}} the dying William devotedly, {{not going to}} bed herself {{for more than ten}} days. William IV died {{in the early hours of}} the morning of 20 June 1837 at Windsor Castle, where he was buried. As he had no living legitimate issue, the Crown of the United Kingdom passed to Princess Victoria of Kent, the only child of Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent, George III's fourth son. Under Salic Law, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> not rule Hanover, and so the Hanoverian Crown went to George III's fifth son, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland. William's death thus ended the personal union of Britain and Hanover, which had persisted since 1714. The main beneficiaries of his will were his eight surviving children by Mrs. Jordan. Although William IV is not the direct ancestor of the later monarchs of the United Kingdom, he has many notable descendants through his illegitimate family with Mrs. Jordan, including former Prime Minister David Cameron, TV presenter Adam Hart-Davis, author and statesman Duff Cooper, and the first Duke of Fife, who married Queen Victoria's granddaughter Louise.|$|E
5|$|The prince's {{early death}} (and the later demise of his younger brother) had an {{enormous}} impact on PedroII: on a personal level, on his future conduct as monarch, and on the empire. In his eyes, the deaths of his only sons seemed to presage the end of the imperial system. Although the emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, in the male-dominated society of the time he had little confidence that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> rule Brazil. He was fond and respectful of the women in his life, but he did not consider it feasible that Isabel could survive as monarch. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class.|$|E

50|$|Hogg caused {{controversy}} in 1996 when she ruled that <b>a</b> pregnant <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> {{be held in}} hospital against her will and forced to have her baby by Caesarean section. The woman had wanted to give birth naturally, but was advised by doctors that both she and the child were likely to die as she was suffering from pre-eclampsia. The ruling was later overturned at the Court of Appeal, which ruled that <b>a</b> pregnant <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> refuse medical help even if doing so risked her baby's life.|$|R
5|$|This Act made null {{and void}} (with certain {{specific}} exceptions) the Marian act of 1554 that had repealed all Henry VIII's legislation from 1529 onwards, which had denied {{the authority of the}} See of Rome and also confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Supreme Governor was a suitably equivocal title that made Elizabeth head of the Church without ever saying she was. This was important for two reasons: (1) it satisfied those who felt that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> not rule the church, and (2) it acted in a conciliatory way toward English Roman Catholics. For the clergy, Elizabeth's changes were more wholesale than those of her half-brother, Edward, had been. All but one (Anthony Kitchin) of the bishops lost their posts, a hundred fellows of Oxford colleges were deprived; many dignitaries resigned rather than take the oath. The bishops who were removed from the ecclesiastical bench were replaced by appointees who would agree to the reforms.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{was very}} active in working with Latina feminists through the CIM. At the Seventh Pan-American Conference, held in 1933 in Montevideo, Uruguay, the women {{presented}} their analysis of {{the legal status of}} women in each of the 21 member countries. The first report ever to study in detail the civil and political rights of women, it had been prepared solely by women. They proposed a Treaty on the Equality of Rights for Women, and it was rejected by the conference, though it was signed by Cuba, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Three of those states had already granted suffrage to women, and none of the four ratified the Treaty after the conference. However, the women had presented the first international resolution to recommend suffrage for women. Next, Stevens presented their materials which showed the disparity between rights of men and women. For example, in 16 countries of the Americas women could not vote at all, in two countries they could vote with restrictions, and in three countries they had equal enfranchisement. In 19 of the American countries, women did not have equal custody over their children, including in seven US states, and only two countries allowed joint authority for women of their own children. None of the Latin American countries allowed women to serve on juries, and 27 US states prohibited women from participating in juries. Divorce grounds in 14 countries and 28 states were disparate for men and women, and <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> not administer her own separate property in 13 countries and two US states.|$|E
25|$|Tsi-Ku, {{also known}} as Tsi Ku Niang, is {{described}} as the Chinese goddess of the outhouse and divination. It is said that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> uncover the future {{by going to the}} outhouse to ask Tsi-Ku. See toilet god.|$|E

50|$|Linda Corbould {{was raised}} in Tasmania, Australia and joined the RAAF in 1981. <b>As</b> <b>women</b> <b>could</b> not become pilots in the RAAF at the time, she served as an air traffic {{controller}} until 1990 when pilot training was opened up to women. During this period she took up skydiving, and became a national champion in the sport. In 1985 she represented Australia at the skydiving world championships which were held in Turkey.|$|R

25|$|In many {{traditional}} cultures, communal grooming {{was a social}} event when <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> socialize and strengthen bonds between herself, other women and their families. Historically, hair braiding was not a paid trade. Since the African diaspora, in the 20th and 21st centuries it has developed as a multimillion-dollar business in such regions as the United States and western Europe. An individual's hair groomer was usually someone whom they knew closely. Sessions can include shampooing, oiling, combing, braiding and twisting, plus adding accessories.|$|E
25|$|She taught {{history when}} she {{returned}} to South Africa at Rhodes University in Grahamstown and University of the Witwatersrand. She stood for election where there were seven representatives for eight million black South Africans against the 140 M.P.s who represented the other 20% of the population. She had stood against other male candidates and talking through an interpreter had managed to win the electorate's confidence. It was said that she used the analogy of Joan of Arc to illustrate what <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> do for them.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish law {{protected}} {{women from}} the authority of their husbands by transferring the authority to their male relatives. A wife's property and land also could not {{be taken by the}} husband without her family's consent but neither could the wife. This mean <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> not transfer her property to her husband without her family or kinsman's consent either. In Swedish law, women would also only get half that of her brother in inheritance. Despite these legal issues, Sweden was largely ahead and much superior in their treatment towards women than most European countries.|$|E

25|$|No one by {{the name}} of Lucy Brewer (or that of her other pseudonyms, or that of her husband) can be found in {{historical}} records; in addition, it is highly unlikely <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> have disguised herself for three years on the Constitution, as the crew had little to no privacy. (For example, no toilet facilities or private quarters existed on the ship, and physical examinations were thorough in the Marines.) In addition, The Female Marines identifying details of the Constitutions travels and battles are nearly verbatim to accounts published by the ship's commanders in contemporary newspapers.|$|E
25|$|Society changed {{quickly after}} World War I. For example, customs, technology, and {{manufacturing}} all moved {{quickly into the}} 20th century after the interruption of the war. The rise of the automobile was {{an important factor in}} flapper culture, as cars meant <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> come and go as she pleased, travel to speakeasies and other entertainment venues, and use the large vehicles of the day for their popular activity, petting parties. Also, the economic boom allowed more people the time and money to play golf and tennis and to take vacations, which required clothing adapted to these activities; the flapper's slender silhouette was very suitable for movement.|$|E
25|$|Cheek kissing in Turkey is also widely {{accepted}} in greetings. Male to male cheek kissing is considered normal {{in almost every}} occasion, but very rarely for men who are introduced for the first time. Some men hit each other's head on the side instead of cheek kissing, possibly {{as an attempt to}} masculinize the action. Cheek kissing between women is also very common, but it is also very rare for women who are introduced for the first time. A man and <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> cheek kiss each other for greeting without sexual connotations only if they are good friends or depending on the circle, the setting, and the location like in big cities.|$|E

25|$|In Irish law, {{women were}} {{forbidden}} to act as witnesses in courts. In Welsh law, women's testimony can be accepted towards other women but not against another man. In France, women's testimony must corroborate with other accounts or would not be accepted. Although women were expected to not attend courts, this however was not always true. Sometimes regardless of expectation, women did participate and attend court cases and court meetings. But women could not act as justices in courts, be attorneys, {{they could not be}} members of a jury and they could not accuse another person of a felony unless it's the murder of her husband. For most part, the best thing <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> do in medieval courts is observe the legal proceedings taking place.|$|E
25|$|Test {{audience}} reactions led {{to several}} minor changes before {{the film was}} released. Originally, {{it was clear that}} Carmen was torn between Rico and Zander. Test audiences, regardless of gender, strongly felt that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> not love two men at once, so scenes which portrayed this were cut. These audiences also felt it was immoral for Carmen to choose a career ahead of being loyal to Rico, to the extent that many commented that, in so doing, Carmen should have been the one to die instead of Dizzy. While admitting {{it may have been a}} bad commercial decision not to change the film to accommodate this, the directors did cut a scene from after Zander's death where Carmen and Rico kiss, which the audience believed made the previous betrayal even more immoral.|$|E
25|$|The Empress's faction lacked an {{equivalent}} war leader to Stephen. Matilda had a firm grounding in government from her time as empress, {{where she had}} presided in court cases and acted as regent in Italy with the Imperial army on campaign. Nonetheless, Matilda, as <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>could</b> not personally lead forces into battle. Matilda was less popular with contemporary chroniclers than Stephen; in many ways she took after her father, being prepared to loudly demand compliance of her court, when necessary issuing threats and generally appearing arrogant. This was felt to be particularly inappropriate {{since she was a}} woman. Matilda's husband, Geoffrey of Anjou, {{played an important role in}} seizing Normandy during the war but did not cross into England. Geoffrey and Matilda's marriage was not an easy one; it had almost collapsed altogether in 1130.|$|E
