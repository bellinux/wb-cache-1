6000|$|... "Look here, Mr. Breck," [...] Shunk Wilson continued. [...] "You've been interruptin' proceedings, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{explain the}} meanin' of it. What was you chinnin' about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not? Guess anybody's got a {{right to}} get cool--night like this. Besides, they won't be back till 4 P.M. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> get cool. Come on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come with me, my boy, {{into the}} larder. There, help yourself; {{you must be}} hungry <b>and</b> tired, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do it over again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{guess you}} want to see Mr.Â Brownsill,' he said. 'Well, I am in his place now, <b>and</b> all <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do is to tell me what book you want.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{stay here}} forever," [...] {{answered}} Jack, with a smile. [...] "After you've made your pile {{you can go}} to some place more agreeable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You got to hang {{your things}} on that hook, all but your shoes and stockings, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{hang on to}} them, yourself. Forty's your number, and forty's your hook, and they give you the clothes off'n it in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{got to keep}} up our position, any'ow," [...] said Kipps, turning towards her. [...] "It {{stands to}} reason, Ann, we got a position. Very well! I can't 'ave you scrubbin' floors. You got to 'ave a servant <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> manage a 'ouse. You wouldn't 'ave me ashamed----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you got {{to return}} that call. That's what {{you got to}} do! I know----" [...] He waved his arm vaguely towards the {{miscellany}} of books in the recess. [...] "It's in Manners and Rools of Good S'ity. You got to find jest 'ow many cards to leave <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go and leave 'em. See?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{you are not}} to cry! You {{would be}} more sorry if I was dead, and not here at all, Babie; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> thank God for that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What in thunder {{has that}} to do with you? Carnaway was about his house at night, and he shot him. That's enough for me <b>and</b> <b>you.</b> You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> settle the thing right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then don't begin. It's late, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{start for}} the bluff at sun-up and haul those fence-posts home. The job has been hanging on too long and must be {{finished}} to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{you have}} to have recommendations--they won't touch you without 'em; and then {{you have to}} have about seventy-five dollars capital to start with. You got to get your coat, and your cap, and your badge, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> have about twenty dollars of your own to make change with, first off; company don't start you with a cent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well--sure--Course {{you might}} say--" [...] Babbitt was {{conscious}} of how feeble he sounded, conscious of Gunch's mature and relentless eye. [...] "Gosh, you know where I stand! I'm no labor agitator! I'm a business man, first, last, and all the time! But--but honestly, I don't think Doane means so badly, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> remember he's {{an old friend of}} mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} 'ave known. I {{did in a}} sort of way know. And 'ere we are! I wouldn't care so much if it was myself, but it's you, Ann! 'Ere we are! Regular smashed up! And you----" [...] He checked at an unspeakable {{aggravation}} of their disaster. [...] "I knew 'e wasn't to be depended upon and there I left it! <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> pay.... What's to 'appen to us all, I don't know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean that}} she ever tries {{to show them}} off; though I know some girls that would. But she's not that kind. She ain't {{much more than a}} child, <b>and</b> yet <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> treat her just like a woman. Noticed the kind of way she's got?" ...|$|R
60|$|But he only {{smiled a}} sad, sweet smile, {{and got out}} some more diagrams. You know the result {{perfectly}} well, because you {{know that when you}} have once opened the door to a canvasser, the trouble is done <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> suffer defeat.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I {{am asking}} {{you what you}} have done with the night-gown <b>and</b> sheet that <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> wipe the blood off {{yourself}} with,' said she.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and {{you done}} more than that," [...] said Injun Joe, {{approaching}} the doctor, who was now standing. [...] "Five years ago you drove me away from your father's kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to eat, and you said I warn't there for any good; and when I swore I'd get even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for a vagrant. Did you think I'd forget? The Injun blood ain't in me for nothing. And now I've GOT you, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> SETTLE, you know!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'In other countries, art and {{literature}} are left {{to a lot of}} shabby bums living in attics and feeding on booze and spaghetti, but in America the successful writer or picture-painter is indistinguishable from any other decent business man; and I, for one, am only too glad that the man who has the rare skill to season his message with interesting reading matter and who shows both purpose and pep in handling his literary wares has a chance to drag down his fifty thousand bucks a year, to mingle with the biggest executives on terms of perfect equality, and to show as big a house and as swell a car as any Captain of Industry! But, mind you, it's the appreciation of the Regular Guy who I have been depicting which has made this possible, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> hand as much credit to him as to the authors themselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll prophesy if you like," [...] {{said the}} captain with renewed vigour. [...] "Refuse this, {{because you think}} {{yourself}} too honest, and before a month's out you'll be gaoled for a sneak-thief. I give you the word fair. I can see it, Herrick, if you can't; you're breaking down. Don't think, if you refuse this chance, that you'll go on doing the evangelical; you're about through with your stock; {{and before you know}} where you are, you'll be right out on the other side. No, it's either this for you; or else it's Caledonia. I bet you never were there, and saw those white, shaved men, in their dust-clothes and straw hats, prowling around in gangs in the lamplight at Noumea; they look like wolves, and they look like preachers, and they look like the sick; Huish is a daisy to the best of them. Well, there's your company. They're waiting for you, Herrick, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go; and that's a prophecy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen to me, both of you!" [...] said Lady Valleys: [...] "You two are {{altogether}} different; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> {{must not}} quarrel. I won't have that. Now, Eustace, you are our son, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be kind and considerate. Sit down, and let's talk it over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{they must}} be alarmed," [...] the poacher said carelessly. [...] "You have {{interfered}} in this business, which was none of yours, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> take the consequences; you may think yourself a lucky fellow {{that you are not}} by this time drifting about on the tideway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{must see}} your dinner service, Major, so that I may know about its color, <b>and</b> what <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> put the flowers into." ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{lady from}} within signalled the conductor. He stopped the car, and the lady, who had risen with her escort, {{remained}} chatting {{with a friend}} before she got out. The conductor snapped his bell for starting, {{with a look of}} patient sarcasm. [...] "See that?" [...] he asked Lemuel. [...] "Some these women act as if the cars was their private carriage; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> act so too, or the lady complains of you, and the company bounces you in a minute. Stock's owned along the line, and they think they own you too. You can't get 'em to set more than ten on a side; they'll leave the car first. I'd like to catch 'em on some the South End or Cambridge cars. I'd show 'em how to pack live stock once, anyway. Yes, sir, these ladies that ride on this line think they can keep the car standin' while they talk about the opera. But you'd ought to see how they all look if a poor woman tries their little game. Oh, I tell you, rich people are hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I hain't but oncet. Oncet {{is enough}} for me. I run away, while I was in Venice, and went ashore--if {{you can call it}} ashore; it's all water, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go round in boats: gondolas they call 'em there--and went to see the American counsul, and told him I was an American boy, and {{tried to get him to}} get me off. But he couldn't do anything. If you ship under the Swedish flag you're a Swede, and the whole United States couldn't get you off. If I'd 'a' shipped under the American flag I'd 'a' been an American, I don't care if I was born in Hottentot. That's what the counsul said. I never want to see that town ag'in. I used to hear songs about Venice--'Beautiful Venice, Bride of the Sea;' but I think it's a kind of a hole of a place. Well, what I started to say was that when I turn up in Boston, now,--and I most {{generally}} do,--I don't go to no sailor boardin'-house; I break for the Wayfarer's Lodge, every time. It's a temperance house, and they give you the worth o' your money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{read about}} them once--you'll see. Look at Henry the Eight; this 'n 's a Sunday-school Superintendent to HIM. And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies {{that used to}} rip around so in old times and raise Cain. My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight {{when he was in}} bloom. He WAS a blossom. He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning. And he would do it just as {{indifferent}} as if he was ordering up eggs. 'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he says. They fetch her up. Next morning, 'Chop off her head!' And they chop it off. 'Fetch up Jane Shore,' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, 'Chop off her head'--and they chop it off. 'Ring up Fair Rosamun.' Fair Rosamun answers the bell. Next morning, 'Chop off her head.' And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book--which was a good name and stated the case. You don't know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I've struck in history. Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How does he go at it --give notice?--give the country a show? No. All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. That was HIS style--he never give anybody a chance. He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do? Ask him to show up? No--drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. S'pose people left money laying around where he was--what did he do? He collared it. S'pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn't set down there and see that he done it--what did he do? He always done the other thing. S'pose he opened his mouth--what then? If he didn't shut it up powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time. That's the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done. I don't say that ourn is lambs, because they ain't, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain't nothing to THAT old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is kings, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> make allowances. Take them all around, they're a mighty ornery lot. It's the way they're raised." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{waste your}} breath, Pelter. We {{let you go}} on those other charges, {{but we are not}} going to let you go on this one," [...] {{interrupted}} Dick. [...] "This was a downright steal, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> take the consequences. Mr. Bronson, what do you want to do with them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I got out, but I {{tell you}} right now he's <b>got</b> {{something}} coming <b>to</b> him. No mail-sifter of a little two-for-a-cent town like Eagle is goin' to put it all over me that way and not repent of it. I've figured out a scheme to get even with him, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> help." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just this--I'm {{anxious to}} form some idea {{as to when}} I'm likely to get my money back. Since Miss Crestwick dropped you, there's only Miss Gladwyne available, so far as I know, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> marry money and do so pretty soon. I'm willing to do {{anything}} that may help on the match." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Sin Wagon" [...] {{was written}} [...] "really quickly". The song's {{message is that}} [...] "even the most good girl just has that wild side <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> let it out occasionally," [...] a {{contrast}} to country music's [...] "stay-at-home" [...] stereotype.|$|E
5000|$|On March 7, 2016 Austin {{released}} a statement saying [...] "Ok people Love Sick Radio is being mastered right now!! Sorry I've been MIA but life happens <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> handle your shit the best you can! #love #sick #radio and {{thank you all so}} so so much for your #patience #passion and I know it's frustrating! Hope you all are doing very well! Can't wait to see you!!!". The statement confirmed that his album would be named [...] "Love Sick Radio" [...] and it is being mastered right now.|$|E
5000|$|Goldman quotes Harold Seider, Lennon's {{lawyer for}} the last few years of his life, as saying that much of Lennon's public image was largely fabricated: The real Lennon was not the public {{statements}} that he made. They were made because they were public statements, and he was looking to make a point. He couldn't give a shit (about lying) because to a certain extent he had contempt for the media because they bought all the crap. He was there to manipulate the media. He enjoyed doing that. He understood how to use the media. You got to give him credit for that, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> give her credit... They would use the media, but it was not that they believed it, but that was the image they wanted to present.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because this hill is only twenty-five feet {{through from}} side to side; <b>and</b> so <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> build two hundred and twenty-five feet of your tunnel on trestle-work!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you will}} stand it," [...] cried Phil, {{throwing}} {{caution to the}} winds. [...] "All we ask is a fair deal, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> give it to us. We'll make up those lessons, if you'll give us {{a fair amount of}} time. I don't intend to be put in a lower class for nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|Levi {{laid down}} his {{knife and fork}} with a clatter. [...] "Squire Hall!" [...] said he, [...] "what's Squire Hall <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do with it? Squire Hall didn't have {{the use of that}} money. It was <b>you</b> had it <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> pay it back to me, <b>and</b> if <b>you</b> don't do it, by G----, I'll have the law on you, sure as you're born." ...|$|R
