5|$|The origin <b>and</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> Ely's name {{have always}} been {{regarded}} as obscure by place-name scholars, and are still disputed. The earliest record of the name is in the Latin text of Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, where Bede wrote Elge. This is apparently not a Latin name, and subsequent Latin texts nearly all used the forms Elia, Eli, or Heli with inorganic H-. In Old English charters, and in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the spelling is usually Elig.|$|E
5|$|The {{rejection}} of traditional forms and structures for poetry {{that began in}} the first half of the 20th century coincided with a questioning of the purpose <b>and</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> traditional definitions of poetry and of distinctions between poetry and prose, particularly given examples of poetic prose and prosaic poetry. Numerous modernist poets have written in non-traditional forms or in what traditionally would have been considered prose, although their writing was generally infused with poetic diction and often with rhythm and tone established by non-metrical means. While there was a substantial formalist reaction within the modernist schools to the breakdown of structure, this reaction focused as much on the development of new formal structures and syntheses as on the revival of older forms and structures.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{a number of}} {{painters}} emphasised landscape in their works, a development led {{in part by the}} shift in preference from religious iconography to secular subjects. Second-generation Netherlandish painters applied the mid-14th-century dictum of natural representation. This was born of the rising affluence of the region's middle class, many of whom had now travelled south and seen countryside noticeably different from their flat homeland. At the same time, the later part of the century saw the emergence of specialisation and a number of masters focused on detailing landscape, most notably Konrad Witz in the mid-15th century, and later Joachim Patinir. Most innovations in this format came from artists living in the Dutch regions of the Burgundian lands, most notably from Haarlem, Leiden and 's-Hertogenbosch. The significant artists from these areas did not slavishly reproduce the scenery before them, but in subtle ways adapted and modified their landscapes to reinforce the emphasis <b>and</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the panel they were working on.|$|E

5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to find the right path that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete the maze, or they may {{have to figure out how}} to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find a path through the maze that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying a nearby tree with branches that mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand the mechanic <b>and</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|E
