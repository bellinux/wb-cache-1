30|$|<b>Anaesthetics</b> are {{necessary}} for many procedures in aquaculture. The analysis of blood parameters {{is one of the}} most valuable methods of <b>anaesthetics</b> evaluation, because it has been shown that the physiological effects of <b>anaesthetics</b> are species-specific and age-dependent (Anver Celik 2004).

40|$|The present {{randomised}} controlled study {{compared the}} 3 -year outcome of local <b>anaesthetics</b> with <b>anaesthetics</b> and lavage in patients suffering from painful temporomandibular joint (TMJ) locking. The study included 45 patients referred {{for treatment of}} temporomandibular disorders (TMD) to the Department of Orofacial Pain and Jaw Function, Faculty of Odontology, Malmo University, Malmo, Sweden. All patients received a history questionnaire and clinical examination according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD, panoramic radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging at baseline. Twenty-five patients were randomised to <b>anaesthetics</b> alone and 20 patients to <b>anaesthetics</b> and lavage. Three years after treatment, we sent the 37 patients who were available for follow-up a questionnaire that evaluated pain intensity, physical and emotional functioning, and global improvement. Thirty-four patients responded. The primary outcome was defined as >= 30 % pain relief. In an intention-to-treat analysis, 28 of 45 patients (62 %) reported >= 30 % pain relief at the follow-up. At 3 years, improvement in pain relief, physical functioning, emotional functioning and global improvement differed non-significantly between local <b>anaesthetics</b> and <b>anaesthetics</b> and lavage. Compared with baseline, significant improvements (P < 0. 05) in pain intensity, physical functioning, emotional functioning and global changes had occurred in both groups after 3 years.

5|$|The pudendal nerve is {{the main}} nerve of the perineum. It carries {{sensation}} from the external genitalia of both sexes and the skin around the anus and perineum, as well the motor supply to various pelvic muscles, including the male or female external urethral sphincter and the external anal sphincter. If damaged, most commonly by childbirth, lesions may cause sensory loss or fecal incontinence. The nerve may be temporarily blocked {{as part of an}} <b>anaesthetic</b> procedure.|$|E
5|$|Nitrous oxide (N2O), {{better known}} as {{laughing}} gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten ammonium nitrate at 250°C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned whipped cream, and was formerly commonly used as an <b>anaesthetic.</b> Despite appearances, it cannot {{be considered to be}} the anhydride of hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or ozone at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N+O−↔−N=N+=O): above 600°C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.|$|E
50|$|These {{observations}} were {{important because they}} demonstrated that general <b>anaesthetics</b> may also interact with hydrophobic protein sites of certain proteins, rather than affect membrane proteins indirectly through nonspecific interactions with lipid bilayer as mediator. It was shown that <b>anaesthetics</b> alter the functions of many cytoplasmic signalling proteins, including protein kinase C, however, the proteins considered the most likely molecular targets of <b>anaesthetics</b> are ion channels. According to this theory general <b>anaesthetics</b> are much more selective than {{in the frame of}} lipid hypothesis and they bind directly only to small number of targets in CNS mostly ligand(neurotransmitter)-gated ion channels in synapse and G-protein coupled receptors altering their ion flux. Particularly Cys-loop receptors are plausible targets for general <b>anaesthetics</b> that bind at the interface between the subunits. The Cys-loop receptor superfamily includes inhibitory receptors (GABA A, GABA C, glycine receptors) and excitatory receptors (acetylcholine receptor and 5-HT3 serotonin receptor). General <b>anaesthetics</b> can inhibit the channel functions of excitatory receptors or potentiate functions of inhibitory receptors, respectively. Although protein targets for <b>anaesthetics</b> have been partly identified the exact nature of general anaesthetic-protein interactions still remains a mystery.|$|R
30|$|Intraperitoneal {{administration}} of local <b>anaesthetics</b> has been evaluated for several different laparoscopic procedures [25 – 29]. It {{is based on}} the theory that the instillation of local <b>anaesthetics</b> in the peritoneal cavity blocks the visceral afferent signalling, thereby resulting in reduced nociception [30]. The literature presented in this review does not support the use of local <b>anaesthetics</b> for SP reduction in benign gynaecological laparoscopy. None of the studies could demonstrate a reduction in incidence, and only two out of six studies reported a significant reduction in the severity of SP [10, 14]. Despite this, three out of six studies found a significant reduction of post-operative analgesic consumption [10, 11, 14]. The present evidence does not support a widespread use of intraperitoneal local <b>anaesthetics</b> in benign gynaecological laparoscopy for reduction of SP. Besides a local effect in the peritoneal cavity, the analgesic effect of intraperitoneal local <b>anaesthetics</b> could also be mediated through systemic absorption. There are measurable plasma levels of local <b>anaesthetics</b> shortly after intraperitoneal administration due to absorption over the peritoneal surface. A potential risk with {{administration of}} intraperitoneal local <b>anaesthetics</b> is that the dosage is difficult to control. Although plasma levels of local <b>anaesthetics</b> have been reported to be close to and above safe threshold, no clinical toxicity or adverse effects have thus far been reported [31]. It cannot be ruled out that local <b>anaesthetics</b> can be used to reduce SP after laparoscopic surgery for benign gynaecological disease, but further studies are warranted before a general recommendation can be made.|$|R
40|$|Pharmacokinetic {{models can}} be {{differentiated}} into two groups: physiological-based models and empirical models. Traditionally the pharmacokinetics of volatile <b>anaesthetics</b> are described using physiological-based models {{together with the}} respective tissue-blood distribution coefficients. The compartments of the empirical model have no anatomical equivalents and are merely {{the product of the}} mathematical procedure for parameter estimation. The end expiratory concentration of volatile <b>anaesthetics</b> is approximately equal to the arterial concentration and, therefore, the description of the transition between plasma and effect site for volatile <b>anaesthetics</b> plays a central role. The most important parameter here is the k(e 0) value which is a time constant and describes the time delay for the transition from the central compartment to the calculated effect compartment. The k(e 0) values for sevoflurane and isoflurane are the same but the concentration balance between the end-tidal concentration and the effect compartment occurs twice as quickly with desflurane. In clinical practice volatile <b>anaesthetics</b> are normally combined with N(2) O and/or opioids. This results in an additive interaction between volatile <b>anaesthetics</b> and N(2) O but a synergistic interaction of volatile <b>anaesthetics</b> with opioids. However, there are relatively few investigations on the interactions between the clinically widely used combination of volatile <b>anaesthetics,</b> N(2) O and opioids. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes in a patient with chronic venous insufficiency, which results in chronic venous disease, is quite different from an examination request made for suspected deep vein thrombosis. For a DVT investigation {{there is a need for}} guidance as to what to look for and to the intended treatment. An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example is very different from the examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, minimally invasive surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local <b>anaesthetic.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1944, {{writing as}} Major Harold Ridley FRCS RAMC, the English {{ophthalmic}} surgeon published a short {{paper in the}} British Journal of Ophthalmology on spitting snakes and {{an account of the}} composition and action of snake venom in general. From his own experiences in wartime Ghana, then known as the Gold Coast, Ridley described snake venom ophthalmia in a 30-year-old labourer named Gogi Kumasi, who was cutting grass when a Black-necked cobra raised its head from the grass and forcibly spat venom toward the man's right eye from a four- or five-feet distance. Ridley treated the man and followed his case until the eye had fully recoveredafter about a week. In conclusion, after discussion on the therapeutic uses of snake venom, he conjectured that in the future diluted venom or a constituent of venom might be used as a powerful <b>anaesthetic</b> in some cases of ophthalmic surgery.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, even as {{the battle}} had {{continued}} the evacuation of the Australian casualties had begun, {{with a number of}} Iroquois helicopters from No. 9 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) under Squadron Leader Jim Cox, flying through heavy ground fire to complete the dust-off. Hindered by artillery fire and the dense foliage the operation proved difficult and Cox's aircraft was hit by heavy machine-gun fire, wounding him and an orderly on board. Safely landing the damaged aircraft he then directed the operation by radio from the ground. Among the worst of the casualties was Sergeant Alexander Sutherland, from 2 Platoon. Losing an eye and suffering heavy blood loss from multiple shrapnel wounds after a Viet Cong rocket exploded within a metre of him, he was evacuated to 8 Field Ambulance in Vung Tau with no pulse. His left leg later amputated, his wounds were so bad he had to be given a general <b>anaesthetic</b> each time his bandages were changed. Making a miraculous recovery however, he was personally recommended for the US Medal of Honor by Westmoreland for his resolute spirit, although this was later reduced to a lesser Australian award. Many casualties were beyond help however, and the battalion chaplain was inserted by winch from a helicopter to administer last rites.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, the {{correlation}} between lipid solubility and potency of general <b>anaesthetics</b> is a necessary but not sufficient condition for inferring a lipid target site. General <b>anaesthetics</b> could equally well be binding to hydrophobic target sites on proteins in the brain. The main reason that more polar general <b>anaesthetics</b> are less potent {{is that they have}} to cross the blood-brain barrier to exert their effect on neurons in the brain.|$|R

50|$|Experimental {{studies have}} shown that general <b>anaesthetics</b> {{including}} ethanol are potent fluidizers of natural and artificial membranes. However, changes in membrane density and fluidity in the presence of clinical concentrations of general <b>anaesthetics</b> are so small that relatively small increases in temperature (~1 °C) can mimic them without causing anaesthesia. The change in body temperature of approximately 1 °C is within the physiological range and clearly it is not sufficient to induce loss of consciousness per se. Thus membranes are fluidized only by large quantities of <b>anaesthetics,</b> but there are no changes in membrane fluidity when concentrations of <b>anaesthetics</b> are small and restricted to pharmacologically relevant.|$|R
25|$|An inhalational <b>anaesthetic</b> is a {{chemical}} compound possessing general <b>anaesthetic</b> properties {{that can be}} delivered via inhalation.

Agents of significant contemporary clinical interest include volatile <b>anaesthetic</b> agents such as isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane, and <b>anaesthetic</b> gases such as nitrous oxide and xenon.|$|E
25|$|This {{chemical}} is an inhalational <b>anaesthetic</b> studied only {{in animals}} in 1967, and toxicology investigations did not acknowledge this fact.

40|$|Background Growing {{evidence}} suggests a protective effect of volatile <b>anaesthetics</b> in ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) -injury, and {{the accumulation of}} neutrophils is a crucial event. Pro-inflammatory cytokines carrying the C-X-C-motif including interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) and CXC-ligand 1 (CXCL 1) activate CXC receptor- 1 (CXCR 1; stimulated by IL- 8), CXC receptor- 2 (CXCR 2; stimulated by IL- 8 and CXCL 1), or both to induce CD 11 b-dependent neutrophil transmigration. Inhibition of CXCR 1, CXCR 2, or both reduces I/R-injury by preventing neutrophil accumulation. We hypothesized that interference with CXCR 1 /CXCR 2 signalling contributes to the well-established beneficial effect of volatile <b>anaesthetics</b> in I/R-injury. Methods Isolated human neutrophils were stimulated with IL- 8 or CXCL 1 and exposed to volatile <b>anaesthetics</b> (sevoflurane/desflurane). Neutrophil migration was assessed using an adapted Boyden chamber. Expression of CD 11 b, CXCR 1, and CXCR 2 was measured by flow cytometry. Blocking antibodies against CXCR 1 /CXCR 2 /CD 11 b and phorbol myristate acetate were used to investigate specific pathways. Results Volatile <b>anaesthetics</b> reduced CD 11 b-dependent neutrophil transmigration induced by IL- 8 by > 30 % and CD 11 b expression by 18 and 27 % with sevoflurane/desflurane, respectively. This effect was independent of CXCR 1 /CXCR 2 expression and CXCR 1 /CXCR 2 endocytosis. Inhibition of CXCR 1 signalling did not affect downregulation of CD 11 b with volatile <b>anaesthetics.</b> Blocking of CXCR 2 -signalling neutralized effects by volatile <b>anaesthetics</b> on CD 11 b expression. Specific stimulation of CXCR 2 with CXCL 1 was sufficient to induce upregulation of CD 11 b, which was impaired with volatile <b>anaesthetics.</b> No effect of volatile <b>anaesthetics</b> was observed with direct stimulation of protein kinase C located downstream of CXCR 1 /CXCR 2. Conclusion Volatile <b>anaesthetics</b> attenuate neutrophil inflammatory responses elicited by CXC cytokines through interference with CXCR 2 signalling. This might contribute to the beneficial effect of volatile <b>anaesthetics</b> in I/R-injur...|$|R
