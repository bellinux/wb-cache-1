5|$|Baruch Kimmerling and Joel S. Migdal {{argue that}} the revolt was a {{formative}} event for the Palestinian sense of nationhood in that it brought together disparate groups against <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>enemy.</b> Moreover, they asserted that these groups reemerged later to constitute the Palestinian people. The revolt represented a moment of political unity in Palestine. However, the ultimate intention of the notables and rebel leaders was to force out the Egyptian army and reinstate Ottoman rule {{as a means of}} restoring the Ottoman-era standards that defined the relationship {{between the government and the}} governed. These standards were made up of the religious laws, administrative codes and local norms and traditions that were disrupted by Egyptian reforms.|$|E
5|$|In the city, Argante and Armida, {{in danger}} from <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>enemy,</b> become {{reconciled}} and prepare their troops for battle. Goffredo's army advances, and battle finally commences. After {{a struggle for}} supremacy, Jerusalem falls to Goffredo; Argante is overcome and captured by Rinaldo, while Armida is taken by Eustazio. Rinaldo and Almirena celebrate their love and forthcoming marriage. Armida, accepting her defeat, breaks the wand which {{is the source of}} her evil power and together with Argante embraces Christianity. Goffredo expresses his forgiveness to his beaten foes and sets them free, before victors and vanquished join in a chorus of reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|After Extreme Rules, Orton began pairing with Daniel Bryan {{despite their}} poor {{relationship}} to face <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>enemy</b> in the Shield. On the June 14 SmackDown, Orton teamed with Bryan and Kane {{to end the}} Shield's unpinned and unsubmitted streak in televised six-man tag matches. Three days later at Payback, Orton and Bryan's poor teamwork resulted in an unsuccessful challenge for Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins' WWE Tag Team Championships. The following night on Raw, Orton and Bryan faced off in a no disqualification match, which Orton won via referee stoppage after Bryan suffered a legitimate nerve injury. Four days later on SmackDown, Orton was defeated by Bryan in a singles match via countout. Orton and Bryan faced {{each other for the}} third time on the next Raw, but their match ended in a no-contest after both men were counted out. Later that night, Orton was defeated by Bryan in a Street Fight Match after he was forced to submit to the Yes! Lock with a kindo stick applied to the move.|$|E

50|$|The {{alliance}} between the USA and USSR was simply against <b>a</b> greater <b>common</b> <b>enemy</b> and the two countries never really trusted each other. After the Axis was defeated, these two powers became highly suspicious of each other because of their vastly different ideologies.|$|R
5|$|Several {{attempts}} at a Franco-Mongol alliance against the Islamic caliphates, their common enemy, {{were made by}} various leaders among the Frankish Crusaders and the Mongol Empire in the 13th century. Such an alliance might have seemed an obvious choice: the Mongols were already sympathetic to Christianity, given the presence of many influential Nestorian Christians in the Mongol court. The Franks (Western Europeans {{and those in the}} Crusader States of the Levant) were open to the idea of support from the East, in part owing to the long-running legend of the mythical Prester John, an Eastern king in a magical kingdom who many believed would one day come to the assistance of the Crusaders in the Holy Land. The Franks and Mongols also shared <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>enemy</b> in the Muslims. However, despite many messages, gifts, and emissaries {{over the course of several}} decades, the often-proposed alliance never came to fruition.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{relations}} between French and Irish have been generally positive, as both peoples shared <b>a</b> <b>common</b> religion, Roman Catholicism, and <b>a</b> <b>common</b> Protestant <b>enemy,</b> England (later the United Kingdom). French kings during the 16th to 19th centuries often supported Irish and Scottish interests against English advances in Ireland and Scotland.|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} set in 326 B.C. The film begins after Alexander the Great (Sikander in Hindi/Urdu) conquers Persia and the Kabul valley and {{approaches}} the Indian border at Jhelum.

In the game, players are able to choose between the Pro-Registration side, headed by Iron Man, or the Anti-Registration side, headed by Captain America up {{to the point where the}} heroes end up uniting against <b>a</b> new <b>common</b> <b>enemy</b> called The Fold.|$|R
25|$|Brazil was {{the first}} country to {{recognize}} the independence of Paraguay in 1844. At this time Argentina still considered it a break-away province. While Argentina was ruled by Juan Manuel Rosas (1829–1852), <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>enemy</b> of both Brazil and Paraguay, Brazil contributed to {{the improvement of the}} fortifications and development of the Paraguayan army, sending officials and technical help to Asunción.|$|E
25|$|Every tribe {{within the}} {{confederation}} was {{ruled by a}} chief or cacique. Most of the tribes {{were part of the}} Muisca ethnic group, sharing the same language and culture, and relating through trade. They united in the face of <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>enemy.</b> The army was the responsibility of the zipa or zaque. The army was made up of the güeches, the traditional ancient warriors of the Muisca.|$|E
25|$|By {{the fall}} of 1920 it became {{increasingly}} clear that the Soviet regime would emerge from the Russian Civil War victorious. With fall of the Whites, <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>enemy</b> which united disparate factions around the Soviet banner, much unity was loosened. Dissident {{groups such as the}} so-called Workers' Opposition and the Democratic Centralists emerged in the Communist Party, widespread dissatisfaction among the peasantry over forced grain requisitioning resulted in isolated uprisings. All of these factors prompted a wave of debate about the institutions that had sprung up in Soviet society during wartime, including Proletkult.|$|E

50|$|In 1542, facing <b>a</b> <b>common</b> Habsburg <b>enemy,</b> Francis I {{sought to}} renew the Franco-Ottoman alliance. As a result, Suleiman {{dispatched}} 100 galleys under Barbarossa to assist the French in the western Mediterranean. Barbarossa pillaged the coast of Naples and Sicily before reaching France, where Francis made Toulon the Ottoman admiral's naval headquarters. Barbarossa attacked and captured Nice in 1543. By 1544, a peace between Francis I and Charles V had put a temporary end to the alliance between France and the Ottoman Empire.|$|R
50|$|Already, {{during the}} France-Habsburg rivalry {{that started in}} the 16th century, France had tried to find allies {{to the east of}} Austria and hoped to ally with Poland. Polish King Jan III Sobieski also had the {{intention}} to ally with France against the threat of Austria, but the greater threat posed by the Muslim-led Ottoman Empire made him fight for the Christian cause in the Battle of Vienna. In the 18th century, Poland was partitioned by Russia, Prussia and Austria, but Napoleon recreated the Polish state in the Duchy of Warsaw. With the rise of a united German Empire in the 19th century, both France and Poland found <b>a</b> new <b>common</b> <b>enemy.</b>|$|R
25|$|During {{the civil}} war, the groups {{fighting}} the Derg government had <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>enemy,</b> so the TPLF allied {{itself with the}} Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF). In 1991 {{as part of the}} United Nations-facilitated transition of power to the transitional government, it was agreed that the EPLF should set up an autonomous transitional government in Eritrea and that a referendum would be held in Eritrea to find out if Eritreans wanted to secede from Ethiopia. The referendum was held and the vote was overwhelmingly in favour of independence. In April 1993 independence was achieved and the new state joined the United Nations.|$|E
25|$|In April 1919, Poland {{captured}} Vilnius {{and came}} in contact with the Lithuanian Army fighting in the Lithuanian–Soviet War. Faced with <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>enemy,</b> the Polish–Lithuanian relations were not immediately hostile. Poland hoped to persuade Lithuania to join some kind of Polish–Lithuanian union (see the Międzymorze federation), which Lithuania saw as loss of independence to Polish federalism. As bilateral relations worsened, the Entente drew two demarcation lines in hopes to stall further open hostilities. The lines did not please anyone and were ignored. When a Polish coup against the Lithuanian government failed in August 1919, the front stabilized until summer 1920.|$|E
25|$|Picking {{up where}} the {{previous}} episode left off, Linden (Mireille Enos) and Holder (Joel Kinnaman) peg Gwen and Jamie as prime suspects—the only ones in Richmond's campaign with enough power to broker a deal between the Indians and Michael Ames. The detectives enter Mayor Adams' office and strike a deal: he (Tom Butler) will keep Lt. Carlson off their backs {{and they will not}} expose Adams' involvement in the doctored toll booth photo of Richmond. Linden insists they are fighting <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>enemy,</b> noting that Richmond's camp planted the Indian bones at Adams' waterfront construction site.|$|E
50|$|The Salahuddin Campaign was a {{military}} conflict in the Saladin Governorate (Salahuddin Governorate), located in north-central Iraq, involving various factions (both internal & external) fighting against <b>a</b> single <b>common</b> <b>enemy,</b> the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The province exited Iraqi government control during ISIL's Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014) when large swathes of {{the north of the}} country were captured by the militant group with the Iraqi national army quickly disintegrating in the path of its advance. In light of the sweeping gains of the militants, Nouri Al-Maliki, the Prime Minister of Iraq at that time, attempted to declare a state of emergency though the Iraqi Parliament blocked his efforts to do so.|$|R
25|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war in}} August 1914 initially served to quiet the prevalent social and political protests, focusing hostilities against <b>a</b> <b>common</b> external <b>enemy,</b> but this patriotic unity did not last long. As the war dragged on inconclusively, war-weariness gradually took its toll. More important, though, was a deeper fragility: although many ordinary Russians joined anti-German demonstrations {{in the first few}} weeks of the war, the most widespread reaction appears to have been skepticism and fatalism. Hostility toward the Kaiser and the desire to defend their land and their lives did not necessarily translate into enthusiasm for the Tsar or the government.|$|R
50|$|Gnipper has {{one long}} {{triangular}} tooth and otherwise looks almost exactly like his father. He loves to chase cats. The dogs {{get up to}} lots of mischief. They are both Abyssinian Wire-Haired Tripe Hounds. Gnasher also has five daughters, Gnancy, Gnatasha, Gnaomi, Gnanette, and Gnorah, all of whom resemble smaller versions of Gnasher with white fur. They rarely appear in the strip, {{and it has been}} suggested they live with their unnamed mother. The two dogs share <b>a</b> <b>common</b> canine <b>enemy,</b> in the form of Walter the Softy's pet poodle Foo Foo, who they are very commonly seen menacing.|$|R
25|$|The story {{concerns}} mischievous mythical creatures, the Gremlins of the title, often invoked by Royal Air Force pilots as {{an explanation}} of mechanical troubles and mishaps. In Dahl's book, the gremlins' motivation for sabotaging British aircraft is revenge {{of the destruction of}} their forest home, which was razed to make way for an aircraft factory. The principal character in the book, Gus, has his Hawker Hurricane fighter destroyed over the English Channel by a gremlin, but is able to convince the gremlins as they parachute into the water that they should join forces against <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>enemy,</b> Hitler and the Nazis, rather than fight each other.|$|E
25|$|The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland {{had created}} several tenuous unions {{in the decades}} {{preceding}} the conflict, including the 1385 Union of Krewo, the 1392 Ostrów Agreement, and the 1413 Union of Horodło. The two states had successfully joined forces against <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>enemy,</b> the Teutonic Knights, at the 1410 Battle of Grunwald. The Knights' defeat in the battle weakened but did not completely vanquish their military power and they continued to engage in lesser conflicts. Internal tensions within the tentatively unified state persisted after the battle. While Jogaila (Jagiełło) and Vytautas had converted to Roman Catholicism, the Eastern Orthodox elite, along with some Lithuanian magnates, opposed a closer union with Poland.|$|E
25|$|An {{inscription}} {{detailing the}} Gahadavala genealogy from Yashovigraha to Chandradeva {{has been found}} at Gangaikonda Cholapuram in the Chola territory. It ends abruptly, so the name of its issuer is not certain, but {{it appears to have}} been issued during the reign of either Madanavarman or Govindachandra. Historian H. C. Ray speculated that the Gahadavalas and the Cholas may have developed friendly relations, because they both shared the Kalachuris as <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>enemy.</b> As a result, a Gahadavala prince may have visited Gangaikonda Cholapuram and issued the inscription. The 1119 CE Set-Mahet inscription states that Govindachandra made some grants at the request of a monk from the Chola kingdom. This further corroborates the theory of friendly relations between the two kingdoms.|$|E

5000|$|At the 1924 general {{election}} the Labour Party {{had for the}} first time stood two candidates in Oldham.

The Unionists therefore had to decide whether to chance splitting the anti-Labour vote at the by-election by running their own candidate in opposition to Wiggins and they chose not to run the risk [...]|$|R
5|$|Rome's {{preoccupation with}} its war with Carthage {{provided}} an opportunity for Philip V {{of the kingdom of}} Macedonia, located in the north of the Greek peninsula, to attempt to extend his power westward. Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal's camp in Italy, to negotiate <b>an</b> alliance as <b>common</b> <b>enemies</b> of Rome. However, Rome discovered the agreement when Philip's emissaries were captured by a Roman fleet. The First Macedonian War saw the Romans involved directly in only limited land operations, but they ultimately achieved their objective of pre-occupying Philip and preventing him from aiding Hannibal.|$|R
25|$|Trita Parsi, in {{the book}} Treacherous Alliance: The Secret Dealings of Israel, Iran, and the United States, writes that a senior Israeli {{official}} met with {{a representative of the}} Ayatollah Khomeini in France one month prior to the Israeli attack. The source of the assertion is Ari Ben-Menashe, a former Israeli government employee. At the alleged meeting, the Iranians explained details of their 1980 attack on the site, and agreed to let Israeli planes land at an Iranian airfield in Tabriz {{in the case of an}} emergency. While the new Iranian government was officially hostile to Israel, due to both nations having <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>enemy</b> (Iraq), and Iranian fears that the Iraqis would create an atomic bomb to use on them, they clandestinely worked with Israel to forestall such a development.|$|E
25|$|As Bryan being pinned led to {{the loss}} of the tag team titles, Bryan became obsessed about proving that he was not the weak link of Team Hell No and, as a result, Bryan became even more aggressive, but his overzealous {{behavior}} led to Team Hell No losing their rematch against Rollins and Reigns on the May 27 episode of Raw. When Kane tried to reassure Bryan, he replied with harsh rebukes that alienated Kane from him and, as a result, Bryan was paired with Randy Orton despite their poor relationship to face <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>enemy</b> in The Shield. During this storyline, Bryan was praised as the best performer in WWE and having an unmatched connection with crowds by critics, peers and veterans of the professional wrestling industry.|$|E
25|$|A foreign {{intelligence}} service, {{similar to the}} Central Intelligence Agency of the United States and MI6 of the United Kingdom, has never been established in Canada. However, {{through a number of}} agencies and through its Foreign Affairs postings, it has provided considerable political and economic intelligence to Ottawa decision makers. Whether most Canadians recognize it or not, this has very much blurred the boundaries as to what is required before a {{foreign intelligence}} service (FIS) is said to exist. For better or for worse, the debate on this topic has not received as much attention in Canada as it has around the world. Thinking has been that, {{due to the lack of}} clear and present danger to Canada, the high cost and political risk involved, such an agency is not a necessity. However, supporters of a dedicated Canadian agency noted that Canada could not rely on its interests coinciding with those of the UK and USA which supplied its intelligence, in contrast to the Cold War period when they shared <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>enemy.</b> A dedicated agency might also boost Canada's international standing and increase its global influence.|$|E
40|$|Quantifying {{the role}} of space and spatial scale on the {{population}} dynamics of ecological assemblages is a contemporary challenge in ecology. Here, we evaluate {{the role of}} metapopulation dynamics on the persistence and dynamics of a multispecies predator-prey assemblage where two prey species shared <b>a</b> <b>common</b> natural <b>enemy</b> (apparent competition). By partitioning the effects of increased resource availability {{from the effects of}} metapopulation structure on regional population persistence we show that space has a marked impact on the dynamics of apparent competition in multispecies predator-prey assemblages. Further, the role of habitat size and stochasticity are also shown to influence the dynamics and persistence of this multispecies interaction. The broader consequences of these processes are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Count Iblis's tricks {{are being}} uncovered. Apollo learns {{that there is}} a {{scientific}} explanation behind the sudden growth of the plants on the farm ships (the mysterious light ships give off radiation and the plants were affected when they flew past the farm ship), and Adama remembers that the Colonials have latent psychokinetic abilities. Baltar, fearful of <b>a</b> powerful new <b>common</b> <b>enemy,</b> had come to the fleet to discuss the appearance of the Lights under a flag of truce. Although Iblis had had no direct effect on any of these occurrences, it is too late. The Quorum of the Twelve is considering giving Iblis the presidency.|$|R
