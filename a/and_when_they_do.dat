Like Alan Moore's {{character}} V who inspired Anonymous to adopt the Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never quite sure if Anonymous is the hero or antihero. The trickster is attracted to change {{and the need for}} change, and that's where Anonymous goes. But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, there are rules. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> something, it never goes quite as planned.

The most common congenital abnormalities associated with warfarin use in late pregnancy are central nervous system disorders, including spasticity and seizures, and eye defects. Because of such later pregnancy birth defects, anticoagulation with warfarin poses a problem in pregnant women requiring warfarin for vital indications, such as stroke prevention in those with artificial heart valves.|$|E

25|$|Articles about {{alcohol and}} the risk of traffic crashes (4.7). The writers argue that people who drink and drive rarely have crashes <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> it is not {{necessarily}} related to alcohol or that, for the many drivers who are tense and highly strung, alcohol relaxes them and they drive more safely.|$|E
25|$|Applications {{may also}} provide both interfaces, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> the GUI {{is usually a}} WIMP wrapper around the {{command-line}} version. This is especially common with applications designed for Unix-like operating systems. The latter used to be implemented first because it allowed the developers to focus exclusively on their product's functionality without bothering about interface details such as designing icons and placing buttons. Designing programs this way also allows users to run the program in a shell script.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} {{pattern has}} emerged in criminal cases.

Some critics of the use of unreliable science in court argue that Daubert has had beneficial effects in civil litigation, but fails to address the underlying pathologies of the forensic science system that leads to dubious verdicts in criminal cases.|$|E

25|$|Casaubon escapes {{the museum}} through the Paris sewers, {{eventually}} fleeing {{to the countryside}} villa where Belbo had grown up. It is unclear by this point how reliable a narrator Casaubon has been, {{and to what extent}} he has been inventing, or deceived by, conspiracy theories. Casaubon soon learns that Diotallevi succumbed to his cancer at midnight on St. John's Eve, coincidentally the same time Belbo died. The novel ends with Casaubon meditating on the events of the book, apparently resigned to the (possibly delusional) idea that the Tres will capture him soon. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> he will follow Belbo's lead, refusing to give them any clues, refusing to create a lie. While waiting, holed up in a farmhouse where Belbo lived years before, he finds an old manuscript by Belbo, a sort of diary. He discovers that Belbo had a mystical experience at the age of twelve, in which he perceived ultimate meaning beyond signs and semiotics. He realizes that much of Belbo's behavior and possibly his creation of the Plan and even his death was inspired by Belbo's desire to recapture that lost meaning.|$|E

The head of HBO Documentary Films, Sheila Nevins, commented that when she saw the adverts she knew that Going Clear would be a big success: [...] "Docs don’t get full page ads, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> they do really well." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{somewhat}} related {{point is}} often made by UN member {{states from the}} developing world, who complain {{that some of the}} most desirable senior posts within the Secretariat are filled under a [...] "tradition" [...] of regional representation that favors the United States and other affluent nations. The point has been made forcefully by Ambassador Munir Akram of Pakistan, who was recently head of the G-77. [...] "The major countries, the major powers hold very high positions in the Secretariat and support their national interests and refuse to allow the Secretary General to cut departments," [...] he claims. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> ask for budget cuts, they do it [...] "where it does not affect their national interests." [...] He labels this [...] "a double standard which is applied or is thought to be applied in the Secretariat, and we as overseers of the G-77 do not accept this double standard." ...|$|E

The continents are facing serious problems that threaten their existence; the protagonist and his growing party work to resolve the problems, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> the continents reappear in the present. When all the continents are finally restored, the Demon Lord, who is responsible for the loss of many of the continents, appears and seals away many of the continents again.

2500|$|Berlioz's {{style is}} one of the most {{idiosyncratic}} of the 19th century. The characteristics of his music do not always take immediate effect and a familiarity is regarded as essential to its understanding. Berlioz's claim to be an inspired and natural melodist is irrefutable. Few of his melodies fall into regular phrase lengths, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> they sound uncharacteristic. But perhaps what is [...] "characteristic" [...] of Berlioz's style is the way in which it cannot necessarily be tamped down. For example, Berlioz found the regular balance of four- and eight-bar phrases uncongenial. Sometimes his melodies expand to great length, or fill an entire movement in one long arch. Much of his melodic strength is built on small chromatic inflections.|$|E
2500|$|Due to this {{dearth of}} {{performance}} opportunities, aspiring euphonium {{players in the}} United States are in a rather inconvenient position when seeking future employment. [...] Often, college players must either obtain a graduate degree {{and go on to}} teach at the college level, or audition for one of the major or regional military service bands. Because these bands are relatively few in number and the number of euphonium positions in the bands is small (2–4 in most service bands), job openings do not occur very often <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> are highly competitive; before the current slate of openings in four separate bands, the last opening for a euphonium player in an American service band was in May 2004. A career strictly as a solo performer, unaffiliated with any university or performing ensemble, is a very rare sight, but some performers, such as Riki McDonnell, have managed to do it.|$|E
2500|$|Dallas is {{devoid of}} any major street grid as a whole, though {{a number of major}} {{attempts}} intersect at awkward angles and in confusing interchanges around the city. [...] The main street grid in the center city runs 45° to the typical N/S/E/W grid, creating confusion for many out-of-town visitors. [...] This street grid prevails primarily in east Dallas, though it also permeates Oak Lawn, portions of downtown, and the Cedars. [...] Another much smaller street grid lies downtown between Pacific and Young streets [...] it is about 15° off the typical N/S/E/W grid, and is on average 5-8 streets across N/S and about [...] wide E/W. [...] There is also a fairly extensive N/S/E/W grid around the original city of Oak Cliff. [...] The rest of Dallas, developed {{from the middle of the}} 20th century on, is typically on a N/S/E/W grid, especially with major thoroughfares. [...] In trying to make the city traversable, city planners have over time created wide boulevards that jump between the rights-of-way of multiple minor streets, trying to force a wide road wherever they can discover space for it. [...] This forces the destruction of the minor streets' original paths, a name-change for the boulevard or minor streets, and roads (e.g. , , [...] ) that exist in two or more places. [...] Major thoroughfares in Oak Cliff typically do not cross the Trinity River, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> they frequently do not continue with the same name on the north or eastern sides, which creates a degree of confusion. [...] Also, many times a street will change names each time it crosses a municipal border. Conversely, many streets keep their names through sharp turns across the city.|$|E

50|$|Rape-In, the playwrights’ first show, {{began as}} a {{workshop}} project {{at the suggestion of}} a male playwright in a then-mixed Westbeth playwrights' group.

2500|$|At bar 65 {{the first}} violins hit middle C, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> they cease playing the A minor scale and simply play C {{continuously}} {{until the end}} of the piece (i.e., for more than 250 beats). Eleven bars later the second violins hit a low A and play that continuously. Similarly the other voices gradually find the note that they have been seeking and once reached, they play it continuously until the end. The last to lock into place are the contrabasses which alight on a low A in bar 103. At this stage the whole ensemble is playing an A minor chord very very loudly, and this continues for five bars, then on the second beat of the last bar they suddenly stop. At that moment the bell is struck very quietly (pianissimo) so that the striking itself is not heard, but only the reverberations as it dies away. [...] As the final bell toll reverberates, with all other instruments silent, the overtones of the bell become prominently audible – in particular, the fourth overtone (fifth partial), which is the note C-sharp, i.e., the major third of the fundamental pitch (A) of the entire piece. [...] This creates a striking effect, as the entire piece is set in the key of A minor, so that in the dying echoes of the final bell, the last thing the listener hears is actually an A major chord contained within the overtones of the bell. [...] This evokes the common Renaissance and Baroque technique called the [...] "Picardy third", in which a piece set in a minor mode or key nonetheless ends on a major chord, evoking a ray of light piercing through the clouds, and suggesting hope, resurrection, or redemption. [...] Here, however, the effect is subtle, because it arises solely from the overtones of a single strike of the bell, rather than from separate instruments or voices.|$|E
