2500|$|According to surveys, it {{is common}} for people to feel their dreams <b>are</b> <b>predicting</b> {{subsequent}} life events. Psychologists have explained these experiences in terms of memory biases, namely a selective memory for accurate predictions and distorted memory so that dreams are retrospectively fitted onto life experiences. The multi-faceted nature of dreams makes it easy to find connections between dream content and real events. The term [...] "veridical dream" [...] has been used to indicate dreams that reveal or contain truths not yet known to the dreamer, whether future events or secrets.|$|E
2500|$|Photovoltaics (PV) uses {{solar cells}} {{assembled}} into solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity. It's a fast-growing technology doubling its worldwide installed capacity {{every couple of}} years. PV systems range from small, residential and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations, to large utility-scale photovoltaic power station. The predominant PV technology is crystalline silicon, while thin-film solar cell technology accounts for about 10 percent of global photovoltaic deployment. In recent years, PV technology has improved its electricity generating efficiency, reduced the installation cost per watt {{as well as its}} energy payback time, and has reached grid parity in at least 30 different markets by 2014. Financial institutions <b>are</b> <b>predicting</b> a second solar [...] "gold rush" [...] in the near future.|$|E

2500|$|Reports {{surfaced}} of Chinese women {{giving birth}} to their second child overseas, a practice known as birth tourism. Many went to Hong Kong, which is exempt from the one-child policy. Likewise, a Hong Kong passport differs from China mainland passport by providing additional advantages. Recently though, the Hong Kong government has drastically reduced the quota of births set for non-local women in public hospitals. [...] As a result, fees for delivering babies there have surged. As further admission cuts or a total ban on non-local births in Hong Kong are being considered, mainland agencies that arrange for expectant mothers to give birth overseas <b>are</b> <b>predicting</b> a surge in those going to North America.|$|E
2500|$|A {{string of}} {{favorable}} vintages {{in the late}} 1990s led to an increase of price for Barolos and, in turn, led to increased plantings. Between 1990 and 2004 there was a 47% increase in Nebbiolo plantings in the Barolo zone with [...] under vine. Production subsequently increased from 7 million bottles in the mid-1990s to 10.25 million bottles in the mid-2000s. In the rush to increase plantings some of the less ideal sites previously used by Barbera and Dolcetto were gobbled up. It {{remains to be seen}} if these sites will be able to adequately ripen Nebbiolo enough to produce quality Barolo that justifies the high price of the wine. Some experts <b>are</b> <b>predicting</b> a market correction similar to what was seen in the 1980s when a backlog of vintages caused prices to stabilize.|$|E

There are many resources and activities educators and instructors of reading can use to help with reading strategies in specific content areas and disciplines. Some examples are graphic organizers, talking to the text, anticipation guides, double entry journals, interactive reading and note taking guides, chunking, and summarizing.|$|E

40|$|Predictions of alpha heating in L-mode and H-mode DT plasmas in ITER are {{generated}} using the PTRANSP code. The baseline toroidal field of 5. 3 T, plasma current ramped to 15 MA and a flat {{electron density profile}} ramped to Greenwald fraction 0. 85 are assumed. Various combinations of external heating by negative ion neutral beam injection, ion cyclotron resonance, and electron cyclotron resonance are assumed to start half-way up the density ramp. The time evolution of plasma temperatures and, for some cases, toroidal rotation <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> assuming GLF 23 and boundary parameters. Significant toroidal rotation and flow-shearing rates <b>are</b> <b>predicted</b> by GLF 23 even in the L-mode phase with low boundary temperatures, and the alpha heating power <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to <b>be</b> significant if the power threshold for the transition to H-mode {{is higher than the}} planned total heating power.
