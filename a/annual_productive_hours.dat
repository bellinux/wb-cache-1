40|$|BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue can be {{measured}} as both a unidimensional and a multidimensional construct. Unidimensional fatigue and its symptom correlates have undergone some previous investigation; however, minimal research has considered the differential effect of correlates on individual dimensions of fatigue. The objective {{of the current study}} was to investigate cancer-related fatigue in a radiotherapy sample using a multidimensional conceptualization to determine whether correlates of fatigue are consistent across all dimensions or whether each fatigue dimension has its own unique pattern of correlates. METHODS: The study used a prospective cohort design with data collected from radiotherapy patients at 3 time points; before, after, and 6 weeks after radiotherapy treatment. RESULTS: A total of 210 participants were enrolled in the study. Results indicated the following relations. Increased general fatigue was found to be associated with lower performance status, being in a de facto relationship, depression, having treatment to the brain, and reduced vigorous physical activity. Increased physical fatigue was associated with lower performance status, depression, reduced physical activity, reduced <b>productive</b> <b>hours,</b> and nausea. Higher levels of reduced activity were associated with depression, decreased participation in activities of daily living, decreased number of <b>productive</b> <b>hours,</b> and lower performance status. Higher levels of reduced motivation were associated with radiotherapy to the brain, reduced moderate physical activity, and depression. Increased mental fatigue was associated with diagnosis of a brain tumor, anxiety, depression, and sleep problems. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study support the recognition of multiple dimensions of fatigue, because each dimension examined had various correlates. These findings further develop our understanding of fatigue and may help clinicians provide more targeted information to people with cancer-related fatigue. Furthermore, these results can guide the development of group or individually tailored interventions that ultimately may reduce the impact of this distressing symptom on people with cancer.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the value of}} optimizing lot sizing to meet part demand {{within the limits of}} machine capacity, focusing on a method for improving productivity within the CNC turning and CNC milling departments at the Waters Corporation Machining Center in Milford, Massachusetts. A detailed study of the machining center revealed problems with low machine utilization in turning and milling, low on-time delivery performance and a need for day-to-day adjustments to the production schedule. These problems were attributed to inefficient data collection and use of data, poor production scheduling, and lot sizing that the system's capacity could not handle, causing frequent occurrence of redundant part setups and enabling delays in turning and milling which cascaded to downstream processes. This thesis {{addresses the}} latter problem by implementing optimized lot sizing for ten selected part types going through the turning and milling departments; the system design called for increases to the lot sizes of five of these part types. In order to prevent increased lot sizes from causing unforeseen problems in downstream processes, the project further implemented a supermarket for these selected parts at the end of milling operations, in order to decouple turning and milling from other processes. The lot sizing methodology focused on parts going through a turning operation followed by a milling one, with selected part types being machined on one of two machines in each department. In order to limit increases to work-in-progress inventory caused by increased lot sizes, the supermarket was designed to be managed by a Kanban-based pull system using a modified (Q, R) inventory policy with an expected weekly service level of 95 %. Over the course of the implementation period, the lot sizing methodology saved an estimated 36. 75 hours of setup time for parts made in 407. 25 <b>productive</b> <b>hours</b> of run time. Moreover, a simulation over a year-long period estimates that with the new lot sizes, the machines in question will achieve an aggregated increase in <b>productive</b> <b>hours</b> of nearly 10 %. by Arjun Subramani Chandar.

The second largest production crop in the EU 28 is wheat, although here, too, a reduction can be observed when the data for the last 5 years is examined.

Respondents considered the most effective performance measure to be net expense per meal and food cost per meal.

However, very few new cable logging contractors that have started {{over the last}} two decades have been successful in sustaining their operation. The absence of advanced planning, contract management, lack of skilled labor and labor turnover issues has led to inefficient operations that cannot survive financially.

The recent growth phase has seen a rapid increase in mine and export capacity, with many new and upgraded plants operating at high throughput and utilisation.

To support this, a programme of modifying designs was executed to improve conveyor transfer chute and belt life, which identified a need to challenge the industry practice for specification of designs to improve the functionality of the installed equipment. While acknowledging the importance of selecting the highest wear resistant materials for the intended application, this paper investigates design criteria related to decreasing conveyor transfer and belt wear.

They cannot {{afford to pay for}} the huge investment needed to bring electricity to them. Even if the electricity was brought to them, most can barely afford to pay for usage. This problem can only be addressed by providing tools that bring wealth to the communities.

Solar lighting is significant for many without electricity and the developed solution allows the Sun to pay to eradicate expensive unsustainable on-grid energy. The container based solution empowers the community to create jobs and generate wealth while producing affordable and durable products due to reduced distribution and marketing costs. In existing and emerging markets, the gross product cost includes the costs of distribution which is well developed in existing markets but poorly developed in the emerging African market. Additionally, existing markets innovate incrementally (features of products) whilst emerging markets innovate radically (sustainable technology).

Eleven forest sites were selected in coppices located in Castilla y León (Spain). Three systems were employed for harvesting: a mechanised whole tree harvesting (WTH) system, which included chipping at landing; a fully mechanised cut-to-length (CTL) harvesting system for firewood; and a semi-mechanised CTL system with manual felling and bunching. Three WTH trials had a hauling off 34. 7 ? 44. 1 oven-dried tonnes (odt) ha? 1. In contrast, only 11. 6 ? 30. 0 odt ha? 1 were obtained in the other eight CTL trials.

Ruminant digestive apparatus shows high degree of structural and functional variability, reached by means of evolutionary steps; Hofmann demonstrated the occurrence of seasonal adaptations of the digestive system in relation to forage availability and climatic conditions. Anatomical researches, supporting eco-vegetational investigations focused on the maintenance of pastoral ecosystem biodiversity demonstrated modifications of the sheep rumen related to the vegetative cycle of pasture and to interannual climatic differences. At rumen level, four indicative regions were monitored: atrium, dorsal and ventral sac, and dorsocaudal blindsac floor. All regions showed modification linked to different stages of pasture vegetative cycle. We observed macroscopic modifications in papillae mean area, which directly affects the Surface Enlargement Factor during the pasture vegetative cycle, also linked to interannual climatic variations.

Rumen ventral sac was the rumen region showing macro- and microscopical modification mainly related to pasture qualitative and quantitative changes.
