5|$|The {{fragmentary notes}} for the {{remainder}} of the novel indicate two different trajectories for the plot and five separate conclusions. In both major plot arcs, George Venables wins a lawsuit against Darnford for seducing his wife; Darnford then abandons Maria, flees England, and takes another mistress. When she discovers this treachery, Maria loses the child she was carrying by Darnford (either through an <b>abortion</b> <b>or</b> a miscarriage). In one ending, Maria commits suicide. In another, more complete ending, Maria is saved from suicide by Jemima who has found her first daughter. Maria agrees to live for her child (as Wollstonecraft herself had done after her second suicide attempt). Jemima, Maria and Maria's daughter form a new family.|$|E
5|$|As {{the family}} eats breakfast the next morning, Lois reveals her {{intention}} {{to become a}} surrogate mother for Naomi and Dale, causing Peter to become upset {{at the thought of}} her being pregnant for nine months. Despite this, Lois decides to go to Dr. Hartman to have the in vitro fertilization performed, enduring more of Dr. Hartman's shtick involving celebrity crossbreeds and having a tribe of bush men implant the egg with blowguns. A pregnancy test comes back positive the next day, and a furious Peter attempts to cause Lois to have a miscarriage before ultimately confronting her about the pregnancy. While she continues asserting her intention to provide a child to Naomi and Dale, Quahog 5 News suddenly reveals that Naomi and Dale died in a car crash on Interstate 95. Devastated by the announcement, Lois questions whether she should have an <b>abortion</b> <b>or</b> continue with the pregnancy and put the baby up for adoption.|$|E

40|$|The antiphospholipid {{syndrome}} {{was initially}} described in 1986. To reassess {{the validity of}} antiphospholipid antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 95 patients with SLE were studied. Their antiphospholipid antibody profile was analysed and correlated with clinical findings such as thrombosis, <b>abortions,</b> <b>or</b> thrombocytopenia. A low prevalence of these antibodies was found (13 patients; 14 %) with a high specificity for thrombosis (92 %) and abortions (92 %). The importance of anticardiolipin antibodies as {{a risk factor for}} thrombosis <b>or</b> <b>abortions,</b> <b>or</b> both, in patients with SLE is reaffirmed by this work...|$|R
25|$|Many pro-life {{groups in}} the United States {{actively}} campaigned against the approval of mifepristone and continue to actively campaign for its withdrawal. They cite either ethical issues with <b>abortion</b> <b>or</b> safety concerns regarding the drug and the adverse reactions associated with it. Religious and pro-life groups outside the United States have also protested mifepristone, especially in Germany and Australia.|$|E
25|$|A {{laparoscopy}} or laparotomy {{can also}} be performed to visually confirm an ectopic pregnancy. This is generally reserved for women presenting with signs of an acute abdomen and/or hypovolemic shock. Often if a tubal <b>abortion</b> <b>or</b> tubal rupture has occurred, {{it is difficult to}} find the pregnancy tissue. A laparoscopy in very early ectopic pregnancy rarely shows a normal looking fallopian tube.|$|E

25|$|In 1873, {{after the}} {{lobbying}} attempts of Anthony Comstock, head of New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, the U.S. Congress amended a pre-existing law and enacted the Comstock Act, {{which made it}} a crime to knowingly mail obscene materials or advertisements and information about obscene materials, <b>abortion,</b> <b>or</b> contraception. This act adopted the Hicklin test for deeming which materials would be considered obscene.|$|E
25|$|Although the Sikh code {{of conduct}} does not deal {{directly}} with <b>abortion</b> (<b>or</b> indeed many other bioethical issues), it is generally forbidden in Sikhism because {{it is said to}} interfere with the creative work of God. Despite this theoretical viewpoint, abortion is not uncommon among the Sikh community in India, and there is growing concern that female fetuses are being aborted because of the cultural preference for sons.|$|E
25|$|Various {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} as possible reasons for sex-selective abortion. Culture is favored by some researchers, while some favor disparate gender-biased access to resources. Some demographers question whether sex-selective <b>abortion</b> <b>or</b> infanticide claims are accurate, because underreporting of female births may also explain high sex ratios. Natural reasons may also {{explain some of the}} abnormal sex ratios. Klasen and Wink suggest India and China’s high sex ratios are primarily the result of sex-selective abortion.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, a {{study in}} Arkansas and Arizona {{found that there was}} no {{significant}} difference in birth rates.

In 2012, Feng Jianmei, a villager from central China's Shaanxi province was forced into an abortion by local officials after her family refused to pay the fine for having a second child. Chinese authorities have since apologized and two officials were fired, while five others were sanctioned.|$|E

50|$|During the {{government}} of Enver Hoxha, communist Albania had a natalist policy, leading women to have illegal <b>abortions</b> <b>or</b> to induce them on their own.

25|$|The National Assembly {{passed the}} law banning {{therapeutic}} abortions on 26 October 2006. It is widely {{expected that the}} president will sign it.

25|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{spontaneous}} abortion during the first trimester is chromosomal abnormalities of the embryo or fetus, accounting for at least 50% of sampled early pregnancy losses. Other causes include vascular disease (such as lupus), diabetes, other hormonal problems, infection, and abnormalities of the uterus. Advancing maternal age and a woman's history of previous spontaneous abortions are the two leading factors associated with a greater risk of spontaneous abortion. A spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental trauma; intentional trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is considered induced <b>abortion</b> <b>or</b> feticide.|$|E
25|$|Nowhere in Australia {{is there}} a {{requirement}} that a woman's sexual partner be notified of a proposed <b>abortion</b> <b>or</b> to consent to the procedure. Australian courts will not grant an injunction to restrain a pregnant woman from terminating her pregnancy, even if the applicant is the putative father of the fetus. There is also no waiting period for an abortion. A minor {{does not need to}} notify a parent of a proposed abortion nor is parental consent required, except in Western Australia. In Western Australia, a proposed abortion by a minor under 16 years of age must be notified to one of the parents, except where permission has been granted by the Children's Court or the minor does not live with her parents.|$|E
25|$|A {{book can}} be {{prohibited}} by the Censorship of Publications Board if they consider {{it to be}} indecent or obscene. A periodical can be prohibited if it {{is considered to be}} frequently or usually indecent or obscene, or if the Board is of the opinion that an unduly large proportion of space in the periodical is given to matters related to crime. A book or periodical may also be prohibited if the Board considers that they advocate <b>abortion</b> <b>or</b> ways of carrying out abortions. Most of the publications considered by the Board have been reported because of obscenity. When considering a book, the Board measures its literary, scientific and historical merit and takes note of its general tenor, the language in which it is written and its likely circulation and audience.|$|E
