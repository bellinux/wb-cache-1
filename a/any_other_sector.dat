5|$|Landlords {{generally}} divided their estates {{into smaller}} farms that they rented to tenant farmers. Tenant farmers were generally on one-year leases, {{and could be}} evicted even if they paid their rents. Some of the tenants were large farmers who farmed over , but the majority were much smaller—on average between 15 and 50 acres (0.06–0.20km2). Many small farmers worked as labourers on the larger farms. The poorest agricultural workers were the landless labourers, {{who worked on the}} land of other farmers.

2500|$|Construction {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{dangerous}} occupations in the world, incurring more occupational fatalities than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>sector</b> in both the United States and in the European Union. In 2009, the fatal occupational injury rate among construction workers in the United States was nearly three times that for all workers. Falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers. Proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry. Due to the fact that accidents may have disastrous consequences for employees as well as organizations, it is of utmost importance to ensure health and safety of workers and compliance with HSE construction requirements. Health and safety legislation in the construction industry involves many rules and regulations.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{renewable}} energy policies is to reduce CO 2 emissions by promoting the deployment of renewable technologies. Since the electricity sector emits more CO 2 than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>sectors,</b> these policies will help promote the production of clean electricity. However, producing electricity from renewable energy sources is currently more expensive than conventional technologies, {{which means that the}} implementation of renewable policies would incur costs to the society. For this reason it is important to identify which renewable policy can be used to achieve CO 2 reductions at a least cost to the society. In this study, three main policies pertinent to electricity markets are analyzed. They are: renewable portfolio standard (RPS), feed in tariff (FIT), and cap and trade (CAT). First of all, by using an economic equilibrium model, the social surplus and CO 2 emissions from a perfectly-competitive electricity market are calculated. Then from the application of the different CO 2 reduction policies and their requirements, the amount of social surplus reduction per CO 2 ton avoided is obtained. Finally the cost to the society of avoiding CO 2 ton emissions are derived and analyzed. Such an analysis is to be further extended to consider the effects of endogenous learning on renewable technology development and to model endogenously the impacts (measured in dollar terms) from the increase of CO 2 emissions. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Hospital drug formularies (HDFs) {{are widely}} used tools to help {{influence}} clinicians' prescribing behaviour. Besides the therapeutic quality of HDFs, the available information {{and the way in}} which this is presented are key factors in HDFs' success or failure to influence prescribing behaviour and enhance prescribing quality. This research evaluates the technical features and organisational information of Dutch HDFs. Methods: Seventy-two (75 %) of all Dutch HDFs were evaluated based on criteria retrieved from international literature and additional criteria drafted by occupational groups working with HDFs. Aspects that were studied were physical appearance and layout, practicability with respect to the available information and how easily this could be retrieved from the HDFs, information regarding drug choice policies such as seamless care, and the available type of therapeutic and pharmaceutical information. Results: Thirty-three (46 %) of the HDFs were less than 3 years old. Physical appearance of all HDFs was very well looked after. Two (3 %) HDFs were disease-oriented rather than drug-oriented. Changes from pre-admission therapy were addressed in 30 (42 %) of the HDFs, but other seamless care policies were addressed in less than 20 % of the HDFs. Finally, less than 50 % provided therapeutic information that clinicians indicated as important. Discussion: Although Dutch HDFs are technically practicable with respect to user-convenience, practice-oriented features are capable of improvements. Furthermore, Dutch HDFs lack important clinical information for daily practice. To enhance seamless care across healthcare, generic prescribing and prescribing on admission from and discharge to <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>sectors</b> should be addressed more specifically...|$|R
