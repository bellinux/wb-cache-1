5|$|Over {{the course}} of his lifetime, Grinsell {{examined}} and catalogued around 10,000 barrows and advanced the archaeological understanding of such monuments. His use of non-excavatory fieldwork influenced much British archaeology {{in the latter part of}} his 20th century, while his willingness to pay attention to other sources of information, such as folklore and place-names, has been deemed to be <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{that was being}} considered was that of armor. Mallory was here somewhat <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time,</b> enthusiastically supporting iron cladding for ships before the fledgling metals industry in the country could supply it in the requisite quantities. No armored vessels were commissioned {{while he was in}} the Senate, but whatever fault there was lay elsewhere. He spoke up for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended for the defense of New York Harbor; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L. Stevens, it had been laid down in 1842 but was still incomplete in 1853, when Mallory gave his argument. His pleading was unsuccessful in that the Senate did not agree to continue funding the project, but in his supporting speech he expressed some of the principles that guided his thinking when he later became the Confederate Secretary of the Navy.|$|E
5|$|There {{was only}} one public {{pre-season}} friendly on 13 August, which saw the club's first team take on the reserves; it ended with a surprise 4–2 victory for the reserves, Roland Lewis scoring a hat-trick. Pre-season training consisted primarily of assistant manager Ken Fish leading a marathon running session from Burslem to Hanley and back to Burslem following a stop at a pub for a half-pint of shandy. After returning to the ground Fish would organise a practise game. The fitness work was actually crucial to the team's success, as Steele was <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> in that he insisted that wide players should defend when the opposition were on the ball, {{in order to support}} the defence. Superstition was of great importance to Steele, who ensured that the team rigidly stuck their pre-match rituals such as the intricacies of kit layout and the order in which players entered the pitch.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} sites to undergo archaeological {{excavation}} was Stonehenge and other megalithic monuments in England.

50|$|Plagued by illness {{for much}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life since childhood, Simpson {{experienced}} divine healing after understanding {{it to be}} part of the blessing of abiding in Christ as Life and healing. He emphasized healing in his Four Fold Gospel and usually devoted one meeting a week for teaching, testimonies and prayer on these lines.

50|$|In 1936 Kuryłowicz {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} syntactic transformation, pointing {{at the same time}} that this syntactic (transformative) derivation does not change the meaning of syntactic form. Therefore, if we take the sentence like: Kate washes the car.and change it into passive:The car is washed by Kate.we can notice that the second sentence has the same meaning as the first one. They differ just in terms of style. The idea of transformative derivation proves that Kuryłowicz was <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>times,</b> because what he described resembles one of the main assumptions of Chomsky’s Transformative - Generative Grammar postulated several years later.|$|R

But his moral superiority was reduced too by the violent means, including fratricides, by which he sought to suppress opposition; he at times was extremely despotic and unpredictable, even by the standards <b>of</b> <b>his</b> age. In this he was preceded by his father Alfonso XI, who since the crisis at the death of Alfonso X had faced multiple rebellions against royal authority.|$|R

25|$|Brent {{documents}} something Peirce never suspected, {{namely that}} {{his efforts to}} obtain academic employment, grants, and scientific respectability were repeatedly frustrated by the covert opposition of a major Canadian-American scientist of the day, Simon Newcomb.

Conversely, Keith Devlin believes that Peirce's work was too far <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> to be appreciated by the academic establishment of the day and that this played a large role in his inability to obtain a tenured position.|$|E
25|$|In some respects, however, Southey was <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> in {{his views}} on social reform. For example, he was an early critic of the evils which the new factory system brought to early 19th-century Britain. He was appalled by the {{conditions}} of life in towns like Birmingham and Manchester, and especially by the employment of children in factories, and was outspoken in his criticism of these things. He sympathised with the pioneering socialist plans of Robert Owen, advocated that the state promote public works to maintain high employment and called for universal education.|$|E
25|$|In this scene, Mussorgsky is hailed to be <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> musically. His use of {{the whole}} tone scale, which uses only whole steps, made the Coronation scene stand out. This {{technique}} was replicated by impressionistic composers about 20 years later who noted his success. Mussorgsky also combined different two-beat and three-beat meters to create a unique sound for his composition called polymeters. These techniques were uncommon during this era and {{were believed to be}} almost too overwhelming for the public. This led to his rejection on two different occasions by the Imperial Opera before they decided to perform.|$|E

5000|$|Vierthaler's three chief {{pedagogical}} works are: Elemente der Methodik und Padagogik (1791); Geist der Sokratik (1793); Entwurf der Schuler- ziehungskunde (1794). He was {{a master}} in his calling, distinguished by the clearness, simplicity, and practicalness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teachings. He laid more emphasis than other teachers <b>of</b> <b>his</b> era {{on the principle that}} instruction should subserve education. The aim <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pedagogical method was a [...] "noble humanity transfigured by God". The basis <b>of</b> all <b>his</b> efforts was the Catholic Faith which he placed above everything else. Like Overberg he regarded the personality of the teacher as {{the most important thing in}} education. In many respects he was <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>times,</b> e.g. in <b>his</b> high estimation <b>of</b> the teaching of the natural sciences and of physical training; also in his opposition to corporal punishment.

Today, many publications still refer to his work, notably the landmark 50 mm f/2 Summicron-M lens. And there are numerous other examples that prove how important his work was for the evolution of photographic optics in general and for the evolution of photography at Leitz. This includes his apochromatically corrected telephoto lenses. ... While I was writing these lines, it occurred to me that that I am not qualified to render a judgment of Dr. Mandler." ...|$|R

25|$|However, {{many analysts}} believe {{that even though the}} TFX project itself was a failure, McNamara was <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> as the trend in fighter design has {{continued}} toward consolidation — the F-16 Falcon and F/A-18 Hornet emerged as multi-role fighters, and most modern designs combine many of the roles the TFX would have had. In many ways, the Joint Strike Fighter is seen as a rebirth of the TFX project, in that it purports to satisfy the needs of three American Air arms (as well as several foreign customers), fulfilling the roles of strike fighter, carrier-launched fighter, V/STOL, and close air support (and drawing many criticisms similar to those leveled against the TFX).|$|E

5000|$|If we were {{to examine}} the history of pre-Victorian India, Serfoji's name often pops up at the first instance.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the parody procedures {{employed by}} the Marquis de Sade in descriptions {{of works of art}} (ekphrasis) that are found in the little-known Voyage d’Italie, account of a trip to Italy that the author made in 1775 to escape the persecution of French police. Unpublished until the nineteen sixties, nor taken into account in critical studies, this travel diary provides precious insight into many philosophical and aesthetic categories that were commonly discussed in debates in the pre-Revolutionary period. Following a substantial but fundamental section on the meagre literature about the Voyage, this essay focuses on only a few passages concerning ekphrasis in Sade’s work, enough to show how parody and satire were essential rhetorical conditions in order for the author to overturn the transcendent meaning of the works of arts as it was imposed by the Christian/Neo-platonic aesthetic tradition, which was still ruling on the intellectual milieu of the eighteenth-century grandtouristes. In accordance with the most radical tendencies of the Enlightenment - Diderot’s materialism and Shaftesbury’s philosophy of “wit” provide a good example -, in his literary debut Sade offers an ingenious and inventive framework that is well <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>times</b> and, therefore, deserves further examination...|$|R
