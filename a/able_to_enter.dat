5|$|During the 1960s, {{developments}} {{in the pattern of}} oil transportation indicated that it would soon become most economical to move oil between the Middle East and Europe using ultra large crude carrier (ULCC) vessels. These vessels were so large {{that they would not be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> most of the older ports on the Atlantic Ocean, North Sea, and English Channel coasts.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} intention is critical to joint attention. When individuals understand that others have goals, intentions, and attentional states, they are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> into and direct another's attention. Joint attention promotes and maintains dyadic exchanges and learning {{about the nature of}} social partners. The ability to engage in joint attention is crucial for language development.|$|E
5|$|After {{locating}} the M. schnecki nest, the wasp enters only the nests that contain P. rebeli caterpillars. It is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> the nest without being swarmed because it releases a chemical {{that causes the}} worker ants to attack one another instead of concentrating all their efforts on the wasp. Once the wasp reaches the caterpillars, it marks the individuals most likely to survive by ovipositing in them. Once the wasp's eggs hatch from the caterpillar's body, the newborn offspring feast on the caterpillar's carcass.|$|E

5|$|Four British athletes {{competed in}} alpine skiing {{events at the}} Games. Andy Noble and David Ryding {{qualified}} for two events each whilst Ed Drake and Chemmy Alcott, taking part in her third Olympics, qualified for all five variants. The preparations of Britain's skiers were disrupted {{by the collapse of}} Snowsport GB, but all athletes were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> the games after the intervention of the British Olympic Association. Alcott, considered a realistic contender for a medal, achieved the squad's best finish coming eleventh in the women's combined.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{launched}} repeated {{assaults on}} Vukovar {{but failed to}} make any progress. Its armour, designed for combat in open country, was barely <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> Vukovar's narrow streets. Support from regular infantry was lacking, and the TO's poorly trained and motivated troops were inadequate substitutes. The JNA's soldiers appeared to have little {{understanding of how to}} conduct urban operations and its officers displayed slow and reactive decision-making on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Their roles imposed several design {{limitations}} on the vessels. The vessels were designed to operate in coastal areas, which required a shallow draft {{in order for them}} to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> any port on the Baltic seaboard. They also required a heavy armament, {{in order for them to}} be able to engage any hostile ironclad on equal terms. Because Stosch envisioned only local deployments for the vessels, they had limited coal stowage, as they could easily replenish their supply.|$|E
5|$|A {{trademark}} dispute {{involving the}} owners of the identically named Burger King in Mattoon, Illinois led to a federal lawsuit; the case's outcome helped define the scope of the Lanham act and trademark law in the United States. An existing trademark held by a shop of the same name in South Australia forced the company to change its name in Australia, while another state trademark in Texas forced the company to abandon its signature product, the Whopper, in several counties around San Antonio. The company was only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> northern Alberta, in Canada, in 1995, after it paid the founders of another chain named Burger King.|$|E
5|$|Asthma, chronic bronchitis, {{bronchiectasis}} {{and chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This limits {{the amount of}} air that is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe cases. One common cause of COPD and emphysema is smoking, and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.|$|E

5|$|By mid-December the ship's {{supply of}} flour and butter for the voyage had been {{exhausted}} and Philip authorised Mason to broach the stores {{set aside for}} the future colony in order to continue to feed the convicts. A month later, on 20 January 1788, Prince of Wales reached Australia's Botany Bay. Six days later she sailed for Sydney Cove as part of the relocation of the convict settlement to Port Jackson. Leaving Botany Bay she collided with Friendship, losing her mainmast staysail and topsail, but the damage was swiftly repaired and she was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> Port Jackson in line with her fellow transports. There she landed 49 convicts, 31 marines and 23 civilians.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to pleas from Travis, James Fannin started from Goliad with 320 men, supplies and armaments, yet had to abort {{a day later}} due to a wagon breakdown. Final reinforcements were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> the Alamo during March 1–4, most of them from Gonzales which had become a recruitment camp. Others who had left intending to return were unable to re-enter. At 5:30a.m. on March 6, the Mexican army began the final siege. An hour later, all combatants inside the Alamo were dead. The bodies, {{with the exception of}} Gregorio Esparza's, were cremated on pyres and abandoned. Esparza's brother Francisco was a soldier in the Mexican army and received permission from Santa Anna for a Christian burial.|$|E

When Shallow Grave proved to be a critical success, Boyle was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> pre-production on Trainspotting. He withdrew from Our Friends in the North.

5|$|Arizona was {{commissioned}} into the Navy on 17 October 1916 with John D. McDonald as captain. She departed New York on 10 November 1916 after {{the crew had}} cleaned the ship and the propulsion system had been tested at the dock. After declinating the ship's magnetic compasses, the ship sailed south for her shakedown cruise. Outside Guantanamo Bay, a stripped turbine on 7 December forced the navy to order Arizona back to New York for repairs, although she was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> Chesapeake Bay to test her main and secondary gun batteries on 19–20 December. The turbine could not be repaired inside the ship, so the yard workers had to cut holes in the upper decks to lift the damaged casing out.

5|$|Australian {{operations}} in Phuoc Tuy province continued throughout {{the remainder of}} 1967, and although they were largely successful at the tactical level, the Viet Cong continued to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> most of the villages in the province, and were causing increasingly heavy Allied casualties with mines lifted from the controversial barrier minefield laid by the Australians. Operation Santa Fe, a further large-scale joint US-Australian operation, took place between October and November, but it too ended with only limited success {{in comparison to the}} resources committed. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due to the long-term effects of Australian {{operations in}} the province which had increased the population's sense of security. As a result, 1 ATF now turned its attention to expanding its area of operations.|$|E
