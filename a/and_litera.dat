40|$|SUMMARY: In Arithmeticae summa of Georgius de Hungaria, printed at Schoonhoven, 1499 is {{stated that}} locus, limes, {{differentia}} and figura {{are used for}} {{one and the same}} thing. The Latin word figura has the same meaning as the English word figure, a sign or symbol to denote some numerical value. The Dutch word for figura is cijfer, just like chiffre (French) and Ziffer (German). Synonyms of figura are character elementum <b>and</b> <b>litera</b> inda. Locus is used to express, in a written number, the place of a figure between others. The same meaning have mansio, statio and species,  although the use of these is known in only one case. The word differentia expresses that the value of a figure differs according to the place of that figure between others. This fact is a consequence of the new manner to write a number in the decimal positional system. So « scribe numerum per suas differentias » is the usual way to say, {{during the second half of}} the middle ages : write a number by his figures. which figures have different values according to their place. Limes is the word to denote the various orders in a number, the units (the first limes), the tens (the second limes), the hundreds (the third limes) and so on...|$|E
