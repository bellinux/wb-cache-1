5|$|Substrate: Novisuccinea chittenangoensis <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> calciphile, {{requiring}} a substrate either derived from limestone dolomite or rich in calcium carbonate from other sources.

Natural genetic transformation <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> adaptation for repair of DNA damage that also generates genetic diversity.|$|R
5000|$|NGC 956 <b>is</b> what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> open cluster in the constellation Andromeda.

5|$|A new extant genus {{discovered}} in 2014, Dendrogramma, which <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> basal metazoan but of unknown taxonomic placement, {{has been noted}} to have similarities with the Ediacaran fauna. It has since {{been found to be}} a siphonophore, possibly even sections of a more complex species, though this in turn has raised suspicions for a similar status for at least some ediacaran organisms.|$|E
5|$|A {{triangular}} banner {{appearing to}} depict a bird (possibly a raven) appears on a penny minted by Olaf Cuaran around 940. The coin features a roughly right isosceles triangular standard, {{with the two}} equilateral sides situated {{at the top and}} staff, respectively. Along the hypotenuse are a series of five tabs or tassels. The staff is topped by what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cross; this may indicate a fusion of pagan and Christian symbolism.|$|E
5|$|A. r. scottii, {{described}} by George Sennett in 1888, is found from northern Arizona to New Mexico south to northeastern Sonora and northwestern Coahuila.

5|$|Calcitriol, {{the active}} {{metabolite}} of vitamin D3, <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> catalyst for glutathione production. Calcitriol {{was found to}} increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration. It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the European {{population}} of the European nightjar range from 470,000 to more than 1million birds, suggesting a total global {{population of}} 2–6million individuals. Although there <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fall in numbers, it is not rapid enough to trigger the vulnerability criteria. The huge breeding range and population mean that this species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of gross anatomy, the cerebellar cortex <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> homogeneous sheet of tissue, and, from {{the viewpoint}} of microanatomy, all parts of this sheet appear to have the same internal structure. There are, however, a number of respects in which the structure of the cerebellum is compartmentalized. There are large compartments that are generally known as zones; these can be divided into smaller compartments known as microzones.|$|E
5|$|In {{depressed}} {{people who}} experience symptoms of sleepiness and fatigue, bupropion {{has been found}} to be more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in alleviating these symptoms.

5|$|The character's origins lie of the {{accounts}} of Kings Duff and Duncan in Holinshed's Chronicles (1587), a history of Britain familiar to Shakespeare.

5|$|Toniná's history {{comes into}} {{focus in the}} Late Classic, when its {{historical}} record is more fully represented by hieroglyphic texts. In 633 K'inich Hix Chapat is recorded as installing two subordinate lords but little else is known of his reign, although he was probably enthroned in 595.

The European edible frog is a semi-permanent hybrid between pool frogs and marsh frogs; its population requires the continued presence of {{at least one of the}} parent species. Cave paintings indicate that the European bison is a natural hybrid of the aurochs and the steppe bison.|$|E

50|$|Migraines with aura <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{risk factor}} for ischemic stroke {{doubling}} the risk. <b>Being</b> <b>a</b> young adult, being female, using hormonal birth control, and smoking further increases this risk.

Overall however migraines do not <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> {{increase the risk of}} death from stroke or heart disease. Preventative therapy of migraines in those with migraines with auras may prevent associated strokes.
