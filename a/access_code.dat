5|$|When {{someone is}} {{within range of}} a trap, a sensor bar will move into a red zone. Activating the trap at this moment will capture them. If the trap is {{activated}} when the bar {{is not in the}} red zone, the trap will not work and will become disabled {{for a short period of}} time. The traps will also only work if the <b>access</b> <b>code</b> is correct. There are six possible access codes, and the player must eavesdrop into the conversations to find out when the Martins change the code. When a new code is learned, the player must wait until the speaker leaves the room before changing the <b>access</b> <b>code</b> to the correct color to maintain control of the traps.

5|$|The +3 saw the {{addition}} of two more 16KB ROMs. One was home to {{the second part of}} the reorganised 128 ROM and the other hosted the +3's disk operating system. This was a modified version of Amstrad's PCWDOS (the disk <b>access</b> <b>code</b> used in LocoScript), called +3DOS. These two new 16KB ROMs and the original two 16KB ROMs were now physically implemented together as two 32KB chips. To be able to run CP/M, which requires RAM at the bottom of the address space, the bank-switching was further improved, allowing the ROM to be paged out for another 16KB of RAM.|$|E

40|$|International audienceRandom <b>access</b> <b>coding</b> is an {{information}} task {{that has been}} extensively studied and found many applications in quantum information. In this scenario, Alice receives an n-bit string x, and wishes to encode x into a quantum state ρ x, such that Bob, when receiving the state ρ x, can choose any bit i ∈ [n] and recover the input bit x i with high probability. Here we study a variant called parity-oblivious random <b>access</b> <b>codes,</b> where we impose the cryptographic property that Bob cannot infer any information about the parity of any subset of bits of the input, apart from the single bits x i. We provide the optimal quantum parity-oblivious random <b>access</b> <b>codes</b> and {{show that they are}} asymp-totically better than the optimal classical ones. For this, we relate such encodings to a non-local game and provide tight bounds for the success probability of the non-local game via semidefinite program-ming. We also extend the well-known quantum random <b>access</b> <b>codes</b> for encoding 2 or 3 classical bits into a single qubit. Our results provide a large non-contextuality inequality violation and resolve the main open problem in a work of Spekkens, Buzacott, Keehn, Toner, and Pryde (2009) ...|$|R

40|$|Random <b>access</b> <b>codes</b> are {{important}} {{for a wide range}} of applications in quantum information. However, their implementation with quantum theory can be made in two very different ways: (i) by distributing data with strong spatial correlations violating a Bell inequality, or (ii) using quantum communication channels to create stronger-than-classical sequential correlations between state preparation and measurement outcome. Here, we study this duality of the quantum realization. We present a family of Bell inequalities tailored to the task at hand and study their quantum violations. Remarkably, we show that the use of spatial and sequential quantum correlations imposes different limitations on the performance of quantum random <b>access</b> <b>codes.</b> We also show that there exist random <b>access</b> <b>codes</b> for which spatial quantum correlations offer no gain over classical strategies, whereas sequential quantum correlations can yield an advantage. We discuss the physics behind the observed discrepancy between spatial and sequential quantum correlations...|$|R
5000|$|As {{revealed}} in [...] "Thrill of the Hunt", Ratchet was assigned by Ultra Magnus to rescue an intelligence officer, Arcee, and retrieve <b>access</b> <b>codes</b> {{vital to the}} war effort, when he ran into a Decepticon bounty hunter, Lockdown. Lockdown captured both of them, and took Ratchet's EMP Generator as a trophy. Arcee requested that Ratchet use the generator at full blast to wipe her memory, erasing the <b>access</b> <b>codes</b> in the process. Ratchet did so, but Lockdown's interference overloaded it, completely erasing Arcee's memory. Attempting to restore her memory, Ratchet accidentally uploaded the <b>access</b> <b>codes</b> Arcee was carrying. When Highbrow notices this, he has Ultra Magnus bring Ratchet before the inactive Omega Supreme, with Ratchet taking Arcee's place in teaching Omega prior to being introduced to battle.

However, users who bought the game used {{would have to pay}} for the Cerberus Network separately if they wanted access to the new content.

BioWare online development director Fernando Melo revealed that 11% of all Mass Effect 2s downloadable content revenue came from the Cerberus Network. The policy attracted criticism from some of the fan community, who have criticized downloadable content as being overpriced and an incentive for developers to leave items out of the initial release.|$|E
