Hanks' character was filmed as partially obscured <b>and</b> <b>seen</b> through doorways, and his entrances and exits took place in shadows. A wide lens was used to maintain a distance from the character.|$|E

5|$|Rowland (2009) {{identified}} {{an additional}} mechanism of countershading not previously analysed, namely that a round {{body like a}} cylinder illuminated <b>and</b> <b>seen</b> from above appears to have dark sides. Using a graphics tool, she demonstrated that this effect can be flattened out by countershading. Since predators are known to use edges to identify prey, countershading may therefore, she argues, make prey harder to detect when seen from above.|$|E

5|$|At present, {{the orphanage}} has been heavily vandalised, with {{surrounding}} residents regularly {{calling the police}} because the sounds of windows smashing and people entering without permission can be heard <b>and</b> <b>seen</b> frequently. Small grass fires around the building have also been reported. Restorations have been considered by the Goulburn City Council. The council is holding Ferrara accountable for allowing damage at the orphanage, while he {{has come up with}} many development projects for the lot. As a result, city council has not issued Ferrara any development permits until restoration work to the orphanage is complete.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{a number of}} {{painters}} emphasised landscape in their works, a development led {{in part by the}} shift in preference from religious iconography to secular subjects. Second-generation Netherlandish painters applied the mid-14th-century dictum of natural representation. This was born of the rising affluence of the region's middle class, many of whom had now travelled south <b>and</b> <b>seen</b> countryside noticeably different from their flat homeland. At the same time, the later part of the century saw the emergence of specialisation and a number of masters focused on detailing landscape, most notably Konrad Witz in the mid-15th century, and later Joachim Patinir. Most innovations in this format came from artists living in the Dutch regions of the Burgundian lands, most notably from Haarlem, Leiden and 's-Hertogenbosch. The significant artists from these areas did not slavishly reproduce the scenery before them, but in subtle ways adapted and modified their landscapes to reinforce the emphasis and meaning of the panel they were working on.|$|E

5|$|In October 2002, {{four months}} after Thrud issue 1 was published, Critchlow {{returned}} to 2000AD using his new computer-drawn style. His first story was the Judge Dredd, Out of the Undercity story written by John Wagner. The new style was initially well received by 2000AD Review <b>and</b> <b>seen</b> as a marked improvement over his previous fully painted style with clearer figures and atmospheric colouring. As the Undercity story developed, however, Critchlow was criticised for using too narrow a palette, with too many greys and blues, although {{this might have been}} {{as a result of the}} story being set underground.|$|E
5|$|In the wild, {{little brown}} bats {{can be very}} active during {{the day in the}} spring months, where they can be heard loudly squeaking, {{shuffling}} position <b>and</b> <b>seen</b> hanging out the bottom of the bat house during all hours of the daytime. The average sleep time of a little brown bat in captivity is said to be 19.9 hours per day. This long period of sleep is thought to be a way of conserving energy, by only hunting for a few hours each night when their insect prey are available.|$|E
5|$|Jay and Mark Briscoe {{made their}} debuts for Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) at Delaware Invasion on January 20, 2001, being {{brought in to}} job {{as part of a}} three-on-one {{handicap}} match against Trent Acid. At the inaugural Best of the Best event, a show somewhat atypical of CZW in that it is a tournament spotlighting athletic junior heavyweight wrestling as opposed to violent hardcore matches, the two advanced past the first round in a three-way match with Nick Mondo where the stipulation was whoever took the fall would be eliminated. They were then matched against each other in the second round, with Jay winning and advancing further. This match was seen by fans as the best of the tournament, <b>and</b> <b>seen</b> in retrospect as having been responsible in large part for helping launch the brothers' careers, as they were new to the independent circuit and very young at the time.|$|E

5|$|Quadrophenia was {{released}} {{to a positive}} reception in both the UK and the US, but the resulting tour was marred with problems with backing tapes replacing the additional instruments on the album, and the stage piece was retired in early 1974. It was revived in 1996 with a larger ensemble, and a further tour occurred in 2012. The album made {{a positive impact on}} the mod revival movement of the late 1970s, and the resulting film adaptation, released in 1979, was successful. The album has been reissued on compact disc several times, <b>and</b> <b>seen</b> a number of remixes that corrected some perceived flaws in the original.|$|E
5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections are {{connected}} to Coleridge's The Eolian Harp as the scene for both is the same. The land of Clevedon is praised <b>and</b> <b>seen</b> full of life, and it serves as contrast to escaping {{from the real world}} into fantasy and pondering about the abstract. Both poems also describe Coleridge's relationship with his wife and feelings of sexual desire. The imagination aspects of the poem represent an unwillingness to accept nature on its own and rejects the conclusion of The Eolian Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God, one cannot just simply exist in such an area but must seek out truth.|$|E

5|$|Without a no-trade {{clause in}} his {{contract}} with the Canucks <b>and</b> <b>seen</b> as an emerging offensive defencemen throughout the NHL, Bieksa was routinely the subject of trade rumours. In the 2009 off-season, one such trade rumour was central in a feud between general managers Mike Gillis of Vancouver and Brian Burke of the Toronto Maple Leafs. On a Leafs TV documentary on the 2009 NHL Entry Draft that aired in September 2009, a segment involves Burke speculating that the Canucks had offered Bieksa to the Tampa Bay Lightning in a package that included forward Alexandre Burrows and a first-round draft-choice in exchange for Tampa Bay's second-overall selection. The documentary was immediately pulled from airing again and the Maple Leafs received a warning from the League.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to deep fractures and grooved lanes, Enceladus has several {{other types of}} tectonic terrain. Many of these fractures are found in bands cutting across cratered terrain. These fractures probably propagate down {{only a few hundred}} meters into the crust. Many have probably been influenced during their formation by the weakened regolith produced by impact craters, often changing the strike of the propagating fracture. Another example of tectonic features on Enceladus are the linear grooves first found by Voyager 2 <b>and</b> <b>seen</b> at a much higher resolution by Cassini. These linear grooves can be seen cutting across other terrain types, like the groove and ridge belts. Like the deep rifts, they are among the youngest features on Enceladus. However, some linear grooves have been softened like the craters nearby, suggesting that they are older. Ridges have also been observed on Enceladus, though not nearly to the extent as those seen on Europa. These ridges are relatively limited in extent and are up to one kilometer tall. One-kilometer high domes have also been observed. Given the level of resurfacing found on Enceladus, it is clear that tectonic movement has been an important driver of geology for much of its history.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} common bridge-types built during the Han was the wooden-trestle beam bridge, {{described}} by literary sources <b>and</b> <b>seen</b> in reliefs carved on tomb bricks. Evidence for arch bridges is elusive: one outside of Chengdu's south gate is claimed to date to the Han period, while that built by Ma Xian (馬賢) (fl. 135 CE) was certainly a beam bridge. In artwork, a relief sculpture from a Han tomb in Sichuan province shows an arch bridge with a gradual curve, suggesting that it is segmental, although the use of such bridges are not entirely confirmed. Although there are rare references to simple suspension bridges in Han sources, these are only mentioned in connection with travels to foreign countries in the Himalaya, Hindukush and Afghanistan, demonstrating the antiquity of the invention there. Floating pontoon bridges made of boats secured by iron chains were built during the Han (some even spanning the Yellow River and Yangzi River) and were most often employed for military purposes since they could be easily assembled and then disassembled.|$|E
