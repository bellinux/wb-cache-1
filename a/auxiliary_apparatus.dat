40|$|In {{ultrasonic}} wave transmission test, the measurement conditions {{concerned with the}} thickness of the particleboard, such as the dimensions and setup of the test specimen, the mounted position of the sensors and the fixing pressure of the sensors, had a significant influence on the measurement of the ultrasonic velocity and the maximum amplitude of transmitted {{ultrasonic wave}}. These parameters were examined in this paper. No significant influence on the velocity measurements was found within the range of the acousto-ultrasonic measurement. However, the dimensions and setup of test specimen influenced the maximum amplitude, which involves the attenuation of the ultrasonic wave. It is suggested that the dimensions and setup of test specimen must be unified on the measurement of maximum amplitude using acousto-ultrasonic technique. The results indicated that the maximum amplitude was also influenced significantly by deviations in the horizontal direction of both sensors and the fixing pressure of the sensors to the surface of specimen.

Two different kinds of aluminum sheet metal, each with four thicknesses were used in the experiments. The mechani­cal properties of the various sheets were evaluated with particular attention being paid to the mechanical anisotropy so that this could be related to the failure during the punching operation. A new high pressure retainer was designed and built for pressurization of the viscoelastic press pads. This along with existing equipment and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>apparatus</b> for the detection of secondary fracture was used to study the primary and secondary fractures. As a result of the analysis of the primary and secondary fractures a useful prediction equation was developed. The prediction equation, with limitations, can be used to esti­mate the pressure necessary to cause complete fracture when punching holes in the aluminum sheet metals. The secondary, fracture analysis yielded contour-type plots from which the suitability of certain combinations of the process variables can be determined. These plots show that for certain combina­tions complete fracture cannot be obtained with practical pressure ratios and with other combinations an optimum punch­ing condition can be established.

It was unable to demonstrate “size dimorphism between the sexes” which was suggested by Cort from his studies on an eye-spotted non-mammalian schistosome, in spite of most careful measurements {{of a large number}} of cercariae from many infested snails. 2. Beneath the circular and longitudinal musle layers is found a layer of diagonal muscle in the anterior half of the bodywall. 3. There are certain numbers of sensory organ (a process with a delicate hair) on the surface of the body and tail. 4. There are four retractor muscle bands in the anterior tip of the body. 5. A pair of granular cell groups which lie in the posterior region of the body of young cercaria remove into anterior body region (anterior organ) at all once at the time the cercaria is almost developed, and from characteristic sacs-a sort of syncytium. These sacs are namely “head gland” (of Narabayashi). But they have no function of secretion at all; it seems highly probable that they function mechanically to assist the penetration of the cercaria into the final host as a <b>auxiliary</b> <b>apparatus</b> of pushing out of the fore part of the anterior body region in cooperation with the boundary muscle. By above-mentioned views I wish to propose the name “head sac” instead of “head gland”. 6. Three pairs of retractor muscle bands radiate from the proximal region of the ventral sucker to the dorsal side of the body, where they are inserted. 7. From each ganglion two nerve stems run dorsally and ventrally, and each of them directly bifurcates into anterior and posterior nerve strands, which run respectively to the both ends of the body. 8. Two distinct type of movements, peristalsis and rythmic segmentation, are observed on the oesophagus. 9. Two special flame cells are recognized instead of the cilia which described by Cort as “ciliated area”, in the beginning part of each main collecting tube. 10. The ducts of poison glands (penetration gland) are fixed in x-shape by three pairs of muscle bands on the level of the ganglion. 11. Each opening of the poison glands has hair bush, which act probably as a closing apparatus. 12.

Five pairs of head spines (anterior spine) are found on the anterior tip of the body: three of them on the dorsal side and two (much smaller than the former) of them on the ventral side. Opposite to the Faust's description, each of head spines is not hollow in the center and does not cap the opening of the poison gland. 14.

40|$|Politically the Colorado {{river is}} an interstate {{as well as}} an {{international}} stream. Physically the basin divides itself distinctly into three sections. The upper section from head waters to the mouth of San Juan comprises about 40 percent of the total of the basin and affords about 87 percent of the total runoff, or an average of about 15 000 000 acre feet per annum. High mountains and cold weather are found in this section. The middle section from the mouth of San Juan to the mouth of the Williams comprises about 35 percent of the total area of the basin and supplies about 7 percent of the annual runoff. Narrow canyons and mild weather prevail in this section. The lower third of the basin is composed of mainly hot arid plains of low altitude. It comprises some 25 percent of the total area of the basin and furnishes about 6 percent of the average annual runoff. The proposed Diamond Creek reservoir is located in the middle section and is wholly within the boundary of Arizona. The site is at the mouth of Diamond Creek and is only 16 m. from Beach Spring, a station on the Santa Fe railroad. It is solely a power project with a limited storage capacity. The dam which creats the reservoir is of the gravity type to be constructed across the river. The walls and foundation are of granite. For a dam of 290 feet in height, the back water will be about 25 m. up the river. The power house will be placed right below the dam perpendicular to the axis of the river. It is entirely a concrete structure. The power installation would consist of eighteen 37 500 H. P. vertical, variable head turbines, directly connected to 28 000 kwa. 110 000 v. 3 phase, 60 cycle generators with necessary switching and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Each unit is to be fed by a separate penstock wholly embedded into the masonry. Concerning the power market, the main electric transmission lines would extend to Prescott, Phoenix, Mesa, Florence etc. The mining regions of the mountains of Arizona would be the most adequate market. The demand of power in the above named places might not be large at present. It will, from the observation of the writer, rapidly increase with the wonderful advancement of all kinds of industrial development. All these things being comparatively feasible, there is one difficult problem: that is the silt. At the Diamond Creek dam site the average annual silt discharge is about 82 650 acre feet. The geographical conditions, however, will not permit silt deposites right in the reservoir. So this design will be made under the assumption given in Section 4. The silt condition and the change of lower course of the Colorado are much like those of the Yellow River in China. But one thing is different. On the Colorado most of the canyon walls are of granite, while those on the Yellow are of alluvial loess: so it is very hard, if not impossible, to get a favorable dam site on the lower part. As a visitor to this country, I should like to see the full development of the Colorado: but how about THE YELLOW!...|$|E
40|$|This thesis deals {{mainly with}} soraa {{investigations}} on the helium II film in motion. Some experiments are also {{described on the}} flow of liquid helium II through a capillary packed with jewellers rouge. A summary, chapter by chapter, {{of the contents of}} the thesis follows. Chapter 1. This contains a brief survey of the state of our experimental knowledge about the helium II film when these investigations were started. The various theories of the film that have been proposed, are very briefly reviewed, with particular regard to their physical interpretation. This survey is relevant {{to an understanding of the}} experiments that are described in the succeeding chapters of the thesis. A brief description of the oryostat and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>apparatus</b> that were used in these experiments is given. Chapter 2. The isothermal transfer of the helium II film at sub- critical ratas has been studied. The study of such transfer is of importance, for it can give information About frictional forces which may arise during the motion of the film. Sub-critical rates are produced in a manner analogous to that by which the current in a superconductor is kept below its critical value by means of a limiting series resistance, A detailed analysis of the results shows that neither the hypothesis of vanishing viscosity for Helium II, nor the mechanism of siphon flow, can account for these sub-critical rates. The concept of the aero-point diffusion of the superfluid, suggested by Mendelssohn, is shown to provide a satisfactory explanation of the results. Chapter 3. An investigation of the transfer of the helium II film at sub-critical rates, produced by the thermomechanical effect, is described. This method is more versatile than the one described in chapter 2, for a wide range of sub-critical rates can be produced vary much more simply. The apparatus consists essentially of a small glass dewar with a well-fitting lid, so that the inside of the dewar is thermally well isolated from the outside world. Flow of liquid helium II into the dewar through the film is produced by supplying heat electrically to the inside. The variation of the rate of flow with the heating rate, for different temperatures, has been studied. Some interesting results on the properties of the film follow: The flow in the film is friotionless for a wide range of sub-critioal velocities. This provides an independent and more complete oorroboratiun of the conclusions obtained In chapter 2. It is pointed out that, for these sub-critical rates in the film, the Gorter-Mellink theory of mutual friction is inapplicable. On the other hand, it seems clear that a mechanism allowing a sharp onset of the critical rate, below which the flow is frictionless, is necessary. Such a mechanism is provided by all those theories of film transfer which ultimately appeal to the principle of indeterminacy for determining the minimum excitation energy of the moving liquid. The heat of transport, Q, of the helium II film has been determined as a function of the temperature. The difference between this quantity, and H, the heat content (or enthalpy) of the bulk liquid, is pointed out. This distinction has caused some confusion in the past. It is shown that the entropy carried by the loving film is vanishingly small (the Tisza-London hypothesis), by calculating the entropy S of the bulk liquid from the relation Q = TS, and comparing it with that obtained from specific heat measurements. The heat of transport Q has been determined in the present experiments directly; it is, in essence, an isothermal, isobario determination for the film. The experiments of Kapitza on the fountain effect also give values of Q, for bulk flow in narrow channels, deduced from H. London's equation. There is close agreement between the Q's obtained by the two methods, thus supporting the interpretation, on the two-fluid model, of these phenomena. Chapter 4 Some observations are reported, which establish the conditions under which bulk liquid can "be formed from the helium II film during isothermal transfer. It had been thought previously that bulk liquid could be so formed, at any point below the highest meniscus, in a given arrangement for film transfer. The present experiments show that this is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition. The film will only form bulk liquid if it has to flow at a super-critical rate in order to remain as the film. In other words, bulk liquid is formed if the film encounters a perimeter, smaller than the limiting perimeter above the highest manisous. These considerations do not apply to the lowest point on the surface for film transfer, where bulk liquid can always be formed from the film. The experiments provide an indirect confirmation of the uniqueness of the critical rate of film transfer. Chapter 5 The transfer rates of the helium II film on a variety of surfaces have been studied, and the following results obtained: Experiments with specially polished stainless steel beakers show that the anomalous transfer rates previously observed on metal surfaces are to be associated with capillary flow in surface cracks and irregularities. If such a surface could be given a finish comparable to that of glass, the transfer rate would be the same as that on glass. A study of the transfer rates on perspex and lucite in dependence on their surface finish corroborates the hypothesis of capillary flow; it is suggested that this may also be responsible for the maximum in the curve of transfer rate versus temperature, observed in some cases. Surface flow of liquid helium just above the &gamme;-point, simulating genuine film transfer, was predicted, and actually observed in a carefully shielded 'rough' perspex beaker. This provides further evidence for the hypothesis of capillary flow. Experiments are described, which show that the increase in the transfer rates observed when the higher meniscus is near the rim of the be beaker, cannot be due to an increased thickness of the film at the rim. An alternative explanation is offered, that it is a manifestation of capillary flow, possibly coupled with the effect of a random distribution of the (microscopic) available perimeters for film transfer. The transfer rates on glass have been measured under large gravitational pressure differences, up to 15 cms. of liquid helium. It appears likely that the increased potential difference has no influence on the transfer rate, the observed increase of which can be attributed to the surface structure of the beakers used. All these experiments point indubitably to a uniquely defined critical rate of transfer of the Helium II film, independent of the nature of the substrate. Thus a complete theory of the critical rate should come out of the quantum mechanics of the helium film alone, independently of the nature of the forces between the atoms in the substrate and the helium atoms. This last factor would of course influence the thickness of the film. It thus appears that the theories of the critical rate based on considerations of zero-point energy are in the right direction. Chapter 6. The flow of helium II through a capillary tightly packed with jewellers rouge has been studied, under thermal and gravitational potential gradients. The pressure at an intermediate point in the channel is measured by the method previously used by Bowers and Mendelssohn in their experiments with smooth narrow channels. It appears that superflow in such tortuous channels is of a turbulent nature under isothermal conditions. The possibility of turbulence in superflow, thus established, has an important bearing on the interpretation of a large number of experiments on the flow in capillaries, and on experiments with oscillating discs. The thermal flow measurements show a curious inconsistency with those on gravitational flow. For a wide range of velocities, thermal flow is frictionless, while gravitational flow is dissipative; this is deduced from the behiviour of the pressure at the intermediate point in the channal. Furthermore, thermal flow shows a more or less sharp critical rate, while gravitational flow does not do so. These observations indicate that the concept of 'pressure at a point' in a superflow channel may not have the same meaning as in classical flow; it is not simply dependent on the pressures at the two ends, but requires one or more other parameters to determine it. </p...|$|E
