5|$|Shortly after 20:00, the {{trailing}} Swiftsure and Alexander, joined by Leander, attacked the French centre, causing severe damage to Franklin and killing Admiral Brueys on his quarterdeck with a cannon shot. At 21:00, a {{fire broke out}} in Orients stern, the blaze spread further by volleys from Swiftsure that also defeated efforts to extinguish it. The flames spread rapidly, racing up the masts and across the decks until the entire flagship was <b>a</b> <b>blazing</b> wreck. At 22:00, the vast magazines detonated, tearing the ship apart and hurling burning wreckage onto the neighbouring vessels. For ten minutes not a shot was fired, as the nearest ships battled to extinguish fires and the further ones paused in shock. The first ship to recommence hostilities was Franklin, but Admiral Blanquet's heavily outnumbered flagship was forced to surrender by 24:00. Tonnant, the only French ship still engaged, fought on against Majestic until 03:00, when the mortally wounded Captain Aristide Aubert Du Petit Thouars succeeded in dragging his ship to the temporary safety of the rear division under Rear-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve.|$|E

25|$|According to Weinfeld, the Abraham {{covenant}} {{represents a}} covenant of grant, which binds the suzerain. It is {{the obligation of}} the master to his servant and involves gifts given to individuals who were loyal serving their masters. In the covenant with Abraham in Genesis 15, it is God who is the suzerain who commits himself and swears to keep the promise. In the covenant there are procedures of taking the oath, which involve a smoking oven and <b>a</b> <b>blazing</b> torch. There are many similarities between Genesis 15 and the Abba-El deed. Genesis 15 and similarly in the Abba-El deed it is the superior party who places himself under oath. Also the oaths in both involve {{a situation where the}} inferior party is delivering the animals while the superior swears the oath. The Abraham covenant is part of a tradition of covenantal sacrifices, which dates back to the third millennium BC. The animals that are slaughtered in the covenant in Genesis 15 are considered a sacrificial offering. The covenant in Genesis 15 preserve the sacrificial element alongside the symbolic act.|$|E
