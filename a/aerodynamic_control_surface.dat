40|$|This paper {{contains}} a simulation {{study of a}} real-time adaptive least-squares drag minimization algorithm for an aeroelastic model of a flexible wing aircraft. The aircraft model {{is based on the}} NASA Generic Transport Model (GTM). The wing structures incorporate a novel <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> known as the Variable Camber Continuous Trailing Edge Flap (VCCTEF). The drag minimization algorithm uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the optimal VCCTEF deflections for minimum drag {{in the context of an}} altitude-hold flight control mode at cruise conditions. The aerodynamic coefficient parameters used in this optimization method are identified in real-time using Recursive Least Squares (RLS). The results demonstrate the potential of the VCCTEF to improve aerodynamic efficiency for drag minimization for transport aircraft...|$|E

The applied materials are mainly Oxide Dispersion Strengthened (ODS) alloys produced by powder metallurgy. The main design problems for metallic hot structures are discussed and a description is presented of the production processes that are developed. High temperature vacuum brazing is applied {{for the production of}} stiffened skin panels that are virtually insensitive to thermal stress. A new procedure for the production of beaded shear webs has been developed using explosive forming at room temperature. Other joining methods are investigated as well and the first tests with explosive welding of PM 1000 are promising. The shape of beaded shear webs has been selected and three test models have been produced and thermally tested. © 2002 by the author(s).

The comprehensive experimental program was conducted using test facilities at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and Ames Research Center. A post-test examination of some of the experimental results obtained from NASA-MSFC's 14 x 14 -inch trisonic wind tunnel is presented.

40|$|Short Takeoff Vertical Landing (STOVL) {{aircraft}} {{rely on the}} {{propulsion system}} for the lift and control functions during slow speed flight. The propulsion system provides the entire lifting force {{and all of the}} control power for hovering flight at zero airspeed. STOVL designs such as the General Dynamics E- 7 D ejector configuration incorporate an integrated flight/propulsion control system to manage the aerodynamic and propulsive-lift control effectors and to reduce the pilot's workload for powered-lift flight. Desired flying qualities characteristics are implemented through the utilization of an explicit model following flight control system. With the model following control system, the pilot commands the desired response (e. g., throttle commands vertical velocity in hover, instead of power lever angle). Design considerations for developing a multivariable model-following flight control system are presented in this paper. When the regulator gains are defined in terms of generalized controls, the design problem becomes how to best transform the generalized controls to <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface,</b> thrust and thrust vectoring commands...|$|E
40|$|As the SSA system {{upgrades}} {{its existing}} capabilities and adds new ones, the potential offered by inexpensive CubeSat-based systems is growing more attractive. The {{potential benefits of}} using CubeSats increase if they are operated in groups to form ‗virtual ‘ satellites, which have the same functionality {{of a much larger}} satellite, but {{at a fraction of the}} cost. This paper will investigate the feasibility of using differential aerodynamic forces to control a formation of CubeSats in order to form a virtual satellite. Unfortunately, due to third body gravitational forces, solar radiation pressure, and other perturbing forces, the satellites will drift apart if no control mechanism is employed to maintain the formation. However, providing for a control mechanism is difficult. Using a rocket engine is expensive, increases mission risk, and requires fuel to be carried in the rather limited volume available in a typical CubeSat. However, passive techniques that take advantage of the differential aerodynamic forces experienced by two spacecraft can be used to exert a modest amount of control over the formation. Techniques for doing this have been discussed in the literature. These techniques rely on a simple drag plate, and only allow modest control of the formation in the plane defined by the spacecrafts orbit. An alternative is to treat the drag plate as an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface,</b> much as is done with an aircraft. This technique allows the control surface to be oriented in a fully 3 dimensional fashion, allowing a greater range of control of the satellite formation. A challenge in treating the dra...|$|E
40|$|The {{closed-loop}} dynamic {{behavior of}} post-buckled precompressed (PBP) piezoelectric elements is in-vestigated in this paper. PBP actuators {{have been shown}} to be capable of generating significantly larger deflections than traditional piezoelectric actuators, up to a factor of three, without compromising applied end force. Due to an axial force close to the perfect-column buckling load they have displayed reduced stability and even instability around zero deflection. Therefore, a closed-loop control system was created to stabilize the PBP actuator over its entire range of deflections. The dynamic response of this system was compared with the open-loop response of the PBP actuator and with the dynamic characteristics of a traditional elec-tromechanical servoactuator. It was found that a pure integrative (I) controller was able to stabilize the PBP actuator over its entire range of deflections. To maintain stability, the gains had to be decreased for higher axial loads, reducing the bandwidth of the system, but still outperforming a traditional servoactuator by 40 %. Furthermore, the influence of actuating an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> was investigated by adding an inertial mass to one of the supporting axes of the PBP actuator. It was shown that a PBP actuator was capable of rotating these masses, although this slightly reduced the speed of the response.

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{computational model}} of a generic hypersonic vehicle was developed {{for the purpose of}} determining the vehicle's performance characteristics, which include the lift, drag, thrust, and moment acting on the vehicle at specified altitude, flight condition, and vehicular configuration. The lift, drag, thrust, and moment are developed for the body fixed coordinate system. These forces and moments arise from both aerodynamic and propulsive sources. SCRAMjet engine performance characteristics, such as fuel flow rate, can also be determined. The vehicle is assumed to be a lifting body with a single <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface.</b> The body shape and control surface location are arbitrary and must be defined. The aerodynamics are calculated using either 2 -dimensional Newtonian or modified Newtonian theory and approximate high-Mach-number Prandtl-Meyer expansion theory. Skin-friction drag was also accounted for. The skin-friction drag coefficient {{is a function of the}} freestream Mach number. The data for the skin-friction drag coefficient values were taken from NASA Technical Memorandum 102610. The modeling of the vehicle's SCRAMjet engine is based on quasi 1 -dimensional gas dynamics for the engine diffuser, nozzle, and the combustor with heat addition. The engine has three variable inputs for control: the engine inlet diffuser area ratio, the total temperature rise through the combustor due to combustion of the fuel, and the engine internal expansion nozzle area ratio. The pressure distribution over the vehicle's lower aft body surface, which acts as an external nozzle, is calculated using a combination of quasi 1 -dimensional gas dynamic theory and Newtonian or modified Newtonian theory. The exhaust plume shape is determined by matching the pressure inside the plume, calculated from the gas dynamic equations, with the freestream pressure, calculated from Newtonian or Modified Newtonian theory. In this manner, the pressure distribution along the vehicle after body expansion surface is then determined. The aerodynamic modeling, the engine modeling, and the exhaust plume analysis are described in more detail. A description of the computer code used to perform the above calculations is given and an input/output example is then given. The computer code is available on a Macintosh floppy disk...|$|E

Thirdly, a hybrid model predictive control (MPC) method is employed to design autopilot. Finally, simulation results under different conditions are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which demonstrate that <b>control</b> allocation between <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> and lateral jets is realized by adjusting the weighting matrix in an index function...|$|R
