40|$|An <b>Assaying</b> <b>Balance</b> {{from the}} First Halfof the 19 th Century at the University ofTartu History MuseumThe University of Tartu History Museum’s {{collection}} of older analytical balances also includes an <b>assaying</b> <b>balance</b> probably {{from the first}} half of the 19 th century. The balance belonged to the Tartu State University department of inorganic chemistry and was handed over to the historymuseum in 1982, where it was first displayed in the same year during the exhibition of science history commemorating the 350 th anniversary of the University of Tartu. According to the lore of the department the <b>assaying</b> <b>balance</b> had once belonged to Carl Ernst Heinrich Schmidt (1822 – 1894), who was once a chemistry professor at the University ofTartu and had worked for the University in 1847 – 1892. The balance is placed inside a birch wood box finished with red lacquer and with the measurements of 14. 0 x 24. 5 x 2. 7 cm. The balance is complete and in working order. Six of the lighter weights are missing from the set of milligram weights that should consist of 16 pieces by regulation. The largest weight is 1, 000 milligrams, the smallest was 0. 1 mg. Two small separate and gilded balance pans have alsosurvived. The balance is assembled on top of the box of the balance. The balance beam is 17. 8 cm long, the pointer of the balance is 8. 0 cm long. The steel knife-edge bearing of the balance beam is supported by the steel bearing seat. The pointer of the balance faces upward and reaches the dioptric needle. The back of the vane is covered with milk glass. The balance beam is made of brass, the pointer of steel. The diameter of the balance pans is 3. 3 cm and depth 0. 3 cm. The balance pans are suspended from three silk threads. The length of the silk thread from the balancepan to the fastening hook is 11. 0 cm. The balance is suspended from a lifting mechanism that enables to lift the balance up for the time of weighing. The  balance may be lifted and lowered with the aid of a string; one end of it is attached to the coil fastened to the top of the balance box from whence the string runs through two sheaves, whilethe other end is fastened to the lifting mechanism holding the balance. The balance is equipped with a damper that reduces vibration. The balance has been measured in detail so that it would be possible to compare it with other similar balances elsewhere. The forerunner of this balance type is W. F. Lingke, master at the Freiberg Mining Institute’s portable <b>assaying</b> <b>balance</b> made in 1827 (Harkort’s scale). The balance belongs to Harkort’s blowpipe kit along with other items necessary for analyses. A balance made somewhat later by the same master which is nearly identical but equipped with abalance damper is called Plattner’s scale and it is placed in a separate balance box. Both balances have a pointer and a vane with a needle facing upwards. The description and drawing of a scale with a balance damper were published in the first volume of K. F. Plattner’s monograph published in 1835 (Die Probierkunst mit dem Lötrohre). The third andcomplemented issue of Plattner’s monograph (1853) includes a drawing of a balance made by the same master, which shows that a significant change has been made to the construction of the balance: the scale pointer and vane with the needle are facing downwards. Balances made later by the same company (see Burchard, The History and Apparatusof Blowpipe Analysis) have downward-facing scale pointer and the needle of the vane is replaced with a scale with divisions. Proceeding from the changes in the construction of balances we may presume that our <b>assaying</b> <b>balance,</b> the pointer of which faces upwards and which has a vane, could have been made before 1853. The dimensions of our balance and Plattner’s scale practically coincide. This article provides an overview of the developmental history of <b>assaying</b> <b>balances,</b> using a selection of contemporary overviews on that subject as well as available and more important original sources pertaining to <b>assaying</b> <b>balances</b> for that purpose. The drawings, descriptions and other information on scales are based on Georgius Agricola’s De re metallica libri XII (seventh volume of the 1974 German publication); Lazarus Ercker’s Der grosse Probierbuch von 1580 and Johann Andrea Cramer’s Anfangsgründe der Probierkunst published in 1746 and 1794. The article also offers a brief discussion on the golden laboratory, Das Goldhaus, of August the Kurfürstof Saxony in his castle in Dresden, as well as the ruler’s activities in the field of alchemy, assaying, coinage; and a summary of the manuscript Churfürst Augusti Kunstbuch at the University of Tartu Library...|$|R

Adherent EPCs, that expressed the endothelial marker proteins (PCAM- 1, CD 105, CD 133, and VEGFR 2) revealed by flow cytometry were treated with three HDAC inhibitors: Butyrate (BuA), Trichostatin A (TSA), and Valproic acid (VPA). RT-PCR assay showed that HDAC inhibitors down-regulated the expression of endothelial genes such as VE-cadherin, CD 133, CXCR 4 and Tie- 2. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis illustrated that HDAC inhibitors selectively reduce the expression of VEGFR 2, CD 117, VE-cadherin, and ICAM- 1, whereas the expression of CD 34 and CD 45 remained unchanged, demonstrating that HDAC is involved in endothelial differentiation of progenitor cells. Real-Time PCR demonstrated that TSA down-regulated telomerase activity probably via suppression of hTERT expression, suggesting that HDAC inhibitor decreased cell proliferation.

STUDY DESIGN A novel <b>assay</b> of prooxidant-antioxidant <b>balance</b> (PAB) was applied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of selenium supplementation in pregnancy. We measured the prooxidant burden and the antioxidant capacity simultaneously in one assay, thereby calculating a redox index. A total of 166 primigravid pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy, were randomized to receive 100 microg of selenium (n= 83) or placebo (n= 83) per day until delivery. PAB values and serum selenium concentrations were measured at baseline {{and at the end}} of study. RESULTS Pretreatment demographic data and biochemical indices including serum selenium concentrations did not differ significantly between the groups. The drop-out rates for the groups were 22 / 83 and 19 / 83 for the selenium and placebo groups, respectively. Supplementation with selenium was associated with a significant increase in mean serum selenium concentration (P< 0. 001) but without significant change in mean PAB value.

40|$|Background: Gliomas are {{the most}} common primary brain tumors of the central nervous system. Among a number of {{different}} bio-molecular events, molecular connections between oxidative stress pathways and their development is prevalent. Oxidative stress is the consequence of an imbalance between pro-oxidant factors and antioxidant defense. This imbalance may lead to DNA damage and changes in growth and function of cells in the brain. Many evidences show that reactive oxygen species in the mammalian brain are directly responsible for cell and tissue function and dysfunction. A brain tumor is correlated with oxidative stress. In this study, we determine the pro-oxidant – antioxidant balance in patients with grade IV brain tumors (glioblastoma multiforme) by the pro-oxidant – antioxidant assay. Methods: We collected sera from 50 patients with high grade (IV) glioblastoma multiform and 49 healthy subjects. The pro-oxidant - antioxidant assay was measured. Results: There was a significant increase in pro-oxidant - antioxidant values in patients (158. 10 ± 85. 71 HK unit) compared to the control group (74. 54 ± 33. 54 HK; P= 0. 001.

It also determines the impact both on kidney function tests. Methods: Ninety subjects with Î²-thalassemia major (Î²TM) and 90 more healthy subjects as the control group were enrolled in the study. Laboratory parameters, serum hs-CRP, and the novel <b>assay</b> of prooxidant-antioxidant <b>balance</b> were measured.

Here we report a Portuguese woman who suffered in her sixties from a chronic hemolytic anemia due to G 6 PD deficiency. Molecular studies revealed heterozygosity for an in-frame 18 -bp deletion, mapping to exon 10 leading to a deletion of 6 residues, 362 - 367 (LNERKA), which is a novel G 6 PD class 1 variant, G 6 PD Tondela.

40|$|Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is {{distinguished}} from {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 (HSV- 1) {{by the fact that}} cell-to-cell fusion and syncytium formation require only gH and gL within a transient-expression system. In the HSV system, four glycoproteins, namely, gH, gL, gB, and gD, are required to induce a similar fusogenic event. VZV lacks a gD homologous protein. In this report, the role of VZV gB as a fusogen was investigated and compared to the gH-gL complex. First of all, the VZV gH-gL experiment was repeated under a different set of conditions; namely, gH and gL were cloned into the same vaccinia virus (VV) genome. Surprisingly, the new expression system demonstrated that a recombinant VV-gH+gL construct was even more fusogenic than seen in the prior experiment with two individual expression plasmids containing gH and gL (K. M. Duus and C. Grose, J. Virol. 70 : 8961 – 8971, 1996). Recombinant VV expressing VZV gB by itself, however, effected the formation of only small syncytia. When VZV gE and gB genes were cloned into one recombinant VV genome and another fusion assay was performed, extensive syncytium formation was observed. The degree of fusion with VZV gE-gB coexpression was comparable to that observed with VZV gH-gL: in both cases, > 80 % of the cells in a monolayer were fused. Thus, these studies established that VZV gE-gB coexpression greatly enhanced the fusogenic properties of gB. Control experiments documented that the fusion <b>assay</b> required a <b>balance</b> between the fusogenic potential of the VZV glycoproteins and the fusion-inhibitory effect of the VV infection itself...|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} limitations need to {{be addressed}} in connection with the presented manuscript. The study was conducted in terms of a monocentric project, including {{only a limited number of}} patients. In the surgical control group, only patients undergoing major abdominal surgery were enrolled. Moreover, those patients most frequently suffered from a tumorous disease. This might have influenced the results, since tumour cells are able to activate blood coagulation through multiple mechanisms [53]. Accordingly, D-dimers were shown to be increased in surgical patients prior to the surgical procedure in comparison with healthy controls. The viscoelastic tests used within the presented investigation might have been not sensitive enough to identify minor changes within the fibrinolytic homoeostasis, so that a tPA-activated thromboelastometrical assay would have been of value for the assessment of the magnitude of an ongoing fibrinolysis shutdown. Besides, this decreased ability to detect minor changes is not only restricted to the evaluation of the fibrinolytic system, since the great amount of activator used in the different thromboelastometrical <b>assays</b> shifts the <b>balance</b> towards an over-activation in general. Furthermore, most patients in the septic group revealed an underlying abdominal focus, so that it has to be questioned critically whether these results can be transferred to septic patients with other foci without any limitations. Moreover, it cannot be fully excluded that the low-dose UFH treatment regime in septic as well as surgical patients might have had an influence on the presented test results, even though UFH and enoxaparin calibrated anti-Xa activity as well as thrombin time showed no significant influence. Besides, since the study was designed for a maximal observation period of 30  days, conclusions regarding long-term outcome cannot be drawn.|$|R

40|$|Continuous and batch {{reactors}} {{were used}} to assess the effect of the exposure of casein-coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on Escherichia coli (E. coli). Additionally, E. coli membrane extracts, membrane permeability and Langmuir film <b>balance</b> <b>assays</b> {{were used to}} determine integrity and changes in lipid composition in response to AgNPs exposure. ^ Results showed that batch conditions were not appropriate for the tests due to the production of exopolymeric substances (EPS) during the growth phase. After 5 hours of contact between AgNPs and the used growth media containing EPS, the nanoparticles increased in size from 86 nm to 282 nm reducing the stability and thus limiting cell-nanoparticle interactions. AgNPs reduced E. coli growth by 20 % at 1 mg/L, in terms of Optical Density 670 (OD 670), while no effect was detected at 15 mg/L. At 50 mg/L of AgNPs was not possible to perform the test due to aggregation and sedimentation of the nanoparticles. Membrane extract assays showed that at 1 mg/L AgNPs had a greater change in area (- 4. 4 cm 2) on bacteria compared to 15 mg/L (- 4. 0 cm 2). This area increment suggested that membrane disruption caused by AgNPs had a stabilizing/rigidifying effect where the cells responded by shifting their lipid composition to more unsaturated lipids to counteract membrane rigidification. ^ In chemostats, the constant inflow of fresh media and aeration resulted in less AgNPs aggregation, thus increased the AgNPs-bacteria interactions, in comparison to batch conditions. AgNPs at 1 mg/L, 15 mg/L, and 50 mg/L inhibited the growth (OD 670 reduction) by 0 %, 11 % and 16. 3 %, respectively. Membrane extracts exposed to 1 mg/L, 15 mg/L, and 50 mg/L of AgNPs required greater changes in area by - 0. 5 cm 2, 2. 7 cm 2 and 3. 6 cm 2, respectively, indicating that the bacterial membranes were disrupted and bacteria responded by synthesizing lipids that stabilize or strengthen membranes. This study showed that the chemostat is more appropriate for the testing of nanotoxicological effects when testing bacteria at growing conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen and {{phosphorus}} from animal waste and agricultural by-products can profoundly impact water and soil quality. Diet formulation on a digestible amino acid basis reduces nitrogen excretion. Formulation on a digestible amino acid basis requires reliable estimates of amino acid digestibility. Apparent ileal digestibility of amino acids in corn, pearl millet, oat groats, sorghum, and soybean meal {{was measured in}} barrows using the difference method of diet formulation. The {{results indicate that the}} difference method of diet formulation represents a viable application for assessing amino acid digestibility of feedstuffs in pigs. True digestibility of amino acids in corn, soybean meal, and wheat by-products (bakery meal, red dog, wheat middlings) used in duck diet formulation was assessed. Cecectomized and intact ducks were subjected to precision feeding and collection methodologies to evaluate the influence of hindgut microflora on nutrient digestibility. The results suggest that variation in amino acid digestibility between cecectomized and intact ducks is considerable for low-protein ingredients, but differences in digestibility are less pronounced with higher amino acid intakes. Similar precision feeding and collection methodologies were employed to characterize the metabolizable energy (ME) of several cereal grains (corn, barley, pearl millet, sorghum, triticale). The study demonstrated the potential utility of pearl millet and sorghum in feed formulation for ducks based on comparable ME to corn. Some agricultural wastes are characterized by high nitrogen {{and phosphorus}} contents. Swine and duck nutrient <b>balance</b> <b>assays</b> were employed to evaluate co-products from a pork processing plant and a commercial microbial fermentation unit. The fermentation co-product was observed to have no feeding value due to poor ability to support nitrogen retention in pigs and ducks. Antinutritional compounds restrict the use of certain ingredients in diet formulation by exerting negative effects on nutrient availability. The effect of new xylanase and phytase preparations on performance of young pigs was investigated. Xylanase in a corn-soybean meal diet failed to influence pig performance, but improvements in growth and feed efficiency were effected by phytase addition to diets. In conclusion, incorporation of nutrient digestibility and exogenous enzyme research findings in commercial diet formulation will aid efforts to reduce the negative environmental impact of animal production. ...|$|R

40|$|Os efeitos dietéticos de lisina digestível e zinco quelato para frangos de corte machos entre 22 e 42 dias de idade foram avaliados em dois ensaios experimentais. Adotou-se o delineamento inteiramente casualizado em arranjo fatorial 5 × 2, com cinco níveis de lisina (0, 841; 0, 876; 0, 997; 1, 022 e 1, 030 %) e dois de zinco (43 e 243 ppm). No primeiro ensaio, utilizaram-se 900 aves com peso médio inicial de 957, 4 g distribuídas em parcelas experimentais de 30 aves e três repetições e, no segundo ensaio, 180 frangos com peso médio inicial de 866, 22 g, divididos em parcelas de três aves e seis repetições. As características avaliadas foram desempenho, rendimento de cortes e composição {{corporal}} (1 º ensaio), balanço de nitrogênio e digestibilidade aparente das dietas (2 º ensaio). Houve interação entre os níveis de lisina e zinco para o ganho de peso, a conversão alimentar, a matéria seca ingerida e o balanço energético. Os rendimentos de peito, coxa e sobrecoxa tiveram aumentos lineares em resposta ao acréscimo no nível de lisina digestível na dieta. O melhor desempenho foi obtido com o nível de 0, 997 % de lisina digestível (ou 1, 134 % lisina total) e de 43 ppm de zinco. Para maior rendimento dos cortes, o nível de lisina digestível recomendável deve ser no mínimo 1, 002 % (ou 1, 139 % de lisina total), independentemente dos níveis de zinco quelato. A maior inclusão de zinco em dietas para frangos de corte dos 22 aos 42 dias de idade não melhora a utilização da lisina na dieta e aumenta a deposição de gordura corporal. The dietary {{effects of}} digestible lysine and chelate zinc for male broiler chickens from 22 to 42 days of age were evaluated in two experimental assays. A complete randomized block experimental design in a 5 × 2 factorial, with five lysine levels (0. 841, 0. 876, 0. 997, 1. 022 and 1. 030 %) and {{two levels of}} zinc (43 and 243 ppm) was used. In the first assay, it was used 900 birds with initial average weight 957. 4 g distributed in experimental units with 30 birds and three replications {{and in the second}} assay, 180 broilers with initial average weight 866. 22 g split in plots with 3 birds and six replications were used. The characteristics evaluated were performance, cut yield and body composition (1 st <b>assay),</b> nitrogen <b>balance</b> and apparent digestibility of diets (2 nd assay). There was an interaction among levels of lysine and zinc for weight gain, feed conversion, ingested dry matter and energy balance. Yields of breast, thigh and drumstick had linear increases in response to increments in the level of digestible lysine in the diet. The best performance was obtained for level 0. 997 % of digestive lysine (or 1. 134 % total lysine) and level of 43 ppm zinc. For higher cut yields, the recommended level of digestible lysine has to be at least 1. 002 % (or 1. 139 % total lysine), regardless to the levels of chelate zinc. Greater inclusion of zinc in diets for broiler from 22 to 42 days of age does not improve the utilization of dietary lysine and increases body fat deposition...|$|R

METHODS: Centesimal composition and amino acid analyses were performed on both proteinaceous materials for the calculation of an adequate amino acid profile based on the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization recommendation. The nutritive value indexes for the whey protein isolate, the collagen hydrolysate and mixtures of both proteins were determined in rats through growth <b>assay</b> and nitrogen <b>balance.</b> The experimental parameters from nutritional assays were submitted to analysis of variance and the Tukey test applied for differences among means (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: The whey protein isolate met all {{the requirements of the}} Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization reference for essential amino acids while the collagen hydrolysate showed deficiency in all essential amino acids and complete absence of tryptophan. The casein showed higher efficiency than the whey isolate and mixtures of both proteins in promoting growth in the rat. There was no statistical difference in growth between the whey protein isolate and the mixture of 60 % whey protein isolate and 40 % collagen hydrolysate. In all other indexes of protein nutritive value the mixture 60 % whey protein isolate and 40 % collagen hydrolysate revealed itself equal or superior to casein and the 100 % whey isolate. CONCLUSION: The protein mixture 60 % whey protein isolate and 40 % collagen hydrolysate showed high nutritive value and water solubility indexes, considered favorable properties as an ingredient for the formulation of dietetic products for elderly people...|$|R
