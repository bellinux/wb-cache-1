40|$|A {{language}} model (LM) is a probability distribution over all possible word sequences. It {{is a vital}} component of many natural language processing tasks, such as automatic speech recognition, statistical machine translation, information retrieval and so on. The art of {{language model}}ing {{has been dominated by}} a simple yet powerful model family, the n-gram language models. Many {{attempts have been made to}} go beyond n-grams either by proposing a new mathematical framework or by integrating more knowledge of human language, preferably both. The random forest language model (RFLM) — a collection of randomized decision tree language models — has distinguished itself as a successful effort of the former kind; we explore its potential of the latter. We start our quest by advancing our understanding of the RFLM through explorative experimentation. To facilitate further investigation, we address the problem of training the RFLM on large amount of data through an efficient disk swapping algorithm. We formalize our method of integrating various knowledge sources into language models with random forests and illustrate its applicability with three innovative applications: morphological LMs of Arabic, prosodic LMs for speech recognition <b>and</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntactic</b> <b>and</b> ii topic information in LMs...|$|R
40|$|Finding semantically related {{words is}} a first step in the {{direction}} of automatic ontology building. Guided by the view that similar words occur in similar contexts, we looked at the <b>syntactic</b> context <b>of</b> words to measure their semantic similarity. Words that occur in a direct object relation with the verb drink, for instance, have something in common (liquidity, [...] .). Co-occurrence data for common nouns and proper names, for several syntactic relations, was collected from an automatically parsed corpus of 78 million words of newspaper text. We used several vector-based methods to compute the distributional similarity between words. Using Dutch EuroWordNet as evaluation standard, we investigated which vector-based method <b>and</b> which <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntactic</b> relations is the strongest predictor of semantic similarity...|$|R
40|$|Bloggers, {{professional}} reviewers, {{and consumers}} continuously create opinion–rich web reviews about products and services, {{with the result}} that textual reviews are now abundant on the web and often convey a useful overall rating (number of stars). However, an overall rating cannot express the multiple or conflicting opinions that might be contained in the text, or explicitly rate the different aspects of the evaluated entity. This work addresses the task of automatically predicting ratings, for given aspects of a textual review, by assigning a numerical score to each evaluated aspect in the reviews. We handle this task as both a regression and a classification modeling problem <b>and</b> explore several <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntactic</b> <b>and</b> semantic features. Our results suggest that classification techniques perform better than ranking modeling when handling evaluative text. ...|$|R
40|$|Current {{advances}} in shallow parsing {{allow us to}} use results from this field in stylogenetic research, so that a new methodology for the automatic analysis of literary texts can be developed. The main pillars of this methodology- which is borrowed from topic detection research- are (i) using more complex features than the simple lexical features suggested by traditional approaches, (ii) using authors or groups of authors as a prediction class, and (iii) using clustering methods to indicate the differences and similarities between authors (i. e. stylogenetics). On {{the basis of the}} stylistic genome of authors, we try to cluster them into closely related and meaningful groups. We report on experiments with a literary corpus of five million words consisting of representative samples of female <b>and</b> male authors. <b>Combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntactic,</b> token-based <b>and</b> lexical features constitute a profile that characterizes the style of an author. The stylogenetics methodology opens up new perspectives for literary analysis, enabling and necessitating close cooperation between literary scholars and computational linguists. 1...|$|R

40|$|Background: One {{examined}} mainly {{structural and}} semantic features <b>of</b> <b>syntactic</b> idioms so far. The pragmatic dimension of these original units {{that are on}} the verge of syntax and phraseology, has not been highlighted properly in the scientific literature, so it needs theoretical understanding. The <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntactic</b> idiom <b>and</b> phraseological phenomenon refers to the communication techniques impacting on message recipient. Purpose: to analyze the intersection zones <b>of</b> <b>syntactic</b> idioms and precedent phenomena. Results: Analysis of the collected factual material allows to distinguish two areas <b>of</b> interpenetration <b>of</b> <b>syntactic</b> idioms and precedent units: 1) construction of expression according to the phraseologized model, within which the position of variable component is filled by the precedent name or precedent expression; 2) the model of sentence itself is precedent, and lexical content does not comply with generally known one that does not affect on understanding of model content by recipient. With a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntactic</b> idiom <b>and</b> precedent phenomena speakers provide drawing of recipients’ attention, carry out a hidden influence on them, express their own attitude to the realities, so that perform phatic, manipulative and expressive-evaluative functions. The modifications and transformations of precedent expressions and names appeared to be regular in such interpenetrations. Discussion: The obtained results reflect the general trend towards transform (transformation, modification, variation, etc.) of precedent, as well as phraseological units, and can be used for the analysis of patterns of their formation and modifications. Further research phase implies tracing patterns <b>of</b> <b>syntactic</b> idioms <b>combination</b> with other means of expressive syntax...|$|R

In an optimality-theoretic account, it is possible to rank some phonological alignment constraints above syntactic alignme nt constraints in a w ay that correctly accounts for the data. Alternatives which see k to derive clitic placement through syntactic movement operations face insuperable problems with the range of positions in which these clitics appear. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a study of verb cluster interruptions; a {{phenomenon}} that shows great variation across languages. This variation will {{be shown to be}} fairly systematic, as it is the direct result of interactions of different components of human cognition; namely syntactic structure and processing. It will be argued that different types of elements that are allowed within verb clusters in different languages can be predicted from a Verb Cluster Interruption Hierarchy, which follows directly from a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntactic</b> <b>and</b> processing principles...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} {{supervised}} learning approaches to {{word sense disambiguation}} is largely dependent on the features used to represent {{the context in which}} an ambiguous word occurs. Previous work has reached mixed conclusions; some suggest that <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntactic</b> <b>and</b> lexical features will perform most effectively. However, others have shown that simple lexical features perform well on their own. This paper evaluates the effect of using different lexical and syntactic features both individually <b>and</b> in <b>combination.</b> We show that it is possible for a very simple ensemble that utilizes a single lexical feature and a sequence of part of speech features to result in disambiguation accuracy that is near state of the art. ...|$|R

Extensive discussion of the linguistic evidence is complemented by a formal semantic treatment, set {{in the framework of}} Discourse Representation Theory. The analysis offers an explicit procedure to arrive at the aspectual meaning of a sentence from its syntactic surface structure.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the SpRL-CWW en-try into SemEval 2015 : Task 8 SpaceEval. It detects spatial and motion relations as de-fined by the ISO-Space specifications in two phases: (1) it detects spatial elements and spa-tial/motion signals with a Conditional Ran-dom Field model that uses a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> distributed word representations and lexico-syntactic features; (2) given relation candidate tuples, it simultaneously detects relation types and labels the spatial roles of participating ele-ments by using a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntactic</b> <b>and</b> semantic features in independent multi-class classification models for each relation type. In evaluation on the shared task data, our system performed particularly well on detection of el-ements and relations in unannotated data. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{utterance}} is {{a widely}} used linguistic unit. It seems, however, to escape every attempt to define it unequivocally. There {{seems to be a}} consensus in applied linguistics that a fuzzy <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntactic,</b> semantic <b>and</b> prosodic clues are necessary to identify the boundaries of an utterance. Drawing upon our own research in advanced French interlanguage, we present an analysis of the measure "Mean Length of Utterance" (MLU), widely used in studies on first language acquisition and speech disorders and, to a lesser extent, in second language acquisition. MLU is shown to be methodologically unreliable for adult speech. We argue that other measures of utterance length, like the MLU 3, are sounder and can help {{to gain a better understanding}} of synchronic variation in speech...|$|R
40|$|Bugs within {{programs}} typically arise within well-known motifs, such {{as complex}} language features or misunderstood programming interfaces. Some software development tools often detect {{some of these}} situations, and some integrated development environments suggest automated fixes {{for some of the}} simple cases. However, it is usually difficult to handcraft and integrate more complex bug-fixing into these environments. We present a language for specifying program transformations which is paired with a novel methodology for identifying and fixing bug patterns within Java source code. We propose a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> source code <b>and</b> bytecode analyses: this allows for using the control flow in the bytecode to help identify the bugs while generating corrected source code. The specification language uses a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntactic</b> rewrite rules <b>and</b> dataflow analysis generated from temporal logic based conditions. We demonstrate the approach with a prototype implementation. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{conceptual}} indexing and {{retrieval system}} at Sun Microsystems Laboratories (Woods et al., 2000) {{is designed to}} help people find specific answers to specific questions in unrestricted text. It uses a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntactic,</b> semantic, <b>and</b> morphological knowledge, together with taxonomic subsumption techniques, to address differences in terminology between a user's queries and the material that may answer them. At indexing time, the system builds a conceptual taxonomy of all the words and phrases in the indexed material. This taxonomy is based on the morphological structure <b>of</b> words, the <b>syntactic</b> structure <b>of</b> phrases, and semantic relations between meanings of words that it knows in its lexicon. At query time, the system automatically retrieves any concepts that are subsumed by (i. e., are more specific than) the user's query terms, according to this taxonomy. The system uses a penalty-based relaxation-ranking method to locate and rank potentially relevant passages i...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the expression of}} focus in Basque declarative sentences {{through the use of}} morphological, lexical and syntactic devices. It analyzes the different degrees of emphasis that can be provided by the <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> these three types of mechanisms, and the interaction ofthe expression of focus with the expression of the new/given information distinction. This study shows that constituents containing background information normally occur either before the focused element or after the verb, and that topics occur in sentence initial position. Elements whose information is non-contrastive and whose reference is already included in the verbal inflexion are normally deleted. The element with new information always occurs before the verb and receives the highest semantic prominence. The content of the focused element can also be emphasized by morphological means. This <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntactic</b> <b>and</b> morphological mechanisms, along with {{the fact that there are}} several places in which each sentence element can occur, allow for the occurrence of several degrees of emphatic prominence.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the model checking problem for symbolic-heap separation logic with user-defined inductive predicates, i. e., {{the problem of}} checking that a given stack-heap memory state satisfies a given formula in this language, as arises e. g. in software testing or runtime verification. First, we show {{that the problem is}} decidable; specifically, we present a bottom-up fixed point algorithm that decides the problem and runs in exponential time {{in the size of the}} problem instance. Second, we show that, while model checking for the full language is EXPTIME-complete, the problem becomes NP-complete or PTIME-solvable when we impose natural syntactic restrictions on the schemata defining the inductive predicates. We additionally present NP and PTIME algorithms for these restricted fragments. Finally, we report on the experimental performance of our procedures on a variety of specifications extracted from programs, exercising multiple <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>syntactic</b> restrictions...|$|R

40|$|UQ* is a {{software}} development environment that maintains documents described and represented in terms <b>of</b> their underlying <b>syntactic</b> structure.
