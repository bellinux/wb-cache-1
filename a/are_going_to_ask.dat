6000|$|The Astronomer said, quickly, [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> why {{creatures who}} have {{mastered}} space travel, and therefore atomic power, would want coal and oil. I can't answer that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't be a surprise; for I {{know you}} <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> some poor {{children}} here, {{and have a}} tree or something. It won't be like my dream; for they had ever so many trees, and more children than we can find anywhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think we'll go West next," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "Father {{wants to}} look up his mining interests, you know. We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him to take us along." [...] They did go west, and what adventures they had will be related in a new volume, entitled [...] "The Rover Boys Out West; or, The Search for a Lost Mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then look here," [...] Weiss said. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him <b>to</b> {{come into}} this office. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> treat this matter as an {{academic}} discussion, and I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him then what {{the result would be}} of such a step as you propose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry, Miss Morse," [...] the Inspector said quietly, [...] "to {{find you}} so unsympathetic. Had I found you {{differently}} disposed, I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> {{put yourself in}} my place. I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> look at these two tragedies {{from my point of}} view and from your own at the same time, and I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you whether any possible motive suggested itself to you, any possible person or cause, which might be benefited by the removal of these two men." ...|$|R
60|$|Ashe {{began to}} wonder whether {{everybody}} he met <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him this dangerous question.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> what I mean by {{posing as}} Miss Prim," [...] she said. [...] "I have {{never said that}} I was Miss Prim. You took the word of an ignorant little farmer's boy and I did not deny it when I found that you {{intended}} bringing me to Mr. Prim, for I wanted to see him. I {{wanted to ask him}} to help me. I have never met him, or his daughter either; but my father and Mr. Prim have been friends for many years.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, Fan, hear my last word, {{then take}} your own course. I quite {{understand}} your wheedling ways, and I have so often given {{way that you}} have come to {{think you can do}} just what you like with me. You have yet to learn that when my mind is once made up about anything you might just as well attempt to move the Monument as to move me. You shall not couple my name with yours; and if you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Captain Horton down here, I advise you, to prevent mistakes, to inform him that I distinctly refuse to join you in the invitation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, I will. Firstly, Arnold Baxter is in jail. Secondly, {{he states}} his friends <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the {{governor}} for a pardon. Thirdly, {{a friend in}} disguise comes to the jail with the supposed pardon. Fourthly, great joy of Baxter. Fifthly, he thanks his jailers and bids them good-by, as I said before. Sixthly, after he and his friend are gone the jailers inspect the so-called pardon. Seventhly, the jailers telephone to the governor. Eighthly, the pardon is pronounced a forgery, signatures, seal, and all. Ninthly, all {{the powers that be}} are as mad as hornets, but they can do nothing, for Baxter the elder has gone and has left no trace behind him." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{him some}} further {{questions}} concerning Ahab, {{when we heard}} a noise on deck.|$|R
60|$|FRANK [with his prettiest lyrical cadence] Precisely what I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> myself, {{in my own}} graceful fashion.|$|R
60|$|I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> a {{question}} here, {{but he did}} not give me a chance. He was very much moved.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{your advice}} and opinion. I {{do not know}} what to do. This acting scheme gets worse and worse, you see. They have chosen almost as bad a play as they could, and now, to {{complete}} the business, <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us. This is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first. I know no harm of Charles Maddox; but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable, the more than intimacy--the familiarity. I cannot think of it with any patience; and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as must, if possible, be prevented. Do not you see it in the same light?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Early in {{the winter}} the general had called at the Orangery. [...] "We {{are going to make}} a call upon the patriotism of the {{planters}} of this neighborhood, Mrs. Wingfield," [...] he said, during lunch time. [...] "You see our armies are facing those of the Federals opposite Washington, and can offer a firm front to any foe marching down from the North; but unfortunately they have command of the sea, and there is nothing to prevent their embarking an army on board ship and landing it in either the James or the York rivers, and in that case they might make a rush upon Richmond before there would be time to bring down troops to our aid. I am therefore proposing to erect a chain of works between the two rivers, so as {{to be able to keep}} even a large army at bay until re-enforcements arrive; but to do this a large number of hands will be required, and we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the proprietors of plantations to place as many negroes as they can spare at our disposal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{there was}} no arguing against that, was there? So here I am; and next week I expect Miss Mary that was, with her husband, who's a Parliament man, as she was {{engaged to be married}} to {{at the time of the}} upset, and my little ladies, who is getting quite big girls too. And if you hadn't been going away I'd ha' sailed round the castle tower, and I'd ha' pointed out the cottage to you. Yes, sir, I see what you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b> I found it lonely there; and I found the widow of a old mate of mine who seemed to think as how she could make me {{comfortable}}; and comfortable I am, sir--no words could say how comfortable I am; and do you know, sir, I'm blest if there aint a Joe up there at this identical time, only he's a very little one, and has got both arms. So you see, sir, I have got about as little right as has any chap in this mortial world to the name of Surly Joe." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Our {{discussion}} at luncheon was only postponed," [...] he reminded her. [...] "We have seen these documents. We {{know now that}} Mr. Weatherley had some reason to fear an interruption to his everyday life. Directly or indirectly, that interruption is connected with certain things of which you and I have spoken together. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you, therefore, <b>to</b> keep your promise. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> tell me everything that you know." ...|$|R

5000|$|On May 21, 2006, while {{promoting}} {{the release of}} the album Taking the Long Way, Maines recanted her 2003 apology to President Bush, saying, [...] "I don't feel that way anymore. I don't feel he is owed any respect whatsoever. ... If people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me to apologize based on who I am ... I don't {{know what to do about}} that.

50|$|During the hearing, Stempel's {{testimony}} {{fails to}} convince the committee. Both NBC network head Robert Kintner (Allan Rich) and Geritol executive Martin Rittenhome (Martin Scorsese) deny any knowledge of Twenty One being rigged. After being subpoenaed by Goodwin, Van Doren testifies before the committee and admits {{his role in the}} deception. After the hearing adjourns, he learns from reporters that he has been fired from Today and that Columbia's trustees <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for his resignation.|$|E
5000|$|When the {{contract}} with CBS ends 1993, no network {{is ever going to}} pay that much money again. The owners, who threw away all the television money, most on bad ballplayers, in the first 15 minutes after the checks cleared, <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the players for a giveback. And the players, who have every reason to believe the owners are rich idiots, are going to laugh at them. New York Times sports columnist George Vecsey in October 1991 ...|$|E
5000|$|During the convention, {{there was}} not much {{difference}} in policy between the candidates. Some delegates felt that Peterson was too young to be leader and others were dissuaded because he reminded them of current Tory Premier, Bill Davis. Smith presented a different style which provided a marked contrast from Peterson. He won on his 'intellectual qualities' and urban appeal. Smith presented himself as the party's chance for power. He said, [...] "the delegates <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> 'Could he run this province? He's got long hair, he's a shrink, he's Jewish, and he's from Quebec.' ... Well, you know, trying something different can be the highlight of a person's life." ...|$|E

5000|$|Colby {{also raised}} his own ethical {{concerns}} over the application of his work to real life situations. In 1984, he wrote, [...] With the great amount of attention now being paid by the media to artificial intelligence, it would be naive, shortsighted, and even self-deceptive {{to think that there}} will not be public interest in scrutinizing, monitoring, regulating, and even constraining our efforts. What we do can affect people’s lives as they understand them. People <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> not only what we are doing but also whether it should be done. Some might feel we are meddling in areas best left alone. We should be prepared to participate in open discussion and debate on such ethical issues." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{one of the}} top erotic actresses of her day, Hayashi {{was invited}} to the Cinequint theater in Shibuya to speak at a woman's-only night showing of pink films in March 2002. Similar events had {{attracted}} a large audience of young women. On the subject of women viewing her films, Hayashi told the weekly Shūkan Bunshun, [...] "To be honest, I've never really thought about whether my movies were being watched by men or women. We always presume that only guys are going to turn them on... Still, this'll be a great chance for girls to get to know about the porno movie industry. I think the most enjoyable part of the night {{is going to be the}} questions asked after the films are over. I wonder what the girls <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me?" ...|$|E
50|$|Brian {{describes}} that Daniel came to {{him later}} that day, expressing the hatred he feels towards his parents. He {{was kicked out of}} the house shortly after and sent back to foster care. Three months later, Daniel was caught while breaking into a house and ended up in a reform school. Although Maureen became very overprotective of him and her recently adopted son Chris, Brian found a way to secretly contact Daniel. Back in present life, Chris tells the police that the guy walking away from the home after the murder wasn't Daniel, but Brian. Criminal attorney, Ken Pierson, also discovered that according to the phone records from the last three months, a dozen calls were made to Daniel including the night of the murders. Investigators start to think that Brian and Daniel were both responsible for their parents' death. Kelley then meets Barbara, who took Brian to church, and tells him that Brian's birth mother abandoned Brian for days until the state took custody of him putting him into a foster care system like Daniel. Barbara then said that Daniel had five different families and Brian had six. When Kelley tells Brian that the police <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him a lot of questions, he finally reveals what really happened that night.|$|E
