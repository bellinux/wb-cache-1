5|$|On August 30, the British made a {{surprise}} breakout from the Boston Neck, {{set fire to}} a tavern, and withdrew to their defenses. On the same night, 300 Americans attacked Lighthouse Island and burned the lighthouse, killing several British soldiers and capturing 23 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of one life. On another August night, Washington sent 1,200 men to dig entrenchments on a hill near the Charlestown Neck. Despite a British bombardment, the Americans successfully dug the trenches.|$|E

She, however, was so shocked and dismayed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of her principal minister, that she gave Apokaukos's supporters, who were joined by the Gasmouloi, the fleet's marines, free rein to avenge their leader's death. As a result, all prisoners, some 200 in total, were massacred, even though some attempted to seek refuge in a nearby monastery.|$|E

5|$|Finally, Rico pins Panay to {{the exposed}} {{core of the}} U.S.-bound missile, and reprograms the {{targeting}} computer before jumping to safety. The missile changes course and explodes over Panau's oilfields, killing Panay and destroying the island's oil reserves. Rico rejoins Sheldon, Kane and Jade, who are dismayed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of billions of dollars' worth of oil. Rico explains that oil is not worth dying for; with its oil gone, interest in Panau will be lost, the superpowers will not war and the island's residents will be spared. Sheldon agrees, assuring Rico that a president friendly to the U.S. will be installed on Panau and the island will be closely monitored; the group raise their glasses, toasting friendship and a job well done.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{also used}} {{historical}} references {{for some of}} his names and Marc-Ange Draco's name is based upon that of El Draco, the Spanish nickname for Sir Francis Drake, a fact also used by J. K. Rowling for the naming of her character Draco Malfoy. For Tracy's background, Fleming used that of Muriel Wright, a married wartime lover of Fleming's, who died in an air-raid and Bond's grief {{for the loss of}} his wife is an echo of Fleming's <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of Wright. Fleming did make mistakes in the novel, however, such as Bond ordering a half-bottle of Pol Roger Champagne: Fleming's friend Patrick Leigh Fermor pointed out that Pol Roger was the only champagne at the time not to be produced in half-bottles.|$|E
5|$|He was accepted, and {{although}} his appointment delighted Murray, {{the government was}} very concerned <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of a good Attorney General. In an attempt {{to persuade him to}} stay, the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Newcastle offered him the Duchy of Lancaster, in addition to the position of Attorney General, an extra £6,000 a year, and a pension, and finally attempted to blackmail him by saying that if he accepted the office of Lord Chief Justice, the government would refuse to grant him a peerage. It was customary for all Lord Chief Justices to be given a peerage, and Murray responded by saying that in that situation he would refuse to become either Lord Chief Justice or Attorney General. Newcastle gave in, and promised to allow him to become Lord Chief Justice and to recommend him for a peerage.|$|E

5|$|MacLachlan's stay was unhappy. On 19 April 1943 he {{received}} news {{that his brother}} Gordon MacLachlan had been shot down over Brest, France while escorting B-24 bombers. They were intercepted by Focke-Wulf Fw 190s belonging to 1./Jagdgeschwader 2. Unteroffizier Erich Henning and Hauptmann Jürgen Heppe each claimed a Spitfire. 616 Squadron lost Gordon and Squadron leader Pip Lefevre. Lefevre survived and evaded capture, returning to Britain via Gibraltar. Gordon was killed and the Germans recovered the body and buried him at Plouguerneau. MacLachlan was bitter <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of his brother and was keen {{to get back into}} action against the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Whatever his upbringing, Bregowine was consecrated as {{archbishop}} on 27September761. His election {{took place}} in a brief period when Kent was free of Mercian dominance between 756 and 764, so the story that he owed his election to Æthelbert does fit with the time frame. He wrote letters to Archbishop Lul of Mainz which still exist, and which discuss an earlier meeting between the two men. Other activities as archbishop are recorded in surviving charters. One records that he protested <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of a church at Cookham that was confiscated by King Cynewulf of Wessex sometime after 760. Another surviving charter from Dunwald, a thegn of King Æthelbert, concerning land in Canterbury, records that Bregowine consented to the gift of land. Unfortunately, many of the early charters of the diocese of Canterbury are lost, which restricts knowledge of Bregowine's activities as archbishop.|$|E

When Underwood recovers and finds that Meechum's hand tracing has been painted over, he expresses grief and regret <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> to Claire, who says that Meechum was one of the few people who truly understood them.|$|E

Fatboy is unable to go through with it and walks out of the performance, so Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) takes over. At a New Year's Eve party, Fatboy kisses Mercy to put Kim off flirting with him.|$|E
5|$|The 38th (Welsh) Division (initially the 43rd Division, {{later the}} 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division {{and then the}} 38th Infantry (Reserve) Division) of the British Army was active during both the First and Second World Wars. In 1914, the {{division}} was raised as the 43rd Division of Herbert Kitchener's New Army, and was originally intended to form part of a 50,000-strong Welsh Army Corps that had been championed by David Lloyd George; the assignment of Welsh recruits to other formations meant that this concept was never realised. The 43rd was renamed the 38th (Welsh) Division on 29 April 1915, and shipped to France later that year. It arrived in France with a poor reputation, seen as a political formation that was ill-trained and poorly led. The division's baptism by fire came {{in the first days}} of the Battle of the Somme, where it captured the strongly held Mametz Wood <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of nearly 4,000 men. This strongly held German position needed to be secured in order to facilitate the next phase of the Somme offensive; the Battle of Bazentin Ridge. Despite securing its objective, the division's reputation was adversely affected by miscommunication among senior officers.|$|E
5|$|The British {{capture of}} Martinique in 1809 marked a {{critical}} point for the French on Guadeloupe; blockaded on all sides by the naval forces of the British, the French civilians and soldiers were reduced to near starvation. In January 1810, the British initiated an invasion of Guadeloupe; Sir Alexander Cochrane's naval force landed 11,000 British troops {{under the command of}} Lieutenant General George Beckwith at the so-called Capesterre, or {{the eastern side of the}} islands. Attacked on three sides at the end of January, Ernouff's force mounted a spirited, although short, defense and capitulated on 6February 1810, after which he was transported to Britain. He was repatriated to France in a prisoner exchange in 1811. Irritated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of Guadeloupe to the British, Napoleon accused him of abuse of power, embezzlement, and treason. Ernouf spent 23months in captivity in France while the courts debated how to proceed.|$|E

5|$|The Whigs used George's {{death to}} their own advantage.

With Whigs now dominant in Parliament, and Anne distraught <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of her husband, they forced her to accept the Junto leaders Lords Somers and Wharton into the cabinet. Anne, however, insisted on carrying out the duties of Lord High Admiral herself, without appointing {{a member of the}} government to take George's place. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of the Earl of Orford, another member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as First Lord of the Admiralty. Anne appointed the moderate Earl of Pembroke, on 29 November 1708. Pressure mounted on Pembroke, Godolphin and the Queen from the dissatisfied Junto Whigs, and Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.|$|E
