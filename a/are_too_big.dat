5|$|One {{behavior}} is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens {{to a food}} bonanza, usually a carcass, {{with a series of}} loud yells. In Ravens in Winter, Bernd Heinrich posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away. A more mundane explanation is that individuals co-operate in sharing information about carcasses of large mammals because they <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> for just a few birds to exploit. Experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent {{of the size of the}} bait.|$|E
25|$|When a {{space is}} needed, the {{operator}} touches the spaceband lever {{just to the}} left of the keyboard. This releases a spaceband from the spaceband box. Spacebands are stored separately from the matrices because they <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to fit in the magazine.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} some {{biochemical}} poisons that {{are made up of}} large molecules that <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to pass through the blood–brain barrier. This was especially important in more primitive times when people often ate contaminated food. Neurotoxins such as botulinum in the food might affect peripheral nerves, but the blood–brain barrier can often prevent such toxins from reaching the central nervous system, where they could cause serious or fatal damage.|$|E

25|$|They {{primarily}} {{deal with}} parasitic infections. Eosinophils {{are also the}} predominant inflammatory cells in allergic reactions. The most important causes of eosinophilia include allergies such as asthma, hay fever, and hives; and also parasitic infections. They secrete chemicals that destroy these large parasites, such as hook worms and tapeworms, that <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> for any one WBC to phagocytize. In general, their nucleus is bi-lobed. The lobes are connected by a thin strand. The cytoplasm is full of granules that assume a characteristic pink-orange color with eosin staining.|$|E
25|$|Geysers: Geysers such as Old Faithful are {{a type of}} {{geothermal}} {{feature that}} periodically erupt scalding hot water. Increased pressure exerted by the enormous weight of the overlying rock and water prevents deeper water from boiling. As the hot water rises it is under less pressure and steam bubbles form. They, in turn, expand on their ascent until the bubbles <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> and numerous to pass freely through constrictions. At a critical point the confined bubbles actually lift the water above, causing the geyser to splash or overflow. This decreases {{the pressure of the}} system and violent boiling results. Large quantities of water flash into tremendous amounts of steam that force a jet of water out of the vent: an eruption begins. Water (and heat) is expelled faster than the geyser’s recharge rate, gradually decreasing the system’s pressure and eventually ending the eruption.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, cores {{are usually}} supported by two core prints in the mold. However, there are situations where a core only uses one core print so other means {{are required to}} support the cantilevered end. These are usually supplied {{in the form of}} chaplets. These are small metal supports that bridge the gap between the mold surface and the core. Since the chaplets become part of the casting, the chaplets must be of the same or similar material as the metal being cast. Moreover, their design must be optimized because if they are too small they will completely melt and allow the core to move, but if they <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> then their whole surface cannot melt and fuse with the poured metal. Their use should also be minimized because they can cause casting defects or create a weak spot in the casting. It is usually more critical to ensure the upper chaplets are stronger than the lower ones because the core will want to float up in the molten metal.|$|E

500|$|Americans {{have four}} basic ways of solving {{problems}} that <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> {{for individuals to}} handle by themselves. One is through the federal government. A second is through state governments and the local governments that the states create. The third is through the private sector– the economic sector that includes business, agriculture, and labor. The fourth method is the independent sector– the voluntary, cooperative action of free individuals and independent association. [...] Voluntary action {{is the most powerful}} of these, because it is uniquely capable of stirring the people themselves and involving their enthusiastic energies, because it is their own– voluntary action is the people's action. ...

Veitch said in 2008 that Christians commonly say that JC's Girls dress like sex workers, but she {{said that the}} look is intended to help women in the sex industry identify with the group. Annie Lobert of Hookers for Jesus, a similar group that collaborates with JC's Girls, said around the same time that Christians make the same kind of comments about her and her ministry—"They say my T-shirt is too tight", said Lobert, [...] "but, hey, when in Vegas, do as Vegas does".|$|E
500|$|Organizations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society {{campaign}} against the practice of keeping cetaceans, particularly killer whales, in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60–90% of male killer whales. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s. In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50–60 years. Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales' social groups are foreign {{to those found in}} the wild. Captive life is also stressful due the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild killer whale behavior, as well as restricting pool size. Wild killer whales may travel up to [...] in a day, and critics say the animals <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> and intelligent to be suitable for captivity.

40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE THESISHamlet <b>is</b> <b>Too</b> BigbyBrian SmolinMaster of Fine Arts in Theatre and Dance (Acting) University of California, San Diego, 2015 Professor Gregory D. Wallace, ChairWhile playing Hamlet, I {{often felt}} overwhelmed, {{stressed}} out, and afraid. I {{struggled with the}} daunting and difficult nature of the role, but within that struggle, I found {{a deeper understanding of}} many of the concepts central to my training at UCSD. I had to trust and rely on that training, because Hamlet <b>is</b> just <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to do otherwise. Hamlet <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to control. It's <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to <b>be</b> neat or safe. I had to let it to be a mess and allow myself to be wrong. Hamlet <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to play emotion. How could I ever be sad enough? I had to play actions instead. Hamlet <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to do all at once, and too vast to let the story go untold. I had to live one moment at a time and strive for clarity of thought and language. Hamlet <b>is</b> far <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to do alone. I had to listen to my cast mates, and allow them to affect, change, and lift me. Hamlet <b>is</b> <b>too</b> damn long, and too damn hard, not to have any fun, and I found joy and humor in places that I never expected. And lastly, Hamlet <b>is</b> far <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to ever <b>be</b> finished, and every performance was an opportunity to grow, and discover anew. Playing Hamlet forced me to be active, strive for clarity, discover, have fun, and much more. I'm a better actor now than when I started. Hamlet <b>is</b> just <b>too</b> <b>big</b> for anything less...|$|R
2500|$|The Canadian {{government}} {{claims that}} some of the waters of the Northwest Passage, particularly those in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, are internal waters of Canada, giving Canada the right to bar transit through these waters. Most maritime nations, including the United States and those of the European Union, classify these waters as an international strait, where foreign vessels have the right of [...] "transit passage". In such a regime, Canada would have the right to enact fishing and environmental regulation, and fiscal and smuggling laws, as well as laws intended for the safety of shipping, but not the right to close the passage. If the passage's deep waters become completely ice-free in summer months, they will be particularly enticing for supertankers that <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>big</b> to pass through the Panama Canal and must otherwise navigate around the tip of South America.|$|E
2500|$|Properly cooked {{couscous}} {{is light}} and fluffy, not gummy or gritty. Traditionally, North Africans use a food steamer (called aTaseksut in Berber, a [...] kiskas in Arabic or a couscoussier in French). The base {{is a tall}} metal pot shaped rather like an oil jar in which the meat and vegetables are cooked as a stew. On top of the base, a steamer sits where the couscous is cooked, absorbing the flavours from the stew. The lid to the steamer has holes around its edge so steam can escape. It is also possible to use a pot with a steamer insert. If the holes <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>big,</b> the steamer can be lined with damp cheesecloth. There is little archaeological evidence of early diets including couscous, possibly because the original couscoussier was probably made from organic materials that could not survive extended exposure to the elements.|$|E
