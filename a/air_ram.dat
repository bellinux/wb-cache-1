5000|$|At the 1995 (65th) Academy Awards Scientific and Technical Awards presentation, stunt {{performer}} Joe Finnegan (a.k.a. Joe Yrigoyen) was {{the recipient}} of a Technical Achievement Award for [...] "his pioneering work in developing the <b>Air</b> <b>Ram</b> for motion picture stunt effects." ...|$|E
50|$|He is {{well known}} for being {{risk-taking}} in the performance of his stunts. An example of his daredevilry is seen in his stunt execution for a television show called Side Factor. After performing multiple takes of propulsion into the air via an <b>air</b> <b>ram,</b> Master Chang wound up with a compound fracture.|$|E
25|$|The {{base engine}} was {{unchanged}} for 1970, but the low-compression economy engine was deleted and the <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> III and <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> IV remained available, although {{the latter was}} now a special-order option.|$|R
5000|$|The pitot {{pressure}} is {{obtained from the}} pitot tube. The {{pitot pressure}} {{is a measure of}} <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> pressure (the air pressure created by vehicle motion or the <b>air</b> <b>ramming</b> into the tube), which, under ideal conditions, is equal to stagnation pressure, also called total pressure. The pitot tube is most often located on the wing or front section of an aircraft, facing forward, where its opening is exposed to the relative wind. [...] By situating the pitot tube in such a location, the <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> pressure is more accurately measured since it will be less distorted by the aircraft's structure. When airspeed increases, the <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> pressure is increased, which can be translated by the airspeed indicator.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} design types but all <b>air</b> <b>rams</b> have a few design elements in common - they use compressed air and a surface area that the performer steps on—that is raised using the compressed air which then catapults the person forward.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>air</b> <b>ram</b> is a {{pneumatic}} {{device that}} catapults a stunt performer through the air. To simulate {{the effects of}} an explosion the performer steps on a large [...] "pedal" [...] and using compressed air the [...] "pedal" [...] is released sending the performer hurtling through the air. The distance and height the performer attains is dependent upon the air pressure set.|$|E
50|$|Ram powered {{jet engines}} are airbreathing engines similar to gas turbine engines {{and they both}} follow the Brayton cycle. Gas turbine and ram powered engines differ, however, in how they {{compress}} the incoming airflow. Whereas gas turbine engines use axial or centrifugal compressors to compress incoming <b>air,</b> <b>ram</b> engines rely only on air compressed through the inlet or diffuser. Ram powered engines are considered the most simple type of air breathing jet engine because they can contain no moving parts.|$|E
5000|$|On 24 May 1919, in Kiev a School of Aviation Mechanical Technicians was found. The {{aircraft}} repair shops and pilots' school - {{observers of the}} Kiev Polytechnical Institute - educational establishment {{where one of the}} first aviation society in Russia had been organized, were used as the school base. The members of this society were the aviation specialists who became famous later on: a pilot N. Nesterov the first one in the world who performed the [...] "dead loop" [...] and <b>air</b> <b>ram</b> attack; an aircraft designer I. Sikorsky - a founder of the first Russian heavy aircraft and a founder of the helicopter engineering in the USA.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to trouble}} getting the <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> option {{approved}} for emissions reasons, Ford offered an 'exterior decor' option in 1973 {{that consisted of}} the two-tone hood treatment, but without the actual functional components of the <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> system. Actual engine options available with <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> in 1973 were limited to the 351 2V, even though the 351 4V 'Cobra Jet' (without <b>Ram</b> <b>Air)</b> remained optional on every model.|$|R

50|$|DRACO: The DRACO is a {{multipurpose}} {{weapon station}} operating against <b>Air,</b> <b>R.A.M.</b> and Surface targets, {{designed for the}} Italian Army. The main armament consists of {{a high rate of}} fire 76/62mm gun with an automatic ammunition loading system; the 76/62mm gun is electrically controlled for elevation and traversing, and is stabilized in elevation. DRACO can be installed on 8x8 wheeled platforms, for combat support operations or convoy defence, as well as on tracked vehicles or on shelters for point defence. The main 76/62mm gun and the automatic loading system are fully compatible with all in service 76mm rounds and also with 76mm DART guided ammunition. DRACO can be completely controlled by two Operators (the Commander and the Gunner) from a remote position, located inside the hull for mobile installation or inside a protected command shelter for fixed installation.|$|E
5000|$|David Boreanaz's stunt double, Mike Massa, {{says the}} scene {{in which he is}} tossed across the room upside down is his {{favorite}} stunt of this season. To get the effect, he was shot across the room using an <b>air</b> <b>ram.</b> [...] "The reason I like it so much is because it really knocked the heck out of me," [...] he says. [...] "It was 900 pounds of thrust on the air-ram. I had to hit the corner just right. If I was off, if I hit dead center of the corner with my shoulders spread it could have broken a collarbone. I had to hit it sideways, my back flat to the wall and kind of skip into it, but it just pile drove me right to the ground." [...] Director Jim Contner [...] "was jumping up and down... He thought that was the best stunt he'd ever seen." ...|$|E
5000|$|To {{increase}} <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> recovery, {{nearly all}} jetliners use modulating vanes on the <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> exhaust. A [...] "ram air fan" [...] within the ram system provides <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> flow across the heat exchangers when the aircraft {{is on the}} ground. Nearly all modern fixed-wing aircraft use a fan on a common shaft with the ACM, powered by the ACM turbine.|$|R

2500|$|By this time, {{the gross}} power ratings of both <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> engines were highly suspect, bearing less {{relationship}} to developed power {{and more to}} an internal GM policy limiting all cars except the Corvette {{to no more than}} one advertised horsepower per [...] of curb weight. The higher-revving <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> IV's advertised power peak was actually listed at 5,000rpm—100rpm lower than the less-powerful <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> III.|$|R
2500|$|The engine line-up was {{slightly}} revised for 1969. All models, except Torino GTs and Cobras, came standard {{with a new}} larger [...] I-6 engine. The larger displacement produced more power and torque than the [...] engine. Optional engines included the -2V (standard on GTs), the new for 1969 -2V Windsor, 351-4V Windsor, -4V, and the -4V Cobra Jet (standard on Cobras). The 428 CJ was available {{with or without the}} <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> Induction package, however, those with <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> still carried the same advertised power rating. The 428 CJ without <b>Ram</b> <b>Air,</b> came with the following items: 80-ampere heavy-duty battery, 3.25:1 open differential, heavy-duty cooling package, 55-ampere alternator, chrome valve covers and dual exhaust. The <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> 428 CJ included all of the above, but had a 3.50:1 open differential, and the functional hood scoop. With <b>Ram</b> <b>Air,</b> [...] "428 Cobra Jet" [...] emblems were placed {{on each side of the}} hood scoop; without <b>Ram</b> <b>Air,</b> [...] "428" [...] emblems were placed on the front fender.

The {{difference}} between the GTO and Firebird engines was that the secondary carburetor's throttle linkage had a restrictor which prevented the rear barrels from opening completely, adjusting the linkage could allow full carburetor operation resulting in identical engine performance.|$|R
5000|$|The engine line-up was {{slightly}} revised for 1969. All models, except Torino GTs and Cobras, came standard {{with a new}} larger 250 cuin L I-6 engine. The larger displacement produced more power and torque than the 200 cuin L engine. Optional engines included the 302 cuin L-2V (standard on GTs), the new for 1969 351 cuin L-2V Windsor, 351-4V Windsor, 390 cuin L-4V, and the 428 cuin L-4V Cobra Jet (standard on Cobras).

500|$|The [...] "Phase 2A" [...] {{proposal}} {{was accepted by}} the Air Staff as the [...] Victor B.2, with Conway RCo.11 engines providing [...] The new Conway engines required redesigned enlarged intakes to provide the greater airflow required. The wingtips were extended, increasing the wingspan to 120ft (36.6m). The B.2 featured distinctive retractable [...] "elephant ear" [...] intakes not found on the B.1, located on the rear fuselage forward of the tail fin. These scoops fed <b>ram</b> <b>air</b> to <b>Ram</b> <b>Air</b> Turbines (RAT) which could provide electrical power during emergency situations, such as engine failure, during flight.|$|R
