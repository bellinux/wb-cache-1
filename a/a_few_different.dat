5|$|<b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>different</b> animals {{establish}} commensal {{interactions with}} L.gigas, {{which means that}} both organisms maintain a relationship that benefits (the commensal) species but not the other (in this case, the queen conch). Commensals of this species include certain mollusks, mainly slipper shells (Crepidula spp.) The porcelain crab Porcellana sayana is also {{known to be a}} commensal and a small cardinalfish, known as the conch fish (Astrapogon stellatus), sometimes shelters in the conch's mantle for protection.|$|E
5|$|A base such as spermine has <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>different</b> {{sites where}} {{protonation}} can occur. In this example the first proton {{can go on}} the terminal –NH2 group, or either of the internal –NH– groups. The pKa values for dissociation of spermine protonated at one or other of the sites are examples of micro-constants. They cannot be determined directly by means of pH, absorbance, fluorescence or NMR measurements. Nevertheless, the site of protonation {{is very important for}} biological function, so mathematical methods have been developed for the determination of micro-constants.C NMR Data Processed by the New Computer Program HypNMR2000.

5|$|The F-84 {{nomenclature}} can {{be somewhat}} confusing. The straight-wing F-84A to F-84E and F-84G models were called the Thunderjet. The F-84F Thunderstreak and RF-84F Thunderflash were different airplanes with swept wings. The XF-84H Thunderscreech (not its official name) was an experimental turboprop {{version of the}} F-84F. The F-84F swept wing version {{was intended to be}} a small variation of the normal Thunderjet with only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>different</b> parts, so it kept the basic F-84 number. Production delays on the F-84F resulted in another order of the straight-wing version; this was the F-84G.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality have taken <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>different</b> directions. Matters {{such as the}} sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the age of}} {{the auto}} trail, the roads that later formed US2 through the UP were given <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>different</b> highway names. When the {{original}} roadways between Ironwood and Iron River were completed in late 1915, the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau (UPDB) named the area Cloverland and the highway the Cloverland Trail. Later the name was extended over the highway to Escanaba, and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s; the name was phased out by the UPDB completely in 1927. The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919. Overall, this highway ran from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. Through the UP, the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US2, including the section through Florence County, Wisconsin.|$|E

5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>different</b> bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

Estuaries provide an unstable environment for fish, where the salinity changes and the waters are often muddy and turbulent. In warmer climates, estuaries have mangroves around their edges.

25|$|Endocrine {{disruption}} as a mode {{of action}} for xenobiotics was brought into awareness by Our Stolen Future by Theo Colborn. Endocrine disrupting chemicals are known to accumulate in body tissue and are highly persistent in the environment. Many toxicants are known EDCs including pesticides, phthalates, phytoestrogens, some industrial/commercial products, and pharmaceuticals. These chemicals are known to cause endocrine disruption via <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>different</b> mechanisms. While the mechanism associated with the thyroid hormone receptor is not well understood, two more established mechanisms involve the inhibition of the androgen receptor and activation of the estrogen receptor.|$|E
25|$|There are <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>different</b> ways to {{properly}} muffle a marching bass drum. If the tuner uses generic weather-stripping type foam, start with medium density. If inexperienced {{or do not}} know how much foam to apply, the person should apply it to the outside of the head after he/she has put the head onto the drum. Once drum is tuned to the right pitch, make a note of how much foam was applied for future head changes. At that time, apply the foam {{to the inside of the}} head before its placed on the drum. This provides a cleaner look to the drumhead and will protect the foam from falling from the player's beating and the environment.|$|E

25|$|If the {{emitting}} and absorbing nuclei were in identical chemical environments, {{the nuclear}} transition energies would be exactly equal and resonant absorption would be observed with both materials at rest. The difference in chemical environments, however, causes the nuclear energy levels to shift in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>different</b> ways, as described below. Although these energy shifts are tiny (often {{less than a}} micro-electronvolt), the extremely narrow spectral linewidths of gamma rays for some radionuclides make the small energy shifts correspond to large changes in absorbance. To bring the two nuclei back into resonance {{it is necessary to}} change the energy of the gamma ray slightly, and in practice this is always done using the Doppler effect.|$|E
25|$|A {{consumer}} {{version of}} the Shelby GT-H was available from Shelby through Ford dealers, called the Shelby GT. There were 5,682 vehicles for 2007 and 2,300 for 2008 were built. They had the same engine as the GT-H, but more suspension, appearance and drivetrain upgrades and was available with either manual or automatic transmission. White and black colors were available for 2007 models and grabber orange or vista blue were available for 2008. A convertible was available in 2008 also. An available upgrade from the Shelby factory in Las Vegas were <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>different</b> superchargers. It then was called a Shelby GT/SC.

25|$|There {{are quite}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>{{different}}</b> dielectrics {{that can be}} chosen to provide different insulating values depending on {{the requirements of the}} circuit.
