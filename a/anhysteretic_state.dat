40|$|An automated, {{non-destructive}} anhysteretic magnetization {{characterization method}} for studying and modeling soft magnetic materials. This measurement method employs a “reading-waveform” that allows multiple points of reference {{to be established}} in tracing out the B waveform. In using the reference values from this waveform, the components of B that cannot be measured directly may be calculated with precision. In turn, the initial magnitude of the B waveform is identified as the unknown component of the <b>anhysteretic</b> <b>state.</b> The processes can be repeated for different values of static fields {{as well as a}} function of temperature to produce a family of anhysteretic magnetization curves. The core characterization was performed without physically altering the core, so that the true anhysteretic magnetization curve, and the true B-H loop under applied bias H, is measured...|$|E
