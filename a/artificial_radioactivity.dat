5|$|Oppenheimer {{worked with}} his first {{doctoral}} student, Melba Phillips, on calculations of <b>artificial</b> <b>radioactivity</b> under bombardment by deuterons. When Ernest Lawrence and Edwin McMillan bombarded nuclei with deuterons they found the results agreed closely with the predictions of George Gamow, but when higher energies and heavier nuclei were involved, the results did not conform to the theory. In 1935, Oppenheimer and Phillips worked out a theory {{now known as the}} Oppenheimer–Phillips process to explain the results, a theory still in use today.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Rona {{was back}} in Paris {{studying}} with Joliot-Curie, who had discovered <b>artificial</b> <b>radioactivity.</b> Soon after, Curie died and Rona became ill, but {{she was able to}} return to Vienna late the following year to share what had been learned with a group of researchers made up of Pettersson, Elizabeth Kara-Michailova, and Ernst Føyn, who was serving as an assistant to Ellen Gleditsch at that time. Their studies centered on research of the effect caused by bombarding radionuclides with neutrons. In 1935 Rona consolidated some of these relationships, working on Stora Bornö, then visiting Gleditsch in Oslo, then traveling to Copenhagen to see Hevesy, and later to Kålhuvudet, Sweden to meet with Karlik and Pettersson. One of the projects the group had been working on for several years was to determine if there was any correlation between water depth and radium content, and their seawater research evaluated the concentration of elements in seawater collected from different locations.|$|E
40|$|Background {{levels of}} {{radioactivity}} {{in the marine}} environment along the Pacific Coast are at present extremely low. However, these certainly will rise along {{with the growth of}} coastal populations and with the increased use of nuclear energy. It would be desirable to anticipate where and how fast concentrations of <b>artificial</b> <b>radioactivities</b> may reach unacceptable levels in coastal water. Successful prediction of this sort requires knowing how the ocean responds, in given regions, to specific inputs. Fortunately, some of the fate of a large class of radioactive pollutants that must be faced in the future may be inferred from careful studies during the past 20 years of the behavior of certain constituents of nuclear fallout that have entered the ocean along the coasts of California and Baja California.

5000|$|A {{measuring}} station for the permanent {{monitoring of the}} <b>artificial</b> and natural <b>radioactivity</b> in the atmosphere has existed on the Schauinsland since 1957. It was integrated into the newly founded federal agency for radiation protection in 1989. Among other devices to measure traces of radioactivity in the air, the [...] "Ortsdosisleistungs-Messnetz" [...] and {{the supervision of the}} adherence to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) takes place there.|$|R
30|$|<b>Artificial</b> {{and natural}} <b>radioactivities</b> {{are the two}} main sources of {{radiation}} exposure. Human activities such as mining and mining processes, oil and gas extraction may result in situations where the radioactivity levels of materials that contain natural radionuclides are significant enough to warrant regulatory control (UNSCEAR 2000; IAEA 2005). The two main sources of natural radiation exposure are from terrestrial radionuclides and cosmogenic radionuclides. They lead to external and internal radiation exposure. This study focused on levels of radioactivity due terrestrial radionuclides. The radionuclides of interest are Uranium- 238 and Thorium- 232 and their decay series nuclides as well as Potassium- 40.|$|R
25|$|Also in 1934, Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie {{discovered}} that <b>artificial</b> <b>radioactivity</b> could be induced in stable elements by bombarding them with alpha particles; Enrico Fermi reported similar results when bombarding uranium with neutrons.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} nuclear {{medicine}} contains contributions from scientists across different disciplines in physics, chemistry, engineering, and medicine. The multidisciplinary nature of nuclear medicine {{makes it difficult}} for medical historians to determine the birthdate of nuclear medicine. This can probably be best placed between the discovery of <b>artificial</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in 1934 and the production of radionuclides by Oak Ridge National Laboratory for medicine related use, in 1946.|$|E
25|$|According to the French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, between 21March and mid-July around 27PBq of caesium-137 {{entered the}} ocean, about 82percent before 8April. This {{emission}} represents {{the most important}} individual oceanic emissions of <b>artificial</b> <b>radioactivity</b> ever observed. The Fukushima coast {{has one of the}} world's strongest currents (Kuroshio Current). It transported the contaminated waters far into the Pacific Ocean, dispersing the radioactivity. As of late 2011 measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments suggested that the consequences for marine life would be minor. Significant pollution along the coast near the plant might persist, because of the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported to the sea by surface water crossing contaminated soil. The possible presence of other radioactive substances, such as strontium-90 or plutonium, has not been sufficiently studied. Recent measurements show persistent contamination of some marine species (mostly fish) caught along the Fukushima coast. Migratory pelagic species are highly effective and rapid transporters of radioactivity throughout the ocean. Elevated levels of caesium-134 appeared in migratory species off the coast of California that were not seen pre-Fukushima.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{continue}} with the Research Program in Environmental Radioactivity in the Antarctic Region initiated in 1996, the Peruvian Institute of Nuclear Energy (IPEN) participated in the 11 th Scientific Expedition to Antarctica (ANTAR XI) on 2000. The main objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate environmental components for achieving a baseline study related to <b>artificial</b> and natural <b>radioactivity</b> level. For this purpose, samples of brown macro-algae (Phaeophyta), lichen, moss, gramineous, soil, marine sediment, sea water and air were collected in the surrounding area of the Machu Picchu Scientific Station. The physical, radiochemical treatment and radiometric assays of the samples were done in the Environmental Control Department of the "RACSO" Nuclear Center. The presence of anthropogenic radionuclide Cs- 137, in some antarctic environmental components, confirms that this element was dispersed globally after the nuclear testing carried out in other latitudes. The environmental radiological impact in the antarctic ecosystem has been minimum due to the low levels of found radioactivity. In general, lichens seem to accumulate more Cs- 137 than other biological components...|$|R
40|$|One of {{approaches}} under {{the development of}} radioactive waste treatment conception {{is based on the}} principle of natural and <b>artificial</b> radioactive series <b>radioactivity</b> equivalency. The basic natural radioactive elements are included into four radioactive series (Tab. l). These are: thorium series, neptunium series, uranium series and uranium-actinium series. All of radioactive series articles are bond by irreversible reciprocal transformations. Therefore closed systems reach the equilibrium during the definite period. Natural series contains the radioactive elements accumulated during millions of years. Great quantities of the radioactive daughter isotopes are in equilibrium with uranium and thorium (Tab. l). The series elements are take out thanks to geochemical processes, difference of physical and chemical properties and miming [1]. Thus the system may be opened. It causes the breach of radioactive equilibrium. Therefore it is necessary to know the system open state degree and time to estimate the series radioactivity. The reactor actinides are predecessors for defined radioactive series. The actinide production depends on correlation between fission and capture cross-section and neutron spectrum. Consequently it depends on fuel kind and reactor type. Thus the thermal reactor produces more neptunium serie...|$|R
40|$|Gamma {{radiation}} in {{the environment}} is mainly due to naturally occurring radionuclides. However, {{there is also a}} contribution from anthropogenic radionuclides such as 137 Cs which originate from nuclear fission processes. Since 1986, the accident at the Chernobyl power plant has been a significant source of <b>artificial</b> environmental <b>radioactivity.</b> In order to assess the radiological impact of these radionuclides, it is necessary to measure their activities in samples drawn from the environment and in plants and animals including human populations. The whole body counter (WBC) at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff makes in vivo measurements of gamma emitting radionuclides using a scanning ring of six large-volume thallium-doped sodium iodide (Nal(Tl)) scintillation detectors. In this work the WBC was upgraded by the addition of two high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. The performance and suitability of the detection systems were evaluated by comparing the detection limits for Cs. Sensitivities were measured using sources of known activity in a water filled anthropomorphic phantom and theoretical minimum detectable count-rates were estimated from phantom background pulse height spectra. The theoretical minimum detectable activity was about 24 Bq for the combination of six Nal(Tl) detectors whereas for the individual HPGe detectors it was 64 Bq and 65 Bq, despite the much improved energy resolution Activities of 137 Cs in the human body between 1993 and 2007 were estimated from the background Nal(Tl) spectra of 813 patients and compared with recent measurements in 14 volunteers. The body burden of Cs in Cardiff patients increased from an average of about 60 Bq in the early and mid 1990 s to a maximum of about 100 Bq in 2000. By 2007 it had decreased to about 40 Bq. This latter value was similar to that of Cardiff residents {{at the time of the}} Chernobyl accident and to that of the volunteers measured in 2007 (51 Bq). However, it was less than the mean activity of Cardiff residents in 1988 (130 Bq) indicating an overall decrease over a period of about 20 years. The variation in the in vivo activity is probably due to complex inter-relationships between a number of factors such as the removal of deposited 137 Cs into the sea by rainfall, individual dietary choices, the imposition and removal of restrictions on foodstuffs from Chernobyl-affected areas and travel to countries that suffered greater initial fall-out than the UK...|$|R
25|$|According to {{a report}} {{published}} in October 2011 by the French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, between 21 March and mid-July around 2.7×1016Bq of caesium-137 (about 8.4kg) entered the ocean, about 82percent having flowed into the sea before 8 April. This emission of radioactivity into the sea represents the most important individual emission of <b>artificial</b> <b>radioactivity</b> into the sea ever observed. However, the Fukushima coast {{has some of the}} world's strongest currents and these transported the contaminated waters far into the Pacific Ocean, thus causing great dispersion of the radioactive elements. The results of measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments led to the supposition that the consequences of the accident, in terms of radioactivity, would be minor for marine life as of autumn 2011 (weak concentration of radioactivity in the water and limited accumulation in sediments). On the other hand, significant pollution of sea water along the coast near the nuclear plant might persist, because of the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported towards the sea by surface water running over contaminated soil. Further, some coastal areas might have less-favorable dilution or sedimentation characteristics than those observed so far. Finally, the possible presence of other persistent radioactive substances, such as strontium-90 or plutonium, has not been sufficiently studied. Recent measurements show persistent contamination of some marine species (mostly fish) caught along the coast of Fukushima district. Organisms that filter water and fish {{at the top of the}} food chain are, over time, the most sensitive to caesium pollution. It is thus justified to maintain surveillance of marine life that is fished in the coastal waters off Fukushima. Despite caesium isotopic concentration in the waters off of Japan being 10 to 1000 times above concentration prior to the accident, radiation risks are below what is generally considered harmful to marine animals and human consumers.|$|E

40|$|There is {{widespread}} {{contamination of the}} environment of the Niger Delta, which may include enhanced background levels of naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) due to oil production and rapid urbanization activities. Sediments and seafood from the Bonny estuary, Niger Delta, were collected for the purpose of determining baseline data on <b>artificial</b> and natural <b>radioactivity</b> and estimation of effective doses for the public due to ingestion of seafood from the study area. The highest and lowest activity concentrations were reported for 40 K and 137 Cs in both sediments and fish samples of the Bonny estuary. There was some evidence of spatial variability in the 40 K and 137 Cs data, with the latter being the likely result of dredging. Other radionuclides were not significantly different between sites impacted by industrial activities or not. Activity of radionuclides measured in the sediments of the study area were higher than reported elsewhere in the Niger Delta and Nigeria and higher than reported global averages by UNSCEAR. The total highest activity concentration in all fish species of gamma emitting radionuclides was observed for 40 K, followed by 238 U, 232 Th and 226 Ra, respectively, while 137 Cs had the lowest activity concentration. However, 210 Po activities were the most important in terms of dose contribution. Consumption of molluscs at typical rates could result in doses exceeding 1 mSv·y− 1. Although this baseline data may not be conclusive on prevailing trends in radioactivity in the study area, higher consumption rates of the species studied may have public health consequences due to effects of low dose ionising radiation...|$|R
