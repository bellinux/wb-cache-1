40|$|Sodium lignosulfonate (SL) {{fractions}} {{with narrow}} {{molecular weight distribution}} and known salt content were used to investigate – stacking of the <b>aromatic</b> <b>groups</b> in SL. Results show that the charge-free <b>aromatic</b> <b>groups</b> of SL tend to form oriented – stacking with the spectroscopic characteristics of J–aggregates. The formation of J–aggregates in SL are recognized by a significant spectral red shift in fluorescent excitation spectra. The other effects that may cause spectral shift, such as the SL species, solvent effect, and the impurities, are investigated {{to confirm that the}} formation of J-aggregates is the only viable explanation for the significant spectral redshift of SL. Salt causes molecular shrinkage of SL polyelectrolytes, but has no influence on J–aggregates of the <b>aromatic</b> <b>groups</b> as detected by lack of spectral shift, indicating that the <b>aromatic</b> <b>groups</b> are charge-free. This suggests that not all the <b>aromatic</b> <b>groups</b> but only the charge-free <b>aromatic</b> <b>groups</b> can form – stacking. This work demonstrates the presence of J–aggregation in aqueous SL solutions for the first time, which gives an insight in understanding the preferred orientation of the <b>aromatic</b> <b>groups</b> in lignin-based biopolymers...|$|R
50|$|A {{fluorophore}} (or fluorochrome, {{similarly to}} a chromophore) is a fluorescent chemical compound that can re-emit light upon light excitation. Fluorophores typically contain several combined <b>aromatic</b> <b>groups,</b> or planar or cyclic molecules with several π bonds.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} N-monoalkylsubstituted 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro- 9 -aminoacridines have been {{prepared}} after modelling simulation of the AChE–inhibitor complex.

50|$|Polymers are a {{significant}} source of smoke. <b>Aromatic</b> side <b>groups,</b> e.g. in polystyrene, enhance generation of smoke. <b>Aromatic</b> <b>groups</b> integrated in the polymer backbone produce less smoke, likely due to significant charring. Aliphatic polymers tend to generate the least smoke, and are non-self-extinguishing. However presence of additives can significantly increase smoke formation. Phosphorus-based and halogen-based flame retardants decrease production of smoke. Higher degree of cross-linking between the polymer chains has such effect too.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the ligand {{is not completely}} understood, Buchwald et al. suggest some structural {{factors that contribute to}} their effectiveness: the electron rich phosphine group may help the acceleration of the oxidative addition step, the steric bulk of the ligands may accelerate the C-N bond forming reductive elimination, and the π-system of the ortho <b>aromatic</b> <b>group</b> on the ligand may participate in an interaction with the unoccupied metal d-orbital. Another hypothesis is that the metal-arene interaction could stabilize the catalyst. The arene from the aryl halide is forced to orient perpendicularly to the N-Pd bond, which should stereoelectronically favor reductive elimination.|$|E
