40|$|Abstract [...] - Walking Line Assembly (WLA) is {{performed}} by positioning workers along assembly line at every process {{stations in the}} production line as and when required. This has benefitted the assembly and fabrication industry {{without the need for}} a dedicated layout, thereby leading to reduction in the fixed costs. This paper describes the application of WLA in prototype fabrication of yoke sub-assembly and details its effectiveness. The WLA procedure is described in two parts: Part I presents the technical aspects and challenges involved in development and fabrication of engine mount yoke tube assembly for a civil aircraft. This highlights the importance and significance of the parts, brackets, dimensional robustness, procedures, <b>assembly,</b> <b>jigs</b> and fixtures associated and the necessity of categorizing it as Class- 1. Activities representing reverse engineering process and fabrication of yoke tube are detailed comprehensively. Part II presents the WLA model adopted for this assembly. Comparison with conventional methods and layouts of fixed and walking line assembly are done. Further, WLA is modified with a common stage set on every process where the expected capability of the task in shop floor is brought out in consensus with the operational demand and standards. This is achieved with very little disturbance to the existing aircraft fixed line fabrication set up. This model has given encouraging results by expediting the processes and provides an ideal option for building of prototypes in development stage of an aircraft project.

It {{includes}} three parts: the 400 -fiber positioning system, the focal plane imager (FPI) and the prime focus corrector. The Echidna positioner concept {{and the role of}} the AAO in the FMOS project have been described in previous SPIE proceedings. The many components for the system are now being manufactured, after prototype tests have demonstrated that the required performance will be achieved. In this paper, the techniques developed to overcome key mechanical and electronic engineering challenges for the positioner and the FPI are described. The major performance requirement is that all 400 science fiber cores and up to 14 guide fiber bundles are to be re-positioned to an accuracy of 10 µm within 10 minutes. With the fast prime focus focal ratio, a close tolerance on the axial position of the fiber tips must also be held so efficiency does not suffer from de-focus. Positioning accuracy is controlled with the help of the FPI, which measures the positions of the fiber tips to an accuracy of a few µm and allows iterative positioning. Maintaining fiber tips sufficiently co-planar requires accurate control in the assembly of the several components that contribute to such errors. <b>Assembly</b> <b>jigs</b> have been developed and proven adequate for this purpose.

40|$|The only {{solution}} to the global energy mess is sunlight captured in space. No other technology scales as well, and is as clean as Space Solar Power. Best of all, this is baseload power – “always on” – without the intermittency which will always plague ground-based solar and wind. Although invented in 1968, SSP designs have been impractical until now. A novel design architecture, relying on use of materials already in space, enables SSP at costs competitive with existing baseload power sources. And all this without greenhouse gas emissions. This work describes the technology and economics. The “tin can” solar power satellite is comprised of a cylindrical shell of solar panels. This configuration has integral thermal management by using the non-illuminated portions of the shell as a radiating heat shield, maintaining the solar cells within workable temperature ranges. The tethers holding the shell to the central conductor spire present a complex radiative environment which is studied further herein to obtain a more precise measurement {{of high and low}} temperature limits. Heat generated by the transmitting antenna and its power electronics is also studied to understand its impact on the requirements imposed on components and subsystems. Achieving a slow rotation of a very large diameter cylindrical shell with minimal internal strength interacts with the assembly process through tradeoffs between propellant, <b>assembly</b> <b>jigs,</b> and construction spacecraft. Vibrations induced in the cylindrical shell are studied including transient behavior during spin-up. The panel-to-panel forces expected during spin-up, and during on-going operations as gravity gradients excite low-frequency modes are studied in order to derive specifications for linkage rotation and strength. Finally, the results of imperfect assembly, lost parts, and meteorite strikes are investigated to assess risk to other spacecraft. Solar wind pressure is evaluated to determine station-keeping requirements. Assembly in an orbit slightly higher than GEO may be selected to minimize collateral damages, and means of adjusting the orbit are studied to derive overall architecture propellant requirements, anticipating a mixture of in situ propellant options versus earth-sourced propellants.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Pedagogy: Procedures, Scaffolds, Strategies, Tactics 24 th National Conference on the Beginning Design StudentShop safety courses have long been the only way to introduce beginning design students to the tools, methods and appropriate behaviors in the shop environment. These courses and programs are geared towards providing important knowledge so the student can successfully engage the shop. However, they lack hands on experience and can often lead to creating a culture of fear with some students around certain tools and operations. The wood shop acclimation project is executed shortly after students take the shop safety course and prior to being asked to make anything in the shop on their own. It is provided to allow for greater hands on instruction for each student, creating in the students a better sense of confidence in operating the equipment safely and efficiently. The project was conceived as a way to efficiently mass produce a specific item that each student would be required to build to support their current studio project in some way, as a site or as a display. The faculty designs these items and the students would be shown why the item was designed the way it was. Often highlighting economy of means as major design consideration. Since each project always uses plywood as its main material the dimensions of that sheet in relation to each item's components are carefully calculated to minimize scrap. Instilling in the students an important lesson in valuing material. A step-by-step process is designed and laid out for the students. It takes them from a full sheet of plywood to the final assembled item. Along the way certain tools such as the panel saw, table saw and compound sliding miter saw are described {{in terms of what they}} do well and why they are being chosen to perform the specific operation in the process. As an extension to the shop safety course, students are given three concepts to apply to each tool in order to operate it safely and without damage to it, them or the material. These concepts are feed, guide and support and are described at each part of the process on each tool. This gives the students a starting point to correctly evaluate how they need to use the machines properly. Lastly throughout the process students are given an introduction into the appropriate use of jigs and fixtures to aid in the process of mass-producing the item. This stresses the importance of planning out the sequence of how you make something as well as supporting the decision of which tool to use for a specific operation. For example a sled is made for the table saw with multiple fixtures attached to it allowing each part to be cut efficiently and precisely with out measuring that can often lead to error. Also <b>assembly</b> <b>jigs</b> are made so that holes can be drilled identically without the need to measure and mark. The wood shop acclimation project not only serves as an important safety and instructional tool but also as a means to show the students via the design process a way to consider construction, fabrication sequencing and logic related to material and fabrication processes. And most importantly instill in the students a high level of knowledge driven comfort in engaging the wood shop...|$|R

Differences in insertion torque value were related to differences in the morphology of the white layer.

The white layer area remains small when the implant design is parallel and torque increases gradually.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} a concept that shows a way to {{automatically}} create a point-based tolerance analysis model out of existing development data. Nowadays solutions for an automated tolerance simulation model creation are using a static approach for the model build-up. For this purpose product-/ production- development data are automatically mapped on preexisting models (e. g. skeleton models). If chances during development process occur, the tolerance simulation models have to be reworked. Today only simple changes in the model can be automated (e. g. change of distribution, tolerance range etc.). A complete new tolerance simulation model build-up process for dynamically changing product-/ production- development information is not possible. To give an application example, tolerance simulation models for sheet metal parts in automotive industry are based on different development data. Before the first simulation model is created (to secure the tolerance concepts etc.), all necessary information have already been developed, e. g. in the automotive industry's development process: part geometry, tolerance information, <b>assembly</b> graph, <b>jig</b> and fixture concept, joining location and measurement points. Thus the automated simulation generation should be possible. First step is to describe an interface for a dynamic model creation in tolerance simulation systems. In a second step preprocessing of development data is necessary to map them into tolerance simulation software restrictions. This delivers a solution {{to fill the gap}} between the PDM-/ CAD and the CAT-system. The considered approach for automated tolerance simulation model creation provides the opportunity to build-up the tolerance analysis models highly efficient and almost automatically. Tolerance analysis can then be used to rapidly calculate several options. This offers the possibility to increase the product maturity level at a very early stage of the development process...|$|R
