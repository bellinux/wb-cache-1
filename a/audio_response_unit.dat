50|$|In telecommunications, an <b>audio</b> <b>response</b> <b>unit</b> (ARU) is {{a device}} that {{provides}} synthesized voice responses to DTMF keypresses by processing calls based on (a) the call-originator input, (b) information received from a database, and (c) information in the incoming call, such {{as the time of}} day. ARUs increase the number of information calls handled and provide consistent quality in information retrieval.|$|E
50|$|From 1965 to 1970 he was Project Director for the ARPA {{sponsored}} CONCOMP (Research in Conversational Use of Computers) Project. He {{was involved}} {{in the design of the}} architecture and negotiations with IBM over the virtual memory features that would be included in what became the IBM S/360 Model 67 computer. When IBM's TSS/360 time-sharing operating system for the S/360-67 was not available, the CONCOMP project supported the initial development of Michigan Terminal System (MTS) in cooperation with the staff of the University of Michigan Computing Center. This included David L. Mills development of the original PDP-8 Data Concentrator with its interface to an IBM S/360 Input/Output channel, the first such interface to be built outside of IBM. CONCOMP also developed the IBM 7772 based <b>Audio</b> <b>Response</b> <b>Unit</b> (ARU) as an I/O device for use with MTS, the MAD/I compiler, mini-computer based graphics terminals, and the Set-Theoretic Data Structure model that was later used in ILIR:MICRO.|$|E
50|$|Monitored alarm systemsAMCO {{provides}} both standard monitored alarms {{as well as}} immediate <b>audio</b> <b>response</b> monitored alarms - {{also known}} as listen-in alarm monitoring. Immediate <b>audio</b> <b>response</b> monitoring means that when an alarm is activated, a signal is sent immediately to a remote monitoring station allowing the monitoring station to listen and talk into the property via a speaker/microphone unit (installed in the property). In {{the case of a}} registered emergency, the monitoring station can then call the property keyholders and the emergency services (e.g., police {{in the case of a}} burglary or the Fire Services in the case of a fire). It is the immediate <b>audio</b> <b>response</b> monitoring which AMCO is most well known for.|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} with rats examined {{the roles of}} demarcating stimuli and differential reinforcement probability {{on the development of}} functional <b>response</b> <b>units.</b> It examined the development of units in a probabilistic, free-operant situation in which the presence of demarcating stimuli was manipulated. In all conditions, behavior became organized into two-response sequences framed by changes in local reinforcement probability. A tone demarcating {{the beginning and end of}} contingent response sequences facilitated the development of functional <b>response</b> <b>units,</b> as in chunking, but the same units developed slowly in the absence of the tone. Complex functional <b>response</b> <b>units</b> developed even though reinforcement contigencies remained constant. These findings demonstrate that models of operant learning must include a mechanism for changing the <b>response</b> <b>unit</b> as a function of reinforcement history. Markov models may seem to be a natural technique for modeling response sequences because of their ability to predict individual responses as a function of reinforcement history; however, no class of Markov chain can incorporate changing <b>response</b> <b>units</b> in their predictions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCarbamoylphosphate synthetase-I is the flux-determining enzyme of the {{ornithine}} cycle, and neutralizes toxic ammonia by converting it to urea. An 80 bp glucocorticoid <b>response</b> <b>unit</b> located 6. 3 kb upstream of {{the transcription}} start site mediates hormone responsiveness and liver-specific expression of carbamoylphosphate synthetase-I. The glucocorticoid <b>response</b> <b>unit</b> consists of <b>response</b> elements for the glucocorticoid receptor, forkhead box A, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, and an unidentified protein. With only four transcription factor response elements, the carbamoylphosphate synthetase-I glucocorticoid <b>response</b> <b>unit</b> {{is a relatively}} simple unit. The relationship between carbamoylphosphate synthetase-I expression and in vivo occupancy of the response elements was examined by comparing a carbamoylphosphate synthetase-I-expressing hepatoma cell line with a carbamoylphosphate synthetase-I-negative fibroblast cell line. DNaseI hypersensitivity assays revealed an open chromatin configuration of the carbamoylphosphate synthetase-I enhancer in hepatoma cells only. In vivo footprinting assays showed that the accessory transcription factors of the glucocorticoid <b>response</b> <b>unit</b> bound to their response elements in carbamoylphosphate synthetase-I-positive cells, irrespective of whether carbamoylphosphate synthetase-I expression was induced with hormones. In contrast, the binding of glucocorticoid receptor to the carbamoylphosphate synthetase-I glucocorticoid <b>response</b> <b>unit</b> was dependent on treatment of the cells with glucocorticoids. Only forkhead box A was exclusively present in hepatoma cells, and therefore {{appears to be an}} important determinant of the observed tissue specificity of carbamoylphosphate synthetase-I expression. As the glucocorticoid receptor is the only DNA-binding protein specifically recruited to the glucocorticoid <b>response</b> <b>unit</b> upon stimulation by glucocorticoids, {{it is likely to be}} directly responsible for the transcriptional activation mediated by the glucocorticoid <b>response</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|R
