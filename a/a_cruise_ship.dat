5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of systems that developed, only one {{tropical}} cyclone, the second hurricane, managed to make landfall during the season. It severely impacted areas of the Greater Antilles, particularly the Dominican Republic, before making subsequent landfalls on Cuba and the U.S. states of Florida and North Carolina, with less severe effects. The estimated 2,000 to 8,000deaths caused by the storm in the Dominican Republic alone ranked it as one of the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history. No other storms affected any landmasses during the year, although the first storm damaged <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> in open waters.|$|E
5|$|Other Australian {{locations}} mentioned {{and sometimes}} {{seen in the}} series include the fictitious suburbs of West Waratah, Eden Hills, and Anson's Corner.

5|$|The Glacier Bay {{has many}} branches, inlets, lagoons, islands, and {{channels}} that holds prospects for scientific exploration and visual treat. Thus, {{the area is}} popular as <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> destination during summer season. However, there are restrictions imposed by the National Park Service on the numbers of vessels that can operate in a day to 2 cruise ships, 3 tour boats, 6 charter vessels, and 25 private vessels. According to National Park Service statistics for calendar year 2009, 444,653 people visited Glacier Bay, with 422,919 of those being cruise ship passengers.|$|E
5|$|While passing to {{the south}} of the island, the tight {{pressure}} gradient between the precursor extratropical storm and high pressures resulted in strong winds on the island, including sustained winds of hurricane status at Fort George. Gusts on the island officially peaked at 100mph (161km/h) at Devonshire. <b>A</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> anchored at harbor reported a wind gust of 118mph (190km/h), though it could have been caused by a downdraft. The storm also dropped moderate rainfall of just over 3inches (76mm), resulting in minor flooding of streets. Because the storm developed quickly, wave-induced beach erosion was minor.|$|E
5|$|De Bont came up {{with the}} idea for the film after he had a {{recurring}} nightmare about <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> crashing into an island. Speed star Keanu Reeves was initially supposed to reprise his role as Jack Traven for the sequel, but decided not to commit and was replaced by Patric prior to filming. Production took place aboard Seabourn Legend, the ship on which the film is set. The film's final scene, when the ship crashes into the island of Saint Martin, cost almost a quarter of the film's budget, and set records as the largest and most expensive stunt ever filmed. Many interior scenes aboard the ship were shot on soundstages in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The film's soundtrack featured mostly reggae music. Mark Mancina returned to compose the film score, which was released as an album 13 years after the film's release.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{survey is}} focused on {{providing}} <b>a</b> <b>cruising</b> <b>ship</b> with Internet access facilities. On a ship, the entire network infrastructure (networks, subnets, devices, terminals, etc.) is subject to mobility. Multiple connections (e. g., satellite, LTE, 3 G, WiFi, etc.) can provide Internet access, thus making the ship multihomed, but the different connections may be sporadic, and provide different services in terms of bandwidth, throughput, cost. The user may thus need to dynamically select one connection among those that are available, according to its preferences. This paper presents a survey of network interface selection in existing mobility and mutlihoming protocols to provide multihomed network mobility to <b>a</b> <b>cruising</b> <b>ship,</b> or to any vehicle (e. g., train, car, airplane, etc.) ...|$|R

5|$|Just a {{week after}} Hurricane Juan hit Nova Scotia, the Newfoundland and Labrador Emergency Measures Organization advised the general public to take {{appropriate}} actions for the anticipated effects of Hurricane Kate, including high winds and potentially up to 3in (80mm) of rain. Such actions include securing loose objects, cleaning debris from storm drains, and owning appropriate hurricane supplies (such as a charged cell phone and batteries {{in the event of}} power outages). <b>A</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> scheduled to stop in St. John's bypassed Newfoundland to avoid the storm. The Newfoundland and Maritimes Weather Center issued a storm warning for Newfoundland, while the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued a hurricane-force wind warning. Due to the expected combination of moisture from Kate and a cold front, the Canadian Hurricane Centre also issued a heavy rainfall warning for southeastern Newfoundland. Offshore, waves were expected to reach 33feet (10m), while marine wind warnings were issued as well.|$|E
5|$|In March 1997, NSB {{announced}} that they had plans to privatize {{the operations of the}} line from 1998. The responsibility for setting the schedule, selling tickets and marketing was transferred to Flåm Utvikling, a newly established company that NSB owned 49 percent of, and Aurland Ressursutvikling 51 percent. The latter was owned by Aurland Municipality, the Industrial Development Corporation of Norway and Aurland Sparebank, a local bank. Flåm Utvikling also took over responsibility for other tourism-related activities in Flåm, such as port facilities. NSB would still operate the trains, and Flåm Utvikling would pay NSB the cost of running the trains, but keep the profits from the ticket sales. The Norwegian National Rail Administration, which had been established in 1996 and had taken over the responsibility for infrastructure, retained ownership of the line itself. Flåm Utvikling also started building <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> terminal at Flåm, so tourists could walk ashore and directly to the trains.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{the player}} can find {{rustling}} patches {{of grass and}} rippling water, where they can encounter either a rare Pokémon, a Pokémon {{more common in the}} opposite game version, or the highest evolutionary form of a Pokémon whose lower forms can normally be found in the area. This {{is the only way to}} capture Pokémon such as Audino, Emolga, and Alomomola. Also, dust clouds in caves and the shadows of flying Pokémon on certain bridges can be entered to either find a rare item or encounter Drilbur, Excadrill, Ducklett, or Swanna, none of which can be found in the wild otherwise. Occasionally, when throwing a Poké Ball, the capture rate is highly increased, triggered by a random event. There are also new side-games and sidequests: the player can compete in Pokémon Musicals, a side-game similar to the Pokémon Contests of previous games; the Battle Subway, similar to the Battle Towers and Battle Frontiers of previous games; and on the Royal Unova, <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> that the player can ride and fight Trainers aboard to win otherwise rare items.|$|E

5|$|Though Virginia Beach and Williamsburg have {{traditionally}} been the centers of tourism for the region, the rebirth of downtown Norfolk {{and the construction of}} <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>ship</b> pier at the foot of Nauticus in downtown has driven tourism to become an increasingly important part of the city's economy. The number of cruise ship passengers who visited Norfolk increased from 50,000 in 2003, to 107,000 in 2004 and 2005. Also in April 2007, the city completed construction on a $36 million state-of-the-art cruise ship terminal alongside the pier. Partly due to this construction, passenger counts dropped to 70,000 in 2006, but is expected to rebound to 90,000 in 2007, and higher in later years. Unlike most cruise ship terminals which are located in industrial areas, the downtown location of Norfolk's terminal has received favorable reviews from both tourists and the cruise lines who enjoy its proximity to the city's hotels, restaurants, shopping, and cultural amenities.|$|E
5|$|Saint John in the United States Virgin Islands {{reported}} over 15inches (380mm) {{of rainfall}} {{in association with}} Tropical Storm Klaus. Both Saint Thomas and Saint Croix received around 10inches (250mm), while rainfall in the British Virgin Islands remained below 10inches (250mm). Tropical Storm Klaus caused severe flooding and extensive damage throughout the U.S. Virgin Islands. Strong southwesterly winds resulted in gale force winds and rough seas along the southwestern portions of the Leeward Islands. The rough waves caused considerable damage to marine interests in the area. In Anguilla, three ships were wrecked. 1mile (1.6km) off of Saint Martin, the rough seas wrecked <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>ship.</b> The 60 passengers and 23 crew members swam safely to shore, though one person was hospitalized. Rough seas also damaged local coral reefs. 10,000people were affected {{on the island of}} Dominica. There, the storm caused $2million (1984 USD, $3.9million 2006USD) in damage and resulted in two fatalities. In Antigua, strong waves from the hurricane produced severe beach erosion, which endangered a highway behind an eroded beach. Beach erosion was reported in nearby Barbuda, as well. The British Virgin Islands sustained moderate damage totaling to $152million (1984USD, $315million 2008USD). St. Kitts and Nevis also saw much Leeward coastal damage resulting from the storm, the worst impact being the destruction of the Sandy Point town port in Saint Kitts.|$|E
