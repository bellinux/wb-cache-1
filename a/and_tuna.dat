40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the lagoon of Mischief Reef, South China Sea to test the feasibility of feeding and rearing wild caught yellowfin <b>tuna</b> Thunnus albacares <b>and</b> skipjack <b>tuna</b> Katsuwonus pelamis juveniles in small, deep sea-water, cages. Fish started active feeding four days after transfer to the rearing cage. Initial feeding depth between yellowfin <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> skipjack <b>tuna</b> was not significantly different (P > 0. 05). The initial feeding depth for yellowfin tuna juveniles was 2. 97 ± 1. 09 m, <b>and</b> skipjack <b>tuna</b> fed at 2. 95 ± 0. 77 m. After the 30 day rearing experiment specific growth rates of yellowfin <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> skipjack <b>tuna</b> were: 0. 25 ± 0. 02 %/day and 0. 32 ± 0. 03 %/day, respectively; survival rate of yellowfin tuna was 100 %, and the survival rate of skipjack tuna was 82. 6 %.

5|$|Most {{fish are}} ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), {{allowing}} their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, {{though some of}} the large active swimmers like white shark <b>and</b> <b>tuna</b> can hold a higher core temperature. Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish). With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of species are surface feeders, obtaining food {{that has been}} pushed to the surface by other predators or currents, or have floated in death. Among the surface feeders some, principally the gadfly petrels, can obtain food by dipping from flight, {{while most of the}} rest feed while sitting on the water. These surface feeders are dependent on their prey being close to the surface, and for this reason procellariids are often found in association with other predators or oceanic convergences. Studies have shown strong associations between many different kinds of seabirds, including wedge-tailed shearwaters, and dolphins <b>and</b> <b>tuna,</b> which push shoaling fish up towards the surface.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, a drift gillnet fishery for {{the common}} {{thresher}} developed in southern California in 1977, beginning with 10 vessels experimenting with a larger-sized mesh. Within two years the fleet had increased to 40 vessels, and the fishery peaked in 1982 when 228 vessels landed 1,091 metric tons. The common thresher population rapidly collapsed from overfishing, with landings decreasing to less than 300 metric tons a year by the late 1980s and larger size classes disappearing from the population. Common threshers are still taken commercially in the United States, with about 85% coming from the Pacific and 15% from the Atlantic. The largest catches remain from the California-Oregon gillnet fishery, which had shifted its focus to the more valuable swordfish (Xiphius gladius) but still take threshers as bycatch. Small numbers of Pacific threshers are also taken by harpoons, small-mesh driftnets, and longlines. In the Atlantic, threshers are primarily taken on longlines meant for swordfish <b>and</b> <b>tuna.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gannets, boobies, tropicbirds, some terns {{and brown}} {{pelicans}} all engage in plunge diving, taking fast moving prey by diving {{into the water}} from flight. Plunge diving allows birds to use the energy from {{the momentum of the}} dive to combat natural buoyancy (caused by air trapped in plumage), and thus uses less energy than the dedicated pursuit divers, allowing them to utilise more widely distributed food resources, for example, in impoverished tropical seas. In general, this is the most specialised method of hunting employed by seabirds; other non-specialists (such as gulls and skuas) may employ it but do so with less skill and from lower heights. In brown pelicans the skills of plunge diving take several years to fully develop—once mature, they can dive from 20m (70ft) above the water's surface, shifting the body before impact to avoid injury. It has been suggested that plunge divers are restricted in their hunting grounds to clear waters that afford a view of their prey from the air, and while they are the dominant guild in the tropics, the link between plunge diving and water clarity is inconclusive. Some plunge divers (as well as some surface feeders) are dependent on dolphins <b>and</b> <b>tuna</b> to push shoaling fish up towards the surface.|$|E

40|$|A marked {{evolutionary}} convergence {{has been}} demonstrated for the lamnid sharks (order Lamniformes; family Lamnidae) <b>and</b> <b>tunas</b> (order Perciformes; family Scombridae) in specializations related to an increased capacity for sustained, aerobic locomotion (i. e. high-performance swimming; Bernal et al., 2001 a). The sustained swimming of all fishes is powered by the red myotomal muscle (RM; Bone, 1978 a) and, in most species, RM occurs along the posterior lateral edges {{of the body and}} is the dominant fiber type in that region [approximately 75 – 85 % fork length (FL) ] subject to maximal body bending during caudal thrust production (Greer-Walker and Pull, 1975).

40|$|Fishes with internalized and {{endothermic}} red muscles (i. e. <b>tunas</b> <b>and</b> lamnid sharks) {{are known}} for a stiff-bodied form of undulatory swimming, based on unique muscle–tendon architecture that limits lateral undulation to the tail region even though the red muscle is shifted anteriorly. A strong convergence between lamnid sharks <b>and</b> <b>tunas</b> in these features suggests that thunniform swimming might be evolutionarily tied to this specialization of red muscle, but recent observations on the common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) do not support this view. Here, we review the fundamental features of the locomotor systems in lamnids <b>and</b> <b>tunas,</b> <b>and</b> present data on in vivo muscle function and swimming mechanics in thresher sharks. These {{results suggest that the}} presence of endothermic and internalized red muscles alone in a fish does not predict or constrain the swimming mode to be thunniform and, indeed, that the benefits of this type of muscle may vary greatly as a consequence of body size...|$|R

40|$|Summer ichthyoplankton {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} in surface waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico from 2007 to 2010 to characterize distribution <b>and</b> abundance of <b>tuna</b> larvae. The assemblage of tuna larvae was comprised of four genera: Thunnus, Auxis, Euthynnus, <b>and</b> Katsuwonus. True <b>tunas</b> (genus Thunnus) were the most abundant, and four species were detected; Atlantic bluefin tuna (T. thynnus), yellowfin tuna (T. albacares), bigeye <b>tuna</b> (T. obesus), <b>and</b> blackfin <b>tuna</b> (T. atlanticus). Intra- and inter-annual variability in distribution <b>and</b> abundance of <b>tuna</b> larvae were observed with higher densities in 2008 and 2009 followed by a decline in abundance in 2010. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and generalized additive models (GAM) based on presence/absence and density were developed to {{examine the impact of}} mesoscale features on distribution and abundance on true <b>tuna</b> larvae. Distribution <b>and</b> abundance of true tuna larvae in surface waters were influenced by physicochemical conditions of the water mass, notably sea surface temperature and salinity. Distinct species-specific habitat preferences, were observed and the location of mesoscale oceanographic features influenced larval abundance with higher densities of blackfin <b>tuna,</b> yellowfin <b>tuna,</b> <b>and</b> bigeye <b>tuna</b> associated with convergent zones near the margin of the Loop Current (LC) and other anticyclonic regions (warm core); bluefin tuna was observed in higher densities near cyclonic regions (cold core). Finally, habitat suitability maps were developed based on GAMs and environmental conditions to predict the spatial coverage of suitable habitat of blackfin <b>tuna</b> (2011 <b>and</b> 2015) <b>and</b> yellowfin <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> bigeye <b>tuna</b> during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (2010). Habitat suitability maps revealed that the amount of highly suitable habitat of blackfin tuna larvae varied between months (June 6 %, July 51 %); however, in both months larvae were distributed in similar locations along the continental slope and at the margin of the LC in the northern GoM. Similarly, the extent of highly suitable habitat for yellowfin <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> bigeye <b>tuna</b> varied between June and July. A larger percentage of highly suitable habitat of bigeye tuna was exposed to surface oil (23 - 34 %) compared to yellowfin tuna (4 - 26 %), indicating that the oil spill might have impacted the two species differently...|$|R
