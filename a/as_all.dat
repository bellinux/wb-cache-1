5|$|Airship Industries {{managed a}} major {{marketing}} coup with {{the inclusion of}} their Skyship 500 series blimp in the film. At the time Airship Industries were producing a fleet of blimps which were recognisable over many capitals of the world offering tours, or advertising sponsorship deals. <b>As</b> <b>all</b> Bond films have included the most current technology, this included the lighter than air interest.|$|E

5|$|As may be {{observed}} in the table below, the main limiting factor in the precision of the Avogadro constant is the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constant, <b>as</b> <b>all</b> the other constants that contribute to the calculation are known more precisely.|$|E
5|$|As the American colonies went to war, {{they needed}} soldiers, supplies, {{and lots of}} them. Soldiers needed uniforms and, <b>as</b> <b>all</b> {{shipping}} into the colonies had ceased, wool became an integral commodity to the war effort. During the Revolution the consumption of mutton ceased almost entirely in many areas, and in Virginia it became illegal to consume except in cases of extreme necessity.|$|E

5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{parallel}} line, the Hoved Line running {{all the way from}} Oslo S to Eidsvoll, some trains can choose to use this line instead. This is primarily done by some commuter trains, as well <b>as</b> <b>all</b> freight trains. The only exception to this are trains hauling jet fuel to the airport, who have to use the Gardermoen Line from Kløfta. This service is provided by CargoNet.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate preservice elementary school teachers’ (PSTs’) responses to written standard place-value-operation tasks (addition and subtraction). Previous research established that PSTs can often perform but not explain algorithms and provided a four-category framework for PSTs’ conceptions, two correct and two incorrect. Previous findings are replicated for PSTs toward the end of their college careers, and two conceptions are further analyzed to yield three categories of incorrect views of regrouped digits: (a) consistently <b>as</b> 1 value (<b>all</b> <b>as</b> 1 or <b>all</b> <b>as</b> 10), (b) consistently within but not across contexts (i. e., <b>all</b> <b>as</b> 10 in addition but <b>all</b> <b>as</b> 1 in subtraction), and (c) inconsistently (depending on the task) ...|$|R

5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time <b>as</b> <b>all</b> being infinitely divisible.

5|$|Georgia's jury {{votes in}} the Grand Final were all {{declared}} invalid, <b>as</b> <b>all</b> the jury members had voted exactly the same from 3 points up to 12 points.
