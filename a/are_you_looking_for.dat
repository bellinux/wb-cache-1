2500|$|Petra {{also used}} the record to defuse the backmasking controversy, which had begun to spread into Christian music, as {{conservative}} church leaders accused Christian artists of hiding subliminal messages {{that could only be}} heard when records were played in reverse. Inserting a blatant piece of backmasking in the break between the title track and hard rocker [...] "Judas' Kiss," [...] the band's message was less than subtle. Played in reverse, the backmasked portion stated: [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> the devil for when you oughta be looking for the Lord?" [...] It was not the first – nor would it be the last – time Petra weighed in against critics of contemporary Christian music.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Christian {{rock group}} Petra {{included}} in their song [...] "Judas Kiss", from the 1982 album More Power to Ya, the message, [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> the devil for, when {{you ought to}} be looking for the Lord?" [...] Bloodhound Gang's 1996 controversy-begging track [...] "Lift Your Head Up High (And Blow Your Brains Out)" [...] mocked the Judas Priest controversy directly, and included the backmasked phrase [...] "Devil child, wake up and eat Chef Boyardee Beefaroni". The band Mindless Self Indulgence released a song titled [...] "Backmaskwarning!", which contains the forward lyrics [...] "Play that record backwards / Here's a message yo for the suckas / Play that record backwards / And go fuck yourself". The backwards messages in the song include, [...] "clean your room", [...] "do your homework", [...] "don't stay out too late", and [...] "eat your vegetables".|$|E

50|$|The {{study of}} visual {{attention}} provides an example. If your attention {{is drawn to}} a flower in a field, {{it may be because}} the color or shape of the flower are visually salient. The information that caused you to attend to the flower came to you in a bottom-up fashion—your attention was not contingent upon knowledge of the flower; the outside stimulus was sufficient on its own. Contrast this situation with one in which <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a flower. <b>You</b> have a representation of what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> When <b>you</b> see the object <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for,</b> it is salient.
