It is experienced as forgetfulness, mild confusion, and irritability. The first stage of {{hepatic encephalopathy}} is characterised by an inverted sleep-wake pattern (sleeping by day, being <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> <b>night).</b> The second stage is marked by lethargy and personality changes. The third stage is marked by worsened confusion. The fourth stage {{is marked by a}} progression to coma.|$|E
5|$|Oan, {{angered by}} the BBC's {{incorrect}} reporting of his demands the previous evening, contacted the police negotiators shortly after 06:00 and accused the authorities of deceiving him. He demanded to speak with an Arab ambassador, but the negotiator on duty claimed that talks were still being arranged by the Foreign Office. Recognising the delaying tactic, Oan told the negotiator that the British hostages {{would be the last}} to be released because of the British authorities' deceit. He added that a hostage would be killed unless Tony Crabb was brought back to the embassy. Crabb did not arrive at the embassy until 15:30, nearly ten hours after Oan demanded his presence, to the frustration of both Oan and Sim Harris. Oan then relayed another statement to Crabb via Mustapha Karkouti, a journalist also being held hostage in the embassy. The police guaranteed that the statement would be broadcast on the BBC's next news bulletin, in exchange for the release of two hostages. The hostages decided amongst themselves that the two to be released would be Hiyech Kanji and Ali-Guil Ghanzafar; the latter was apparently released {{for no other reason than}} his loud snoring, which kept the other hostages <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E

Shortly afterwards, MacKenzie published further entirely false allegations that the singer had had the voiceboxes of his guard dogs removed because their barking kept him <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> MacKenzie confirmed their inaccuracy shortly after publication by sending a reporter to the singer's house, who quickly discovered that all of his guard dogs were quite capable of barking.|$|E

I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and I remember the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} {{prescribed}} Benzedrine, the wonder drug of the 1950s. Regarded {{then as a}} harmless stimulant, {{it belongs to the}} family of drugs called amphetamines, and at that time they were prescribed and used in a very casual way. Among the side effects of Benzedrine are insomnia, restlessness, and mood swings, all of which Eden suffered during the Suez Crisis; indeed, earlier in his premiership he complained of being kept <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> by the sound of motor scooters. Eden's drug use is now commonly agreed to {{have been a part of}} the reason for his bad judgment while Prime Minister.|$|E

25|$|On November 24, 1966 (Thanksgiving Day), Hughes {{arrived in}} Las Vegas by {{railroad}} car {{and moved into}} the Desert Inn. Because he refused to leave the hotel and to avoid further conflicts with the owners, Hughes bought the Desert Inn in early 1967. The hotel's eighth floor became the nerve center of Hughes' empire and the ninth-floor penthouse became his personal residence. Between 1966 and 1968, he bought several other hotel-casinos, including the Castaways, New Frontier, the Landmark Hotel and Casino, and the Sands. He bought the small Silver Slipper casino {{for the sole purpose}} of moving its trademark neon silver slipper.

25|$|Medical {{research}} {{on the effects of}} excessive light on the human body suggests that a variety of adverse health effects may be caused by light pollution or excessive light exposure, and some lighting design textbooks use human health as an explicit criterion for proper interior lighting. Health effects of over-illumination or improper spectral composition of light may include: increased headache incidence, worker fatigue, medically defined stress, decrease in sexual function and increase in anxiety. Likewise, animal models have been studied demonstrating unavoidable light to produce adverse effect on mood and anxiety. For those who need to be <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> light at night also has an acute effect on alertness and mood.|$|E
25|$|Nocturnal {{animals have}} higher body temperatures, greater activity, rising serotonin, and {{diminishing}} cortisol during the night—the inverse of diurnal animals. Nocturnal and diurnal animals both have increased electrical {{activity in the}} suprachiasmatic nucleus, and corresponding secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland, at night. Nocturnal mammals, which tend to stay <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> have higher melatonin at night just like diurnal mammals do. And, although removing the pineal gland in many animals abolishes melatonin rhythms, it does not stop circadian rhythms altogether—though it may alter them and weaken their responsiveness to light cues. Cortisol levels in diurnal animals typically rise throughout the night, peak in the awakening hours, and diminish during the day. In diurnal animals, sleepiness increases during the night.|$|E

Four Weddings and a Funeral director Mike Newell was approached but rejected it to work on Pushing Tin. He said that in commercial terms {{he had made the}} wrong decision, but did not regret it. The producer, Duncan Kenworthy, then turned to Roger Michell, saying that [...] "Finding someone as good as Roger, was just like finding the right actor to play each role. Roger shone out." ...|$|E

He was loyal, honest; just a solid-gold individual. He didn't have a malicious {{bone in his}} body". Garland often slept {{during the day and}} stayed <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> leading his peers to {{think of him as a}} vampire. Before becoming a senior, he led the Pride to sixth place at the under-17 national AAU tournament in Orlando, Florida. The team finished with an 8–1 record due largely to Garland's contributions.|$|E
500|$|After {{the start}} of his {{management}} career, Epstein started taking stimulants, usually Preludin, which did not require a prescription at the time. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr had also taken it since their days in Hamburg. Epstein explained his use of the drug as the only means of staying <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> during numerous concert tours. In 1964, Peter Brown suspected that Epstein was taking too many pills, as he would often cough at parties, which Brown realised was Epstein's way of secretly putting pills into his mouth without anyone noticing. McCartney often met Epstein at late night clubs in London, and remembered that Epstein would often grind his jaws (possibly due to bruxism), once saying to him, [...] "Ugghhh, the pills". Epstein also developed dependencies on the drug carbromal, a barbiturate-like sedative/hypnotic drug.|$|E

500|$|Discussing his beliefs, in 2009 Ebert {{wrote that}} he did not [...] "want to provide a {{category}} for people to apply to [...] " [...] because he [...] "would not want [...] convictions reduced to a word", and stated, [...] "I have never said, although readers have freely informed me I am an atheist, an agnostic, {{or at the very least}} a secular humanist– which I am". In the same blog entry, he also said [...] "I am not a believer, not an atheist, not an agnostic. I am still <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> asking how? I am more content with the question than I would be with an answer." [...] In March 2013, he wrote: [...] "I support freedom of choice. My choice is to not support abortion, except in cases of a clear-cut choice between the lives of the mother and child. A child conceived through incest or rape is innocent and deserves the right to be born."

2500|$|Bruxism can be {{subdivided}} into two types based upon when the parafunctional activity occurs – during sleep ("sleep bruxism"), or while awake ("awake bruxism"). This {{is the most}} widely used classification since sleep bruxism generally has different causes to awake bruxism, although the effects on the condition on the teeth may be the same. The treatment is also often dependent upon whether the bruxism happens during sleep or while awake, e.g., an occlusal splint worn during sleep in a person who only bruxes when awake will probably have no benefit. Some have even suggested that sleep bruxism is an entirely different disorder and is not associated with awake bruxism. Awake bruxism is sometimes abbreviated to AB, and is also termed [...] "diurnal bruxism", DB, or [...] "daytime bruxing". Sleep bruxism is sometimes abbreviated to SB, and is also termed [...] "sleep-related bruxism", [...] "nocturnal bruxism", or [...] "nocturnal tooth grinding". According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders revised edition (ICSD-R), the term [...] "sleep bruxism" [...] is the most appropriate since this type occurs during sleep specifically rather than being associated with a particular time of day, i.e., if a person with sleep bruxism were to sleep during the day and stay <b>awake</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> then the condition would not occur during the night but during the day. The ICDS-R defined sleep bruxism as [...] "a stereotyped movement disorder characterized by grinding or clenching of the teeth during sleep", classifying it as a parasomnia. The second edition (ICSD-2) however reclassified bruxism to a [...] "sleep related movement disorder" [...] rather than a parasomnia.|$|E
