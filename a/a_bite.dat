5|$|Slow lorises {{can produce}} a {{secretion}} on their brachial gland (a gland on their arm) which when mixed with their saliva creates a volatile, noxious toxin that can be, if necessary, delivered in <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> to an aggressor. <b>A</b> <b>bite</b> causes a painful swelling and is slow to heal; the toxin is mild and not typically fatal, although an anaphylactic reaction is possible.|$|E
5|$|Double-dipping {{involves}} taking <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> of a {{chip and}} then re-dipping {{it into a}} dip, which some people disapprove, while others are indifferent. Double-dipping transfers bacteria from a person's mouth into a dip, which can then be transferred to other consumer's mouths.|$|E

5|$|According {{to another}} urban legend, daddy long legs (Pholcidae) have potent venom, but their fangs are {{too short to}} deliver the poison. This myth might have arisen due to its {{similarity}} in appearance with the Brown recluse spider. In a 2004 episode of Discovery Channel's MythBusters, it was shown that host Adam Savage survived <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> from the spider.|$|E
5|$|Around one {{in three}} {{subjects}} develops systemic symptoms; {{after a number of}} hours, or rarely, delayed for more than 24 hours. Symptoms typically include nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, agitation, headache, generalised sweating and hypertension. Other non-specific systemic effects such as malaise and lethargy are also common. Rarely, other effects are reported such as neurological manifestations, fever and priapism (uncontrolled erection of the penis). Severe pain usually persists for over 24 hours after being bitten. Symptoms of envenomation may linger for weeks or even months. Rare complications include localised skin infection, seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, or respiratory failure. Children, the elderly, or those with serious medical conditions are at much higher risk of severe effects resulting from <b>a</b> <b>bite.</b> Infants have died within hours of <b>a</b> <b>bite,</b> but adult fatalities have taken up to 30 days.|$|E
5|$|Envenomation from a redback spider bite {{produces}} a syndrome known as latrodectism. A {{small but significant}} percentage of people bitten develop significant pain or systemic symptoms. The diagnosis is made from the clinical condition, often based on the victim being aware of <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> and ideally with identification of the spider. Laboratory tests are rarely needed {{and there is no}} specific test for the venom or latrodectism.|$|E

5|$|PVSJ 407, a Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis, had a pit in a skull bone {{attributed}} by Paul Sereno and Novas to <b>a</b> <b>bite.</b> Two additional pits {{occurred on}} the splenial. The areas around these pits are swollen and porous, suggesting the wounds were afflicted by a short-lived non-lethal infection. Because of the size and angles of the wound, {{it is likely that}} they were obtained in a fight with another Herrerasaurus.|$|E
5|$|Rolling {{a person}} with an active tonic-clonic seizure onto their side and into the {{recovery}} position helps prevent fluids from getting into the lungs. Putting fingers, <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> block or tongue depressor in the mouth is not recommended as it might make the person vomit or result in the rescuer being bitten. Efforts {{should be taken to}} prevent further self-injury. Spinal precautions are generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{support the}} safety of antivenom, with around a 5% chance of an acute reaction, 1–2% of {{anaphylaxis}} and 10% chance of a delayed reaction due to serum sickness. Nevertheless, {{it is recommended that}} an injection of adrenaline be ready and available in case it is needed to treat a severe anaphylactic reaction, and also that the antivenom from the vial be administered diluted in a 100 ml bag of intravenous solution for infusion over 30 minutes. While it is rare that patients report symptoms of envenomation lasting weeks or months following <b>a</b> <b>bite,</b> there are case reports from the 1990s in which antivenom was reported to be effective in the relief of chronic symptoms when administered weeks or months after <b>a</b> <b>bite,</b> however, {{in the vast majority of}} cases, it is administered within 24 hours.|$|E
5000|$|The phrase {{was coined}} by Alfred Harmsworth (1865-1922), a British {{newspaper}} magnate, {{but is also}} attributed to New York Sun editor John B.

5|$|The single-origin {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the mechanism of evolution in most cases has been gene duplication followed by natural selection for adaptive traits. Some of the various adaptations produced by this process include venom more toxic to specific prey in several lineages, proteins that pre-digest prey, and a method to track down prey after <b>a</b> <b>bite.</b> These various adaptations of venom have also led to considerable debate about the definition of venom and venomous snakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{specimen}} {{had serious}} puncture wounds {{on the front}} of the skull, indicating that it had been preyed upon by a large carnivore. One puncture wound was on the right side of the braincase and may have been the fatal blow. There was also <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> mark on the frontal trigon.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>bite</b> from a {{black mamba}} causes initial {{neurological}} and neuromuscular symptoms that may commonly include headache and a metallic taste in the mouth, which may {{be accompanied by a}} triad of paresthesias, profuse perspiration and salivation. Other symptoms may include ptosis and gradual bulbar palsy. Localised pain or numbness around the bite site is common but not typically severe; therefore, application of a tourniquet proximal to the bite site is feasible and may assist in slowing the onset of prominent neurotoxicity. Without appropriate treatment, symptoms typically progress to more severe reactions such as tachydysrhythmias and neurogenic shock, leading to death by asphyxiation, cardiovascular collapse, or respiratory failure.|$|E

While employed at PT's Show Club she suffered injury from <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> by a patron at the facility who was later charged with assault by police. She was transported to the hospital where she received treatment for puncture wounds.|$|E
5|$|Relatively speaking, bites {{from this}} species are not highly dangerous. In Britain {{there have been}} only 14 known {{fatalities}} since 1876—the last a 5-year-old child in 1975—and one near fatal bite of a 39-year-old woman in Essex in 1998. An 82-year-old woman died following <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> in Germany in 2004, although {{it is not clear whether}} her death was due to the effect of the venom. Even so, professional medical help should always be sought as soon as possible after any bite. Very occasionally bites can be life-threatening, particularly in small children, while adults may experience discomfort and disability long after the bite. The length of recovery varies, but may take up to a year.|$|E

5|$|The {{behavior}} of double-dipping involves consuming chips and dip, taking <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> of the chip, and then re-dipping {{it into a}} dip. In March 2013, Tostitos, a U.S. brand of tortilla chips and dips, hired the Ketchum communications agency to perform a survey concerning double dipping that polled over 1,000 Americans. The survey found that 46% of male participants double-dip at a party, compared to 32% of females. 54% stated {{that they would not}} consume dip after seeing another person double-dip, and 22% stated that they did not care. 25% stated that they would verbally object to a person caught double-dipping.|$|E
5|$|The {{brown bear}} and both species of black bears {{sometimes}} take large ungulates, such as deer and bovids, mostly {{the young and}} weak. These animals may be taken by a short rush and ambush, though hiding young may be stiffed out and pounced on. The polar bear mainly preys on seals, stalking them from the ice or breaking into their dens. They primarily eat the highly digestible blubber. Large mammalian prey is typically killed by <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> to the head or neck, or (in the case of young) simply pinned down and mauled. Predatory behaviour in bears is typically taught to the young by the mother.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel forages undercover, {{to avoid}} being seen by foxes and birds of prey. It is adapted for {{pursuing}} its prey down tunnels, though it may also bolt prey from a burrow and kill it in the open. The least weasel kills small prey, such as voles, with <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> to the occipital region of the skull or the neck, dislocating the cervical vertebrae. Large prey typically dies of blood loss or circulatory shock. When food is abundant, {{only a small portion}} of the prey is eaten, usually the brain. The average daily food intake is , which is equivalent to 30–35% of the animal's body weight.|$|E
