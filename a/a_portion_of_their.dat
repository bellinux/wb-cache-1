5|$|In West African cultures, {{women with}} long hair were highly valued. Long, thick hair {{was seen as a}} sign of health, strength, and {{capability}} to bear many children. In keeping with this general theme, women who were too young for marriage would shave <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads to signal so. This tradition, however, did not extend to every West African culture, as several valued shorter hair.|$|E
5|$|Merchants and peasant farmers paid {{property}} and poll taxes in coin cash and land taxes with <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> crop yield. Peasants obtained coinage by working as hired laborers for rich landowners, in businesses like breweries or by selling agricultural goods and homemade wares at urban markets. The Han government {{may have found}} collecting taxes in coin the easiest method because the transportation of taxed goods would have been unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} landowner's land tax paid in <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> crop yield, the poll tax and {{property}} taxes were paid in coin cash. The annual poll tax rate for adult {{men and women}} was 120 coins and 20 coins for minors. Merchants were required to pay {{a higher rate of}} 240 coins. The poll tax stimulated a money economy that necessitated the minting of over 28,000,000,000 coins from 118 BC to 5 AD, an average of 220,000,000 coins a year.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, the Allied powers {{established}} the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).

Nations may hold <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> reserves as deposits with the institution.

5|$|It was not {{uncommon}} for wealthy or powerful families to facilitate the construction of large temple complexes, usually by donating <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> family estate to a Buddhist sect. Often the land already contained buildings that could be re-purposed for religions use. The Fei (費) family {{of the town of}} Jinze, located just west of Shanghai, converted a mansion on their property into a Buddhist sutra-recitiation hall, and later built several other religious buildings around the hall. This spurred a boom in temple construction in the area, causing Jinze to become a major center of the White Lotus sect of Buddhism, which in turn spurred the construction of more temples and lead the town to become a significant location within the Song. The nearby town of Nanxiang gained prominence shortly {{after the fall of the}} Song in large part to the construction of temples and other religious buildings, which spanned the entire Song empire.|$|E
5|$|Ryan {{voted to}} extend {{unemployment}} insurance in 2002, 2008, and 2009, but has since voted against further extensions. In 2004 and 2005, Ryan pushed the Bush administration to propose {{the privatization of}} Social Security. His proposal ultimately failed when it did not gain {{the support of the}} then-Republican presidential administration. In 2005, Ryan and Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire introduced the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act, also known as the Ryan-Sununu plan. The plan would have allowed employees to direct <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Federal Insurance Contributions Act payroll tax on their wages to a private account which invested in a stock portfolio managed by the Social Security Administration. Versions of the plan were included in Ryan's later budget proposals.|$|E
5|$|The 50 Greatest Players in National Basketball Association History (also {{referred}} to as NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team or NBA's Top 50) were chosen in 1996 to honor the fiftieth anniversary {{of the founding of}} the National Basketball Association (NBA). These fifty players were selected through a vote by a panel of media members, former players and coaches, and current and former general managers. In addition, the top ten head coaches and top ten single-season teams in NBA history were selected by media members as part of the celebration.

5|$|The Han Chancellor and King of Wei Cao Cao (155–220 AD) {{made the}} final {{significant}} attempt {{to limit the}} power of wealthy landowners. Cao Cao established government-managed agricultural colonies for landless commoners; in exchange for land and cheap equipment, the farmers paid <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> crop yield. In the 120s BC, Emperor Wu had attempted to establish agricultural colonies in the northwestern frontier of the newly conquered Hexi Corridor (in modern Gansu). 600,000 new settlers farmed on these state lands using seeds, draft animals and equipment loaned by the government. An imperial edict in 85 AD ordered the local governments of commanderies and subordinate kingdoms to resettle landless peasants onto state-owned lands, {{where they would be}} paid wages, provided with crop seeds, loaned farming tools and exempted from rent payments for five years and poll taxes for three years. The edict also allowed peasants to return to their native counties at any time. Subsequent governments of the Three Kingdoms established agricultural colonies on these models.|$|E
5|$|In Miami, {{damage was}} minimal, limited to broken windows and awnings. In Hollywood and Fort Lauderdale, windows and roofs were damaged, {{although}} damage was still fairly minor. Numerous {{power lines and}} telephone wires were downed in the latter. Northward, from Pompano Beach to Jupiter, buildings suffered serious damage from the heavy winds and 10ft (3m) storm surge. Nearly all small frame houses were destroyed in Deerfield Beach, while several citizens estimated that at least 50% of homes were demolished. The town's post office, depot, and an entire business block were also destroyed. An eight-year-old boy drowned in a ditch near where his family sought refuge. In Boca Raton, two garages and several houses were destroyed. At the Cloister Inn, windows were shattered and the roof was damaged; across the street, 32freight cars belonging to a train along the Florida East Coast Railway were tossed by the wind into a nearby ditch. A short distance to the north, a warehouse was flattened. A building occupied by a restaurant and a store was flattened. In Delray Beach, four churches suffered severe damage and the Alta Repp and Seacrest hotels both lost <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> roof. The police reported three deaths within the city. In Delray Beach and Lantana, all houses and the railroad station were badly damaged. In Boynton Beach, about 75% of businesses suffered complete destruction. Fifteen people were injured by a roof collapse while taking refuge in the auditorium of a high school.|$|E
5|$|Similar to Capcom's various Street Fighter titles, X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a 2D {{fighting}} game {{in which}} players control various characters to engage in one-on-one combat, attempting to knock out the opponent by depleting their health. It is the first formal installment in the Marvel vs. Capcom series and features dual-character selection and tag team battles. Instead of the typical best-of-three round format, matches consist of a single round. Players select two characters {{at the beginning of}} a match, each sporting their own life gauge. Players control one character at a time, while the other awaits off-screen. The starting character can tag in the off-screen character at any time during the fight. The dormant character will also slowly recover <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> vitality while the current character is fighting. If one character loses all of their vitality, then the tag partner will automatically come into play. The match continues until both characters on either team are defeated. If the timer runs out before either team is knocked out, then the player with the most remaining health is declared the winner.|$|E
