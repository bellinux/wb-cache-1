40|$|Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) has an {{essential}} role in the expansion and function of CD 4 + regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs reduce tissue damage by limiting the immune response following infection and regulate autoreactive CD 4 + effector T cells (Teffs) to prevent autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes (T 1 D). Genetic susceptibility to T 1 D causes alterations in the IL- 2 pathway, a finding that supports Tregs as a cellular therapeutic target. <b>Aldesleukin</b> (Proleukin; recombinant human IL- 2), which is administered at high doses to activate the immune system in cancer immunotherapy, is now being repositioned to treat inflammatory and autoimmune disorders at lower doses by targeting Tregs. To define the <b>aldesleukin</b> dose response for Tregs and to find doses that increase Tregs physiologically for treatment of T 1 D, a statistical and systematic approach was taken by analysing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single doses of subcutaneous <b>aldesleukin</b> in the Adaptive Study of IL- 2 Dose on Regulatory T Cells in Type 1 Diabetes (DILT 1 D), a single centre, non-randomised, open label, adaptive dose-finding trial with 40 adult participants with recently diagnosed T 1 D. The primary endpoint was the maximum percentage increase in Tregs (defined as CD 3 +CD 4 +CD 25 highCD 127 low) from the baseline frequency in each participant measured over the 7 d following treatment. There was an initial learning phase with five pairs of participants, each pair receiving one of five pre-assigned single doses from 0. 04 × 106 to 1. 5 × 106 IU/m 2, in order to model the dose-response curve. Results from each participant were then incorporated into interim statistical modelling to target the two doses most likely to induce 10 % and 20 % increases in Treg frequencies. Primary analysis of the evaluable population (n = 39) found that the optimal doses of <b>aldesleukin</b> to induce 10 % and 20 % increases in Tregs were 0. 101 × 106 IU/m 2 (standard error [SE] = 0. 078, 95 % CI = - 0. 052, 0. 254) and 0. 497 × 106 IU/m 2 (SE = 0. 092, 95 % CI = 0. 316, 0. 678), respectively. On analysis of secondary outcomes, using a highly sensitive IL- 2 assay, the observed plasma concentrations of the drug at 90 min exceeded the hypothetical Treg-specific therapeutic window determined in vitro (0. 015 - 0. 24 IU/ml), even at the lowest doses (0. 040 × 106 and 0. 045 × 106 IU/m 2) administered. A rapid decrease in Treg frequency in the circulation was observed at 90 min and at day 1, which was dose dependent (mean decrease 11. 6 %, SE = 2. 3 %, range 10. 0 %- 48. 2 %, n = 37), rebounding at day 2 and increasing to frequencies above baseline over 7 d. Teffs, natural killer cells, and eosinophils also responded, with their frequencies rapidly and dose-dependently decreased in the blood, then returning to, or exceeding, pretreatment levels. Furthermore, there was a dose-dependent down modulation of one of the two signalling subunits of the IL- 2 receptor, the β chain (CD 122) (mean decrease = 58. 0 %, SE = 2. 8 %, range 9. 8 %- 85. 5 %, n = 33), on Tregs and a reduction in their sensitivity to <b>aldesleukin</b> at 90 min and day 1 and 2 post-treatment.

The immunomodulatory effects of this critical cytokine have been instrumental in the development of immunotherapy for melanoma and other cancers. However, with the advent of new therapies, its use as a front-line agent has come into question. Nonetheless, there is still a role for interleukin- 2 as monotherapy, as well as in combination with other agents and in clinical trials. In this article, we review preclinical and clinical data regarding interleukin- 2, its pharmacology and mechanism of action, its toxicity profile, and its use in ongoing and planned clinical trials.

40|$|Background: In current practice, {{immunotherapy}} {{has been}} established as an adjuvant rescue therapy for cervical cancer treatment after standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with tumor recurrence. Carcinoma of the cervix is a relatively chemotherapy-resistant disease. Patients with recurrent cervical cancer have significantly reduced life expectancy, and fewer than 20 % of patients survive for 1  year. Therefore, we tried using CCRT after priming and booster immunomodulatory therapy [i. e., immunochemoradiotherapy, (ICRT) ]. Case reports: In the first report, a 34 year-old female diagnosed with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIA cervical cancer with pathological proof of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma was treated with radical surgery. Two years later, she experienced progressive weakness and numbness in her right leg. Computed tomography showed a mass of 8  cm ×  7  cm in her right lower pelvis and presacral area with encasement of the right middle ureter. In addition, right hydronephrosis and a metastatic lymph node were suspected in the right iliac vessels. She received standard CCRT with “add on” immunomodulatory agents as a radiosensitizer to augment ICRT. The priming immunomodulatory agents included picibanil [O (i. e., OK- 432) ], mixed Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline, London, England) or Gardasil (Merck and Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA) viral-like particle vaccine (V) on day 1, and <b>aldesleukin</b> [A (i. e., interleukin- 2) ] on Day 2. She also started concurrent radiotherapy and palcitaxol (80  mg/m 2) on Day 2 and boostered OVA (i. e., picibanil, viral-like particle vaccine, and <b>aldesleukin)</b> again on Day 4 and Day 5. After the ICRT treatment, remarkable improvements occurred by lower sacral pain, regression of the pelvic tumor, and decreased squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) levels from 33. 8  ng/mL to normal. The second case report is a 66 -year-old female with FIGO stage IIA cervical adenocarcinoma. She underwent staging surgery, followed by CCRT. She first had a relapse on the supraclavicle node 2  years before receiving CCRT. A left axilla mass was noted 6  years before she started the priming and booster ICRT treatment. Both patients have been disease-free for > 5  years since receiving CCRT. Conclusion: We reported two patients with cervical cancer recurrence after conventional therapy. We combined CCRT and ICRT to augment the host cells' immunosurveillance and reach durable response more than 5  years mimic long-term progression-free survival.

40|$|Therapy with Proleukin ® (<b>aldesleukin)</b> {{should be}} {{restricted}} to patients with normal cardiac and pulmonary functions as defined by thallium stress testing and formal pulmonary function testing. Extreme caution {{should be used in}} patients with a normal thallium stress test and a normal pulmonary function test who have a history of cardiac or pulmonary disease. Proleukin should be administered in a hospital setting under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of anticancer agents. An intensive care facility and specialists skilled in cardiopulmonary or intensive care medicine must be available. Proleukin administration has been associated with capillary leak syndrome (CLS) which is characterized by a loss of vascular tone and extravasation of plasma proteins and fluid into the extravascular space. CLS results in hypotension and reduced organ perfusion which may be severe and can result in death. CLS may be associated with cardiac arrhythmias (supraventricular and ventricular), angina, myocardial infarction, respiratory insufficiency requiring intubation, gastrointestinal bleeding or infarction, renal insufficiency, edema, and mental status changes. Proleukin treatment is associated with impaired neutrophil function (reduced chemotaxis) and with an increased risk of disseminated infection, including sepsis and bacterial endocarditis. Consequently, preexisting bacterial infections should be adequately treated prior to initiation of Proleukin therapy. Patients with indwelling central lines are particularly at risk for infection with gram positive microorganisms. Antibiotic prophylaxis with oxacillin, nafcillin, ciprofloxacin, or vancomycin has been associated with a reduced incidence of staphylococcal infections. Proleukin administration should be withheld in patients developing moderate to severe lethargy or somnolence; continued administration may result in coma. ...|$|E
40|$|Rigors (chills or shivering) can occurafter {{patients}} receive general anes-thesia, amphotericin B, interleukin- 2 (<b>aldesleukin),</b> monoclonal antibodies, {{and blood}} products. 1 They {{are believed to}} occur from the thermoregulatory re-sponse to hypothermia or muscle hyper-activity with clonic or tonic patterns. 2 Rigors can lead to increased oxygen con-sumption, vasoconstriction, and in-creased vascular resistance, which can further compromise recovery. Several antineoplastic drugs can induce rigors. Failure to control this adverse effect may cause patients to abandon potentially life-extending or life-saving therapies. Several agents have been tried to prevent and treat this adverse event; however, meperidine remains {{the gold standard for}} many institutions, even though, to our knowledge, there have been no random-ized controlled trials reported that vali-date its use. Meperidine is a phenylpiperidine opi-oid agonist analgesic with anticholiner-gic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic ef-fects and is considered to be the most ef-fective agent available for the treatment and prevention of postanesthetic and am-photericin B–induced rigors. 3, 4 A study that investigated the thermoregulatory response to meperidine showed that it has a greater propensity for reducing the shivering threshold over the vasoconstriction threshold than do anes-thetics. 5 The more common adverse effects associated with meperidine therapy are nausea and vomiting; however, a more serious adverse effect can occur in patients with poor renal function. 6 Meperidine is metabolized into active and inactive metabolites in the liver and these metabolites are subject to renal elimination.

40|$|Purpose To {{review the}} {{treatment}} of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), {{including the use of}} new targeted therapies. Methods A search of MEDLINE (1966 to August 2008) and American Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting abstracts (2005 to May 2008) was preformed using the search terms bevacizumab, everolimus, interferon-alfa (IFN-α), interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), sorafenib, sunitinib, temsirolimus, and RCC. Articles most pertinent to {{the treatment of}} metastatic RCC are reviewed. Results The treatment of metastatic RCC has undergone a paradigm shift over the past 5 years from biologic response modifiers to new targeted therapies. Historically, response rates for the biological response modifiers, <b>aldesleukin</b> (IL- 2), and IFN-α were approximately 15 %. Recently, three targeted agents, sorafenib, sunitinib, and temsirolimus have been approved for the treatment of RCC. Additionally, bevacizumab has been investigated and shown to increase progression free survival in RCC. IL- 2 remains the only agent to induce complete, durable remissions; however, many patients are not eligible for this therapy. Newer agents (sorafenib, sunitinib, and temsirolimus) have shown to be superior to IFN-α or placebo and bevacizumab combined with IFN-α has shown activity when compared to IFN-α alone. Unlike IL- 2, the greatest benefit obtained with targeted therapies is in achieving stable disease (SD). Despite their benefit, targeted therapies have never been compared with each other in clinical trials and choosing the most appropriate agent remains challenging. To date, the optimal sequence or combination of treatments has not been defined; however, everolimus has recently demonstrated activity in patients progressing on targeted therapy. Conclusions IL- 2 remains the most active regimen in inducing complete responses; however, its use is accompanied by substantial morbidity and is limited to those with a good performance status. Targeted therapies are also efficacious in the treatment of RCC, with the major benefit being induction of SD. Future research will better define the sequencing of therapies, as well as, explore the activity of novel combination regimens...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{infection}} of a participant with norovirus during the adaptive study of interleukin- 2 dose on regulatory T cells in {{type 1 diabetes}} (DILT 1 D) allowed a detailed insight into the cellular and cytokine immune responses to this prevalent gastrointestinal pathogen. Methods: Serial blood, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were collected pre-, and post-development of the infection. To differentiate between the immune response to norovirus and to control for the administration of a single dose of <b>aldesleukin</b> (recombinant interleukin- 2, rIL- 2) alone, samples from five non-infected participants administered similar doses were analysed in parallel. Results: Norovirus infection was self-limited and resolved within 24 hours, with the subsequent development of anti-norovirus antibodies. Serum pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL- 10, peaked during the symptomatic period of infection, coincident with increased frequencies of monocytes and neutrophils. At the same time, the frequency of regulatory CD 4 + T cell (Treg), effector T cell (Teff) CD 4 + and CD 8 + subsets were dynamically reduced, rebounding to baseline levels or above at the next sampling point 24 hours later.  NK cells and NKT cells transiently increased CD 69 expression and classical monocytes expressed increased levels of CD 40, HLA-DR and SIGLEC- 1, biomarkers of an interferon response. We also observed activation and mobilisation of Teffs, where increased frequencies of CD 69 + and Ki- 67 + effector memory Teffs were followed {{by the emergence of}} memory CD 8 + Teff expressing the mucosal tissue homing markers CD 103 and β 7 integrin. Treg responses were coincident with the innate cell, Teff and cytokine response. Key Treg molecules FOXP 3, CTLA- 4, and CD 25 were upregulated following infection, alongside an increase in frequency of Tregs with the capacity to home to tissues. Conclusions: The results illustrate the innate, adaptive and counter-regulatory immune responses to norovirus infection. Low-dose IL- 2 administration induces many of the Treg responses observed during infection...|$|E
40|$|The Study of <b>Aldesleukin</b> {{with and}} without Antiretroviral Therapy (STALWART) was {{designed}} to evaluate whether intermittent IL- 2 alone or with peri-cycle ART increased CD 4 + cell counts (and so delayed initiation of ART) in HIV infected individuals having ≥ 300 CD 4 + cells/mm(3) compared to untreated controls. When the results of two large clinical trials, ESPRIT and SILCAAT, showed no clinical benefit from IL- 2 therapy, IL- 2 administration was halted in STALWART. Because IL- 2 recipients in STALWART experienced {{a greater number of}} opportunistic disease (OD) or death and adverse events (AEs), participants were asked to consent to an extended follow-up phase in order to assess persistence of IL- 2 effects. Participants in this study were followed for clinical events and AEs every 4 months for 24 months. Unadjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to summarize death, death or first OD event, and first grade 3 or 4 AE. A total of 267 persons were enrolled in STALWART (176 randomized to the IL- 2 arms and 91 to the no therapy arm); 142 individuals in the IL- 2 group and 80 controls agreed to enter the extended follow-up study. Initiation of continuous ART was delayed in the IL- 2 groups, but once started, resulted in similar CD 4 + cell and viral load responses compared to controls. The hazard ratios (95 % CI) for IL- 2 versus control during the extension phase for death or OD, grade 3 or 4 AE, and grade 4 AE were 1. 45 (0. 38, 5. 45), 0. 43 (0. 24, 1. 63) and 0. 20 (0. 04, 1. 03), respectively. The hazard ratios for the AE outcomes were significantly lower during the extension than during the main study. Adverse events associated with IL- 2 cycling did not persist upon discontinuation of IL- 2. The use of IL- 2 did not impact the subsequent response to initiation of cART...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{infection}} of a participant with norovirus during the adaptive study of interleukin- 2 dose on regulatory T cells in {{type 1 diabetes}} (DILT 1 D) allowed a detailed insight into the cellular and cytokine immune responses to this prevalent gastrointestinal pathogen. Methods: Serial blood, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were collected pre-, and post-development of the infection. To differentiate between the immune response to norovirus and to control for the administration of a single dose of <b>aldesleukin</b> (recombinant interleukin- 2, rIL- 2) alone, samples from five non-infected participants administered similar doses were analysed in parallel. Results: Norovirus infection was self-limited and resolved within 24 hours, with the subsequent development of anti-norovirus antibodies. Serum pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL- 10, peaked during the symptomatic period of infection, coincident with increased frequencies of monocytes and neutrophils. At the same time, the frequency of regulatory CD 4 + T cell (Treg), effector T cell (Teff) CD 4 + and CD 8 + subsets were dynamically reduced, rebounding to baseline levels or above at the next sampling point 24 hours later. NK cells and NKT cells transiently increased CD 69 expression and classical monocytes expressed increased levels of CD 40, HLA-DR and SIGLEC- 1, biomarkers of an interferon response. We also observed activation and mobilisation of Teffs, where increased frequencies of CD 69 + and Ki- 67 + effector memory Teffs were followed {{by the emergence of}} memory CD 8 + Teff expressing the mucosal tissue homing markers CD 103 and β 7 integrin. Treg responses were coincident with the innate cell, Teff and cytokine response. Key Treg molecules FOXP 3, CTLA- 4, and CD 25 were upregulated following infection, alongside an increase in frequency of Tregs with the capacity to home to tissues. Conclusions: The results illustrate the innate, adaptive and counter-regulatory immune responses to norovirus infection. Low-dose IL- 2 administration induces many of the Treg responses observed during infection.

Data available is the anonymised individual-participant-level results aggregated to appear as: Figures (10); Tables (2); Supplementary Figures (14); Supplementary Tables (8). The paper describes the impact of single doses of <b>aldesleukin</b> on 40 participants followed over the course of 2 - 3 months. While all obvious personal identifiers have been stripped from the individual-participant-level results, in our view it cannot be anonymised sufficiently {{to be able to put}} it into the public domain without risk of participant identification. Therefore, it cannot be hosted by the University of Cambridge research repository, but is instead available on application to the DILT 1 D Data Access Committee, contacted via fw 211 @cam. ac. uk, and on completion of a Data Access Agreement. The Data Access Committee consists of: the Chief Investigator; the Senior Trial Statistician; and the independent Trial Chair; with additional independent advice from the University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine's Information Governance team. Applications will be judged on the following criteria: 1. Has the application been submitted by bona fide researchers? 2. Is the application's purpose in line with the original aims of the trial, and the consents given? 3.

40|$|The GOLFIG- 2 phase III {{trial was}} {{designed}} to compare the immunobiological activity and antitumor efficacy of GOLFIG chemoimmunotherapy regimen with standard FOLFOX- 4 chemotherapy in frontline treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. This trial was conceived {{on the basis of}} previous evidence of antitumor and immunomodulating activity of the GOLFIG regimen in mCRC. GOLFIG- 2 is a multicentric open/label phase III trial (EUDRACT: 2005 - 003458 - 81). Chemo-naive mCRC patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive biweekly standard FOLFOX- 4 or GOLFIG [gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2), day 1); oxaliplatin (85 mg/m(2), day 2); levofolinate (100 mg/m(2), days 1 - 2), 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) (400 mg/m(2) in bolus followed by 24 h infusion at 800 mg/m(2),days 1 - 2), sc. GM-CSF (100 μg, days 3 - 7); sc. <b>aldesleukin</b> (0 · 5 MIU bi-daily, days 8 - 14 and 17 - 30) ] treatments. The study underwent early termination because of poor recruitment in the control arm. After a median follow-up of 43. 83 months, GOLFIG regimen showed superiority over FOLFOX in terms of progression-free survival [median 9 · 23 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 6 · 9 - 11. 5) vs. median 5. 70 (95 % CI, 3. 38 - 8. 02) months; hazard ratio (HR) : 0. 52 (95 % CI, 0. 35 - 0. 77), P= 0 · 002] and response rate [66. 1 % (95 % CI, 0. 41 - 0. 73) vs. 37 · 0 % (95 % CI, 0. 28 - 0. 59), P= 0. 002], with a trend to longer survival [median 21. 63 (95 % CI, 18. 09 - 25. 18) vs. 14. 57 mo (95 % CI, 9. 07 - 20. 07); HR: 0 · 79 (95 % CI, 0. 52 - 1. 21); P= 0. 28]. Patients in the experimental arm showed higher incidence of non-neutropenic fever (18. 5 %), autoimmunity signs (18. 5 %), {{an increase in the number}} of monocytes, eosinophils, CD 4 (+) T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and a decrease in immunoregulatory (CD 3 (+) CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) FoxP 3 (+)) T cells.
