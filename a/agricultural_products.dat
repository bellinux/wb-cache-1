Using the TOE theoretical framework, we analyze factors that influencing RFID adoption in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>product</b> distribution industry based on the following three contexts: technological, organizational, and environmental contexts.

40|$|In recent years, food security, {{especially}} supply, {{has been}} an important issue in China’s agricultural production. The stability of grain prices is related to the stability and development of the grain market. Based on agricultural production data from 1970 to 2015, this paper explores the influence of <b>agricultural</b> <b>product</b> price fluctuation on grain production by using the cobweb theory and vector error correction (VEC) model. The results show that changes in grain production in China are affected by fluctuations in <b>agricultural</b> <b>product</b> prices, that the production change lags behind the price change, {{and that there is a}} long-term equilibrium relationship between grain yield and <b>agricultural</b> <b>product</b> price. A Granger causality test shows that the change in <b>agricultural</b> <b>product</b> price is the Granger cause of grain yield change...|$|R
