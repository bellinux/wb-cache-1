40|$|Male {{mortality}} rates exceeded female rates in every death type and the sex differential increased from 1970 to 1980 in every death type except homicides. The {{findings in this}} study suggest that marital and employment factors contribute to sex differences in mortality for suicidal and <b>accidental</b> <b>deaths.</b> Being employed was associated with fewer suicidal and <b>accidental</b> <b>deaths</b> for females than for males. Being married was associated with fewer suicidal and <b>accidental</b> <b>deaths</b> for males, while marital status had no relationship to suicidal and <b>accidental</b> <b>deaths</b> for females. Due to these relationships it might be inferred that the expanding sex differential in suicidal and accidental {{mortality rates}} is associated with the spiraling divorce rate and the dramatic increase in female employment. Results relative to homicidal deaths appear ambiguous and do not offer support for the hypothesis that marital and employment factors contribute to the observed sex differences in homicidal death rates...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Infectious {{causes of}} {{childhood}} {{deaths in the}} world have decreased substantially in the 21 st century. This trend has exposed <b>accidental</b> <b>deaths</b> as an increasingly important future challenge. Presently, {{little is known about the}} cause structure of <b>accidental</b> childhood <b>deaths</b> in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings. In this paper, we aim to establish cause structure for <b>accidental</b> <b>deaths</b> in children aged 0 - 4 years in China in the year 2010. METHODS: In this paper, we explored the database of 208 multi-cause child mortality studies in Chinese that formed a basis for the first published estimate of the causes of child deaths in China (for the year 2008). Only five of those studies identified specific causes of <b>accidental</b> <b>deaths.</b> Because of this, we searched the Chinese medical literature databases CNKI and WanFang for single-cause mortality studies that were focused on <b>accidental</b> <b>deaths.</b> We identified 71 further studies that provided specific causes for <b>accidental</b> <b>deaths.</b> We used epidemiological modeling to estimate the number of <b>accidental</b> child <b>deaths</b> in China in 2010 and to assign those deaths to specific causes. RESULTS: In 2010, we estimated 314 [*] 581 deaths in children 0 - 4 years in China, of which 31 [*] 633 (10. 1 %) were <b>accidental.</b> <b>Accidental</b> <b>deaths</b> contributed 7240 (4. 0 %) of all deaths in neonatal period, 8838 (10. 5 %) among all post-neonatal infant deaths, and 15 [*] 554 (31. 7 %) among children with 1 - 4 years of age. Among four tested models, the most predictive was used to establish the likely cause structure of <b>accidental</b> <b>deaths</b> in China. We estimated that asphyxia caused 9490 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 8224 - 11 [*] 072), drowning 5694 (95 % CI 5061 - 6327), traffic accidents 3796 (95 % CI 3163 - 4745), poisoning 3163 (95 % CI 2531 - 3796) and falls 2531 (95 % CI 2214 - 3163) deaths. Based on medians from a few rare studies, we also predict 633 (95 % CI 316 - 1265) deaths to be due to burns and 316 (95 % CI 0 - 633) due to falling objects. Together, these 7 causes explain more than 80 % of all <b>accidental</b> <b>deaths</b> when modeling is primarily used, and more than 95 % when the analysis is based purely on medians from the 76 available studies. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in global child mortality is a leading political priority and <b>accidental</b> <b>deaths</b> will soon emerge as one of the main challenges. In this paper we provided a detailed breakdown of causes of these deaths in a large middle-income country. We noted that, wherever the share of <b>accidental</b> <b>deaths</b> among all child deaths is increased, drowning is more likely to be the leading cause; asphyxia seems to be equally important in all contexts, while traffic accidents, poisoning and falls are relatively more important in contexts where the overall share of accidents to all child deaths is low.

5|$|According to Rose, {{the police}} let {{themselves}} into the house using Floyd's keys, without knocking or announcing themselves, while Cynthia and her family were watching television. The family said that an officer pushed Cynthia, causing her to fall. The officer denied this; the police said {{she had not been}} pushed but had simply collapsed. When it became clear she had stopped breathing, the same officer tried to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, to no avail. The pathologist testified at the inquest that the fall may have been a precipitating factor; the jury returned a verdict of <b>accidental</b> <b>death,</b> following the coroner's direction that such a verdict would mean Cynthia had been pushed, but perhaps accidentally.|$|E
5|$|After the convention, {{support for}} Nasjonal Samling, and Quisling {{personal}}ly, ebbed away.

In addition, the lex Eilifsen ex-post facto law of August 1943, {{which led to the}} first death sentence passed by the regime, was widely seen as a blatant violation of the Constitution and a sign of Norway's increasing role in the Final Solution, would destroy everything the convention had achieved in terms of boosting party morale.|$|E
5|$|Riot Act is {{the seventh}} studio album by American rock band Pearl Jam, {{released}} on November 12, 2002 through Epic Records.

The band then reconvened {{in the beginning of}} 2002 and commenced work on a new album. The music on the record featured a diverse sound, including songs influenced by folk, art rock, and experimental rock. The lyrics deal with mortality and existentialism, with much influence from both the political climate after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the <b>accidental</b> <b>death</b> of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival.|$|E

While travelling on foot to the woods, the brothers come across an old man on a snowmobile. Jacob, thinking that their cover is blown, bludgeons him. When the man regains consciousness, Hank suffocates him, then uses the snowmobile to drive his body off a bridge, making the murder look like an <b>accidental</b> <b>death.</b> The following night, Lou drunkenly demands some of the money from Hank, because he has spent recklessly since the discovery. When Hank refuses, Lou threatens to go to the authorities, having learned from Jacob about the old man's murder.|$|E
5|$|Shen Kuo's Dream Pool Essays {{argued against}} {{traditional}} Chinese beliefs in anatomy (such as his argument for two throat valves instead of three); this perhaps spurred {{the interest in}} the performance of post-mortem autopsies in China during the 12th century. The physician and judge known as Song Ci (1186–1249) wrote a pioneering work of forensic science on the examination of corpses in order to determine cause of death (strangulation, poisoning, drowning, blows, etc.) and to prove whether death resulted from murder, suicide, or <b>accidental</b> <b>death.</b> Song Ci stressed the importance of proper coroner's conduct during autopsies and the accurate recording of the inquest of each autopsy by official clerks.|$|E
5|$|Drug {{overdose}} and intoxication {{are significant}} causes of <b>accidental</b> <b>death,</b> {{and can also}} be used as a form of suicide. Death can occur from overdosing on a single or multiple drugs, or from combined drug intoxication (CDI) due to poly drug use. Poly drug use often carries more risk than use of a single drug, due to an increase in side effects, and drug synergy. For example, the chance of death from overdosing on opiates is greatly increased when they are consumed in conjunction with alcohol. While they are two distinct phenomena, deaths from CDI are often misreported as overdoses. Drug overdoses and intoxication can also cause indirect deaths. For example, while marijuana does not cause fatal overdoses, being intoxicated by it can increase the chance of fatal traffic collisions.|$|E

5|$|In many {{countries}} {{the rate of}} suicide is highest in the middle-aged or elderly. The absolute number of suicides however is greatest in those between 15 and 29 years old due {{to the number of}} people in this age group. In the United States it is greatest in Caucasian men older than 80 years, even though younger people more frequently attempt suicide. It is the second most common cause of death in adolescents and in young males is second only to <b>accidental</b> <b>death.</b> In young males in the developed world it is the cause of nearly 30% of mortality. In the developing world rates are similar, but it makes up a smaller proportion of overall deaths due to higher rates of death from other types of trauma. In South-East Asia in contrast to other areas of the world, deaths from suicide occur at a greater rate in young females than elderly females.|$|E
