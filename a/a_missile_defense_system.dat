25|$|On June 27, Iran {{moved its}} Shihab-3 {{ballistic}} missiles into launch positions within striking {{range of the}} Israeli nuclear reactor at Dimona. On April 15, the Israeli Arrow 2 anti-ballistic missile system successfully intercepted a simulated Iranian Shihab-3 medium-range ballistic missile. On July 6, Israel tested Iron Dome, <b>a</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> that is under development.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Senator Barbara Boxer (CA-D) and Congressman Steve Israel (NY-D) {{introduced}} legislation {{in both the}} House and Senate (H.R. 580/S. 311 The Commercial Airline Missile Defense Act) that directed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to sponsor a research and development program {{that would result in}} <b>a</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> that could be installed on commercial airliners; the bill also authorized funding for the program.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, the United States {{withdrew from}} the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty {{in order to move}} forward with plans for <b>a</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> <b>system.</b> Putin called the {{decision}} a mistake. Russia strongly opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, though without exercising its veto in the United Nations Security Council. Russia has regarded the expansion of NATO into the old Eastern Bloc, and U.S. efforts to gain access to Central Asian oil and natural gas as a potentially hostile encroachment on Russia's sphere of influence.|$|E
500|$|The {{commission}} reentered {{the public}} consciousness in 2000 when {{the former chairman of}} the commission, Donald Rumsfeld, was named by newly elected President George W. Bush to be Secretary of Defense, his second time in that office. On December 30, 2000, Richard Garwin, a former commissioner, praised Rumsfeld for his commission work in a New York Times op-ed piece, although he reiterated that the commission never suggested whether or not the US should build <b>a</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> <b>system.</b> [...] Other staffers and members of the commission were also appointed by the new Bush administration: Paul Wolfowitz was named Deputy Secretary of Defense, William Schneider, Jr. was appointed by Rumsfeld to the Defense Science Board, and in March 2003 Stephen Cambone was selected by Rumsfeld to fill the newly created Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence position. [...] Robert Gates, the man who conducted the first review of the ballistic missile threat, was appointed Secretary of Defense after Rumsfeld's November 2006 resignation.|$|E
2500|$|The Boeing YAL-1 Airborne Laser Testbed (formerly Airborne Laser) {{weapons system}} was a megawatt-class {{chemical}} oxygen iodine laser (COIL) mounted inside a modified Boeing 747-400F. It is primarily designed as <b>a</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> to destroy tactical ballistic missiles (TBMs) while in boost phase. [...] The aircraft was designated YAL-1A in 2004 by the U.S. Department of Defense.|$|E
50|$|The {{proposed}} U.S. <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> {{received attention}} at the Helsinki summit, where Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to {{an interpretation of the}} 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty allowing the United States to proceed with <b>a</b> limited <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> currently under development. Specifically, Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to distinguish between <b>a</b> national <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> <b>system,</b> aimed against strategic weapons, not allowed by the ABMT, and <b>a</b> theater <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> to guard against shorter range missile attacks. Some critics thought that any agreement of this kind would place undesirable limits on the development of both theater and strategic <b>missile</b> <b>defenses.</b> The Helsinki meeting also saw progress in arms control negotiations between the United States and Russia, a matter high on Cohen's agenda. Yeltsin and Clinton agreed on the need for early Russian ratification of the Second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) and negotiation of START III to make further significant cuts in the strategic nuclear arsenals of both nations.|$|R

50|$|Space {{systems that}} can degrade include {{photographic}} imaging and satellite interception. These {{will become increasingly}} critical.

2500|$|In October 2007, Vladimir Putin visited Iran {{to discuss}} Russia's aid to Iran's nuclear power program and [...] "insisted {{that the use}} of force was unacceptable." [...] On October 17, Bush stated [...] "if you're {{interested}} in avoiding World War III, it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon," [...] understood as a message to Putin. A week later Putin compared U.S. plans to put up <b>a</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> near Russia's border as analogous to when the Soviet Union deployed missiles in Cuba, prompting the Cuban Missile Crisis.|$|E

500|$|The {{argument}} for <b>a</b> national <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> in the United States was traditionally {{to protect the}} country from <b>a</b> Soviet <b>missile</b> attack.
