500|$|Prior to this, in 1992, the ABO {{had changed}} their {{certification}} program, which had previously awarded lifetime certifications, instead requiring doctors to recertify every 10 years. Those {{who had already}} been given lifetime certification were allowed to keep it (according to the ABO, they would not legally {{have been able to}} rescind these certifications). Shortly after this change, Paul began a campaign to protest it. This effort culminated in 1997 with him creating, [...] "along with 200 other young ophthalmologists", the National Board of Ophthalmology (NBO) to offer an <b>alternative</b> <b>certification</b> system, at a cost substantially lower than that of the ABO. Its certification exam, an open book take-home test, was described by one taker as [...] "probably harder" [...] and [...] "more clinically relevant" [...] than the ABO's exam.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} an <b>alternative</b> teacher <b>certification</b> pathway {{known as}} Teach for Australia (TFA) {{that is currently}} operating in the Australian state of Victoria. A discursive approach informed by critical theory {{is used in the}} paper to critically examine the specific case of TFA as an <b>alternative</b> teacher <b>certification</b> pathway charged with improving student learning outcomes and reducing educational disadvantage. The problematization of educational programmes such as TFA, including specific terms and statements found in TFA documentation, features prominently in the paper alongside the political and economic policy context of public education. The argument and central contention of the paper is that TFA will not overcome educational disadvantage; nor will it over time improve student learning outcome...|$|R

40|$|I {{examine the}} passage of <b>alternative</b> teacher <b>certification</b> {{policies}} in the states between 1975 and 2000 using event history analysis and supplementing the event history analysis with an ordinary least squares regression analysis {{of the strength of}} the <b>alternative</b> teacher <b>certification</b> policies. In order to test both teachers unions political strength external to state legislatures and teachers unions political strength internal to state legislatures, I use two variables to measure teachers union political strength. One variable measures the percentage of teachers in a state who work under union-negotiated contracts. The other variable measures the percentage of legislators in a state who list their non-legislative occupation as K- 12 education. Control variables include teacher shortages, per pupil spending, legislative professionalism, divided government, democratic governor, percentage of minority students, change in percentage of minority students, an electoral threat index, and a time counter. Although the event history model results were inconclusive with respect to the teachers union political strength variables, the policy strength model results reveal that states with large percentages of teachers who work under union-negotiated contracts are more likely than other states to pass weak <b>alternative</b> teacher <b>certification</b> policies. This result supports the notion that teachers unions operate in the education policy-making arena...|$|R

50|$|Alternative teacher {{certification}} {{is a process}} by which a person is awarded a teaching license even though that person has not completed a traditional {{teacher certification}} program. In the US, traditional teacher certification is earned through completing a bachelor's or master's degree in education, taking standardized tests (usually a Praxis test), and fulfilling additional state requirements. Alternatively certified teachers typically possess a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university and are completing (or have completed) an <b>alternative</b> <b>certification</b> program while teaching full-time. Other state certification requirements, such as the type of education coursework or the length of practice teaching, may be modified or waived. In the United States, <b>alternative</b> <b>certification</b> is offered in forty-eight states and the District of Columbia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alternative</b> <b>certification</b> {{programs}} {{first appeared}} in the 1980s. A {{decline in the number of}} students seeking a degree in education was creating a shortage of teachers in American elementary and high schools. States began to search for a way to recruit and train people who had already earned a four-year degree and wanted to become teachers. While the requirements for an <b>alternative</b> <b>certification</b> vary from state to state, there are certain commonalities found in the programs. A prospective teacher is usually required to complete an accelerated university program, pass the state licensing test, and submit to a series of interviews. He or she must be able to demonstrate a mastery of educational methods, and participate in a mentor program with a teacher who has completed a traditional education degree.|$|E

This paper critically analyzes the use of two international models of teacher development that {{play the role of}} <b>alternative</b> and additional <b>certifications</b> for ELT professionals in the country. Through the review of literature in the field, the author argues that the current promotion of the use of the In-Service Certificate in English Language Teaching (ICELT) and the Teaching Knowledge Test (TKT) as additional and <b>alternative</b> teaching <b>certifications</b> may represent some forms of standardization, exclusion, inequality, and businessification in the professional development of EFL teachers. Conclusions suggest the need for more critical voices from teacher educators, better communication strategies among different educational actors and the construction of a more pluralistic view of the professional development of EFL teachers that values local knowledge...|$|R

We conclude that to create reliable systems, we must start certifying the individual constituents of the systems. ...|$|R
