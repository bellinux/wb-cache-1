40|$|The paper’s {{purpose is}} to {{investigate}} and to criticize the quantitative method used by <b>antitrust</b> <b>authorities</b> to analyze mergers unilateral effects. Until the nineties the method used by <b>antitrust</b> <b>authorities</b> was discretionary, based on a structural analysis of the market or the relevant market delimitation {{and the possibility of}} market power. Recently, the <b>antitrust</b> <b>authorities</b> have implemented a new method, called ‘merger simulation’ or the use of an oligopoly model with a demand system that predict the post merger prices and outputs. The problems with this new method are that two: these inherent implications, such that i) the dependence on the inherent curvature properties of the demand system; ii) the assumption that marginal cost does not vary in the relevant range; iii) the simplicity of the static oligopoly model; iv) the absence of market structural change {{as a consequence of the}} merger; and the relationship that this new method made with the variables structure and performance, like the questionable structuralism theory. merger; unilateral effects; merger simulation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{literature}} on merger policy in open economies. We first adopt a reduced-form approach to derive general insights on the scope for conflict between national <b>antitrust</b> <b>authorities</b> and on the gains from international merger policy coordination. Taking trade costs as given, we use standard oligopoly models to derive conditions on market structure, under which underenforcement or overenforcement of national merger policies can arise. We then study the interactions between merger policy and trade policy, and find that trade liberalization often leads to stricter national merger policies. We conclude by discussing empirical evidence on conflict between <b>antitrust</b> <b>authorities...</b>|$|R

50|$|While it is indisputable that a {{concentration}} {{may lead to}} a reduction in output and result in higher prices and thus in a welfare loss to consumers, the <b>antitrust</b> <b>authority</b> faces the challenge of applying various economic theories and rules in a legally binding procedure.|$|E

3000|$|To {{complete}} the analysis let us {{think of a}} situation, which is usually the case, where <b>antitrust</b> <b>authorities</b> have less information than firms involved in a merger. Then, if firms submit a V merger proposal that is not expected at equilibrium, that is for γ/β> 0.0958 and [...] n= 2, <b>antitrust</b> <b>authorities</b> should infer that this V merger will come out with cost efficiencies and, therefore, should be approved. This {{is an indication that}} the strategic incentives to merge have being countervailed by efficiency gains (such as production cost savings through economies of scale and scope, improvements in quality or service, reductions in transactional costs or increased incentives for R&D processes, and so on) anticipated by the firms which are making the V merger more profitable than a H one in that case. Since efficiency gains are good for consumers, <b>antitrust</b> <b>authorities</b> will be more willing to accept the proposed merger. In other words, when firms propose a type of merger different from the equilibrium one, authorities face cases where the efficiency effects obtained are substantial to make that merger type preferable.|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{to answer}} our initial {{research}} question, {{it is important}} to analyze whether the proposed mergers arising from the previous subsection would be cleared by <b>antitrust</b> <b>authorities.</b> <b>Antitrust</b> <b>authorities</b> make decisions based on how the proposed merger affects either Consumer Surplus (CS) or Social Welfare (SW) standards. To obtain the Social Welfare measure we take the utility function and subtract the costs paid by firms. Then, to obtain Consumer Surplus, we have to subtract the profits of all firms in the market to the Social Welfare. The precise expressions {{can be found in the}} Appendix. Which merger is socially preferred is in the next proposition.|$|R
