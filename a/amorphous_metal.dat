(A microscopically-small piece of metal may naturally form into a single crystal, but larger pieces generally do not.) Ionic compound materials are usually crystalline or polycrystalline. In practice, large salt crystals can be created by solidification of a molten fluid, or by crystallization out of a solution. Covalently bonded solids (sometimes called covalent network solids) are also very common, notable examples being diamond and quartz. Weak van der Waals forces also help hold together certain crystals, such as crystalline molecular solids, {{as well as the}} interlayer bonding in graphite. Polymer materials generally will form crystalline regions, but the lengths of the molecules usually prevent complete crystallization—and sometimes polymers are completely amorphous.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Since the {{discovery}} of the first metallic glass in 1960 (1), <b>amorphous</b> <b>metals</b> have been made in a variety of compositions. However, they have been largely fabricated as thin ribbons less than a millimeter in thickness because fast cooling rates (; 10 6 K/sec) have been required to retain the metastable amorphous phase. Recently, however, a new class of <b>amorphous</b> <b>metals</b> has been developed which require cooling rates of only 1 K/sec (2); these alloys, such as Zr 41. 2 Ti 13. 8 Cu 12. 5 Ni 10 Be 22. 5 (at%), can thus be processed in bulk form. <b>Amorphous</b> <b>metals</b> have generated much interest, both in basic research and for structural applications, because of their near-theoretical strength to stiffness ratios and extremely low damping characteristics (3).

40|$|<b>Amorphous</b> <b>metals,</b> {{especially}} bulk {{metallic glasses}} (BMGs), are highly applicable for new structural materials {{as a substitute}} for conventional crystalline metals due to superior mechanical properties, and thus occupy a unique niche compared with other classes of engineering materials. However, they usually suffer from a strong tendency for shear localization and macroscopically brittle failure at room temperature, which restricts structural application of BMGs (Schuh et al., 2007). Although the underlying deformation physics of these materials establishes less firmly as compared with crystalline metals, understanding of shear banding is particularly important in <b>amorphous</b> <b>metals</b> because shear bands {{play a crucial role in}} controlling plasticity and failure at ambient temperature. First of all, to discuss why the deformation behavior of <b>amorphous</b> <b>metals</b> presents a great contrast to crystalline metals, the atomistic understanding of these two materials is necessary. It has been widely known in soil mechanics that the shear of randomly closed-packed grains causes dilatation phenomena (Reynolds, 1885), e. g., the disappearance of water underneath feet on a wet beach because of the shear induced by the weight. The same mechanism can be applied to the atomic scale deformation in <b>amorphous</b> <b>metals.</b> Fig. 1 shows the atomic structures of crystalline and <b>amorphous</b> <b>metals.</b> When the crystalline metals are exposed to shear stress, they maintain the initial volume during plastic deformation because the periodicity along the slip planes provides identical atomic positions for the sheared material. On the other hand, <b>amorphous</b> <b>metals,</b> which have a random structure, increase their internal free volume as they plastically deform and must leave some voids. In general, the nucleation of nano-voids is more favorable on tensile side than compressive side, which indicates that the hydrostatic component of stress affects void nucleation. As a result of deformation, dislocations and shear bands are formed in crystalline and <b>amorphous</b> <b>metals,</b> respectively (Fig. 2...|$|R

The <b>amorphous</b> <b>metals</b> produce so-called card model type chip exhibiting lamellar slip structure, which has been formed due to periodical occurrence of homogeneous plastic deformation in the primary deformation zone and following catastrophic shear along the localized band. The lamellar slip spacing is found to be proportional to the depth of cut. The size effect on the specific cutting force is not obvious. It is also found that the shear stress along the shear zone is almost independent of the depth of cut, the normal stress, the shear strain and the strain rate.

Iron-based <b>amorphous</b> <b>metals</b> have incredible strength and hardness, {{and with the}} addition of alloying constituents, can also be formulated to have exceptional corrosion resistance. Compositions of several iron-based <b>amorphous</b> <b>metals</b> have been published, including several with very good corrosion resistance.

The compositions explored in this thesis research are the SAM 40 base alloy and variations including systematic additions of nickel, yttrium, and titanium. Nickel is added to improve both mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. Yttrium is added to lower the critical cooling rate, thereby making the metallic glass easier to create and more stable once formed, thus improving the corrosion resistance. Adding titanium will enable the formation of an extremely stable protective titanium oxide film on the alloy's surface, which could enhance the corrosion resistance.

50|$|The alloy was the {{end result}} of a {{research}} program into <b>amorphous</b> <b>metals</b> carried out at Caltech. It was {{the first of a series}} of experimental alloys that could achieve an amorphous structure at relatively slow cooling rates. <b>Amorphous</b> <b>metals</b> had been made before, but only in small batches because cooling rates needed to be in the millions of degrees per second. For example, amorphous wires could be fabricated by splat quenching a stream of molten metal on a spinning disk. Because Vitreloy allowed such slow cooling rates, production of larger batch sizes was possible. More recently, a number of additional alloys have been added to the Liquidmetal portfolio. These alloys also retain their amorphous structure after repeated re-heating, allowing them to be used in a wide variety of traditional machining processes.|$|R
