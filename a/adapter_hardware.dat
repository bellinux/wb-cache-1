50|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that the broadband adapter was released with two model numbers (HIT-0400 for US, and HIT-0401 for Japan). This is actually a misunderstanding as all broadband adapters from Japan or the US have the code HIT-0400. The code HIT-0401 actually refers to the Japanese broadband adapters' packaging and documentation, and the code HIT-0400 refers to the <b>adapter</b> <b>hardware</b> itself. The adapters are not region coded, so an American (or Japanese) adapter could be used on a PAL system and vice versa.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Adapter</b> <b>hardware</b> varies widely. When not {{integrated}} into a development board, it involves a short cable to attach to a JTAG connector on the target board; {{a connection to the}} debugging host, such as a USB, PCI, or Ethernet link; and enough electronics to adapt the two communications domains (and sometimes provide galvanic isolation). A separate power supply may be needed. There are both [...] "dumb" [...] adapters, where the host decides and performs all JTAG operations; and [...] "smart" [...] ones, where some of that work is performed inside the adapter, often driven by a microcontroller. The [...] "smart" [...] adapters eliminate link latencies for operation sequences that may involve polling for status changes between steps, and may accordingly offer faster throughput.|$|E
50|$|The palette itself stores {{a limited}} number of {{distinct}} colors; 4, 16 or 256 are the most common cases. These limits are often imposed by the target architecture's display <b>adapter</b> <b>hardware,</b> so it is not a coincidence that those numbers are exact powers of two (the binary code): 22 = 4, 24 = 16 and 28 = 256. While 256 values can be fit into a single 8-bit byte (and then a single indexed colorpixel also occupies a single byte), pixel indices with 16 (4-bit, a nibble) or fewer colors can be packed together into a single byte (two nibbles per byte, if 16 colors are employed, or four 2-bit pixels per byte if using 4 colors). Sometimes, 1-bit (2-color) values can be used, and then up to eight pixels can be packed into a single byte; suchimages are considered binary images (sometimes referred as a bitmap or bilevel image) and not an indexed color image.|$|E
5000|$|The {{video is}} {{produced}} by on-board display hardware, which is capable of all seven BIOS-supported modes of the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) plus additional 160×200 16-color, 320×200 16-color, and 640×200 4-color modes. The latter two modes and the 80×25 text mode, collectively called the [...] "high-bandwidth" [...] modes by IBM, require the optional 64 KB internal memory upgrade card, which doubles the amount of system RAM from the base 64 KB to 128 KB (specifically by providing the second 64 KB starting at address 0x10000). (Upgrading the memory by other means, such as adding a RAM [...] "sidecar" [...] adapter, is not adequate to support the high-bandwidth graphics modes.) Like the CGA, the PCjr has a composite pseudo-NTSC video output that supports using a color or black-and-white television set, and the PCjr's video <b>adapter</b> <b>hardware</b> is also capable of the common undocumented composite artifact colors mode of CGA, which is entered by enabling composite color (referred to as [...] "color burst") in the 640×200 graphics mode. The PCjr is also capable of the semi-documented 160×100 16-color CGA graphics mode, although except for programming considerations, there is no advantage to using this mode instead of the 160×200 16-color PCjr graphics mode. The fully programmable 16-color palette logic in the PCjr allows any set of colors from among the 16-color RGBI color set - {{the same set of}} colors available in CGA text modes - in each mode. That is, in each graphics mode, each pixel [...] "color" [...] value can be independently mapped to any one of the 16 real RGBI colors. (The IBM Technical Reference is unclear as to whether the programmable palette is active in the text modes, where all 16 colors are available even without palette mapping.) When the BIOS is used to set a video mode, it always sets up the PCjr palette table (i.e. the 16 palette registers) to emulate the CGA color palette for that mode. Programs specifically written to use PCjr graphics can subsequently reprogram the palette table to use any colors desired. Palette changes must be made during horizontal or vertical blanking periods of a video frame in order to avoid corrupting the display. However, the provision of a vertical retrace interrupt (on IRQ5) simplifies this and also makes seamless page-flipping much easier. The video hardware of the PCjr is the first to offer a vertical retrace interrupt, or any raster interrupt. The PCjr video subsystem also has a little-known graphics blink feature, which toggles the palette {{between the first and second}} groups of eight palette registers at the same rate used for the text blink feature, and a palette bit-masking feature that could be used to switch between palette subsets without reprogramming palette registers, by forcing one or more bits of each pixel value to zero before the value is used to look up the color in the palette table.|$|E

40|$|Are you {{considering}} a C++ rewrite {{of an existing}} C program? Are you skeptical about the benefits on OO design might provide? My experience rewriting an MS-DOS program for testing graphics adapter cards on IBM-PC compatible computers is related here. Besides describing the “lessons learned”, I’ll also provide some valuable guidelines {{you can use to}} successfully reengineer existing systems using OO and C++. Prior to my redesign, I had converted the original C program to compile as a C++ program. Several problems cropped up, as described in my previous article. 1 However, this conversion allowed me to add functionality using C++ classes even though the overall design was not objectoriented. In this article I’ll show that a redesign can improve modularity, reduce code size, and produce a significant number of reusable components. Modern graphics adapters are very complex and provide a staggering range of features and operating modes. Although I intend to focus on C++ and the redesign process I first need to explain some of the basic functionality of graphics <b>adapter</b> <b>hardware.</b> Anatomy of a Graphics Adapter The major components of a graphics adapter are the CRT controller (CRTC), the digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and video memory (VRAM). The adapter can be designed to interface with the ISA bus architecture, but higher performance is possible using the PCI or VESA local bus. The relationship between the adapter components is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 – The relationship between the <b>adapter</b> <b>hardware</b> components. The basic CRT controller functions are based on the Motorola 6845, the mother of modern graphics controllers. These functions control the scanning of the electron beam inside the CRT, which determines the width and height of the display. The CRTC is also responsible for displaying the text cursor. Besides CRT operations, many other functions are needed for complete graphics control...|$|E
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} analyses, mechanical analyses, {{and stress}} tests of a 20 -inch diameter advanced fan design intended for acoustic investigation by NASA-LeRC are discussed. A high tip speed transonic fan rotor was scaled directly to 20. 0 inches (0. 508 m) from a 28. 74 -inch (0. 73 -m) diameter rotor. A new stator {{was designed and}} fabricated for the fan and incorporated with a test rig housing and <b>adapter</b> <b>hardware</b> for installation in the NASA-LeRC Jet Noise Facility for acoustic evaluation. The stator was designed to allow mounting at three axial locations, and the fan, housing, and adapters are reversible so that either the inlet or the exhaust ends of the assembly face the open room of the test facility. Excellent aerodynamic performance is predicted, and a low noise signature is expected since the unique aerodynamic design features of this fan are directly conductive to producing minimum sound power...|$|E

40|$|The DTM host/network adapter uses a {{dual-ported}} shared {{buffer memory}} {{on the interface}} board as in the Van Jacobson "Witless" interface [9]. The host operating system, SunOS, performs all protocol processing in the shared buffer memory and can therefore minimize {{the number of times}} data have to be transferred over the host system bus. We give an overview of the DTM host/network <b>adapter</b> <b>hardware</b> design emphasizing on the software visible parts. These parts include the dual-ported shared memory, the interrupt mechanism, control and status registers, and the FIFO queues used for managing buffers in the shared memory. The software controlling the hardware adapter constitutes a network interface driver in the SunOS operating system kernel. This driver implements the DTM service specification [7]. We describe how the adapter is managed by the driver and the operating system. In particular, we describe the modifications to the buffer system (mbufs) and socket layer that is necessary to use the on-board buffer memory in an efficient way. One modification for out-bound data is that the socket layer must know which particular network interface the data is destined for, at the time when the data is copied from the user application buffers into the mbuf buffers, so that the mbufs can be allocated in the on-board memory. We also describe the protocol layering on top of DTM and the design of the socket application interface to the DTM packet service. We introduce a DTM "link layer" protocol for addressing and encapsulating IP and other higher level protocols.

40|$|The J 300 {{family of}} {{video and audio}} {{products}} is a feature-rich set of multimedia <b>hardware</b> <b>adapters</b> developed by Digital for its Alpha workstations. This paper describes the design {{and implementation of the}} J 300 software architecture, focusing on the Sound & Motion J 300 product. The software approach taken was to consider the hardware as two separate devices: the J 300 audio subsystem and the J 300 video subsystem. Libraries corresponding to the two subsystems provide application programming interfaces that offer flexible control of the hardware while supporting a client-server model for multimedia applications. The design places special emphasis on performance by favoring an asynchronous I/O programming model implemented through an innovative use of queues. The kernel-mode device driver is portable across devices because it requires minimal knowledge of the hardware. The overall design aims at easing application programming while extracting real-time performance from a non-real-time operating system. The software architecture has been successfully implemented over multiple platforms, including those based on the OpenVMS, Microsoft Windows NT, and Digital UNIX operating systems, and is the foundation on which software for Digital’s current video capture, compression, and rendering <b>hardware</b> <b>adapters</b> exists...|$|R
50|$|Direct {{recording}} of mobile phone calls requires a <b>hardware</b> <b>adapter</b> {{connected to the}} handset. There are many other ways to record mobile phone calls.

Another approach links directly into existing recording systems from a PDA phone. Both of these approaches allow recordings to be timestamped, often required for legal reasons. Recording directly onto mobile devices does provide a legally valid recording in many countries.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis described {{the design and}} implementation of a fiber optic link for a token ring local area network (LAN). It features the use of fiber optic channels as the transmission medium between a computer system and a wiring concentrator to convert a physical ring design into a star-wired configuration. The LAN was controlled by the TMS 380 LAN Adapter chipset, which provided all diagnostic and network management features to include the 4 Mb/s electrical signal for operation. Since this adapter was developed for systems using twisted wire pair adapter cables, design modifications required that the fiber link be able to simulate impedance and current characteristics of the copper wire link. This allows the use of adapter diagnostic checks for ring continuity and proper ring operation. Design evaluations using test signals and adapter signals from within the computer-concentrator link shower mixed results. All transmission objectives were met, but the circuit loaded down the LAN <b>adapter</b> causing <b>hardware</b> error messages. [URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|R
