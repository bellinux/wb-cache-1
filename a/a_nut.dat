5|$|In Norse mythology, {{the goddess}} Iðunn is {{portrayed in the}} Prose Edda (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) as {{providing}} apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism developed. She points out that buckets of apples {{were found in the}} Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into <b>a</b> <b>nut</b> in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England.|$|E

25|$|Many {{common terms}} for seeds and fruit do not {{correspond}} to the botanical classifications. In culinary terminology, a fruit is usually any sweet-tasting plant part, especially a botanical fruit; <b>a</b> <b>nut</b> is any hard, oily, and shelled plant product; and a vegetable is any savory or less sweet plant product. However, in botany, a fruit is the ripened ovary or carpel that contains seeds, <b>a</b> <b>nut</b> {{is a type of}} fruit and not a seed, and a seed is a ripened ovule.|$|E

25|$|A {{torque wrench}} {{is a tool}} used to {{precisely}} apply a specific torque to a fastener such as <b>a</b> <b>nut</b> or bolt.

25|$|Hyacinth macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) {{have been}} {{repeatedly}} observed to use tools when breaking open nuts, for example, {{pieces of wood}} {{being used as a}} wedge. Several birds have wrapped a piece of leaf around <b>a</b> <b>nut</b> to hold it in place. This behaviour is also shown by palm cockatoos (Probosciger aterrimus). It seems that the hyacinth macaw has an innate tendency to use tools during manipulation of nuts, as naïve juveniles tried out a variety of objects in combination with nuts.|$|E
25|$|Inspection of the {{finished}} screw threads can be achieved in various ways, with {{the expense of the}} method tailored to the requirements of the product application. Shop-floor inspection of a thread is often as simple as running <b>a</b> <b>nut</b> onto it (for male threads) or a bolt into it (for female threads). This is plenty good enough for many applications (e.g., MRO or hobbyist work), although it is not good enough for most commercial manufacturing. Higher-precision methods are discussed below.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{alternatives}} to DC motors are piezo motors or ultrasonic motors. These {{work on a}} fundamentally different principle, whereby tiny piezoceramic elements, vibrating many thousands of times per second, cause linear or rotary motion. There are different mechanisms of operation; one type uses the vibration of the piezo elements to step the motor in a circle or a straight line. Another type uses the piezo elements to cause <b>a</b> <b>nut</b> to vibrate or to drive a screw. The advantages of these motors are nanometer resolution, speed, and available force for their size. These motors are already available commercially, and being used on some robots.|$|E

25|$|In Norse mythology, {{the goddess}} Iðunn was the {{appointed}} keeper of golden apples {{that kept the}} Æsir young (or immortal) forever. Iðunn was abducted by Þjazi the giant, who used Loki to lure Iðunn and her apples out of Ásgarðr. The Æsir began to age without Iðunn's apples, so they coerced Loki into rescuing her. After borrowing Freyja's falcon skin, Loki liberated Iðunn from Þjazi by transforming her into <b>a</b> <b>nut</b> for the flight back. Þjazi gave chase {{in the form of}} an eagle, whereupon reaching Ásgarðr he was set aflame by a bonfire lit by the Æsir. With the return of Iðunn's apples, the Æsir regained their lost youth. Apple trees were the symbol of rebirth and beauty; the apple tree was sacred in Norse mythology.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} an etrog that is stolen or {{withered}} is invalid. If the larger {{part of it}} is covered with scars, or if its nipple is removed, if it is peeled, split, perforated, so that any part is missing, it is invalid. If only its lesser part is covered with scars, if its stalk was missing, or if it is perforated but nothing of it is missing, it is valid. A dark-colored etrog is invalid. If it is green as a leek, Rabbi Meir declares it valid and Rabbi Judah declares it invalid. Rabbi Meir taught that the minimum size of an etrog is that of <b>a</b> <b>nut.</b> Rabbi Judah taught that it is that of an egg. Rabbi Judah taught that the maximum size is such that two can be held in one hand. Rabbi Jose said even one that can be hold only in both hands.|$|E

25|$|A {{lockbolt}} is {{a fastener}} {{similar to a}} bolt in appearance and function. However, instead of using screw threads which connect to <b>a</b> <b>nut</b> using a turning motion, a lockbolt has annular grooves around the shaft of the bolt (pin). After placing the lockbolt in a hole, a threadless collar is forced at high pressures around the annular grooves, deforming the collar and permanently locking it into place around the grooves. Swaging is the generic term for setting a lockbolt and collar assembly. During the installation cycle of a lockbolt, the collar is deformed around the pin with locking grooves using special tooling. The tool engages onto the pintail, which is an extra portion of pin material protruding past the collar that the tool grabs and pulls. This force on the pintail pushes the joint together, and the conically-shaped cavity of the tooling is forced down the collar, which reduces its diameter and progressively swages the collar material into the grooves of the harder pin. As the force required for swaging increases during the process, the installation is finalised when the pintail breaks off.|$|E
