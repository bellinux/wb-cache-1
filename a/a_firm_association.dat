This is {{in agreement with the}} general model form substrate translocation, showing that energy in primary transport is not used to bind the substrate but to release it again from the buried counter ions. At the same time the N domain becomes exposed to the cytosol, ready for ATP exchange at the nucleotide-binding site.|$|E

40|$|Work from {{a number}} of {{laboratories}} has shown that fertilization is blocked in the presence of protease inhibitors, although the specific site of inhibition has not been identified. The present experiments were designed to discriminate between sperm binding to zonae pellucidae as opposed to sperm penetration through zonae, so as to assess the effect of protease inhibitors on these two distinct events. Exposure of capacitated mouse spermatozoa to a variety of protease inhibitors directed against trypsin blocked sperm binding to zonae in a concentration-dependent manner. A chymotrypsin-directed inhibitor was not capable of blocking sperm binding to zonae. The trypsin inhibitors did not affect sperm penetration though zonae nor gamete membrane fusion if the sperm had established <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> <b>association</b> with the zona surface before addition of the inhibitors. Previous incubation of zona-intact eggs with the inhibitors did not lead to a reduction in sperm binding, indicating that the activity affected by the inhibitors is borne by spermatozoa.

40|$|Eosinophil {{activating}} factor (EAF) is a 40 kD protein {{released from}} cultured, unstimulated human monocytes which enhances the IgG-dependent eosinophil-mediated cytotoxicity of helminthic larvae. We have recently shown that eosinophils elaborate substantial quantities of leukotriene C 4 (LTC 4) during incubation with IgG-coated particles and now report that EAF, partially purified by sequential chromatography on Sephacryl S- 200 and DEAE-cellulose, enhanced this IgG-dependent LTC 4 production by human eosinophils in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. LTC 4 production by normal density eosinophils, separated on discontinuous metrizamide gradients, was significantly increased after incubation with several dilutions of EAF (P less than 0. 05), although an increase was not seen with low density cells. The enhancement was similar in degree to that seen when normal density eosinophils were activated with the bacterial analogue, f-met-leu-phe (fMLP). EAF produced a time-dependent increase in LTC 4 which was significantly greater (P less than 0. 01) than the control.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{compare the}} {{prevalence}} of APC-resistance (APC-R) in patients with peripheral vascular disease and the general population. DesignProspective cohort examination. Materials and methodsThree hundred and eleven patients (group A) suffering from arterial occlusive disease or an abdominal aortic aneurysm were prospectively screened for APC-R. There were 228 men and 83 women {{with a mean age}} of 65 years (20 – 88 years). Two hundred and sixty patients underwent an open surgical or interventional procedure. A total of 306 patients were followed clinically for an average of 8 months (1 – 31 months). Two hundred and seven healthy volunteers (group B) served as a control group. ResultsThe prevalence of a functional APC-R was 11 % (33 / 311) and 8 % in groups A and B, respectively, (p= 0. 272). APC-R did not occur more frequently among patients who were treated primarily for a bypass occlusion (3 / 21 vs 30 / 290) (p= 0. 476). None of five patients who had a postinterventional graft or vessel occlusion (1. 9 %) had an APC-R. Sixteen patients (5 %) experienced an arterial occlusion during follow-up of which two had APC-R.

We examined this association within the EAGLE (Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology) study, a population-based case-control study conducted in Italy between 2002 and 2005. Methods: For men in selected occupations in the construction sector we calculated smoking-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). For bricklayers we estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) and the attributable community risk (ACR). Results: We found increased lung cancer risk for bricklayers (OR 1. 57, 95 % CI 1. 12 - 2. 21; 147 cases, 81 controls). The PAF was 3. 9 % (95 % CI 0. 7 - 7. 0), corresponding to an ACR of 4. 1 cases annually per 100, 000 men (95 % CI 0. 7 - 7. 3) in the whole community. Among bricklayers, there were increased risks for squamous cell (OR 2. 03, 95 % CI 1. 32 - 3. 13, 56 exposed cases) and small cell carcinomas (OR 2. 29, 95 % CI 1. 29 - 4. 07, 21 exposed cases), while no excess (OR 1. 06, 95 % CI 0. 68 - 1. 65, 41 exposed cases) was found for adenocarcinoma.

40|$|Background/Aims: The role of H. pylori in the {{pathogenesis}} of ulcer disease in cirrhotic patients is poorly defined. Therefore, we sought to investigate the prevalence of H. pylori infection and the occurrence of gastroduode-nal lesions in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods and Patients: Seroprevalence of H. pylori was tested in 110 patients with liver cirrhosis and 44 asymptomatic patients with chronic hepatitis without cirrhosis using an anti-H. pylori-IgG-ELISA. Cirrhotic patients underwent upper intestinal endoscopy for macroscopic and histological evaluation of gastric mucosa, and {{for the detection of}} mucosal colonisation of H. pylori using Giemsa staining and urease test. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} the H. pylori seroprevalence in patients with liver cirrhosis (76 / 110; 69 %) and patients with chronic viral hepatitis (27 / 44, 63 %, p= 0. 465). Gastric mucosal colonization with H. pylori in cirrhotic patients was significantly lower than the serologically determined H. pylori prevalence (45 % vs. 69 %, p= 0. 001). Etiology of liver cirrhosis did not influence the prevalence of H. pylori infection. 8 of 110 cirrhotic patients had gastric ulcers and 10 had duodenal ulcers. 61 % of cirrhotic patients with peptic ulcers were asymptomatic. H. pylori was histologically identified in 61 % of gastroduodenal ulcers, and 47 % of gastroduodenal erosions. Conclusions: Patients with liver cirrhosis have a high prevalence of gastroduodenal ulcers. The lack of <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> <b>association</b> between H. pylori prevalence and ulcer frequency in cirrhotic patients argues against a pivotal role of H. pylori in the etiology of ulcers in cirrhotic patients...|$|E
40|$|The recent IceCube {{discovery}} of 0. 1 - 1 PeV neutrinos of astrophysical origin {{opens up a}} new era for high-energy astrophysics. Although there are various astrophysical candidate sources, <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> <b>association</b> of the detected neutrinos with one (or more) of them is still lacking. A recent analysis of plausible astrophysical counterparts within the error circles of IceCube events showed that likely counterparts for nine of the IceCube neutrinos include mostly BL Lacs, among which Mrk 421. Motivated by this result and a previous independent analysis on the neutrino emission from Mrk 421, we test the BL Lac-neutrino connection {{in the context of}} a specific theoretical model for BL Lac emission. We model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the BL Lacs selected as counterparts of the IceCube neutrinos using a one-zone leptohadronic model and mostly nearly simultaneous data. The neutrino flux for each BL Lac is self-consistently calculated, using photon and proton distributions specifically derived for every individual source. We find that the SEDs of the sample, although different in shape and flux, are all well fitted by the model using reasonable parameter values. Moreover, the model-predicted neutrino flux and energy for these sources are of the same order of magnitude as those of the IceCube neutrinos. In two cases, namely Mrk 421 and H 1914 - 194, we find a suggestively good agreement between the model prediction and the detected neutrino flux. Our predictions for all the BL Lacs of the sample are in the range to be confirmed or disputed by IceCube in the next few years of data sampling.

40|$|CONTEXT: The phrase 2 ̆ 2 Science of Improvement 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Improvement Science 2 ̆ 2 is {{commonly}} used today by a range of people and professions to mean different things, creating confusion to those trying to learn about improvement. In this article, we briefly define the concepts of improvement and science, and review {{the history of the}} consideration of 2 ̆ 2 improvement 2 ̆ 2 as a science. METHODS: We trace key concepts and ideas in improvement to their philosophical and theoretical foundation with a focus on Deming 2 ̆ 7 s System of Profound Knowledge. We suggest that Deming 2 ̆ 7 s system has <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> <b>association</b> with many contemporary and historic philosophic and scientific debates and concepts. With reference to these debates and concepts, we identify 7 propositions that provide the scientific and philosophical foundation for the science of improvement. FINDINGS: A standard view of the science of improvement does not presently exist that is grounded in the philosophical and theoretical basis of the field. The 7 propositions outlined here demonstrate the value of examining the underpinnings of improvement. This is needed to both advance the field and minimize confusion about what the phrase 2 ̆ 2 science of improvement 2 ̆ 2 represents. We argue that advanced scientists of improvement are those who like Deming and Shewhart can integrate ideas, concepts, and models between scientific disciplines for the purpose of developing more robust improvement models, tools, and techniques with a focus on application and problem solving in real world contexts. CONCLUSIONS: The epistemological foundations and theoretical basis of the science of improvement and its reasoning methods need to be critically examined to ensure its continued development and relevance. If improvement efforts and projects in health care are to be characterized under the canon of science, then health care professionals engaged in quality improvement work would benefit from a standard set of core principles, a standard lexicon, and an understanding of the evolution of the science of improvement...|$|E

This binary was suggested to be the counterpart of AGL J 2241 + 4454, but this is still not <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> <b>association.</b> In this work we explore the archival AGILE and Fermi/LAT data in order to find more transient events originating in the field of AGL J 2241 + 4454 and address the possibility to link them to the accretion/ejection processes of MWC 656. We found a total of 9 other transient events with AGILE compatible with the position of AGL J 2241 + 4454, besides the one from 2010. We folded this events with the period of the binary system and we did not find significant results that allow us to associate the gamma-ray activity to any particular orbital phase. By stacking the 10 transient events we obtained a spectrum that extends between 100 MeV and 1 GeV, and we fitted it with a power law with photon index Γ = 2. 3 +/- 0. 2. We searched into the Fermi /LAT data in order to complement the gamma-ray information provided by AGILE but no significant results arose. In order to investigate this apparent contradiction between the two gamma-ray telescopes, we studied the exposure of the field of AGL J 2241 + 4454 in both instruments finding significant differences. In particular, AGILE exposed for longer time and at lower off-axis angle distance the field of AGL J 2241 + 4454. This fact, together with the energy dependent sensitivity of both instruments, and the soft spectrum found in the stacking analysis, might explain why AGILE observed the transient events not seen by Fermi/LAT.

A number of Herbig-Haro (HH) objects, including ones far to the west and east of the main ridge, are identified with H 2 knots. High-resolution spectroscopy in the ν = 1 - 0 S(1) line of 10 H 2 knots shows line profiles consistent with dual forward and reverse shocks. C-shock modeling suggest that asymmetries seen in suspected bow shocks could be evidence of varying magnetic field orientations throughout the cloud. One of the bow shocks in the H flow, YBD- 5, can be successfully modeled by a 100 km s - 1 C-shock propagating into a magnetized, 10 6 cm - 3 medium, although the observations and limitations within the computer code itself do not entirely rule out J-shocks. Mass spectra of the H flow are broken power laws, which might be evidence for a jet that has two entrainment mechanisms for accelerating ambient molecular gas into the outflow. The H 2 luminosity in this flow is many times smaller than the CO mechanical luminosity, but this fact cannot rule out the possibility that a narrow highly collimated jet drives the molecular outflow, owing to uncertainties in extinction, outflow dynamic times, cooling contributions from other lines, and the wind model used. Outflows from OMC- 2 / 3 are likely to contribute to the turbulent pumping of gas within the molecular ridge north of the Orion Nebula. High-velocity gas clumps north of the sources investigated here may represent evidence of additional undiscovered outflows from young stars...|$|E

Are comprehensive business groups side-lined on salient issues, because firms chose to lobby on their own? How do firms pursue their interests in a multi-level policy? To answer these questions, we have selected 14 recent EU policy issues that have been particularly salient to the firms in the sector to which the proposed legislation would apply. We have then studied the ten largest firms in each affected sector, their national business associations and the most relevant EU associations, a total of 136 <b>firms</b> and 115 <b>associations,</b> of which 80 are national and 35 are EU-groups. To gather information on the ways in which firms tried to represent their interests, we have conducted a newspaper search for each policy issue and surveyed all articles that associated the policy issue with the name of <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> or <b>association</b> to find information about lobbying activities. Such a newspaper survey certainly does not reveal all political activities of the firms in question, but it helps to distinguish when and how firms are becoming active on their own behalf and when they choose to remain less visible...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{central nervous}} system (CNS) tumors cause {{significant}} morbidity and mortality in both adults and children. While some of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of neuro-oncogenesis are known, much less is known about possible epigenetic contributions to disease pathophysiology. Over the last several decades, chronic viral infections {{have been associated with}} a number of human malignancies. In primary CNS malignancies, two families of viruses, namely polyomavirus and herpesvirus, have been detected with varied frequencies in a number of pediatric and adult histological tumor subtypes. However, establishing a link between chronic viral infection and primary CNS malignancy has been an area of considerable controversy, due in part to variations in detection frequencies and methodologies used among researchers. Since a latent viral neurotropism can be seen with a variety of viruses and a widespread seropositivity exists among the population, it has been difficult to establish an association between viral infection and CNS malignancy based on epidemiology alone. While direct evidence of a role of viruses in neuro-oncogenesis in humans is lacking, a more plausible hypothesis of neuro-oncomodulation has been proposed. The overall goals of this review are to summarize the many human investigations that have studied viral infection in primary CNS tumors, discuss potential neuro-oncomodulatory mechanisms of viral-associated CNS disease and propose future research directions to establish <b>a</b> more <b>firm</b> <b>association</b> between chronic viral infections and primary CNS malignancies...|$|R
40|$|The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) defines an {{independent}} contractor as "any person, partnership, corporation, subsidiary of <b>a</b> corporation, <b>firm,</b> <b>association</b> or other organization that contracts to perform services or construction at a mine. " Contractors that perform {{specific types of}} work are required to report {{the number of employees}} who perform work at coal mines and at noncoal mines. In 2002, a total of 2, 820 contracting companies reported employment at coal mines to MSHA. A total of 30, 332 coal contractor employees, corresponding to 16, 795 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, were reported to MSHA in 2002. This represents an 8. 4 % decrease in FTE coal contractor employees from 2001. Seven work-related fatalities occurred among coal contractor employees in 2002, compared to six in 2001. There were 641 nonfatal lost-time injuries among coal contractor employees occurring at a rate of 3. 8 injuries per 100 FTEs in 2002. A total of 36, 347 days lost from work resulted from these injuries. Eighteen cases of occupational illness in coal contractor employees were reported to MSHA in 2002. There were four cases of systemic poisoning; three cases each of hearing impairment, black lung (coal workers' pneumoconiosis), and unclassified occupational diseases; two cases of joint, tendon, or muscle inflammation or irritation; and one case each of dermatitis, heat stroke, and other injury.
