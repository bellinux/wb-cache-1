5|$|Denver {{lies within}} the semi-arid, {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen climate classification BSk). It has four distinct seasons and receives a modest <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> {{spread throughout the}} year. Due to its inland location on the High Plains, {{at the foot of}} the Rocky Mountains, Denver, like all cities along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains, is subject to sudden changes in weather. Contrary to the popular belief that Denver receives 300 days of sunshine a year, the city can actually expect to receive an average of 115 clear days, 130 partly cloudy days, and 120 cloudy days each year.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, Peveril Meigs divided desert regions on Earth {{into three}} {{categories}} according to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> they received. In this now widely accepted system, extremely arid lands have at least twelve consecutive months without precipitation, arid lands have less than 250mm (10in) of annual precipitation, and semiarid lands have a mean annual precipitation of between 250 and 500mm (10–20in). Both extremely arid and arid lands {{are considered to be}} deserts while semiarid lands are generally referred to as steppes when they are grasslands.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} trough produced {{heavy rainfall}} across the western Caribbean Sea, which on Cuba unofficially reached over 7.8inches (200mm). Outer rainbands in Pinar del Río Province injured three people and damaged 55houses. In Florida, Barry dropped a moderate <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> across the drought-ridden state; rainfall peaked at 6.99inches (178mm). The rain caused some flooding and wet roads, {{which led to}} two indirect traffic fatalities. Rough seas killed one Florida surfer in Pinellas County. In Florida and Georgia, the precipitation assisted firefighters in combating severe wildfires. Overall damage from the storm was minor.|$|E
5|$|Trade winds blow {{from east}} to west across the Hawaiian islands, and the {{presence}} of Mauna Loa strongly affects the local climate. At low elevations, the eastern (windward) side of the volcano receives heavy rain; the city of Hilo is the wettest in the United States. The rainfall supports extensive forestation. The western (leeward) side has a much drier climate. At higher elevations, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> decreases, and skies are very often clear. Very low temperatures mean that precipitation often occurs in the form of snow, and the summit of Mauna Loa is described as a periglacial region, where freezing and thawing {{play a significant role in}} shaping the landscape.|$|E

5|$|Some scientists, {{including}} Kerry Emanuel and Lakshmi Kantha, {{have criticized}} the scale as being simplistic, indicating that the scale takes into account neither the physical size of a storm nor the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> it produces. Additionally, they and others {{point out that the}} Saffir–Simpson scale, unlike the Richter scale used to measure earthquakes, is not continuous, and is quantized into a small number of categories. Proposed replacement classifications include the Hurricane Intensity Index, which is based on the dynamic pressure caused by a storm's winds, and the Hurricane Hazard Index, which is based on surface wind speeds, the radius of maximum winds of the storm, and its translational velocity. Both of these scales are continuous, akin to the Richter scale; however, neither of these scales have been used by officials.|$|E
5|$|Paralleling the coastline, {{the storm}} {{produced}} a light storm surge that peaked at 2.6feet (0.8m) above normal on Sanibel Island. In some locations, the surge rose rapidly, and, despite the unusual {{geography of the}} area, the levels varied only {{by as much as}} 9.8inches (250mm) than the predicted levels from the SLOSH model. The surge and waves caused minor beach erosion. Moderate to heavy rainfall fell across western Florida, peaking at 6.14 inches (156 mm) near Bradenton; the rainfall was beneficial after a very dry summer, though, because it fell quickly, even this <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> failed to relieve water restrictions across the area. The storm resulted in some flooding in its path, including some several homes in Manatee County, roadways, and two U.S. highways. Statewide damage totalled $3 million (1990 USD, $  USD), of which $1 million (1990 USD, $  USD) occurred in Manatee County.|$|E

Despite its location on the relatively dryer east side of Vancouver Island, the resulting weak rain shadow is not enough to keep the city dry.|$|E
25|$|Under the Köppen climate classification, Hartley Bay {{features}} an Oceanic climate with chilly winters and mild summers. The area receives copious <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> {{throughout the course}} of the year averaging roughly 4500mm of precipitation annually.

25|$|Despite the {{potential}} diversity of climates in the ET category involving precipitation, extreme temperatures, and relative {{wet and dry}} seasons, this category is rarely subdivided. Rainfall and snowfall are generally slight due to the low vapor pressure {{of water in the}} chilly atmosphere, but as a rule potential evapotranspiration is extremely low, allowing soggy terrain of swamps and bogs even in places that get precipitation typical of deserts of lower and middle latitudes. The amount of native tundra biomass depends more on the local temperature than the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Starting from June 24, {{officials}} in Varna began evacuating around 250 Asparuhovo residents from 85 buildings deemed {{too dangerous to}} live in, including at least 11 that would be demolished immediately. Due to the extreme <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation,</b> measures were taken to stabilize parts of the hillside {{in the area for}} fears it might collapse in a landslide. Water service was fully restored to Asparuhovo on June 25, although officials announced they will continue to monitor the chemical composition of water within the city of Varna for at least a few weeks. By June 27, the number of evacuation orders in Asparuhovo had risen to 132, covering more than 1,000 residents of the neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|The northwest-southeast {{alignment}} of Zagros Mountains forms {{the terrain of}} the area. The two important mountain ridges are Kabir Kuh and Dinar Kuh. Being located in the western-most part of Zagross Mountains gives the province its special landscape including deserts in the western counties of Mehran and Dehloran bordering Iraq which feature very hot summers and mild winters and very low precipitations and the mountainous regions of east like Abdanan and Darreh Shahr which are milder and receive higher precipitations, mostly in form of rain, although snow is not rare. The northern region of Ilam, due to its altitude, experiences cold winters and mild summers and receives the highest <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> in the province.

50|$|Precipitation {{increases}} {{from east}} to west in most areas. Elevation {{plays an important role in}} the Caucasus and mountains generally receive higher <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> than low-lying areas. The northeastern regions (Dagestan) and the southern portions of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains are the driest. The absolute minimum annual precipitation is 250 mm in the northeastern Caspian Depression. Western parts of the Caucasus Mountains are marked by high <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation.</b> The southern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range receive higher <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> than the northern slopes. Annual precipitation in the Western Caucasus ranges from 1000 to(-) 4000 mm while in the Eastern and Northern Caucasus (Chechnya, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Ossetia, Kakheti, Kartli, etc.) precipitation ranges from 600 to(-) 1800 mm. The absolute maximum annual precipitation is 4100 mm around the Mt. Mtirala area which lies on the Meskheti Range in Ajaria. The <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> the Lesser Caucasus Mountain Range (Southern Georgia, Armenia, western Azerbaijan), not including the Meskheti Range, varies from 300-800 mm annually.|$|R
25|$|The {{winter in}} Seoul is {{controlled}} by the large Siberian high pressure system (the Asiatic high), which results in predominantly cold, dry north-westerly winds. The influence of the Siberian high leads to significantly colder winter temperatures than would be expected at this latitude. About every 4 to 6 days a low-pressure trough will move through South Korea, bringing with it cloudiness and light precipitation. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> locally depends mostly on the elevation of the station and the length of time that the air has been over the Yellow Sea. Maximum snowfall occurs over the northwest coast, which is the most exposed to the northwesterly flow, and in the mountain areas. Normally less than 10 percent of the annual precipitation falls during the winter. Frequently the weather is cloudless, clear, and dry, except for the southwestern region of the peninsula. The mean January temperature in Seoul is -2.4°C (27°F). January, is the coldest month in Seoul.|$|E
25|$|The annual {{rainfall}} regime {{is generated by}} two factors: general atmospheric circulation, physical and geographical conditions, respectively. Advection of temperate oceanic air from west and north-west direction, especially during the summer, as well as frequent ingress of cold air masses from the north or those temperate continental from north-east and east, during the winter, plus advection of maritime tropical air from the south-west and south, explain all influences of atmospheric action centres which are felt in this area. Taking into account these elements, plus relief influences, atmospheric rainfall are unevenly spread across the county. The average <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> is 600–700mm, in Zalău being 634.2mm (calculated for the period 1961–1990). The most abundant precipitation falls in summer, when besides frontal processes occurs the intense thermal convection, causing showers, rich in terms of quantity. During the winter, rainfall is less quantitatively, {{although the number of}} days with precipitation is not smaller. By and large, the pluviometric maximum overlaps the months of May–June, and the pluviometric minimum is registered in January–February.|$|E
25|$|The average {{precipitation}} in Bulgaria is about 670mm. It is uneven {{in terms of}} seasons and territory. In northern Bulgaria the highest precipitation is in May–June, while in southern Bulgaria it is in winter. The average <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> also varies in term of altitude— from 450–850mm in the plains to 850–1200mm. The lowest mean precipitation is {{in the eastern part}} of Dobrudzha and the Burgas Plain (450mm) and in the area between Plovdiv and Pazardzhik (500mm); the highest rainfall falls in the mountains— the Petrohan Pass in the western Balkan Mountains and Zlatograd in the Rhodope Mountains. The highest annual rainfall was measured in 1957 in the upper valley of the river Ogosta in the western Balkan Mountains (2293mm); the highest daily rainfall was recorded at Saints Constantine and Helena resort (342mm) near Varna in 1951. The total annual amount of the rainfall is 74 billion km3; of them 70% evaporate, 20% flow into the rivers and 10% soak into the soil. Most of the country is affected by droughts in June and August. The snow cover lasts from 20–30 days in the lowlands to 9 months in the highest mountains.|$|E
40|$|Torrential rains fall {{during the}} warm season {{due to the}} {{intensification}} of the Azores Anticyclone activity, and the Atlantic and Mediterranean cyclone. Fundamental processes {{that lead to the}} development of cloud formations capable <b>of</b> producing large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> are, as it is known, convection and turbulent exchanges inside air masses. Summer rainfall in Dobrudja is of frontal nature and usually occurs during the day as showers. The correlation curve between the distance to the Black Sea of the pluviometric points and the maximum daily <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> (24 hours) fallen during each of the summer months has a similar aspect to that <b>of</b> the average <b>precipitation</b> quantities on the Dobrudja territory during the warm period of the year (April-October) (Mihăilescu, 2001). Maximum <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> rainfall (24 hours) decrease gradually from the land, from a distance of 30 - 35 km,with a tendency to reach the lowest values on the Black Sea littoral. The significant correlation coefficient between the distance to the sea and the maximum daily <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> (24 hours) confirms their obvious influence on precipitation distribution in Dobrudj...|$|R
30|$|Horizontally {{oriented}} {{surfaces are}} exposed to higher <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> than vertically oriented ones.
