The first part focuses on theoretical causes of crises, possibilities of their prevention and <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> anticipate <b>coming</b> economic problems. The work deals with the study of Argentina's systemic crisis in the second section. We can observe on historical emergence of economy and behaviour its representatives that country had conditions leading to depression for long time. The work tries to answer questions like whether government was able to avoid the crisis and why its economic incidences were so catastrophical. The extend of the adverse effects is shown on main macroenomic indicators by the help of tables and graphs...|$|R

Surgery is rarely indicated in the majority of the patients with vertigo. Surgical solutions should be proposed for cases of chronic incapacitating vertigo that are refractory to medical or physical treatment.

50|$|It is {{strongly}} implied that Gregory {{is in fact}} a manifestation of the hidden dreams and desires that people suppress, and his hotel the same. Although how several different people can manifest the exact same apparition is unknown, and it is highly probable that Gregory {{is in fact a}} spirit of dreams and desires, instead of a single person's manifestation. Gregory's aims seem unclear in both the game and the series, but he seems to be subservient to his mother, who is thoroughly and unambiguously wicked, unlike Gregory, consuming wayward souls to remain young. Gregory himself is more morally ambiguous, since he never overtly harms the guest, though he never makes any <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> prevent harm <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> them. This may be because everyone in the hotel is effectively immortal, however.|$|R
25|$|Paramount <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> use the <b>coming</b> {{of sound}} films to {{pressure}} the actress, but she called the studio's bluff. It was not until 30 years later that this rebellious move would come {{to be seen as}} arguably the most savvy of her career, securing her immortality as a silent film legend and independent spirit. Unfortunately, while her initial snubbing of Paramount alone would not have finished her in Hollywood altogether, her refusal after returning from Germany to come back to Paramount for sound retakes of The Canary Murder Case (1929) irrevocably placed her on an unofficial blacklist. Actress Margaret Livingston was hired to dub Brooks's voice for the film, as the studio claimed that Brooks' voice was unsuitable for sound pictures.|$|R

Mitral, having been abandoned in its unstable state by the Ketars, was going to explode within four hours, and the explosion would take Evath with it. Skerrit's mission was to use the excavation probe [...] "Last Hope" [...] to place eighteen drilling rigs around Mitral to allow the gas to dissipate harmlessly into space and prevent this disaster. Things are not so simple though, with the security systems activated prior to the Ketars' departure.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Let G be a connected, semisimple Lie {{group with}} finite center and let K be a maximal compact subgroup. We {{investigate}} {{a method to}} compute multiplicities of K-types in the discrete series using a rational expression for a generating function obtained from Blattner’s formula. This expression involves a product with a character of an irreducible finite dimensional representation of K and is valid for any discrete series system. Other results include a new proof of a symmetry of Blattner’s formula, and a positivity result for certain low rank examples. We consider in detail the situation for G of type split G 2.

40|$|Hacker {{attacks on}} {{computer}} networks are well known, but Private Branch Exchange (PBX) systems are also vulnerable. In one case, a hacker penetrated the Private Branch Exchange (PBX) system {{operated by a}} hospital in Escondido, California. For nearly two years, on various occasions, he blocked calls {{to and from the}} hospital, connected hospital operators to spurious numbers (including the county jail), and placed bogus emergency calls that appeared <b>to</b> be <b>coming</b> from <b>inside</b> the hospital. Unfortunately, the hospital’s experience is not unique. Failure to secure a PBX system can result in exposing an organization to toll fraud, theft of proprietary, personal, and confidential information, loss of revenue, or legal entanglements. Depending on how the organization’s network is configured and administered, information leading to intrusions of data networks may be compromised as well. A PBX is a sophisticated computer-based switch that {{can be thought of as}} essentially a small, in-house phone company for the organization that operates it. Protection of the PBX is thus a high priority. This bulletin introduces some of the vulnerabilities of PBX switches and describes some countermeasures that can be used to increase the security of your PBX. For a more detailed treatment o...|$|R

40|$|The General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO), the {{archetype}} of Ocean Mapping at a world-ocean scale, celebrated its centenary {{last year with}} the release of an updated and greatly enhanced Digital Atlas. This CD contains gridded soundings and contours, the culmination of one hundred years of successful blending of hydrography and oceanography. This reflects the creative co-operation of both organisations such as the International Hydrographic Organisation and Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission and those working side by side at individual level: hydrographers, geologists and geophysicists each contributing their different skills. This major accomplishment also represents the first step into the next hundred years. In this paper {{the new chairman of the}} GEBCO Guiding Committee <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> envision how <b>coming</b> changes in science and technology, organisations and society, as well as some conceptual shifts, will influence GEBCO and, indeed, all seafloor mapping over the next few years...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the design and the {{implementation}} of a prototype for supporting a user through the navigation in a web-site. We exploit the potentiality of having a representation of an hypermedia based on the concept of an abstract semantic description of the knowledge tree, in order to use some adaptivity processes, typical of many hypermedia systems, without the limitation of having a fixed set of resources. Our prototype was implemented for the archaeological Herculaneum Excavations, but the novelty of this work is an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> combine methodologies <b>coming</b> from Adaptive Hypermedia, Recommendation Systems and SemanticWeb {{in order to have a}} context-independent approach for Hypermedia on theWeb. What we propose is an architecture with modules that can be reused and adapted in many different contexts. In order to have a context independent behavior the system was implemented with a structural adaptivity itself. This means that changing the tree the system adapts itself to the modifications and dynamically regenerates the code of its components...|$|R

A region {{in the midst of}} Africa, called Aerial by the English explorers who found it, made a perfect spot. The region was a paradise valley surrounded by high mountains, thus unreachable by any conventional vessel - except the air-ship. In that paradise, Arnold and Natasha finally swore their love to each other, agreeing to prolong their longing passion until the war to end all wars is over and eternal peace restored on Earth. In the meantime, Terrorists built eleven more air-ships identical to Ariel and the twelfth - a flagship - with twice the firepower and the size.|$|R
