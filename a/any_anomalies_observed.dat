40|$|The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) {{mandated}} {{utilizing the}} Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) approach for all new bridges initiated in the United States after October 1, 2007. To achieve {{part of this}} goal, a database for Drilled Shaft Foundation Testing (DSHAFT) was developed and reported on by Garder, Ng, Sritharan, and Roling in 2012. DSHAFT is aimed at assimilating high-quality drilled shaft test data from Iowa and the surrounding regions. DSHAFT is currently housed on a project website ([URL] and contains data for 41 drilled shaft tests. The objective {{of this research was}} to utilize the DSHAFT database and develop a regional LRFD procedure for drilled shafts in Iowa with preliminary resistance factors using a probability-based reliability theory. This was done by examining current design and construction practices used by the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) as well as recommendations given in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) LRFD Bridge Design Specifications and the FHWA drilled shaft guidelines. Various analytical methods were used to estimate side resistance and end bearing of drilled shafts in clay, sand, intermediate geomaterial (IGM), and rock. Since most of the load test results obtained from O-cell do not pass the 1 -in. top displacement criterion used by the Iowa DOT and the 5 % of shaft diameter for top displacement criterion recommended by AASHTO, three improved procedures are proposed to generate and extend equivalent top load-displacement curves that enable the quantification of measured resistances corresponding to the displacement criteria. Using the estimated and measured resistances, regional resistance factors were calibrated following the AASHTO LRFD framework and adjusted to resolve <b>any</b> <b>anomalies</b> <b>observed</b> among the factors. To illustrate the potential and successful use of drilled shafts in Iowa, the design procedures of drilled shaft foundations were demonstrated and the advantages of drilled shafts over driven piles were addressed in two case studies...|$|E

The project seeks {{to create a new}} assistance system for mentally disabled people or people with reduced mobility (Stikic et al., PervasiveHealth 2008, Second International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare, 2008) [1] using S. H. E. L. L. Personal Kit: a Secure Habitat for an Enhanced Long Living Personal Kit, a series of environmental devices that should be stationary and easy to use and implement and a modular system. The aim is to turn them into mass products. The S. H. E. L. L. Personal Kit is made up of an smart wearable device, a tablet docking station and a series of environmental elements for localization and to receive/transmit data. The principal goal of the project is enhancing safety and autonomy for its users through automatic alarms, integrated in a wireless sensor net. The system can detect specific habits of the people that are being monitored, thus allowing them to move freely in their surroundings.

40|$|Tropical Pacific–high {{southern}} latitude teleconnections are {{shown to be}} caused by Rossby wave dynamics and are sensitive to the exact pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies forcing anomalous ascent. Further, the signal becomes obscured by local natural variability at higher {{southern latitude}}s. Here it is shown that a Rossby wave with a source in the tropical Pacific can explain the general pattern of teleconnection found during the southern winter. Upper level divergence associated with deep convection in the tropical Pacific {{plays a major role in}} the generation of these Rossby waves. SST anomalies associated with El Niño/Southern Oscillation force the tropical deep convection. However, the relationship between deep convection and SST anomalies is complex and modeling experiments show that in areas of large-scale subsidence positive SST anomalies would have to be larger than <b>any</b> <b>observed</b> <b>anomalies</b> (> 4 °C) before they have any effect on the vertical motion. Large variations are observed between the high-latitude response to El Niño with apparently similar tropical forcings. This makes accurate prediction of the high-latitude response to tropical change difficult. Ensemble GCM runs show that variations due to the natural variation of the zonal flow in the Southern Hemisphere can swamp the signal resulting from changes in the Rossby wave source region...|$|R

Detailed attention is given to the relevant oxygen reactions, Al- 26 production, and effects of proton irradiation on isotopes of Mg, Ca, and Ba.
