500|$|Literature scholar Tonia Payne {{has written}} that [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] {{is an example of}} ecocriticism, wherein Le Guin critiques the idea that human beings are {{separate}} from their natural environment. The premise of the novella involves human beings who live their entire lives on a ship in interstellar space, and who therefore have to create <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>reality</b> for themselves, a notion also explored in Le Guin's short story [...] "Newton's Sleep". The inhabitants of Discovery become unable to relate to representations of Earth. Some, like Hsing and Luis, still try to understand Ti Chiu, keeping in mind their position {{as a part of a}} continuum of people supposed to colonize a new planet. For others, this new reality takes the form of the religious beliefs of the cult of Bliss. These beliefs are portrayed as an understandable attempt to adjust to the reality of spaceflight. A review by Publishers Weekly identified a similar theme, common to the other stories in the [...] "Birthday of the World" [...] collection, of characters coming to terms with the world they live in.|$|E
500|$|The Boom {{novels are}} {{essentially}} modernist novels. [...] They treat time as nonlinear, often use {{more than one}} perspective or narrative voice and feature {{a great number of}} neologisms (the coining of new words or phrases), puns and even profanities. [...] As Pope writes, in reference to the style of the Boom: [...] "It relied on a Cubist superposition of different points of view, it made time and lineal progress questionable, and it was technically complex. Linguistically self assured, it used the vernacular without apologies." [...] Other notable characteristics of the Boom include the treatment of both [...] "rural and urban settings", internationalism, an emphasis on both the historical and the political, as well as [...] "questioning of regional as well as, or more than, national identity; awareness of hemisphereic as well as worldwide economic and ideological issues; polemicism; and timeliness." [...] Boom literature breaks down the barriers between the fantastical and the mundane, transforming this mixture into <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>reality.</b> [...] Of the Boom writers, Gabriel García Márquez is most closely {{associated with the use of}} magical realism; indeed, he is credited with bringing it [...] "into vogue" [...] after the publishing of One Hundred Years of Solitude in 1967.|$|E
