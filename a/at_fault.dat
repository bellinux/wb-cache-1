30|$|Evaluations of the {{proposed}} relay operation/fault detection time and reach setting were performed <b>at</b> <b>faults</b> near boundary in the 4.1 and 4.2 respectively. Proposed scheme was also verified using various faulted conditions like faults close to boundaries with high fault resistance, changeable faults inception angles. These test results were presented in following sub-sections.|$|R
50|$|Subduction usually occurs <b>at</b> {{convergent}} <b>fault</b> lines. The underlying {{tectonic plate}} descends, or subducts, into the Earth's mantle.

5|$|After TransNet was renewed in November 2004, {{planning}} {{continued for}} widening the remaining portion of SR76 west of I-15, {{due to the}} frequent accidents that occurred on the eastern portion, although some claimed that the habits of drivers were <b>at</b> <b>fault.</b> The 2007 environmental impact report recommended constructing the new roadway along {{the route of the}} old one, rather than moving the entire highway south.|$|E
5|$|Captain Joseph Miceli, {{assigned}} by the Navy to lead the technical investigation into the explosion, had supervised the preparation of powder and shells used in Iowa's 16-inch guns. Thus, according to Thompson, Miceli had {{a conflict of interest}} in ensuring that the powder, ammunition, or guns were not <b>at</b> <b>fault</b> in the explosion. After being briefed on the NIS's focus on Hartwig, Miceli directed his investigative team to determine how Hartwig had initiated the explosion using an electrical or chemical detonator.|$|E
5|$|Drysdale also {{oversaw the}} first civil {{litigation}} trial, {{in which the}} owners of the two ships sought damages from each other. His decision (27 April 1918) found Mont-Blanc entirely <b>at</b> <b>fault.</b> Subsequent appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada (19 May 1919), and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London (22 March 1920), determined Mont-Blanc and Imo were equally to blame for navigational errors that led to the collision. No party was ever convicted for any crime or otherwise successfully prosecuted for any actions that precipitated the disaster.|$|E

5|$|Of the 314 {{personnel}} aboard Voyager at {{the time}} of the collision, 14 officers, 67 sailors, and 1 civilian dockyard worker were killed, including Stevens and all but two of the bridge team. A Royal Commission into the events of the collision was held in 1964, and found that while Voyager was primarily <b>at</b> <b>fault</b> for neglecting to maintain an effective lookout and awareness of the larger ship's location, Melbournes bridge crew was also <b>at</b> <b>fault,</b> for failing to alert Voyager and not taking measures to avoid the collision. Robertson was posted to the training base —a move that he and the Australian media saw as tantamount to a demotion—but resigned instead. The Royal Commission and its aftermath were poorly handled, and following pressure from the public, media, and politicians, combined with revelations by Voyagers former executive officer that Stevens may have been unfit for command, a second Royal Commission was opened in 1967. This is the only time in Australian history two Royal Commissions have been held for a single incident. The second commission found that Stevens was medically unfit for command and that some of the findings of the first Royal Commission were therefore based on incorrect assumptions. Robertson and the other officers of Melbourne were absolved of blame for the incident.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy {{was first}} {{identified}} {{as a form of}} theodicy by John Hick in Evil and the God of Love, written in 1966. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, which is based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, which casts God as responsible for evil but justified in it. The Irenaean theodicy is distinguished by its acceptance that God is responsible for evil, but that he is not <b>at</b> <b>fault.</b>|$|E

Sellers wrote that a standard mahogany board weighs around thirteen and half pounds but the one used in Crookes' experiment may have been <b>at</b> <b>fault</b> at only six pounds. Crookes responded to Sellers claiming the board weighed six pounds and {{this was not a}} mistake, he also stated he had the board for about sixteen years and it was originally cut in a lumber yard.|$|E

5|$|After {{the slave}} ship reached port at Black River, Jamaica, Zongs owners made {{a claim to}} their {{insurers}} {{for the loss of}} the slaves. When the insurers refused to pay, the resulting court cases (Gregson v Gilbert (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232) held that in some circumstances, the deliberate killing of slaves was legal and that insurers could be required to pay for the slaves' deaths. The judge, Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, ruled against the syndicate owners in this case, due to new evidence being introduced suggesting the captain and crew were <b>at</b> <b>fault.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gunn made six full {{international}} appearances for Scotland, conceding 10 goals. He was {{a member}} of the squad for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, but played in none of Scotland's three matches at the tournament, as he was third-choice goalkeeper behind Jim Leighton and Andy Goram. He made his Scotland debut in a pre-tournament friendly match against Egypt, but was <b>at</b> <b>fault</b> for two Egyptian goals, resulting in a 3–1 defeat for Scotland. The embarrassment was made worse by the fact that his parents were watching. Gunn made four appearances for Scotland in 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. His last cap was as a second-half substitute in a 3–1 friendly defeat by the Netherlands in May 1994.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{crossed the}} line to win his second race of the season, with Rosberg {{following}} him home in 2nd and Vettel completing the podium with 3rd. Pastor Maldonado had an eventful race. On lap 33, while running in seventh position ahead of teammate Romain Grosjean, he missed the pit entry and lost time, dropping several positions. He then proceeded to spin his car on lap 39 as he attempted {{to make up for}} lost time, and on lap 48 he had a collision with Jenson Button following a long battle for position, damaging his car and retiring with rear brake failure a few laps later. The stewards later deemed Button to be <b>at</b> <b>fault</b> for the incident.|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for designing sequential circuits which are totally self-checking for single stuck <b>at</b> <b>faults</b> is presented. This technique uses m-out-of-n codes for state assignments and for output encoding. The next stage logic and the output logic are implemented such that any stuck-at-fault will either create a single bit error or unidirectional multibit error at the output. The technique {{has been applied}} to MCNC benchmark circuits and the overhead is estimated...|$|R
50|$|Researchers {{have found}} that jurors believe {{previously}} abused or intellectually disabled defendants are less receptive to rehabilitation, and that disabled juveniles should be held <b>at</b> less <b>fault</b> than non-disabled juveniles for crimes committed.

40|$|Abstract. Current paper aims at {{improving}} the test generation at registertransfer level by proposing a new functional fault model as a complement to the hierarchical model to target single-stuck <b>at</b> <b>faults</b> in hierarchical designs. Experiments on different sequential benchmarks {{show that the}} new fault model allows to significantly increase the accuracy of hierarchical test generation in comparison to traditional approaches. Very high fault coverages are achieved for sequential designs, whose sizes exceed 1000 gates. ...|$|R
5|$|Hansell's first duty {{assignment}} {{was with the}} 2nd Bombardment Group at Langley Field, testing repaired aircraft. In June 1930, he spent three months temporary duty with the 6th Field Artillery at Fort Hoyle, Maryland. In September 1930, he returned to Langley Field and was detached to the Air Corps Tactical School as armament officer. While stationed at Langley, Hansell was involved in two minor accidents in aircraft he was piloting, and in early 1931 was forced to parachute to safety when his Boeing P-12 stalled during a test flight, going into an unrecoverable spin. He was found <b>at</b> <b>fault</b> for the accident and initially charged $10,000 by the Air Corps for {{the expense of the}} aircraft, but the cost was eventually written off.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 Michael filed a {{malpractice}} {{suit against}} Terri's obstetrician {{on the basis}} that he failed to diagnose bulimia as the cause of her infertility. Terri had gone to the doctor because she had stopped menstruating but the doctor had failed to take her medical history into account which might have revealed an eating disorder. During the case, one of Terri's friends testified that she knew Schiavo was bulimic. In November 1992, Michael won the case and was awarded $6.8 million by the jury, later reduced to $2 million as Terri was found partly <b>at</b> <b>fault</b> for her condition. After attorneys' fees and other expenses, Michael received $300,000 and $750,000 was put in a trust fund for Terri's medical care. According to Michael, in early 2003 the Schindlers demanded that he share the malpractice money with them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} inquiry, chaired by Rear Admiral Reinhold von Werner, Monts {{testified that he}} had not been given {{sufficient}} time to familiarize himself with the ship and its crew, who were themselves unfamiliar with the vessel. Monts argued that the mobilization process for the newly commissioned ship should have lasted four to six weeks, rather than the three he had been given. The day before the squadron left Wilhelmshaven, Batsch complained to General Albrecht von Stosch, the chief of the Kaiserliche Marine, that a significant number of dockyard workers were still finishing work on Grosser Kurfürst. Werner and the board determined that Admiral Batsch was <b>at</b> <b>fault</b> and exonerated Monts.|$|E

5|$|Parliament is {{not bound}} by the common law, {{and as a result}} several acts of {{parliament}} unwittingly create valid exceptions to the doctrine of privity. Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, motorists are obliged to take out third party liability insurance. This means that victims of car accidents can claim money from the insurer of the driver <b>at</b> <b>fault,</b> even though they {{are not part of the}} original contract. Under the Married Women's Property Act 1882 a husband can take out insurance in his own name, but make it enforceable by his wife and children despite the doctrine of privity.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is called}} Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake, {{named after the}} United States President {{who presided over the}} authorization and completion of the dam. Creation of the reservoir forced the relocation of over 3,000 people, including Native Americans whose ancestral lands were partially flooded. While the dam does not contain fish-ladders, neither does the next down-stream dam, Chief Joseph Dam. This means that no salmon ever reach the Grand Coulee Dam, rendering the possibility of added fish-ladders superfluous. Despite this, the second large dam down-stream, Rocky Reach Dam, does contains an intricate system of fish ladders to accommodate yearly salmon spawning. Being itself 473 miles upstream of the mouth of the Columbia River, there is currently no issue with salmon spawning that Grand Coulee or Chief Joseph dams are <b>at</b> <b>fault</b> for.|$|E
5|$|West Germany awaited in {{the final}} at Wembley, and they took the lead through Helmut Haller on 12 minutes; Charlton felt {{that he could have}} blocked the shot but at the time he {{believed}} that Banks had it covered, though it was Wilson who was <b>at</b> <b>fault</b> for allowing Haller the chance to shoot. England came back and took the lead, but with only a few minutes left in the game Charlton gave away a free kick after fouling Uwe Seeler whilst competing for an aerial ball; Wolfgang Weber scored the equalising goal from a goalmouth scramble created from the free kick. Geoff Hurst scored two goals in extra-time to win the game 4–2.|$|E

30|$|More importantly, Fig.  6 and Table  2 {{show that}} {{the average of the}} {{magnitudes}} of the ROCOF caused by the <b>fault</b> <b>at</b> different <b>fault</b> locations increases with the dispersion of the distribution of the inertia contributions. It can be seen from Fig.  6 and Table  2 that when the <b>fault</b> occurs <b>at</b> bus 30, 33, 35, or 36, the magnitude of the ROCOF reduces with the increase in the dispersion of the distribution of the inertia contributions; however, when the <b>fault</b> occurs <b>at</b> bus 39, the magnitude of the ROCOF increases with the dispersion of the distribution of the inertia contributions. Also, Fig.  6 shows that, in most of scenarios of inertia constants, the magnitude of the ROCOF caused by the <b>fault</b> <b>at</b> bus 39 is much larger than that caused by the <b>fault</b> <b>at</b> bus 30, 33, 35, or 36. Thus, the average of the magnitudes of the ROCOF caused by the <b>fault</b> <b>at</b> these buses increases with the dispersion of the distribution of the inertia contributions.|$|R
