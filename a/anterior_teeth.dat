5|$|The {{most common}} fossils of megalodon are its teeth. Diagnostic {{characteristics}} include a triangular shape, robust structure, large size, fine serrations, {{a lack of}} lateral denticles, and a visible V-shaped neck (where the root meets the crown). The tooth met the jaw at a steep angle, similar to the great white shark. The tooth was anchored by connective tissue fibers, and the roughness of the base may have added to mechanical strength. The lingual side of the tooth, the part facing the tongue, was convex; and the labial side, {{the other side of}} the tooth, was slightly convex or flat. The <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> were almost perpendicular to the jaw and symmetrical, whereas the posterior teeth were slanted and asymmetrical.|$|E
5|$|The viper dogfish has a slender, {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} moderately flattened head with a very short and blunt snout. Behind the large oval eyes are narrow, elliptical spiracles. The nostrils are nearly vertical slits. The jaws are long and narrowly triangular, and can be protruded from the head. The teeth are distinctively fang-like and widely spaced; the most <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> are grooved lengthwise. Six to 10 upper and seven to 10 lower tooth rows occur on each side, along with a single tooth row at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are largest at the symphysis and decline in size towards the corners of the mouth. When the mouth is closed, the upper symphysial tooth overlaps the lower, while the lateral teeth interlock. Five gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair longer than the others.|$|E

25|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review {{concluded that there}} is insufficient evidence to determine {{the effectiveness of these}} clear aligners. Opinion is that they are likely useful for moderate front-teeth crowding. In those with teeth that are too far forward or backward, or rotated in the socket, the aligners are likely not as effective as conventional braces. More cases of relapse of the <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> have been found with clear aligners compared with conventional braces. A 2013 Cochrane review found no high-quality evidence with respect to the management of the recurrence of lower-front-teeth misalignment following treatment.|$|E
25|$|One {{possible}} issue facing bite mark {{analysis is}} a lack of bite mark uniqueness in any given population. Bite mark analysis is based on the assumptions that the dental characteristics of <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> involved in biting are unique amongst individuals, and this asserted uniqueness is transferred and recorded in the injury. However, there is very little reliable research to support these assumptions. A study performed by MacFarlane et al. supported the notion of dental uniqueness, but the study revolved around the visual assessment of a cast as opposed to the bite mark that could have been produced by the cast. In another study conducted by Sognnaes et al., the group tried to find uniqueness between the dental profiles of identical twins in an attempt to prove dental uniqueness in the general population. However, this study suffered from a small sample size (n=5), with the intent to extrapolate the data to the general population. They also used plaster of paris as the substrate to simulate skin, yet the two materials have very different properties. In a review conducted by Strom, he references a study conducted by Berg and Schaidt which suggested that at least four to five teeth need to be present in the mark to ensure its uniqueness and make a positive identification. However, this study was done long before many of the current evaluation methods, and this sheds doubt on how applicable these conclusions are today.|$|E

500|$|In {{remarking}} on {{the short}} snout and strong jaw, features often seen in primates, [...] Gheerbrant (2010) suggested that Ocepeia was similarly a leaf-eater, although [...] "peculiarly specialized": the <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> probably had great strength for gripping or shearing food, and the molars show a shape and wear pattern suggesting they functioned primarily in shearing, as opposed to grinding or crushing. Gheerbrant further speculated that Ocepeia may have shared a similar arboreal lifestyle with primates.

500|$|The {{nursehound}} attains {{a length}} of , though most measure less than [...] This shark has a broad, rounded head and a stout body that tapers towards the tail. The eyes are oval in shape, with a thick fold of skin on the lower rim but no nictitating membrane. Unlike in the small-spotted catshark, the large flaps of skin beside the nares do not reach the mouth. In the upper jaw, there are 2227 tooth rows on either side and 02 teeth at the symphysis (center); in the lower jaw, there are 1821 tooth rows on either side and 24 teeth at the symphysis. The teeth are Y-shaped and smooth-edged; the <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> have a single central cusp, while the posterior teeth have an additional pair of lateral cusplets. Towards {{the rear of the}} jaws, the teeth become progressively smaller and more angled, with proportionately larger lateral cusplets. The five pairs of gill slits are small, with the last two over the pectoral fin bases.|$|E
500|$|The skull had {{a narrow}} snout filled with {{straight}} conical teeth that lacked serrations. There were {{six or seven}} teeth {{on each side of}} the very front of the upper jaw, in the premaxillae, and another twelve in both maxillae behind them. [...] The second and third teeth on each side were noticeably larger than the rest of the teeth in the premaxilla, creating a space between them and the large teeth in the anterior maxilla; large teeth in the lower jaw faced this space.

500|$|The i3 of Dermotherium {{chimaera}} is an elongate tooth bearing six tines (narrow, high [...] "fingers" [...] as in a comb) arranged {{from front}} to back. The frontmost is larger, the next four are about equal in size, and the sixth is smaller. The number of tines resembles that seen in the Sunda colugo, which has four to seven; the Philippine colugo has three to five. The c1 is also an elongate, narrow tooth; at the front, it is slightly curved towards the midline of the jaw. On the buccal (outer) side of this tooth are six cusps, of which the third (counting from the front) is the largest. The p3 is similarly elongate and rounded at the front, but it is broader at the back, forming a talonid (a [...] "heel" [...] of cusps {{at the back of}} a tribosphenic tooth). There are six cusps on the narrow anterior part of the tooth, and the fifth (identified as the protoconid) is by far the largest. On the buccal side of the talonid is a strong cusp, the hypoconid, with a crest, the cristid obliqua, descending from it towards the front. A second, smaller cusp, the hypoconulid, is present on the lingual side of the talonid, connected to the hypoconid by a postcristid.

2500|$|Physiologically, teeth {{provide for}} greater chewing ability. [...] They {{allow us to}} {{masticate}} food thoroughly, increasing the surface area necessary {{to allow for the}} enzymes present in the saliva, {{as well as in the}} stomach and intestines, to digest our food. [...] Chewing also allows food to be prepared into small boli that are more readily swallowed than haphazard chunks of considerable size. [...] For those who are even partially endentulous, it may become extremely difficult to chew food efficiently enough to swallow comfortably, although this is entirely dependent upon which teeth are lost. [...] When an individual loses enough posterior teeth to make it difficult to chew, he or she may need to cut their food into very small pieces and learn how to make use of their <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> to chew. [...] If enough posterior teeth are missing, this will not only affect their chewing abilities, but also their occlusion; posterior teeth, in a mutually protected occlusion, help to protect the <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> and the vertical dimension of occlusion and, when missing, the <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> begin to bear a greater amount of force for which they are structurally prepared. [...] Thus, loss of posterior teeth will cause the <b>anterior</b> <b>teeth</b> to splay. [...] This can be prevented by obtaining dental prostheses, such as removable partial dentures, bridges or implant-supported crowns. [...] In addition to reestablishing a protected occlusion, these prostheses can greatly improve one's chewing abilities.|$|E
