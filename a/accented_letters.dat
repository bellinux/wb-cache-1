25|$|Finnish. Carons in š and ž appear only {{in foreign}} proper names and loanwords, {{but may be}} {{substituted}} with sh or zh {{if and only if}} it is technically impossible to produce <b>accented</b> <b>letters</b> in the medium.

25|$|Thus, {{although}} {{perhaps a}} majority of Filipinos have Spanish surnames, such a surname does not indicate Spanish ancestry. In addition, most Filipinos currently do not use Spanish <b>accented</b> <b>letters</b> in their Spanish derived names. The lack of accents in Filipino Spanish {{has been attributed to}} the lack of accents on the predominantly American typewriters after the US gained control of the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|Languages that treat <b>accented</b> <b>letters</b> as {{variants}} {{of the underlying}} letter usually alphabetize words with such symbols immediately after similar unmarked words. For instance, in German where two words differ only by an umlaut, the word without it is sorted first in German dictionaries (e.g. schon and then schön, or fallen and then fällen). However, when names are concerned (e.g. in phone books or in author catalogues in libraries), umlauts are often treated as combinations of the vowel with a suffixed e; Austrian phone books now treat characters with umlauts as separate letters (immediately following the underlying vowel).|$|E
25|$|The <b>accented</b> <b>letter</b> ń used in Polish and the {{character}} ň used in Czech and Slovak are also equivalent to the Spanish letter ñ. The same sound is written ny in Indonesian, Zhuang, and Hungarian, and nh in Vietnamese and Portuguese.|$|R
5000|$|In Spanish, é is an <b>accented</b> <b>letter</b> and is {{pronounced}} just like [...] "e" [...] /e/. The accent indicates the stressed syllable in words with irregular stress, as in [...] "éxtasis" [...] or [...] "bebé". See Diacritic and Acute accent for more details.|$|R

25|$|All unaccented {{letters are}} {{pronounced}} approximately {{as in the}} IPA, {{with the exception of}} c. Esperanto j and c are used in a way familiar to speakers of many European languages, but which is largely unfamiliar to English speakers: j has a y sound , as in yellow and boy, and c has a ts sound , as in hits or the zz in pizza. The <b>accented</b> <b>letters</b> are a bit like h-digraphs in English: Ĉ is pronounced like English ch, and ŝ like sh. Ĝ is the g in gem, ĵ a zh sound, as in fusion or French Jacques, and the rare ĥ is like the German , Scottish Gaelic, Scots and Scottish Standard English loch, or how Scouse people sometimes pronounce the 'k' in book and 'ck' in chicken.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a note of}} cantillation in {{the reading}} of the Torah, the Geresh is printed above the accented letter: ב֜. The Geresh Muqdam (lit.

2500|$|On Windows computers, {{letters with}} acute accents {{can be created}} by holding down the alt key and typing in a three-number code on the number pad {{to the right of}} the {{keyboard}} before releasing the Alt key. Before the appearance of Spanish keyboards, Spanish speakers had to learn these codes if they wanted to be able to write acute accents, though some preferred using the Microsoft Word spell checker to add the accent for them. Some young computer users got in the habit of not writing <b>accented</b> <b>letters</b> at all. The codes (which come from the IBM PC encoding) are: ...|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{principal}} workarounds to this problem, which substitute digraphs for the <b>accented</b> <b>letters.</b> Zamenhof, {{the inventor of}} Esperanto, created an [...] "h-convention", which replaces ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, and ŭ with ch, gh, hh, jh, sh, and u, respectively. If used in a database, a program in principle could not determine whether to render, for example, ch as c followed by h or as ĉ, and would fail to render, for example, the word [...] properly. A more recent [...] "x-convention" [...] has gained ground {{since the advent of}} computing. This system replaces each diacritic with an x (not part of the Esperanto alphabet) after the letter, producing the six digraphs cx, gx, hx, jx, sx, and ux.|$|E
2500|$|Fallback and auto-detection: [...] UTF-8 {{provided}} {{backwards compatibility}} for 7-bit ASCII, but much software and data uses 8-bit extended ASCII encodings designed {{prior to the}} adoption of Unicode to represent the character sets of European languages. [...] Part of the popularity of UTF-8 {{is due to the fact}} that it provides a form of backward compatibility for these as well. [...] A UTF-8 processor which erroneously receives an extended ASCII file as input can [...] "fall back" [...] or replace 8-bit bytes using the appropriate code-point in the Unicode Latin-1 Supplement block, when the 8-bit byte appears outside a valid multi-byte sequence. Though it does happen, the 8-bit characters in extended ASCII encodings do not usually have the correct form for UTF-8 multi-byte sequences. This is because the 8-bit bytes which introduce multi-byte sequences in UTF-8 are primarily <b>accented</b> <b>letters</b> (mostly vowels) in the common extended ASCII encodings, and the UTF-8 continuation bytes are punctuation and symbol characters. [...] To appear as a valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequence, a series of 2 to 4 extended ASCII 8-bit characters would have to be an unusual combination of symbols and <b>accented</b> <b>letters.</b> In short, extended ASCII character sequences which look like valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequences are unlikely. Fallback errors will be false negatives, and these will be rare. Moreover, in many applications, such as text display, the consequence of incorrect fallback is usually slight. Only legibility is affected, and not significantly. [...] These two things make fallback feasible, if somewhat imperfect. Indeed, as discussed further below, the HTML5 standard requires that erroneous bytes in supposed UTF-8 data be replaced upon display on the assumption that they are Windows-1252 characters. [...] The presence of invalid 8-bit characters outside valid multi-byte sequences can also be used to [...] "auto-detect" [...] that an encoding is actually an extended ASCII encoding rather than UTF-8, and decode it accordingly. A UTF-8 stream may simply contain errors, resulting in the auto-detection scheme producing false positives; but auto-detection is successful in the majority of cases, especially with longer texts, and is widely used.|$|E

2500|$|In 1894 under {{pressure}} from Wilhelm Trompeter, {{the publisher of the}} magazine La Esperantisto, and some other leading users, Zamenhof reluctantly put forward a radical reform to be voted on by readers. He proposed the reduction of the alphabet to 22 letters (by eliminating the <b>accented</b> <b>letters</b> and most of their sounds), the change of the plural to -i, the use of a positional accusative instead of the ending -n, the removal of the distinction between adjectives and adverbs, the reduction of the number of participles from six to two, and the replacement of the table of correlatives with more Latinate words or phrases. These reforms were overwhelmingly rejected, but some were picked up in subsequent reforms (such as Ido) and criticisms of the language. [...] In the following decade Esperanto spread into western Europe, especially France. By 1905 there were already 27 magazines being published (Auld 1988).|$|E
