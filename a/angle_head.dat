5000|$|In 1988, 2 {{years prior}} to accident, the cable car went under major {{reconstruction}} under {{the lead of the}} head engineer, Vakhtang Lejava. Originally the cable car used 3 supporting towers. Redesigning this meant replacing the 20 meter high lower mast with a new 25 meters high mast. Two short upper masts (10 and 12 meters high) were also replaced by one 20 meter high mast. Prior to this change, gondolas had a slight climbing angle on the two upper masts. Using a single higher mast caused the new gondolas to run from the upper station horizontal to the mast and then, with a sharp <b>angle,</b> <b>head</b> down. The standard oval Georgian gondolas (with a capacity of 25 per gondola) which were produced in Tbilisi in Tbilisi Aircraft Manufacturing, were replaced by Italian larger rectangular ones built by [...] "Lovisolo" [...] and provided by [...] "Ceretti & Tanfani", providing greater passenger capacity (40 per gondola). The braking system of the new gondolas did not function properly - while climbing over the upper mast, the braking system would incorrectly engage. The service staff would have to climb on top of the gondola and turn it off manually when this occurred. To avoid this inconvenience, the brakes were just turned off. Additionally, {{on the day of the}} accident, both gondolas were over-capacity: the lower gondola had 46 passengers on board, the upper gondola held 47 passengers.|$|E

40|$|In general, recent {{critical}} {{studies of}} five-axis machine {{have tended to}} center {{on the question of}} effective machining to realize complex shape parts.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general mathematical treatment of serial manipulators, an important example {{of which is}} the servo head. The paper includes validation by application to the <b>angle</b> <b>head</b> via comparison with the previously known transformations and a new application to the error analysis of the <b>angle</b> <b>head.</b> The usual approach to the error analysis of a servo head is to develop a geometrical model by elementary geometrical considerations using trigonometric relationships and various simplifying assumptions. This approach is very error prone, difŽ cult to verify and extremely time consuming. The techniques described here constitute matrix methods that have been programmed in a general way to derive automatically the analytical equations relating the angles of rotation of the head and alignment errors in the head to the position of the tool and errors in that position. The approach is to use rotation and transformation matrices to evaluate the in� uence of the various errors such as offsets and angular errors. A general approach to the sign convention and notation for angular errors is presented in an attempt to reduce the possibility of errors of deŽ nition...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The spatiotemporal {{information}} in chemical signals provides critical information for organisms during chemical orientation. Information in chemical signals {{is influenced by}} the hydrodynamic conditions of the environment. Hydro-dynamically distinct environments will contain different types of information, which will influence how organisms orient. This study was designed to examine how the orientation behavior of the brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) is influenced by flow regime. The experiment was conducted in a flume under two different flow conditions. Treatments consisted of control (no odor) and plain gelatin (odor). Percent success, swimming speed, turning <b>angle,</b> <b>heading</b> <b>angle,</b> <b>heading</b> <b>angle</b> upstream, and net-to-gross ratio were analyzed. Brown bullheads were 100 % successful in finding the odor source under no flow and 57 % success-ful in flow. Bullheads swam differently in the no-flow condition when compared to the flow condition. Since, these fish did not orient the same under different flow conditions, it appears that hydrodynamics plays a role in shaping their behavior.
