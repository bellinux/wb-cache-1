Geometrical optics was used initially to determine the ideal feed pattern required to produce uniform illumination on the aperture of the conical reflector and the reverse problem of quickly finding the <b>aperture</b> <b>illumination</b> given an arbitrary feed pattern. The knowledge of the <b>aperture</b> <b>illumination</b> makes it possible to compute the antenna efficiency, which is useful for comparing antenna performance during tradeoff studies.

40|$|A spiral array {{radial line}} slot antenna (SA-RLSA) is {{designed}} in 22 GHz band. A SA-RLSA excited with a coaxial feeder suffers from <b>aperture</b> <b>illumination</b> fluctuation in amplitude and {{phase in the}} circumferential (φ-) direction while in the radial direction, reasonably uniform distribution is observed. Rotational symmetry of radiation patterns is degraded and especially the sidelobe levels are unbalanced. This fluctuation {{is associated with the}} generation of the higher order modes in the φ-direction and is the unique defect of SA-RLSA which uses oversized waveguide. In this paper, a novel feeding structure with two pairs of parasitic pins around a coaxial feeder is proposed and designed so as to compensate the rotational asymmetry of <b>aperture</b> <b>illumination.</b> A measurement using the model antenna designed in 22 GHz band demonstrates the enhancement of the rotational symmetry; the circumferential fluctuation is reduced from 5. 1 dB and 33 degrees to 1. 8 dB and 12 degrees, while the fluctuation in the first sidelobe level suppressed from 10. 7 dB to 1. 2 dB...|$|E

40|$|For {{quantitative}} phase imaging (QPI) {{based on}} transport-of-intensity equation (TIE), partially coherent illumination provides speckle-free imaging, compatibility with brightfield microscopy, and transverse resolution beyond coherent diffraction limit. Unfortunately, {{in a conventional}} microscope with circular <b>illumination</b> <b>aperture,</b> partial coherence tends to diminish the phase contrast, exacerbating the inherent noise-to-resolution tradeoff in TIE imaging, resulting in strong low-frequency artifacts and compromised imaging resolution. Here, we demonstrate how these issues can be effectively addressed by replacing the conventional circular <b>illumination</b> <b>aperture</b> with an annular one. The matched annular illumination not only strongly boosts the phase contrast for low spatial frequencies, but significantly improves the practical imaging resolution to near the incoherent diffraction limit. By incorporating high-numerical <b>aperture</b> (NA) <b>illumination</b> as well as high-NA objective, it is shown, for the first time, that TIE phase imaging can achieve a transverse resolution up to 208 nm, corresponding to an effective NA of 2. 66. Time-lapse imaging of in vitro Hela cells revealing cellular morphology and subcellular dynamics during cells mitosis and apoptosis is exemplified. Given its capability for high-resolution QPI {{as well as the}} compatibility with widely available brightfield microscopy hardware, the proposed approach is expected to be adopted by the wider biology and medicine community.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} antenna placement options on crowded platforms, three methods for synthesizing conformal phased array excitations on curved surfaces were computer programmed and compared: the Alternating Projections method (AP), the Successive Projections method (SP), and the Genetic Algorithm method (GA). The comparison was based on how closely the synthesized patterns conformed to the desired pattern amplitudes, and on the resulting taper efficiency. An expression for taper efficiency of a curved array was derived, showing directivity compared to a linear array. Greater efficiency would increase gain for a given antenna size. Taper efficiency is useful in evaluating the synthesis methods since different methods can produce very different <b>aperture</b> <b>illuminations</b> despite similarity in the resulting patterns. Curved arrays were computer modeled ranging from 17 to 97 elements. Different initial excitations, element patterns, and desired pattern masks were investigated. The AP method synthesized patterns closest to the desired patterns, closely followed by the GA method. The SP method tended to get stuck in local minima for difficult cases. The GA method was programmed to optimize taper efficiency, but it takes much longer to run {{than the other two}} methods...|$|R

The approximate model reflecting the reflection-canceling feature of slot pairs dispenses with the full analysis of practical structure with thousands of slots. 1. <b>Aperture</b> <b>illumination</b> of slotted oversized waveguide arrays Rectangular parallel plate slotted arrays using dielectric substrate, named a post-wall waveguide array shown in Fig. 1 are attractive candidates for high efficiency and mass producible planar array antennas in millimeter wave applications[1 - 5].

40|$|One of {{the long-standing}} {{problems}} in antenna engineering is {{the realization of}} highly-directive beams using low-profile devices. In this paper we provide {{a solution to this}} problem by means of Huygens' metasurfaces (HMSs), based on the equivalence principle. This principle states that a given excitation can be transformed to a desirable aperture field by inducing suitable electric and magnetic surface currents. Building on this concept, we propose and demonstrate cavity-excited HMS antennas, where the single-source cavity excitation is designed to optimize <b>aperture</b> <b>illumination,</b> while the HMS facilitates the current distribution that ensures phase purity of aperture fields. The HMS breaks the coupling between the excitation and radiation spectrum typical to standard partially-reflecting surfaces, allowing tailoring of the aperture properties to produce a desirable radiation pattern. As shown, a single semianalytical formalism can be followed to achieve control of a variety of radiation features, such as the direction of the main beam or the side lobe level, by proper modification of the HMS and the source position. Relying on a cavity excitation, this can be achieved without incurring edge-taper losses and without any degradation of the <b>aperture</b> <b>illumination</b> for arbitrarily-large apertures. With the recent demonstrations of Huygens' metasurfaces at microwave, terahertz, and optical frequencies, the proposed low-profile design may find its use in a myriad of applications across the electromagnetic spectrum, from highly-directive antennas to highly-efficient quantum-dot emitters, reaching near-unity aperture efficiencies.

40|$|The {{amount of}} infomation about {{the angle of}} arrival of a plane wave {{incident}} on a line aperture is shown {{to depend on the}} bandwidth of the incident signal {{as well as on the}} extent of the aperture. Conventional antenna theory assumes the angular resolution of an antenna depends only on the aperture extent and illumination. However, by autocorrelation techniques further angular resolution can be obtained. This additional directivity depends on the extent of the signal bandwidth. It is shown for line arrays that the obtainable directivity information depends on the aperture ilhmination function and the autocormlation function of the incident signal. In view of the vast amount of information available concerning conventional antennas, the results of this paper have been related to conventional antenna theory. The antenna designer can specify the desired directivity pattern in terms of a conventional single-frequency <b>aperture</b> <b>illumination</b> function. The effects of this single frequency illumination function can then be achieved for wide-band signals by a simpler illumination function. Some examples of the theory are given. antenna to the other.
