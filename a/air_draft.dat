40|$|There {{are five}} basic causes of animal welfare {{problems}} in slaughter plants: 1. Poorly designed or improper stunning and handling equipment. 2. Distractions which impede animal movement, such as sparkling reflections on a wet floor, air hissing, high-pitched noise or <b>air</b> <b>drafts</b> blowing down the race towards approaching animals. These distractions can ruin {{the performance of}} a well designed system and cause animals to become excited. When this happens, prodding will be required to make them move. 3. Lack of employee training and poor supervision of employees by management. 4. Poor maintenance of equipment and facilities, such as malfunctioning stunners or worn, slick, floors which cause animals to slip and fall. 5. Poor condition of animals arriving at the plant, such as cripples and sick animals. Another problem is pigs and cattle from excitable genetic lines which are more likely to become agitated during handling To maintain a high standard of welfare, all five problem areas must be addressed. A survey of 29 Canadian slaughter plants indicated that 27 % had excellent non-slip floors and 21 % had slick floors which would cause animals to slip. Twenty-four percent had high pitched motor noise or hissing air exhausts that caused animals to balk. <b>Air</b> <b>drafts</b> blowing down the race toward approaching animals were a problem in 9 % of the plants. <b>Air</b> <b>drafts</b> will often impede animal movement...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to sudden changes in water levels, {{there are a}} number of very low bridges with an <b>air</b> <b>draft</b> of less than , which can cause problems if the water levels rise a little, and there are often no turning places at the end of the drains. Cruising can be hazardous due to weed growth, which forms a dense blanket in some channels, but a drain that was formerly virtually un-navigable may suddenly be cleared to improve its drainage performance and become navigable again. One unexpected possibility of cruising the drains is to visit New York, a hamlet just to the north of Hough Bridge on the West Fen Drain.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} mass-producing cheap steel was solved in 1855 by Henry Bessemer, with the {{introduction}} of the Bessemer converter at his steelworks in Sheffield, England. (An early converter can still be seen at the city's Kelham Island Museum). In the Bessemer process, molten pig iron from the blast furnace was charged into a large crucible, and then air was blown through the molten iron from below, igniting the dissolved carbon from the coke. As the carbon burned off, the melting point of the mixture increased, but the heat from the burning carbon provided the extra energy needed to keep the mixture molten. After the carbon content in the melt had dropped to the desired level, the <b>air</b> <b>draft</b> was cut off: a typical Bessemer converter could convert a 25-ton batch of pig iron to steel in half an hour.|$|E

2500|$|Pure {{ethylene}} glycol has a {{specific heat capacity}} about one half that of water. [...] So, while providing freeze protection and an increased boiling point, {{ethylene glycol}} lowers the specific heat capacity of water mixtures relative to pure water. [...] A 1:1 mix by mass has a specific heat capacity of about 3140 J/(kg·°C) (0.75 BTU/(lb·°F)), three quarters that of pure water, thus requiring increased flow rates in same system comparisons with water. The formation of large bubbles in cooling passages of internal combustion engines will seriously inhibit heat flow (flux) from that area, thus allowing nucleation (tiny bubbles) heat transfer to occur is not advisable. Large bubbles in cooling passages will be self-sustaining or grow larger, with virtually {{the complete loss of}} cooling in that spot. With pure MEG that hot spot has to get to 200 °C. Cooling due to other effects such as <b>air</b> <b>draft</b> from fan etc. (not considered in pure nucleation analysis) will assist in preventing large-bubble formation.|$|E

40|$|Monitoring {{animal welfare}} at a {{slaughterhouse}} is somehow {{different from the}} situation on the farm. The throughput numbers can be very high, and there is no possibility to know the individual history, background or habits of each animal. The animals are unfamiliar to the staff and viceversa. Furthermore, most animals will be unknown to each other even if they may be delivered in groups or batches, and it is not rare to see mixing of completely unfamiliar animals. The slaughter plants’ environment is of course completely unknown to the animals, with large areas not always designed to minimize noise or visual distraction for animals. Sub-optimal handling of animals can unfortunately be seen at many slaughterhouses, where animals are coerced roughly, using sticks or prods and loud voices, forcing the animals to move fast in the desired direction. Vets {{need to be aware of}} these factors because they can cause excessive prodding for animals, which may become balking, excited and stressed. A survey of 10 italian slaughter plants revealed that: 5 plants had slick floors that would cause animals to slip and fall, 9 plants had high pitched motor noise or hissing air that made animals balking; <b>air</b> <b>drafts</b> blowing down the chutes, which will often impede animal movement, were a problem in 9 of the observed plants. Simple modifications of lighting and elimination of <b>air</b> <b>drafts</b> and hissing will often greatly improve animal movement...|$|R

50|$|The 1100 series {{locomotives}} were unpopular with NS drivers. The locomotives used {{an unusual}} design: the buffers {{are attached to}} the wheel assembly instead of the main body. Buffers attached to the main body are a common design feature, which provides a steady ride as the body is stabilized because it is pressed against the car it is pulling. The 1100 series lacked this stability, resulting in a very nervous bouncy ride which can be compared to a ride on a wooden roller coaster. The cabin was designed for French drivers in 1950, and anyone taller than 1.70 m had a hard time in the nonadjustable driver seat, and <b>air</b> <b>drafted</b> around drivers' lower legs. In operation, cooling fans in the engine compartment produced a remarkably loud roar. For these reasons the locomotives were downright hated, and until 1980, their drivers were paid a special bonus, one originally designated for dirty or unpleasant work.|$|R
