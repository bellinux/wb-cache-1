40|$|A {{product line}} of {{improved}} electrohydraulic linear actuators has been developed. These actuators are designed especially {{for use in}} actuating valves in rocket-engine test facilities. They are also adaptable to many industrial uses, such as steam turbines, process control valves, dampers, motion control, etc. The advantageous features of the improved electrohydraulic linear actuators are best described with respect to shortcomings of prior electrohydraulic linear actuators that the improved ones are intended to supplant. The flow of hydraulic fluid to the two ports of the actuator cylinder is controlled by a servo valve that is controlled by a signal from a servo amplifier that, in turn, receives an analog position-command signal (a current having a value between 4 and 20 mA) from a supervisory control system of the facility. As the position command changes, the servo valve shifts, causing a greater flow of hydraulic fluid {{to one side of}} the cylinder and thereby causing the <b>actuator</b> <b>piston</b> to move to extend or retract a piston rod from the actuator body. A linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) directly linked to the piston provides a position-feedback signal, which is compared with the position-command signal in the servo amplifier. When the position-feedback and position-command signals match, the servo valve moves to its null position, in which it holds the <b>actuator</b> <b>piston</b> at a steady position...|$|E

In the valve actuation system proposed, a Caterpillar solenoid valve of the HEUI fuel system and a commercial hydraulic actuator were used as the distributor and final control element, respectively. The examination was carried out on a specially prepared model of the valve actuation system under consideration. The influence of various construction parameters of the system on {{the course of the}} valve displacement process was examined, with analysing such characteristic parameters of the process as delay in the start of the valve motion measured {{from the beginning of the}} current control signal, valve opening and closing times, time of the valve kept open, valve displacement vs. time curve, filling ratio of the area under the valve lift curve, and velocity of the valve hitting its seat. The construction parameters whose impacts were analysed included oil supply pressure, total working space volume, power supply voltage, distributor solenoid force, cross-sections of the distributor supply and overflow gaps, total mass of moving distributor parts, engine valve mass, <b>actuator</b> <b>piston</b> diameter, and valve spring characteristic curve. The necessity of using high supply pressures and high control voltages has been proven. Guidelines for designing engine valve actuation systems of this type have been given.

40|$|This thesis treats {{position}} control of an electropneumatic clutch actuator operated by simple on/off solenoid valves. This clutch actuator {{is intended for}} automatic manual transmission systems or clutch-by-wire systems in heavy duty trucks. Pressurized air is already present {{as a part of}} the brake system in such vehicles, and pneumatics is therefore the natural choice for actuating the manual transmission in these clutch actuator systems. Production cost is a crucial factor in all parts of the automobile industry. For the clutch actuator system this influence the choice of number of sensors present in the production system, limiting it to only a position sensor. It also lead to that a set of on/off solenoid valve is chosen for actuation over more commonly used proportional valves, even though it complicates the control task. Production quality sensors are considered in this thesis, and these are sensors which are more influenced by noise than sensors found in test rigs made for research and development. Motor vibration and possible other mechanical influence also have to be taken into consideration when testing in a full-scale truck as done in this thesis. Motivated by the choice of on/off solenoid valves as the control valves in the clutch actuator system, switched control design is considered. Switched controllers exploit the on/off solenoid valves discrete behavior, switching the valves between fully open and fully closed in a manner such that desired supply or exhaust of air from the actuator chamber is obtained, ensuring the demanded piston position. Based on this line of action, two switched controllers are developed along with a dual-mode switched controller utilizing the best features of the individual controllers. Stability analysis based on standard Lyapunov theory are provided, and the performance of the controllers are tested in a full-scale test truck at Kongsberg Automotive ASA. Both theoretical and practical performance analyses confirm that switch controllers are well suited for <b>actuator</b> <b>piston</b> {{position control}} of the clutch actuator system. Full-state feedback availability is assumed in the design of the switched controllers. Adaptive nonlinear observers are derived to provide estimates of unmeasured states and parameters for the clutch actuator system. These adaptive observers are deterministic with linear output-injection, and have adaptation laws for estimation of clutch load characteristics and friction. A full-order adaptive observer, including filtering of position for suppression of noise, shows best performance. The adaptation of unknown parameters accounts for wear of the clutch and variations in temperature, ensuring a robust design of the clutch actuator model and improving state estimates. Theoretical analyses of convergence are derived under persistence of excitation condition, and performance of the adaptive observers are validated by experimental data. The switched controller and the adaptive nonlinear are combined into an observerbased switched controller. Simulation of this is provided, comparing the results with actual truck measurements. These analysis indicate that the pressure sensor can be exchanged with an adaptive nonlinear observer without significant loss of performance for nonlinear state feedback based control designs for the system.

40|$|Compressibility of air used as {{a working}} medium in {{pneumatic}} control systems raise certain difficulties in calculating dynamic characteristics of the pneumatic drive and solving problems of its regulation. These difficulties are due {{to a number of}} factors:    - flow of compressed air through the narrow working splits of distributive and throttling devices of pneumatic control;    - filling in and discharging the pneumatic actuator cavities of variable volume (piston and rod cavities of the air-cylinder) under conditions of heat and mass transfer;    - simultaneous filling in and discharging a pneumatic cavity of permanent volume (receiver);    - pneumatic cylinder piston end positioning alteration under variable loading and at the moment of shutdown; A number of factors {{have a significant impact on}} the piston end positioning alteration value, namely an initial positioning of the piston at the moment of its shutdown, which determines the volume of the pneumatic cylinder cavity; a value of the permanent component of the load at the moment the piston shuts down and its change during keeping time period; transmission coefficient of the positioning component of the load; a working area of the air-cylinder piston and also an atmospheric pressure reduction, which can significantly affect the operation of control systems of a small aircraft at high altitudes. With a view to deepening the problem of calculation and design of pneumatic actuators, it is shown that the relationship between the parameters of compressed air and their changes is determined by the properties of thermodynamic processes under conditions of heat and mass transfer. In pneumatic actuators for general industrial use, the pressure of compressed air does not exceed a value equal to 1 MPa. In this case, the working medium can be regarded as an ideal gas in simplified calculations. Based on the general equation of thermodynamics, the paper considers the particular cases of a changing gas state process under its constant temperature, pressure, and volume and also in the absolute or partial absence of heat exchange with the surrounding medium. The inconstancy of the compressed air mass during filling in and discharging of pneumatic cavities of variable volume causes non-stationary thermodynamic processes in the pneumatic actuators and requires their specifying in conditions of heat and mass exchange. The pneumatic <b>actuator</b> <b>piston</b> speed is related to the peculiarities of the working medium movement through the narrow slits of distribution and control devices of pneumatic automation due to dependency of the flow on the outflow parameter, which in turn is related to the criticality of the outflow process (the ratio of the pressure at the outlet of the throttling device and at its inlet). It is shown that when calculating and designing the pneumatic drives, including closed-loop ones, as well as for evaluating their dynamic characteristics, a system solution of the equations determining the processes of filling and discharging the cavities of the pneumatic cylinder is required, taking into account the peculiarities of compressed air movement through the narrow slits of pneumatic automation devices. The outflow parameter available in the equations of the pneumatic drive dynamics and determined by the outflow process criticality and by the heat exchange conditions (a poly-tropic index) requires their numerical solution. </p...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} nastic materials applied to twisting a rigid beam. Nastic materials contain small, simple machines in a compliant matrix. Here a generic beam must twist by ? 4 degrees; the ? 4 degrees twist is an optimum value {{to change the}} angle of attack on a helicopter?s rotor blade. Small <b>piston</b> <b>actuators</b> distributed through the beam?s outer core provide the internal work needed. By actuating the piston elements in their axial direction, which is transverse to the beam?s central axis, the beam twists as desired. This study?s objective is to gain insight into the geometry, the material property combinations, and the boundary conditions that produce nastic materials and structures that twist. An important performance metric is the work density, which {{is the product of}} blocked stress and free strain. Blocked stress is the maximum actuation stress in a single stroke that produces maximum work output and free strain is the maximum actuation strain that produces the maximum work output. Optimum work density was found for the <b>piston</b> <b>actuators.</b> As it is difficult to model distributed <b>piston</b> <b>actuators</b> across the beam?s outer core, <b>piston</b> <b>actuator?s</b> effective properties are calculated using finite element models and homogenized in the beam?s outer core.
