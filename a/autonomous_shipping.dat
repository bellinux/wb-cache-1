40|$|Automation is {{a concept}} that is rapidly {{evolving}} in many fields. The development of autonomous cars and trucks are already being seen publicly. <b>Autonomous</b> <b>ships</b> is bound to follow but the complexity of ships creates a big challenge. The main reasons autonomous systems are under continuous development is to improve safety and reduce cost. There is a general demand that <b>autonomous</b> <b>ships</b> must be at least as safe as conventional <b>ships.</b> To make <b>autonomous</b> <b>ships</b> safe, human errors needs to be reduced as much as possible, while still having a human in the loop.

40|$|Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are {{increasingly}} {{used as the}} main source of Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) information for inland water navigation. Therefore, it becomes of crucial importance to ensure reliability and accuracy of the GNSS-based navigation solution for challenging inland waterway environments like locks or bridges where effects such as multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) can occur. This work extends the single-antenna snapshot positioning solver to a multi-antenna snapshot positioning and orientation solver. In contrast to a single position calculation for each individual antenna, this combined approach allows position and orientation calculation even in the case that each antenna has less than four observations. Any additional observation {{can be used in a}} robust estimation framework, for instance by applying the S-estimator, to lessen the impact of NLOS effects. Moreover, different weighting options for the satellite signals are considered where the elevation angle of the satellites, as well as the signal-to-noise ratio measured by the receiver, is taken into account. The presented scheme is evaluated using real measurement data from an inland water scenario with multiple bridges and a waterway lock. With regard to single-antenna algorithms the initial results are encouraging and clearly indicate the advantage of the combined position and orientation calculation with multiple GNSS antennas, especially in scenarios where direct GNSS signals are obstructed. Also the multi-antenna scheme in combination with a robust estimation framework shows the potential to be used in advanced driver assistance systems for integrated navigation as well as <b>autonomous</b> <b>shipping.</b> Why of interest? Well-known robust methods such as the S-estimator can easily be applied to this scheme and in such further help with NLOS as well as multipath effects. This allows for reliable driver assistance systems which are of utmost importance since the majority of inland water accidents are caused by human faults. Therefore, the need for robust navigation schemes such as this is as high as it has ever been...|$|E
40|$|Autonomous sailing is {{considered}} by many to be the next big thing in the shipping sector. Many companies, including Rolls Royce and DNV are investing heavily in research that helps in the development of <b>autonomous</b> <b>shipping.</b> Most research is currently being done regarding autonomous navigation, communication and cyber security. What is often neglected in these studies is the need for maintenance within the engine room. With all ships having multiple crew members solely dedicated to keep the engine room going, their absence will have a big impact on the design of engine rooms. This paper aims to find what equipment will become a weak point in engine rooms once these are no longer occupied and maintained by crew members, and how these weak points can be eliminated. With the absence of reliability data that corrects for maintenance and crew interference, this paper tries to find these weak points by analysing crew member behaviour. It is assumed that if a crew members spends more time on equipment, or deals with it more frequently, then that piece of equipment is less reliable. In order to find what equipment can be seen as a weak point, a redundancy reduced risk index was created. This index is a combination of the frequency index, which states how often engineers spend time on equipment, the severity index, which lists the consequences of failure for equipment, and the redundancy index, which is dependent on the level of redundancy of components. The redundancy reduced risk index is split into three levels: low, medium, and high risk. Medium and high-risk components were considered weak points, while low risk components were not. For all high risk and for most medium risk components, solutions were generated which will reduce the risk index of the components or system overall. For some components, the risk was deemed acceptable, as any solutions would be too costly to justify the risk reduction. Solutions were split into two categories: specific solutions, which were all catered to specific components, and a bulk solution, which was the installation of a second drive train. A second drive train would include a second main engine, gearbox, propeller and rudder. With the solutions found, the two categories were subjected to a financial analysis to see if they are commercially viable. The solutions were applied to ships of four different sizes, ranging from a 6, 000 GT feeder to an 85, 000 GT capesize bulk carrier. For these ships, the OPEX were calculated and divided into four categories: Operational costs, fuel costs, capital costs and crew costs. The initial investment for the machinery plant was also calculated. This was the basis to finding the increased cost for solutions found in this paper. Using these specific solutions, the machinery plants will become roughly 50 % more expensive, while adding a second drive train will increase the machinery cost by 110 %. It is assumed that these solutions will eliminate the need for a crew and therefore eliminate all crew costs. Using these figures, it was found that the specific solutions will lead to a potential yearly savings of $ 600, 000. – for all ship sizes, and adding a second drive train will lead to a potential yearly savings of $ 500, 000 – for the small ship and $ 163, 000. – for the larger ships. With both the specific solutions and the second drive train, the machinery plant is deemed reliable enough for continuously unmanned operation, which proves the technical feasibility of continuously unmanned engine rooms.

40|$|Maritime {{transport}} is {{an essential}} part of today´s logistics chains. Nevertheless, due to technical and environmental constraints as well as historical reasons, vessels are only partly connected to logistics networks. The demand for <b>autonomous</b> <b>ships</b> is basically motivated to increase substainability, competitiveness and growth of maritime transport itself, as stated by Europe´s Waterborne Technology Platform. Notwithstanding, it could furthermore enable a better integration of vessels into coordinated international logistics networks as a by-product.

40|$|The recent {{trend to}} design more {{efficient}} and versatile ships has increased the variety in hybrid propulsion and power supply architectures. In order to improve performance with these architectures, intelligent control strategies are required, while mostly conventional control strategies are applied currently. First, this paper classifies ship propulsion topologies into mechanical, electrical and hybrid propulsion, and power supply topologies into combustion, electrochemical, stored and hybrid power supply. Then, we review developments in propulsion and power supply systems and their control strategies, to subsequently discuss opportunities and challenges for these systems and the associated control. We conclude that hybrid architectures with advanced control strategies can reduce fuel consumption and emissions up to 10 – 35 %, while improving noise, maintainability, manoeuvrability and comfort. Subsequently, the paper summarises the benefits and drawbacks, and trends in application of propulsion and power supply technologies, and it reviews the applicability and benefits of promising advanced control strategies.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{research}} on seakeeping control of fast ships requires difficult experiments for modeling and control design. To alleviate the ship motion certain active appendages are added, such moving flaps, T-foil and fins. The motion of appendages must be optimized to counteract each encountered wave.

The scaled ship is towed at fixed speeds of experimental interest, for instance at the equivalent to 40 knots. The wavemaker in the towing tank is used to generate specified waves.

Although scaled ships are basis for experimental studies, {{it is not possible}} to keep using them in towing tanks. The main reason is that high speeds require large space for experiments, so towing tanks are not large enough. This has been noticed after the first part of our research, with head seas, in a 150 m x 30 m towing tank with wavemaker. Consequently, we are preparing for open air experiments.
