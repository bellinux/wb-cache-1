This report presents results of an experimental investigation of high-temperature alkali removal from a hot filtered gasifier product gas stream using a packed bed of sorbent material.

40|$|Fourier {{transform}} infrared microscopy {{has been}} used to investigate in situ dehydroxylation of goethite to form hematite. The characterisation was based on the behaviour of hydroxyl units, which were observed in the hydroxyl stretching and hydroxyl deformation and water bending regions, and the Fe–O vibrations of the newly formed hematite during the thermal dehydroxylation process. Two hydroxyl stretching modes (ν 1 and ν 2), and three bending (νbending- 1, 2, 3) and two deformation (νdeformation- 1, 2) modes were observed for goethite. The characteristic vibration at 916 cm− 1 was observed together with the residuals of the ν 1 and ν 2 bands in hematite spectrum. The structural transformation between goethite and hematite through thermal dehydroxylation was interpreted in order to provide criteria {{that can be used for}} the characterisation of thermally <b>activated</b> <b>bauxite</b> and their conversion to activated alumina phases...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the potential of alkali-feldspar ore [(K, Na) AlSi 3 O 8] as an alternative bed material for indirect gasification of biomass. Experiments conducted in the Chalmers 2 -MW gasifier confirmed that alkali-feldspar could withstand stringent fluidizing conditions. Moreover, this material showed strong promise for promoting the water gas shift reaction and reforming higher hydrocarbons, in particular tars. This activity was enhanced by time-on-stream in the indirect gasifier, and the gas and tar yields were higher than for <b>activated</b> olivine or <b>bauxite</b> used in the same unit. SEM-EDX analysis revealed that the Observed activity of alkali-feldspar was due to the formation of active ash layers on the feldspar particles (consisting principally of Ca, Mg, K, and Na) that originated from the woody fuel. At some point, the feldspar showed capacity to transport oxygen from the boiler to the gasifier. Thus, an optimal level of bed regeneration would benefit the reforming reactions in the gasifier, while creating the possibility to improve fuel conversion in the boiler through increased access and distribution of oxygen, which is transported by the bed material throughout the boiler...|$|R
40|$|Arsenic is a {{commonly}} occurring toxic metal in natural systems {{and is the}} root cause of many diseases and disorders. Occurrence of arsenic contaminated water is reported from several countries all over the world. A great deal of research over recent decades has been motivated by the requirement to lower the concentration of arsenic in drinking water and the need to develop low cost techniques which can be widely applied for arsenic removal from contaminated water. This review briefly presents iron and aluminium based adsorbents for arsenic removal. Studies carried out on oxidation of arsenic(III) to arsenic(V) employing various oxidising agents to facilitate arsenic removal are briefly mentioned. Effects of competing ions, As:Fe ratios, arsenic(V) vs. arsenic(III) removal using ferrihydrite as the adsorbent have been discussed. Recent efforts made for investigating arsenic adsorption on iron hydroxides/oxyhydroxides/oxides such as granular ferric hydroxide, goethite, akaganeite, magnetite and haematite have been reviewed. The adsorption behaviours of activated alumina, gibbsite, bauxite, <b>activated</b> <b>bauxite,</b> layered double hydroxides are discussed.

The study focuses on an evaluation of the performance of <b>activated</b> <b>bauxite</b> mines in Yazd province in order to remove fluoride from drinking water. Materials and Methods: This study was an experimental one and conducted on synthetic samples and water from May to November of 2013 in Kuhbanan region at the Environmental Health Engineering Research Center. Bauxite was taken from Sadr Abad and Shomal-e-Yazd mines. Bauxite analysis was performed using X- Rey Fraction and X-Ray Diffraction. The effects of pH, contact time, adsorbent dose and different concentrations of fluoride on defluoridation were determined. The optimal conditions were performed on real samples. In order to better understand the processes of absorption, synthetic and adsorption isotherms were studied. Fluoride content was determined by the SPADNS method and data analysis was performed by Excel. Results: The maximum removal efficiency for synthetic solution was obtained by 25 g/L bauxite of Sadr Abad mine and 30 g/L bauxite of Shomal-e-Yazd mine at pH 7, the contact time of 180 minutes as 75. 31 % and 59. 90 %, respectively and removal efficiency of actual samples in optimum conditions was 51. 21 % and 36. 68 %.

40|$|Modern second-generation {{pressurized}} fluidized-bed combustion (2 nd-Gen. PFBC) {{combined cycle}} power systems are developed {{to increase the}} efficiency of coal combustion. However, combined cycle power systems require reliable hot gas cleaning. The alkali metals sodium and potassium can lead to severe damage of the gas turbine blades, because of hot corrosion. This investigation was conducted to assess the potential for the reduction of alkali metals from hot gas by different aluminosilicate sorbents, such as silica, bauxite, bentonite, and mullite, under reducing atmospheres at a temperature of 750 degreesC. Using a flow channel reactor, an alkali chloride-laden gas stream was passed through a bed of aluminosilicate sorbents. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the hot gas downstream of the sorbent bed was performed using high-pressure mass spectrometry (HPMS). Thus, the influence of different gas atmospheres on the alkali sorption was determined and conclusions were drawn concerning the chemical reactions that were occurring inside the sorbent bed. Moreover, annealing experiments were performed to determine the sorption capacity of the sorbent. Subsequent scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses showed that the phases formed inside the tested sorbent materials. Sorbent capacities for sodium and potassium of up to 110 mg/g have been achieved after 192 h for bentonite. Finally, thermodynamic computations were performed to scale the results of the laboratory experiments up to the conditions prevalent in 2 nd-Gen. PFBC systems. The investigations revealed the possibility of reducing the overall alkali concentration in the hot gas under 2 nd-Gen. PFBC conditions to values of < 50 ppbv through the use of bentonite and <b>activated</b> <b>bauxite.</b> The amount of sorbent needed for a 500 MWel power plant was estimated to be similar to 100 kg/h at a hot gas temperature of 700 degreesC...|$|E
40|$|The modern {{production}} of aluminum which by its global output ranks first among the non-ferrous metals includes three main stages: ore extraction, its processing into alumina and, finally, the {{production of}} primary aluminum. Alumina production from bauxites,  being the  primary raw material in the  alumina industry,  is based  on two main methods: the Bayer method and the sintering method developed in Russia under the lead of an academician Nikolay Semenovich Kurnakov. Alumina production by the Bayer’s method is more cost effective,  but  has  higher  requirements to the  quality of the bauxite feedstock.   A great deal  of research has  been carried  out on low quality bauxites focusing firstly on finding ways to enrich the feedstock, secondly on improving the combined sequential Bayer-sintering method and thirdly on developing new hydrometallurgical ways for bauxites processing. Mechanical methods of bauxite enrichment have not yet brought any positive outcome, and a development of new hydrometallurgical high alkaline  autoclave process  faced  significant hardware  difficulties not addressed so far. For efficient processing of such low quality bauxite feedstock it is suggested to use a universal thermochemistry-Bayer method, which was developed in St. Petersburg Mining University under  the lead  of  Nikolay Ivanovich Eremin, allows to process different substandard bauxite feedstock and has a competitive costing {{as compared to the}} sintering method and combined methods. The main stages of thermochemistry-Bayer method are thermal activation of feedstock, its further desiliconization with the alkaline solution and leaching of the resultant bauxite product  under Bayer’s method. Despite high energy consumption at  the baking stage,  it  allows to condition the  low quality bauxite feedstock by neutralizing a variety of technologically harmful impurities such as organic matter, sulfide sulfur, carbonates, {{and at the same time}} to remove crystalline hydrate and free water. Subsequent desiliconization of thermally <b>activated</b> <b>bauxite</b> with an alkaline solution allows to regrade  it  from low quality bauxites to feedstock suitable for processing by the Bayer  method...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} made {{as it is}} {{submitted}} as a sum of published papers by the candidate. Aluminium hydroxides including gibbsite, boehmite and diaspore, are the major components, while iron hydroxides/oxides and kaolinite are the major impurities in bauxite. The dehydroxylation pathways during thermal activation of bauxite have been debated for decades. Phase transformation during thermal activation or calcination of bauxite to achieve high yields of alumina {{has been an important}} goal for the refining industry. This study deals with natural and synthetic aluminium and iron hydroxides using vibrational spectroscopy in conjunction with X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, followed by the characterisation of the phase transformation in <b>activated</b> <b>bauxite.</b> In the Raman spectra, gibbsite shows four bands at 3617, 3522, 3433 and 3364 cm- 1, and bayerite shows seven bands at 3664, 3652, 3552, 3542, 3450, 3438 and 3420 cm- 1 in the hydroxyl stretching region. Five bands at 3445, 3363, 3226, 3119 and 2936 cm- 1 for diaspore and four at 3371, 3220, 3085 and 2989 cm- 1 for boehmite are present. The far infrared spectrum of boehmite resembles that of diaspore in the 300 - 400 cm- 1 region. Boehmite has two characteristic bands at 366 and 323 cm- 1 while diaspore has five at 354, 331, 250, 199 and 158 cm- 1. The far infrared spectrum of gibbsite resembles that of bayerite in the 230 - 300 cm- 1 region. Gibbsite shows three characteristic bands at 371, 279 and 246 cm- 1 whereas bayerite shows six at 383, 345, 326, 296, 252 and 62 cm- 1. The far infrared spectra are in-harmony with the FT-Raman spectra, allowing the study and differentiation of the stretching of AlO 4 units to characterize these four alumina phases. The surface properties of kaolinite and gibbsite are studied using Fourier transform infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy (FTIR-PAS). The FTIR-PAS spectra of kaolinite are recorded at mirror velocities of 0. 05, 0. 1, and 0. 2 cm s- 1, and compared to the gibbsite spectra recorded at mirror velocity of 0. 2 cm s- 1. It is found that the hydroxyl surface spectra are a function of depth. For the FTIR spectroscopy of thermal dehydroxylation of goethite to form hematite, the intensity of hydroxyl stretching and bending vibrations decreased with the extent of dehydroxylation of goethite. Infrared absorption bands clearly show the phase transformation between goethite and hematite, in particular the migration of excess hydroxyl units from goethite to hematite. Data from the band component analysis of FT-IR spectra indicate that the hydroxyl units mainly affect the a- plane in goethite and the equivalent c- plane in hematite. A larger amount of non-stoichiometric hydroxyl unit is found to be associated with a higher aluminium substitution. A shift to a higher wavenumber of bending and hydroxyl stretching vibrations is attributed to the effects of aluminium substitution associated with non-stoichiometric hydroxyl units on the a-b plane relative to the b-c plane of goethite. The dehydroxylation pathways of both the aluminium hydroxides and the impurities are intensively studied. Gibbsite completely decomposed at 250 °C, followed by boehmite and kaolinite at 500 °C. No phase transformations were observed for hematite, anatase, rutile or quartz up to 800 °C. Small amounts of gibbsite transformed to boehmite but the majority transformed to chi (?) alumina, a disordered transition alumina phase, after dehydroxylation at 250 °C. The dehydroxylation pathways of crystalline gibbsite follow the orders: (a) gibbsite (< 250 °C) to boehmite (250 - 450 °C) to gamma alumina (?) (500 - 800 °C); or (b) gibbsite (< 250 °C) to chi alumina (?) (250 - 800 °C) to chi (?) + kappa alumina (?) (700 - 800 °C). Boehmite completely altered to gamma alumina (?), while kaolinite altered to metakaolinite at 500 °C. The vibrational spectroscopy including FT-IR and FT-Raman, is a rapid, accurate and non-destructive technique in characterising both single and mixed mineral phases. In particular, the vibrational spectroscopy has shown its advantages over other techniques in terms of its sensitivity to hydroxyl groups. Future work on the simulation of bauxite dehydroxylation with emphasis on the studies of transition aluminas is proposed. The application of the advanced technique synchrotron x-ray spectroscopy, in addition to those techniques used in the present study, is recommended...|$|E
40|$|New {{advanced}} {{combined cycle}} coal-fired power generation systems {{are dependent on}} improvements in gas turbine technology {{and the development of}} hot gas cleaning techniques. These techniques are not only necessary to meet environmentally accepted emission limits for SOx and NOx but also to prevent downstream equipment from corrosion and erosion. Volatile alkali vapours in the exhaust gases produced by either coal gasification or combustion lead to corrosion of the gas turbine blades resulting in reduced operating life. Consequently, alkali removal systems which can operate upstream of the gas turbine have been incorporated into the development of the clean coal technologies. A number of studies on alkali removal systems have been performed in the temperature range of 800 °C - 1000 °C. Solid aluminosilicates, such as emathlite, <b>activated</b> <b>bauxite,</b> kaolinite and Fuller's Earth, react with alkali vapours at high temperatures and therefore have been characterised as suitable alkali sorbents. Fuller's Earth was identified as potentially the most suitable sorbent for use in the UK at the specified operating temperatures. This material was studied in detail by McLaughlin (1990) for use in a fixed bed configuration within the British Coal Air-Blown Gasification Cycle. Recently, it has been recognised that if ceramic filters are used for the removal of fine particulates, operating temperatures for alkali sorption will have to drop to 400 °C- 600 °C, since these filters fail mechanically at higher temperatures. Much of the alkali will condense under these conditions and be removed by the filtration stages. However, the residual alkali levels may still exceed the revised turbine inlet specification of 24 ppb wt. Hence further studies of alkali sorption are required in this lower temperature region. During this work, it proved difficult to obtain accurate results at temperatures as low as 600 °C, because of the low level of vapour phase alkali. However, experiments were performed successfully at 650 °C and atmospheric pressure, on the fixed bed sorption rig used previously for tests at 827 °C and 927 °C. Tests comparing Fuller's Earth and kaolin, showed kaolin to have a higher sorption capacity at this temperature. Fixed bed tests with sodium and potassium were performed with Fuller's Earth pellets. The runs were of 200 - 600 hrs duration, with 4. 58 ppm wt NaCl (1. 8 ppm wt Na), 5 %vol H 2 O and up to 160 ppmv HCl in the inlet gas stream. Alkali uptake profiles were generated from chemical analysis of precise layers of pellets removed from the bed. Extensive modifications and improvements in analytical procedures enabled a closure of the mass balance of > 99 % to be achieved for a 600 hr run. Alkali exit levels measured using alumina wool filter pads in the exit gas were of the order of 5 - 6 ppb wt. Fuller's Earth pellets which had been pre-treated in gasifier gas and which were therefore contaminated with carbon, were tested and no difference was observed in their Na characteristics. Element mapping techniques based on Scanning Electron Microscopy, confirmed that a shrinking core model for Fuller's Earth grains and kaolin pellets was appropriate. The 'two-reaction' mechanism proposed by McLaughlin (1990), was used to fit the experimental results at 650 °C. Albite was identified by X-ray diffraction studies as the reaction product under high-acid conditions and nepheline under non-acid conditions. Exit gas analysis studies with an on-line monitor for HCl, showed the production of HCl to be directly connected with the presence of NaCl vapour and to increase significantly with the presence of water vapour in the system. However, the detailed reaction mechanism has not been identified yet. The theoretical model developed for the high temperature studies (McLaughlin, 1990), using the pellet-grain model and the 'tank-in-series' method of solution has been applied successfully at 650 °C. Parameters were extracted by curve fitting theoretical to experimental Na uptake concentration bed profiles. To test the numerical methods and the Szekely assumptions used in the McLaughlin program, two new computer programs were developed. The first, tested the pellet-grain model for a single pellet and the second was developed to solve the model more rigorously with a variable-order, variable-time-step numerical method. The new fixed bed model also incorporates the effects of temperature and pressure on selected parameters. It was used to predict the performance of a full-scale unit operating at 650 °C and 24 bara. The results indicate that a bed of Fuller's Earth pellets, 3 - 10 mm in diameter, 4 m long and 4 m wide can achieve exit alkali levels below 20 ppb wt in continuous operation for up to 24, 000 hrs...|$|E
