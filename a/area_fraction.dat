40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMechanical properties of two phase materials, such as strength, ductility and toughness, {{depend on the}} size and distribution of the second phase. However, no methods are presently available to accurately quantify the homogeneity {{of the distribution of}} the second phase. Random and non-random second phase particle distribution have been simulated by computer and analyzed for various <b>area</b> <b>fractions.</b> Distribution of particles with a lognormal size distribution have been analyzed as well. Statistically sufficient number of particles for use in the model was determined and used for all simulations. Average first nearer neighbor spacing values for dilute arrays of particles approach those of Poisson distributions of infinitesimal points. As the particle density increases, the average spacing values approach those of hexagonal arrays. For low <b>area</b> <b>fractions</b> there is little distinction between random and non-random distributions, both from statistical and visual perspectives. For higher <b>area</b> <b>fractions</b> there is a discernible difference between the statistical data for random and non-random distributions, but the visual differences are more obvious.

Using <b>area</b> <b>fractions</b> obtained from fluorescence images over a broad range of compositions, we constructed a phase diagram of the DPPC/DOPC/ergosterol system at 20 vol % ethanol.

This result supports the hypothesis that yeast cells increase ergosterol and unsaturated lipid content to prevent interdigitation and maintain an optimal membrane thickness as ethanol concentration increases during anaerobic fermentations.

50|$|Up until now, {{the focus}} has been mostly on the {{structure}} of the ice itself; the particles are almost an afterthought to the templating process but in fact, the particles can and do play a significant role during freeze-casting. It turns out that particle arrangement also changes {{as a function of the}} freezing conditions. For example, researchers have shown that freezing velocity has a marked effect on wall roughness. Faster freezing rates produce rougher walls since particles are given insufficient time to rearrange. This could be of use when developing permeable gas transfer membranes where tortuosity and roughness could impede gas flow. It also turns out that z- and r-crystals do not interact with ceramic particles in the same way. The z-crystals pack particles in the x-y plane while r-crystals pack particles primarily in the z-direction. R-crystals actually pack particles more efficiently than z-crystals and because of this, the <b>area</b> <b>fraction</b> of the particle-rich phase (1 - <b>area</b> <b>fraction</b> of ice crystals) changes as the crystal population shifts from a mixture of z- and r-crystals to only z-crystals. Starting from where ice crystals first begin to exclude particles, marking the beginning of the transition zone, we have a majority of r-crystals and a high value for the particle- rich phase fraction. We can assume that because the solidification speed is still rapid that the particles will not be packed efficiently. As the solidification rate slows down, however, the <b>area</b> <b>fraction</b> of the particle-rich phase drops indicating an increase in packing efficiency. At the same time, the competitive growth process is taking place, replacing r-crystals with z-crystals. At a certain point nearing the end of the transition zone, the particle-rich phase fraction rises sharply since z-crystals are less efficient at packing particles than r-crystals. The apex of this curve marks the point where only z-crystals are present (SSZ). During steady-state growth, after the maximum particle-rich phase fraction is reached, the efficiency of packing increases as steady-state is achieved. In 2011, researchers at Yale University set out to probe the actual spatial packing of particles within the walls. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) they characterized the particle size, shape and interparticle spacing of nominally 32 nm silica suspensions that had been freeze-cast at different speeds. Computer simulations indicated that for this system, the particles within the walls should not be touching but rather separated from one another by thin films of ice. Testing however revealed that the particles were, in fact, touching and more than that, they attained a packed morphology that cannot be explained by typical equilibrium densification processes.|$|E

Clustering has also been observed for colloidal particles composed of either an embedded hematite cube or slowly-diffusing metal ions. Clustering also occurs in enzyme molecule diffusion. In all these experiments, the motion of particles takes place on a two-dimensional surface and clustering is seen for <b>area</b> <b>fraction</b> as low as 10%. For such low area fractions, the clusters have a finite mean size while at larger area fractions, larger than 30%, a complete phase separation has been reported. The dynamics of the finite-size clusters are very rich, exhibiting either crystalline order or amorphous packing. The finite size of the clusters comes from a balance between attachment of new particles to pre-existing clusters and breakdown of large clusters into smaller ones, {{which has led to}} the term of [...] "living clusters".|$|E
