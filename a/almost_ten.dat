5|$|A {{few years}} later, in 1835 his native {{province}} of Rio Grande do Sul was engulfed in a secessionist rebellion, the Ragamuffin War. The conflict lasted for <b>almost</b> <b>ten</b> years, and the Count was leading military engagements {{for most of}} that time. He played a decisive role in saving the provincial capital from the Ragamuffin rebels, allowing forces loyal to the legitimate government to secure a key foothold. In 1852, he led a Brazilian division during the Platine War in an invasion of the Argentine Confederation that overthrew its dictator. He was awarded a noble title, eventually raised from baron to viscount and finally to count.|$|E

The other two, Dwayne Owen and Andre West, went on trial and were found unanimously guilty of murder by a jury. Although prosecutors had requested capital punishment in the case, the judge sentenced them to life in prison with a minimum of thirty years before becoming eligible for parole.|$|E
5|$|In Philadelphia, Rollins {{earned a}} {{reputation}} as an excellent defensive shortstop. In July 2001, Rollins became the Phillies' leadoff hitter, a role he retained for <b>almost</b> <b>ten</b> years. He made three All-Star Game appearances early in his career. While a Phillie, Rollins compiled a 38-game hitting streak, which spanned the end of the 2005 season and the start of the 2006 season, the longest in team history. Rollins was named the National League Most Valuable Player in 2007, as the Phillies won their division in the first of five consecutive seasons. He was also a key component of the 2008 World Series champion team. In his final season with the Phillies, he became the franchise's all-time leader in hits.

5|$|Booth was {{selected}} for the Australian team that toured England in 1961 and played {{in the final two}} Tests. Upon his return to Australia, Booth made two centuries in the 196263 home Test series against England, establishing himself in the Test team. He made two further centuries the following summer against South Africa and was named the Australian player of the year. Following the retirement of Richie Benaud, Booth was appointed vice-captain under Simpson as Australia embarked on a successful 1964 tour of England, which saw the retention of the Ashes. Booth played his final Test series in 196566 against England, captaining Australia in the First and Third Tests because Simpson was sidelined with a broken wrist and chickenpox respectively. The First Test was drawn but Australia fell to its first innings defeat in <b>almost</b> <b>ten</b> years in the Third Test. As he was also in a form slump, Booth was dropped as the Australian selectors made mass changes, ending his career. In retirement, Booth returned to his teaching duties and served as an Anglican lay-preacher. He was inducted into the Cricket NSW Hall of Fame in 2014.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>almost</b> <b>ten</b> {{years it}} served as the capitol, Congress Hall {{witnessed}} many historic events including the admittance of three new states. The United States Bill of Rights was ratified at Congress Hall in 1791. The second Presidential inauguration of George Washington {{took place in the}} House chamber in 1793, as did inauguration of John Adams in 1797. Congress also used the time to establish the First Bank of the United States, the Federal Mint, and the United States Department of the Navy. The Jay Treaty, which secured a temporary peace with Great Britain, was also ratified at Congress Hall in 1796. After the capital moved to Washington, Congress Hall returned to its original function as the Philadelphia County Courthouse and served as the location of both state and federal courts during the early 19th century. Also designed by Samuel Lewis, the Burlington County Courthouse in Mount Holly Township, New Jersey was built in 1796 and modeled after Congress Hall.|$|E

At its height in the Late Preclassic, the population has been estimated at 1600 in the site core with a further 8000 dispersed through the periphery, to produce an estimated total population of <b>almost</b> <b>ten</b> thousand. In the Early Classic the population suffered a severe decline, population is estimated to have dropped to 34% of peak population. In the Late to Terminal Classic the population increased to 85% of its Late Preclassic level, an expansion {{that appears to have}} occurred rapidly and spread to all parts of the site, perhaps as the result of an influx of refugees arriving from other sites around AD 830. This was followed by a population crash to 14% of peak Preclassic population in the Early Postclassic (AD 9001200) prior to the complete abandonment of the site.|$|E
5|$|The allotropes {{of carbon}} include graphite, {{one of the}} softest known substances, and diamond, the hardest {{naturally}} occurring substance. It bonds readily with other small atoms including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming multiple stable covalent bonds with suitable, multivalent atoms. Carbon is known to form <b>almost</b> <b>ten</b> million different compounds, {{a large majority of}} all chemical compounds. Carbon also has the highest sublimation point of all elements. At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 Â± 0.2MPa and 4,600 Â± 300 K (~4,330Â°C or 7,820Â°F), so it sublimes at about 3,900K. Graphite is much more reactive than diamond at standard conditions, despite being more thermodynamically stable, as its delocalised pi system is much more vulnerable to attack. For example, graphite can be oxidised by hot concentrated nitric acid at standard conditions to mellitic acid, C6(CO2H)6, which preserves the hexagonal units of graphite while breaking up the larger structure.|$|E

5|$|Titan uses Jaguar's 200 cabinets, {{covering}} 404 square meters (4,352 ft2), with replaced internals and upgraded networking. Reusing Jaguar's {{power and}} cooling systems saved approximately $20 million. Power is provided to each cabinet at three-phase 480 V. This requires thinner cables than the US standard 208 V, saving $1 million in copper. At its peak, Titan draws 8.2 MW, 1.2 MW more than Jaguar, but runs <b>almost</b> <b>ten</b> {{times as fast}} in terms of floating point calculations. In {{the event of a}} power failure, carbon fiber flywheel power storage can keep the networking and storage infrastructure running for up to 16 seconds. After 2 seconds without power, diesel generators fire up, taking approximately 7 seconds to reach full power. They can provide power indefinitely. The generators are designed only to keep the networking and storage components powered so that a reboot is much quicker; the generators are not capable of powering the processing infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, 76â77 {{per cent}} of output by value was {{livestock}} farming and, although this {{has fallen to}} about 64 per cent since 1990, arable farming remains {{a minority of the}} sector and two-thirds of agricultural land is rough pasture. One result is that chemicalisation and arable-based subsidies have had less impact on Scottish biodiversity than is the case in England where farming is overwhelmingly arable. The UK membership of the European Economic Community (later the European Union) in 1972 began a re-orientation for Scottish farming. A preference for Commonwealth markets was replaced by EU obligations. Agriculture became dominated by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU, which made farming dependent on market support and direct grants to farmers. As a result, some sectors, particularly hill sheep farming, became viable only with subsidies. Eight-four per cent of Scottish land qualified for extra support as a Less Favoured Area (LFA), but 80 per cent of the payments were going to only 20 per cent of the farmers, mainly large commercial arable farms in the Lowlands. A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. As part of an attempt to mitigate the depopulation and commercialisation of Scottish farming, the Crofting Act of 1976 made it easier for crofters to buy their farms, but most were insufficient to support a family, and many small farmers turned to fish farming and tourism to supplement their incomes. A dual farm structure has emerged with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings. Scotland has the highest average farm size in the European Union, <b>almost</b> <b>ten</b> times the average.|$|E
