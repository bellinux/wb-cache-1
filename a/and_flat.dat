5|$|Bristol's {{boundaries}} are defined in several ways, {{depending on whether}} they {{are those of the}} city, the developed area, or Greater Bristol.

5|$|Broaching is {{used when}} {{precision}} machining is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, keyways, <b>and</b> <b>flat</b> surfaces. Typical workpieces include small to medium-sized castings, forgings, screw machine parts, and stampings. Even though broaches can be expensive, broaching is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity production runs.|$|E
40|$|Extracting {{drainage}} networks from raster DEMs is {{a necessary}} requirement in almost all hydrological and environmental analyses and determining surface water flow direction is a fundamental problem. In a raster environment, surface water flow direction of each cell can be directed to the neighboring cell with the steepest downslope drop (The basic D 8, deterministic eight-neighbour method), which is inadequate for routing flow over pits <b>and</b> <b>flats.</b> Several improved algorithms are proposed to find the outlet of pits <b>and</b> <b>flats,</b> which typically use entirely different procedures for processing pits <b>and</b> <b>flats.</b> Being different from others, this paper presents a new method to route flow through the pits <b>and</b> <b>flats</b> by searching for the outlet using the heuristic information to compensate inadequate searching information of other methods. Heuristic information can reveal the general trend of the DEM and help the proposed algorithm find the outlet of pits <b>and</b> <b>flats</b> accurately. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can handle pits <b>and</b> <b>flats</b> effectively in one procedure. This new algorithm is implemented in Pascal and experiments are carried out on actual DEM data. It {{can be seen from}} the comparison of the drainage networks generated by the proposed algorithm and ArcGIS 9. 2, the proposed algorithm with heuristic information can get a closer match result with existing river networks and avoid the generation of the unrealistic parallel drainage lines, unreal drainage lines and spurious terrain features...|$|R

5|$|Identified {{risk factors}} for plantar {{fasciitis}} include excessive running, standing on hard surfaces for prolonged periods of time, high arches of the feet, {{the presence of a}} leg length inequality, <b>and</b> <b>flat</b> feet. The tendency of flat feet to excessively roll inward during walking or running makes them more susceptible to plantar fasciitis. Obesity is seen in 70% of individuals who present with plantar fasciitis and is an independent risk factor.|$|E

5|$|Pennatomys nivalis was a {{medium-sized}} species without many distinctive adaptations. The nasal bones were short and blunt-ended.

5|$|Two plants {{found near}} Twilight Cove are {{regarded}} as hybrids between A.cuneatus and A.forrestii, the only two Adenanthos species {{to occur in the}} area. One was discovered by Nelson in 1972, the other by Alex George in 1974. They are about 5km apart, and differ somewhat. The leaves are triangular <b>and</b> <b>flat</b> like those of A.cuneatus, but the leaves of mature shoots are very long and narrow, and the leaves of younger shoots are deeply lobed.|$|E
40|$|Ramps <b>and</b> <b>flats</b> of mass {{transport}} deposits are commonly studied on seismic profiles as kinematic indicators. In this study, ramps <b>and</b> <b>flats</b> {{on the margin}} of salt diapirs are mapped in a high quality 3 D seismic volume from SE Brazil (Espírito Santo Basin). Our aim is to test how differently oriented ramps <b>and</b> <b>flats</b> at the basal shear surface of specific MTD interval {{can be used to}} infer the direction of mass flow. Statistical analysis of thickness variation of the {{mass transport}} deposit within depocentre created by ramps <b>and</b> <b>flats</b> was estimated along slope in order to elucidate the mode of emplacement of the associated MTD. Sliding at the plane of failure is enhanced by seafloor faulting and nearby halokinesis. Ramps significantly contribute to local changes in gradient at the basal shear surfaces, as they are linked to promontories (Type I) and paleo-fault scarps (Type II) ...|$|R

5|$|Allosaurus was {{the most}} common large {{theropod}} in the vast tract of Western American fossil-bearing rock known as the Morrison Formation, accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens, and as such was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, <b>and</b> <b>flat</b> floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II over 350 soldiers of the Royal Artillery were stationed on the island. Flat Holm was re-armed with four 4.5-inch guns and associated searchlights for anti-aircraft and close defence, together with two 40mm Bofors guns. A GL (Gun Laying) Mk II radar station was also placed in {{the centre of the}} island. The structures formed part of the Fixed Defences, and protected the Atlantic shipping convoys between Cardiff, Barry, <b>and</b> <b>Flat</b> Holm. These works were abandoned after the war and the island has had no military use since. Flat Holm's helipad still remains, however, at the centre of the island.|$|E
5|$|Both Steep Holm <b>and</b> <b>Flat</b> Holm were {{fortified}} in the 1860s as a defence against invasion. They {{form part}} {{of a line of}} defences, known as Palmerston Forts, built across the channel to protect the approaches to Bristol and Cardiff. The island was fortified following a visit by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to France, where they had been concerned at the strength of the French Navy. The Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, under the direction of Lord Palmerston, recommended fortification of the coast, and the island formed part of this strategic coastal defence system. Construction began in 1865 and was completed in 1869 by John Perry of Weston-super-Mare. The work involved the creation of a perimeter road around the summit plateau and a lime kiln for the manufacture of lime mortar to build the barracks and gun emplacements with their ammunition stores.|$|E
