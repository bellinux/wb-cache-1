5|$|A {{string of}} forts was {{constructed}} in the north-east (some of which may date from the earlier Antonine campaign). These include camps associated with the Elsick Mounth, such as Normandykes, Ythan Wells, Deers Den and Glenmailen. However, only two forts in Scotland, at Cramond and Carpow (in the Tay valley) <b>are</b> <b>definitely</b> {{known to have been}} permanently occupied during this incursion before the troops were withdrawn again to Hadrian's Wall circa 213. There is some evidence that these campaigns are coincident with the wholesale destruction and abandonment of souterrains in southern Scotland. This may have been due either to Roman military aggression or the collapse of local grain markets in the wake of Roman withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|Roman troops {{penetrated}} {{far into}} the north of modern Scotland several more times, with at least four major campaigns. The Antonine Wall was occupied again {{for a brief period}} after 197 CE. The most notable invasion was in 209 when the emperor Septimius Severus led a major campaign. A string of forts was constructed in the north-east (some of which may have been begun in the earlier Antonine campaign). These include camps associated with the Elsick Mounth, such as Normandykes, Ythan Wells, Deers Den and Glenmailen.

There is evidence that these campaigns are coincident with the wholesale destruction and abandonment of souterrains in southern Scotland. This may have been due either to Roman military aggression or the collapse of local grain markets in the wake of Roman withdrawal. After the death of Severus in 210 the Romans withdrew back to Hadrian's Wall, which would be the frontier until Roman authority in Britain collapsed in the fifth century.|$|E

25|$|The majestic Stalinallee in Berlin, also {{completed}} in 1961, was conceived in 1952, and didn't {{have too much}} to lose: the scale and bulk of these buildings <b>are</b> <b>definitely</b> Stalinist, but the modest finishes are similar to Jugendstil and Prussian Neoclassicism. The street would later be extended in an International Style idiom and renamed Karl-Marx-Allee.|$|E

25|$|Animals that {{hibernate}} {{are in a}} {{state of}} torpor, differing from sleep. Hibernation markedly reduces the need for sleep, but does not remove it. Some hibernating animals end their hibernation a couple of times during the winter so that they can sleep. Hibernating animals waking up from hibernation often go into rebound sleep because of lack of sleep during the hibernation period. They <b>are</b> <b>definitely</b> well-rested and are conserving energy during hibernation, but need sleep for something else.|$|E
25|$|Samuel's {{wife was}} called Agatha, {{and was the}} {{daughter}} of the magnate of Dyrrhachium John Chryselios. Only two of Samuel's and Agatha's children <b>are</b> <b>definitely</b> known by name: Samuel's heir Gavril Radomir and Miroslava. Two further, unnamed daughters, are mentioned after the Bulgarian surrender in 1018, while Samuel is also recorded as having had a bastard son. Another woman, Kosara, who was wedded to Jovan Vladimir of Duklja and was considered by earlier scholarship as Samuel's daughter, is now regarded to have been simply a relative, perhaps a niece of Agatha. Gavril Radomir married twice, to Ilona of Hungary and Irene from Larissa. Miroslava married the captured Byzantine noble Ashot Taronites.|$|E
25|$|Herodotus {{says that}} the Neuri had Scythian customs, but they were at first not {{considered}} Scythian. During the war between the Scythians and the Persian Empire, the Scythians came to dominate the Neuri. Strabo, younger contemporary of Pytheas, denies that any knowledge of {{the shores of the}} eastern Baltic existed. He had heard of the Sauromatai, but had no idea where to place them. Herodotus had mentioned these Sauromatai as a distinct people living near the Neuri. Pliny the Elder, however, is much better informed. The island of Baunonia (Bornholm), he says lies a days' sail off Scythia, where amber is collected. To him the limit of Germany is the Vistula. In contrast to Strabo, he knows that the Goths live around the Vistula, but these <b>are</b> <b>definitely</b> Germans.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} {{licensed}} from both Danjaq/Eon Productions, which holds the film rights, and Glidrose Publications (now Ian Fleming Publications), which holds the literary rights, {{and tried to}} be as faithful as possible to both the books and the films as circumstances permitted. However, to challenge the players appropriately, key plot elements in the modules based on the films were changed with the open warning to players that exactly imitating Bond's choices and actions in the film's original story would be dangerous. For instance, in the module for Live and Let Die, the players learn that Mr. Big and Doctor Kanaga <b>are</b> <b>definitely</b> two separate people rather than Kanaga playing the New York gangster in disguise. In addition, the module for You Only Live Twice is largely rewritten to change the outdated space hijacking scheme to a plot to investigate the crash of a Soviet space station that crashes near Japan {{and deal with the}} reported bioweapons being researched on board.|$|E

500|$|Diamonds are carbon {{crystals}} {{that form}} {{deep within the}} Earth under high temperatures and extreme pressures. At surface air pressure (one atmosphere), diamonds are not as stable as graphite, and so the decay of diamond is thermodynamically favorable (δH=−2kJ/mol). So, contrary to De Beers' ad campaign extending from 1948 to at least 2013 under the slogan [...] "A diamond is forever", diamonds <b>are</b> <b>definitely</b> not forever. However, owing to a very large kinetic energy barrier, diamonds are metastable; they will not decay into graphite under normal conditions.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Brian Grazer tweeted in April 2011 {{that the}} film was planned for a 2012 release.

In September 2011, Sutherland indicated the script was almost complete. After some small script alterations by screenwriter Mark Bomback, filming was announced to begin in spring 2012, after Sutherland became available in April.|$|E

500|$|Taborn has {{commented on}} the {{similarities}} and differences in his playing on piano and electronic instruments. Comparing his accompaniments on piano and Fender Rhodes, he said that: I play some of the same chords on the piano, but there <b>are</b> <b>definitely</b> things I would do on the piano because it's a more transparent instrument that I wouldn't do on the Rhodes. [...] The Rhodes is so strong that when you play something on it, it really can dictate, because it's louder and the timbre is much more opaque. So you leave more holes. On the piano, I would maybe play more sustain chords.|$|E
500|$|In March 2008, Bleeding Through {{announced}} Declaration as {{the title}} of its fifth studio release, a concept album about the rigors of being away from home.

The original prints of Doppelgänger position Ian Hendry before Roy Thinnes in the opening credits; in the Journey to the Far Side of the Sun format, Thinnes is billed before Hendry. Certain UK prints alter the final scene featuring the old Jason Webb {{with the addition of}} a short voice-over from Thinnes in character as Ross, who is heard speaking a line that he says to Webb earlier in the film: [...] "Jason, we were right.
