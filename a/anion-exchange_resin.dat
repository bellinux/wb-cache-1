50|$|The {{isoelectric point}} is the pH at which a {{compound}} - {{in this case a}} protein - has no net charge. A protein’s isoelectric point or PI can be determined using the pKa of the side chains, if the amino (positive chain) is able to cancel out the carboxyl (negative) chain, the protein would be at its PI. Using buffers instead of water for proteins that do not have a charge at pH 7, is a good idea as it enables the manipulation of pH to alter ionic interactions between the proteins and the beads. Weakly acid or basic side chains (such as in leucine, proline, alanine, valine, glycine…etc.) are able to have a charge if the pH is high enough to deprotonate the amino group. Separation can be achieved based on the natural isoelectric point of the protein. Alternatively a peptide tag can be genetically added to the protein to give the protein an isoelectric point away from most natural proteins (e.g., 6 arginines for binding to a cation-exchange resin or 6 glutamates for binding to an <b>anion-exchange</b> <b>resin</b> such as DEAE-Sepharose).|$|E
50|$|MARS is an extracorporeal {{hemodialysis}} system {{composed of}} three different circuits: blood, albumin and low-flux dialysis. The blood circuit uses a double lumen catheter and a conventional hemodialysis device to pump the patient’s blood into the MARS FLUX, a biocompatible polysulfone high-flux dialyser. With a membrane surface area of 2.1 m2, 100 nm of thickness and a cut-off of 50 KDa, the MARSFLUX is essential to retaining the albumin in the dialysate. Blood is dialysed against a human serum albumin (HSA) dialysate solution that allows blood detoxification of both water-soluble and protein-bound toxins, {{by means of the}} presence of albumin in the dialysate (albumin dialysis). The albumin dialysate is then regenerated in a close loop in the MARS circuit by passing through the fibres of the low-flux diaFLUX filter, to clear water-soluble toxins and provide electrolyte/acid-base balance, by a standard dialysis fluid. Next, the albumin dialysate passes through two different adsorption columns; protein-bound substances are removed by the diaMARS AC250, containing activated charcoal and anionic substances are removed by the diaMARS IE250, filled with cholestyramine, an <b>anion-exchange</b> <b>resin.</b> The albumin solution is then ready to initiate another detoxifying cycle of the patient's blood that can be sustained until both adsorption columns are saturated, eliminating the need to continuously infuse albumin into the system during treatment (Fig. 1).|$|E

40|$|Background]: One of {{the most}} {{promising}} uses of whey permeate (WP) is the synthesis of prebiotic oligosaccharides. Herein, commercial WP was submitted to chemical isomerization catalysed by sodium borate at an alkaline pH and subsequent purification using <b>anion-exchange</b> <b>resins</b> to remove boron. Subsequently, purified mixtures were used to synthesize prebiotic oligosaccharides using β-galactosidase from Bacillus circulans. [Results]: Isomerization of concentrated WP (200 [*]g[*]L− 1 lactose) gave rise to levels of lactulose up to 155. 5 [*]g[*]L− 1 after 30 [*]min of reaction (molar ratio of boron/lactose, 1 / 1; pH 12; 70 [*]°C). Boron was removed from the isomerized WP (IWP) using the combination of a strong acid (IR- 120, H+) and a weak base (IRA- 743) <b>anion-exchange</b> <b>resins,</b> reducing its level to < 1 [*]ppm, without loss of lactulose. During the transglycosylation reaction of purified IWP (lactose/lactulose ratio, 1 / 2. 4) maximum content of prebiotic compounds was achieved, i. e. 690 [*]g[*]kg− 1 WP after 3 [*]h of reaction. [Conclusion]: This study shows that combined chemical–enzymatic reactions together with the purification of IWP results in an efficient synthesis of prebiotic oligosaccharides.

Though the raw material of biodiesel is renewable and carbon neutral, in the conventional method the product is contaminated with the homogeneous alkali catalyst. Hence, the application of the <b>anion-exchange</b> <b>resin</b> was used as the solid base catalyst. While the method of using the <b>anion-exchange</b> <b>resin</b> has already been reported, a problem in durability remains.

Blank experiments (without addition of Pb(NO 3) (2) solutions to the pots) were also run. There {{were no significant differences in}} the growth of the plants with the addition of Pb(NO 3) (2) solutions in either of the transpirations studies. Uptake of Pb by the shoots and roots of the plants was found to be proportional to the concentration of Pb solutions added, and more accumulation was observed in the roots than in the shoots at the end of days 3 and 10. High transpiration caused more Pb uptake than did low transpiration. One volatile acid (propionic acid) and nine nonvolatile acids (lactic, glycolic, oxalic, succinic, fumaric, oxalacetiC, D-tartaric, trans-aconitic, and citric acids) in rhizosphere quartz sand or <b>anion-exchange</b> <b>resin</b> were identified and quantified by gas chromatography analysis with a flame ionization detector.

A certain amount of <b>anion-exchange</b> <b>resin</b> could neutralize the low pH values (pH 2 - 5) and maintain the system around pH 7. 0. This means the anion-exchange resins have the function of neutralizing reagent in the process of adsorbing succinic acid...|$|E
40|$|<b>Resin</b> denitration via <b>anion-exchange</b> is an {{implementable}} {{process that}} can effectively mitigate the hazards associated with stored resins in which {{the bulk of the}} nitrate consists of an "exchangeable nitrate" ionically bound to the cationic sites of the <b>anion-exchange</b> <b>resins.</b> Salicylate has been selected as the exchange anion of choice because of its superior selectivity for the Rocky Flats resins and its unique potential for comprehensive recovery and recycle. This report outlines a single recommended resin denigration procedure that is reasonably independent of the resin composition and the current stored form. This procedure is not optimized but rather seeks to `over-treat' the resins so that a single procedure works for the variety of stored resins. The recommended treatment with sodium salicylate reduces resins by 95 - 99 +% the measured exothermic behavior of the ion-exchange...|$|R
40|$|Electrically conductive, <b>anion-exchange</b> {{polyaniline}} <b>resins</b> {{are prepared}} by one-step redox polymerization of aniline with ammonium persulphate, potassium dichromate, cerium(IV) sulphate, or sodium vanadate. The resulting polymers {{are characterized by}} solid-state techniques, viz. conductivity, C- 13 cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CPMAS) NMR, and thermogravimetric studies. The polymers are used for binary and tertiary separations...|$|R
40|$|Today {{the rapid}} {{isolation}} of pure DNA samples {{is supported by}} a large number of commercial kits. These kits contain high affin-ity DNA-binding materials and all reagents for binding, purifica-tion, and elution. The two major DNA-binding materials integrated into these products are pure silica-matrices or silica-based <b>anion-exchange</b> <b>resins</b> [1]. The very different physical characteristics of these two DNA-binding materials require different buffer systems and protocols for purification (see Table 1 for a comparison). Recently, maxXbond, the first regeneration system optimized for pure silica matrices has been developed [1, 2]. maxXbond al-lows a substantial cost reduction for DNA purification by the mul-tiple usage of silica matrices. Here we present maxXbond AX, the optimized regeneration kit for the multiple usage of silica-based anion exchange resins. The kit is based on the two regeneration buffers, RG 1 -AX and RG 2...|$|R
