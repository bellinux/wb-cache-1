40|$|Effect of <b>anti-anginal</b> <b>drugs</b> on the {{distribution}} of blood flow in the left ventricular free wall has been studied using thirty anesthetized open-chest dogs. The regional myocardial blood flows in the inner-(subendocardial) and outer-(sub-epicardial) layer were continuously monitored by heated cross-thermocouples designed according to Grayson's heat exchange principle. The techniques used were essentially the same as that described by Uchida (1970). The antianginal drug (nitroglycerin, 20 μg/Kg; prenylamine, 1 mg/Kg; dipyridamole, 0. 3 mg/Kg; or dilazep, 0. 2 mg/Kg) was administered intravenously. The results were as follows: (1) No difference in the regional myocardial blood flow between the inner- and outer-layer was observed. The flow ratio of the inner- to the outer-layer (I/O ratio) was 0. 97 ± 0. 17. (2) Nitroglycerin produced a slight decrease in the flow through the inner-layer in spite of a remarkable drop in coronary perfusion pressure, while it did a marked decrease through the outer-layer. As the result, I/O ratio was significantly elevated after the injection. (3) Prenylamine produced a moderate increase in the flow through the both layers in spite of a remarkable fall in the coronary perfusion pressure. The ratio was rather elevated after a significant initial decline. (4) Dipyridamole caused a marked increase in the flow through the both layers, whereas I/O ratio was only minimaly lowered. (5) A change similar to that caused by dipyridamole was observed except a slight elevation of the ratio from 20 to 30 minutes when dilazep was injected. As mentioned above, these <b>anti-anginal</b> <b>drugs</b> produced different effects on the flow in the both layers. One of the explanation of these differences observed might be that these drugs have different effects on sites of coronary vessels, large intramural conductive vessels or small resistive vessels. Another explanation could be that these drugs cause different effects on the systemic hemodynamics. For the studies on effect of <b>anti-anginal</b> <b>drugs</b> on the intramyocardial distribution of blood flow, it is necessary that the regional myocardial blood flow must be monitored continuously since the intramyocardial distribution of the blood flow can be changed from time to time after the administration...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT – Chronic stable angina is {{the most}} common manifestation of ischaemic heart disease in the {{developed}} world and is associated with impaired quality of life and increased mortality. The pathogenesis of stable angina is complex and often, albeit not always, involves flow-limiting epicardial coronary artery stenoses (atheromatous plaques) that reduce the ability of the coronary circulation to deliver appropriate blood supply to the myocardium. The coronary microcirculation can also play an important role. An imbal-ance between myocardial oxygen supply and metabolic oxygen demand causes the symptoms of angina pectoris and represents a major therapeutic target. Rational treat-ment requires a multi-faceted approach combining lifestyle changes, aggressive management of modifiable coronary artery disease risk factors, pharmacological therapy and myocardial revascularisation when appropriate. Despite modern therapies, many patients continue to suffer from angina. Several new <b>anti-anginal</b> <b>drugs</b> have been intro-duced that might allow more effective symptom control. These novel agents have specific mechanisms of action and fewer side effects compared to conventional drugs. The com-bined use of traditional and novel treatments is likely to increase the proportion of patients who are managed suc-cessfully with medical therapy alone. This article briefly reviews recent advances in the pharmacological manage-ment of chronic stable angina pectoris, highlighting how an understanding of the prevailing pathogenic mechanisms in the individual patient can aid appropriate selection of thera-peutic strategies and improve clinical outcome...|$|E

40|$|Safety {{has been}} {{assessed}} {{in a total}} of 1680 subjects who were treated with nicorandil, with 458 patient years of exposure to treatment. Adverse events usually occurred early in the course of treatment. After 30 days of treatment, fewer than 10 % of patients reported adverse events. At the recommended doses, the main side effects were limited to headaches. Nearly all episodes of headache were experienced during the first days of nicorandil treatment and were responsible for most of the study withdrawals because of clinical non-acceptability. The incidence can be diminished by a progressive titration. In comparative trials with anti-anginal agents, such as propranolol, diltiazem, nifedipine, ISDN and isosorbide 5 mononitrate, the overall incidence of adverse events was not significantly different between nicorandil and the reference drug. Side-effect distribution was comparable between nicorandil (32 %) and diltiazem (30 %). Nicorandil can be safely combined with other <b>anti-anginal</b> <b>drugs.</b> Furthermore, due to its favourable pharmacokinetics, nicorandil is less likely to have interactions when combined with another therapeutic agent. Nearly one-third of the patients enrolled in the nicorandil clinical programme were 65 years old or older.

However, there is still concern about its safety, Objective To investigate the reliability, morbidity, and mortality aspects of SCS in patients with refractory angina pectoris by studying the predictors of outcome, defined by efficacy, adverse events and mortality, in patients with CAD and SCS. Methods Fifty-seven patients (18 women) treated with SCS, aged 59. 8 +/- 7. 6 years (mean +/- SD) were studied retrospectively. They had suffered from manifest CAD for 9. 4 +/- 4. 9 years; 46 of them had experienced a myocardial infarction prior to the implantation; 28 had had a previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty; and 52 had undergone coronary artery bypass surgery, The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 51. 8 +/- 13. 8 %, All of the patients were being treated with two or three <b>anti-anginal</b> <b>drugs.</b> Results During 2042 patient-months follow-up, nine of the 57 patients died (annual mortality rate 6. 5 %). The percentage of adverse events requiring reprogramming or surgical reintervention was reduced from 83 % for 18 patients with the Medtronic ITREL(R) lead to 33 % for 39 patients with the ITREL II system, The clinical outcome was correlated positively with a left ventricular ejection fraction > 40 % (P= 0. 0005), and negatively with a high cholesterol level (P= 0. 0042), more prior revascularizations (P= 0. 028), and a higher New York Heart Association classification (P= 0. 04).

40|$|According to the 2006 Health Survey for England, angina affects 8 % {{of men and}} 3 % {{of women}} aged 55 - 64 {{increasing}} to 14 % and 8 % respectively for those aged 65 - 74. It is important to reassure patients with clinically significant coronary artery disease, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, that for most lifestyle modification and optimal medical therapy will prove sufficient treatment. However, a minority of patients may also require intervention by stents or surgery. It is vital that patients with obvious precipitating factors that may promote or aggravate underlying coronary artery disease address these with lifestyle changes. Smoking should be stopped and a balanced diet and regular exercise encouraged. Advice should be given on factors that aggravate angina e. g. cold weather, heavy exercise and emotional stress. Advice about physical exertion and sexual activity should be included. A short-acting nitrate for angina prevention and treatment of episodes of angina is recommended. It should be used prophylactically in advance of any exertion. In terms of secondary prevention, basic therapy includes aspirin and a statin and antihypertensive agents for those with higher blood pressure. Optimal drug therapy consists of two <b>anti-anginal</b> <b>drugs,</b> such as a beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker as first-line treatment and in preference to other drug therapy unless there are side-effects or contraindications to these.

This should be explained to patients who should be offered further investigation if they wish and should certainly be encouraged in younger patients.

Unless a significant volume of myocardium (> 10 %) is at risk from ischaemia, there may be no prognostic benefit from revascularisation.

40|$|Stable angina is a {{sensation}} of discomfort or {{pain in the}} chest, arm, or jaw brought on predictably by factors that increase myocardial oxygen demand, such as exertion, and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. 						Stable angina is usually caused by coronary atherosclerosis, and affects up to 16 % of men and 10 % of women aged 65 - 74 years in the UK. Risk factors include hypertension, elevated serum cholesterol levels, smoking, physical inactivity, and overweight. People with angina {{are at increased risk}} of other cardiovascular events and mortality compared with people without angina. Among people not thought to need coronary artery revascularisation, annual mortality is 1 - 2 % and annual non-fatal MI rates are 2 - 3 %. We found no long-term, adequately powered RCTs of <b>anti-anginal</b> <b>drugs</b> versus placebo or comparing the use of a single anti-anginal drug versus combinations of anti-anginal drug classes. There is a consensus that monotherapy with beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and potassium channel openers are effective for treating the symptoms of stable angina in the long term, although we found few studies to confirm this. There is also consensus that the concurrent use of two of these classes of drug has an additional beneficial effect on anginal symptoms and quality of life. It has not been established that this approach reduces cardiovascular events. Monotherapy with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers seems equally effective at reducing angina attacks, and they are equally well tolerated in the long term. Adding a calcium channel blocker to existing anti-anginal drug treatments slightly reduces the need for coronary artery surgery, but has no effect on other cardiovascular events. Monotherapy with nitrates may be as effective as monotherapy with calcium channel blockers at reducing angina attacks and improving quality of life. We found no RCTs on the effects of long-term monotherapy with potassium channel openers in people with stable angina, but a large RCT of a potassium channel opener as an adjunct to existing anti-anginal drug treatments found a reduction the number of cardiovascular events compared with placebo...|$|E
40|$|The Circadian Anti-Ischemic Program in Europe (CAFE) {{trial was}} a large, {{multinational}} trial, {{taking place in}} ten countries and involving over 100 investigators. It was a double-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing once-daily amlodipine with placebo in chronic stable angina pectoris. It consisted of two phases, the first being a 2 -week, single-blind, placebo run-in phase during which stable doses of <b>anti-anginal</b> <b>drugs</b> were maintained (65 % of patients were receiving beta-blockers), and the second an 8 -week active treatment phase in which patients received either amlodipine or placebo, 5 mg once daily, for the first 4 weeks, increasing to 10 mg once daily for the second 4 weeks. Patients were randomized in a ratio of 2 patients receiving amlodipine to each patient receiving placebo. Out of an initial 1, 160 patients screened, 315 entered the study, with 250 having complete efficacy-evaluable data. Patients were included if they experienced {{greater than or equal}} to 4 ambulatory ECG ischemic episodes ({{greater than or equal to}} 1 mm ST-segment depression for greater than or equal to 1 min) and/or greater than or equal to 20 min total ischemia time over 48 h. Data were obtained on the total frequency of ST-segment depression events, the ischemia area (ST-segment depression integral), the ischemic time and peak ST-segment depression. Patient diary information on angina attack rate and nitroglycerin tablet consumption was also collected. Patients in both groups were compared for age, blood pressure, heart rate, duration of angina and baseline ischemia at entry. Amlodipine and placebo had similar safety profiles, with 17. 3 % of amlodipine patients recording adverse events, compared with 13. 3 % of placebo patients. Angina pectoris was noted as a complaint by 2 % of patients receiving amlodipine, compared with 3. 5 % receiving placebo. Edema was noted in 5. 4 % of amlodipine patients and 1. 8 % of placebo patients and headache was reported by 2. 5 % of amlodipine patients and 0. 9 % of placebo patients. In general, complaints were not severe and the withdrawal rate was low (amlodipine 2 %, placebo 4 %). None of the above differences was statistically significant. In conclusion, the baseline demographic and ischemic profiles for patients receiving either amlodipine or placebo were similar. Amlodipine was very well tolerated, as shown by a safety profile similar to that of placebo and a low withdrawal rate from the study...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The re-purposing of the <b>anti-anginal</b> <b>drug</b> {{perhexiline}} (PHX) {{has resulted}} in symptomatic improvements in heart failure (HF) patients. The inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase- 1 (CPT- 1) has been proposed as the primary mechanism underlying the therapeutic benefit of PHX. This hypothesis is contentious. Areas covered We reviewed the primary literature and patent landscape of PHX from its initial development in the 1960 s through to its emergence as a drug beneficial for HF. We focused on its physico-chemistry, molecular targets, tissue accumulation and clinical dosing. Expert opinion Dogma that the beneficial effects of PHX are due primarily to potent myocardial CPT- 1 inhibition is {{not supported by the}} literature and all available evidence point to it being extremely unlikely that the major effects of PHX occur via this mechanism. In vivo PHX is {{much more likely to be}} an inhibitor of surface membrane ion channels and also to have effects on other components of cellular metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation across the cardiovascular system. However, the possibility that minor effects of PHX on CPT- 1 underpin disproportionately large effects on myocardial function cannot be entirely excluded, especially given the massive accumulation of the drug in heart tissue...|$|R
40|$|Perhexiline, 2 -(2, 2 -dicyclohexylethyl) piperidine, was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} prophylactic <b>anti-anginal</b> <b>drug</b> in the late 1960 s. It was initially a popular and effective treatment for angina, having the almost unique property compared to other agents available at that time, of not inducing reductions in blood pressure or heart rate. Despite the initial success, its use diminished markedly due to the occurrence during long-term therapy of poorly understood side effects (neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity), which later were shown {{to be associated with}} high plasma concentrations of perhexiline, occurring in patients with relatively slow hepatic metabolism of the drug. However, therapeutic plasma monitoring and associated dose adjustments have led to perhexiline's reintroduction into clinical practice. Recent clinical data have proved its safety and maintained efficacy. Perhexiline reduced anginal frequency in patients with refractory angina. In patients with chronic heart failure, perhexiline improved peak exercise oxygen consumption, left ventricular ejection fraction, symptoms, resting and peak stress myocardial function. Perhexiline also appears to be effective in suppressing symptoms in patients with acute coronary syndromes or with advanced and inoperable aortic valvular stenosis. Herein we discuss perhexiline's pharmacology with particular emphasis on its mechanism(s) of action. Yuliy Y. Chirkov, Aaron L. Sverdlov and John D. Horowitz[URL]...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPerhexiline is {{a potent}} <b>anti-anginal</b> <b>drug</b> used for {{treatment}} of refractory angina {{and other forms of}} heart disease. It provides an oxygen sparing effect in the myocardium by creating a switch from fatty acid to glucose metabolism through partial inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and 2. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effects elicited by perhexiline are not fully understood. The present study employed a combined proteomics, metabolomics and computational approach to characterise changes in murine hearts upon treatment with perhexiline. According to results based on difference in-gel electrophoresis, the most profound change in the cardiac proteome related to the activation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Metabolomic analysis by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed lower levels of total creatine and taurine in hearts of perhexiline-treated mice. Creatine and taurine levels were also significantly correlated in a cross-correlation analysis of all metabolites. Computational modelling suggested that far from inducing a simple shift from fatty acid to glucose oxidation, perhexiline may cause complex rebalancing of carbon and nucleotide phosphate fluxes, fuelled by increased lactate and amino acid uptake, to increase metabolic flexibility and to maintain cardiac output.

40|$|Aims To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} anti-ischaemic drug therapy on long-term outcomes of asymptomatic patients without coronary artery disease (CAD) history but silent exercise ST-depression. Methods and results In a randomized multicentre trial, 263 of 522 asymptomatic subjects without CAD but at least one CAD risk factor in whom silent ischaemia by exercise ECG was confirmed by stress imaging were asked to participate. The 54 (21 %) consenting patients were randomized to <b>anti-anginal</b> <b>drug</b> therapy in addition to risk factor control (MED, n = 26) or risk factor control-only (RFC, n = 28). They were followed yearly for 11. 2 ± 2. 2 years. During 483 patient-years, cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or acute coronary syndrome requiring hospitalization or revascularization occurred in 3 (12 %) of MED vs. 17 (61 %) of RFC patients (P < 0. 001). In addition, MED patients had consistently lower rates of exercise-induced ischaemia during follow-up, and left ventricular ejection fraction remained unchanged (− 0. 7 %, P = 0. 597) in contrast to RFC patients in whom it decreased over time (− 6. 0 %, P = 0. 006). Conclusion Anti-ischaemic drug therapy and aspirin seem to reduce cardiac events in subjects with asymptomatic ischaemia type I. In such patients, exercise-induced ST-segment depression should be verified by stress imaging; if silent ischaemia is documented, anti-ischaemic drug therapy and aspirin should be considere...|$|R
