40|$|The <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Ving {{construction}} occurs only 36 {{times in}} the 1, 000, 000 -word Great Britain component of the ICE corpus.

The <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> part may express intentionality (“When you go <b>to</b> Italy <b>are</b> you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing art”), expectation/probability (“And these little cartilages at the back actually move the vocal folds when they <b>'re</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> vibrating”) or something in between these two notions (“Could you just play the notes that I <b>'m</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing”). The be Ving part may encode a durative event (“You <b>'re</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transcribing all of this <b>are</b> you”; “are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> eating at your parents’ or here”), a repeated event (“And I said well I think Rebecca <b>'s</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> into her M Phil lectures”) or a punctual event (“And I <b>was</b> just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> telling people what <b>to</b> do which <b>was</b> fine”).

25|$|Specific trap {{sites for}} heavy mineral sand placer {{deposits}} are in beaches on the leeward side of headlands, as this forms a low-energy zone which traps sediments carried {{along by the}} longshore drift. Also, sand bars developed at the mouths of rivers which feed the placer deposits are rich trap sites where the winnowing action of the waves are most efficient, because heavy minerals, if they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too heavy to be moved, will deposit at an isthmus in preference to drifting too far down the beach.|$|E
25|$|The driving factor {{behind this}} {{is related to}} how many {{restrictions}} DRM imposes on a legal buyer. An ideal DRM would be one which imposes zero restrictions on legal buyers but makes imposing restrictions on infringers. Even if an ideal DRM can be created and used, in certain cases, it can be shown that removing the DRM will result in less unauthorized copying. For the ideal DRM, the reason why profits can increase {{is because of the}} demand is elastic.
