25|$|The {{cost of the}} <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> is {{estimated}} at C$6.2 billion to 8.3 billion depending on alignment and phasing. The <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> {{is included in the}} regional transportation plan The Big Move, and is one of Metrolinx's top 15 transit priorities.|$|R
50|$|Keneally's plan {{abandoned}} the rapid transit concept altogether {{in favour of}} extensions to the existing heavy rail network, starting with a so-called CBD <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> to reduce congestion at city-centre stations.

25|$|The <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> {{disappeared}} from transit plans {{soon after the}} province delayed approving Metropolitan Toronto's Network 2011 plan. The provincial government was alarmed over the construction cost and withdrew political support for the new line.

25|$|The TTC {{released}} the Network 2011 plan in 1985, and a <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> {{was one of}} the three routes proposed.

50|$|In 1912, a <b>relief</b> <b>line</b> {{was opened}} between the #2 and #3 tunnels, but the steep grade caused {{numerous}} problems including stalled trains, damaged engines and breakaways, {{and it was}} soon relegated to storage for disabled trains or portions of trains. The <b>relief</b> <b>line</b> was finally removed in 1934, thus providing room on the formation for further improvements to the alignment for the two main lines some years later.|$|R

50|$|Like the {{original}} CBD Rail Link proposal, the CBD <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> {{was intended to}} be integrated into the CityRail network. The CBD <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> was proposed to utilise the MetroWest corridor, terminate at Wynyard and link into the Western line. This differed from the CBD Rail Link which utilised the MetroPitt corridor and crossed the harbour to link into the North Shore and Chatswood to Epping lines to the north and either the Airport or Campbelltown Express lines to the south.|$|R

If so authorized, city staff could complete 15-30 per cent of the design for both projects, including schedules and better estimates, by the end of 2019.

2500|$|In March 2012, TTC CEO Andy Byford stated {{there is}} great need for {{additional}} subway capacity with the increasing population of Toronto, and capacity issues along Line 1 Yonge–University: [...] "The downtown <b>relief</b> <b>line</b> {{has got to be}} looked at and has got to be talked about right now." [...] Metrolinx officials stated that capacity issues may allow the DRL to be given higher priority in the regional transportation plan, The Big Move. Metrolinx CEO Bruce McCuaig stressed that the Downtown <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> should be prioritized and completed in 15 years, as part of Metrolinx's [...] "next wave" [...] of projects in The Big Move transit expansion plan. In February 2013, the Metrolinx Board approved changes to The Big Move that re-prioritized the eastern segment of the <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> to the 15-year plan, and made it one of the 15 top priority projects in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area.|$|R
