Despite the whole town standing up to him, he activates the sun-blocking device, thinking himself invincible. He walks into an alley, obscured from view, and struggles with someone until a gunshot is heard. He stumbles out into the open, wounded, and collapses on the town's sundial. The townspeople find him and Marge tells all of them that since Mr. Burns has angered so many people recently, just about <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been the shooter.|$|E

The party had above all (in the era prior to 1914) contributed in its prime to the political maturity of the nation and to the transformation of its society.|$|E

He had walked among piles of dead soldiers and lines of innocent people filling the roads after their homes had been destroyed. He had begun as an idealistic follower of the Wilsonian dream but, by the end, was dreadfully disillusioned with war and the colonialism that lay behind it. In the Chicago Evening Post he described what he had seen as [...] "[...] [...] a nightmare of horror: a red vision of machine guns and dead men, inspiring only a feeling of disgust for the cold efficiency with which it was accomplished." ...|$|R
25|$|Australia {{lost the}} 1972 World Cup Final to Great Britain in {{controversial}} circumstances. Australian captain Graeme Langlands was denied {{what seemed a}} fair try by being ruled offside by the French referee after catching a kick put up by halfback Dennis Ward. Television footage of the try showed Langlands was approximately a metre behind Ward when he kicked the ball. The French referee Georges Jameau's alleged reason for not awarding the try {{was that he did}} not believe <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> scored it from an onside position. The World Cup final was tied at 10–10 after full-time and was still locked after extra time. Great Britain were awarded the victory due to a higher points table placing after the pool rounds of the competition. The Final was also highlighted by an 80-metre try to Lions captain, winger Clive Sullivan.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} twentieth century, Meyerbeer's operas {{gradually}} disappeared from the stage, partly due to their length and expense to mount, partly due to their denigration by supporters of Wagnerian opera.

500|$|Sense and Sensibility has {{received}} overwhelmingly positive reviews from film critics, and was included {{on more than}} a hundred top-ten of the year lists. Writing for Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy observed that the film's success was assisted by its [...] "highly skilled cast of actors," [...] as well as its choice of Lee as director. McCarthy clarified, [...] "Although [...] previously revealed talents for dramatizing conflicting social and generational traditions will no doubt be noted, Lee's achievement here with such foreign material is simply well beyond what <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> expected and may well be posited as the cinematic equivalent of Kazuo Ishiguro writing The Remains of the Day." ...|$|E
500|$|As Wagner prospered, {{it became}} second-nature for him, his wife Cosima and the Wagner circle to deprecate Meyerbeer and his works, and Cosima's Diaries contain {{numerous}} instances of this – (as well as recording {{a dream of}} Wagner's in which he and Meyerbeer were reconciled). Wagner's autobiography 'Mein Leben', circulated amongst his friends (and published openly in 1911), contains constant sniping at Meyerbeer and concludes with Wagner receiving the news of Meyerbeer's death, and his companions' gratification at the news. The downgrading of Meyerbeer became a commonplace amongst Wagnerites: in 1898, George Bernard Shaw, in The Perfect Wagnerite, commented that [...] "Nowadays young people cannot understand how <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> taken Meyerbeer's influence seriously." ...|$|E

500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{affirmed that}} the scene {{reestablished}} The Walking Dead to full form, {{as well as}} redeemed the season's [...] "general gutlessness thus far." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall reflected similar thoughts, and observed that it was effective {{enough to keep the}} viewers chattering until the succeeding episode. Handlen summated: [...] "The Sophia reveal is a punch in the gut, because narrative fiction teaches us the longer someone stays missing, the better the chance they'll turn up alive; otherwise, where would the drama be? By using the little girl in this way, the show transforms what should've been anti-climax into a reinvention of an entire storyline. It's not enough to make the bad parts of the earlier episodes great, but it does show that the writers had more on their mind than stalling." [...] Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger felt that albeit predictable, the segment was [...] "well executed". Josh Wigler of MTV said that the storyline ended in [...] "a much darker way than <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> imagined." ...|$|E
500|$|Sports {{gambling}} expert R. J. Bell, {{president of}} sports betting information site Pregame.com, tracked every game Donaghy worked from 2003 to 2007. [...] He discovered {{that during the}} two seasons investigated by the NBA, the teams involved scored more points than expected by the Las Vegas sports books 57 percent of the time. In the previous two seasons, this only happened 44 percent of the time. According to Bell, the odds of such a discrepancy are 1 in 1,000, and there was [...] "a 99.9 percent chance that these results {{would not have happened}} without an outside factor." [...] He also found 10 straight games in 2007 in which Donaghy worked the game that the point spread moved 1.5 points or more before the tip— an indication that big money had been wagered on the game. The big money won every time—another indication that [...] "something (was) going on". [...] However, Bell suggested {{that there was no way}} anyone who wasn't in on the fix could have known that something was amiss about Donaghy's actions during a game; he said it would have been another year at the earliest before <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> caught on.|$|E
500|$|Giving {{evidence}} [...] to the tribunal, S. O. Davies said he {{had long}} suspected that the Aberfan tips were unstable, but had kept quiet for fear that if tipping was stopped on the mountainside the Coal Board would close the colliery. Davies added: [...] "But if I {{had been asked to}} do so, I would have done it". His testimony was strongly challenged by the NUM, whose counsel Brian Gibbens QC said that [...] "f Mr Davies is to be accepted as truthful and accurate in his recollection... then he bears what must be one of the largest personal burdens of responsibility for the disaster". However, Gibbens found it incredible that a man in Davies's unique local position of authority and influence would not have mentioned his fears to any of the formal bodies—borough council, Coal Board, union or local Labour Party: [...] "If <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> exercised influence to overcome an obdurate or ignorant monolith like the Coal Board, [...] was well placed to do so." [...] Gibbens submitted that Davies's testimony should be rejected, on the grounds that he [...] "never appreciated what in fact was the import of his words". The tribunal concurred, accepting that Davies had not fully understood the gravity of his admission, and adding that had they been convinced otherwise, he could not have escaped censure. The tribunal's findings, published in July 1967, placed responsibility for the disaster firmly on the National Coal Board, specifically on the absence of any tipping policy.|$|E

500|$|Post was {{released}} on 13 June 1995, as a 12" [...] record, CD, and compact cassette. It was issued on One Little Indian Records in the United Kingdom and Elektra Records in the United States and Canada; Polydor Records issued Post in Australia and Japan, also releasing the European edition of the album. Lead single [...] "Army of Me" [...] {{was released}} on 21 April 1995, shortly after the album's production concluded. It was released in the United Kingdom as two different CD releases, with [...] "Cover Me", [...] "You've Been Flirting Again", [...] "Sweet Intuition", and various remixes as its B-sides. It debuted at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming her first UK Top 10 single. Although it {{dropped out of the}} Top 20 the next week, [...] "Army of Me" [...] remained in the Top 75 for five weeks. The ending of [...] "Army of Me" [...] music video depicted Björk bombing an art museum, and due to a recent terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City, MTV removed it from its playlist before it even aired. Within weeks it was broadcast, although this [...] "foreshadowed a string of unlucky events that would further hinder Posts unveiling". An unsourced sample by Robin Rimbaud, prominently heard throughout [...] "Possibly Maybe", resulted in a lawsuit demanding a co-songwriter credit. After Rimbaud's label New Electronica refused Birkett's standard sample clearance compensation of £1,000, he and Björk resolved to destroy over 100,000 copies of the album, and [...] "remixing, remastering, and reprinting a new version". However, and at the request of Rimbaud, New Electronica later let Björk use his sample completely free of charge, meaning One Little Indian did not have to issue another version after all, since stores had yet to run out of stock of Post initial run. Björk was also due back in court as a witness in Simon Fisher's lawsuit against Nellee Hooper and herself (regarding Debuts writing credits), charges that were eventually cleared by judge Robin Jacob. Author Mark Pytlik writes: [...] "The strange combination of events had conspired to form the strangest promotional tour <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> ever envisioned: in the week since Post had been released, Björk had seen her album deleted, her video banned, and two separate lawsuits brought against her". One Little Indian were also better prepared to promote the album, scheduling a string of European and American tour dates from the beginning of July into late August.|$|E
