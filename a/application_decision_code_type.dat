40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{examining}} the degree of the basic scales (validity scales and clinical scales) between The Chinese MMPI and MMPI- 2. Four samples (include schizophrenia, affective disorder, neuroses and normal subjects) of 236 subjects completed MMPI/MMPI- 2 Combined Questionnaires in groups. The concordance rate for total <b>code</b> <b>types</b> was 90. 1 %. For 1 -point, 2 -point, 3 -point and elevated <b>code</b> <b>types,</b> they were separately 81. 6 %, 65. 8 %, 49. 2 %, 64 %. Only 56. 8 % of men compared to 73. 8 % of the women showed concordance in 2 -ponit <b>code</b> <b>types</b> between MMPI and MMPI- 2. And 58 % of normal subjects compared to 48 % of the schizophrenia subjects showed concordance in 3 -point <b>code</b> <b>types.</b> Of the 236 cases, 156 (66. 1 %) had <b>code</b> <b>types</b> that were "well-defined" (1 -, 2 - or 3 -point). 1 -point, 2 -point, 3 -point well-defined <b>code</b> <b>types</b> respectively were 38. 6 %, 29. 7 %, 21. 6 %. For 2 -point <b>code</b> <b>types</b> which were well-defined, the concordances was 84. 3 %, 82. 8 %, 85. 7 % (all the cases, men, women), higher than 64. 4 %, 56. 8 %, 72. 9 % when they were free-defined. 96. 4 % of subjects with incongruent 2 -point <b>code</b> <b>types</b> {{had one of the}} scales in their MMPI <b>code</b> <b>types</b> with MMPI- 2 <b>code</b> <b>types.</b> When deference caused by the use of uniform T-scores and new norms in MMPI- 2 were found, the differences typically in <b>code</b> <b>types</b> congruence were not very great. Comparison of mean scores for the validity and clinical scales, 7 raw scores and 12 T-scores showed significant difference for MMPI versus MMPI- 2 (Form). In spite of significant mean differences, correlational analyses show correlations above 0. 92 for the raw scores and T-scores for each gender. All these results showed the good consistence between MMPI and MMPI- 2 in basic scales, and showed MMPI- 2 should be studied deeply. 本研究目的在于考察中文MMPI和MMPI－ 2 对应基础量表（效度量表和临床量表）之间的延续性程度。实验中采用MMPI/MMPI－ 2 复合问卷，对 4 种被试（精神分裂症、情感性精神障碍患者、神经症及正常人）共 236 名被试进行施测。结果表明，两者编码类型总体符合率达 90. 1 %，单点、两点、三点编码符合率分别为 81. 6 %， 65. 8 %， 49. 2 %，高分编码符合率为 64 %。男性被试两点编码符合率 56. 8 %低于女性被试的 72. 9 %。正常被试三点编码符合率 58 %高于精神分裂症被试 48 ％的符合率。 236 名被试中，有 156 名（ 66. 1 %）被试的剖析图符合限制性定义，符合限制性定义的单点、两点、三点编码分别为 38. 6 %， 29. 7 %， 21. 6 %。给以限制性定义后，两点编码符合率由 64. 4 %， 56. 8 %， 72. 9 %（被试全体，男性，女性）分别提高到 84. 3 %， 82. 8 %， 85. 7 %。不相符合的两点编码类型中， 96. 4 %的MMPI剖析图和MMPI－ 2 具有同样一个编码量表。一致性T分和新常模标准在MMPI－ 2 中的采用对符合率的影响都未达到显著水平。方差分析提示，MMPI和MMPI－ 2 的原始分 13 个量表中有 7 个量表存在显著差异，标准T分有 12 个量表存在显著性差异，尽管量表间有较大差异，但对应临床量表和效度量表的相关系数，无论男女被试，均在 0. 92 以上。综上所述，可以看出：中文MMPI和MMPI－ 2 在临床量表和效度量表上具有较高程度的延续性，同时提示对于MMPI－ 2 需要进一步的深入研究...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} novel {{techniques for}} source controlled variable rate wideband speech coding. These techniques {{have been used}} in the variable-rate multimode wideband (VMR-WB) speech codec recently selected by 3 GPP 2 for wideband (WB) speech telephony, streaming, and multimedia messaging services in the cdma 2000 third generation wireless system. The coding algorithm contains several innovations that enable very good performance at average bit rates as low as 4. 0 kbit/s in typical conversational operating conditions. These innovations include: Efficient noise suppression algorithm, signal classification and rate selection algorithm that enables high quality operation at low average bit rates, efficient post-processing techniques tailored for wideband signals, and novel frame erasure concealment techniques including supplementary information for reconstruction of lost onsets and improving decoder convergence. Further, the coder utilizes efficient <b>coding</b> <b>types</b> optimized for different classes of speech signal including a generic <b>coding</b> <b>type</b> based on AMR-WB for transients and onsets, voiced <b>coding</b> <b>type</b> optimized for stable voiced signals and utilizing novel signal modification procedure resulting in good wideband quality at 6. 2 kbit/s, unvoiced <b>coding</b> <b>types</b> optimized for unvoiced segments, and efficient comfort noise generation coding.

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the performance of}} three abbreviated MMPIs, the Mini-Mult, the FAM, and the MMPI- 168 {{as well as the}} MMPI, in their ability to predict diagnosis, in their ability to emulate the MMPI, and in their utility with the Gilberstadt and Duker prototype system. Most of the previous research had used the one, two or three highest profile scale matches from the short to long forms to assess <b>code</b> <b>type</b> compatibility instead of an actual typing system. Further, most of the prior studies had used traditional maximum likelihood statistical measures to assess performance. Posterior probabilities calculated from Bayes' rule were used as the primary measure here. Both the original norms and new prediction equations calculated from the sample data for the three short forms were used for all three tests, with a sample size of 578 male veteran inpatients for the Mini-Mult and FAM, and a sample size of 358 for the MMPI- 168. The new equations generally outperformed the original ones by most measures, but the trends were similar in both conditions. There was little <b>code</b> <b>type</b> agreement between the short forms and the full MMPI, even though they usually had high scale-to-scale correlations and similar scale means. Part of the reason for this was the low rate of typing on any test, around 30 %. Another reason was the low rate of high point correspondence between the short and full forms. A normal code with all clinical scales {{less than or equal to}} 70 T-scores performed best, although it is not part of the prototype system. All of the short forms had high valid and false negative rates for the <b>code</b> <b>types</b> with respect to the MMPI's <b>code</b> <b>types.</b> Diagnoses, as set by clinicians and recorded from each case's psychology service file, formed the external performance criteria. Across tests, few <b>code</b> <b>types</b> tended to be associated with a particular diagnosis and diagnoses weren't basically associated with <b>code</b> <b>types.</b> Trying to match diagnoses predicted by the <b>code</b> <b>types</b> with file diagnoses yielded only about a. 10 overall probability of a match across tests, including the MMPI, under the most strict conditions. Liberalizing the conditions could bump the hit rates to about. 70. The MMPI- 168 with new equations was the best short form and outperformed the full MMPI in some conditions. Limitations of this study, some possible implications, and future research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|How do rankings affect demand? This paper {{investigates the}} impact of college rankings, and the {{visibility}} of those rankings, on students' <b>application</b> <b>decisions.</b> Using natural experiments from U. S. News and World Report College Rankings, we present two main findings. First, we identify a causal impact of rankings on <b>application</b> <b>decisions.</b> When explicit rankings of colleges are published in U. S. News, a one-rank improvement leads to a 1 -percentage-point {{increase in the number}} of applications to that college. Second, we show that the response to the information represented in rankings depends on the way in which that information is presented. Rankings have no effect on <b>application</b> <b>decisions</b> when colleges are listed alphabetically, even when readers are provided data on college quality and the methodology used to calculate rankings. This finding provides evidence that the salience of information is a central determinant of a firm's demand function, even for purchases as large as college attendance. ...|$|R

40|$|List-based {{algorithms}} for decoding Block Turbo Codes (BTC) {{have gained}} popularity {{due to their}} low computational complexity. The normal way to calculate the soft outputs involves searching for a <b>decision</b> <b>code</b> word D and a competing codeword B.

Soft outputs are generated based on the Euclidean distance property of <b>decision</b> <b>code</b> words. More importantly, such algorithm has very low computational complexity and is very attractive for practical applications. Based on the synthesis result of FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) implementations of the new algorithm, significant complexity saving (up to 79 %) is achieved compared to commercially available products. In terms of error performance, we observe certain improvement (0. 3 dB coding gain) for BTCs of large Hamming distance and negligible performance degradation for BTCs of short Hamming distance...|$|R
