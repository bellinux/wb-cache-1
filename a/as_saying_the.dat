25|$|Several {{theories}} {{have emerged as}} to the motives for the hijacking. At first Turkish media reported police sources <b>as</b> <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> hijacking was in protest at the envisaged visit of Pope Benedict XVI, who has offended many Muslims with a recent speech linking {{the spread of the}} Islamic faith to violence. But later it was reported that the hijacker sought political asylum in Italy due to his conscientious objection to serving in the military.|$|E

Chatayev served nine months in a Swedish prison in 2008 after being convicted of smuggling weapons into Sweden. Two of the three attackers were identified as Rakim Bulgarov and Vadim Osmanov, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency.|$|E
25|$|One {{issue that}} sparked {{tensions}} between France and Canada began {{shortly after the}} creation of la Francophonie, an international organization of wholly and partially French-speaking countries modeled somewhat after the Commonwealth of Nations. While Canada agreed in principle to the organization's creation, it was dismayed by France's position that not only should Quebec participate as an equal, independent member, but {{that the federal government}} and (by omission) the other provinces with significant French minorities could not. This was seen by many French-Canadians outside of Quebec as a betrayal. This was also seen by some Canadians as France supporting the Quebec sovereignty movement. Some go as far <b>as</b> <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> Francophonie was created to help push the international recognition of Quebec, but in reality the Francophonie was created to promote international cooperation between all French speaking nations, including many newly independent former French colonies in Africa.|$|E

500|$|Rose {{writes that}} there was a racist media frenzy after the killing, placing intense {{external}} pressure on detectives to solve the case. According to Rose, the news coverage included The Sun newspaper comparing Labour's prospective candidate for Tottenham, Bernie Grant– who had emigrated from Guyana in 1963– to an ape, writing that he had given a press conference while peeling a banana and juggling an orange. Grant had caused uproar when he was reported <b>as</b> <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> police had been given a [...] "bloody good hiding," [...] although his statement was also reported as: [...] "The youths around here believe the police were to blame for what happened on Sunday and what they got was a bloody good hiding." ...|$|E

500|$|The game's {{graphics}} {{were generally}} praised by critics. GameSpot's Andrew Park stated that virtually {{everything in the}} PC version [...] "looks bright, colorful and clean" [...] when playing in 3D-accelerated mode, but called its texturing minimal. GameSpot's Ben Stahl also called the N64 version's track design [...] "innovative and cute", as well <b>as</b> <b>saying</b> <b>the</b> tracks and backgrounds have a [...] "somewhat real look" [...] {{that makes it easier}} to tell where the player should be driving. IGN's reviewer for the PC version praised the game's background animations, stating that they not only [...] "add to the atmosphere of the game, but also affect the way it plays". However, some reviewers criticised the game's performance, with IGN's Sam Bishop stating that the PlayStation version's load times between levels are horrendous and Next Generation Chris Charla calling the N64 version's framerate [...] "nauseatingly slow". Conversely, IGN's Winnie Imperio called the N64 version's framerate [...] "consistent, if not entirely smooth".|$|E
