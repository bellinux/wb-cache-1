At his desk, Dr. Horace Wilkinson could see the never-ending double current of people which ebbed and flowed in front of his window. It was a busy street, and the air was forever filled with the dull roar of life, the grinding of the wheels, and the patter of countless feet. Men, women, and children, thousands and thousands of them passed in the day, and yet each was hurrying on upon his own business, scarce glancing at the small brass plate, or wasting a thought upon the man who waited in the front room. And yet how many of them would obviously, glaringly have been the better for his professional assistance. Dyspeptic men, anemic women, blotched faces, bilious complexions--they flowed past him, they needing him, he needing them, and yet the remorseless bar of professional etiquette kept them forever apart. What could he do? Could he stand at his own front door, pluck the casual stranger by the sleeve, and whisper in his ear, [...] "Sir, you will forgive me for remarking that you are suffering from a severe attack of <b>acne</b> <b>rosacea,</b> which makes you a peculiarly unpleasant object. Allow me to suggest that a small prescription containing arsenic, which will not cost you more than you often spend upon a single meal, will be very much to your advantage."

40|$|Diet {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the role of diet in the development of common skin conditions such as <b>acne</b> and <b>rosacea.</b> The association of diet and acne has been controversial and unclear. Historically, it was thought that diet did not cause acne; however, recent studies reveal a potential role of diet in the pathogenesis of acne. Individuals that have a diet with a high glycemic load or increased milk consumption are reported to have a greater likelihood of having acne. This effect may be mediated by insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) since IGF- 1 levels increase with milk consumption and with a high glycemic load and are known to contribute to the formation of acne. In contrast to acne, the association of diet and rosacea is much more accepted and established. There are a variety of foods that aggravate rosacea, including spicy foods, alcoholic beverages, and hot, caffeinated drinks. Patients are advised to avoid these triggers. Interestingly, omega- 3 and omega- 6 fatty acids may be beneficial in the treatment of rosacea, although further investigation is necessary.
