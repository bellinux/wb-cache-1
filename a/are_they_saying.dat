[...] According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak was struck dumb. [...] "He was totally unprepared for such a conversation. But then he heard his voice, the voice of Stalin, coming over the line. The Leader addressed him in a rather bluff uncouth fashion, using the familiar thou form: 'Tell me, what <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>saying</b> in your literary circles about the arrest of Mandelstam?'" [...] Flustered, Pasternak denied {{that there was any}} discussion or that there were any literary circles left in Soviet Russia. Stalin went on to ask him for his own opinion of Mandelstam. In an [...] "eager fumbling manner" [...] Pasternak explained that he and Mandelstam each had a completely different philosophy about poetry. Stalin finally said, in a mocking tone of voice: [...] "I see, you just aren't able to stick up for a comrade," [...] and put down the receiver.|$|E

'I obey,' said Rupert, with a funny face of submission, {{and taking}} up his paper and pencil; {{but in a}} minute or two he started up, exclaiming, 'What <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>saying</b> about Oxford?' and walked into the next room, {{intending}} {{to take part in the}} conversation between his father and uncle. Mr. Woodbourne, however, who was no great admirer of Rupert's forwardness, did not shew so much deference to his nephew's opinion as to make him very unwilling to return to the inner drawing-room, when Anne came to tell him that all the poems were finished, and Elizabeth ready to read them aloud.|$|E

5000|$|It Won't Snow Where You're Going is {{the third}} {{full-length}} album by Illinois indie rock band Park. It was released in 2003 on Lobster Records. Although the album contained some dark references to suicide, the liner notes contained links for the International Suicide Prevention Program, and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, among others. The band addressed their choice of subject matter with the following statement within their CD liner notes:"This album is purely an artistic interpretation of personal experiences. Although there are some references in certain songs suggesting suicide, by no means <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>saying</b> that suicide should be an option during a sad or upsetting time in life. If you or someone you know is ever {{in a situation where}} you feel suicidal, there is always someone to talk to; friends, family, or counselors." ...|$|E
