5|$|Historically, Egyptian breeders {{imported}} horses bred in {{the deserts}} of Palestine and the Arabian peninsula {{as the source of}} their foundation bloodstock. By the time that the Ottoman Empire dominated Egypt, the political elites of the region still recognized the need for quality bloodstock for both war and for horse racing, and some continued to return to the deserts to obtain pure-blooded Arabians. One of the most famous was Muhammad Ali of Egypt, also known as Muhammad Ali Pasha, who established an extensive stud farm in the 19th century. After his death, some of his stock was bred on by Abbas I of Egypt, also known as Abbas Pasha. However, after Abbas Pasha was assassinated in 1854, his heir, El Hami Pasha, sold most of his horses, often for crossbreeding, and gave away many others as diplomatic gifts. A remnant of the herd was obtained by Ali Pasha Sherif, who then went back to the desert to bring in new bloodstock. At its peak, the stud of Ali Pasha Sherif had over 400 purebred Arabians. Unfortunately, an epidemic of <b>African</b> <b>horse</b> <b>sickness</b> in the 1870s that killed thousands of horses throughout Egypt decimated much of his herd, wiping out several irreplaceable bloodlines. Late in his life, he sold several horses to Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt, who exported them to Crabbet Park Stud in England. After his death, Lady Anne was also able to gather many remaining horses at her Sheykh Obeyd stud.|$|E
25|$|<b>African</b> <b>horse</b> <b>sickness</b> {{is related}} to Bluetongue and is spread by the same midges (Culicoides species). It can kill the horses it infects and {{mortality}} may {{go as high as}} 90% of the infected horses during an epidemic.|$|E
25|$|Severe biting {{stress to}} cattle, sheep and horses is caused. Horses {{suffer from a}} {{cutaneous}} hypersensitivity reaction called sweet-itch, or Queensland-itch that is caused by antigenic components of saliva of biting midges. Poultry may be severely afflicted with biting stress. Species such as Culicoides imicola and Culicoides variipennis transmit bluetongue virus between sheep and cattle (see diagram and photograph above), and they transmit <b>African</b> <b>horse</b> <b>sickness</b> virus between horses and other equids. Culicoides midges transmit Leucocytozoon protozoa to poultry birds.|$|E

50|$|Peruvian <b>horse</b> <b>sickness</b> was {{described}} in 1997 when an unexpected number of deaths in horses occurred {{during the rainy season}} in Peru. The cause of death in most affected horses was complications due to encephalitis. One of the viruses collected from horses that died of the disease was named Peruvian <b>horse</b> <b>sickness</b> virus (PHSV). The 1997 outbreak was considered an epizootic outbreak that involved a variety of domestic animals including horses, cattle, donkeys, and sheep. PHSV was also isolated from horses showing similar clinical signs in 1999 in the Northern Territory of Australia, though the Australian isolate was called Elsey virus until it was determined to likely be the same species as PHSV.|$|R
500|$|Brumby populations {{also may}} have the {{potential}} to pass exotic diseases, such as equine influenza and <b>African</b> <b>horse</b> <b>sickness</b> to domestic horses. [...] They also may carry tick fever, which can be passed to both horses and cattle. This can lead to high fatalities among domestic populations, causing many farmers to call for the management of feral horses.|$|E
500|$|Horses {{were used}} for warfare in the central Sudan since the 9th century, where they were {{considered}} [...] "the most precious commodity following the slave." [...] The first conclusive evidence of horses playing {{a major role in}} the warfare of West Africa dates to the 11th century when the region was controlled by the Almoravids, a Muslim Berber dynasty. During the 13th and 14th centuries, cavalry became an important factor in the area. This coincided with the introduction of larger breeds of horse and the widespread adoption of saddles and stirrups. Increased mobility played a part in the formation of new power centers, such as the Oyo Empire in what today is Nigeria. The authority of many African Islamic states such as the Bornu Empire also rested in large part on their ability to subject neighboring peoples with cavalry. Despite harsh climate conditions, endemic diseases such as trypanosomiasis the <b>African</b> <b>horse</b> <b>sickness</b> and unsuitable terrain that limited the effectiveness of horses in many parts of Africa, horses were continuously imported and were, in some areas, a vital instrument of war. The introduction of horses also intensified existing conflicts, such as those between the Herero and Nama people in Namibia during the 19th century.|$|E
