By 1955, Confidential had reached five million copies per issue with a larger circulation than Reader's Digest, Ladies' Home Journal, Look, The Saturday Evening Post or Collier's. That year Harrison shut down all his men's magazines except Beauty Parade <b>and</b> <b>Whisper.</b> Beauty Parade would cease the next year <b>and</b> <b>Whisper</b> would continue as Confidentials sister publication, which recycled variants of Confidentials stories.|$|E

25|$|Harrison's {{publicity}} stunt backfired. The deal with Brown became the effective end of Confidential <b>and</b> <b>Whisper,</b> as the magazines {{were no longer}} able to publish their usual scandalous stories. The magazines' one and only trial cost Harrison over $500,000—in addition to legal fees of $500,000 and a $5,000 fine for each magazine, Maureen O'Hara settled out-of-court for an undisclosed sum on July 1, 1958; Errol Flynn settled on July 8, 1958 for $15,000; and on July 16, 1958, Liberace settled for $40,000, an amount that the pianist might typically exceed with one or two performances. In addition the legal fees and settlements, Harrison gave the Meades $150,000 as a gift. Harrison was still a multimillionaire.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of postal Boca Raton lies {{outside of the}} actual city limits. This large unincorporated area {{to the west of}} the city limits is included in the Boca Raton mailing address and local telephone calling area. There are many large planned developments in the area, including gated communities, and a number of golf courses. This is a result in the later start of development in these areas, and the availability of large tracts of land. Many of these communities are large enough to be designated as census-designated places, including Boca Del Mar and Boca Pointe, geographically in Central Boca Raton, with Avalon at Boca Raton, Boca Falls, Boca Winds, Cimarron, Hamptons at Boca Raton, Mission Bay, Loggers' Run, The Polo Club Boca Raton and polo club movers, Sandalfoot Cove, <b>and</b> <b>Whisper</b> Walk as West Boca Raton.|$|E
25|$|Vocal {{imitation}} occurs potentially {{in regard}} to a diverse range of phonetic units and types of vocalization. The world's languages use consonantal phones that differ in thirteen imitable vocal tract place of articulations (from the lips to the glottis). These phones can potentially be pronounced with eleven types of imitable manner of articulations (nasal stops to lateral clicks). Speech can be copied {{in regard to}} its social accent, intonation, pitch and individuality (as with entertainment impersonators). Speech can be articulated in ways which diverge considerably in speed, timbre, pitch, loudness and emotion. Speech further exists in different forms such as song, verse, scream <b>and</b> <b>whisper.</b> Intelligible speech can be produced with pragmatic intonation and in regional dialects and foreign accents. These aspects are readily copied: people asked to repeat speech-like words imitate not only phones but also accurately other pronunciation aspects such as fundamental frequency, schwa-syllable expression, voice spectra and lip kinematics, voice onset times, and regional accent.|$|E

500|$|The {{continuing}} student {{protests against}} the war brought Agnew's scorn. In a speech on April 28 in Hollywood, Florida, Agnew stated that responsibility of the unrest lay with those who failed to guide them, and suggested that the alumni of Yale University fire its president, Kingman Brewster. The Cambodia incursion brought more demonstrations on campus, and on May 3, Agnew went on Face the Nation to defend the policy. Reminded that Nixon, in his inaugural address, had called for the lowering of voices in political discourse, Agnew commented, [...] "When a fire takes place, a man doesn't run into the room <b>and</b> <b>whisper...</b> he yells, 'Fire!' and I am yelling 'Fire!' because I think 'Fire!' needs to be called here". The Kent State shootings took place the following day, but Agnew did not tone down his attacks on demonstrators, alleging that he was responding to [...] "a general malaise that argues for violent confrontation instead of debate". Nixon had Haldeman tell Agnew to avoid remarks about students; Agnew strongly disagreed and stated that he would only refrain if Nixon directly ordered it.|$|E
500|$|He {{returned}} to writing scripts for British television, including Gentry with Roger Daltrey for ITV in 1987, and the 1989 adaptation of Susan Hill's novel The Woman in Black for transmission on ITV on Christmas Eve. Lynne Truss, reviewing a repeat {{broadcast of the}} production on Channel 4 for The Times in 1994, wrote that: [...] "Clip-clop is not usually a noise to get upset about. But {{it will be an}} interesting test, today, to go up behind people <b>and</b> <b>whisper</b> 'clip-clop', to find out whether they saw The Woman in Black last night. People who made the bold decision to watch this excellent drama will respond to any 'clip-clop' by gratifyingly leaping in the air and grabbing the backs of their necks." [...] The adaptation nearly went unmade; Kneale had written the script in ten days but been advised by his agent to wait before submitting it to the producers Central Independent Television so that they would not think he had rushed it. When he did submit the script three weeks later, he discovered that Central had been about to cancel the production as they had assumed that Kneale, then 67, {{had not been able to}} complete the work due to his age.|$|E

500|$|... "Black & Blue" [...] {{received}} {{a positive response}} from music critics. John Bergstrom of PopMatters described it as [...] "smooth, winning blue-eyed soul", and Neil Ashman of Drowned in Sound commented that its breathy vocals, piano chords and synth backing made it a [...] "successful blend of melancholy and dancefloor-ready rhythms". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian deemed the falsetto vocals and synths [...] "naggingly infectious", citing it as the band's strong point: [...] "the trio may be faceless, but they write a good tune". Sputnikmusic's staff reviewer Rudy Klapper felt that the [...] "techno swirl" [...] of the song [...] "nail the juxtaposition between Wyatt's moody lyrics and the irrepressible production". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music rated [...] "Black & Blue" [...] four stars out of five and recommended it for when [...] "you just need something to lift the spirits a bit, without someone shouting something stupid in your ear". He continued, [...] "It basically wants to rub your shoulders {{at the end of}} a long hard day, <b>and</b> <b>whisper</b> something funny in your ear while your shoulders untie." [...] Natalie Kaye of Contactmusic.com said that although it begins melancholy, it [...] "swells to become one of the noisiest points on Miike Snow". Paul Mitchell of The Skinny felt that Wyatt channels Paddy McAloon's breathy vocal style on [...] "Black & Blue", but without the [...] "lyrical wit". He rated the song three stars out of five and called it [...] "decent", finding the remixes available on the release more interesting. A more critical review came from Pitchfork Media's Marc Hogan, who wrote that it [...] "promisingly... splits the difference between Prince and piano-pop, only to underwhelm as a whole".|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Bother" [...] {{was directed by}} Jaume de Laiguana, who had previously collaborated with Shakira on the video for [...] "No", and was released on 15 November 2005. The video begins with a man parking his sports {{car in front of}} a house and proceeding to enter it. Shakira is seen lying on a bed {{in the house and the}} man comes up and lies beside her, indicating that they are a couple. As soon as the man falls asleep, Shakira wakes up and lies atop the man and begins to caress him and bite <b>and</b> <b>whisper</b> in his ear a few times, although he does not wake up. Shakira takes the keys of the man's car and drives it to a wrecking yard. The video then interludes to scenes of Shakira sexually romancing the man in a shower. The scene then changes back to the wrecking yard, where Shakira begins playing a pink guitar. After the spoken bridge of the song, Shakira places her partner's car in a car crusher, which soon commences demolishing it. The man reacts in a similar manner to the car being crushed and begins experiencing continuous body jerks and spasms, indicating a connection between his car and his body. After the car is fully destroyed, Shakira leaves the man unconscious on the bed, exits the house, and begins walking on the street triumphantly. Shakira explained the usage of the car symbolism in the video, saying that [...] "A man's car is like an extension of their ego and their manhood. I thought this would be a video that would make women say, 'Yeah, yeah!' and it would make men feel".|$|E

A radio spot, referred to by critics as the [...] "jungle drums" [...] ad, had drums playing when Ford's name was mentioned and patriotic music when Corker's name was spoken. This ad was criticized as attacking Ford's race by evoking images of primitive, chanting African tribes. A television ad that received more attention featured satirical [...] "man‑on‑the‑street" [...] interviews purporting to support Ford, including one in which a blond white woman talks about meeting Ford at [...] "the Playboy party"; she returns {{at the end of}} the ad to wink <b>and</b> <b>whisper</b> in a seductive tone, [...] "Harold, call me." [...] The ad was denounced by many people, including Republican former Senator William Cohen, who called it [...] "a very serious appeal to a racist sentiment", and Corker asked the Republican leadership to pull the ad.

2500|$|He {{is perhaps}} underestimated as a {{musician}} and blues guitarist. His guitar work, for which he credits Tom Paley as fingerpicking teacher, is noteworthy for both syncopation and precision. It shows similarities to Mississippi John Hurt's, but Van Ronk's main influence was the Reverend Gary Davis, who conceived the guitar as [...] "a piano around his neck". Van Ronk took this pianistic approach and added a harmonic sophistication adapted from the band voicings of Jelly Roll Morton and Duke Ellington. He ranks high in bringing blues style to Greenwich Village during the 1960s, as well as introducing the folk world to the complex harmonies of Kurt Weill in his many Brecht-Weill interpretations, and {{being one of the}} very few hardcore traditional revivalists to move with the times, bringing old blues and ballads together with the new sounds of Dylan, Mitchell and Leonard Cohen. During this crucial period, he performed with the likes of Bob Dylan and spent many years teaching guitar in Greenwich Village, including to Christine Lavin, David Massengill, Terre Roche and Suzzy Roche. He influenced his protégé Danny Kalb and The Blues Project. The Japanese singer Masato Tomobe, American pop-folk singer Geoff Thais and the musician and writer Elijah Wald learned from him as well. Known for making interesting and memorable observations he once said, [...] "Painting is all about space, and music is all about time." [...] In his autobiography Bob Dylan states, [...] "I'd heard Van Ronk back in the Midwest on records and thought he was pretty great, copied some of his recordings phrase for phrase. [...] Van Ronk could howl <b>and</b> <b>whisper,</b> turn blues into ballads and ballads into blues. I loved his style. He was what the city was all about. In Greenwich Village, Van Ronk was king of the street, he reigned supreme." ...|$|E
