The industry was noted by Richard Pococke, who visited Bethlehem in 1727.|$|E
5|$|Patrolling by the Australians {{continued}} {{in order to}} prevent the Chinese from harassing their forward positions. Small clashes occurred on the nights of 15/16, 21/22, 22/23 and 23/24 July, suggesting that the Chinese were preparing for a major attack. Aerial reconnaissance subsequently detected a build up of Chinese forces and supplies west of the Samichon River. In response the Australians and US Marines stepped up their defensive preparations, {{while at the same time}} rumours from the peace talks started to spread of a ceasefire. Regardless, Chinese harassing artillery and mortar fire intensified, causing <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> of casualties among the Australians. Intense Chinese shelling struck Hill 121 and The Hook on the night of 19/20 July, with more than 300 rounds wounding four members of C Company, 2 RAR and further damaging the defences. That night the US Marines were driven off the Berlin and East Berlin features on the left flank, further exposing The Hook, which became a salient. Yet on 21 July an expected Chinese assault in the US 5th Marine Regiment sector failed to occur, while sightings of Chinese troops across the US 1st Marine Division front declined as the fighting entered a lull.|$|E

25|$|The widespread, {{frequent}} use of acronyms across {{the whole range of}} registers is a relatively new linguistic phenomenon in most languages, becoming increasingly evident since the mid-20th century.

The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) records the first printed use of the word initialism as occurring in 1899, but it did not come into general use until 1965, well after acronym had become common.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{kinematics}} of a weak shock front {{governed by a}} hyperbolic system of conservation laws is studied. This is used to develop a method for solving problems, involving the propagation of nonlinear unimodal waves. It consists of first solving the nonlinear wave problem by moving along the bicharacteristics {{of the system and}} then fitting the shock into this solution field, so that it satisfies the necessary jump conditions. The kinematics of the shock leads in a natural way to the definition of ldquoshock-raysrdquo, which play the same role as the ldquoraysrdquo in a continuous flow. A special case of a circular cylinder introduced suddenly in <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>streaming</b> flow is studied in detail. The shock fitted in the upstream region propagates with a velocity which is the mean of the velocities of the linear and the nonlinear wave fronts. In the downstream the solution is given by an expansion wave...|$|R

For a long time, {{the vast majority of}} the mail received was from the top few fanatical SFB players, who constantly campaigned for new rules, rules fixes, and rules changes. This became a source of discontent for most of the rest of the players, who did not appreciate a game that changed every few months, and needed a sheaf of notes along with the voluminous rules. However, it was generally believed nearly impossible to repair the damage by properly re-writing and re-integrating such a large and complex system into a new edition before doomsday, especially without bringing the product line to a halt while only new versions of old products were released.|$|E
25|$|Grant faced two Confederate armies in his campaign: the Vicksburg garrison, {{commanded}} by Maj. Gen. John C. Pemberton, and forces in Jackson, {{commanded by}} Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, the overall theater commander. Rather than simply heading directly {{north to the}} city, Grant chose to cut the line of communications (and reinforcement) between the two Confederate armies. His army headed swiftly northeast toward Jackson. Meanwhile, Grant brought with him a limited supply line. The conventional history of the campaign indicates that he cut loose from all of his supplies, perplexing Pemberton, who attempted to interdict his nonexistent lines at Raymond on May 12. In reality, Grant relied on the local economy to provide him only foodstuffs for men and animals, but there was <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> of wagons carrying ammunition, coffee, hardtack, salt, and other supplies for his army.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of her medieval cult was {{spurred by the}} reported rediscovery of her body around the year 800 at Mount Sinai, with hair still growing and <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> of healing oil issuing from her body. There are several pilgrimage narratives that chronicle the journey to Mount Sinai, most notably those of John Mandeville and Friar Felix Fabri. However, the monastery at Mount Sinai was the best-known site of Catherine pilgrimage, but was also {{the most difficult to}} reach. The most prominent Western shrine was the monastery in Rouen that claimed to house Catherine's fingers. It was not alone in the west, however, accompanied by many, scattered shrines and altars dedicated to Catherine, which existed throughout France and England. Some were better known sites, such as Canterbury and Westminster, which claimed a phial of her oil, brought back from Mount Sinai by Edward the Confessor. Other shrines, such as St. Catherine's Hill, Hampshire were the focus of generally local pilgrimage, many of which are only identified by brief mentions in various texts, rather than by physical evidence.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{extensive}} restrictions, limitations, and hardships, Decembrists {{believed that}} they could improve their situation through personal initiative. <b>A</b> <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> of petitions came out of Petrovsky Zavod addressed to General Leparskii and Emperor Nicholas I. Most of the petitions were written by Decembrists’ wives who had nobly cast aside social privileges and comfort to follow their husbands into exile. These wives joined {{under the leadership of}} Princess Mariia Volkonskaia, and by 1832, through relentless petitions, managed to secure for their men formal cancellation of labor requirements, and several privileges, including the right of husbands to live with their wives in privacy. Decembrists managed to gain transfers and allowances through persuasive petitions as well as through the intervention of family members. This process of petitioning, and the resultant concessions made by the tsar and officials, was and would continue to be a standard practice of political exiles in Siberia. The chain of bureaucratic procedures and orders linking St. Petersburg to Siberian administration was often circumvented or ignored. These breaks in bureaucracy afforded exiles a small capacity for betterment and activism.|$|E
25|$|Cleanrooms {{maintain}} particulate-free {{air through}} the use of either HEPA or ULPA filters employing laminar or turbulent air flow principles. Laminar, or unidirectional, air flow systems direct filtered air downward or in horizontal direction in <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised perforated floor panels to be recirculated. Laminar air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct laminar air flow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or non unidirectional, air flow uses both laminar air flow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion, although not all in the same direction. The rough air seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor, where they enter filters and leave the cleanroom environment. US FDA and EU have laid down guidelines and limit for microbial contamination which is very stringent to ensure freedom from microbial contamination in pharmaceutical products.|$|E
