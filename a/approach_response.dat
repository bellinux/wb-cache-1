50|$|Barry Singer {{presented}} {{a model of}} the process of sexual arousal in 1984, in which he conceptualized human sexual response to be composed of three independent but generally sequential components. The first stage, aesthetic response, is an emotional reaction to noticing an attractive face or figure. This emotional reaction produces an increase in attention toward the object of attraction, typically involving head and eye movements toward the attractive object. The second stage, <b>approach</b> <b>response,</b> progresses from the first and involves bodily movements towards the object. The final genital response stage recognizes that with both attention and closer proximity, physical reactions result in genital tumescence. Singer also stated that there is an array of other autonomic responses, but acknowledges that the research literature suggests that the genital response is the most reliable and convenient to measure in males.|$|E
50|$|The {{alternative}} <b>approach,</b> <b>response</b> to intervention, identifies {{children who}} are having difficulties in school in their first or second year after starting school. They then receive additional assistance such as participating in a reading remediation program. The response of the children to this intervention then determines whether they are designated as having a learning disability. Those few who still have trouble may then receive designation and further assistance. Sternberg (1999) has argued that early remediation can greatly {{reduce the number of}} children meeting diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities. He has also suggested that the focus on learning disabilities and the provision of accommodations in school fails to acknowledge that people have a range of strengths and weaknesses and places undue emphasis on academics by insisting that students should be supported in this arena and not in music or sports.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{purposes}} of this study were to investigate consumers' responses (aesthetic response, <b>approach</b> <b>response,</b> and perceived risk) to two types of visual merchandise displays (full size mannequin and flat hanging display) in an in-store retail setting. An interest for this study arises from retailers' constant effort to differentiate themselves from other retailers and increase retention through in-store entertainment or "shopper-tainment". Kotler (1973 / 74, p. 50) defined atmospherics as "the conscious designing of space to create specific effects in buyers to enhance purchase likelihood". An aspect of effective atmospherics is known as visual merchandising – "how merchandise is visually communicated to the customer" by the retailer (Kerfoot et al., 2003, p. 143). Many retailers have specific visual merchandisers who strive to create the most attractive and beneficial type of window and in-store displays to attract customers and give information about products. In-store displays also provide customers with a mental image of how merchandise can be used or combined. A model, based on the S-O-R model (introduced by Mehrabian and Russell in 1974), was proposed that a stimulus, in this case display type (flat hanging display, full size mannequin) can influence a behavioral response in a consumer, in this case <b>approach</b> <b>response</b> and perceived risk, which is mediated by that consumer's affective or cognitive response, which in this is case is aesthetic response. An additional component added to the traditional S-O-R model was shopping value as a moderator. Shopping value refers to a customer's orientation or goal while shopping, measured by hedonic score. To test the proposed model, a convenience sample of 76 males and 76 females was employed. The independent variable for this study was display type (full size mannequin or flat hanging display) for each gender, which was performed twice due to stimulus sampling procedure. The moderator was shopping value; the dependent variables were aesthetic response, <b>approach</b> <b>response</b> and perceived risk. Cronbach's alpha was used to test internal consistency of each measure. An ANOVA was used to compare participants' responses between the two experimental days; i. e., test to see if the styles of clothing in the displays affected the responses. A MANOVA analysis was used to examine relationships between the independent variable (display type) and dependent variables (aesthetic response, <b>approach</b> <b>response</b> and perceived risk). A second MANOVA was run to test the moderating relationship of shopping value (hedonic) on dependent variables (aesthetic response, <b>approach</b> <b>response,</b> perceived risk) caused by display type. Pearson's Correlation was utilized to examine the correlation relationships between the dependent variables (aesthetic response, <b>approach</b> <b>response</b> and perceived risk). A post hoc ANOVA analysis was run between gender and shopping value to examine gender differences in hedonic shopping value scores. Lastly, an exploratory analysis was conducted to provide the reader with ideas for future research in identifying specific demographic characteristics and their relationship to consumers' utilitarian shopping value. The results of this study support the significance of visual merchandising in a retail environment. The results demonstrate that all individuals (regardless of their gender or shopping value) had a higher aesthetic response (which led to an increased <b>approach</b> <b>response</b> and decreased perceived risk) to the clothing displayed in a full size mannequin display than to the flat hanging display. Unexpectedly, male respondents had a preference for the full size mannequin as did female respondents. Expectedly, females had a higher score for hedonic shopping value than males did in this study. Hedonic shopping value did not play a role as a moderator, whereas all respondents had a higher aesthetic response leading to an increased <b>approach</b> <b>response</b> and decreased perceived risk associated with the full size mannequin. This study offers further support for the S-O-R model introduced by Mehrabian and Russell (1974). The results of this study support the significance of visual merchandising by in a retail environment. This study suggests that a customer's mental imagery processing through viewing a retailers visual display can raise aesthetic response and therefore encourage <b>approach</b> <b>response</b> and reduce perceived risk associated with the products displayed. This study suggests that all consumers (regardless of gender or shopping value) prefer exciting, realistic and aesthetically pleasing visual displays, but require a full size mannequin display to raise their aesthetic response, <b>approach</b> <b>response</b> and reduce perceived risk associated with the items displayed. The limitations of this study include the use of convenience sampling which means {{the results of this study}} cannot be generalized beyond the product category (college licensed merchandise) and sample...|$|E
40|$|When {{measuring}} {{changes in}} {{quality of life}} (QL) with a pretest-posttest design, response shift can affect results. We investigated the convergent validity of three approaches to detect response shift. (1) In the thentest <b>approach,</b> <b>response</b> shift is measured using a retrospective judgment of pretest QL-levels (thentest). (2) In the anchor-recalibration <b>approach</b> <b>response</b> shift is measured, assessing shifts in patients' individual definitions of the scale-anchors (worst and best imaginable QL) over time. (3) In the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) <b>approach</b> <b>response</b> shift is indicated by mathematically defined changes in factor solutions and variance-covariance matrices over time. Prior to and three months after invasive surgery, 170 cancer patients completed the SF- 36, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (as pre-, post-, and thentest), and the anchor-recalibration task (as pre-, and posttest). Results showed agreement between the thentest and SEM approach on the absence (6 scales) and presence (2 scales) of response shift in 8 of the 9 scales. For the ninth scale both methods detected response shift, but in opposite directions. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. The anchor-recalibration task agreed with the other approaches on only the absence of response shift in 4 of the 7 scales. The convergent results of thentest and SEM support their validity, especially because they use statistically independent operationalizations of response shift. In this study, recall bias did not invalidate thentest result...|$|E

Objectives: The ability of pre-session infusions of a dopamine receptor agonist (R(+) 7 -OH-DPAT) to inhibit acquisition of a conditioned <b>approach</b> <b>response</b> was examined and {{compared with the same}} manipulation following overtraining. Further experiments extended these findings. Materials and methods: Experiment 1 infused pre-session intra-amygdala R(+) 7 -OH-DPAT (0, 0. 1, 1 nmol) during conditioned approach acquisition. Experiment 2 applied pre-session intra-amygdala R(+) 7 -OH-DPAT (0, 0. 01, 0. 1, 1 nmol) during expression of the same response, once well learned. Experiment 3 required the inhibition of a conditioned <b>approach</b> <b>response</b> following unconditioned stimulus (US) removal. Experiment 4 examined the ability of animals with prior drug experience to acquire a conditioned response to a novel stimulus. Results: Experiments 1 - 3 showed that pre-session amygdala R(+) 7 -OH-DPAT impaired acquisition of either excitatory or inhibitory conditioned responding, but was ineffective following overtraining. Drug-induced impairments in acquisition of a specific conditioned stimulus (CS) -US relationship continued well beyond the cessation of drug treatment, but were found not to transfer to an alternate CS in Experiment 4. Conclusions: Pre-session dopamine receptor activation within the amygdala may impair the acquisition, but not expression, of CS-US associations. Enhanced learning reported earlier following post-session dopamine receptor activation may occur indirectly through reduced interference with the consolidation of recent learning...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{prenatal}} auditory stimulations in {{the development}} of the postnatal <b>approach</b> <b>response</b> in young nidifugous birds is well known. However most of the studies in this area treat these stimulations as passive events. The purpose of this experimental series is to establish a link between prenatal stimulations and concomitant modifications of embryonic environment (warming and egg turning). Chicks were thus tested in a situation in which they could choose between two pure tones, one of which was or was not prenatally associated with these two stimuli. All chicks of the four groups used here were artificially incubated at the laboratory. After hatching, one-day-old subjects were placed three times a day for 3 days in a situation of choice between two pure tones (HFT = 1000 Hz or LFT = 500 Hz, of 200 ms duration played back every 3 seconds). The operant response (crossing over one of the two active zones  allows the subject to hear either HFT or LFT. Number and duration of passings over each active zone were recorded. Results of the first control experiment showed that from the first test day naive chicks displayed a spontaneous preference for the low frequency pure tone. Another group of chicks was prenatally stimulated with HFT. This did not significantly affect the initial preference. In a third group, prenatal stimulations were repeatedly associated with modifications of the embryo's environment, i. e., warming and egg rotation. Results showed that the expression of the spontaneous preference for LFT was significantly delayed.   The fourth group confirmed the specificity of this effect.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project {{was to develop a}} technique {{that can be used in}} field studies to increase the probability of locating dholes (Cuon alpinus) in the wild. The dhole is an endangered canid, occupying a wide variety of habitats in southern and eastern Asia. Dholes have proven to be a very difficult species to locate and study in the wild; therefore, the current status in much of its range, its ecology, and habitat requirements are not well known. Currently, field researchers lack a reliable method for capturing dholes in the wild, and nearly all field studies to date have been primarily observational in nature. This study evaluated the response of Chinese dholes (Cuon alpinus lepturus) to auditory playbacks employing a variety of vocalizations. The primary {{objective of this}} research was to determine a vocalization that would cause the dholes to approach the source of the sound. The subjects of this study were five captive dholes at the San Diego Wild Animal Park. The sounds used in playback can be divided into four different categories: dhole (unknown individuals), dOOle (known individuals), prey sounds, and control (white noise).

A blood odor component, E 2 D, has been shown to trigger <b>approach</b> <b>responses</b> identical to those triggered by the full blood odor in mammalian carnivores and as such, is a key candidate as a food/alarm cue in blood. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrate that E 2 D holds the dual function of affecting both approach and avoidance behavior in a predator-prey predicted manner. E 2 D evokes <b>approach</b> <b>responses</b> in two taxonomically distant blood-seeking predators, Stable fly and Wolf, while evoking avoidance responses in the prey species Mouse. We extend this by demonstrating that this chemical cue is preserved in humans as well; E 2 D induces postural avoidance, increases physiological arousal, and enhances visual perception of affective stimuli. This is the first demonstration of a single chemical cue with the dual function of guiding both approach and avoidance in a predator-prey predicted manner across taxonomically distant species, as well as the first known chemosignal that affects both human and non-human animals alike.
