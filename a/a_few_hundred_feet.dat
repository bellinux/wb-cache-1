5|$|NY5 {{enters the}} city of Utica on a {{concurrency}} with NY12 heading in a northeast direction. It shortly picks up NY8, and all three cross the city together. NY5 also intersects with the terminus of NY840 at this point. Just south of the New York State Thruway, I-790 begins as a short expressway, also including NY5, NY8, and NY12. After crossing out of the city, they meet the Thruway, with NY8 and12 continuing northeast, while I-790 and NY5 turn to the east-south-east, picking up the tail-end of NY49. These three, still as an expressway, straddle {{each side of the}} Thruway for a short way, with I-790 technically ending at the ramps for I-90. NY5 continues {{to the end of the}} expressway, only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> later, dropping to Leland Avenue. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>feet</b> to the north of the Thruway, NY5 turns eastward again to continue down Herkimer Road. It closely parallels the Thruway all the way to Herkimer, where NY5 moves slightly northward through the center of the village, becoming State Street, while I-90 crosses the Erie Canal and goes south for a short distance. There is a short concurrency with NY28 in the village.|$|E

50|$|To reduce pile distortion, the {{absorbent}} bonnet {{should be}} kept well-lubricated with cleaning solution. It is not recommended to dunk the bonnet in a bucket of cleaning solution and then wring {{it out with a}} mop-bucket wringer, as this will make the bonnet too wet. It is important to change or turn the bonnet early, as bonnets can become filled with soil in just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> square <b>feet.</b> Once loaded with soil, the bonnet will not hold any more; instead, it simply moves the soil from one area to another. An overly wet bonnet also deposits residues that attract soils when they are dry, creating the need to clean more often.

40|$|The Los Alamos National Laboratory (Laboratory) has {{supported}} this country through 50 {{years of research}} and development primarily in the area of nuclear weapons and energy. As a result of the Laboratory`s activities, contamination of the environment occurred. The cleanup of contaminated areas and the prevention of further contamination has become {{an important part of the}} Laboratory`s new mission: the reduction of the nuclear danger. The cleanup of the Laboratory is somewhat unique. It is a very large site. It includes 43 square miles of Laboratory land that will continue to be in industrial use or under institutional control for decades or centuries to come. It also includes about 25 square miles of former Laboratory land that has been converted to residential use, the Los Alamos townsite. The unusual topography and hydrogeology of the site was shaped during the last million years through the eruption of a huge volcano and the ensuing erosion of the tuff-basalt plateau into 19 canyons and associated finger-like mesas. During the early phase of the Environmental Restoration (ER) Program, 2, 100 sites were identified as potential release sites. Sites range from <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> square <b>feet</b> to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> acres in area. Contamination depths range from <b>a</b> <b>few</b> to 100 feet. Typical contaminants are chemicals, heavy metals, radioactive constituents, and high explosives. Of greatest concern are surface contamination, migration of the contaminants along the surface into creeks and arroyos of the canyons and ultimately into the Rio Grande, and migration through the earth into the drinking water aquifers...|$|R
5000|$|According to the notice: [...] In December 2004, Landry’s transported {{four white}} tigers to its Downtown Aquarium {{restaurant}} and amusement park complex in Houston, Texas. For the last 12 years, Landry’s has deprived these four tigers—named Nero, Marina, Coral, and Reef—of any access to sunlight, fresh air, or natural surfaces. These species-inappropriate living conditions violate the ESA, which has protected tigers since 1970.In the wild, tigers cover {{a range of}} up to 40 square miles. In contrast, at the Downtown Aquarium, the tigers’ entire world is limited to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> square <b>feet.</b> The tigers alternate their time between the concrete “Maharaja’s Temple” on display {{to the public and}} a small metal cage out of the public’s sight. At no point do the tigers have the opportunity to run, jump, or engage in the full range of their natural behaviors.“The dungeon-like conditions that the tigers are forced to endure at Houston’s Downtown Aquarium harm their physical health and psychological wellbeing, and deny them much that is natural and important to a tiger,” says renowned big cat veterinarian Dr. Jennifer Conrad. “It is cruel to confine complex, roaming carnivores such as tigers to a tiny, dark, artificial, unenriched enclosure where they never see any daylight, much less bask in sunshine, and are at risk for serious long term, debilitating injuries from being forced to live on slippery, unyielding concrete their entire lives.”The tigers’ living conditions starkly contrast with the decades-long trend to place captive tigers in more natural habitats, such as the tiger habitat at the Houston Zoo. Of the more than 100 Association of Zoos and Aquariums-accredited facilities housing tigers in the United States, only one other facility does not have an outdoor exhibit for the tigers: the Downtown Aquarium in Denver, also owned by Landry’s.“Tigers are complex apex predators with specific biological, environmental, and enrichment needs,” says Animal Legal Defense Fund Executive Director Stephen Wells. “Landry’s, Inc. should stick to the restaurant business and leave the housing of tigers to those who are able to provide big cats with proper care and naturalistic habitats rather than sacrificing the wellbeing of an endangered species for the sake of tourist dollars.”By forcing these tigers to live in what amounts to a concrete dungeon, Landry’s has profited financially, but caused the tigers serious mental and physical harm. Keeping the tigers at the Downtown Aquarium advances no conservation purpose under the ESA. Retiring the tigers to a sanctuary will guarantee that the tigers may spend {{the rest of their lives}} in the species-appropriate conditions that they need and deserve.|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on May 21, 2001. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, retaining little convection on its way. After moving across South America and the southwestern Caribbean Sea, the wave entered the eastern North Pacific Ocean on June 1. A low-level circulation developed on June 2, while it was about 230miles (370km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. Southerly flow forced the system northward, and the wave moved inland on June 3. The low-level circulation dissipated, though the mid-level circulation persisted. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on June 4, and developed deep convection on its eastern side.
