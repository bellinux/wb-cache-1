40|$|Background/Aims: Prior {{studies have}} {{consistently}} found {{a higher risk}} of dementia in individuals with schizophrenia, but whether this is due to a common etiology between the disorders remains obscure. We wanted to elucidate this association by investigating whether schizophrenia in offspring increases the risk of <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>dementia.</b> Methods: All individuals born between 1930 and 1953 were identified through national registers and followed from their 50 th birthday until the date of <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>dementia,</b> death or end of the study. Regressions were performed to evaluate the association between offspring with schizophrenia and <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>dementia.</b> Results: Individuals with offspring with schizophrenia did not have an increased risk of <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>dementia</b> [incidence rate ratio (IRR), 0. 97; 95 % CI, 0. 88 - 1. 07] compared to individuals with offspring without psychiatric contact. This finding remained stable when evaluating early-onset (IRR, 1. 10; 95 % CI, 0. 91 - 1. 31) and late-onset <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>dementia</b> (IRR, 0. 92; 95 % CI, 0. 88 - 1. 07). Similar findings were made for vascular and unspecified dementia. Conclusion: The finding of no familial coaggregation between schizophrenia and <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>dementia</b> may suggest that no common etiology between the disorders exists. This may indicate that the excess risk of dementia in individuals with schizophrenia is a by-product of the higher rates of somatic comorbidity and adverse health risk factors among these individuals...|$|R

40|$|Advances in neuroimaging, biomarkers, and {{clinical}} data {{have led to}} the hypothesis that the pathologic process of <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>dementia</b> begins decades prior to functional decline and diagnosis. 1 – 3 High-profile clinical trial results have shown that biomarker changes can be made via pharmacologic intervention; however, the timing of this intervention has likely been too late to impact the cascade of neurodegenerative changes. 4, 5 In “Comparison of symptomatic and asymptomatic persons with Alzheimer disease neuropathology” by Monsell et al., 6 neuropathologic {{and clinical}} data were used to determine the risk of developing clinically significant cognitive impairment. This work represents a significant contribution because it examines a large cohort of autopsy data, which includes patients with <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>dementia</b> neuropathology who were clinically normal or diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer-type dementia. The authors report a 3 -fold increase in the risk of cognitive symptoms in association with quantifiable increases in neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Additionally, several other factors including APOE gene status, history of depression, and age impacted the clinical presentation.

The influence of post-mortem delay, prolonged formol fixation and differences in clinical course on detection of plasma proteins by immunocytochemical techniques was also studied.

40|$|The elderly {{population}} of Norway is surging, {{and so is}} the use of medication for <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>dementia.</b> This paper seeks to investigate the validity of prescription guidelines as compared to current evidence regarding the novel drug memantine. Memantine is an expensive drug of modest effect, prescribed for moderate-to-severe <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>dementia.</b> Two meta-analyses supply the evidence: The well known Cochrane study of 2006 and the Lundbeck study of 2007. Lundbeck is the producer of Ebixa, Norway’s sole source of memantine. In this paper, both studies have their quality examined and the validity of prescription guidelines, memantine for moderate-to-severe <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>dementia,</b> are commented in light of the evidence gathered. Results: Both studies show slight, but clinically evident and significant effect on global and cognitive domains. Limitations: The Cochrane study comes out methodologically superior to the Lundbeck-study; the latter lacking as to the risk of bias. The studies are limited to a six-month duration and economical effects are unconfirmed. They differ somewhat on their definition of moderate-to-serious dementia. Implications for further research: Concomitant use with donepezil and effect on agitation may show promise and impact on family-burden is still unexplored, as is the effect on specific symtoms. Conclusion: Treatment of Alzheimers disease with memantine causes a marginal, but significant improvement in the domains of cognition and global assessment of dementia, confirming the validity of current prescription guidelines.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{changes of}} cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of patients on monotherapy with lopinavir/ritonavir. DESIGN: The Monotherapy Switzerland/Thailand study (MOST) trial compared monotherapy with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir with continued therapy. The trial was prematurely stopped due to virological failure in six patients on monotherapy. It, thus, offers {{a unique opportunity}} to assess brain markers in the early stage of HIV virological escape. METHODS: : Sixty-five CSF samples (34 on continued therapy and 31 on monotherapy) from 49 HIV-positive patients enrolled in MOST. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we determined the CSF concentration of S 100 B (astrocytosis), neopterin (inflammation), total Tau (tTau), phosphorylated Tau (pTau), and amyloid-β 1 - 42 (Aβ), the latter three indicating neuronal damage. Controls were CSF samples of 29 HIV-negative patients with <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>dementia.</b> RESULTS: In the CSF of monotherapy, concentrations of S 100 B and neopterin were significantly higher than in continued therapy (P =  0. 006 and P =  0. 013, respectively) and <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>dementia</b> patients (P <  0. 0001 and P =  0. 0005, respectively). In <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>dementia,</b> concentration of Aβ was lower than in monotherapy (P =  0. 005) and continued therapy (P =  0. 016) and concentrations of tTau were higher than in monotherapy (P =  0. 019) and continued therapy (P =  0. 001). There was no difference in pTau among the three groups. After removal of the 16 CSF with detectable viral load in the blood and/or CSF, only S 100 B remained significantly higher in monotherapy than in the two other groups. CONCLUSION: Despite full viral load-suppression in blood and CSF, antiretroviral monotherapy with lopinavir/ritonavir can raise CSF levels of S 100 B, suggesting astrocytic damage...|$|E

It has been known for some time that individuals with Down syndrome are more likely to develop Alzheimer Disease as they age due to the extra information of their chromosome 21, which contains the gene encoding the precursor protein beta-amyloid, favoring its formation and accumulation. This study provides an updated review of the literature on this topic, primarily focusing on the diagnostic problems encountered in these patients, in order to identify future lines of research...|$|E
40|$|Choices {{are often}} {{difficult}} to make by patients with <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>Dementia.</b> They often become acutely confused when faced with too many options {{because they are not}} able to retain in their working memory enough information about the various individual choices available. In this case study, we describe how an essentially simple benign task (choosing a dress to wear) can rapidly escalate and result in a catastrophic outcome. We examine what went wrong in the patient/caregiver interaction and how that potentially catastrophic situation could have been avoided or defused...|$|E
40|$|An {{epidemiological}} study {{was performed in}} Germany during the last 10 years to establish the frequency of Creutzfeldt-Jakob-disease (CJD). 1487 cases were reported as suspected CJD. 488 of these were definite (autopsy proven), 424 probable and 96 possible cases. 393 patients did not fulfil the diagnostic criteria. They had other diagnoses. <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>dementia</b> and Lewy-body-disease {{were the most important}} differential diagnosis. The new variant of CJD was not yet observed in Germany. As long as no diagnostic test is available during life, precautions are necessary. Persons at risk are excluded from blood- and organ donation...|$|E
50|$|Differentiating the {{different}} dementia syndromes can be challenging, {{due to the}} frequently overlapping clinical features and related underlying pathology. In particular, <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>dementia</b> often co-occurs with vascular dementia.|$|R
40|$|Apathy is {{the most}} common behavioralproblem {{associated}} with <b>Alzheimer’s</b> <b>dementia,</b> affecting 70 – 90 % of patients in various stages of dementia. It presents as lack of motivation, initiative, and per-sistence. Apathy has profound conse-quences for both patients and caregivers. The presence of apathy in <b>Alzheimer’s</b> <b>dementia</b> is linked to deficits in activities of daily living and functional decline, 1 as well as to a greater anterior cingulate neurofibrillary tangle burden 2 and the presence of ApoE epsilon 4 allele. 3 Apathy also serves as a behavioral marker for rapidly progressing dementia, with greater decline in cognitive, functional, and emo...|$|R

40|$|CONCLUSION The {{involvement}} of vascular factors in <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>dementia</b> was first appreciated over 100 years ago. Recently, significant advances in our under-standing of these brain-vascular relationships have taken place. Vascular cognitive impairment is now {{recognized as a}} distinct group of interrelated vascular-based neurological insults that can accu-mulate and lead to dementia. Importantly, the pathology of vascular cognitive impairment extends far beyond brain destruction wrought by major stroke. Other subtle changes may also arise that contribute to vascular cognitive impairment and dementia, including subclinical stroke, white-matter Address Correspondence to...|$|E
40|$|Dementia is {{a common}} {{neurological}} syndrome with amajor impact on the health {{and quality of life}} of theelderly. Although the causes of dementia are numer-ous, <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>dementia</b> (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are responsible for most cases. 1 Recent basic and clinical investigations have provided evidence that AD and VaD, traditionally considered distinct clinical and pathophysiolog-ical entities, may share common features. In this brief review, we will present these advances and a synthesis, focusing on the impact that this new information may have on the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to show that Cognitive Linguistics can provide the tools for a more {{fine-grained}} analysis of the results of the Mini Mental State Examination, which is used by clinicians to help diagnose <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>dementia.</b> First, it will be considered the structure of a sentence said by a patient, in an application of the test. Secondly, it will be examined the change of words performed by a patient. We try to show that this change was meaningful, from a cognitive point of view and not a simple error...|$|E
