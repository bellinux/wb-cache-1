5|$|A {{consequence}} of his perfectionism {{is that some}} artists who initially sign deals with Dr.Dre's <b>Aftermath</b> label never release albums. In 2001, <b>Aftermath</b> released the soundtrack to the movie The Wash, featuring a number of <b>Aftermath</b> acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on <b>Aftermath</b> and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr.Dre.

5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty in the <b>aftermath</b> of the Eurymedon.

The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted {{as if he had}} made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the <b>aftermath</b> of Eurymedon.|$|E
