50|$|Because agreeableness is {{a social}} trait, {{research}} has shown that one's agreeableness positively correlates with the quality of relationships with one's team members. Agreeableness also positively predicts transformational leadership skills. In <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>among</b> 169 participants in leadership positions in a variety of professions, individuals were asked to take a personality test and have two evaluations completed by directly supervised subordinates. Leaders with high levels of agreeableness {{were more likely to be}} considered transformational rather than transactional. Although the relationship was not strong, (r=0.32, &beta;=0.28, p<0.01) it was the strongest of the Big Five traits. However, the same study showed no predictive power of leadership effectiveness as evaluated by the leader's direct supervisor. Agreeableness, however, has been found to be negatively related to transactional leadership in the military. A study of Asian military units showed leaders with a high level of agreeableness to be more likely to receive a low rating for transformational leadership skills. Therefore, with further research organizations may be able to determine an individual's potential for performance based on their personality traits.|$|E
