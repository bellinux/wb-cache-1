5|$|Belgrade {{was one of}} {{the last}} big European capitals and cities with over <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>people</b> to have no metro/subway or other rapid transit system. The Belgrade Metro is {{considered}} the third most important project in the country, after work on roads and railways. The two projects of highest priority are the Belgrade bypass and the Pan-European Corridor X.|$|E

At the time, it was the largest gathering of protesters in Washington, D.C.'s history.|$|E

5|$|A Message from Earth (AMFE) is {{a high-powered}} digital radio signal {{that was sent}} on 9 October 2008 towards Gliese 581c, a large {{terrestrial}} extrasolar planet orbiting the red dwarf star Gliese 581. The signal is a digital time capsule containing 501 messages that were selected through a competition on the social networking site Bebo. The message was sent using the RT-70 radar telescope of Ukraine's State Space Agency. The signal will reach the planet Gliese 581c in early 2029. More than half <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>people</b> including celebrities and politicians participated in the AMFE project, which was the world's first digital time capsule where the content was selected by the public.|$|E

5|$|A novel {{vaccine for}} dengue fever has been {{approved}} and is commercially available {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>people</b> require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used.|$|E
5|$|Darby Creek {{flows through}} a narrow valley in its upper reaches and a tidal flat in its lower reaches. The creek is in the Piedmont Uplands and Atlantic Coastal Plain physiographic provinces. Major rock {{formations}} in the watershed include the Wissahickon Formation. Three small dams historically existed on the creek, but were removed in 2012. The watershed of the creek is largely developed, with roughly half <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>people</b> inhabiting it. Most of the watershed is in Delaware County, but some parts are in Chester County, Philadelphia County, and Montgomery County. The watershed {{is part of the}} Lower Delaware drainage basin.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 20th century {{to at least}} the mid-1980s, {{educational}} policies in Mexico focused on the hispanicization (castellanización) of indigenous communities, teaching only Spanish and discouraging the use of indigenous languages. As a result, today there is no group of Nahuatl speakers having attained general literacy in Nahuatl; while their literacy rate in Spanish also remains {{much lower than the}} national average. Even so, Nahuatl is still spoken by well over <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>people,</b> of whom around 10% are monolingual. The survival of Nahuatl as a whole is not imminently endangered, but the survival of certain dialects is, and some dialects have already become extinct within the last few decades of the 20th century.|$|E

Oxygène was followed in 1978 by Équinoxe, and in 1979, Jarre performed to a record-breaking audience of more than <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>people</b> at the Place de la Concorde, a record he has since broken three times. More albums were to follow, but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world. Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events, {{and he is now}} perhaps as well known as a performer as he is as a musician.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to agriculture, slave labor was increasingly used in mining, shipbuilding and other industries. The execution of Gabriel Prosser in 1800, Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831 and John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859 marked the growing social discontent over slavery {{and its role}} in the plantation economy. By 1860, almost half <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>people,</b> roughly 31% of the total population of Virginia, were enslaved. This division contributed {{to the start of the}} American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, Zyklon B {{emerged as}} the {{preferred}} killing tool of Nazi Germany for use in extermination camps during the Holocaust. Around <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>people</b> were killed using this method, mostly at Auschwitz. Tesch was executed in 1946 for knowingly selling the product to the SS for use on humans. Hydrogen cyanide is now rarely used as a pesticide, but still has industrial applications. Firms in several countries continue to produce Zyklon B under alternative brand names, including Detia-Degesch, the successor to Degesch, who renamed the product Cyanosil in 1974.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{the city}} walls, suburbs had sprung up {{providing}} {{homes for the}} craftsmen and tradespeople who flocked to the already overcrowded city. These were shanty towns with wooden shacks and no sanitation. The government had tried to control this development but had failed and {{over a quarter of}} <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>people</b> lived here. Other immigrants had taken over fine town houses, vacated by Royalists who had fled the country during the Commonwealth, converting them into tenements with different families in every room. These properties were soon vandalised and became rat-infested slums.|$|E
5|$|Protests {{continued}} in Alexandria and Mansoura, where Al Jazeera suggested up to <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>people</b> marched. In Cairo, Egyptian army tanks cleared a highway overpass from which pro-Mubarak protesters had been hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails onto the anti-Mubarak protesters. On the streets below, hundreds of armed soldiers lined {{up between the}} two factions, pushing the pro-Mubarak protesters back and blocking the main hotspots {{in front of the}} Egyptian Museum and at other entrances to the square. Violence was reported to have been perpetrated by police.|$|E

The major activity, which puts maximum pressure on these organisations, is the annual event of the Ratha Yatra held during June- July.

It was {{attended}} by nearly half <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>people.</b> They protested {{a variety of issues}} such as those of the previous demonstration, as well as the growing rate of inflation and the corruption scandals. Kirchner promised to keep her policies unchanged, and Senator Aníbal Fernández dismissed the significance of the demonstrations. Journalist Jorge Lanata explained the polarization was because the government and its supporters thought they were engaged in a revolution, and this justified being against freedom of the press and other public rights. Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina said the demonstrators belonged to a class that was against social justice, and compared the demonstrations to a coup d'état. A similar view was held by Kirchner's loyalists.|$|E
