5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1985, 17-year-old Darick Robertson was just {{finishing}} up high school. Already interested in art, he had begun sketching some anthropomorphic characters in comic book pages on typing paper with a pen to pass time during summer school. Michio Okamura, a talented artist and inker who {{was working as a}} security guard at a collection agency Robertson worked for at the time, noticed his work and offered to get his work in as a backup story in Komodo and the Defiants, a funny animal comic by small publisher Victory. Robertson began creating 11" [...] X 17" [...] full size inked artwork for the first time, with no training. Before that actually got published, he showed his work to the owner of San Mateo's Peninsula Comics, Tibor Sardy, who was impressed. Tibor Sardy, hoping {{to cash in on the}} current funny <b>animal</b> <b>black</b> and white comic trend that had launched the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and many copy-cats, began publishing Robertson's work in October 1986 in a black-and-white format as Space Beaver under the label Ten Buck Comics. While initial sales were high, both the black-and-white comic market boom and the funny animal comic market boom were both coming to a close. Additionally, the book received a 'D-' rating in Comics Buyer's Guide in 1987. As sales slowed, the comic was canceled in April 1989, having published 11 issues.|$|E
