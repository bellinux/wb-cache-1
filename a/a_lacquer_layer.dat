40|$|Background ECG (Electrocardiogram) {{measurements}} in {{home health}} care demands new sensor solutions. In this study, six different configurations of screen printed conductive ink electrodes have been evaluated with respect to electrode potential variations and electrode impedance. Methods The electrode surfaces consisted of a Ag/AgCl-based ink with a conduction line of carbon or Ag-based ink underneath. On top, <b>a</b> <b>lacquer</b> <b>layer</b> was used to define the electrode area and to cover the conduction lines. Measurements were performed under well-defined electro-chemical conditions in a physiologic saline solution. Results The results showed that all printed electrodes were stable and have a very small potential drift (less than 3  mV/ 30  min). The contribution to the total impedance was 2 % of the set maximal allowed impedance (maximally 1 kΩ at 50  Hz), assuming common values of input impedance and common mode rejection ratio of a regular amplifier. Conclusion Our conclusions are that the tested electrodes show satisfying properties {{to be used as}} elements in a skin electrode design that could be suitable for further investigations by applying the electrodes on the skin.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Microfluidic system comprises a circuit board with electrodes and <b>a</b> <b>lacquer</b> coating which is structure using photolithography or electron beams to leave the electrodes free. The lacquer consists of acrylic, epoxy, phenolic or silicone resins or fluoropolymer. A second layer is applied over this which has microchannels in its outer surface. This layer is made from SYLGARD (RTM; Dow Corning, polydimethylsiloxane), other organosiloxanes, their polymerization products, silicones, polyacrylates, e. g. polymethyl methacrylate, and/or elastomers with O- or N-containing functional groups, e. g. polysulfones, -imides, -carbonates and/or -acrylonitriles. The channels are {{in contact with the}} <b>lacquer</b> <b>layer</b> and bonded to it. The electrodes are positioned in the channels. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for making the microfluidic system by: (a) applying <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> of <b>lacquer</b> made from one of the polymers described above to a circuit board with electrodes on its surface; (b) structuring the <b>lacquer</b> <b>layer</b> using photolithography or electron beams to leave the electrodes free; (c) applying a layer to this which has microchannels in its outer surface; and (d) bonding it to the <b>lacquer</b> <b>layer</b> so that the electrodes are positioned in the channels.

5000|$|Making <b>a</b> <b>lacquer</b> {{painting}} {{may take}} several months {{depending on the}} technique used {{and the number of}} <b>layers</b> of <b>lacquer.</b> In Vietnam's sơn mài <b>lacquer</b> painting first <b>a</b> black board is prepared. Then outlines in chalk are picked out in white with eggshell and clear varnish, then polished. Then the first <b>layer</b> of coloured <b>lacquer</b> is applied, usually followed by silver leaf and another <b>layer</b> of clear <b>lacquer.</b> Then several more layers of different coloured lacquers are painted by brush, with clear <b>lacquer</b> <b>layers</b> between them. In Vietnam an artist may apply up to ten layers or more of coloured and clear lacquer. In Ming China processes included up to a hundred layers. Each layer requires drying and polishing. When all layers are applied the artist polishes different parts of the painting until the preferred colours show. Fine sandpaper and a mix of charcoal powder and human hair is used to carefully reach the correct layer of each specific colour. Consequently, [...] "lacquer painting" [...] is in part a misnomer, since the bringing out of the colours is not done in the preparatory painting but in the burnishing of the <b>lacquer</b> <b>layers</b> to reveal the desired image beneath.|$|R

A critical level of fluence and number of pulses was required to ablate each of the additional layers. Four threshold levels of damage have been identified as i) damage to the upper <b>lacquer</b> <b>layer</b> without removal, ii) the removal of the <b>lacquer</b> <b>layer,</b> iii) the removal of the intermediate layers and iv) the removal of all layers.
