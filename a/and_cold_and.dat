5|$|For many years, the Moon {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent site for telescopes. It is relatively nearby; astronomical seeing is not a concern; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark <b>and</b> <b>cold,</b> <b>and</b> thus especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes {{on the far side}} would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth. The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter. A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid.|$|E

5|$|Jacobs are {{typically}} hardy, low-maintenance animals with a naturally high resistance to parasites and hoof problems. Jacobs {{do not show}} much flocking behaviour. They can be skittish if not used to people, although with daily handling they will become tame and make good pets. They require shelter from extreme temperatures, but the shelter can be open and simple. They tend to thrive in extremes of heat <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> have good or excellent foraging capabilities. They can secure adequate nutrition with minimal to no supplementation, even {{in the presence of}} suboptimal soil conditions.|$|E
5|$|Paxton's cavalry {{met with}} Lane's {{infantry}} {{at a point}} on Cold Knob Mountain around noon on November 26.

Paxton also considered ending the mission, but decided to continue after being convinced by Major Powell. Powell was assigned to lead the advance guard, and selected Lieutenant Jeremiah Davidson and 20 men from Company G to join him. The advance guard, followed {{by the rest of}} the cavalry regiment, proceeded down the mountain toward the rebel camps.|$|E

The reserve in Michoacán contains the highest elevations in the state, including peaks that reach 2,700 masl (metres above sea level). The climate is classified as being temperate and somewhat moist with a rainy season in the summer. The average maximum temperature is 22°C (71°F).

25|$|In Majorca one {{can still}} visit the (then-abandoned) Carthusian monastery of Valldemossa, where {{she spent the}} winter of 1838–1839 with Chopin and her children. This trip to Majorca was {{described}} by her in Un hiver à Majorque (A Winter in Majorca), first published in 1841. Chopin was already ill with incipient tuberculosis (or, as has recently been suggested, cystic fibrosis) {{at the beginning of}} their relationship, and spending a winter in Majorca—where Sand and Chopin did not realize that winter was a time of rain <b>and</b> <b>cold,</b> <b>and</b> where they could not get proper lodgings—exacerbated his symptoms. They separated two years before his death for a variety of reasons.|$|E
25|$|Stellar {{remnants}} are objects {{associated with}} the death of stars. Because the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is observational in nature, these remnants cannot easily be plotted on the diagram, or cannot be placed at all. Neutron stars are relatively small <b>and</b> <b>cold,</b> <b>and</b> would fall far {{on the left side of}} the diagram. Planetary nebulae are dynamic and tend to quickly fade in brightness as the progenitor star transitions to the white dwarf branch. If shown, a planetary nebula would be plotted to the left of the diagram's upper left quadrant. A black hole emits no visible light of its own, and therefore would not appear on the diagram.|$|E
25|$|Hazards {{associated}} with water systems in buildings include physical, chemical and microbial hazards. In 2013, NSF International, {{a public health}} and safety NGO, established education, training and certification programs in HACCP for building water systems. The programs, developed with the guidance of subject matter experts Aaron Rosenblatt and William McCoy center on the use of HACCP principles adapted to the specific requirements of domestic (hot <b>and</b> <b>cold)</b> <b>and</b> utility (HVAC, etc.) water systems in buildings, to prevent plumbing-associated hazards from harming people. Hazards addressed include scalding, lead, and disinfection byproducts as well as a range of clinically important pathogens, such as Legionella, Pseudomonas, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), Acinetobacter, Elizabethkingia, and Naegleria. Early adopters of HACCP for building water systems include leading healthcare institutions, notably Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.|$|E

25|$|In 1867, Griffith Dickenson Compton led a {{group of}} 30 pioneers to the area. These {{families}} had traveled by wagon train south from Stockton, California in search of ways {{to earn a living}} other than in the rapid exhaustion of gold fields. Originally named Gibsonville, after one of the tract owners, it was later called Comptonville. However, to avoid confusion with the Comptonville located in Yuba County, the name was shortened to Compton. Compton's earliest settlers were faced with terrible hardships as they farmed the land in bleak weather to get by with just the barest subsistence. The weather continued to be harsh, rainy <b>and</b> <b>cold,</b> <b>and</b> fuel was difficult to find. To gather firewood it was necessary to travel to mountains close to Pasadena. The round trip took almost a week. Many in the Compton party wanted to relocate to a friendlier climate and settle down, but as there were two general stores within traveling distance—one in the pueblo of Los Angeles, the other in Wilmington—they eventually decided to stay put.|$|E
25|$|While {{traversing}} Wildermore {{in search}} of ways to oppose Nurzum, the player and his companions unexpectedly come across Nona. Since her departure in Eaworth, {{she made her way}} to the city of Byre Tor, which has been razed by Nurzum, and cared for the survivors, her hatred for Men of Rohan lessened by the kind actions. Her reunion with Horn is brief <b>and</b> <b>cold,</b> <b>and</b> not having yet resolved her feelings for him, she chooses to leave again. The others follow her to a cave where she hides survivors from the snow, among them Harding's son Leodwig, injured but alive. Seeing wrath of Nurzum firsthand, Corudan the Elf decides to search for aid among the Ents of the nearby Fangorn Forest. He and the player manage to find and wake the Ent Leaflock (Finglas) and relay him Nuzum's story. The Ent cares little for troubles of Men, but defiling of Huorn's remains rouses him to anger and he commands Huorns of the forest to come after the giant. Nurzum fights off the attack, but is weakened and later defeated by the player and Heroes of Wildermore. Meanwhile, Nona and Horn resolve their feelings and finally commit to each other.|$|E

500|$|Simpson's {{essay was}} not well known and did not become {{influential}} until Lionel Trilling quoted it in 1957. Another prominent writer whose Austen criticism was ignored, novelist Margaret Oliphant, described Austen in almost proto-feminist terms, as [...] "armed with a 'fine vein of feminine cynicism,' 'full of subtle power, keenness, finesse, and self-restraint,' blessed with an 'exquisite sense' of the 'ridiculous,' 'a fine stinging yet soft-voiced contempt,' whose novels are 'so calm <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> keen'". This line of criticism would not be fully explored until the 1970s {{with the rise of}} feminist literary criticism.|$|E
500|$|As {{the cloud}} tops of {{tropical}} cyclones are high <b>and</b> <b>cold,</b> <b>and</b> their air is humid – their rainwater is 'lighter'. In other words, the rainfall contains significantly higher quantities of unevaporated Oxygen-18 than other tropical rainfall. The isotopically lighter rainwater soaks into the ground, percolates down into caves, and, {{within a couple}} of weeks, Oxygen-18 transfers from the water into calcium carbonate, before being deposited in thin layers or 'rings' within stalagmites.
