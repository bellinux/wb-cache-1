In antiquity it was beside the divine will which a man performs, just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> will of sexual desire. The intention of the individual was less understood as an overall, generalized, ontological place wherever it was arranged.|$|E

A unified political {{system could be}} maintained {{only as long as}} the government had the means of quickly dispatching officials, troops, or messengers as needed.

At the local level, road and bridge projects seem to have been initiated <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sake of traveling merchants as for officials.|$|E

25|$|Standards of play {{can vary}} from semi-professional to {{occasional}} recreational level. While many clubs train in similar ways to professional teams, village or park cricket is played purely for fun, and club cricket is often enjoyed <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> social element as for the competition.

Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote that We Are X was, [...] "fascinating and assured documentary", but also mentioned {{what he thought was}} an unfair R-rating saying: [...] "We Are X is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for — what?

500|$|All Things Must Pass {{received}} {{almost universal}} critical acclaim on release – <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> music and lyrical content {{as for the}} fact that, of all the former Beatles, it {{was the work of}} supposed junior partner George Harrison. Beatles author Robert Rodriguez has written of critics' attention being centred on [...] "a major talent unleashed, one who'd been hidden in plain sight all those years" [...] behind Lennon and McCartney. [...] "That the Quiet Beatle was capable of such range," [...] Rodriguez continues, [...] "from the joyful 'What Is Life' to the meditative 'Isn't It a Pity' to the steamrolling 'Art of Dying' to the playful 'I Dig Love' – was revelatory." [...] Most reviewers tended to discount the third disc of studio jams, accepting that it was a [...] "free" [...] addition to justify the set's high retail price, although Anthony DeCurtis recognises Apple Jam as further evidence of the album's [...] "bracing air of creative liberation".|$|E

500|$|Collins {{described}} the album {{as not being}} as easy listening as their previous work, and that it contained numerous experiments in songwriting {{that they had not}} put into previous albums. Fanning later said Internationalist was [...] "a better record" [...] than Double Allergic, but acknowledged that it was not as easily likeable—it was just an improvement in songwriting. Collins and Fanning acknowledged that the album's experimental nature could lose them some old fans, but the pair drew parallels with bands such as U2, who Collins said had [...] "constantly re-invented themselves, and with success". He said Powderfinger's reinvention was <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> band's own interest as it was for the [...] "public's perception". Meanwhile, guitarist Ian Haug {{described the}} album as a [...] "moderation" [...] between Parables for Wooden Ears ("the complicated beast") and Double Allergic ("totally simplified"), Powderfinger's two previous albums. He also agreed that the album was much more experimental, and described the album as the band's [...] "most successful", as well as stating that the album that best replicated [...] "the sound we have live".|$|E
500|$|The news of Ferrier's death {{came as a}} {{considerable}} shock to the public. Although some in musical circles knew or suspected the truth, the myth had been preserved that her absence from the concert scene was temporary. The opera critic Rupert Christiansen, writing as the 50th anniversary of Ferrier's death approached, maintained that [...] "no singer {{in this country has}} ever been more deeply loved, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> person she was as for the voice she uttered". Her death, he continued, [...] "quite literally shattered the euphoria of the Coronation" [...] (which had taken place on 2 June 1953). Ian Jack, editor of Granta, believed that she [...] "may well have been the most celebrated woman in Britain after the Queen." [...] Among the many tributes from her colleagues, that of Bruno Walter has been highlighted by biographers: [...] "The greatest thing in music in my life has been to have known Kathleen Ferrier and Gustav Mahler—in that order." [...] Very few singers, Lord Harewood writes, [...] "have earned so powerful a valedictory from so senior a colleague." [...] At a memorial service at Southwark Cathedral on 14 November 1953 the Bishop of Croydon, in his eulogy, said of Ferrier's voice: [...] "She seemed to bring into this world a radiance from another world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Baldini's {{analysis}} {{of the structure of}} the score in relation to the drama (and the comparison between the two versions) is highly detailed and worthy of examination.

[...] Writing in the Grove Dictionary, musicologist Roger Parker sees the opera as revealing Verdi's [...] "attention to detail and sureness of effect unprecedented in earlier works.

Hal Montgomery said that while his father and Jack Montgomery were [...] "not friends" [...] when the 1967 campaign began, they were [...] "not enemies" [...] after Harold Montgomery's return to the state senate. Hal Montgomery also said that politics was frequently discussed in the Montgomery household {{when he was growing}} up in the 1960s, but he never shared his father's interests in politics.|$|E
2500|$|As Gabriele Baldini in The Story of Giuseppe Verdi {{examines}} this opera, {{the quality}} of the libretto preoccupies him over several pages, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> unsuitability of Maffei as a librettist as his lack of skill in crafting Schiller's story into an acceptable libretto. He stresses the fact that Maffei's strengths lay in the field of translation, mostly from the German and English literature, and Baldini sums him up as [...] "neither a poet nor a good man of letters... who found himself at the centre of cultural currents to which he was contributing nothing really vital". [...] Implicit, therefore, is the notion - as noted in the quotation from Basevi below under [...] "Music" [...] - of whether composer and librettist were really suited to each other. [...] Musicologist Julian Budden, who describes Maffei's libretto as [...] "indigestible", agrees with this assessment when he states that, along with Salvadore Cammarano, the librettist employed by the composer {{for the first time in}} 1845 to write Alzira, there was [...] "an exaggerated regard on Verdi's part for the librettist" [...] and he continues: [...] "such complaisance [...] was a bad sign." ...|$|E
