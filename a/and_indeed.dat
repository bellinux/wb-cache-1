In 1980 AFL–CIO officer Lane Kirkland appointed Kahn to organize the AFL–CIO support for the Polish labor-union Solidarity, which was maintained <b>and</b> <b>indeed</b> increased even after protests by the USSR and Carter administration.|$|E
5|$|Alexios Komnenos (born in {{the early}} 1160s), who was {{recognised}} as the emperor's son, <b>and</b> <b>indeed</b> received a title (sebastokrator). He was briefly married to Eirene Komnene, illegitimate daughter of Andronikos I Komnenos, in 1183–1184, and was then blinded by his father-in-law. He lived until at least 1191 and was known personally to Choniates.|$|E
5|$|Also {{called the}} Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus, this species was {{originally}} classified as Hippopotamus along with H. lemerlei, <b>and</b> <b>indeed</b> {{the two species}} were roughly the same size. A review of their morphology and habitat, however, suggested a closer relationship to the modern pygmy hippopotamus.|$|E

5|$|Marking Specter's {{entire career}} in the Senate <b>and,</b> <b>indeed,</b> in all his public offices was one {{overriding}} fact: First and foremost, he considered himself essentially a trial attorney rather than a professional politician.

5|$|Mu'azzam's {{imprisonment}} was not severe, <b>and</b> <b>indeed</b> he {{was kept}} {{in the lap of}} luxury by his captors. This was the custom with regard to high-born and potentially useful captives, and it was quite normal for captive and captor to become friends and even allies. Shivaji's own son, Sambhaji, was at roughly the same time a prisoner of the Mughals.|$|E

5|$|The Earldom of Northumberland {{was then}} one of the {{greatest}} landholdings in northern England; Percy also became Lord Poynings on his marriage.

5|$|The sleepwalking {{scene is}} one of the more celebrated scenes from Macbeth, <b>and,</b> <b>indeed,</b> in all of Shakespeare. It has no {{counterpart}} in Holinshed's Chronicles, Shakespeare's source material for the play, but is solely the bard's invention.|$|E

5|$|Although Braille was {{admired and}} {{respected}} by his pupils, his writing system was not {{taught at the}} Institute during his lifetime. The successors of Valentin Haüy, {{who had died in}} 1822, showed no interest in altering the established methods of the school, <b>and</b> <b>indeed,</b> they were actively hostile to its use. Dr. Alexandre François-René Pignier, headmaster at the school, was dismissed from his post after he had a history book translated into braille.|$|E
5|$|At the Canning Dam <b>and</b> <b>indeed</b> all dams, care had to {{be taken}} to prevent water seepage between the {{foundation}} rock and the structure of the dam. At the Canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a cut-off trench was sited near the upstream face of the dam, down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of the dam. The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) cut-off drains were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete.|$|E

5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, <b>and</b> <b>indeed</b> fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1079 and 1532, Winchester Cathedral has had {{an unusual}} {{architectural}} history. The exterior, apart from the modified windows, gives {{the impression of a}} massive Norman building <b>and</b> <b>indeed,</b> it is the longest medieval church in the world. However, the west front is now Perpendicular, with its huge window filled with fragments of medieval glass. Inside, only the crypt and the transepts have retained their Norman appearance. The spectacular Perpendicular nave with its tall arcade arches and strong vertical emphasis has been literally carved out of the original Norman interior. The Very Rev. Sykes wrote of it “Well might the visitor who enters … by the west door gasp with amazement.” Winchester is also famous for its carved wooden fittings of many different periods.|$|E
5|$|Cannan resumed {{command of}} the 15th Infantry Battalion in Egypt on 21 January 1916. It {{departed}} Alexandria for Marseilles on 1 June 1916, to join the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. Cannan led his battalion into action again at the Battle of Pozières and Battle of Mouquet Farm. On the night of 8 August 1916, the 15th Infantry Battalion launched {{an attack on the}} German trench in front of Mouquet Farm known as Park Lane. Cannan's men captured their objectives, <b>and</b> <b>indeed</b> went beyond them in some places. However, the Suffolk Regiment on his flank was mown down by German machine gun fire and Cannan was compelled to withdraw part of his force to a more defensible position.|$|E
