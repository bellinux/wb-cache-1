Development began soon after Grand Theft <b>Auto</b> IVs release and was led by Rockstar North's core 360-person team, who collaborated with several other international Rockstar Games studios. The team considered the game a spiritual successor to many of their previous projects like Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3. After its unexpected announcement in 2011, the game was fervently promoted with press showings, cinematic trailers, viral marketing strategies and special editions. Its release date, though subject to several delays, was widely anticipated.|$|E

5|$|Grand Theft <b>Auto</b> III {{is an open}} world action-adventure third-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by DMA Design and published by Rockstar Games. It was released in October 2001 for the PlayStation 2, in May 2002 for Microsoft Windows, and in October 2003 for the Xbox. A remastered version of the game was released on mobile platforms in 2011, for the game's tenth anniversary.

5|$|Grand Theft <b>Auto</b> III {{took the}} {{gameplay}} {{foundation of the}} first two Grand Theft <b>Auto</b> games and expanded it into a 3D world, and offered an unprecedented variety of minigames and side-missions. The title was a much greater commercial success than its direct precursors, and its influence was profound. As such, Grand Theft <b>Auto</b> III is credited with popularizing this genre, let alone inventing it. Its release is sometimes treated as a revolutionary event in the history of video games, much like the release of Doom nearly a decade earlier. GamePro called it the most important game of all time, and claimed that every genre was influenced to rethink their conventional level design. IGN similarly praised it {{as one of the top}} ten most influential games of all time. Subsequent games that follow this formula of driving and shooting in a free-roaming level have been called Grand Theft <b>Auto</b> clones.|$|E

Another technical patch was released on 10 October combating the issues and Rockstar offered a GTA$500,000 (in-game currency) stimulus to the accounts of all players connected to Online since launch as recompense. Because of the widespread technical issues present at launch, many reviewers bemoaned their Grand Theft <b>Auto</b> Online experience, but generally recognised its open-ended exploration and dynamic content as strengths.|$|E
