5|$|Under {{the auspices}} of <b>a</b> <b>régime</b> d'exception (the {{equivalent}} {{of a state of}} emergency), Mobutu assumed sweeping, almost absolute, power for five years after which, he claimed, democracy would be restored. Mobutu's coup, which promised both economic and political stability, was supported by the United States and other Western governments. Initially, his rule met widespread popularity. He increasingly took other powers, abolishing the post of Prime Minister in 1966 and dissolving Parliament in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{judicial}} system still existed in Buenos Aires, Rosas removed any independence the courts might have exercised, either by controlling appointments to the judiciary, or by circumventing their authority entirely. He {{would sit in}} judgement over cases, issuing sentences which included fines, service in the army, imprisonment, or execution. The exercise of state terror {{as a tool of}} intimidation was restricted to Rosas himself; his subordinates had no control over it. It was used against specific targets, rather than randomly. Terrorism was orchestrated rather than a product of popular zeal, was targeted for effect rather than indiscriminate. Anarchic demonstrations, vigilantism and disorderliness were antithetical to <b>a</b> <b>regime</b> touting a law and order agenda. Foreigners were exempted from abuses, as were people too poor or inconsequential to serve as effective examples. Victims were selected for their usefulness as tools of intimidation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{theoretically}} {{evaluates the}} dynamic {{effects of a}} shift in an exchange rate system from <b>a</b> fixed <b>regime</b> to <b>a</b> basket peg, or to <b>a</b> floating <b>regime,</b> and obtains transition paths for the shift based on a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of a small open economy. We apply quantitative analysis {{using data from the}} People's Republic of China and Thailand and find that a small open country would be better off shifting to a basket peg or to <b>a</b> floating <b>regime</b> than maintaining <b>a</b> dollar-peg <b>regime</b> with capital controls over the long run. Furthermore, due to the welfare losses associated with volatility in nominal interest rates, the longer the transition period, the larger the benefits of shifting suddenly to <b>a</b> basket-peg <b>regime</b> from <b>a</b> dollar-peg <b>regime</b> than proceeding gradually. Regarding sudden shifts to desired regimes, the welfare gains are higher under a shift to a basket peg if the exchange rate fluctuates significantly. Finally, shifting to <b>a</b> managed-floating <b>regime</b> is less attractive than moving to a basket peg, as the interventions necessary to maintain the exchange rate for certain periods result in higher losses and the authority lacks monetary policy autonomy...|$|R

When this proved incapable of producing a stable government in 1659 Monk opened negotiations with Charles II and began a slow march south with his army. After reaching London he restored the English Long Parliament that had existed {{at the beginning of the}} civil wars. This body, having received some assurances from Charles II, voted for a restoration of the monarchy in England and then dissolved itself. This created a de facto restoration of the monarchy in Scotland, but without any safeguards as to the constitutional position in the country. Scottish notables were in a weak position in negotiations with the crown as to what the settlement would be.|$|E
5|$|From newly {{captured}} Xi'an, {{in early}} April 1645 the Qing mounted {{a campaign against}} the rich commercial and agricultural region of Jiangnan south of the lower Yangtze River, where in June 1644 a Ming imperial prince had established <b>a</b> <b>regime</b> loyal to the Ming. Factional bickering and numerous defections prevented the Southern Ming from mounting an efficient resistance. Several Qing armies swept south, taking the key city of Xuzhou north of the Huai River in early May 1645 and soon converging on Yangzhou, the main city on the Southern Ming's northern line of defense. Bravely defended by Shi Kefa, who refused to surrender, Yangzhou fell to Manchu artillery on 20 May after a one-week siege. Dorgon's brother Prince Dodo then ordered the slaughter of Yangzhou's entire population. As intended, this massacre terrorized other Jiangnan cities into surrendering to the Qing. Indeed, Nanjing surrendered without a fight on 16 June after its last defenders had made Dodo promise he would not hurt the population. The Qing soon captured the Ming emperor (who died in Beijing the following year) and seized Jiangnan's main cities, including Suzhou and Hangzhou; by early July 1645, the frontier between the Qing and the Southern Ming had been pushed south to the Qiantang River.|$|E
5|$|John Thomas Perceval, {{the son of}} Spencer Perceval, {{spent about}} a year at Brislington House, from 1831 until February 1832, {{followed}} by two years at Ticehurst House, Ticehurst in Sussex. In Brislington House Perceval experienced, {{in spite of the}} expense, <b>a</b> <b>regime</b> of deprivation, brutality and degradation. For eight months, during which time he was completely under the control of his voices, spirits and presences, he was kept under restraint, either in a straitjacket or tied down in bed.

He was later {{one of the founders of}} the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society and acted as their honorary secretary for about twenty years. Perceval's two books about his experience in asylums were republished by the anthropologist Gregory Bateson in 1962, and in recent years he has been hailed as a pioneer of the mental-health advocacy movement.|$|E

5|$|On 19 April 1978 a {{prominent}} leftist named Mir Akbar Khyber was assassinated {{and the murder}} was blamed on Mohammed Daoud Khan's Republic of Afghanistan. His death served as a rallying point for the pro-communist Afghans. Fearing a communist coup d'état, Daoud ordered the arrest of certain PDPA leaders, including Taraki and Karmal, while placing others such as Hafizullah Amin under house arrest. On 27 April 1978 the Saur Revolution was initiated, reportedly by Amin while still under house arrest. Khan was killed the next day along with most of his family. The PDPA rapidly gained control and on 1 May Taraki became Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, a role which subsumed the responsibilities of both president and Chairman of the Council of Ministers (literally prime minister in Western parlance). The country was then renamed the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA), installing <b>a</b> <b>regime</b> that would last until April 1992.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly, Roa Bastos' own {{experiences}} {{played a significant}} role in his emphasis on human suffering. As a young man he fought in the Chaco war between Bolivia and Paraguay, an event he portrayed in Hijo de hombre. Later he saw the devastation of WWII at first hand in Europe, the violent strife of 1947 in Paraguay, and the rise of the Argentinian military dictatorship in 1976. His collection of short stories published in 1953, El trueno ebtre las hojas, set the stage for Hijo de hombre and Yo, el Supremo with its dark portrayal of devastating political struggle and oppression. Two decades later, Yo, el Supremo was published, providing a prime example of Roa Bastos' idea of the engaged writer. It offered an unflattering, fictionalized account of the final thoughts and ramblings of Paraguay's first dictator, at a time when Paraguay was under the stranglehold of <b>a</b> <b>regime</b> that adopted many of the same policies of oppression and isolationism. Roa Bastos was not alone in using literature to engage in contemporary events during the Latin American Boom period. In the 1960s and 1970s, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and others adopted the same approach. Together, these writers created the Dictator novel genre.|$|E
5|$|In 743, {{after the}} death of Caliph Hisham, Walid II {{reconfirmed}} Nasr in his post, but the influential governor of Iraq, Yusuf ibn Umar al-Thaqafi, an opponent of Nasr, tried to lure him away from his province by calling him to Iraq. Nasr delayed his departure, stalling for time, and was saved by the murder of Walid in April 744. However, Walid's successor, Yazid III, moved to install <b>a</b> <b>regime</b> dominated by the Yemeni Kalbi tribe. Nasr's position was severely undermined, and the Yemeni faction now hoped to see their leader Juday' al-Kirmani appointed governor in his stead. Indeed, Yazid appointed his favourite, the Kalbi Mansur ibn Jumhur, as governor of Iraq, and he in turn nominated his own brother as Nasr's replacement. Nasr refused to accept this, and was again fortunate in his persistence, for Mansur fell out of favour and was dismissed after only two months. Agitation among the Yemeni faction persisted, amidst rumours that Nasr had intercepted letters appointing al-Kirmani as governor, and a dispute on the payment of stipends to the muqatila. Nasr tried to secure his own position by deposing al-Kirmani from his leadership of the Azd, as well as by trying to win over Azd and Rabi'ah leaders. This led to a general uprising by the Azd and Rabi'ah under al-Kirmani. It is indicative of the lingering intertribal antagonism of the late Umayyad world that the rebellion was launched in the name of revenge for the Muhallabids, an Azd family that had been purged after rebelling in 720, an act which had since become a symbol of Yemeni resentment of the Umayyads and their northern Arab-dominated regime.|$|E
40|$|The {{essence of}} the {{argument}} in the paper comes from a possible dichotomy between exchange rate and monetary policies. Many transition economies adopted exchange rate regimes characterised by different degrees of flexibility and management. Several countries, including the Czech Republic, adopted <b>an</b> exchange <b>regime</b> based on <b>a</b> currency basket peg. In {{the case of this}} fixed exchange rate <b>regime,</b> <b>a</b> country has by definition <b>an</b> exchange <b>regime</b> policy, gives up its own monetary policy, and the origin of a monetary base is purely a foreign one. The exact opposite is true for <b>a</b> floating exchange <b>regime.</b> <b>A</b> crucial difference arises in the case of <b>a</b> pegged <b>regime</b> whereby <b>a</b> country maintains both exchange rate and monetary policies. Under such an arrangement, eventual conflict between these two policies is likely to materialise. Such a conflict may eventually evolve into a balance of payments crisis. ...|$|R

Comparing the current position of Egypt with some emerging market economies, the conclusions of the study are as follows: (i) the CBE is not factually independent. Although the CBE has been granted legal instrument independence, the existence of government representatives as voting members on the MPC and the coercion of the CBE to extend finance to the government are two elements sufficient to undermine the de facto independence of the CBE; (ii) inflation targets are expected to be missed under the possibility that the behavior of the CBE will be similar to the behavior of the majority of emerging market economies, i. e., adopting <b>an</b> IT <b>regime</b> whereas implicitly targeting FX rates; and (iii) the current level of knowledge about some central issues of designing <b>an</b> IT <b>regime</b> and the quality of the available data are not satisfactory to support the adoption of <b>an</b> IT <b>regime.</b> The study concludes that Egypt is still not ready to apply <b>an</b> IT <b>regime.</b> Prerequisites for <b>an</b> inflation targeting <b>regime,</b> Inflation targeting regime, Inflation targeting in Egypt...|$|R
