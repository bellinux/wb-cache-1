50|$|The 4th Strategic Air Depot (originally the 3rd Advanced Air Depot {{and then}} 3rd Technical Air Depot) {{serviced}} {{many types of}} aircraft but, by late 1943, was concentrating on fighter types. An <b>additional</b> <b>technical</b> <b>area</b> with four T2 hangars, some eighteen hardstands and a taxiway loop joining the airfield perimeter track, were constructed {{on the south side}} of the airfield. An engineering complex in temporary buildings was built around this area, chiefly in the village of Nedging Tye.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to determine, as {{witnessed}} by cooperating teachers, what learning gaps pre-service teachers brought to the student teaching experience. A revised version of Duncan, Ricketts, Peake, and Uesseler (2005) needs assessment instrument was used to gather data from cooperating agriculture teachers that were on the state approved list in Georgia (N= 52). The findings of this study indicate that the pre-service teachers need <b>additional</b> preparation in <b>technical</b> <b>areas</b> such as plant science, agriscience, and integrating current advances in agriculture technology into the curriculum. Cooperating teachers felt that the pre-service teachers needed assistance in the areas of FFA, public relations, preparing various award applications and developing SAEâ€™s for students. Pre-service teachers also need assistance in developing teaching skills such as managing student behavior problems, motivating students to learn, teaching students to think critically and creatively, embedding graduation standards into the curriculum, establishing an advisory committee, and completing state and local reports. Therefore, it was recommended that the learning gaps of the pre-service teachers be addressed by university faculty and state agricultural education staff...|$|R

5000|$|On March 31, 2010, {{the mayor}} of Regensburg made an {{official}} application to the Bavarian government that an <b>additional</b> <b>Technical</b> University suggested by the government should go to Regensburg.
