40|$|Abstract: To {{examine the}} effects of lead on glucose {{metabolism}} in the spinal cord, glucose utilization rate (GUR) and distribution volume of glucose (DV) in the anterior horn and white matter were determined in 9 rats exposed to lead for 4 weeks and 10 control rats. The GUR <b>and</b> <b>DV</b> were determined by the quantitative microdetermination method using non-tracer amount of 2 -deoxyglucose based on the three-compartments model of Sokoloff. The GUR <b>and</b> <b>DV</b> in the anterior horn in the lead-exposed rats were significantly lower than those in the controls. It is thus suggested that glucose metabolism, as measured by the GUR <b>and</b> <b>DV,</b> in the anterior horn is inhibited by lead; the anterior horn cells seem sensitive to lead neurotoxicity...|$|R
