He developed an interest in film editing {{and moved on to}} Gainsborough Pictures, where he gained further experience. In 1947 he was conscripted for national service with the Royal Air Force. He was based at RAF Manston, an airfield near Margate, and served part of his time in air traffic control. On one occasion, a Spitfire was coming in to land. It was only about 50 feet above the ground before the runway controller alerted the pilot to the fact the plane's undercarriage hadn't lowered. The pilot opened up the throttle and climbed away. As this was a moment Anderson always remembered, he found it <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> write about aircraft when he devised stories for Thunderbirds. After completing his military service, he returned to Gainsborough, where he worked until the studio was closed in 1950. He then worked freelance on a series of feature films.|$|E

40|$|Programs for {{training}} {{teachers of the}} learning disabled frequently seek to specify the competencies needed for adequate on-the-job performance. Dissatisfaction with the competency-based approach springs from the belief that i t might foster a technician-oriented teacher, one more concerned with procedures than with children. Though competency-based teacher training programs need not theoretically ignore humanistic concerns, i t is <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> not <b>to</b> recognize the needs of both teacher and child and their interaction when specifying measurable competencies. This interesting report of a teacher training program describes the integration of humanistic and competency-based orientations. - G. M. S. This paper presents a model for integra-tion of two philosophies of teacher education. The model uses humanistic education as the process {{for training}} specijcic competencies identified in a competency-based teacher education program. A description of the develop-ment {{and implementation of the}} pro-gram is reported as an example of application of the model. Graduates of the program perceive tliemselves as having improved their competency {{to meet the needs of}} learning disabled children, a perception corroborated by the children’s progress and by an evalua-tion one year after training. widely held belief among educators A is that quality education is due substantially to the competency and effectiveness of teachers. Unfortunately, emphasis in program planning for learn-ing disabled students is most often placed on securing financial support, curricular adaptations, and administra-tive arrangements for providing instruc-tion in schools. Given the importance of the teacher in the education process, surprisingly little attention is given in professional literature to a discussion of how best to train needed professional personnel.

30|$|All these {{previous}} points {{raise the}} need for usefully critical research and writing. As the articles in this special issue show, being critical of digital technology in higher education does not entail a blanket dismissal of all things technological. It is <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> for people <b>to</b> slip into dystopian fears of universities being ruined beyond repair by developments in digital education. Moreover, academic critique of digital higher education should not be conducted with a ‘moralizing undertone’ (Massumi, 2015, p. 14). As Banks and Deuze (2009, p. 425) warn, critical academic observers are not somehow “lifting the veil from the eyes of otherwise hapless participants”. Students, staff and institutions {{who are involved in}} the forms of digital education described above are certainly not ‘dupes’ whose failings are only apparent to the outside academic observer. Thus, critical accounts of higher education and technology should strive to offer different - rather than better - perspectives on the topic. Critical scholars should not be dismissive or discounting of other approaches. As Rita Felski (2015) reminds us, just because other work is not critical does not mean that it is uncritical. Thus, critical studies need to be conducted in a generous, open-minded spirit if they are to find a place in the general educational technology firmament.|$|R

40|$|Marketing {{research}} {{is concerned with}} developing and analyzing the “facts ” that help marketing managers {{do a better job}} of planning, executing and controlling. Marketing {{research is}} much more than a bundle of techniques or a group of specialists in survey design or statistical techniques. Good marketing researchers must be both marketing and management orientated to assure that their research focuses on real problems on which action can be taken. Today, many marketing planners are isolated in company or offices far from their potential customers. For this reason, they must rely on research to be sure they know what is going on. This point cannot be over-emphasized because it is <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> for management <b>to</b> lose touch with its markets. One of the critical tasks of the marketing researcher is to help management get the “facts ” and understand them. The many potential markets in the United States and abroad are not necessarily like the markets lived in by the typical middle-class suburban managers. Marketing research details may be handled by staff or outside specialists but marketing managers must know how to plan and evaluate research projects. That is, they should be able to communicate with specialists in their language. They may only be “consumers ” of research, but they should be knowledgeable consumer, perhaps regularly specifying what they want to buy. For this reason, our treatment of marketing research will not focus on mechanics, but rather on how to plan and evaluate research. The marketing researcher must excel in these areas also, so in the following discussion, we will take the marketing researcher’s view, realizing that both of them should participate in the research process if the results are going to lead to action.

40|$|This {{volume is}} edited by Tim Waterman and Joshua Zeunert, who will {{contribute}} an introduction and section introductions, and each will also contribute a chapter. Joshua Zeunert teaches at Deakin University in Australia. The book will comprise approximately 35 chapters. The landscape architect Matthew Potteiger has observed that “food and landscape are mutually constituted. ” From the growing and gathering {{of food to}} its distribution, procurement, cooking, sharing, consumption, and managing waste, food is a fundamental element {{of all of our}} human landscape narratives. Our earliest human interactions with our environments would have been primarily concerned with food, and indeed, while the shape of those interactions has changed with the rise of agriculture and of cities, they still remain basic to the forms in which we make our societies, our cultures, our languages, and our built environments. Consciously or unconsciously, landscape planning and landscape architecture largely ignore everyday food landscapes. The mechanised, growth-centric form agriculture developed through the ‘Green Revolution’ has driven the ‘culture’ from agriculture and a defunct labour force into urban areas. In the developed world, the culture of food is now focused largely on consumption, and other aspects of food and foodways including processes of production, distribution, sale, and marketing are hidden or obfuscated. Global food systems are have enormous ecological footprints and continue to reshape much of the earth's habitable landmass. In the developing world, where significant numbers are undernourished, food processes are often centred around subsistence or bulk production for distant markets. The necessities of each can obliterate food and landscape traditions and heritages as well as ecologies. There is much of interest to food studies in the urban landscape as well, from the practices and land uses associated with markets, for example, or the concentration of restaurants in dining districts, or small interventions on rooftops and warehouses. Food customs and landscape customs are intermingled in places everywhere from food banks to sidewalk cafés to the private garden. It is now <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy,</b> though, <b>to</b> forget the intimate ways that urban and rural are linked and that clear definitions of either are impossible to describe. Urban and rural are increasingly being understood as hybridised and coexisting systems whose separation is artificial. The Routledge Handbook of Landscape and Food will seek to address the hybridity of urban and rural, including intermediary zones such as suburbs and urban fringes. Five sections are proposed, in which we will seek to exhaustively identify and explain the realms where food and landscape are mutually constituted. They are: History and archaeology Agriculture (urban and rural) Food systems Policy and planning Sociocultural food landscape...|$|R

40|$|Researchers {{have been}} {{challenged}} by Indigenous scholars regarding the ongoing re-inscription of colonialist paradigms inflicted through research methodologies and later perpetuated through published work (L. T. Smith, 1999 / 2012). Within both education and educational research, “repressive structures of colonialism operate through an invisible network of filiative connections, psychological internalizations and unconsciously complicit associations” (Kaomea, 2004, p. 22). Throughout the eras of both colonisation and modernity Indigenous knowledges have been marginalised by the academy, rendered invisible, dismissed as inferior, and {{relegated to the}} status of historical relics. The education system in Aotearoa (New Zealand), like many other countries colonised by Great Britain, has explained Māori underachievement as being the result of the ‘deficit’ of Māori, rather than of the educational experiences that were provided for them. These ‘deficit theories’ “can be traced back to nineteenth-century ‘scientific racism’, which was itself a development of – and justification for – imperialism and colonialism” (Human Rights Commission, 2012, p. 15). Māori academics in Aotearoa (New Zealand) have been cautious about ‘post-’ modern/structural/colonial paradigms, considering that more work is needed than mere neo-colonialist re-languaging of imperialism (Pihama, 1993; L. T. Smith, 1999 / 2012). “Decolonization, once viewed as the formal process of handing over the instruments of government, is now recognized as a long-term process involving the bureaucratic, cultural, linguistic and psychological divesting of colonial power” (Pihama, 1993, p. 98). It is <b>all</b> <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> for researchers <b>to</b> ignore the underlying impacts of the legacy of colonisation and its discourse of Māori as ‘deficit’ within their research contexts, thus inadvertently perpetuating these effects. In Aotearoa, some Indigenous and Pākehā (European ancestry) educational researchers have worked collaboratively to illuminate decolonising possibilities (Bishop & Glynn, 1999; Jones & Jenkins, 2008; Rau & Ritchie, 2014; Ritchie & Rau, 2010, 2012). This methodology has been described as ‘partnership research’ which “involves both indigenous and non-indigenous researchers working on a research project and shaping that project together” (Smith, 1999, p. 178). This paper reflects on some of the aspects, issues, and tensions arising from a series of research projects within the field of early childhood care and education which upheld a commitment to counter-colonial praxis...|$|R
