5|$|Hancock's {{time in the}} West was brief. President Johnson, {{unhappy with}} the way Republican generals were {{governing}} the South under Reconstruction, sought replacements for them.

5|$|On July22, 1916, a bomb {{exploded}} during the San Francisco Preparedness Day Parade, killing ten people and wounding 40.

French losses were more severe, with four casualties on Indivisible and six killed and 23 wounded on Dix-Août, <b>although</b> <b>neither</b> ship was significantly damaged in the action.|$|E

5|$|Marion Little {{examines}} theoretical frameworks {{related to}} NVC. The influential interest-based model for conflict resolution, negotiation, and mediation developed by Fisher, Ury, and Patton at the Harvard Negotiation Project in the 1980s {{appears to have}} some conceptual overlap with NVC, <b>although</b> <b>neither</b> model references the other. Little suggests The Gordon Model for Effective Relationships (1970) as a likely precursor to both NVC and interest-based negotiation, based on conceptual similarities, if not any direct evidence of a connection. Like Rosenberg, Gordon had worked with Carl Rogers, so the models' similarities may reflect common influences.|$|E
5|$|Operation Overlord {{finally ended}} on 14 June and 1 ATF {{returned}} to Nui Dat.

Indeed, although the fighting continued, Australian operations began to wind down. On 18 August 1971, Prime Minister William McMahon announced that 1 ATF would cease operations in October, commencing a phased withdrawal. Ultimately, the last Australian forces were withdrawn from Vietnam by 1973.|$|E
