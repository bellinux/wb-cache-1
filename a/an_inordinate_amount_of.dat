5|$|The Water Boiler was an aqueous {{homogeneous}} reactor, a type {{of nuclear}} reactor in which the nuclear fuel {{in the form of}} soluble uranium sulfate is dissolved in water. Uranium sulfate was chosen instead of uranium nitrate because sulfur's neutron capture cross section is less than that of nitrogen. The project was proposed by Bacher in April 1943 as part of an ongoing program of measuring critical masses in chain-reacting systems. He saw it also as a means of testing various materials in critical mass systems. T Division were opposed to the project, which was seen as a distraction from studies related to the form of chain reactions found in an atomic bomb, but Bacher prevailed on this point. Calculations related to the Water Boiler did take up <b>an</b> <b>inordinate</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> T Division's time in 1943. The reactor theory developed by Fermi did not apply to the Water Boiler.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{policy changes}} in United States {{agriculture}} have brought added importance to risk management for farms. The 1995 Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act has set forth legislation which gradually reduces government payments to farms through 2002, exposing farmers to increasing levels of risk. This study analyzed {{the financial and}} production results for two cotton farms in the Texas High Plains, then projected the future viability of each farm as its level of risk increased. The simulation results indicated that Farm 1 could remain profitable despite rising levels of debt and uncertainty, as shown by a probability of survival of 100 %. Farm 2 's probability of survival was only 60 %, with the difference between producers primarily due to {{a difference in the}} cash cost to receipts ratio, which is a measure of operating efficiency. General Problem Risk {{is one of the many}} challenges confronting any business manager. Agribusiness firms, however, face <b>an</b> <b>inordinate</b> <b>amount</b> and variety <b>of</b> risks. Crop and livestock performance depends on biological processes which are affected by weather, diseases, insects, weeds, feed conversion, and soil fertility (Kay and Edwards, 1994). The uncertainty associated with these biological processes is referred to in agriculture as production uncertainty (Lee et al, 1988). Agriculturalists are also subject to higher levels of market risk than are producers in other industries. Since th...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discussed}} how fine-grain synchronization can be supported on <b>a</b> multiprocessor without <b>inordinate</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> hardware, and described Alewife's implementation. The paper motivated {{the use of}} fine-grain synchronization as an attractive method of synchronizing programs that avoids unnecessary serialization, and hence maximizes concurrency. We argued that efficient fine-grain synchronization requires support {{at all levels of}} a multiprocessor system. Driven by the desire the control the complexity of hardware, we identified successful synchronizations to be the common case in fine-grain synchronization and provided hardware support for that case. The system handles the common case of successful synchronizations very fast, in fact at virtually the same speed as normal, non-synchronizing reads and writes. Experimental results indicate that a high percentage of fine-grain synchronization operations succeed. Failed synchronizations that need to wait are detected via traps and handled entirely in software. The trap handlers implement sophisticated waiting algorithms that rely on useful information from the compiler to reduce the cost of waiting. The compiler communicate this information to the trap handlers using otherwise unused bits in the instruction. For programmability, we provide language support in parallel versions of C and T to allow a user to specify fine-grain synchronization in a straightforward manner. We have implemented a number of parallel programs that utilize fine-grain synchronization specified with the provided language support. The resulting system needs very little hardware support such {{that we were able to}} implement a processor that supports our design for fine-grain synchronization by making minor modifications to the LSI Logic SPARC, an existing [...] ...|$|R
