5|$|A {{good example}} of {{convergence}} in plants is the evolution of edible fruits such as apples. These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium. Other edible fruits include other plant tissues; for example, the fleshy part of <b>a</b> <b>tomato</b> is {{the walls of the}} pericarp. This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, in this case the competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} {{significant}} human impact {{is a small}} prefabricated hut which is used by researchers while staying on the island. The hut includes a few bunk beds and a solar power source to drive an emergency radio and other key electronics. All visitors check themselves and belongings to ensure no seeds are accidentally introduced by humans to this ecosystem. It is believed that some young boys tried to introduce potatoes, which were promptly dug up once discovered. An improperly handled human defecation resulted in <b>a</b> <b>tomato</b> plant taking root which was also destroyed.|$|E

25|$|RoboMary {{can examine}} the {{computer}} brain of similar non-color-locked robots {{when they look}} at <b>a</b> red <b>tomato,</b> and see exactly how they react and what kinds of impulses occur. RoboMary can also construct a simulation of her own brain, unlock the simulation's color-lock and, with reference to the other robots, simulate exactly how this simulation of herself reacts to seeing <b>a</b> red <b>tomato.</b> RoboMary naturally has control over all of her internal states except for the color-lock. With the knowledge of her simulation's internal states upon seeing <b>a</b> red <b>tomato,</b> RoboMary can put her own internal states directly into the states they would be in upon seeing <b>a</b> red <b>tomato.</b> In this way, without ever seeing <b>a</b> red <b>tomato</b> through her cameras, she will know exactly {{what it is like to}} see <b>a</b> red <b>tomato.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Campari is <b>a</b> type of <b>tomato,</b> {{noted for}} its juiciness, high sugar level, low acidity, and lack of mealiness.

All of Meg's reasonable and sometimes rational suggestions are shot down by Peter and Chris in favor of their more unusual and nonsensical ideas. Peter eventually fires Meg. He and Chris then decide on a joke involving a wood stove and a house of cards, and invite Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe to voice the characters. Although {{it is suggested that}} the crudely animated and developed pilot episode will likely fail, CEO Peter Chernin enjoys it and agrees to air the show, but Peter becomes angered when he suggests that the character Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose be a plum instead of <b>a</b> <b>tomato.</b> Peter's passion about his work impresses Chernin into allowing him to air the episode unedited, but he decides not to let the episode be aired at all, which he later regrets.|$|E

For the next forty years Woodland continued growing, slowly but steadily, in population, businesses and industries. Its economic growth was based mainly in agriculture-related businesses; three rice mills, a sugar beet refinery, and <b>a</b> <b>tomato</b> cannery were built during this time.|$|E

Influenced by Pee-wee's Playhouse, which Iwai had seen during his tenure at the Exploratorium in the United States, the show was imaginative and irreverent and featured talking TVs, <b>a</b> <b>tomato</b> that gave advice to call-in guests, a robot named Robot that asked riddles and broke down when given silly answers, anthropomorphic faeces named Professor Poo Poo, and a cubo-surrealist artist named Surr. Ugo Ugo Lhuga is 'go-go girls' anagrammed in Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Eggplant {{is often}} stewed, {{as in the}} French ratatouille. Eggplant is also often deep fried as in the Italian parmigiana di melanzane, the Turkish karnıyarık, or Turkish and Greek musakka/moussaka, and Middle Eastern and South Asian dishes. Eggplants can also be {{battered}} before deep-frying and served with a sauce made of tahini and tamarind. In Iranian cuisine, it is blended with whey as kashk e bademjan, tomatoes as mirza ghassemi, or made into stew as khoresh-e-bademjan. It can be sliced and deep-fried, then served with plain yogurt (optionally topped with <b>a</b> <b>tomato</b> and garlic sauce), {{such as in the}} Turkish dish patlıcan kızartması (meaning fried aubergines), or without yogurt, as in patlıcan şakşuka. Perhaps the best-known Turkish eggplant dishes are imam bayıldı (vegetarian) and karnıyarık (with minced meat).|$|E
25|$|The Pittston Tomato Festival, in its twenty-eighth year in 2011, is held {{annually}} on South Main Street in Downtown Pittston {{to celebrate the}} city's tradition and heritage in cultivating the tomato. The Tomato Festival began during the first term of Mayor Thomas Walsh (in the early 1980s). On average, nearly fifty thousand people attend the four-day event that has been touted {{as one of the}} best festivals in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Delicious food (from food vendors throughout the Greater Pittston region), a variety of live entertainment, games, rides, arts and crafts, bingo, and of course home-grown Pittston tomatoes keep bringing an enthusiastic crowd to the festival year after year. The event also consists of a beauty pageant, <b>a</b> <b>tomato</b> tasting contest, a best looking and ugliest tomato contest, a 5km run through the city, tomato fights, and a parade. In May 2011, Parade Magazine cited the Pittston Tomato Festival in one of its articles.|$|E

25|$|Stalin {{worked into}} the evenings, eating lunch at 4 or 5pm and dinner no earlier than 9pm; other senior {{political}} figures had to accommodate his unusual working patterns. He {{spent much time}} in the Kremlin cinema, where he enjoyed watching films with other high-ranking officials late at night; he had a particular fondness for the Western genre. Stalin enjoyed alcoholic beverages, and at dinner parties and other social events would encourage those around him to join in, hoping that in a drunken state they would reveal secrets. He enjoyed practical jokes, for instance by putting <b>a</b> <b>tomato</b> on the seat of Politburo members and waiting for them to sit on it, and encouraged singing at social events. As an infant, Stalin had displayed a love of flowers, and later in life he became a keen gardener. His dacha in the Moscow suburb of Volynskoe was surrounded by a 50-acre park, with Stalin devoting much attention to its agricultural activities. Stalin was also an accomplished billiards player.|$|E
25|$|Angus burgers – Four types: the Angus Deluxe (American cheese, sliced {{red onions}} and sliced red tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, pickles, mustard, and {{mayonnaise}}); Angus Mushroom and Swiss (sautéed mushrooms, Swiss cheese and mayonnaise); Angus Bacon and Cheese (bacon, American cheese, sliced red onions, mustard, ketchup and pickles); and the Angus Chipotle BBQ Bacon (chipotle sauce, red onions, pickles, bacon, and American cheese). In Australia and New Zealand, {{there are three}} Angus burgers sold; The Grand Angus (which is a clone of the Angus Deluxe) and the Mighty Angus (which resembles the Angus Cheese and Bacon, but with no pickles and mayonnaise and onion relish replacing the ketchup and mustard). For a limited time only, the Angus The Third, similar to the Grand Angus, but with no mustard and made with <b>a</b> <b>tomato</b> chili relish and only one slice of cheese. Also, for a limited time, Angus the Great was sold, a clone of the Angus Mushroom and Swiss. In October 2012, an Angus version of the Cheddar Bacon Onion (CBO) Sandwich was made available, consisting of a horseradish-like sauce, grilled caramelized onions, bacon and cheddar cheese. In May 2013, McDonald's stopped selling the Angus burger. Two years later the third-pound burgers returned (known as Sirloin Third Pound Burgers), but as a limited-time promotion. It comes in three sandwiches: Bacon & Cheese, Lettuce & Tomato, and Steakhouse. The Angus Burgers are still available in Canada and some markets in Latin America.|$|E
500|$|In {{everyday}} language, {{the words}} [...] "fruit" [...] and [...] "vegetable" [...] are mutually exclusive. [...] "Fruit" [...] has a precise botanical meaning, {{being a part}} that developed from the ovary of a flowering plant. This is considerably different from the word's culinary meaning. While peaches, plums, and oranges are [...] "fruit" [...] in both senses, many items commonly called [...] "vegetables", such as eggplants, bell peppers, and tomatoes, are botanically fruits. The {{question of whether the}} tomato is a fruit or a vegetable found its way into the United States Supreme Court in 1893. The court ruled unanimously in Nix v. Hedden that <b>a</b> <b>tomato</b> is correctly identified as, and thus taxed as, a vegetable, {{for the purposes of the}} Tariff of 1883 on imported produce.
