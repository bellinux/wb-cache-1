5|$|The {{brooding}} anemone (Epiactis prolifera) is gynodioecious, starting life <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> {{and later}} becoming hermaphroditic, so that populations consist of females and hermaphrodites. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>female,</b> the eggs can develop parthenogenetically into female offspring without fertilisation, {{and as a}} hermaphrodite, the eggs are routinely self-fertilised. The larvae emerge from the anemone's mouth and tumble down the column, lodging in a fold near the pedal disc. Here they develop and grow, remaining for about three months before crawling off to start independent lives.|$|E
5|$|Fang was {{originally}} scripted to be a male character {{during the early}} stages of Final Fantasy XIIIs development, but early in the writing stage, was rewritten <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> character. Along with this, the sex appeal that {{was originally}} {{going to be part of}} Lightning's look was transferred to Fang to give Lightning a more hard-edged persona. Fang is voiced by Rachel Robinson in English, and Mabuki Andou in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Joss Whedon wrote Gediman as a corrupt, twisted {{character}} whose amoral activities {{would become}} clear {{later in the}} film. With the casting of Brad Dourif, however, Whedon felt that the mystery element was compromised because Dourif is commonly cast in unsettling roles. In Alien Woman: The Making of Lt. Ellen Ripley, Jason Smith and Ximena Gallardo-C. describe Gediman's dominance of Number 8 as similar to Wren's, Gediman sees her <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> predator, and Wren views her as a beastly object.|$|E

5|$|Representations of America <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> Native American, or Indian princess, dated {{back to the}} 16thcentury; cartographers {{would place}} a native woman, often wearing a {{feathered}} headdress, upon their version of the North American continent. This evolved into an image of an Indian queen, then an Indian princess, and although Columbia eventually came to be the favored female embodiment of the United States, {{the image of the}} Indian princess survives in the popular view of such figures as Pocahontas and Sacagawea.|$|E
5|$|Tamar's {{association}} with the period of political and military successes and cultural achievements, combined with her role <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> ruler, has led to her idealization and romanticization in Georgian arts and historical memory. She remains an important symbol in Georgian popular culture and has been canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church as the Holy Righteous Queen Tamar (წმიდა კეთილმსახური მეფე თამარი, ts'mida k'etilmsakhuri mepe tamari), with her feast day commemorated on 14 May (O.S. 1 May).|$|E

5|$|While {{the name}} Sigyn is found <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> {{personal}} name in Old Norse sources (Old Norse sigr meaning 'victory' and vina meaning 'girl-friend'), and though in surviving sources she is largely restricted {{to a single}} role, she appears in the 9th century skaldic poem Haustlöng from pagan times, written by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir. Due to this early connection with Loki, Sigyn has been theorized as being a goddess dating back to an older form of Germanic paganism.|$|E
5|$|Following the Great Fire of Smyrna, Lefty and Desdemona {{must start}} life anew. When she is 14years old, Callie {{experiences}} a second birth to become Cal. To become a male, Callie peregrinates across the United States {{and becomes a}} midwife of her new life by teaching herself to forget what she has learned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>female.</b> Likewise, Cal's grandparents undergo a transformation, becoming husband and wife instead of brother and sister. Middlesex delves into the concept of identity, including how it is formed {{and how it is}} administered. The immigrant predicament is a metaphor and synecdoche for Calliope's hermaphroditic condition; Callie's paternal grandparents become Americanized through the amalgamation of the elements of heredity, cultural metamorphoses, and probability. Callie's maternal grandfather, Jimmy Zizmo, undergoes a rebirth when he transforms from a bootlegger into Fard Muhammad, a Muslim minister.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Antestor {{was signed}} by Endtime Productions, a metal record label that also helped to start the career of the Norwegian metal band Extol. The {{original}} vocalist Kjetil Molnes (Martyr) left Antestor. However, the breakup of another Christian metal band in Norway, Vaakevandring, led to several former Vaakevandring members joining Antestor. Namely, Ronny Hansen, adopting the new moniker Vrede, became Antestor's new vocalist, and Morten Sigmund Mageroy (known in Antestor as Sygmoon) stepped in as the new keyboardist. Ann-Mari Edvardsen, who has sung in the Norwegian gothic metal group The Third and the Mortal, joined the band <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> vocalist. For {{the first time in}} their career, Antestor began using the infamous corpse paint masks as a part of their live shows and overall image.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, she co-starred with Lisa Dergan in The Arena, a Roger Corman-produced, direct-to-video movie {{directed}} by Timur Bekmambetov. The entire production {{was shot in}} Russia. In her feature film debut, McDougal's character, Jessemina, is a slave girl who is forced into fighting <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> gladiator in an Ancient Roman colony by its corrupt governor. The role offered McDougal her first opportunity {{to act in a}} dramatic role and to demonstrate her physical abilities with the movie's sword fighting sequences. The movie, initially titled Gladiatrix was deemed to be a knockoff of Gladiator. Although the movie was not well received, it has turned into a lesser known cult film.|$|E

5|$|Nanako is {{an extreme}} tomboy with an {{insensitive}} personality. Like Akira Uehara, she becomes popular with the students and Akira's parents after the exchange due to her personality and Akira's masculine appearance. Initially Nanako intended {{to return to her}} body after having fun as a male and was very strict on how Akira treated her body. She resolves to stay in Akira's body and relents her body's ownership to Akira after she falls completely in love with her friend, Makoto Shiina. Her parents learn about the exchange and are supportive of the statusquo as they accept Nanako's hopelessness <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>female.</b> She is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro in the three radio dramas and is portrayed by Mai Takahashi in the live action film.|$|E
5|$|On September 8, 1995, Cedar Point {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} new roller coaster, which would open as the tallest, fastest, and longest stand-up roller coaster in the world. The ride was to be named Banshee after the mythical wailing ghost in Irish folklore. In the days following the announcement, there was some negative reaction from the public regarding the term Banshee, which in the dictionary is described <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> spirit that warns of an impending family death. On November 14, 1995, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company filed a trademark for the name Mantis, which later became the ride's official name. As a result of the name change, its logo was also changed to resemble a mantis. The discarded name would later be reused for Banshee at Kings Island which opened in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Sophie {{conducted}} {{experiments with}} parachutes {{as her husband}} had, parachuting dogs from her balloon, {{and as part of}} her entertainments she launched fireworks and dropped baskets of pyrotechnics attached to small parachutes. Other aeronauts were making names for themselves by demonstrating parachute jumps from the baskets of balloons, in particular the family of André-Jacques Garnerin, whose wife, daughter and niece all performed regularly. His niece, Élisa Garnerin, was Blanchard's chief rival <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> aeronaut, and it was rare for a suitable event to lack a performance by one or the other. Blanchard may have given some demonstrations of parachuting herself, but her primary interest was in ballooning.|$|E
