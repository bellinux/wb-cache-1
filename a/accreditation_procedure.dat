40|$|International {{audience}} BACKGROUND: Allergen-specific {{serum immunoglobulin}} E detection and quantification {{have become an}} important step in allergy diagnosis and follow-up. In line with the current trend of laboratory test accreditation to international standards, we set out to design and assess an <b>accreditation</b> <b>procedure</b> for allergen-specific serum IgE. METHODS: Method validation according to the <b>accreditation</b> <b>procedure</b> under the EN ISO 15189 standard was carried out for allergen-specific immunoglobulin E determination using the fluoroimmunoenzymatic method ImmunoCAP(®) (ThermoFisher). Data were produced by 25 hospital laboratories in France. A total of 29 allergen specificities including mixes, extracts, and molecular allergens were assayed. Allergen-specific serum immunoglobulin E concentrations ranged from 0. 1 to 100  kUA /l. RESULTS: Repeatability, reproducibility, and accuracy results fulfilled method validation criteria for automated laboratory tests and proved similar irrespective of the allergen specificity, allergen-specific serum immunoglobulin E concentration, or individual laboratory. CONCLUSION: Allergen-specific serum immunoglobulin E determination with the fluoroimmunoenzymatic method ImmunoCAP(®) is a highly repeatable, reproducible, and accurate method which may be considered as a single analyte assay in view of the EN ISO 15189 <b>accreditation</b> <b>procedure.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{educational}} activities {{initiated by the}} International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) have had global impacts and influenced national societies and local academic programs {{in the field of}} Biomedical and Health Informatics (BMHI). After the successful publication and dissemination of its educational recommendations, IMIA launched an <b>accreditation</b> <b>procedure</b> for educational programs in BMHI. The <b>accreditation</b> <b>procedure</b> was pilot tested by several BMHI academic programs in different countries and continents to obtain a global perspective. Methods: This paper presents an overview of IMIA quality assurance and accreditation procedures along with feedback on issues and problems which emerged during the pilot. Results: It appears that IMIA quality assurance and procedures worked quite well in different countries of Europe, the Middle East, South America, and Asia. These first experiences provided adequate information for adapting, modifying, and optimizing the procedures and finally for the planning of future activities. Conclusions: IMIA accreditation framework comprises a single set of standards that apply at various levels to both academic and professional BMHI programs. The pilot phase confirmed the robustness and generalizability of quality assurance standards and associated procedures on which IMIA accreditation is based at an international leve...|$|E

40|$|Health {{informatics}} programs {{usually are}} evaluated by national accreditation committees. Not always are {{the members of}} these committees well informed about the international level of (education in) health informatics. Therefore, when a program is accredited by a national accreditation committee, this does not always mean that the program is of an international level. The International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) has expertise {{in the field of}} education. The IMIA Recommendations on Education in Biomedical and Health Informatics guide curricula development. The goal {{of this article is to}} show that IMIA can also play the role of accreditation agency and to present the IMIA accreditation protocol and experiences obtained with it. The <b>accreditation</b> <b>procedure</b> used in the Netherlands and Belgium was taken as a template for the design of the IMIA accreditation protocol. In a trial period of one and a half year the protocol is tested out on six health informatics programs. An accreditation protocol was designed. For judging the curriculum of a program the IMIA Recommendations are used. The institution has to write a self-assessment report and a site visit committee visits the program and judges its quality, supported by the self-assessment report and discussions with all stakeholders of the program. After having visited three programs it appears that the IMIA <b>accreditation</b> <b>procedure</b> works well. Only a few changes had to be introduced.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} principle that EQF and ECVET {{have in common}} is the description of qualifications in terms of learning outcomes. The background for implementing this outcome-based approach in the European education and training systems, however, is quite diverse. This situation is addressed by the CREDIVOC project, which involves partners from Austria, Finland, France, Germany and Ireland and focuses on the identification, testing and transfer of instruments {{that can be used for}} the recognition and accreditation of learning outcomes from initial and continuing vocational education and training for further education. The present publication is the major outcome of the first phase of the project, which aimed at the production of a general overview of the <b>accreditation</b> <b>procedures</b> and instruments in the partner countries. To this end, national case studies concerning the accreditation of vocational learning outcomes in Austria, Finland, France, Germany and Ireland have been carried out by the project partners. In order to allow for comparison between the different national approaches a common analytical framework was adopted. The criteria focus especially on the type of recognition (individual vs. blanket recognition) and the methodology of the assessment tools or instruments used.

A site visit committee consisting of three members evaluates the program based on a self-assessment report written by {{the program and the}} experiences and observations of the site visit committee during the site visit. A procedure for accreditation has been developed. The instructions for health informatics programs have been written and a checklist for the site visit committee members is available. In total six subjects are considered, each one consisting of one or more facets. Each facet is judged using its corresponding criterion. Five health informatics programs volunteered. One health informatics program in Finland has already been visited and a report has been produced by the site visit committee. The next site visits are in June and July 2012. The site visit in Finland showed that English summaries of master theses are not enough to get a first impression of the methods used in the thesis. A table of contents is also needed.
