Selection for nitrate reductase (NR) and/or kanamycin (Km) resistance resulted {{in the production of}} three groups of plants (NR+, NR+, KmR, and NR-KmR). Cytological analysis of some hybrid regenerants showed the presence of numerous tobacco chromosomes and chromosome fragments, besides a polyploid N. plumbaginifolia genome (tetra or hexaploid). All the regenerants tested were male sterile but some of them could be backcrossed to the recipient partner. In a second experiment, somatic and highly <b>asymmetric</b> nuclear <b>hybrids</b> were obtained after fusion of mesophyll protoplasts from the universal hybridizer of N. plumbaginifolia with suspension protoplasts of a tumor line of N. tabacum. Selection resulted in two types of colonies: nonregenerating hybrid calli turned out to be true somatic hybrids, while cytological analysis of regenerants obtained on morphogenic calli did not show any presence of donor-specific chromosomes. Forty percent of the hybrid regenerants were completely fertile, while the others could only be backcrossed to the recipient N. plumbaginifolia. Since the gene we selected for is not yet cloned, {{we were not able to}} demonstrate the transfer of genetic material at the molecular level. However, since no reversion frequency for the nitrate reductase mutant is known, and due to a detailed cytological knowledge of both fusion partners, we feel confident in speculating that intergenomic recombination between N. plumbaginifolia and N. tabacum has occurred. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.

To overcome the limitation of semiconductors current and voltage ratings in high power applications, series and parallel connection of switches is often considered an effective solution. In addition, stepped waveform in the output of inverter has better harmonic spectrum than 2 -level waveform in low switching frequencies. So, in recent years multilevel inverters have gained great interest in industry. Among the different solutions available for multilevel converters, the asymmetric topologies allow to generate more voltage levels with less number of semiconductors and thus increase of output performance and system reliability. For these reasons, this kind of topology has attracted a lot of attention both from the customers and from the manufacturers. Application of appropriate semiconductor switches in the different cells of the inverter leads to increase of inverter efficiency. This inverter is typically known as hybrid inverter. In this work, different topologies of multilevel inverters consisting cascaded symmetric, diode-clamped, flying-capacitor, and <b>hybrid</b> <b>asymmetric</b> are investigated.
