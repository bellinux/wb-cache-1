5000|$|<b>Antiroll</b> <b>tanks</b> are tanks fitted onto {{ships in}} order to improve their {{response}} to [...] motion. <b>Antiroll</b> <b>tanks</b> are tanks within the vessel fitted with baffles intended to slow the rate of water transfer from the port side of the tank to the starboard side. The tank is designed such that a larger amount of water is trapped on the higher side of the vessel. This is intended to have an effect completely opposite to that of the free surface effect. They can be broadly classified into active and passive <b>antiroll</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{methods for}} both passive and active motion {{stabilization}} {{used in some}} designs. They include static hull features such as skegs and bilge keels, or active mechanical devices like counterweights, <b>antiroll</b> <b>tanks</b> and stabilizers.|$|R
40|$|Ship deck motions are {{considered}} {{in terms of}} the landing/takeoff of V/STOL aircraft from small ships. Fluctuations in the air turbulence shed by the ship's superstructures, wind direction and velocity, and wind turbulence loads on the aircraft are among the factors discussed. Roll stabilization using <b>antiroll</b> <b>tanks,</b> fins, and rudders is covered...|$|R

5|$|The {{ships of}} the San Giorgio class were {{designed}} as improved {{versions of the}} Pisa-class design. San Marcos design featured several new innovations that differentiated her from her sister ship San Giorgio. San Marco was given the first steam turbines fitted in a large Italian ship {{and she was the}} first turbine-powered ship in any navy to have four shafts, the first with a gyroscopic compass, the first with <b>antiroll</b> <b>tanks,</b> and the first not to use wood in any way.|$|R
5000|$|Manned by a {{civilian}} crew and carrying 15 {{scientists from the}} Naval Oceanographic Office, James M. Gilliss {{was the first of}} a new class of oceanographic ships to be operated by the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS). In addition to the latest in oceanographic and meteorological equipment, she also possessed unusual design features, including special <b>antiroll</b> <b>tanks</b> for stability and a retractable bow propulsion propeller. As a mobile, floating research laboratory, she was capable of carrying out experiments in sound transmission, underwater life, and ocean floor characteristics, thus enabling her to help continue the Navy's lead in the exploration and understanding of [...] "inner space." ...|$|R
500|$|The San Giorgio {{class was}} ordered almost {{immediately}} after the preceding [...] ships, and was an improved version of that design. The forecastle was extended to improve seaworthiness, turret armor was increased, habitability was improved and the propulsion machinery was redistributed. San Marco was given the first steam turbines fitted in a large Italian ship for comparative purposes with San Giorgio, which retained the traditional vertical triple-expansion steam engines (VTE). San Marco was a very innovative ship as {{she was the first}} turbine-powered ship in any navy to have four propeller shafts, the first with a gyroscopic compass, the first with <b>antiroll</b> <b>tanks,</b> and the first not to use wood in any way.|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of the ship roll motions {{is a very important}} aim in the pleasure craft design because of its strong influence on the comfort onboard. Fin stabilizers have been used to reduce the roll motion of ships in underway condition for years, since they generate the stabilizing moment working as a couple of foils with opposite angle of attack i. e. a symmetrical foil in an incoming flow generates a lift that is proportional to the square of the velocity and to its angle of attack, their effects at low and null speed are almost nil. For this reason anti-roll tanks have been adopted on many ships to reduce the roll at anchor but with serious drawbacks. The tanks have to be made quite large and have to be installed in a proper position to produce a considerable roll damping so it has a really strong influence on the internal arrangement. In the last 15 years, pulled by the growing market of the pleasure craft and the request of higher comfort standards, different stabilizing systems have been studied. The gyro stabilizers and the Zero Speed Fin are the most used, both of them are able to produce a stabilizing effect at zero speed and even in underway condition, the main differences between them are that the first one takes more time to be turned on and off, on the other hand the fins increase the hull resistance and can be damaged in collision with some floating object. The working principle of the gyroscope is well known on the contrary the principle behind the zero speed stabilizers, explained as ‘‘paddle’’ Ooms 2002 [1], has not been deeply investigated yet. In literature it is possible to find analytical hydrodynamic models and 2 D CFD simulations [2], and other works in which fins are compared with <b>antiroll</b> <b>tanks</b> and their use in anchored conditions is discussed [3, 4] while CFD simulations of three dimensional model or model tests are not present. This research has the objective to find out the correct setting to realize an analysis of a zero speed fin with the commercial CFD code Star-CCM+, and later, using this model, to gain a deep understanding of the fluid dynamical behaviour...|$|R
