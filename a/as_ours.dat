25|$|This {{novel is}} based on the idea of {{traveling}} to another time period. However, it is not about basic time travel. The author {{is quick to point out}} that the traditional idea of time travel is not possible. Instead, the author uses quantum mechanics to suggest that other universes exist at the same time <b>as</b> <b>ours,</b> each existing in another time and place.|$|E
25|$|The protein or {{membrane}} environment {{could respond}} to an external field {{in a number of}} different ways. Field induced dipoles, reorientation of permanent dipoles, protonation and deprotonation of protein residues, larger scale reorganization of ionized side-chains and water molecules, both within the interior and on the surface of the protein, are all examples of how complicated the assignment of permittivity is. In MD simulations, where all the charges, dipoles, and field induced atomic dipoles are treated explicitly then it is suggested that a dielectric value of 1 is appropriate. However, in reduced-particle ion simulation programs, such <b>as</b> <b>ours,</b> where the protein, membrane, and water are continuum backgrounds and treated implicitly, and on top of that, the ion motion takes place on the same time-scale as the protein’s response to its presence, it is very difficult to assign the dielectric coefficients. In fact, changing the dielectric coefficients could easily alter the channel characteristics, such as ion permeation and selectivity The assignment of dielectric coefficient for water is another key issue. The water molecules inside ion channels could be very ordered due to tapered size of the pore, which is often lined with highly charged residues, or hydrogen bond formation between water molecules and protein. As a result, the dielectric constant of water inside an ion channel could be quite different from the value under bulk conditions. To make the matter even more complicated, the dielectric coefficients of water inside nanopores is not necessarily an isotropic scalar value, but an anisotropic tensor having different values in different directions.|$|E
500|$|The {{firm was}} {{attacked}} by journalists and politicians throughout its existence, in part for these monopolistic methods, giving momentum to the antitrust movement. By 1880, according to the New York World, Standard Oil was [...] "the most cruel, impudent, pitiless, and grasping monopoly that ever fastened upon a country". To critics Rockefeller replied, [...] "In a business so large <b>as</b> <b>ours...</b> some things {{are likely to be}} done which we cannot approve.

500|$|Historian John E. Ferling {{attributes}} Adams' defeat to five factors: {{the stronger}} {{organization of the}} Democratic–Republicans; Federalist disunity; the controversy surrounding the Alien and Sedition Acts; the popularity of Jefferson in the south; and, the effective politicking of Aaron Burr in New York, where the State Legislature shifted from Federalist to Democratic–Republican {{on the basis of}} a few wards in New York City controlled by Burr's political machine. Analyzing the causes of the party's trouncing, Adams wrote, [...] "No party that ever existed knew itself so little or so vainly overrated its own influence and popularity <b>as</b> <b>ours.</b> None ever understood so ill the causes of its own power, or so wantonly destroyed them." ...|$|E
500|$|Lê Duẩn {{departed}} from Marxist/Leninist orthodoxy {{when it came}} to practical policy and stated that the country had to [...] "carry out agricultural cooperation immediately, even before having built large industry." [...] While he acknowledged that his view was heresy, Lê Duẩn insisted that Vietnam was in a unique situation; [...] "It seems that no country so far in history has been in a situation such <b>as</b> <b>ours.</b> We must lead the peasantry and agriculture immediately to socialism, without waiting for a developed industry, though we know very well that without the strong impact of industry, agriculture cannot achieve large-scale production and new relations of agriculture cannot be consolidated... To proceed from small-scale production to large-scale production is a new one." [...] According to Lê Duẩn the key to socialism was not mechanisation and industrialisation, but a new division of labour. He also believed that cooperatives {{did not need to be}} autarkic, but rather [...] "organically connected, through the process of production itself, with other cooperatives and with the state economic sector." [...] Vietnam could achieve this through state intervention and control. He saw the economy as one whole directed by the state and not many parts intertwined.|$|E
500|$|The Years of Rice and Salt {{belongs to}} the {{alternate}} history subgenre of speculative fiction. The novel starts {{at the point of}} divergence with Timur turning his army away from Europe where the Black Death killed 99% of Europe's population, instead of a third. Robinson explores world history from that point in AD 1405 (807 AH) to about AD 2045 (1467 AH) with Mughal Emperor Akbar being the last character with a real-world counterpart. Robinson's take on alternate history is that because it [...] "is set in the same lawful universe <b>as</b> <b>ours,</b> its science must be the same [...] because its people have the same basic human needs, their societies resemble ours." [...] Therefore, despite the difference in who specifically is there, [...] "the great majority of humanity [...] doing their work, and that work would tend to forge along at a certain pace as people tried to solve the problems of making themselves more comfortable in this world." [...] While most alternate histories use the Great Man theory of history, focusing on leaders, wars, and big events, Robinson writes more about social history, similar to the Annales School of history theory and Marxist historiography, focusing on the lives of ordinary people living in their time and place. This is reflected in the title of the novel, The Years of Rice and Salt, which refers to the everyday chores of raising a family, often performed by women, despite the politics and wars of men. Reviewers noted this allows for the [...] "history [...] experienced by readers on a human scale" [...] and [...] "an implicit but thorough rebuke to the kind of war-gaming determinism that most alternate histories embody." [...] The novel has characters that explore subjects like philosophy, theology, history, and scientific theory.|$|E

"The current {{practice}} of holding detainees or prisoners indefinitely, without affording them basic due process rights, {{has been widely}} criticized {{in this country and}} throughout the world.

2500|$|However, {{because of}} this hope we hold, we may never exist harmoniously in a society such <b>as</b> <b>ours</b> {{which is based on}} sin. When {{following}} the Theology of Hope, a Christian should find hope in the future but also experience much discontentment with the way the world is now, corrupt and full of sin. Sin bases itself in hopelessness, which can take on two forms: presumption and despair. [...] "Presumption is a premature, selfwilled anticipation of the fulfillment of what we hope for from God. Despair is the premature, arbitrary anticipation of the non-fulfillment of what we hope for from God." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was at once}} {{evident to}} Rivers that [...] "the names applied to {{the various forms of}} blood {{relationship}} did not correspond to those used by Europeans, but belonged to what is known as a 'classificatory system'; a man's 'brothers' or 'sisters' might include individuals we should call cousins and the key to this nomenclature {{is to be found in}} forms of social organisation especially in varieties of the institution of marriage." [...] Rivers found that relationship terms were used to imply definite duties, privileges and mutual restrictions in conduct, rather than being biologically based <b>as</b> <b>ours</b> are. As Head puts it: [...] "all these facts were clearly demonstrable by the genealogical method, a triumphant generalisation which has revolutionised ethnology." ...|$|E

On April 27, 1968, King spoke at an anti-war demonstration in Central Park in place of her husband.

Peres' statement that [...] "from such a small country <b>as</b> <b>ours</b> it is almost amazing, that we are buying up Manhattan, Hungary, Romania and Poland" [...] inflicted a heated debate in the Hungarian public discourse and the Israeli diplomacy had to explain the controversial words several times.|$|E
