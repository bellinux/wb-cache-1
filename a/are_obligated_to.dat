25|$|According to the Bayit Chadash, the Sefer Agudah, {{and arguably}} the Maharil, {{both men and}} women <b>are</b> <b>obligated</b> <b>to</b> fast. This is based upon the Midrash, which states that {{both men and women}} among the firstborn Egyptians perished in the plague (Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, 7; Exodus Rabbah, 18:3). Following a {{precedent}} common in Jewish commemorative rituals, the above authorities ruled that all those who were miraculously saved should participate in commemoration (see also Pesachim 108b). Since both men and women died from the plague, all firstborn Jewish men and women alive at that time are considered to have been miraculously saved. The Rema and the Vilna Gaon rule that women are exempt from the fast. As the Book of Exodus (13:12–15) mentions the biblical commandment of Redemption of the Firstborn as commemorative of the salvation of Jewish firstborns in Egypt, and as this command only applies to firstborn males, the Rema and the Vilna Gaon rule similarly that only males <b>are</b> <b>obligated</b> <b>to</b> fast. Common practice is that only males fast.|$|E

If the Bible does not say these things, we need to fear God and be frightened of adding to His Word.|$|E

25|$|This {{traditional}} prominence {{is rooted}} in the Babylonian Talmud’s description of how to attain atonement following the destruction of the Temple. According to Talmud tractate Yoma, {{in the absence of a}} Temple, Jews <b>are</b> <b>obligated</b> <b>to</b> study the High Priest’s ritual on Yom Kippur, and this study helps achieve atonement for those who are unable to benefit from its actual performance. In Orthodox Judaism, accordingly, studying the Temple ritual on Yom Kippur represents a positive rabbinically ordained obligation which Jews seeking atonement are required to fulfill.|$|E
25|$|According to the Talmud {{women are}} {{generally}} exempted from obligations {{that have to}} be performed at a certain time. Orthodox authorities have generally interpreted this exemption due to women's higher spiritual level and therefore a lack of need to connect to God at specific times, since they are always connected to God. In accordance with the general exemption from time-bound obligations, most Orthodox authorities have exempted women from performing evening prayers (Maariv), but most believe that women <b>are</b> <b>obligated</b> <b>to</b> pray Shacharit and Mincha, the morning and afternoon prayers, respectively, when possible.|$|E
