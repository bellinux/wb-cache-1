40|$|Invasive species {{management}} requires {{allocation of}} limited resources towards the proactive mitigation of those species that could elicit the highest ecological impacts. However, we lack predictive capacity {{with respect to}} the identities and degree of ecological impacts of invasive species. Here, we combine the relative per capita effects and relative field abundances of invader as compared to native species into a new metric, “Relative Impact Potential” (RIP), and test whether this metric can reliably predict high impact invaders. This metric tests the impact of invaders relative to the baseline impacts of natives on the broader ecological community. We first derived the functional responses (i. e. per capita effects) of two ecologically damaging invasive fish species in Europe, the Ponto-Caspian round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and <b>Asian</b> <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> (Pseudorasbora parva), and their native trophic analogues, the bullhead (Cottus gobio; also C. bairdi) and bitterling (Rhodeus amarus), towards several prey species. This establishes the existence and relative strengths of the predator-prey relationships. Then, we derived ecologically comparable field abundance estimates of the invader and native fish from surveys and literature. This establishes the multipliers for the above per capita effects. Despite both predators having known severe detrimental field impacts, their functional responses alone were of modest predictive power in this regard; however, incorporation of their abundances relative to natives into the RIP metric gave high predictive power. We present invader/native RIP biplots that provide an intuitive visualisation of comparisons among the invasive and native species, reflecting the known broad ecological impacts of the invaders. Thus, we provide a mechanistic understanding of invasive species impacts and a predictive tool for use by practitioners, for example, in risk assessments...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePredicting regions at {{risk from}} {{introductions}} of non-native species and the subsequent invasions is a fundamental aspect of horizon scanning activities that enable {{the development of more}} effective preventative actions and planning of management measures. The <b>Asian</b> cyprinid fish <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> Pseudorasbora parva has proved highly invasive across Europe since its introduction in the 1960 s. In addition to direct negative impacts on native fish populations, P. parva has potential for further damage through transmission of an emergent infectious disease, known to cause mortality in other species. To quantify its invasion risk, in regions where it has yet to be introduced, we trained 900 ecological niche models and constructed an Ensemble Model predicting suitability, then integrated a proxy for introduction likelihood. This revealed high potential for P. parva to invade regions well beyond its current invasive range. These included areas in all modelled continents, with several hotspots of climatic suitability and risk of introduction. We believe that these methods are easily adapted for a variety of other invasive species and that such risk maps could be used by policy-makers and managers in hotspots to formulate increased surveillance and early-warning systems that aim to prevent introductions and subsequent invasions...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{reproductive}} chemical cues is widespread amongst fishes. However, the most understood sex pheromone systems derive from species that employ a scramble spawning reproductive strategy. This thesis investigated {{for the first}} time the use {{of reproductive}} chemical communication in <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> Pseudorasbora parva (Temminck & Schlegel) and sunbleak Leucaspius delineates (Heckel) that use two different forms of a male nest guarding reproductive strategy. In <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon,</b> approximately a third of reproductive females adopted a body posture in response to reproductive male conditioned water advertising high receptivity to potential mates. Electro-Olfactory Gram recordings of reproductive male and female <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> revealed a high magnitude response to reproductive male and female odours. In addition, both <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> and sunbleak reproductive females responded to chemicals cues derived from conspecific reproductive males by an increase in swimming behaviour. In contrast to male <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon,</b> reproductive male sunbleak responded to chemical cues from reproductive conspecific males and females. Active compounds were isolated from reproductive male <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> conditioned water by two different methods solid phase extraction (C- 18 cartridges) and using a freeze drier. The eluate was subsequently separated using High Performance Liquid Chromatography into retention time fractions. An active fraction was identified using a bioassay guided separation.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the Diploma Thesis was to {{summarize}} all the data published either from scientific papers or collected during the experiments, relating {{to the possibility of}} using <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> as fish food. The main part is composed of the results and conclusions obtained from the experiments conducted in the model recirculation system, under controlled conditions. The experiments were focused on the feed preferences of the pikeperch (Sander lucioperca), for the given size category of the <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> (Pseudorasbora parva), stimulation of the food intake of the pikeperch in the conditions with different amounts of <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon,</b> and on the intraspecific competition for food in cases with different numbers of the stocked pikeperch.

40|$|<b>Topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon,</b> Pseudorasbora parva is {{the most}} common {{invasive}} fish in Europe, which can compete with the juveniles of valuable commercial fishes. The goal of this work is to study the diet of <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> and trophic relationships with some native fishes inhabiting the littoral zone of the Dniprodzerzhynsk reservoir. The obtained relatively low values of diet overlaps between <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> and other co-occurring cyprinids such as juvenile roach, Rutilus rutilus; silver bream, Blicca bjoerkna; rudd, Scardinius erythrophthalmus; Prussian carp, Carassius gibelio and bleak, Abramis brama, indicate {{that it is not a}} serious food competitor for them, especially commercially valuable ones. On the contrary, high diet overlaps were observed among some native cyprinids such as juvenile roach, silver bream, rudd, and bleak. The major prey items of <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> were Chydorus sphaericus and chironomids, whereas other cyprinids selected Bosmina spp. This peculiarity may be due to different vertical distributions of these fish in the littoral zone of the reservoir, where <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> inhabit near-bottom water layers, where they preyed on near-bottom and benthic zooplankters and chironomids, while juvenile roach, silver bream, rudd, and juvenile and adult bleak live in higher water layers, where they preyed on pelagic zooplankton...|$|R
40|$|The <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> is an {{invasive}} {{species of the}} European fish fauna that causes problems {{not only as a}} competitor of native fishes in natural waters but also generates damages in pond fish farming. The behaviour of <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> has already been studied from a number of aspects, however, complex investigations on the habitat use of the species in invaded regions were not carried out yet.

Knowledge and understanding of the species' interactions with the environment and with native fish are important to stop and prevent the further spread of the species. Creating species distribution models is a useful technique to determine which factors influence the occurrence and abundance of a species. We applied three different modelling techniques: general additive models, random forests and fuzzy habitat suitability modelling (FHSM) to assess the habitat suitability of <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon.</b> The former two techniques indicated that the abundance of native fish (i. e. biotic variables) was more important than environmental variables when determining the abundance of <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> in Flanders (Belgium). Bitterling (Rhodeus amarus), stone loach (Barbatula barbatula), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and predator abundance were selected as the most important biotic variables and implemented in the FHSM to investigate species interactions. Depending on the preferred food source and spawning behaviour, either coexistence or interspecific competition can occur with bitterling, stone loach and three-spined stickleback.

40|$|Non-native species invasions {{threaten}} the structure, function and biodiversity of ecosystems worldwide, {{and those of}} non-native fishes pose amongst the greatest threats to inland waters of the U.

This PhD investigated the establishment, dispersal and ecological implications of introducing the two non-native fish species, sunbleak Leucaspius delineatus (Heckel, 1843) and <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> Pseudorasbora parva (Temminck and Schlegel, 1842) to inland waters of England. The introduction and initial dispersal of both species {{can be attributed to}} the commercial fish trade. Species-specific variability of life history, growth and morphological traits was examined in sunbleak (12 sites) and <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> (3 sites) to assess their role in establishment success. The drift dynamics, i. e. timing and intensity (propagule pressure), of sunbleak and <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> were assessed for source populations to determine dispersal potential. Potential risks for native species posed by these two alien cyprinids were assessed with respect to the parasite fauna and overlaps in resource use. For sunbleak, these were also examined in terms of social integration of this species into a native fish assemblage. Biological resistance to <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> invasion was evaluated by stomach flushing and gut content analysis of native piscivorous fishes. Inter-population variability in life histories and morphological characters were observed in both sunbleak and <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon.</b> Populations of both species matured at small body sizes and between the ages 1 and 2. The fish were of good body condition and exhibited high reproductive investment. In both species, dispersal from source waters followed a diel pattern, with higher rates at night than during the day (e. g. maximum drift densities during May of 2004 and 2005 : 9 - 10 sunbleak per 1000 m - 3 at about 23 : 00 hrs; 40 - 52 <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> per 1000 m - 3 at about 05 : 00 hrs). Downstream of one source population, microhabitat use of <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> was found to overlap with native species (brown trout Salmo trutta L., European chub Leuciscus cephalus (L.), bullhead Cottus gobio L., stoneloach Barbatula barbatula (L.); both brown trout and chub were observed to prey on <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon.</b> However, predation intensity may be density-dependent and of insufficient level to impede <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> establishment, which was facilitated in the receiving stream by the consistent propagule pressure from on-line source populations. Sunbleak diet and microhabitat use also overlapped with native species (roach Rutilus rutilus (L.) and common bream Abramis brama (L.)) as young larvae, but this decreased with age. Social network analysis of sunbleak-native species interactions revealed that sunbleak creates significantly stronger social bonds with the native species than do natives amongst themselves. No macro-parasites were found in <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon,</b> but two ‘Category II’ non-native parasites Neoergasilus japonicus (Harada, 1930) and Ergasilus briani (Markewitsch, 1932) were found in some populations of sunbleak. The potential for sunbleak to spread beyond their current distribution in England and the species’ social integration behaviour may facilitate the dispersal of these parasites, which may spread faster among communities invaded by sunbleak than in those where this non-native species is absent. The results of this PhD study are discussed within their wider context and their relevance to non-native species risk analysis and management.

An invasive species of European concern is the <b>Asian</b> cyprinid fish, <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> (Pseudorasbora parva). Here, eDNA analyses were applied at a commercial angling venue in southern England to inform operations aiming to eradicate P. parva, which had only ever been observed {{in one of the}} venue's seven unconnected angling ponds. Eradication of P. parva was initially attempted by repeated depletion of the population using fish traps (crayfish traps fitted with 5  mm mesh netting) and the introduction of native predators over a 4 -year period. The very low number of P. parva captured following these eradication efforts suggested a possible population crash. Conventional PCR analysis of water samples using species-specific primers was applied to all seven ponds to confirm that P. parva was present in only one pond, that the eradication attempt had indeed failed and that the species' distribution in the pond appeared to be restricted to three bankside locations. The continued presence of P. parva at these locations was confirmed by subsequent trapping. Water samples from an adjacent, unconnected stream were also analysed using the eDNA methodology, but no DNA of P. parva was detected. The results suggest that further management action to eradicate P. parva be focused on the pond shown to contain the isolated P. parva population and thereby eliminate the risk of further dispersal. This study is the first to apply eDNA analysis to assess the efficacy of an eradication attempt and to provide evidence that the species was unlikely to be present in the other ponds, thus reducing the resources needed to control the species...|$|R

We have applied all the available information on S. destruens and host-range to an established framework for risk-assessing non-native parasites to evaluate the risks posed by S. destruens and discuss the next steps to manage and prevent disease emergence of this generalist parasite...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the first phase}} {{in the development and}} validation of a simple and reliable environmental (e) DNA method using conventional PCR to detect four species of non-native freshwater fish: pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus, sunbleak Leucaspius delineatus, fathead minnow Pimephales promelas and <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> Pseudorasbora parva. The efficacy of the approach was demonstrated in indoor tank (44 l) trials in which all four species were detected within 24 h. Validation was through two field trials, in which L. gibbosus was detected 6 - 12 h after its introduction into outdoor experimental ponds and P. parva was successfully detected in disused fish rearing ponds where the species was known to exist. Thus, the filtration of small (30 ml) volumes of pond water was sufficient to capture fish eDNA and the approach emphasised the importance of taking multiple water samples of sufficient spatial coverage for detecting species of random or patchy distribution...|$|R
40|$|Fourteen {{non-indigenous}} {{fish species}} have been successfully introduced to the wild within the territory of Flanders; nine are considered naturalized. Most of the introductions occurred prior to 1950, with six species introduced since then. This paper reviews the available, hitherto scattered, information (including ‘grey literature’) on these 14 non-indigenous fish species introductions, and evaluates a decade of data from fisheries surveys to assess the recent development of these non-indigenous populations. Gibel carp Carassius gibelio and <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> Pseudorasbora parva are the most widespread of the non-indigenous species in Flemish waters, and both continue to expand their ranges. A reduction in range has been observed in brown bullhead Ameiurus nebulosus only. A case is presented for not including European catfish Silurus glanis, sunbleak Leucaspius delineatus and European bullhead Cottus gobio {{on the list of}} non-indigenous freshwater fishes in Flanders. Also discussed are non-indigenous fish species that are likely to colonize Flanders inland waters in the near future...|$|R
40|$|In 2010 in the City of Łódź, Central Poland, electrofishing {{was carried}} out at 12 sites in the Miazga, Bzura, Sokołówka and Lagiewniczanka Streams in the Vistula system. Eight fish species were recorded, of which two were alien (giebel Carassius gibelio and <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> Pseudorasbora parva) and only two were rheophilic (ide Leuciscus idus and gudgeon Gobio gobio). Roach Rutilus rutilus and three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus {{constituted}} 64 % of all the fish in samples. Stone loach Barbatula barbatula, usually common in other similar streams, was absent. The fish distribution and abundance was significantly determined by the stream regulation. In the Sokołówka electrofishing was conducted earlier at the same six sites in 2002. Seven species were recorded in both terms; in 2010 ide (coming from stocking) was captured instead of the previously recorded crucian carp Carassius carassius. The total fish abundance was over twice lower than in 2002.

40|$|Sphaerothecum destruens is a {{significant}} intracellular parasite of fish which has caused disease and mortalities in cultured north American Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. Several hosts for S. destruens have been identified within the Salmonidae family, and the histopathology of the infection can differ between hosts. Recently, S. destruens {{has been associated with}} the most invasive cyprinid species in Europe, <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> Pseudorasbora parva. Accurate disease identification based on thorough descriptions of clinical signs and histopathology in this new range of hosts is thus paramount to support further epizootiological studies. In this study, the associated histopathology of S. destruens infection is described along with its pathogenesis in the endangered cyprinid sunbleak Leucaspius delineatus. Histological examination of 100 L. delineatus in a wild population in the south of England revealed the presence of S. destruens infections, with a prevalence of 5 % with S. destruens, suggesting an over-dispersed distribution within the L. delineatus sample. Clinical signs of the infection were absent, but histological examination revealed the presence of both disseminated and nodular lesions in several organs...|$|R
40|$|Genetic fuzzy {{systems have}} a {{potential}} {{to be applied to}} ecological studies as a tool for species distribution modelling and habitat evaluation. However, no study has focused on how different model formulations affect habitat preference evaluation and performance of the model. The present study therefore aims to assess the effect of model formulations on habitat preference evaluation through the optimization process. We employed a genetic algorithm (GA) -optimized Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model for evaluating habitat preference of <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> (Pseudorasbora parva), a freshwater fish in Japan. The model was trained based on the mean square error (MSE) between composite habitat preference and observed presence-absence, and evaluated using confusion matrix-derived performance measures such as kappa and correctly classified instances (CCI). The present results clearly illustrated the effect of model formulations on habitat preference evaluation, which appeared as different trends in habitat preference curves (HPCs) and the variance. The use of the product equation is recommended in view of model accuracy and consistency in HPCs. Further studies would be necessary for better understanding of model behaviour to different conditions of data such as sample size and prevalence...|$|R
40|$|Public {{perception}} {{is a key}} factor influencing current conservation policy. Therefore, {{it is important to}} determine the influence of the public, end-users and scientists on the prioritisation of conservation issues and the direct implications for policy makers. Here, we assessed public attitudes and the perception of conservation managers to five non-native species in the UK, with these supplemented by those of an ecosystem user, freshwater anglers. We found that threat perception was not influenced by the volume of scientific research or by the actual threats posed by the specific non-native species. Media interest also reflected public perception and vice versa. Anglers were most concerned with perceived threats to their recreational activities but their concerns did not correspond to the greatest demonstrated ecological threat. The perception of conservation managers was an amalgamation of public and angler opinions but was mismatched to quantified ecological risks of the species. As this suggests that invasive species management in the UK is vulnerable to a knowledge gap, researchers must consider the intrinsic characteristics of their study species to determine whether raising public perception will be effective. The case study of the <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> Pseudorasbora parva reveals that media pressure and political debate has greater capacity to ignite policy changes and impact studies on non-native species than scientific evidence alone...|$|R
40|$|Biological invasions {{caused by}} {{accidental}} introductions often result in severe ecological impact. Revealing {{the pattern of}} spread can clarify processes which drive these types of invasions and therefore help mitigate their impact. Here, based on the genetic structure at five microsatellite loci, we reconstructed the invasion history of the <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> (Pseudorasbora parva). This small cyprinid fish was introduced from China in the early 1960 s into countries around the Black Sea, spreading rapidly throughout Europe north, west and southward. Distribution of the genetic variation from 14 European and one Chinese founder population was analysed, revealing possible pathways of spread in Europe. Overall, the distribution of genetic diversity across populations is strongly correlated to the geographic and temporal spread of P. parva across its invasive range. Populations closest to the founder sites had high levels of genetic diversity and little genetic differentiation. Furthermore, a pattern of isolation-by-distance was found, which indicates human-mediated stepping-stone colonisation. The data also indicate that the invasive populations originate from recent admixture of divergent source populations with some recently established populations, although the admixture signal has been dampened by strong genetic drift. These results nevertheless show that despite being a human-mediated invasion, the pattern of spread resembles a natural stepping-stone colonization with a well-defined front of invasion...|$|R
40|$|The diet {{composition}} and fish preference of piscivorous Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) were studied in two fish farm systems in Hungary using spraint (otter faeces) analysis during two wintering periods. The primary food source of otters in both fish farms was fish (97 - 99 % of biomass). The main fish prey was small-sized, below 100 g in weight (96 % in both areas), while fish prey above 500 g comprised only 0. 1 - 0. 4 % of the diet. The {{bulk of the}} otters’ diet consisted of less valued species, especially non-native Prussian carp (Carassius auratus gibelio). Consumption of commercial fish species ranged between 15 % and 31 % of the total diet. Otters preferred fish below 100 g in weight (Ivlev's selectivity index, Ei= 0. 65 – 0. 70), and showed a lesser preference for (or avoided) fish above 100 g in weight (Ei= - 0. 37 – - 1. 00). With regard to species distribution, otters preferred small (below 100 g) grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), zander (Sander lucioperca), pike (Esox lucius), Prussian carp, <b>topmouth</b> <b>gudgeon</b> (Pseudorasbora parva), while they consumed common carp (Cyprinus carpio), the most important commercial species, proportionally to its abundance in the environment (Ei = - 0. 18 – - 0. 29) ...|$|R
