Also in 1973, the musical revue Jacques Brel is <b>Alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>Well</b> <b>and</b> Living in Paris opened in the State Theatre lobby. Expected to run two weeks, the show instead played {{for two and a}} half years. In 1978, Playhouse Square was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecution}} {{was conducted}} by Norman Birkett KC, who could only argue that Nodder had abducted the child. Nodder chose not to testify at this hearing, leaving his defence counsel, led by Maurice Healy, to reiterate Nodder's claims that the girl had spent one night at his Peacehaven home before he had given the child two shillings and instructions {{as to how to}} travel to her aunt's Sheffield home, and that he had not seen her since. Healy further argued that Mona may still be found <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> that and no-one should speculate as to her fate.|$|E

25|$|Nicholas's life passes {{before his}} eyes as he falls. He smashes through a glass roof and lands on a giant air bag. Emergency medical {{technicians}} carefully remove him, and he finds himself in a ballroom full of his friends, family, and every figure involved in his Game; it had been just a game all along. Conrad is <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> explains that he initiated the game to get his brother to embrace life and not to end up like their father. Nicholas bursts into tears, relaxes, and begins to enjoy the party once his shock has dissipated. When he sees that Christine has left the party, he follows her outside to her cab. He asks her to dinner, and she offers to share a coffee with him before her flight takes her to her next game assignment in Australia.|$|E
25|$|After {{nearly two}} months, {{at the end}} of November, the kidnappers {{contacted}} Granger, promising that the hostages were <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> demanding a ransom of 10 million dollars. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office had already announced that it was Her Majesty's Government's policy not to pay ransoms, but Granger agreed to find the money. According to the 2005 article in Kommersant, the management of state-owned telecommunications company Chechentelekom determined that the engineers were {{in the hands of the}} rogue Chechen commander and reputed organized crime figure Arbi Barayev; during the war with Russia, Barayev abducted a group of 29 Russian engineers near Grozny and later exchanged them for a large sum of money. According to the rumors, the company even took one of Barayev's deputies hostage and proposed exchanging him for the foreigners, yet Barayev declined and continued in demanding $10m for their release.|$|E
25|$|Pearce-Stevenson's {{mobile phone}} was used until mid-2011, {{communicating}} via text messages {{to give her}} family and friends the impression she was <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> to appeal for money. Her bank account was accessed until at least 2012 at locations in four states and territories. Over $90,000 was stolen through the account, including Centrelink family payments and other proceeds of fraud. A woman in a wheelchair, accompanied by a man, impersonated Pearce-Stevenson to staff at a credit union in June 2010 using her identity documents. Another woman impersonated her at a Centrelink office in South Australia the same year, using identity documents for Pearce-Stevenson and her daughter Khandalyce. The woman had her leg amputated {{as a result of a}} car rollover in 2008 in which Holdom was driving on the Stuart Highway north of Marla. Two of her children were killed in the crash.

25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} eat or drink. Her once lovely face turned sallow {{and she began to}} shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, {{to let them know that}} he was still <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live for the rest of his life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would remind him that there were plenty of young English women in the colonies just looking for a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E

One well-known fable among Greek seamen involves a solitary mermaid who would grasp a ship's prow during a storm and ask the captain [...] "Is King Alexander alive?" [...] The correct answer is [...] "He is <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> rules the world!" [...] causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm.

500|$|The mystery writer J.A. Jance {{wrote in}} the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Yes, it's {{a bit of a}} shock to {{discover}} that some of the TV series' characters who died last season or the season before are back among the living between the covers of Lindsay's new book. Rita, Dexter's long-suffering wife who died a terrible death in a bathtub in last year's season finale, is <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>and</b> having a baby in Dexter Is Delicious. But my advice to readers is this: Don't quibble. Get over it. After all, fiction is an alternate universe to begin with, and Lindsay's dark, comedic fiction is an alternate universe once removed. Patrick McCann and Colin Wrinn were very upset about her death in Season 4 of the hit TV show, Dexter, but Colin Whelan did not care for her." ...|$|E

Bower has said that she expects this storyline to come under fire, saying [...] "I do believe homophobia is still <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> I {{have no doubt that}} we will get complaints about it". Australian LGBT website SameSame said the story had attracted attention from some media commentators, who called it [...] "an obvious ratings grab and an attempt to out-gay rival soap, Home and Away". However, script producer, Emma Steele defended the storyline and said {{that it is not a}} [...] "ploy to grab ratings". Steele said that she is [...] "particularly proud" [...] of the way Chris's storyline had been handled and she added [...] "It was something we wanted to do for a while because it's a story that affects so many people and in so many different ways. It wasn't just Chris's story. I think it's interesting to see how [...] affected his friends and his relationships with them too".|$|E

As Rintarō sends a text message about the incident to his friend, Itaru [...] "Daru" [...] Hashida, he experiences a strange phenomenon and the people around him disappear, with no-one else noticing anything had changed. After later running into Kurisu, who is strangely <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well,</b> <b>and</b> discovering the message he had sent to Itaru had arrived a week before he sent it, Rintarō soon deduces that the 'Mobile Microwave' he and his friends had been developing is, in fact, a time machine capable of sending text messages to the past. He and his friends soon learn that SERN, an organization that has been researching time travel for some time, has actually succeeded in sending humans into the past although they seem to have all resulted in the test subjects' deaths. Rintarō begins experimenting with , which begin to cause major differences in the timeline. Kurisu also manages to create a device to send a person's memories through the microwave, allowing that person to effectively leap into the past.|$|E

500|$|Bowie {{moved to}} the US in 1974, {{initially}} staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles. Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, {{was the product of}} two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits [...] "Rebel Rebel" [...] and [...] "Diamond Dogs", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled [...] "David Bowie Is <b>Alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>Well</b> <b>and</b> Living Only in Theory". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's [...] "Knock on Wood". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul.|$|E
