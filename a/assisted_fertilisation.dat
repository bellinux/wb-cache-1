40|$|This study {{examines}} the issue regarding three reproductive aspects {{in relation to}} women’s right to make own decisions regarding her life, body and reproductive health. The aspects include abortion, <b>assisted</b> <b>fertilisation</b> and surrogacy. In addition, this study investigates if the perception of liberty, in relation to laws and regulation of the female body and the right and freedom of reproductive health, is rooted in explicit versus implicit liberal feminism or conservative feminism. By using idea analysis, this investigation aims to distinguish the ideas behind the regulation of the three aspects. The {{results of the study}} shows that explicit and implicit liberal and conservative ideas from a feminist perspective occurs in the distinct aspects. The study concludes that women have been given liberty and the right to make own decisions regarding her body and reproductive health when it comes to abortion, and also in great extent when it comes to <b>assisted</b> <b>fertilisation.</b> However, in the aspect of surrogacy, women has continuously been denied these decision-making rights regarding her own body...|$|E
40|$|The article {{analyses}} sociological {{research on}} {{lesbian and gay}} parenthood conducted in Italy over the past 30 years. By focusing on the typologies of the homosexual households {{of the participants in}} research projects, this work discusses how empirical academic and non-academic research has depicted same-sex families with children in the Italian context. An initial mainstream inattention towards lesbian and gay parents by sociological research {{at the beginning of the}} Nineties gave way to a particular interest in that experience, focusing on the newest form of homosexual parenthood defined as same-sex couples who are able to access <b>assisted</b> <b>fertilisation</b> technology and surrogacy. The new pattern can be said to have overshadowed the experience of homosexual parents whose children were conceived within heterosexual relationships. This simplification concerns to th...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe last 10 {{years has}} {{witnessed}} {{an explosion in}} research into roles of cilia in cystic renal disease. Cilia are membrane-enclosed finger-like projections from the cell, usually on the apical surface or facing into a lumen, duct or airway. Ten years ago, the major recognised functions related to classical “ 9 + 2 ” cilia in the respiratory and reproductive tracts, where co-ordinated beating clears secretions and <b>assists</b> <b>fertilisation</b> respectively. Primary cilia, which have a “ 9 + 0 ” arrangement lacking the central microtubules, were anatomical curiosities but several lines of evidence have implicated them in both true polycystic kidney disease and other cystic renal conditions: ranging from the homology between Caenorhabditis elegans proteins expressed on sensory cilia to mammalian polycystic kidney disease (PKD) 1 and 2 proteins, through the discovery that orpk cystic mice have structurally abnormal cilia to numerous recent studies wherein expression of nearly all cyst-associated proteins {{has been reported in}} the cilia or its basal body. Functional studies implicate primary cilia in mechanosensation, photoreception and chemosensation but it is the first of these which appears most important in polycystic kidney disease: in the simplest model, fluid flow across the apical surface of renal cells bends the cilia and induces calcium influx, and this is perturbed in polycystic kidney disease. Downstream effects include changes in cell differentiation and polarity. Pathways such as hedgehog and Wnt signalling may also be regulated by cilia. These data support important roles for cilia in the pathogenesis of cystic kidney diseases but one must not forget that the classic polycystic kidney disease proteins are expressed in several other locations where they may have equally important roles, such as in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, whilst it is not just aberrant cilia signalling that can lead to de-differentiation, loss of polarity and other characteristic features of polycystic kidney disease. Understanding how cilia fit into the other aspects of polycystic kidney disease biology is the challenge for the next decade. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Polycystic Kidney Disease...|$|R
40|$|Silkworm males produce dimorphic sperm, {{nucleate}} eupyrene {{sperm and}} anucleate apyrene sperm. Apyrene sperm have been speculated {{to have an}} <b>assisting</b> role in <b>fertilisation.</b> However, the coexistence of eupyrene and apyrene sperm in the testis and female reproductive organs has {{made it difficult to}} define the role of apyrene sperm. Polyploid males are highly sterile. Microscopic observation revealed that the elimination of eupyrene nuclei by peristaltic squeezing caused the sterility of polyploids. Heatshock applied to pupae of Daizo males (DH) also induced high sterility {{due to the lack of}} normal apyrene sperm. When eupyrene sperm of sterile DH males and apyrene sperm of sterile polyploid males were mixed by double copulation, a remarkable increase in fertility of the double-mated females was observed. This finding strongly suggests that the apyrene sperm are indispensable in fertilisation of the silkworm and that polyploid apyrene sperm function as a substitute for diploid sperm. We established an experimental system in which we can separate the two types of sperm for further studies on their functions without chemical and/or mechanical treatments...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} experiences {{presented here}} have been realised since 1994 owing to the ‘Conseil Général’ of the North district on the upper beaches of the Flemish dunes owned by the ‘Conservatoire du Littoral’ situated on the Bray-Dunes and Zuydcoote municipalities (France). This experience aims at {{the restoration of the}} habitats on the sea frontline of the border dune. The matter is the space that starts from the annual halo-nitrophilic strip on the upper beach, goes on with the embryo dune and finishes with the quick white dune dominated by the European beachgrass (marram). The requirements of beach cleanness, especially regarding seaside tourism, have led to the destruction of these patrimonial important habitats by the regular and complete mechanical raking of the strand. The first step consisted in limiting this mechanical raking to the rights of sea-side resorts. At the same time, the upper strip of the beach along dunes is managed softly by a selective manual picking up of the biggest trashes. This change of cleaning process rapidly produced the emergence of noticeable habitats that didn’t exist before. It concerns water marks mingled with sand and embryonic dunes with sand couch grass. To a reduced extent, these methods of management lead to a reinforcement of the white dune with marram and sand ryegrass and the white dune which is warmer with marram and sea spurge. Some of these habitats are listed as part of the Guideline ‘Habitat’ and are listed as vulnerable or endangered after the red book of the littoral terrestrial phytocoenoses according to the definitions proposed by the International Union for Nature Preservation. Moreover, the obstacles kept on the upper strip of the beach afford the start of a process of sand accumulation and build the embryonic dune. According to the sedimentary context, this type of operation <b>assists</b> the <b>fertilisation</b> of the upper beach and reduces the retreat phenomenon of the coastline. The cost of operations is much reduced, money is even saved with the reduction of the number of interventions. It was only difficult to convince our partners about modifying their cleaning habits. This successful experience over a 1. 5 km distance of beach, facing preserved dune massifs, shows the large potentialities of spontaneous restoration of these natural environments. The extreme simplicity of this method and its very small cost, except employment, allow us to envisage and adapt it all along the European coastline...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To explore Vietnamese obstetricians' {{experiences}} and {{views on the}} role of obstetric ultrasound in clinical management of complicated pregnancy and in situations where maternal and fetal health interests conflict. Design: Seventeen obstetricians in northern Vietnam were interviewed as part of the CROss-Country Ultrasound Study (CROCUS) project in 2013. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: The participants described ultrasound as a central tool in prenatal care, although they called for increased training and resources to prevent inappropriate management. A prevailing overuse driven by women's request and increased commercialisation was described. Other clinical examinations were seen as being disregarded by women in favour of ultrasound, resulting in missed opportunities for identifying potential pregnancy complications. The use of ultrasound for sex selection purposes raised concern among participants. Visualisation of human features or heartbeat during ultrasound was commonly described as the point where the fetus became regarded as a 'person'. Women were said to prioritise fetal health interests over their own health, particularly if a woman had difficulties becoming pregnant or had undergone <b>assisted</b> <b>fertilisation.</b> The woman's husband and his family were described as having an important role in decision-making in situations of maternal and fetal health conflicts. Conclusions: This study provides insight into issues surrounding ultrasound use in contemporary Vietnam, some of which may be specific to this low-income context. It is clear that ultrasound has become a central tool in prenatal care in Vietnam and that it has also been embraced by women. However, {{there seems to be a}} need to balance women's demands for obstetric ultrasound with better recognition of the valuable contribution to be made by the full range of clinical examinations in pregnancy, along with a more strategic allocation of resources, that is, use of obstetric ultrasound based on clinical indications. Better regulation of private obstetric practice also appears to be needed. While the root causes of sex selection need to be addressed at societal level, efforts are also required more immediately to find ways to combat the inappropriate use of ultrasound for the purpose of sex selection...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{solubility}} to alpha-chymotrypsin of the zona pellucida (ZP) of human oocytes and polyploid embryos obtained during various clinical procedures of <b>assisted</b> <b>fertilisation</b> (IVF, ICSI, cyropreservation) was evaluated. The {{aim of the}} study was to determine whether changes in ZP solubility occur during such procedures and whether abnormal solubility could be likened to fertilisation failure. Correlation between ZP solubility and cortical granule (CG) density was also studied. The results showed that ZP solubility varied considerably among germinal vesicle or metaphase oocytes obtained from different subjects, but was essentially identical for the oocyte cohort obtained from individual women. On the basis of ZP solubility metaphase oocytes were subdivided into two classes: class I, average ZP dissolution time +/- SE = 24. 1 +/- 0. 9 min, n = 28; and class II, 46. 7 +/- 2. 0 min, n = 13. Prolonged ZP dissolution times of metaphase oocytes were significantly correlated with a low in vitro fertilisation rate in sibling oocytes. The zonae of fertilised eggs (polyploid embryos) showed long solubilisation times (IVF: 45. 3 +/- 3. 4 min, n = 18; ICSI: 48. 9 +/- 2. 7 min, n = 19). ZP solubility of oocytes that failed to fertilise was intermediate between that of class I metaphase oocytes and embryos (unfertilised IVF: 33. 0 +/- 2. 7 min, n = 13; unfertilised ICSI: 43. 0 +/- 2. 4 min, n = 9). A moderate spontaneous ZP hardening occurred when metaphase oocytes were cultured for 24 h. Finally, cryopreservation of unfertilised oocytes caused hardening of their ZP, with dissolution times that were comparable to those found in fertilised eggs (49. 5 +/- 2. 3 min, n = 10). In most cases, an inverse correlation was found between ZP dissolution time and CG density (longer solubilisation times corresponding to lower CG density). ZP hardening caused by cryopreservation, however, was not associated with a significant reduction in CG density in most of the oocytes examined...|$|E
40|$|In the {{industrial}} communities of {{today there is}} reason for concern for the reproductive health of the male, due to decreasing sperm quality and increased incidences of testicular cancer. Norway and Denmark have the highest incidence rates of testicular cancer in the world. There has traditionally been more focus on the maternal contribution for infertility and defects on the offspring compared to the paternal contribution. The genetic constitution of the offspring depends on the integrity of both the paternal (sperm) and the maternal (oocyte) genomes. When {{the integrity of the}} paternal genome is challenged it may lead to serious conditions; Oxidative damage in human sperm correlates with poor sperm quality and reduced fecundity (ability to conceive children). Couples undergoing <b>assisted</b> <b>fertilisation</b> have lower success rates when the father is a smoker, and there is epidemiological data suggesting that children of smoking fathers have a higher risk of developing cancer. One component of cigarette smoke, Benzo(a) pyrene (BaP), induce bulky DNA adducts and also is believed to cause oxidised base damage through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). BaP is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) that has been studied extensively. PAHs are an ubiquitous class of environmental contaminants. We are exposed to PAHs on a daily basis from food, burning of fossil fuels, forest fire, tobacco smoke and diesel exhaust. This exposure to humans qualifies for extensive studies to achieve a good understanding of the possible negative effects on humans. BaP-exposure leads to induction of DNA damage that may be removed via DNA repair. We have previously shown that human testicular cells exhibit poor repair of oxidative damage such as 8 -oxoG, compared to rodents. We, and others, have also shown that male germ cells exhibit a low NER function for several bulky DNA adducts, including BPDE-adducts. These findings indicate that male germ cells, particularly human, may be particularly sensitive for exposure to certain environmental agents and that care should be taken in extrapolating results from rodents to man. The use of repair deficient mice, such as Ogg 1 -/- mice, thus mimics the repair capacity of human male germ cells and allows more relevant analyses of the possible genotoxic effects of environmental agents. In this study a small increase in oxidative damage was observed in the testis at Day 31 following BaP-exposure of Ogg 1 -/- mice. The increased levels of oxidative damage were most evident in haploid round spermatids. Oxidative damage was also induced in the somatic tissues investigated in Ogg 1 -/- mice; at Day 31 a small increase was observed in the liver whereas in the lung a more pronounced induction was detected, with increases at both Day 17 and Day 31 after exposure. No increases in oxidative damage were observed in Ogg 1 +/+ mice in any of the tissues investigated. NADP/NADPH-ratios declined following BaP-exposure in line with the DNA damage levels observed. The expression of Cyp 1 a 1 and Akr 1 a 4 was studied, with induction of Cyp 1 a 1 at Day 1 following exposure in all tissues examined of both genotypes. The constitutive expression of Akr 1 a 4 was significantly higher than Cyp 1 a 1 in all the tissues. Akr 1 a 4 was induced following BaP-exposure in the testis at Day 17 in Ogg 1 +/+ mice whereas the induction on the lung was more apparent, it occurred in both genotypes and took place at earlier time points following BaP-exposure. The decline in NADP/NADPH-ratios and expression levels of Cyp 1 a 1 and Akr 1 a 4 correspond well with the oxidative DNA damage levels observed. We conclude that exposure to BaP in vivo do induce oxidative damage. We provide solid evidence for its induction on the lung whereas the indications that oxidative damage is induced in male germ cells or in the liver are still unresolved...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the issue of infertility and also of the midwife care of a pregnant woman after assisted reproduction. The thesis is divided into the theoretical and the research part. The theoretical part initially defines the terms of infertility, fertility and sterility. Since infertility is always a diagnosis of a couple, the anatomy of a woman and of a man is described. Subsequently, the thesis focuses on the issue of infertility, i. e. assisted reproduction. What are the methods, risks and financing of assisted reproduction? The most common method of assisted reproduction includes Artificial Insemination and In Vitro <b>Fertilisation.</b> <b>Assisted</b> reproduction is a field of medicine that works with sperm, ova and embryos outside the body of a person, {{in order to make the}} woman pregnant. These methods carry certain risks, which are also being described in the thesis. The theoretical part is concluded with a description of the midwife care of a pregnant woman after assisted reproduction, where the midwife education and the term of nursing are emphasised. The aim of the bachelor thesis was to find out the specifics in the care of a pregnant woman after assisted reproduction. Three research questions had been asked: What is the nursing care of a pregnant woman after assisted reproduction like from the viewpoint of pregnant women? What is level of satisfaction of women with the nursing care after assisted reproduction? What are the specifics of experiencing woman's pregnancy after assisted reproduction? A quantitative research survey was used for the research, and data collection was conducted through individual interviews. The basis for the interview were 13 questions prepared in advance, 4 of which were the identifying questions. The research group was formed of eight female respondents. The interviews with women took place in quiet, predetermined places. Prior to the interview, a written request for co-operation was submitted to the respondent. In this request, the respondents were informed about the aim of the research and preservation of anonymity, see Annex 2. The request was signed by all eight female respondents before the actual interview. The interviews were recorded in writing continuously, analysed and divided into the main categories and subcategories, based on the answers of the respondents, using coloured text. The aim was to identify the individual consensus in the opinions of the addressed pregnant women after assisted reproduction. The first category examined the issue of assisted reproduction and was divided into ten subcategories, which dealt with the reasons for going through assisted reproduction, the methods of assisted reproduction, the environment of the centre of assisted reproduction, the personnel of the centre of assisted reproduction, experiencing the assisted reproduction prior to pregnancy, experiencing pregnancy after assisted reproduction, lifestyle during pregnancy after assisted reproduction, complications during pregnancy, opinions on financial burden of the clients and availability of information about assisted reproduction. The results of the research have shown the lifestyle of a woman after assisted reproduction, where the trend of activities was yoga, but at the same time limiting activities and inability to work from the very beginning of the pregnancy. The most common method in infertility treatment is IVF, where there is a high financial burden. The bachelor thesis has shown that women who have undergone assisted reproduction experience fear. Most often it is the fear of miscarriage. And that the infertility is not just a problem of women, but also of men...|$|R
