40|$|A {{major problem}} in {{foundries}} is to select scrap alloys and pure metals {{in order to produce}} at minimum cost alloy of specified composition. We show that such problems, of realistic size, can be solved optimally by mixed-integer programming. Constraints are that the content of the alloys in various metals <b>must</b> <b>be</b> within given ranges and that the selected amount of each scrap <b>alloy</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> either zero or within a given range. The latter "zero or range" constraints can be treated implicitly in a similar way as lower and upper bounds are treated implicitly in bounded variables linear programming.

Their microstructures have to be very stable, both in the wrought and in the welded states. This paper deals with quantitative methods for the design of steel weld metals for elevated temperature applications. A methodology is described for the calculation of complex precipitation reactions over periods extending many tens of years. However, microstructure alone is clearly not enough in the design of alloys. The complex mechanical properties, such as the creep rupture strength, can be estimated quantitatively using the neural network technique which interprets the vast quantities of experimental data that are now available...|$|R

The existence of strong crystallographic textures in such multicrystalline alloys is considered important, since the small angle grain boundaries may be partially responsible for creep threshold stresses. Gleiter (1979) has shown that ideal, low energy boundaries will act as vacancy sources only when the applied stress is greater than a threshold stress, while large angle grain boundaries will emit vacancies at all stress levels. The continued operation of a net vacancy in an ODS <b>alloy</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> avoided, since {{it will lead to}} a localized disruption of the microstructure...|$|R

There are limitations, however, to the successful produc-tion of ternary alloy films. Thus, for instance, in the first place nickel <b>must</b> <b>be</b> capable of being catalytically depos-ited.

Inhibitor Na 2 CrO 4 can eliminate corrosion attack in crevice conditions and in most U-bend tests except for some alloys in which blistering was observed due to adding the inhibitor. Since all these alloys are heat treated high strength materials, ??'phase, MgLi 2 is precipitated along grain boundaries thereby causing intergranular attack.

5000|$|Proper heat {{treating}} requires precise control over temperature, time {{held at a}} certain temperature and cooling rate. With the exception of stress-relieving, tempering, and aging, most heat treatments begin by heating an alloy beyond the upper transformation (A3) temperature. This temperature {{is referred to as}} an [...] "arrest" [...] because at the A3 temperature the metal experiences a period of hysteresis. At this point, all of the heat energy is used to cause the crystal change, so the temperature stops rising for a short time (arrests) and then continues climbing once the change is complete. Therefore, the <b>alloy</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> heated above the critical temperature for a transformation to occur. The alloy will usually be held at this temperature long enough for the heat to completely penetrate the alloy, thereby bringing it into a complete solid solution.|$|R
5000|$|Precipitation {{hardening}} {{relies on}} changes in solid solubility with temperature to produce fine particles of an impurity phase, which impede the movement of dislocations, or defects in a crystal's lattice. Since dislocations are often the dominant carriers of plasticity, this serves to harden the material. The impurities play the same role as the particle substances in particle-reinforced composite materials. Just as the formation of ice in air can produce clouds, snow, or hail, depending upon the thermal history of a given portion of the atmosphere, precipitation in solids can produce many different sizes of particles, which have radically different properties. Unlike ordinary tempering, <b>alloys</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> kept at elevated temperature for hours to allow precipitation to take place. This time delay is called [...] "aging". Solution treatment and aging is sometimes abbreviated [...] "STA" [...] in metals specs and certs.|$|R
