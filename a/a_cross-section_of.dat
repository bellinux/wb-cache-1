5|$|Recent {{atmospheric}} {{mercury contamination}} in outdoor urban air was measured at 0.01–0.02µg/m3. A 2001 study measured mercury levels in 12 indoor sites chosen to represent <b>a</b> <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> building types, locations and ages in the New York area. This study found mercury concentrations significantly elevated over outdoor concentrations, {{at a range}} of 0.0065 – 0.523 μg/m3. The average was 0.069 μg/m3.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by a {{question}} of Hirzebruch on the possible topological types <b>of</b> cusp <b>cross-sections</b> <b>of</b> Hilbert modular varieties, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a manifold M to be diffeomorphic to <b>a</b> cusp <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Hilbert modular variety. Specialized to Hilbert modular surfaces, this proves that every Sol 3 –manifold is diffeo morphic to <b>a</b> cusp <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> (generalized) Hilbert modular surface. We also deduce an obstruction to geometric bounding in this setting. Consequently, there exist Sol 3 –manifolds that cannot arise as <b>a</b> cusp <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 1 –cusped nonsingular Hilbert modular surface. ...|$|R

5|$|The thermal {{analysis}} {{was the first}} done for any casting process. This was done by creating an electrical analog of the thermal system. <b>A</b> <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> the dies were drawn on Teledeltos paper and then thermal loads and cooling patterns were drawn onto the paper. Water lines were represented by magnets of various sizes. The thermal conductivity was represented by the reciprocal of the resistivity of the paper.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} stages of its development, the wing-bud is not {{provided}} with special organs of respiration such as tracheation, as it resembles {{in this respect}} the other portions of the hypodermis {{of which it is}} still a part. It should be noted, however, that the histoblast is developed near a large trachea, <b>a</b> <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> which is shown in, which represents sections of these parts of the first, second, third and fourth instars respectively. At the same time the tracheoles uncoil, and extend in bundles in the forming vein-cavities of the wing-bud. At the molt that marks the beginning of the pupal stadium stage, they become functional. At the same time, the larval tracheoles degenerate; their function having been replaced by the wing tracheae.|$|E

50|$|In {{analogy with}} the <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> solid, the <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> -dimensional body in an -dimensional space is the {{non-empty}} {{intersection of the}} body with a hyperplane (an -dimensional subspace). This concept has sometimes been used to help visualize aspects of higher dimensional spaces. For instance, if a four-dimensional object passed through our three-dimensional space, we would see <b>a</b> three-dimensional <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> the four-dimensional object. In particular, a 4-ball (hypersphere) passing through 3-space would appear as a 3-ball that increased to a maximum and then decreased in size during the transition. This dynamic object (from {{the point of view}} of 3-space) is <b>a</b> sequence <b>of</b> <b>cross-sections</b> <b>of</b> the 4-ball.|$|R
