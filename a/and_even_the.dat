40|$|In {{order to}} measure the {{physical}} load of training of members who belong to the Judo and Basketball teams, urinary proteins before and after routine training were measured by the turbidity method (modified meulemans method) of members. The following results were obtained. 1) In members of the Basketball club, significant increase in actual urinary protein concentration was observed between noon <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> on <b>the</b> first day, between morning and noon, between noon <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> on <b>the</b> second day, between morning and noon, between morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> on <b>the</b> third day and between morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> on <b>the</b> fourth day.

In particular, excretion of myoglobin was recognized. The experiments on optical density of the turbidity method of each fraction were discussed. 4) The main subjective symptoms (from questionnaires) which increased with physical loads were "Whole body getting tired", "Legs getting tired" and "Wanting to lie down" in group I in the basketball club, and "Whole body getting tired", "Legs getting tired", "Feel unsteady standing", "Becoming drowsy", "Wanting to lie down" in group I, "Feeling stiff in the shoulders", "Feeling thirsty" and "Tremor in limbs" in group III in the Judo club. 5) The preliminary care of fatigued members was discussed...|$|R

5|$|Deleury {{suggests}} {{that although the}} temple may have {{been built in the}} 13th century, given the Hemadpanthi style architecture, the statue of Vithoba is of an earlier style so may have been carved for an earlier, smaller shrine that existed in Pandharpur.
