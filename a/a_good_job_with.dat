5000|$|Although {{the song}} was {{extensively}} rehearsed on the Twickenham Studios soundstage, the only recordings were mono transcriptions {{for use in the}} film soundtrack. No multitrack recordings were made after the group's move to Apple Studios. Thus in early January 1970 Glyn Johns remixed the February 1968 recording. The new mix omitted the teenage girls' vocals and the bird sound effects of the World Wildlife Fund version. As neither of the Glyn Johns Get Back albums were officially released, the version most are familiar with came from Phil Spector, who in late March and early April 1970 remixed the February 1968 recording yet again and added orchestral and choral overdubs. Spector also slowed the track to 3:47, close to its original duration. According to Lennon, [...] "Spector took the tape and did <b>a</b> damn <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>with</b> it".|$|R

Flandez was not as pleased by Kurt—or by the Warblers, who he said had ruined the song—and likened his performance to [...] "Jar Jar Binks on acid, with those jerky moves and infantile facial expressions". Roberts called their version [...] "hokey", and Slezak said the setting [...] "felt contrived as heck" [...] and gave the song a [...] "D". Benigno was {{at the other end}} of the scale with an [...] "A" [...] grade and the summary that [...] "they completely crush it", while Gonzalez gave the number an [...] "A+", deemed it [...] "unforgettable", praised the [...] "unique song selection" [...] and called it [...] "pure fun". Futterman described the Warblers as [...] "the loosest they've been all season", but characterized the performance as one of their [...] "least successful" [...] because Blaine and Kurt, [...] "two of the series' most reliable lead singers", were severely overprocessed electronically.

She became a more complicated character than you might have thought in her first few episodes." [...] She praised specific episodes which evolved the character, such as [...] "The Siege of AR-558" [...] which required Ezri to draw upon Dax's past experiences, as otherwise she would have been completely out of her element. De Boer also enjoyed [...] "" [...] as the episode showed the change in Ezri from before she was joined with the Dax symbiont, and she thought that the events portrayed in [...] "" [...] were [...] "fascinating". As she approached the end of Deep Space Nine, de Boer addressed the rumors of her joining , saying that [...] "My first instinct would be to say no.

[...] In particular, the film appeals to college students who have asked Chase to talk about it at film classes. The actor has said that the appeal of the character is [...] "the cheekiness of the guy[...] [...] everybody at that age would like to be as quick-witted as Fletch, and as uncaring about what others think." [...] Chase has said that this film is his favorite to date because [...] "it allowed me to be myself. Fletch was the first one with me really winging it. Even though there was a script, the director allowed me to just go, and in many ways, I was directing the comedy." [...] Perhaps the most meaningful praise comes from Mcdonald himself: [...] "I watched it recently, and I think Chevy and Michael Ritchie did <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] The film was voted as the 23rd best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of Los Angeles Times writers and editors with two criteria: [...] "The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list."
