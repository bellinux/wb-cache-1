Aquino was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>star</b> in the PBL for Nikon and Stag Pale Pilsen but {{was involved in}} a controversial scandal in terms of his academic status at Adamson, although this was later neglected when he jumped pro. Aquino showed the promise Ginebra fans expected during the All-Filipino Conference. It also showed the discovery of former University of Santo Tomas guard Bal David as one of the team's popular players along with Vince Hizon, Jayvee Gayoso, and Pido Jarencio.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, Saavedra and Shulman {{associate}} {{produced the}} New York premiere of Craig Wright's Mistakes Were Made Off-Broadway at the Barrow Street Theatre. The comedy, directed by Dexter Bullard, starred Academy Award-nominated actor Michael Shannon as Felix Artifex, a B-list Off-Broadway producer who gets in way over his fast-talking head {{when he takes}} on a gargantuan epic about the French Revolution which he thinks {{is going to be}} his ticket to professional and personal reclamation. While trying to land <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>star</b> for the lead role, he uses all his powers of persuasion, seduction and intimidation to strong-arm the writer into massively rewriting his play.|$|E
25|$|Pauline Quirke {{was cast}} as secretive caravan {{resident}} Susan Wright. Chibnall {{had long been}} deeply impressed with her performance on the 1996 television series The Sculptress, and he wrote the role of Susan Wright with Quirke in mind, although the role was not written specifically for her. Although Quirke was a well-known veteran television actress, she auditioned along with many others for the role. Her audition, like that of others, used scenes from the first two episodes. Chibnall says that the producers worried that such <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>star</b> might not wish {{to do justice to}} such small role, but found that Quirke delivered a superb performance.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} part of the 1950s Bull Curry {{relocated}} to Texas to work. Curry’s combination of unpredictable violence, unique look and intensity made Curry <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>star</b> in Texas more or less immediately upon arrival. Curry’s brawling style made him a success but it also kept the promoters from giving him the “main” title of the territory despite being the biggest draw in the territory. Instead of letting Bull Curry win the top title of the Texas territory the bookers created a brand new title to match Bull Curry’s Hardcore style of wrestling: the NWA Texas Brass Knuckles Championship which Bull Curry won in a tournament final over Danny McShain on March 6, 1953. Between 1953 and 1967 “Wild Bull” Curry personified the Texas Brass Knuckles Championship as he held it 20 times defeating such names as Fritz Von Erich, Tony Borne, Waldo Von Erich, Louie Tillet, Killer Karl Kox and Brute Bernard for the title. In 1953 Curry would also briefly hold the Texas version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Lucas Pertano as well as the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship for three weeks but soon focused solely on the Brass Knuckles Title.|$|E

Instead of singing the line [...] "You just sit at home and masturbate", he sang, [...] "You just sit at home and la la la".

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Diga Online, Suzuki described the production of her album Lead and single [...] "Blow Out". She described how difficult life was {{as a high school}} student while she was focusing on her music career. Following her graduation from high school and entering university, she felt that she had made many sacrifices for her career. The title of the album came from the idea that she had become a new person after her concert during her 20th birthday, as she wanted to [...] "lead everyone" [...] through her songs. The song [...] "My Shining Ray" [...] was written to represent <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>star</b> that would that would lead people; she also described her experience singing the song as feeling like she was spreading wings. While singing the song [...] "Redo" [...] for Re:Zero, she considered it fun to sing as it [...] "was completely different from herself".

500|$|Mendes had Spacey and Bening in {{mind for}} the leads from the beginning, but DreamWorks {{executives}} were unenthusiastic. The studio suggested several alternatives, including Bruce Willis, Kevin Costner, or John Travolta to play Lester, and Helen Hunt or Holly Hunter to play Carolyn. Mendes did not want <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>star</b> [...] "weighing the film down"; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films The Usual Suspects and Seven, and 1992's Glengarry Glen Ross. Spacey was surprised; he said, [...] "I usually play characters who are very quick, very manipulative and smart. [...] I usually wade in dark, sort of treacherous waters. This is a man living {{one step at a}} time, playing by his instincts. This is actually much closer to me, to what I am, than those other parts." [...] Mendes offered Bening the role of Carolyn without the studio's consent; although executives were upset at Mendes, by September 1998, DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and Bening.|$|E
500|$|Although {{all four}} members contributed to songwriting and vocals {{on the first}} album, Chilton and Bell {{dominated}} as a duo intentionally modeled on John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The album was recorded by Ardent founder John Fry, with Terry Manning contributing occasional backing vocals and keyboards. The title #1Record was decided {{towards the end of}} the recording sessions and evinced, albeit as a playful hope rather than a serious expectation, the chart position to be achieved by <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>star.</b> Although Fry—at the band's insistence—was credited as [...] "executive producer", publicly he insisted that [...] "the band themselves really produced these records". Fry recalled how Ardent, one of the first recording studios to use a sixteen-track tape machine, worked experimentally with the band members: [...] "We started recording the songs with the intent that if it turned out OK we'd put it out [...] I wound up being the one that primarily worked on it: I recorded all the tracks and then they would often come late at night and do overdubs. One by one, they all learned enough engineering." ...|$|E

Cusick stated that most of his scenes were filmed with Haig and John Noble (Walter Bishop), and that the story leaves a possibility for the return of their characters in the future. Noble found it unusual to film an episode that did not involve the lead actors. He explained, [...] "That was Walter with two really big, important guest stars, Henry Ian Cusick and Georgina Haig. It felt, to me, like it was a really strong episode. The two guest actors did a fantastic job, which is not easy to do, to step into an established company. It is out of the box and is somewhere else completely. I think that the fans will love it. Some fans of this type of material will like it anyway because Henry Ian Cusick was such <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>star</b> in Lost, but also, this new girl is just full of wonderful energy, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone {{believed}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] was exemplary in that [...] "Swift is a songwriting savant with {{an intuitive}} gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture". Rosen compared her songwriting in the track {{to that of}} producers Dr. Luke and Max Martin, who he referred to as [...] "Swedish pop gods". He continued, [...] "Her music mixes an almost impersonal professionalism — it's so rigorously crafted {{it sounds like it}} has been scientifically engineered in a hit factory — with confessions that are squirmingly intimate and true." [...] Jonathon Keefe of Slant Magazine considered the bridge one of the nicer moments of Fearless, but was unimpressed with Swift's singing, particularly in the outro. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic found [...] "Fifteen", in which Swift portrayed the role of a big sister instead of <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>star,</b> {{to be one of the}} best and the most personal song on Fearless. Ken Tucker of Billboard magazine believed [...] "Fifteen" [...] could appeal with teenagers looking for hope and adult women reminiscing the past. Leah Greenbelt of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "When she sings about sexuality, she sounds like a real teen, not some manufactured vixen-Lolita".|$|E
500|$|In the 2010 film Blood Done Sign My Name, {{which was}} {{based on a true story}} of small town racial turmoil set in a {{backdrop}} of belated segregation in 1970, Parker plays a 22-year-old Benjamin Chavis. Parker's Chavis was a teacher who had been born into an affluent African-American family and would later become the Executive Director of the N.A.A.C.P. A. O. Scott of The New York Times described Parker as [...] "diffident" [...] and his portrayal as [...] "thoughtful, morally serious". Steven Rea of the Philadelphia Inquirer notes that events in the film move Parker with both [...] "resolve and rage": Roger Ebert described Parker's Chavis as [...] "energized and angered" [...] in one of the two main storylines of the film that started with Chavis leading an economic boycott after an adverse court verdict. Parker's character was [...] "peripheral" [...] according to The New York Post Kyle Smith and upstaged according to Scott and Ebert. However, Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune noted that Parker's portrayal infused dimension into Chavis, whose cousin's death was the subject of the film. Phillips noted that the role showed that with the right choices Parker had the potential to be <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>star</b> in the future.|$|E

500|$|By the 1922 season, Hornsby was {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>star,</b> having {{led the league}} in batting average, hits, doubles, and runs batted in multiple times. As a result, he sought a three-year contract for $25,000 per season. After negotiating with Cardinals management, he settled for a three-year, $18,500 contract ($ today), which made him the highest-paid player in league history to that point. On August 5, Hornsby set a new NL record when he hit his 28th home run of the season off of Jimmy Ring of the Philadelphia Phillies. From August13 through September19, he had a 33-game hitting streak. Hornsby set National League records in 1922 with 42home runs, 250 hits and a [...]722 slugging percentage (still the highest ever for players with 600+ at-bats).

His 450total bases in 1922 remain the National League single-season record. On defense, Hornsby led all second basemen in putouts, double plays, and fielding percentage. His batting performance that year was, and still is, one of the finest in MLB history, and his 42 home runs are still the most ever for a [...]400 hitter.|$|E

Pohren said that de Lucía's performance [...] "was brilliant technically, and played a meaningful, moving, traditional brand of flamenco that did not betray what Paco had in store for the flamenco guitar in the future." [...] The recording was released as En vivo desde el Teatro Real. His 1976 album, Almoraima, was a wider success and featured Almoraima and Río Ancho. The album was named after a former convent of the same name located about [...] from Algeciras on the road to Jimena de la Frontera, which had recently been converted into a hotel complex. The album featured significant Arabic and jazz influences especially in the bulerías composition of the same name; the name Almoraima is of Arabic origin from the Moorish period. De Lucía performed on an episode of Parkinson on BBC in the UK, in which Michael Parkinson said [...] "a marvelous young musician who is making his very first appearance on British television.
