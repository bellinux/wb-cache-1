25|$|The ADVENT {{engine was}} {{originally}} targeted at the Air Force's 2018 Next-Generation Bomber, but uncertainty in that program has led Rolls-Royce (RR), {{one of the}} primary developers involved with the project, to predict that the ADVENT engine will be better suited for a potential 2020 engine upgrade for the F-35 Lightning II. RR, who is partnered with GE Aviation on the embattled F136 alternate engine for the F-35, has suggested that the ADVENT development contracts are <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> continue the F136, as any engine upgrade from Pratt & Whitney (makers of the F135 engine currently used in the F-35) would have to be separately funded, either internally or to additional government cost.|$|E
500|$|Derrickson chose Nepal as a {{location}} to feature an [...] "Eastern city" [...] {{that would not}} be familiar to most audiences. After scouting and deciding on locations in the country, many of those areas were destroyed by the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. Rather than choosing another country, Derrickson and Cumberbatch felt that bringing attention and tourism to Nepal following the event [...] "was <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> shoot there". Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was [...] "absolutely vital to this film, I think not least because it’s so based in something that is exotic. It was a magical way to start the shoot. It’s important to a film like this—which has a profound gearshift into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension—that the portal for that be in a place that actually happens in itself to be incredibly spiritual and marvelous." [...] The eventual filming locations around the Kathmandu Valley included the Pashupatinath and Swayambhunath Temples; Thamel and New Road in Kathmandu; and the Patan Durbar Square in Patan.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of 30 Rock was {{reviewed}} favorably by critics. Metacritic gave the pilot episode a Metascore—a weighted average {{based on the}} impressions of a select thirty-one critical reviews—of 67 out of 100. Robert Abele of LA Weekly declared that the show was a [...] "weirdly appropriate and hilarious symbol of our times". The Wall Street Journals Dorothy Rabinowitz wrote that the [...] "standard caution is relevant—debut episodes tend to be highly polished. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> enjoy the hilarious scenes and fine ensemble cast here". Some less favorable reviews were received from Brian Lowry of Variety. Lowry said, [...] "Despite her success with Mean Girls, [...] Fey mostly hits too-familiar notes in the pilot. Moreover, she's a limited protagonist, which is problematic." [...] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune criticized [...] "30Rock for being less {{than the sum of}} its parts, and, as an entry in the single-camera comedy sweepstakes, it fails to show either the inspired inventiveness of Arrested Development or provide the surprisingly perceptive character studies of The Office".|$|E

60|$|Now {{the spirit}} of pride cannot {{understand}} the beauty of humility, and {{the spirit of}} self-will cannot understand the beauty of obedience; and, therefore, it is reasonable to suppose the devil could not understand our Lord. If He be the Son of God, so might Satan argue, He has <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> be proud; and, therefore, it is all the more easy to tempt Him into shewing His pride, into proving Himself a conceited, self-willed, rebellious being--in one word, an evil spirit.|$|E
60|$|Spain was {{considering}} {{the invasion of}} Tuscany with the ultimate object of assailing Milan and driving the French out of the peninsula altogether. Piero de'Medici--killed at Garigliano--had no doubt been serving Spain with some such end in view as the conquest of Florence, and, though Piero was dead, {{there was no reason}} why the plan should be abandoned; rather, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> carry it forward, since now Spain would more directly profit by it. Bartolomeo d'Alviano was to have commanded the army destined for that campaign; but Cesare, by virtue of his friends and influence in Pisa, Siena, and Piombino, was so preferable a captain for such an expedition that Gonzalo gave him charge of it within a few days of his arrival at the Spanish camp.|$|E
60|$|I {{had often}} admired a lassie before then, if scarce so sudden and strong; {{and it was}} rather my {{disposition}} to withdraw than to come forward, for I was much in fear of mockery from the womenkind. You would have thought I had now <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> pursue my common practice, since I had met this young lady in the city street, seemingly following a prisoner, and accompanied with two very ragged indecent-like Highlandmen. But there was here a different ingredient; it was plain the girl thought I had been prying in her secrets; and with my new clothes and sword, {{and at the top}} of my new fortunes, this was more than I could swallow. The beggar on horseback could not bear to be thrust down so low, or, at the least of it, not by this young lady.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know," [...] {{replied the}} girl sadly. [...] "That's <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> you should {{let me help}} you. Pray don't refuse. It will--mean so much to me." ...|$|R

I did not find it necessary to mistreat Mrs. Smiley in order to test her powers. But Eusapia has set a new pace for mediums. She has gone into the lion's den alone and unarmed--not once, but a hundred times. She entered Lombroso's study, a room previously unexplored by her, and there placed herself before a cabinet that she was not permitted to examine--a cabinet filled with machines for dividing the true from the false. In Morselli's presence she submitted to tests the like of which not even Crookes was permitted to apply, and all sacred rules and regulations, all ideas of religion or questions of morality, vanished when she entered the cold, clear air of Bottazzi's physiological laboratory." ...|$|E
6000|$|It is the {{business}} of biography to depict a physiognomy and not to analyse a type. In our case there is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> think of this, because type hardly applies to a figure like Gladstone's, without any near or distant parallel, and composed of so many curious dualisms and unforeseen affinities. Truly was it said of Fénelon, that half of him {{would be a great}} man, and would stand out more clearly as a great man than does the whole, because it would be simpler. So of Mr. Gladstone. We are dazzled by the endless versatility of his mind and interests as man of action, scholar, and controversial athlete; as legislator, administrator, leader of the people; as the strongest of his time in the main branches of executive force, strongest in persuasive force; supreme in the exacting details of national finance; master of the parliamentary arts; yet always living in the noble visions of the moral and spiritual idealist. This opulence, vivacity, profusion, and the promise of it all in these days of early prime, made an awakening impression even on his foremost contemporaries. The impression might have been easier to reproduce, if he had been less infinitely mobile. 'I cannot explain my own foundation,' Fénelon said; 'it escapes me; it seems to change every hour.' How are we to seek an answer to the same question in the history of Mr. Gladstone? ...|$|E
60|$|Property in Great Britain is secure. It {{would be}} a great mistake to suppose that that {{security}} depends upon the House of Lords. If the security of property in a powerful nation like our own were dependent upon the action or inaction of 500 or 600 persons, that security would long ago have been swept away. The security of property depends upon its wide diffusion among great numbers and all classes of the population, and it becomes more secure year by year because it is gradually being more widely distributed. The vital processes of civilisation require, and the combined interests of millions guarantee, the security of property. A society in which property was insecure would speedily degenerate into barbarism; a society in which property was absolutely secure, irrespective of all conceptions of justice in regard to the manner of its acquisition, would degenerate, not to barbarism, but death. No one claims that a Government should from time to time, according to its conceptions of justice, attempt fundamentally to recast the bases on which property is erected. The process must be a gradual one; must be a social and a moral process, working steadily in the mind and {{in the body of the}} community; but we contend, when new burdens have to be apportioned, when new revenues have to be procured, when the necessary upkeep of the State requires further taxes to be imposed--we contend that, in distributing the new burdens, a Government should have regard first of all to ability to pay and, secondly, that they should have regard to some extent, and so far as is practicable, to the means and the process by which different forms of wealth have been acquired; and that they should make a sensible difference between wealth which is the fruit of productive enterprise and industry or of individual skill, and wealth which represents the capture by individuals of socially created values. We say that ought to be taken into consideration. We are taking it into consideration now by the difference we have made in the income-tax between earned and unearned incomes, by the difference we make between the taxation which is imposed upon a fortune which a man makes himself and the fortune which he obtains from a relative or a stranger. We are taking it into consideration in our tax on mining royalties, in our licence duties and in our taxes on the unearned increment in land. The State, we contend, has a special claim upon the monopoly value of the liquor licence, which the State itself has created, and which the State itself maintains from year to year by its sole authority. If that claim has not previously been made good, that is only because the liquor interest have had the power, by using one branch of the Legislature, to keep the nation out of its rights. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> make our claim good now.|$|E

50|$|Blackburn {{fans were}} thrilled {{after the end}} of the season when 21-year-old Norwich City striker Chris Sutton joined the club for an English record fee of £5 million.

5000|$|... "The {{parallels}} between Grief 's emotionally immured protagonist and Mary Lincoln, ravaged and ultimately destroyed by grief over her husband's death, are evident but not overplayed. And the narrator's {{decision as to}} how to live the remainder of his life seems as etched in stone as the words he reads on the city's monuments. Still, in the end, Holleran's moving novel is mostly about human resilience and hope; our enduring need to love, despite our losses. The beautiful life is brief: <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> embrace it." ...|$|E

The latter publication, according to Rajan, [...] "still publishes writing on politics, history and culture that is among the finest produced in English today.

50|$|Uccala, who {{was from}} a side-branch of the Lohara royal line, succeeded to the throne and reigned for a decade. He and his younger brother, Sussala, had been spotted by Harsa as pretenders to his crown during the unrest and in 1100 {{had been forced to}} flee. The move did them no harm as it {{increased}} their status among the dāmaras: if Harsa wanted the brothers dead then that was <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> rally around them. It was as a consequence of this that Uccala was able to mount armed attacks on Harsa, as in 1101, which although initially unsuccessful did eventually achieve their aim as those closest to Harsa deserted him.|$|E

It’s my sincere prayer that the simple message of this song would resonate in people’s hearts. I wrote it after a moving conversation I had with a man who told me his story. It was a story of God’s faithfulness during a struggling time. How God can turn things that seem so grim into things that give Him glory.
