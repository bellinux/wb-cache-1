50|$|The submarine's rusting hull was {{well-known}} to locals, {{but they}} had presumed {{it to be a}} remnant of World War II. In 2001, after many years of misidentification, the remains of the Sub Marine Explorer piqued the interest of archaeologist James P. Delgado of the Institute of Nautical Archaeology. Identification of the craft, with the assistance of submarine historians Richard Wills and Eugene Canfield, led to four archaeological expeditions to the Explorer in 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008. Documentation of the Sub Marine Explorer has resulted in detailed plans, including interpretive reconstructions of the craft, scientific study of its environment and interaction with the surrounding water, bathymetric assessment, scientific <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> of corrosion, and considerable historical research. Work in 2006 was funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration through the Office of Ocean Exploration. The 2008 expedition was funded by the Waitt Institute for Discovery of La Jolla. The vessel is now included in the Historic American Engineering Record of the U.S. National Park Service. A recent (2007) report summarizes preservation options for the submarine for the Panamanian government and recommends the recovery, preservation and public display of the craft in Panama. Metal analysis confirms that the craft is in a critical stage and faces irreversible deterioration and loss.|$|E

40|$|When {{economic}} capital is calculated using a portfolio model of credit value-at-risk, the marginal capital requirement for an instrument depends, in general, on {{the properties of}} the portfolio in which it is held. By contrast, ratings-based capital rules, including both the current Basel Accord and its proposed revision, assign a capital charge to an instrument based only on its own characteristics. I demonstrate that ratings-based capital rules can be reconciled with the general class of credit VaR models. Contributions to VaR are portfolio-invariant only if (a) there is only a single systematic risk factor driving correlations across oblig-ors, and (b) no exposure in a portfolio accounts for more than an arbitrarily small share of total exposure. <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> of convergence to asymptotic VaR leads to a simple and accurate portfolio-level add-on charge for undiversified idiosyncratic risk.

40|$|Addition of Cu(II) ions {{to human}} oxyhaemoglobin caused the rapid {{oxidation}} of the haem {{groups of the}} beta-chain. Oxidation required binding of Cu(II) to sites involving the thiol group of beta- 93 residues and was prevented when these groups were blocked with iodoacetamide or N-ethylmaleimide. Equilibrium-dialysis studies showed three pairs of binding sites, two pairs with high affinity for Cu(II) and one pair with lower affinity. It was the second pair of high-affinity sites that were blocked with iodoacetamide and were involved in haem oxidation. Cu(II) oxidized deoxyhaemoglobin at least ten {{times as fast as}} oxyhaemoglobin, and <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> suggested that binding rather than electron transfer was the rate-determining step. No thiol-group oxidation to disulphides occurred during the period of haem oxidation, although it did occur subsequently in the presence of oxygen, or when Cu(II) was added to methaemoglobin. It is proposed that thiol oxidation did not occur because there exists a pathway of electron transfer between the haem group and copper bound to the beta- 93 thiol groups. The route for this electron transfer is discussed, as well as the implications as to the function of the beta- 93 cysteine in the haemoglobin molecule...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the irreversible nucleation {{and growth of}} two-dimensional islands during submonolayer deposition in the regime of large island sizes. A quasihydrodynamic <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rate</b> equations for island densities yields an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the scaling function describing the island size distribution. This ODE involves the scaling function for the dependence on island size of “capture numbers” describing the aggregation of diffusing adatoms. The latter is determined via a quasihydrodynamic <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rate</b> equations for the areas of “capture zones” surrounding islands. Alternatively, a more complicated analysis yields a partial differential equation (PDE) for the scaling function describing the joint probability distribution for island sizes and capture zone areas. Then, applying a moment analysis to this PDE, we obtain refined versions of the above ODE’s, together with a third equation for the variance of the cell area distribution (for islands of a given size). The key nontrivial input to the above equations is a detailed characterization of nucleation. We analyze these equations for a general formulation of nucleation, {{as well as for}} an idealized picture considered previously, wherein nucleated islands have capture zones lying completely within those of existing islands...|$|R
