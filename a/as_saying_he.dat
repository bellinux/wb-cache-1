Galland set up a course in late 1943, but it only lasted a few months. Galland was quoted <b>as</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> thought they could learn the skills while on operations, as he had. This ignored his own talents, and blithely expected other pilots to reach his high standards.|$|E

Fielder-Civil's father encouraged fans to boycott Winehouse's music, and Mitch Winehouse said this would not help. Fielder-Civil was quoted in a British tabloid <b>as</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> introduced Winehouse to crack cocaine and heroin. During a visit with Mitch Winehouse at the prison in July 2008, Fielder-Civil reportedly {{said that he and}} Winehouse would cut themselves to ease the pain of withdrawal.|$|E

He {{was as good as}} his word: Pablo made his Segunda División debut in a 1–1 draw away to Terrassa on 31 August 2002, and went on to start 38 of Albacete's 42 matches as they finished the season in third place and were promoted to La Liga. After only a few second-tier matches, he had made sufficient impact to attract interest from clubs both domestic and foreign and receive a call-up to the Spanish under-21 team for a friendly match against Bulgaria.|$|E

His interviews with the personnel involved confirmed the cursory nature of the investigation made by the MoD, and failed to find any evidence for any other reports on the incident made by the USAF or UK apart from the Halt memo. Halt has since gone on record <b>as</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> believes that he witnessed an extraterrestrial event that was then covered up.|$|E
25|$|Carpenter had {{intended}} Richard Dreyfuss as Andy McGee, but when The Thing was a financial disappointment, Universal replaced Carpenter with Mark L. Lester. Ironically, Carpenter's next film, Christine, was the 1983 {{adaptation of the}} Stephen King novel of the same name. The story concerns a high-school nerd named Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) who buys a junked 1958 Plymouth Fury {{which turns out to}} have supernatural powers. As Cunningham restores and rebuilds the car, he becomes unnaturally obsessed with it, with deadly consequences. Christine did respectable business upon its release and was received well by critics; however, Carpenter has been quoted <b>as</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> directed the film {{because it was the only}} thing offered to him at the time.|$|E
25|$|By October 1975 Bentsen, {{generating}} little {{national attention}} or {{significance in the}} polls, scaled back his campaign to a limited effort in areas of 8 to 10 states, hoping for a deadlocked convention. In the first state contest Bentsen vigorously contested, Mississippi, he managed only 1.6% of the vote. Two weeks later Bentsen staked {{the remainder of his}} campaign and resources in neighboring Oklahoma but finished third with only 12%. A few days later Bentsen shut down his national campaign, staying in the race only as a favorite son in Texas. However, in the May 1, 1976, primary Jimmy Carter won 92 of Texas's 98 delegates. The eventual nominee and president, Carter was later quoted <b>as</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> had expected a much stronger showing by Bentsen but that Bentsen's failure to campaign nationally had ended his hopes.|$|E

25|$|On May 19, 2009 {{the show}} {{recorded}} its last episode at WMAQ-TV's NBC Tower in Chicago, Illinois, {{where it had}} been videotaped since 1992, midway through the second season. Beginning with the 2009–10 season, production was moved to the Rich Forum in Stamford, Connecticut after NBCUniversal received tax credits from the state of Connecticut to move Springer, along with Maury and Steve Wilkos to the Nutmeg State, along with NBC Sports. Jerry was quoted <b>as</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> was not happy with the move, but understood the financial reasons for which it was being done, and is working to secure jobs for those on his staff who wish to move with the show. Since moving to Stamford, the show has gone through a number of changes; the set has become more highly colored with new lighting, new chairs for guests, two new security guards, and a change to its iconic theme music.|$|E
25|$|Freddie Ross {{worked as}} his {{publicist}} from 1954, and became {{more involved in}} his life, eventually becoming his mistress. He divorced Cicely in 1965, and married Ross in December of that year. This second marriage was short-lived. During these years, Hancock was also involved with Joan Le Mesurier (née Malin), the new wife of actor John Le Mesurier, Hancock's best friend and a regular supporting character-actor from his television series. Joan was later to describe the relationship in her book Lady Don't Fall Backwards, including the claim that her husband readily forgave the affair; {{if it had been}} anyone else, he is quoted <b>as</b> <b>saying,</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't have understood it, but with Tony Hancock, it made sense. In July 1966, Freddie took an overdose, but survived. Arriving in Blackpool to record an edition of his variety series, Hancock was met by pressmen asking about his wife's attempted suicide. The final dissolution of the marriage took place a few days ahead of Hancock's own suicide.|$|E
