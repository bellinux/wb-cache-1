30|$|The OGMA fire history {{suggested}} that fires were larger Post-EAS, {{contrary to the}} findings of Clark et al. (2007). The increase in percent of cross-sections scarred between the Osage and Creek time periods appeared to be linked to the OGMA settlement history.

The increases in percent scarred between the Creek and Post-EAS and between the Pre- and Post-EAS time periods may be explained by an increase in human occupation and, later, changes in fire management following the acquisition of OGMA by the ODWC; six of the seven fire years with the highest percent of cross-sections scarred occurred after the ODWC acquisition of OGMA (Table 1). The ODWC probably had more resources available and may have initiated prescribed burning on a scale larger than that of fires set by previous private landowners.|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to explore whether there was a size-dependent pattern (in terms of resulting burned <b>area)</b> of fire <b>ignitions</b> in Portugal. For that purpose we characterised 71, 618 fire ignitions occurring in the country in the period 2001 – 2003, in terms of population density in the local parish, land cover type and distance to roads. We then assigned each ignition into subsets of five classes according to the resulting burned area:[5 ha, [50 ha,[100 ha,[250 ha,[500 ha. The probability of an ignition resulting in different burned area classes was modelled using binary logistic regression, and the relative importance, strength and signal (positive or negative) of the three explanatory variables compared across the models obtained for the different classes. Finally, we explored the implications of land cover and population density changes during the period 1990 – 2000 in Portugal for the likelihood of ignitions resulting in wildfires[500 ha. Population density was the more important variable explaining the resulting burned area, with the probability of an ignition resulting in a large burned area being inversely related to population density. In terms of land cover, ignitions resulting in large burned areas were more likely to occur in shrubland and forest <b>areas.</b> Finally, <b>ignitions</b> farther away from roads were more likely to result in large burns. The current land cover trends (decrease of agricultural land and increase in shrublands) and population trends (decline in population densities except near the coast) are increasing the probability that ignitions will result in large fires in vast regions of the country...|$|R

40|$|ATEX (Explosive Atmosphere) risk {{assessment}} is required when any equipment or system could potentially cause explosive atmospheres. Despite many operations on {{plant and equipment}} containing dangerous substances are performed by operators, influences of human and organizational factor (HOF) are mostly not adequately considered during ATEX {{risk assessment}}. The integrated methodology here described (ATEX-HOF) is proposed to address two challenges: the identification and the quantification of HOF influence on ATEX risk assessment. The proposed methodology enriches the traditional ATEX risk assessment procedure, which consists of four steps: 1) <b>Area</b> classification, 2) <b>Ignition</b> source identification, 3) Damage analysis, and 4) ATEX Risk evaluation. ATEX risk assessment methodology is mainly semi-quantitative, while ATEX-HOF methodology provides a quantitative analysis for the <b>Area</b> classification and <b>Ignition</b> source identification, and a semi-quantitative approach for the Damage analysis. As a result, ATEX-HOF risk evaluation becomes more accurate. A probabilistic assessment based on event trees was introduced, taking into account both the technical barrier failure (Prtbf) and the human intervention in terms of Human Error Probability (HEP). The on-site application showed that taking into account HOFs could be particular important, especially for those companies where the safety culture is lower and consequently the usual hypothesis related to the correctness of the operator intervention (in maintenance, normal operations, and emergency) could bring to not conservative results...|$|R
40|$|The {{ignition}} of Al/CuO multilayered {{material is}} studied experimentally {{to explore the}} effect of heating surface area, layering and film thickness on the ignition characteristics and reaction performances. After {{the description of the}} micro-initiator devices and ignition conditions, we show that the heating surface area has to be properly calibrated to optimize the nanothermite ignition performances. We demonstrated experimentally that a heating surface area of 0. 25 mm 2 is sufficient to ignite a multilayered thermite film of 1. 6 mm wide by a few cm long, with a success rate of 100 %. A new analytical and phenomenological ignition model based on atomic diffusion across layers and thermal exchange is also proposed. This model considers that CuO first decomposes into Cu 2 O, the oxygen diffusing across Cu 2 O and Al 2 O 3 layers before reaching the Al layer where it reacts to form Al 2 O 3. The theoretical results in terms of ignition response times confirm the experimental observation. The increase of the heating surface area leads to an increase of the ignition response time and ignition power threshold (go/no go condition). We also evidence that for any heating surface <b>area,</b> the <b>ignition</b> time rapidly decreases when the electrical power density increases until an asymptotic value, named minimum response ignition time, which is a characteristic of the multilayered thermite itself. At the stoichiometric ratio (Al thickness is half of CuO one), the minimum ignition response time can be easily tuned from 59 µs to 418 ms by tuning the heating surface <b>area.</b> The minimum <b>ignition</b> response time increases when the bilayer thickness increases. Not only this work gives a set of micro-initiator design rules to obtain the best ignition conditions and reaction performances but it also details a reliable and robust MEMS process to fabricate igniters and it brings new understanding of phenomena governing the ignition process of Al/CuO multilayers...|$|R

Department of Energy, Nevada Operations Office's approach {{to collect the}} data necessary to evaluate corrective action alternatives appropriate for the closure of Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 490 under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Corrective Active Unit 490 consists of four Corrective Action Sites (CASs) : 03 - 56 - 001 - 03 BA, Fire Training Area (FTA); RG- 56 - 001 -RGBA, Station 44 Burn Area; 03 - 58 - 001 - 03 FN, Sandia Service Yard; and 09 - 54 - 001 - 09 L 2, Gun Propellant Burn Area. These CASs are located at the Tonopah Test Range near Areas 3 and 9. Historically, the FTA was used for training exercises where tires and wood were ignited with diesel fuel. Records indicate that water and carbon dioxide were the only extinguishing agents used during these training exercises. The Station 44 Burn Area was used for fire training exercises and consisted of two wooden structures. The two burn <b>areas</b> (<b>ignition</b> of tires, wood, and wooden structures with diesel fuel and water) were limited to the building footprints (10 ft by 10 ft each). The Sandia Service Yard was used for storage (i. e., wood, tires, metal, electronic and office equipment, construction debris, and drums of oil/grease) from approximately 1979 to 1993. The Gun Propellant Burn Area was used from the 1960 s to 1980 s to burn excess artillery gun propellant, solid-fuel rocket motors, black powder, and deteriorated explosives; additionally, the area {{was used for the}} disposal of experimental explosive items. Based on site history, the focus of the field investigation activities will be to: (1) determine the presence of contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) at each CAS, (2) determine if any COPCs exceed field-screening levels and/or preliminary action levels, and (3) determine {{the nature and extent of}} contamination with enough certainty to support selection of corrective action alternatives for each CAS. The scope of this CAIP is to resolve the question of whether or not potentially hazardous wastes were generated at three of the four CASs within CAU 490, and whether or not potentially hazardous and radioactive wastes were generated at the fourth CAS in CAU 490 (CAS 09 - 54 - 001 - 09 L 2). Suspected CAS-specific COPCs include volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, total petroleum hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides, explosives, and uranium and plutonium isotopes. The results of this field investigation will support a defensible evaluation of corrective action alternatives in the corrective action decision document...|$|R

Wildfire simulation and network analysis were used to quantify the exchange of fire among land tenures and communities and analyze the relative contributions of human versus natural ignitions to wildfire exposure. Among the land tenures examined, the area burned by incoming fires averaged 57 % of the total burned area. Community exposure from incoming fires ignited on surrounding land tenures accounted for 67 % of the total area burned. The number of land tenures contributing wildfire to individual communities and surrounding wildland urban interface (WUI) varied from 3 to 20. Community firesheds, i. e. the <b>area</b> where <b>ignitions</b> can spawn fires that can burn into the WUI, covered 40 % of the landscape, and were 5. 5 {{times larger than the}} combined area of the community core and WUI.

The study provides a multi-scale characterization of wildfire networks within a large, mixed tenure and fire prone landscape, and illustrates the connectivity of risk between communities and the surrounding wildlands. We use the findings to discuss how scale mismatches in local wildfire governance result from disconnected planning systems and disparate fire management objectives among the large landowners (federal, state, private) and local communities. Local and regional risk planning processes can adopt our concepts and methods to better define and map the scale of wildfire risk from large fire events and incorporate wildfire network and connectivity concepts into risk assessments...|$|R
30|$|Our process {{necessarily}} generalized across {{scales of}} both space and time. In general, and assuming all else is equal, areas with higher precipitation or less ignition {{within a given}} PFR {{would be expected to}} burn less often than drier <b>areas</b> with an <b>ignition</b> source (Agee 1993, Sugihara et al. 2006). A PFR in northwestern California therefore might be expected to support somewhat longer fire return intervals than the same PFR in southern California. A solution for this may be to use the median fire frequency as the preferred measure of central tendency for PFRs in parts of their range where vegetation is relatively more flammable, and the mean fire frequency where vegetation is relatively less flammable (at least where the median is shorter than the mean, which is the typical case). Patch sizes can also influence fire frequency, with small patches of mesic vegetation embedded in a matrix of drier vegetation having shorter fire return intervals than large patches of mesic vegetation, and vice-versa (Agee et al. 1990 a). Obviously, where higher local accuracy is required, the reader should consult the primary literature (e.g., see the citations supporting Table 2).|$|R
40|$|Prior {{research}} in the Rhyolite Canyon area of Chiricahua National Monument (Swetnam et. al. 1989) revealed an anomalous 50 year fire-free interval between 1801 and 1851. Disruption of fire spread resulting from flooding and mass soil movement (debris flows) were postulated as potential causes of this long interval. The present study gathered additional evidence of fire and floods in the canyon system. Sampling of flood-scarred trees along stream channels successfully identified several flood events in Rhyolite canyon. Pulses of pine regeneration on debris flow deposits were associated {{with one of these}} events. However, no definitive linkage of flood events with changes in fire regime was established. Analysis of new fire scar samples combined with previous results indicated that the area affected by the change in fire regime includes the uplands between Jesse James Canyon and Rhyolite drainage. Source areas for tires prior to 1900 were not identified within the study <b>area</b> indicating that <b>ignitions</b> outside the present monument boundaries may have been important in the past. Evidence from the maximum ages of overstory conifers within Rhyolite Canyon suggests the occurrence of a major disturbance within this drainage prior to 1600...|$|R
30|$|Understanding fire {{regimes in}} the coastal region of the Pondoland center of plant endemism, (Eastern Cape, South Africa) is of {{critical}} importance, especially in <b>areas</b> where anthropogenic <b>ignitions</b> influence the fire regime. We characterized the fire regime (2007 to 2016) of Mkambati Nature Reserve (9200 ha) in terms of fire season, seasonality of fire-prone weather conditions, fire return interval (FRI), and influence of poaching-related ignitions. Fires were concentrated in winter when monthly fire danger weather index was highest. The mean FRI at Mkambati was < 3 years, but varied according to vegetation type, and whether censoring (for open-ended FRIs) was applied. Mean estimated FRIs were 2.6 yr to 3.1 yr {{in the majority of}} grassland types, 5.6 yr to 8.0 yr in forests, and 9.0 yr to 44.4 yr in Themeda triandra Forssk. grasslands. Poachers, with the intention of attracting ungulates, are an important source of ignitions at Mkambati. Accordingly, FRIs were shorter (1.99 yr to 2.08 yr) in areas within 3 km of likely poacher entry points than in areas farther away (2.56 yr to 2.88 yr). Although all fires recorded at Mkambati during the study period were of anthropogenic origin, mean FRI still fell within the natural range reported for interior grasslands in South Africa.|$|R
30|$|The {{identification}} of lightning {{as an important}} ignition source gained acceptance slowly {{over the last century}} in the United States. For instance, the idea was not widely accepted for forests in the Rocky Mountain West until the 1920 s and underestimated for grasslands through the mid- 1980 s (Komarek 1968, Baker 2002). Eastern deciduous forests in general and the southern Appalachians in particular have not escaped this evolution of understanding. Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) studies in the 1980 s classified all burned <b>areas,</b> regardless of <b>ignition</b> source, as non-“virgin” forests; implicitly denying the role of fire as a regular forest process in park ecosystems (Pyle 1985, 1986). The 1902 U.S. Forest Service report on the southern Appalachians acknowledges only anthropogenic sources of fire with no mention of lightning-caused ignitions (Roosevelt 1902). In a 1942 letter to the Chief of Forestry for the National Park Service, the first GSMNP Superintendent, J. R. Eakin, wrote, “I am learning new things about fire here. Until a few years ago I thought lightning would not start fires” (Eakin 1942). Baker (2002) attributes the change in perception to several factors, particularly the growth of forest management practices, proliferation of trained observers, and systematic data collection.|$|R
