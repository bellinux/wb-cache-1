5|$|The {{post-mortem}} examination concluded that Hendrix aspirated his own vomit {{and died of}} <b>asphyxia</b> while intoxicated with barbiturates. At the inquest, the coroner, finding no evidence of suicide and lacking sufficient evidence of the circumstances, recorded an open verdict. Dannemann stated that Hendrix had taken nine of her prescribed Vesparax sleeping tablets, 18 times the recommended dosage.|$|E
5|$|A {{doctor at}} Shanghai's Jing'an Hospital said that over 20 people {{injured in the}} fire had been admitted, many {{suffering}} from <b>asphyxia</b> caused by smoke inhalation. State media reports said the hospital was treating 55 survivors, including nine in serious condition. At least 70 people, and possibly more than 120 people {{were reported to have}} been injured. According to BBC News, people who survived the blaze were searching hospitals for missing family and friends. As of 24 November, 66 wounded people, 14 of which were in critical condition, were being treated at seven area medical centers. In all, nine hospitals received victims of the fire.|$|E
5|$|Martínez Pérez {{was murdered}} {{early in the}} morning of 28 April 2012 in her home in the Felipe Carrillo Puerto {{neighborhood}} in Xalapa, the capital of Veracruz. When police went to her home to investigate in response to a neighbor's call about her door being open all day, Martínez Pérez's corpse was found on the bathroom floor. According to official reports, she had been severely beaten around her face and ribs, and then strangled to death. The cause of death was <b>asphyxia</b> by strangulation. At the time of her death, the Mexican authorities said they were investigating all the possible motives behind her assassination, including personal motives and theft, and that they would investigate whether the killing was work-related.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the lahar {{contained}} boulders and cobbles which would have crushed anyone in their path, while the slower parts were dotted by fine, sharp stones which caused lacerations. Mud moved into open wounds and other open body parts – the eyes, ears, and mouth – and placed pressure capable of inducing traumatic <b>asphyxia</b> {{in one or two}} minutes upon people buried in it. Martí and Ernst state in their work Volcanoes and the Environment that they believe that many who survived the lahars succumbed to their injuries as they were trapped, or contracted hypothermia – though the latter is unlikely, given that survivors described the water as warm.|$|E
5|$|Page wrote most of Led Zeppelin's music, {{particularly}} {{early in}} their career, while Plant generally supplied the lyrics. Jones' keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group's catalogue, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their output and touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death from alcohol-related <b>asphyxia</b> in 1980. In the decades that followed, the surviving members sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Jason Bonham taking his late father's place behind the drums.|$|E
5|$|Assigned {{emergency}} roles {{called for}} Grissom, in the left-hand seat, {{to open the}} cabin pressure vent valve, after which White in the center seat was to open the plug door hatch, while Chaffee in the right-hand seat was to maintain communications. Grissom was prevented from opening the valve by {{the intensity of the}} fire, which started in that region and spread from left to right. Despite this, White removed his restraints and apparently tried in vain to open the hatch, which was held closed by the cabin pressure. The increasing pressure finally burst the inner cabin wall on the right-hand side at 23:31:19 GMT. After approximately thirty seconds of being fed by a cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at pressures of , and now fed by nitrogen-buffered ambient air, the primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke, which killed the astronauts. Chaffee lost consciousness when he experienced myocardial hypoxia, which sent him into cardiac arrest and resulted in cerebral hypoxia. He died from <b>asphyxia</b> due to the toxic gasses from the fire, with burns contributing to his death.|$|E

25|$|Deaths {{often occur}} when the loss of {{consciousness}} caused by partial <b>asphyxia</b> leads to loss {{of control over the}} means of strangulation, resulting in continued <b>asphyxia</b> and death. While often asphyxiophilia is incorporated into sex with a partner, others enjoy this behaviour by themselves, making it potentially more difficult to get out of dangerous situations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the film}} Ken Park a {{character}} named Tate practices autoerotic <b>asphyxia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Intrapartum <b>asphyxia</b> is the {{impairment}} of {{the delivery of}} oxygen to the brain and vital tissues during the progress of labour. This may exist in a pregnancy already impaired by maternal or fetal disease, or may rarely arise de novo in labour. This can be termed fetal distress, but this term may be emotive and misleading. True intrapartum <b>asphyxia</b> is not as common as previously believed, and is usually accompanied by multiple other symptoms during the immediate period after delivery. Monitoring might show up problems during birthing, but the interpretation and use of monitoring devices is complex and prone to misinterpretation. Intrapartum <b>asphyxia</b> can cause long-term impairment, particularly when this results in tissue damage through encephalopathy.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} Anderson's death has been {{variously}} attributed to sickle cell trait exertional death, laryngospasm, and mechanical <b>asphyxia</b> as detailed below.|$|E
25|$|Upon cross-examination, Gacy's {{defense team}} {{attempted}} {{to raise the}} possibility that all 33 murders were accidental erotic <b>asphyxia</b> deaths: Dr. Stein countered this assertion with evidence that Gacy's claim was impossible.|$|E
25|$|In Africa birth <b>asphyxia,</b> high {{bilirubin}} levels, and {{infections in}} newborns {{of the central}} nervous system are main cause. Many cases of CP in Africa could be prevented with better resources available.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, a decomposing woman's {{body was}} found by two fishermen. The {{cause of death was}} {{homicide}} by <b>asphyxia.</b> She was not identified and no leads were ever identified in the case.|$|E
25|$|Patterson and Brown {{had their}} throats slit; the other bodies were in too {{advanced}} state of decomposition {{to determine the}} cause of death, though <b>asphyxia</b> is a suspected cause of death.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypoxemia}} and acidosis {{caused by}} <b>asphyxia</b> in drowning affect various organs. There can be {{central nervous system}} damage, cardiac arhythmias, pulmonary injury, reperfusion injury, and multiple-organ secondary injury with prolonged tissue hypoxia.|$|E
25|$|In 1990s Herceg v. Hustler, Diane Herceg sued Hustler magazine, accusing it {{of causing}} {{the death of}} her 14-year-old son, Troy D., who had experimented with autoerotic <b>asphyxia</b> after reading about it in that publication.|$|E
25|$|Liquefied {{natural gas}} takes up about 1/600th {{the volume of}} natural gas in the gaseous state. It is odorless, colorless, {{non-toxic}} and non-corrosive. Hazards include flammability after vaporization into a gaseous state, freezing, and <b>asphyxia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Michael Hutchence, Australian singer-songwriter {{and member}} of rock band INXS. His death was in 1997 ruled as suicide by the coroner but was {{believed}} by his family and partner {{to be the result}} of autoerotic <b>asphyxia.</b>|$|E
25|$|This sexual {{practice}} is variously called asphyxiophilia, autoerotic <b>asphyxia,</b> hypoxyphilia. The term autoerotic asphyxiation is used when {{the act is}} done by a person to themselves. Colloquially, a person engaging in the activity is sometimes called a gasper.|$|E
25|$|Within {{an hour or}} two of {{admission}} to the hospital, a number of victims began to show signs of <b>asphyxia.</b> Doctors discovered that an unidentified organism was attacking their respiratory systems and pulmonary blood vessels. By the next morning, seven athletes were in critical condition.|$|E
25|$|Waste {{deposition}} in landfills, which generate methane. Methane is highly flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air. Methane {{is also an}} asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space. <b>Asphyxia</b> or suffocation may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below 19.5% by displacement.|$|E
25|$|Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association, {{physician}} William Edwards and {{his colleagues}} supported the combined cardiovascular collapse (via hypovolemic shock) and exhaustion <b>asphyxia</b> theories, assuming that {{the flow of water}} from the side of Jesus described in the Gospel of John was pericardial fluid.|$|E
25|$|Jesse William Dirkhising (May 24, 1986 – September 26, 1999), {{also known}} as Jesse Yates, was an American {{teenager}} from Prairie Grove, Arkansas. He was kidnapped by two men who bound, drugged, tortured, and repeatedly raped him. He died from drugging and positional <b>asphyxia</b> during the ordeal.|$|E
25|$|A large {{overdose}} {{can cause}} <b>asphyxia</b> and death by respiratory depression {{if the person}} does not receive medical attention immediately. Overdose treatment includes the administration of naloxone. The latter completely reverses morphine's effects, but may result in immediate onset of withdrawal in opiate-addicted subjects. Multiple doses may be needed.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} life threat due to GHB overdose (with {{or without}} other substances) is respiratory arrest. Other relatively common {{causes of death}} due to GHB ingestion include aspiration of vomitus, positional <b>asphyxia,</b> and trauma sustained while intoxicated (e.g., motor vehicle accidents while {{driving under the influence}} of GHB). The risk of aspiration pneumonia and positional <b>asphyxia</b> risk can be reduced by laying the patient down in the recovery position. People are most likely to vomit as they become unconscious, and as they wake up. It is important to keep the victim awake and moving, who must not be left alone due to the risk of death through vomiting. Frequently they will be in a good mood but this does not mean they are not in danger. GHB overdose is a medical emergency and immediate assessment in an emergency department is needed.|$|E
25|$|Bowler Yetty Bennett, 50, died {{later that}} day from <b>asphyxia.</b> Elizabeth Sawicki, 47, {{a member of the}} delegation's bridge team, died July 26 from {{complications}} from infection. Bowler Warren Zines, 54, died on August 10, 1997 of severe respiratory-tract infection at Sheba Medical Center. Zines was the fourth and final fatality from the accident.|$|E
25|$|In babies {{that are}} born at term risk factors include {{problems}} with the placenta, birth defects, low birth weight, breathing meconium into the lungs, a delivery requiring either the use of instruments or an emergency Caesarean section, birth <b>asphyxia,</b> seizures just after birth, respiratory distress syndrome, low blood sugar, and infections in the baby.|$|E
25|$|Each year, {{complications}} from pregnancy and childbirth result in about 500,000 maternal deaths, 7 million women have serious long term problems, and 50 million women have health negative outcomes following delivery. Most of these {{occur in the}} developing world. Specific complications include obstructed labour, postpartum bleeding, eclampsia, and postpartum infection. Complications in the baby include birth <b>asphyxia.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 66 {{people died in}} this stampede. According to the {{post-mortem}} examinations, all of the deceased victims died of compressive <b>asphyxia.</b> An additional 61 people were injured, including 21 seriously; 45 of the 66 dead were adolescents, as young as 14, including five young women. The Luzhniki Stadium tragedy was the Soviet Union's worst sporting disaster.|$|E
25|$|According to Madres del Dolor, a judge {{detained}} five {{police officers}} and the police chief of Ramos Mejia in Buenos Aires Province for the February death of 35-year-old Gaston Duffau after an official autopsy confirmed that the victim died from multiple blows to the body and <b>asphyxia.</b> The police officials involved remained in pretrial detention at year's end.|$|E
25|$|<b>Asphyxia</b> {{directly}} causes {{basal ganglia}} damage {{due to lack}} of oxygen and therefore, insufficient nutrient supply. The lesions caused by <b>asphyxia</b> are most prominent on the caudate nucleus and the putamen. However, a less-studied consequence of the resulting hypoxia is its effect on the concentrations of the neurotransmitter dopamine within the synapses of neurons in the basal ganglia. Hypoxia leads to an increase in the extracellular dopamine levels and therefore, an increase in the activity of the dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, this increase in extracellular concentration is not caused by an increase in the neurotransmitter synthesis, but instead on inhibiting its reuptake back into the neurons and glial cells. Therefore, there is an increased dopaminergic effect as dopamine remains in the synapse at higher concentrations leading to additional post-synaptic response. As a result, the uncontrollable writhing motions witnessed with athetosis deal with the over-activity of synapses within the basal ganglia.|$|E
25|$|The great {{majority}} of known erotic asphyxial deaths are male; among all known cases in Ontario and Alberta from 1974 to 1987, {{only one out of}} 117 cases was female. Some individual cases of women with erotic <b>asphyxia</b> have been reported. The main age of accidental death is mid-20s, but deaths have been reported in adolescents and in men in their 70s.|$|E
25|$|Athetosis is {{a symptom}} {{primarily}} caused by the marbling, or degeneration of the basal ganglia. This degeneration is most commonly caused by complications at birth or by Huntington's disease, in addition to rare {{cases in which the}} damage may also arise later in life due to stroke or trauma. The two complications of particular interest are intranatal <b>asphyxia</b> and neonatal jaundice.|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequent}} root cause for diving fatalities {{is running out}} of or low on gas. Other factors cited include buoyancy control, entanglement or entrapment, rough water, equipment misuse or problems and emergency ascent. The most common injuries and causes of death were drowning or <b>asphyxia</b> due to inhalation of water, air embolism and cardiac events. Risk of cardiac arrest is greater for older divers, and greater for men than women, although the risks are equal by age 65.|$|E
25|$|A diagram {{he created}} in 1938 is today {{known as the}} Đaja’s diagram (of thermoregulation) or Đaja’s curve, {{and the way he}} brought organisms to {{hypothermia}} (reducing the body temperature by <b>asphyxia</b> and cold environment and then complete recovery by warming up the organism) is named Đaja’s method of induced hypothermia (“hypercapnian hypothermia”). Đaja also invented an apparatus for the gas exchange measurement (Đaja’s apparatus). He coined the terms peak (or maximal) metabolism and metabolic quotient which entered the textbooks on the subject.|$|E
