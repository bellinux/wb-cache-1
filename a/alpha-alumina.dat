50|$|High-strain-rate {{superplasticity}} {{has been}} observed in aluminium-based and magnesium-based alloys. But for ceramic materials, superplastic deformation has been restricted to low strain rates for most oxides, and nitrides {{with the presence of}} cavities leading to premature failure. Here we show that a composite ceramic material consisting of tetragonal zirconium oxide, magnesium aluminates spinal and <b>alpha-alumina</b> phase exhibit superplasticity at strain rates up to 1.0 s−1. The composite also exhibits a large tensile elongation, exceeding 1050% or a strain rate of 0.4 s−1.Superplastic metals and ceramics have the ability to deform over 100% without fracturing, permitting net-shape forming at high temperatures. These intriguing materials deform primarily by grain boundary sliding, a process accelerated with a fine grain size. However, most ceramics that start with a fine grain size experience rapid grain growth during high temperature deformation, rendering them unsuitable for extended superplastic forming. One can limit grain growth using a minor second phase (Zener pinning) or by making a ceramic with three phases, where grain to grain contact of the same phase is minimized. A research on fine grain three phase alumina-mullite(3Al2O3•2SiO2)-zirconia, with approximately equal volume fractions of the three phases, demonstrates that superplastic strain rates as high as 10−2/sec at 1500 °C can be reached. These high strain rates put ceramic superplastic forming into the realm of commercial feasibility.|$|E

40|$|In this work, a seeding {{technique}} {{was used to}} synthesize films and membranes of FAU, LTA and MFI type zeolites. In the first part, hydrothermal growth was performed without organic template molecules, which resulted in template-free zeolite films and membranes. The samples were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-ray Powder Diffraction and permeation measurements with gaseous probe molecules. Thin films of FAU-type zeolite were prepared on polished single crystals. The thickness and morphology of the films could be controlled by varying the synthesis conditions. Preparation of LTA-type membranes was also attempted. However, the membranes cracked during drying at temperatures above room temperature. Template free MFI membranes with higher quality could be prepared. These membranes had a maximum separation factor alpha of 17. 8 at 220 °C for a n-butane/i-butane mixture. Cracks formed at temperatures higher than 250 °C. Crack formation in zeolite membranes at high temperatures has also been reported by several other groups. Since no model for the crack formation process {{has been established in}} the literature, the second part of this work was devoted to study crack formation and to develop a model. Relatively thick (ca 1800 nm) <b>alpha-alumina</b> supported MFI films, prepared using organic template molecules (TPA+), were selected for the study since data on crack formation in the form of SEM images and permeation measurements for these membranes had been obtained in earlier work by the group. These membranes were further studied by in-situ High Temperature X-ray Powder Diffraction experiments in the present work. In addition, MFI powder and a blank <b>alpha-alumina</b> support were also investigated. Data were collected {{with the aid of a}} Synchrotron radiation facility as well as with a conventional laboratory instrument for the temperature cycle 25 - 500 - 25 °C. The Rietveld method was used to determine the unit cell parameters of MFI and <b>alpha-alumina</b> as well as the TPA+ occupancy of MFI. The out-of- plane strain (i. e. strain in the direction perpendicular to the film surface) in the film and the support was calculated. In addition, the microstructure of the support was investigated by pattern decomposition and Williamson-Hall plots. In agreement with previous reports in the literature, it was found that the TPA-MFI structure contracts as a consequence of template removal and possibly also a structure intrinsic mechanism and the <b>alpha-alumina</b> support expands. Hence, a large thermal expansion mismatch occurs in the membranes during heating. An overall out- of-plane compressive strain was observed for the MFI film during heating, which indicates an in-plane tensile stress (i. e. in the direction parallel to the film surface) in the film. This result was explained by the larger expansion of the support, compared to the film. The <b>alpha-alumina</b> support was also found to be under an overall out-of-plane compressive strain at non-ambient temperatures, presumably due to zeolite in the pores of the support. The microstrain for the MFI coated <b>alpha-alumina</b> support increased during heating, and remained during cooling, which indicate the formation of structural defects in the support. Based on these results and results from earlier work, a model for crack formation was proposed: In the thick films (ca 1800 nm) studied in the present work, the crystals are well intergrown. During heating, the MFI crystals contracts and the alpha- alumina support expands. Consequently, a thermal stress develops in the composite which eventually leads to formation of cracks. In addition, part of the stress is also released via formation of structural defects in the <b>alpha-alumina</b> support. In thinner films (ca 500 nm), the crystals are less well intergrown and the thermal expansion mismatch between the crystals in the film and the support leads to opening of grain boundaries in the film rather than cracks.

40|$|Abstract. High {{temperature}} {{oxidation resistance}} of alumina-forming materials {{is connected to}} the growth of dense, stable and protective alumina scales. Depending on temperature, impurities present in the base alloys, presence of water vapour in the oxidizing atmosphere, the alumina scales are composed of <b>alpha-alumina</b> (which is the stable phase obtained for temperatures over 1000 °C) or of transient alumina (γ,θ,δ obtained for lower temperatures). It is generally considered that γ-Al 2 O 3 grows when T< 850 °C, that θ-Al 2 O 3 is present for 850 °C<T< 1000 °C and that α-Al 2 O 3 is stable when T exceeds 1000 °C. The exact role played by transient alumina formation and/or transformation on the high temperature performances of alumina-forming materials is not exactly defined. Many works proposed that transient alumina phases grew during the first steps of the oxidation process and transformed into the stable phase after further oxidation. The transformation of transient phases in the stable alpha-phase is generally accompanied by a volume contraction of around 14 %. In order to get better oxidation resistance, the formation of transient alumina is not wished, because: 1) their growth rate is generally higher than that of <b>alpha-alumina</b> with, as a consequence, a huge Al consumption, detrimental for the material resistance after long exposures, 2) the change in volum...|$|E
40|$|Restricted until 14 Aug. 2009. Ceramics are {{important}} engineering materials for their outstanding hardness. One {{of the most}} widely used ceramics is alumina, a candidate for armor in defense and aerospace industry. Deformation and fracture mechanisms in <b>alpha-alumina</b> under hypervelocity impact up to 18 km/s are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations containing 540 -million atoms. Impacting projectile causes melting and local amorphization of the substrate in a spherical surrounding region. Away from the impact face, a wide range of deformations emerge and disappear under the influence of local stress fields, e. g., basal and pyramidal slips, basal and rhombohedral twins, which show good agreement with the experimental and theoretical results. Furthermore, new deformation modes such as twin along { 0 - 111 } are observed, and the relation between deformation patterns and local stress levels are probed. During unloading, micro-cracks nucleate extensively at the intersections of previous deformations. These micro-cracks grow and coalesce to form fractures under tensile stresses by the unloading wave. The substrate eventually fails along the surface of an hourglass-shaped region, when spallation ejects clusters of substrate material into the vacuum. We also carried out planar shock simulations of <b>alpha-alumina</b> single crystal and nanophase systems. The results show correlations between the atomistic deformation mechanisms and the elastic-plastic response of ceramic material observed in shock loading experiments...|$|E
40|$|A model {{based on}} Rayleigh-Gans-Debye light {{scattering}} {{theory has been}} developed to describe the light transmission properties of fine-grained, fully dense polycrystalline ceramics consisting of birefringent crystals. This model extends light transmission models based on geometrical optics, which are only valid for coarse-grained microstructures, to smaller crystal sizes. We verify our model by measuring the light transmission properties of fully dense (> 99. 99 %) polycrystalline <b>alpha-alumina</b> (PCA) with mean crystal sizes ranging from 60 m down to 0. 3 m. The remarkable transparency exhibited by PCA samples with small crystal sizes (< 2 m) is very well explained by this model...|$|E
40|$|Both <b>alpha-alumina</b> and {{aluminium}} nitride are insulators. They are widely applied as tunnel barriers. On {{the basis of}} first-principles calculations, it is shown here that the conduction band of these two compounds is of fundamentally different origin than generally assumed. The bottom of the conduction band of both compounds is primarily derived from oxygen/nitrogen 3 s states with an admixture of {{a small amount of}} aluminium s character only. The presence of the anion 3 s states is of importance for the size of the band gap: without them they would be significantly larger. The consequences of these differences are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Polycrystalline {{samples of}} <b>alpha-alumina</b> have been {{irradiated}} with various ions ranging from 3. 6 MeV Fe{sup +} to 1 MeV H{sup +} ions at 650 C. Cross-section {{transmission electron microscopy}} was used to investigate the depth-dependent microstructure of the irradiated specimens. The microstructure following irradiation was observed {{to be dependent on}} the irradiation spectrum. In particular, defect cluster nucleation was effectively suppressed in specimens irradiated with light ions such as 1 MeV H{sup +} ions. On the other hand, light ion irradiation tended to accelerate the growth rate of dislocation loops. The microstructural observations are discussed in terms of ionization enhanced diffusion processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{thermolysis}} {{of nickel}} acetylacetonate supported on <b>alpha-alumina</b> {{has been investigated}} by thermal methods (TGA-DTG-DTA), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). At 250 degrees C and in static air atmosphere, decomposition of the metal ligands is nearly complete. Higher temperatures are needed in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. The variation of XPS peak parameters of samples heated at various temperatures between 120 and 900 degrees C has been interpreted as a change {{of the distribution of}} the Ni species between the octahedral and tetrahedral aluminum sites of the support, and a progressive formation of a nickel aluminate-like species, in agreement with temperature-programmed reduction features...|$|E

As part of this work, {{we are looking at}} the mechanical properties of HTSC materials. An important mechanical property which influences the mechanical integrity of the hybrid MCMis the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the HTSC films. As a first step in developing a procedure for the determination of the CTE of HTSC materials, the lattice parameters and the CTE of an <b>alpha-alumina</b> substrate have been determined by powder x-ray diffraction technique. An extension of this technique applicable to HTSC materials is presented...|$|E
