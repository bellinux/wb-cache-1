5|$|Atrus {{calls the}} Stranger {{to his home}} in Tomahna to request his friend's assistance. Atrus is the writer of special books, which serve as links to worlds known as Ages. Twenty years earlier, his two sons, Sirrus and Achenar, {{destroyed}} his library on Myst and trapped their parents in order to plunder the wealth of Atrus' Ages. The Stranger's intervention saved Atrus, who had imprisoned his sons via traps intended for thieves. Atrus' wife Catherine hopes that, after twenty years, they have finally repented for their crimes. Atrus is not <b>as</b> <b>sure</b> his sons have reformed, and so wishes the Stranger to act as an impartial judge. After being knocked unconscious by an explosion, the Stranger realizes that Yeesha, Atrus' daughter, has disappeared.|$|E

25|$|In 2007–08, McManaman {{also got}} {{involved}} with corporate dealings in Hong Kong with companies like Sure Trace Inc, which {{was set up by}} another porn baron and stock market and IT entrepreneur, James MacKay, who transferred two-thirds of the company to him. The company made news for wrong reasons <b>as</b> <b>Sure</b> Trace had made a number of major contract announcements which had not become actual, revenue-generating contracts and was delisted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company then setup True Product ID as a company to conduct technology joint ventures in China and the company was transferred to McManaman. To protect investors, the SEC suspended Sure Trace Security in August 2005, citing the accuracy of public information regarding its technology sales.|$|E

500|$|During {{the late}} 1860s and early 1870s, from within his father's firm in Charing Cross and, by late 1874, {{from a nearby}} address in Craig's Court, Carte began to build an operatic, concert and lecture {{management}} agency. His two hundred clients eventually included Charles Gounod, Jacques Offenbach, Adelina Patti, Mario, Clara Schumann, Antoinette Sterling, Edward Lloyd, Mr. and Mrs. German Reed, George Grossmith, Matthew Arnold, James McNeill Whistler and Oscar Wilde. Hesketh Pearson said of Carte: [...] "His acute business sense was aided by a frank and agreeable manner.... He took what other people thought were risks, but he felt were certainties. He knew everyone worth knowing... and his practical judgement was <b>as</b> <b>sure</b> as his sense of artistry." ...|$|E

500|$|Marshall's wife, Lois, {{was heavily}} {{involved}} in charitable activities in Washington and spent considerable time working at the Diet Kitchen Welfare Center providing free meals to impoverished children. In 1917 she became acquainted with a mother of newborn twins, {{one of whom was}} chronically ill. The child's parents were unable to get adequate treatment for their son's condition. Lois formed a close bond with the baby, who was named Clarence Ignatius Morrison, and offered to take him and help him find treatment. She and Marshall had been unable to have children, and when she brought the baby home, Marshall told that she could [...] "keep him, provided he did not squall". Marshall grew to love the boy and wrote that he [...] "never walked the streets of Washington with <b>as</b> <b>sure</b> a certainty as he walked into my heart", and, as the boy grew older, that he was [...] "beautiful as an angel; brilliant beyond his years; lovable from every standpoint".|$|E
500|$|In early August 1886, Dunlap {{was sold}} to the Detroit Wolverines for $4,700, the most {{expensive}} purchase price at the time. [...] In addition to the sum paid to the Maroons to grant the release, the Detroit team signed a contract to pay Dunlap $4,500 a season for two seasons, with an advance of $1,500 {{on the first day}} of November 1886 and 1887, respectively. [...] The mid-season sale led to concerns about the Maroons: [...] "The transfer of Dunlap to Detroit is a small thing in itself, but its bearing on the entire base ball world is so great as to almost revolutionize the present order of things. [...] He was the king pin of the St. Louis Club and his sale makes a certainty of the dissolution of the Maroons." [...] The Detroit management was praised for their [...] "pluck and enterprise" [...] in making the bold [...] "business stroke." [...] The Sporting News wrote at the time:"Dunlap has joined the Detroits and now that team will fly the League pennant just <b>as</b> <b>sure</b> as time flies and the world grows. [...] From the day the old St. Louis Union team went out of existence Dunlap has been anything but a favorite in St. Louis. [...] Still there was no one in the world but was willing to concede that he was the greatest second baseman America has ever known." ...|$|E

2500|$|Biblical patriarchy as {{expressed}} by the Vision Forum is similar to Complementarianism in that it affirms the equality of men and women, but goes further in its expression of the different gender roles. Many {{of the differences between}} them are ones of degree and emphasis. While Complementarianism holds to exclusively male leadership in the church and in the home, biblical patriarchy extends that exclusion to the civic sphere as well, so that women should not be civil leaders and indeed should not have careers outside the home. Thus, William Einwechter refers to the traditional Complementarian view as [...] "two point complementarianism" [...] (male leadership in the family and church), and regards the biblical patriarchy view as [...] "three-point" [...] or [...] "full" [...] complementarianism, (male leadership in family, church and society). In contrast to this, John Piper and Wayne Grudem, representing the Complementarian position, say that they are [...] "not <b>as</b> <b>sure</b> in this wider sphere which roles can be carried out by men or women". Grudem also acknowledges exceptions to the submission of wives to husbands where moral issues are involved.|$|E
2500|$|Modern primality {{tests for}} general numbers n {{can be divided}} into two main classes, {{probabilistic}} (or [...] "Monte Carlo") and deterministic algorithms. Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. [...] For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. [...] Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. [...] For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. [...] If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be <b>as</b> <b>sure</b> as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. [...] On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite.|$|E
2500|$|One {{commentator}} {{has said}} that the exterior of the Cathedral is probably the most complete and consistent of all Petre's churches. [...] "The majesty of the dome is best seen from the rear, and from most parts of the city it registers powerfully above the Christchurch flatness in a manner reminiscent of Brunelleschi's dome in Florence". George Bernard Shaw during his 1934 visit was unimpressed with Gilbert Scott's Anglican cathedral but generous in his praise of Petre's Catholic one. [...] "In fact it was Shaw {{who was one of the}} first to open local eyes to the quality of this building." [...] In 1970 under Bishop Ashby, [...] "years of grime deposited from the [...] nearby railway station and gasworks were cleaned off and restoration work was carried out." [...] "The great joy of the cathedral, however, is the interior. Petre's handling of natural light is <b>as</b> <b>sure</b> as ever, the nave and sanctuary are suffused with daylight. The [...] fine Corinthian and Ionic columns down each side of the nave are a development of the design of St Patrick's Basilica, Oamaru, here doubled in height, for obviously single columns in this great nave would have required enormous girth. The sanctuary dome is undoubtedly the climax of the interior; it is here that the full power of the design is unleashed. This was Petre's finest achievement in forty years of practice. Fascinating vistas are gained through the arches which transmit the enormous weight of the dome to the four massive piers. These are decorated with subtle flutings, a fresh variation on an ancient theme. In this sanctuary the liturgy can be seen as drama and it receives a fitting setting for its movement and colour".|$|E
