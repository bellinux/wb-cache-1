40|$|UV nanoimprint {{lithography}} (UV NIL) is attracting {{more and more}} interest, because of its potential to become a high-resolution, low-cost patterning technique. To establish UV NIL as a low-cost patterning technique, the costs of single templates, today obtained from 6025 quartz mask blanks, have to be reduced and the life-time of the antisticking layers has to be optimized. Within this work, a process flow was de-veloped to obtain 49 UV nanoimprint templates with a dimension of 12. 5 × 12. 5 mm² out of a fused silica substrate with a diameter of 150 mm. After sawing, etching, and cleaning, the template surfaces were covered with an <b>antisticking</b> <b>layer.</b> Next, the templates were glued onto a template holder to enable their handling with the nanoimprint tool NPS 300 from Süss MicroTec. With this process flow, the prize of one single template was strongly reduced compared to quartz templates obtained from 6025 quartz mask blanks. In addition, the life-time of antisticking layers was investigated. For this purpose, the change of the surface tension of antisticking layers after {{an increasing number of}} imprints into different UV curing materials was measured and the best combination of <b>antisticking</b> <b>layer</b> and UV curing material was figured out. Finally, silicon substrates were patterned with the optimized template...|$|E
40|$|A new {{ultraviolet}} assisted {{nanoimprint lithography}} technique with an exposure through non-transparent molds and a nm-resolution capability is reported. The UV imprint material was not cured by direct irradiation, but substantially exposed to indirect and diffuse irradiation. The nanoimprint molds {{consisted of a}} transparent support and a non-transparent, patterned element. Successful imprints were conducted on transparent glass and polymer foils placed on non-transparent substrate holders {{as well as on}} SiO 2 on Si. The reported technique enables the application of non-transparent mold materials like Si, new mold materials and alternative <b>antisticking</b> <b>layers</b> like metals in UV-NIL...|$|R
40|$|Combined nanoimprint and {{photolithography}} (CNP) is {{an attractive}} imprint technology for residual layer free direct patterning of high aspect ratio polymer structures. Employing the chromium hard mask from the imprint mold etching process as a light blocking metal layer {{on top of the}} imprint mold protrusions is an efficient manufacturing method for CNP molds. The surface chemistry of the mold and in particular of the chromium layer is crucial for the realization of <b>antisticking</b> <b>layers</b> (ASLs) on suchlike CNP molds. For the reported ASL coatings, the stripping process of the electron beam resist was very important, especially for fluorinated resists. We compared an antireflective chromium photomask surface with the standard imprint mold materials Si (native oxide), SiO 2 (thermal oxide) and quartz. Low surface free energies of ~ 15. 3 mN/m and ~ 10. 9 mN/m were achieved by chemical vapor deposition of 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (FDTS) for the chromium surface and the natively oxidized Si, respectively. The ASLs were successfully tested on unstructured chromium imprint molds without sticking problems during imprinting...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we will report on the {{development}} of a process to establish <b>antisticking</b> <b>layers</b> on nickel-based stamps, which are used in several industrial applications of nanoimprint lithography or related methods. The fluorinated alkyl silane films have been deposited onto different Ni-based stamp surfaces in order to minimize the adhesion tendency at the stamp/polymer interface. film thickness, chemical composition, purity, and binding mechanisms of the silane groups to different stamp surface materials have been determined by photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the case of electroplated nickel stamps-where low imprint qualities are observed-multilayer thick films cover, the stamp surfaces, consisting of polymerized, cross-linked alkyl silanes, which are poorly bound to the surface. In order to overcome these restrictions a. 100 angstrom thick polycrystalline titanium layer has been established in a sandwich position between the nickel substrate and the silane film. Here, silane film thicknesses in the monomolecular region together with evidences for strong covalent linkage between the silane groups and the oxidized Ti surface can be concluded from the XPS results, leading to film properties and imprint qualities, which are comparable to those formerly observed for silicon stamps...|$|R
