He is primarily a defensive midfielder, reportedly priding himself on [...] "ball-winning ground-covering defensive midfield work"; his major contribution to his team comes from [...] "flying around midfield winning the ball and disrupting the opposition". Lee Clark suggested he looks best when using his power and strength and keeping {{his use of the}} ball simple. Dean Saunders mentioned his [...] "winning mentality"; according to the Birmingham Mail Brian Dick, [...] "when Blues are down no-one leads by example quite as much as Davis".|$|E

[...] Gittins added that he had received emails from the USN as recently as the week before urging Waddle not to make the trip. [...] Gittins stated that the reason that it took two years for Waddle to make the trip to Japan was because Waddle was forbidden to do so while he was still in the USN and because of financial constraints and fear of litigation after his retirement.|$|E

500|$|Listed as a left wing, Breslin {{was capable}} of playing all three forward positions, an ability which gave his coaches {{flexibility}} and allowed him to play in any situation. Not a big player, standing six feet tall weighing 180 pounds, he played a gritty, physical, brand of hockey primary in a checking line role. As a checker it was his responsibility {{to shut down the}} opposition and keep them from scoring, emphasizing defense over offense. Because of his versatility and role, he was often a member of his team's penalty killing unit. Breslin was known for his team-first attitude and willingness to do whatever was asked of him in order to help the team succeed. Former Wolves General Manager Kevin Cheveldayoff said of Breslin, [...] "You could always count on Tim to come and compete every night <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> was needed for the team to win". Not the most talented of players, Breslin's work ethic helped him to be a better player. Head coach Anderson once stated, [...] "He is the kind of player who maybe isn't in the very upper echelon in skill factor, but his dedication and hard work make up for that." ...|$|E

[...] She has said that riding [...] "saved my life", explaining that, [...] "I was losing most of the function of my right side. And I decided I needed to go back <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I loved before I couldn't do it anymore." [...] At first she could barely stay on a horse without getting tired, but gradually the muscle control required for riding proved directly beneficial, and psychologically, [...] "Riding exhilarated me; it gave me a joy and a purpose. When I was so fatigued that I couldn't move, the excitement of going to the barn and getting my foot in the stirrup would make me crawl out of bed." [...] As a result, she said, [...] "My desire to ride was, and is, so strong that I kept getting healthier and healthier." ...|$|E

In her eighties {{she was still}} playing tennis regularly, as indicated in her 1993 documentary All About Me. She also enjoyed painting, which became a passion later in life. When questioned about politics, Hepburn told an interviewer, [...] "I always just say be on the affirmative and liberal side. Don't be a 'no' person." [...] The anti-Communist attitude in 1940s Hollywood prompted her to political activity, as she joined the Committee for the First Amendment. Her name was mentioned at the hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee but Hepburn denied being a Communist sympathizer. Later in life, she openly promoted birth control and supported abortion. She practiced Albert Schweitzer's theory of [...] "Reverence for Life", but {{did not believe in}} religion or the afterlife. In 1991, Hepburn told a journalist, [...] "I'm an atheist, and that's it. I believe there's nothing we can know except that we should be kind to each other <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> we can for other people." [...] Her public declarations of these beliefs led the American Humanist Association to award her the Humanist Arts Award in 1985.|$|E

500|$|Members {{from the}} Rainmen profusely criticized the {{brutality}} of the Express throughout the series as well. Kevin Young was told {{by some of the}} Windsor players that their coach had told them to [...] "take out" [...] him, Liam McMorrow and Fisher. Cliff Clinkscales said, [...] "There's a difference between playing physical and dirty and hurting people." [...] Halifax entered Game 7 with two players out with concussions they suffered in the series itself. Clinkscales also played with injured ribs. Despite this, Levingston attempted to convince the players to play without their coaches, who favored forfeiting it. He also offered the Rainmen new coaches, a raised salary, and $1,000, but to no avail. Haywood said, [...] "How could we play without coach, bringing another coach in? <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>what?</b> Coach us? He doesn't even know us." [...] Levingston, on the other hand, slammed Clarós, saying that [...] "instead of leading our team to the championship, he led a group of talented players to broken contracts and a lifetime of controversy." [...] The owner claimed that he felt cheated and that the players were misled by their coaches. He took full responsibility for leading the Rainmen into the WFCU Centre ahead of schedule but believed that the two teams could have negotiated to avoid conflict.|$|E
500|$|Talk of {{a reunion}} {{commenced}} {{weeks after the}} trio began speaking again. After a two-hour phone conversation between DeLonge and Hoppus, an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker's Los Angeles studio in October 2008. DeLonge {{was the first to}} approach the subject of reuniting. The trio had, in Hoppus's words, [...] "two gnarly heart-to-hearts," [...] during which the three opened up. [...] "Tom had just kind of come out to Los Angeles for the day," [...] recalled Hoppus, [...] "I remember he said, 'So, what do you guys think? Where are your heads at?' And I said, 'I think we should continue with what we've been doing for the past 17 years.

[...] Eventually, the band appeared {{for the first time on}} stage together in nearly five years as presenters at the 51st Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009. The band's official website was updated with a statement: [...] "To put it simply, We're back. We mean, really back. Picking up where we left off and then some.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Can't Be Tamed"' was {{directed}} by Robert Hales. The dance routines were choreographed by Jamal Sims, who also choreographed Cyrus' [...] "Hoedown Throwdown". Cyrus and Sims conceived the plot for the video together and proposed it to Hales, who [...] "envisioned it the way [...] did". In regards to the video's theme, Cyrus explained, [...] "I think the video explains my life but it doesn't exclude other people's lives. It's not just about how fabulous and glamorous and all this. It's about the core of 'I don't wanna be in a cage. I want to be free <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I love'". The video was meant to transition Cyrus away from the good-girl image she had developed through Hannah Montana. However, she believed her fans {{would be able to}} identify with the video's message through their own circumstances; for example, she believed that her desire to [...] "stand out [...] than fit in" [...] was shared by teenagers hoping to break out of high school cliques. In an interview with the singer, Ryan Seacrest noted the video's strong sexual appeal. Cyrus agreed that the video was sexy, though it was not supposed to be the premise: [...] "The video isn't about being sexy or who can wear the less clothes [...] It's about explaining the song and living the lyrics." [...] The music video has been viewed over 100 million times on vevo.|$|E

[...] Chris Willman from Yahoo! compared the song to Gaga's [...] "Telephone", where Knowles appears as a featured artist, and wrote that [...] "Maybe it's because the lack of a video for Gaga's [...] "Telephone" [...] leaves more to the imagination, but if this were a contest, I'd have to say her tune trumps Beyoncé's.

500|$|The {{third round}} draw for the FA Cup paired Argyle with Newcastle United, which left {{assistant}} manager John Carver with mixed emotions. Neither side could break the deadlock {{in a competitive}} contest at Home Park. Argyle striker Rory Fallon forced a good save from Tim Krul before the visitors had chances of their own, the majority of which went to Fabrice Pancrate. Newcastle looked likely {{to win the game}} late on but were denied by goalkeeper Romain Larrieu, who tipped a looping volley from Nicky Butt over the crossbar. The match saw the return of Chris Barker to the Argyle defence after a lengthy spell on the sidelines because of injury, and manager Paul Mariner was full of praise for his performance. [...] "For him to come <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> he did against such a high powered, attacking team as Newcastle and playing 90 plus minutes was pretty remarkable. He's a very strong character and very experienced." [...] The replay at St James' Park was Argyle's next match due to the wintry weather, and they were on the wrong end of a 3–0 scoreline. Newcastle striker Peter Løvenkrands gave the home side a two-goal lead at half-time and completed his hat-trick after 72 minutes. [...] "His timing of his runs is pretty special and for the first goal, his finish was fantastic," [...] said Mariner. The match on Tyneside was to be the last in an Argyle shirt for Cillian Sheridan who returned to Celtic in Scotland the next day when his loan spell with the club finished, having made 13 appearances, scoring no goals.|$|E

Danja explained that the creative process was not difficult at first since he was [...] "left to do pretty much whatever I wanted to", and [...] "if she felt it, she was gonna ride with it. If she didn't, you'd see it in her face." [...] Hilson wrote [...] "Gimme More" [...] with Spears in mind after Danja played her the instrumental, saying, [...] "I just started singing, 'Give me, Give me' and added a little more in and just having fun and messing around really." [...] Spears began recording with them at Studio at the Palms in Las Vegas in August 2006, while she was seven months pregnant with Jayden James. Recording continued at Spears' house in Los Angeles, three weeks after she gave birth. Hilson commented that [...] "She gave 150 percent. [...] I don't know any other mother that would do that."
