5|$|But within minutes, the Do 17 {{formation}} {{had been}} reduced to 15 aircraft and most of them were damaged. Six had been shot down and four were attempting to make <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> home. The remainder dropped their bombs and were met by a covering force of Bf 109s and landed back in France without further combat. LG 2 meanwhile had been and gone. They saw one rail station and released their bombs and returned home. They saw only one British fighter, No. 46 Squadron’s Pilot Officer Gunning who reported the make up of the formation. Park had decided to ignore their raid.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Combs {{appointed}} Clements {{as state}} highway commissioner. Some state newspapers charged that Clements had demanded this {{post at the}} head of the state's largest executive department in exchange for supporting Combs, a charge Combs denied. Others wondered if Clements took the post in order to organize the state political machinery for his friend Lyndon Johnson, who was rumored to be considering <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> president. Still others believed that, from his powerful post, Clements would be the real governor and Combs only a puppet.|$|E

5|$|In October 2015, The Boston Globe first {{reported}} that Wolf was considering {{not running for}} re-election. Weeks later in November, Wolf confirmed that he would remain in office, but would not seek re-election in 2016. Wolf's political aspirations were prodded shortly after handily winning re-election in 2014, though {{he said he was}} more focused on serving his constituents than considering future office. After rumors that Wolf would not seek re-election in 2016 in order to focus on <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> governor in 2018 began circulating, Senate President Stan Rosenberg suggested it was because Wolf wanted to focus more on running his airline company.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination, but President Arthur was contemplating <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> election in his own right. George Edmunds was again the favored candidate among reformers and John Sherman had a few delegates pledged to him, but neither was expected to command much support at the convention. John A. Logan of Illinois hoped to attract Stalwart votes if Arthur’s campaign was unsuccessful. Blaine was unsure he wanted to try for the nomination for the third time and even encouraged General William T. Sherman, John Sherman’s older brother, to accept it if it came to him, but ultimately Blaine agreed to be a candidate again.|$|E

5|$|Undeterred, Sanford began {{preparations}} {{two years}} later for <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination.

While he developed a following among educators, {{he did not have}} a satisfactory campaign theme by the new year. Then, while campaigning in Massachusetts in January, he suffered sharp pains and was diagnosed with a heart murmur.

Alabama responded with a 20-yard touchdown run on a reverse by Whitey Blanchiak to take a 12–6 halftime lead. In the third quarter, the Informals extended their lead to 24–6 after Lowell Edmondson scored on a 35-yard touchdown pass from Greer and on a four-yard Frank MacAlpine touchdown run in the third quarter.

5|$|As {{the pairs}} go their {{separate}} ways, an enforcer for the loan shark {{catches up with}} the duplicated pair {{to get the money}} back and they discover they have no cash. The enforcer orders Brian to decide whether he kills him or Stewie. Brian initially refuses to choose but when he panics, he tells the enforcer to shoot Stewie in the head, killing him, then the enforcer tells Brian to give him the money he and Stewie borrowed and leaves the room. Meanwhile, the real pair worry about getting caught Stewie suggest that they make <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> it and head home, but Brian fears it will endanger the family. Stewie suggests that perhaps they should kill themselves and Brian reluctantly agrees. They prepare to throw themselves off the top balcony of the hotel but Stewie chickens out at the last second, leaving Brian to fall to his death. A panic-stricken Stewie trips over his backpack and finds the money the other pair had won.|$|E
5|$|Contemplating {{advocacy}} {{work and}} <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> city council in Newark after graduation from law school, Booker {{lived in the}} city during his final year at Yale. After graduation, he served as staff attorney for the Urban Justice Center in New York and program coordinator of the Newark Youth Project. In 1998, Booker won an upset victory for a seat on the Newark City Council, defeating four-term incumbent George Branch. To draw attention to the problems of open-air drug dealing and associated violence, he went on a 10-day hunger strike and lived in a tent and later in a motor home near drug-dealing areas of the city. Booker proposed council initiatives that impacted housing, young people, law and order, and the efficiency and transparency of city hall, but was regularly outvoted by all of his fellow councilors.|$|E

5|$|Despite having {{previously}} {{shown little}} inclination toward politics, Brown surprised political observers by declaring his candidacy {{for governor in}} 1979. With the state and nation facing difficult economic times, Brown promised to run the state government like a business. A strong media campaign funded by his personal fortune allowed him to win the Democratic primary {{and go on to}} defeat former Republican governor Louie B. Nunn in the general election. Because he owed few favors to established political leaders, he appointed many successful businesspeople to state posts instead of making political appointments. Following through on his campaign promise to make more diverse appointments, he named a woman and an African-American to his cabinet. During his tenure, Brown exerted less influence over the legislature than previous governors and was frequently absent from the state, leaving lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins as acting governor for more than one quarter of his term. He briefly considered <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> the U.S. Senate after his gubernatorial term, but withdrew from the race after only three weeks, citing health issues. He has continued to invest in business ventures, the most high profile of which was Kenny Rogers Roasters, a wood-roasted chicken restaurant he founded with country music star Kenny Rogers.|$|E
5|$|Discharged {{from the}} army, Willkie {{returned}} to Elwood. He considered <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> Congress as a Democrat, but was advised {{that the district}} was so Republican he {{would be unlikely to}} keep the seat even if he could win it, and his chances might be better in a more urban area. Herman Willkie wanted Wendell and Robert to rejoin the family law firm, but Henrietta was opposed, feeling that opportunities in Elwood were too limited for her sons. She got her way, and in May 1919 Wendell Willkie successfully applied for a job with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio as head of the legal office that advised workers on wills and other personal matters. He was soon bored there, and on the advice of his wife, left for a law firm despite an offer from Harvey Firestone to double his salary. Firestone told the departing lawyer that he would never amount to anything because he was a Democrat.|$|E
5|$|During {{his service}} as {{lieutenant}} governor, Beshear formed and chaired the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a privately financed group assembled {{to make recommendations}} for the state's future growth and development. The 30-person commission was formed in July 1984 and presented its report – containing more than 100 recommendations – in September 1986. Among the recommendations in the commission's report were several changes to the state constitution, adopted in 1891. The recommended changes included eliminating the offices of state treasurer, {{secretary of state and}} superintendent of public instruction, holding elections only in odd-numbered years instead of every year, and raising the term limit for the state's constitutional officers from one term to two consecutive terms. The state legislature showed little interest in calling a constitutional convention, however, and the commission's recommendations were not immediately adopted, though several have since been implemented. Other recommendations in the commission's report included the creation of lifelong learning programs, implementation of criminal justice reforms, and improvements in worker training. The commission was hailed by some as the most substantial undertaking by a lieutenant governor to date, but was panned by others as a move by Beshear to better position himself for <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> governor in 1987.|$|E

5|$|Harrison lost {{a bid for}} Senate in 1831, {{and found}} {{insufficient}} support to mount <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> the House of Representatives in 1832. His large family gave him money problems, and he remained out of public life in the early 1830s. By 1834, opposition to President Jackson was coalescing into {{what became known as}} the Whig Party. Harrison, though several years out of active politics was a war hero with roots in both North and South, and had been fired by Jackson. Thus, he looked attractive as a possible presidential candidate to the new party, something that Harrison did nothing to discourage. Harrison wrote a letter to the newspapers that won over many Whigs, assuring them of his fidelity to party principles, such as the limited power of the executive and federal subsidies for roads, canals and railroads.|$|E
5|$|Having {{left his}} command to General Belliard on 8 March, three days later, Nansouty {{was a part}} of a convoy of several officers, heading to Paris. On the road to the capital, they were {{attacked}} by a pulk of Cossacks, which managed to disperse the convoy's escort. Nansouty and his officers fought their way out sabre in hand and made <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> it towards the river Aisne. Reaching the riverbanks, the General got isolated and, as he was preparing to cross the river on horseback, his horse was shot under him, throwing the General to the ground. Nevertheless, he stood up and swam to the other bank of the river and safety. This event, as well as his tireless activity during the campaign, seem to suggest that his health was not the main reason of his departure from the army. It is also unlikely that the Emperor himself decided to replace him, given Belliard's tentative approach at the Battle of Craonne and this General's subsequent provisional status as commander, after Nansouty's departure. It is thus more likely that Nansouty resigned, following his disputes with the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{received}} the ball first, with Mike Massey returning the Julian Rauch kick to the Michigan 33-yard line. Michigan gained {{a first down}} after converting a third and one with a three-yard run by Mike Hart. Chad Henne then completed an 18-yard pass to Massey, followed by a 33-yard rush from Hart, pushing Michigan to the four-yard line of Appalachian State. Hart then ran the ball in for a touchdown, and the ensuing extra point made the score 7–0. Appalachian State's CoCo Hillary took the kickoff to the 26-yard line of the Mountaineers. After the Mountaineers opened with <b>a</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> no gain and a six-yard completion, Armanti Edwards completed a 68-yard touchdown pass to Dexter Jackson. The extra point was converted, tying the score at 7–7. The following two drives resulted in three-and-outs for both teams, but after a Mountaineer punt went out of bounds at the Michigan 48-yard line, the Wolverines mounted a ten-play, 52-yard drive culminating in a ten-yard touchdown pass from Henne to Greg Matthews. The extra point gave Michigan a 14–7 lead. Appalachian State started their drive with 3:09 left in the quarter at their own 35-yard line, completing nine plays and driving to the Michigan 36yard-line {{before the end of}} the quarter.|$|E
