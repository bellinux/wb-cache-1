40|$|We {{investigate}} whether size and book-to-market values of equity are proxying for macroeconomic risks found in Chen, Roll, <b>and</b> <b>Ross's</b> multifactor model or are measures of stocks' risk exposure to relative distress. We {{find that the}} role of size subsumes stocks' risk exposures associated with the Chen, Roll, <b>and</b> <b>Ross's</b> factors <b>and</b> that the Chen, Roll, <b>and</b> <b>Ross's</b> multifactor model does not explain the book-to-market values of equity effect. We also find that size and book-to-market values of equity are related to relative distress and that relative distress can explain the size effect, but only partially the effect of book-to-market values of equity, on average stock returns.
