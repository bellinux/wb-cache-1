40|$|In {{this paper}} the rift between Jevons and Mill over {{the method of}} polit-ical economy serves as a {{prehistory}} to recent attempts of behavioural economists to once again explain economic behaviour by taking recourse to mankind’s physiology. While Mill relied on the association psychology and its introspective method to establish indubitable first principles, Jevons scorned all recourse to introspection. As exemplified for Jevons’s theory of labour, psychophysiology gave Jevons the means to think about economic behaviour in terms of functional form, and promised its assess-ment by means of experiments. Thus levelling down the Victorian dis-tinction between mind and matter, Jevons turned political economy into social physics.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston University This {{item was}} {{digitized}} by the Internet Archive. The thesis consists, in the main, of a laboratory manual in pharmaceutical physics adaptei primarily {{to satisfy the}} requirements of pharmacy students. It includes thirty-two experiments dealing with the preneral topics of mechanics, heat, electricity, and optics, those divisions of the science of physics which constitute a major portion of the fundamental physical concepts which are basic to the various sciences which comprise the pharmaceutical curriculum. More specifically, the series of experiments deals with such topics as methods of measurement, specific gravity, surface tension, viscosity, solution and solubility curves, dialysis and osmosis, absorption and adsorption, thermometry, distillation, boiling point determination, melting point determination, the gas laws, electrolysis, micrometry, colorimetry, polarimetry, spectra, and phase-testing of emulsions, topics vhlch are pharmaceutically significant since they form the basis for the comprehensive understanding of the many processes and operations encountered in the study and practice of pharmacy. Emphasis has been placed on the correlation of the basic principles and fundamental laws with specific pharmaceutical applications of these concepts. To this end, a comment on the pharmaceutical application of the principle or law which an experiment is intended to illustrate has been included, in most instances, in the introduction to the experiment. A statement of the purpose of the experiment, a list of the <b>apparatus</b> <b>and</b> <b>materials</b> required for performing the experiment, a theoretical introduction, working directions including photographs and diagrams of the <b>apparatus,</b> <b>and</b> questions and exercises of a pharmaceutically significant character comprise the data which have been compiled for the experiments included in the laboratory manual...|$|R

40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (EngD), at Loughborough University. Pavement foundations for major roads in the UK were historically designed on an empirical basis, related to a single design chart, restricting the incorporation of superior performing materials or materials for which the empirical data sets were not available. The adoption of performance based specifications was promoted as they are perceived to ‘open up’ the use of alternative materials (including ‘local’ sources of primary <b>materials)</b> or techniques, <b>and</b> allow for the incorporation of superior performance into the overall pavement design. Parallel developments to the performance based design of pavement foundations (allowing for superior performance) and in situ testing required the support of laboratory based performance tests. These laboratory based tests were required to determine material performance parameters (elastic modulus and resistance to permanent deformation) for both unbound and hydraulically bound pavement foundation materials. A review of the available laboratory apparatus {{indicated that they were}} either; unrealistic (and hence unable to provide the required material performance parameters), or overly complex and more suited to fundamental research. Therefore, the requirement for developmental research work was identified. The research reported herein details the development, manufacture and initial evaluation of simplified laboratory apparatus (the Springbox for unbound <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> static stiffness test for hydraulically bound mixtures) designed to produce the performance parameters of elastic modulus and relative resistance to permanent deformation for pavement foundation <b>materials.</b> The equipment <b>and</b> test procedure evaluation was undertaken across a range of materials, giving initial guidance on likely in situ performance. The innovative laboratory <b>apparatus</b> <b>and</b> <b>materials</b> guidance (including the potential to use recycled and secondary aggregates) was incorporated into key Highways Agency specification and guidance documents, which in turn influence construction practice outside of motorways and major trunk roads. This research concludes by outlining a number of recommendations for continued development and evaluation, including feeding back data sets from long term in situ performance testing for subsequent refinement of assumptions...|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{discusses the}} theoretical framework and methodology behind a recent (2012) body of artwork. The {{work is the}} result of a three month research sabbatical from The University of Huddersfield that investigates the narratives, processes, rituals <b>and</b> <b>apparatus</b> of the sport of open water swimming with a focus on the ‘cult’ of channel swimming, in particular the necessity for learned behaviours, collective interaction and the identity of the channel swimmer. ‘Interaction amongst peers can lead to an excessive commitment to action’ (Hughes and Coakley 1991) The work combines both object based sculpture, photography, drawing and films that utilise an experiential approach to the research of the sport by a direct involvement. Documentary processes and re-enactment are engaged, with myself as subject of the study in the video series Acclimatisation (2012). The piece documents the body’s physical response to cold-water immersion and the method of acclimatising (habituation) over a set period of time, a process that is core to channel swimming training. This piece in particular reflects aspects of ‘positive deviant’ behaviour (Ewald and Jiobu, 1985) where there is an over commitment to extending the action (Hughes and Coakley 1991) undertaken by extreme athletes. Links between practices of endurance art and acclimatisation are described. Sandettie Lightship (2012) Shipping Lane (2012) and Standard Relay (2012) are part of a series of sculptural photographs and film made from the same <b>apparatus</b> <b>and</b> <b>materials</b> that channel swimmers use to feed during a swim. The repetitive time-based behaviour of ‘the feed’ and how it is administered is part of the learned channel swimmer behaviour and the self-made feeding constructions become an essential object within the performance of the swim. The constructed sculptures become semi abstract, retaining traces of their function but are further distanced and transposed from their origin as a channel swimming feeder via the medium of film, the editing of which reflects the time-based measuring of the duration of a swim. The series Channel Swimwear Rules (2012) consists of self-portraits of the swimmer wearing all the equipment disallowed when swimming the channel, researching the relationship between the authentic body and the use of technology to enhance performance...|$|R

The spray planting <b>apparatus</b> <b>and</b> <b>materials</b> have been continuously ameliorated and invented. In this study, Polisoil {{was chosen as the}} tested specimen. Five different concentrations of polisoil (0 %, 1. 63 %, 2. 13 %, 2. 63 %, 3. 13 %) were sprayed on laterite, and Bermuda grass and Taiwan Acacia were chosen as the experimental plants. The rainfall simulator was applied to measure the soil erosion under different concentration treatments. The germination rate of Bermuda grass and Taiwan Acacia of Polisoil with different polisoil concentration treatments was also measured. The soil properties of different treatments were measured also. The results are summarized as following: 1. The pH, mean diameter of aggregates and water holding capacity of laterite will increase with the raising concentration of Polisoil, however, the saturated hydraulic conductivity did not change significantly. 2. The erosion of laterite, the germination percentage and the germination potential of plants will decrease with raising concentration of Polisoil. The best concentration of Polisoil was found to be 2. 13 %, which will control the soil erosion and will not inhibit the seed germination. 噴植工法之引進與應用迄今有近三十年，目前噴植機具與噴植材料仍持續在改良與研發中。本研究選取土壤團粒化劑為試驗材料，調配 1. 63 ％、 2. 13 ％、 2. 63 ％、 3. 13 ％與對照組 0 ％等五種濃度配比，並以百慕達草、相思樹為供試植物，進行噴附後之土壤物理、沖蝕與種子發芽試驗，探討不同濃度的土壤團粒化劑對紅土保護功效與植物初期生長影響，期能提供此工法於施工設計與種子材料應用之參考。茲將結果摘要如下： 1. 土壤團粒化劑施用於紅土，噴附濃度愈高，土壤pH值、幾何平均粒徑隨之增大，且於低基質張力（ 0 ∼ 2 bar）時，保水性亦提高，但對飽和水力傳導度無顯著影響。 2. 經種子發芽與模擬降雨沖蝕試驗得知，土壤團粒化劑濃度越高，則紅土抗沖蝕性愈佳，種子發芽率與發芽勢愈低。土壤團粒化劑噴植於B處理（ 2. 13 ％）下，對於紅土沖蝕控制與植物種子發芽情形均能達到其成效，應屬較佳之施工濃度配比。對於土壤沖蝕嚴重之地區可選擇大於B處理之濃度，以發揮較高之抗沖蝕能力；反之，需快速達到綠化植生地區可選擇低於B處理之濃度，以加速種子之發芽。目 錄 頁次 中文摘要……………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅰ 英文摘要……………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅱ 圖次…………………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅲ 表次…………………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅳ 壹、前言………………………………………………………………… [...] 1 貳、前人研究…………………………………………………………… [...] 3 一、噴植之相關研究……………………………………………… [...] 3 （一）噴植方法之發展……………………………… [...] ………… 3 （二）噴植材料……………………… [...] . …………………………. 5 二、紅土之相關研究……………………… [...] . ……………………… 6 三、土壤物理性質之相關研究……………. …. ……………… [...] … 8 （一）土壤團粒穩定…………………. …. ……………………. … 8 （二）土壤滲透………………. …. ……. …. ……………………… 10 （三）土壤保水能力…………. ……. …. ………. ………. … [...] . …… 11 四、土壤沖蝕之相關研究………………. …. …. ……………… [...] 11 參、試驗材料、項目與方法………………………………………… [...] . 13 一、研究流程…………………………………………………. …… [...] . 13 二、試驗材料……………………………………………………… [...] 14 （一）供試土壤…………………………………………………… 14 （二）土壤團粒化劑………… [...] ………………………. ……… [...] 16 （三）試驗種子材料………… [...] ………………………. ……… [...] 19 三、試驗項目與方法……………………… [...] …………………… [...] … 21 （一） 土壤物理試驗…………………………………………… [...] 21 1. 土壤pH值測定…………………………………………… [...] 21 2. 團粒穩定濕篩分析試驗…………………………………… 22 3. 飽和水力傳導度試驗……………………………………… 23 4. 土壤水分特性測定………………………………………… 25 （二） 種子發芽試驗………… [...] ………………………………… 28 （三） 土壤抗沖蝕性試驗………… [...] ………… [...] ……………… [...] 29 （四） 資料分析與簡易模式建立………………… [...] … [...] ……… [...] 32 肆、結果與討論……………………………………………………… [...] 34 一、土壤物理試驗………………………………………………… [...] 34 （一） 土壤pH值………………………………………………… [...] 34 （二） 土壤團粒穩定性………………………………………… [...] . 35 （三） 飽和水力傳導度………… [...] . ……………………………… 36 （四） 土壤水分特性測定結果…………………………… [...] . … [...] . 39 二、發芽試驗結果…………………………………… [...] …………… [...] 41 （一）供試植物發芽率…………………………………………… 41 （二）供試植物之發芽勢………………………………………… 50 三、土壤抗蝕性試驗………………………………………………… 52 伍、結論與建議……………………………………………………… [...] . 56 一、結論……………………………………………………………… 56 二、建議…………………………………………………………… [...] 58 陸、參考文獻………………………………………………………… [...] . 5...|$|R

Subsequently he was appointed chairman of the Trustees of the Museum and, in that position, played a significant role both in establishing the museum's scientific reputation and in ensuring it was suitably housed and maintained.|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1980 's in South Africa, {{the work of}} J. H. Maree pioneered the {{modelling}} and design of pavements with granular bases especially high quality base layers. Since then very little {{has been done to}} create more realistic and sophisticated models to enable more accurate designs to be carried out. South African models include only rudimentary stress-dependent functions e. g. M r = K 1 θ K 2 model. Although these models take account of stress dependences, they are not considered accurate enough for highly realistic pavement modelling. A motivation for the design and development of a large-scale tri-axial apparatus is to move towards more accurate and reliable functional specifications and design models for road bases and sub-bases in South Africa, where granular materials comprise more than 98 % of total pavement layers. This paper reports on the design and construction of the large-scale <b>apparatus,</b> <b>and</b> on the <b>materials</b> to be tested. The challenges encountered {{and the manner in which}} they have been addressed, are also discussed. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|R
