5|$|In April, the Bosnian Serbs {{were able}} to deploy 200,000 troops, {{hundreds}} of tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and artillery pieces. The Bosnian Croats could field approximately 25,000 soldiers {{and a handful of}} heavy weapons, while the Bosniaks were largely unprepared for combat with nearly 100,000 troops, but small arms for less than half of their number <b>and</b> <b>virtually</b> no heavy weapons.|$|E
5|$|Typically, {{conventional}} hydroelectricity complements {{wind power}} very well. When {{the wind is}} blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops they can, provided they have the generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply <b>and</b> <b>virtually</b> no loss of energy and uses no more water.|$|E

5|$|Upon arrival, the {{children}} were exhausted <b>and</b> <b>virtually</b> naked. Their appearance was skeletal, especially those transported from Stara Gradiška. Many had swollen bellies due to malnourishment, thin pale faces, and teeth falling out. Almost all were suffering from severe diarrhea, and most had multiple diseases. Some children died after the effort of simply getting up.|$|E
5|$|Abovian was {{far ahead}} of his time <b>and</b> <b>virtually</b> none of his works was {{published}} during his lifetime. Only after the establishment of the Armenian SSR was Abovian accorded the recognition and stature he merited. Abovian is {{regarded as one of the}} foremost figures not just in Armenian literature but Armenian history at large. Abovian's influence on Western Armenian literature was not as strong as it was on Eastern Armenian, particularly in its formative years.|$|E
5|$|Employing {{more than}} 73,600 people, {{institutions}} {{at the medical}} center include 13 hospitals and two specialty institutions, two medical schools, four nursing schools, and schools of dentistry, public health, pharmacy, <b>and</b> <b>virtually</b> all health-related careers. It is {{where one of the}} first—and still the largest—air emergency service, Life Flight, was created, and a very successful inter-institutional transplant program was developed.

5|$|If the ylide carbon is {{substituted}} with an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), the reagent {{is referred}} to as a stabilized ylide. These, similarly to sulfoxonium reagents, react much slower and are typically easier to prepare. These are limited in their usefulness as the reaction can become prohibitively sluggish: examples involving amides are widespread, with many fewer involving esters <b>and</b> <b>virtually</b> no examples involving other EWG's. For these, the related Darzens reaction is typically more appropriate.|$|E
5|$|In al-Karak, an-Nasir Ahmad had Tashtamur and Qutlubugha {{executed}} for unclear reasons. The move to execute them appalled the public, with whom an-Nasir Ahmad was steadily losing credibility with. The executions {{were seen as}} a testament of an-Nasir Ahmad's ingratitude {{to the men who}} had supported him <b>and</b> <b>virtually</b> installed him as sultan. Historian Joseph Drory argues that it was because Tashtamur and Qutlubugha compelled him to assume the sultanate and remove him from his self-imposed isolation in al-Karak that made an-Nasir Ahmad resentful toward them.|$|E

5|$|In late 1809, a MrJ. Drakard {{released}} The life of {{that wonderful}} and extraordinary heavy man, the late Danl. Lambert, from his {{birth to the}} moment of his dissolution, with an account of men noted for their corpulency, and other interesting matter, the first full biography of Lambert to be released after his death. Lambert's position as the heaviest person in recorded history was soon overtaken by the American Mills Darden (1799–1857), but Lambert had by now become a cult figure, <b>and</b> <b>virtually</b> every item connected with him was preserved for posterity. His clothes and possessions were sold at auction to collectors, {{and many of them}} are preserved in museums today.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{government}} censorship was commonplace. Magazines {{were routinely}} confiscated under the anti-obscenity Comstock laws; permits for labor rallies were often denied; <b>and</b> <b>virtually</b> all anti-war or anti-government literature was outlawed. Right-wing conservatives wielded {{vast amounts of}} power, and activists that promoted unionization, socialism, or government reform were often denounced as un-American or unpatriotic. In one typical instance in 1923, author Upton Sinclair was arrested for trying to read the First Amendment during an Industrial Workers of the World rally.|$|E
5|$|Kutuzov {{was very}} {{strongly}} {{concerned that the}} French might take the New Smolensk Road around his positions and on to Moscow so placed the more powerful 1stArmy under Barclay on the right, in positions which were already strong <b>and</b> <b>virtually</b> unassailable by the French. The 2ndArmy under Bagration was expected to hold the left. The fall of Shevardino unanchored the Russian left flank but Kutuzov did nothing to change these initial dispositions despite the repeated pleas of his generals to redeploy their forces.|$|E

The city's demographics changed dramatically after the Ottoman government's decision {{to construct the}} Hejaz Railway, which linked Damascus and Medina, and facilitated the annual Hajj pilgrimage and trade. Because of its location along the railway, Amman was transformed from a small village into a major commercial hub in the region.|$|E
5|$|Servo {{controlled}} subwoofers are not {{the same}} as Servodrive subwoofers whose primary mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination in favor of a high-speed belt-driven servomotor. The Servodrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion <b>and</b> <b>virtually</b> eliminates the loss of loudspeaker output that results from an increase in voice coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil (called power compression.) This feature allows high power operation for extended periods of time. Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its Servo Drive Loudspeaker (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Sports and {{recreation}} facilities. Social policy in Norway {{both at the}} national and local level has emphasized the connection between athletics at the mass and elite levels, and athletic centers have typically been built both to accommodate spectators, participants, and training.

5|$|The {{interior}} region bordering Spanish and Portuguese territories in South America {{was largely}} unexplored {{at the end}} of the 17th century. Dispatched by the Spanish Crown, Jesuits explored and founded eleven settlements in 76 years in the remote Chiquitania – then known as Chiquitos – on the frontier of Spanish America. They built churches (templos) in a unique and distinct style that combined elements of native and European architecture. The indigenous inhabitants of the missions were taught European music as a means of conversion. The missions were self-sufficient, with thriving economies, <b>and</b> <b>virtually</b> autonomous from the Spanish crown.|$|E
5|$|The oil {{industry}} would ultimately {{prove to be}} a resource curse to Wichita Falls, and the Texas Oil Boom ended only a few years later. The building was vacated, boarded up, <b>and</b> <b>virtually</b> forgotten in 1929 as the Great Depression struck North Texas and office space became relatively inexpensive to lease or purchase. A fire gutted the building in 1931, rendering it unusable for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no state}} roads <b>and</b> <b>virtually</b> no {{township}} {{roads in the}} watershed of Hammersley Fork. However, there are dirt roads and gravel roads, and several stream crossings in the watershed. The first settlers arrived in the watershed in 1827 and the first roads in the area were constructed several years later. Industrial activities such as logging were common in the watershed in the early 20th century, but there is currently virtually no such activity there. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream throughout its entire length. Most of the creek has a substantial riparian buffer.|$|E
