5|$|HSV {{claims the}} braking {{performance}} of the GTS is better {{than some of the}} world's leading sports cars, including the BMW M5, Mercedes-Benz AMG CLS55 and Lamborghini Gallardo. The GTS can stop from 100km/h (62mph) in just 36 metres, only 30 centimeters shy of <b>a</b> <b>Porsche</b> 997.|$|E
5|$|Both of Mario Andretti's sons, Michael and Jeff, were auto racers. Michael {{followed}} in his father's footsteps {{by winning the}} IndyCar title, with Mario's nephew John Andretti joining the series in 1988. This meant that the Andrettis became the first family to have four relatives compete in the same series. With Mario sharing driving duties with sons Michael and Jeff at the 1991 Rolex 24 at Daytona, driving <b>a</b> <b>Porsche</b> 962, the Andretti clan finished 5th. Mario's grandson Marco completed his first full season in the Indy Racing League (IRL) in 2006, driving for his father Michael's Andretti Green Racing team. Marco {{finished second in the}} 2006 Indianapolis 500 and so became the first third-generation recipient of the race's Rookie of the Year Award.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 and 1989, Mouton {{participated in}} rally raids {{as part of}} Peugeot's service team for Ari Vatanen and Jacky Ickx. At the 1988 Rally of Tunisia, Mouton drove a 205 T16 Grand Raid chase car and transported spare parts for Vatanen and Henri Pescarolo, but also {{classified}} sixth overall. She later {{took part in the}} Dakar Rally as a press driver in 2004 and 2009. In 2000, Mouton finished second in the London–Sydney Marathon driving <b>a</b> <b>Porsche</b> 911, behind former teammate Stig Blomqvist. After 22 years, Mouton and Fabrizia Pons reunited to compete in the 2008 Otago Classic Rally in New Zealand. In 2010, Mouton competed with a 911 in the Rallye du Maroc and finished second to Grégoire De Mévius.|$|E

5|$|Outside the World Rally Championship, Mouton drove <b>a</b> <b>Porsche</b> Carrera RS {{to victory}} in the 1977 RACE Rallye de España and to {{second place in the}} 1977 Tour de France Automobile. She also {{finished}} runner-up to Bernard Darniche in the overall European Rally Championship (ERC). Mouton {{went on to win the}} Tour de France with the 131 Abarth the following year. At the Rallye d'Antibes, she finished third behind the Stratos drivers Darniche and Attilio Bettega. She placed fifth in the ERC standings and fourth in the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Cup for Drivers, the predecessor to the drivers' world championship. In 1979, Mouton finished second in the French Rally Championship, behind Porsche 911 SC driver Bernard Béguin.|$|E
5|$|The climatic vault heist {{required}} {{four weeks}} of preparation with every scene and camera angle determined in advance. The filmmakers hired stunt director Spiro Razatos and stunt coordinator Jack Gill to direct the second-unit action filming. The pair initially began research for the stunt by testing {{the capabilities of the}} prop vaults and the Dodge Chargers driven by Diesel and Walker. Filmed on the streets of Hato Rey, the chaotic scene demanded specific timing that had to be synchronized with the various character interactions also occurring during the scene. Razatos chose to use a series of camera cars including a crane-mounted camera atop <b>a</b> <b>Porsche</b> Cayenne, which allowed him to film from a variety of angles and heights while the vehicles were in motion, and a Subaru Impreza with a steel cage built around it that allowed for tracking shots. The Subaru's driver Allen Padelford would occasionally accidentally collide with the vault, creating a shower of sparks that inadvertently became useful footage. Padelford also developed a top-mount dual-drive system for the Chargers that allowed a stunt driver to control the vehicle from the roof, while the actor focused on their performance inside the car.|$|E
5|$|After a {{score of}} ten starts, two podiums, three other top six {{finishes}} and five retirements, Toivonen left Opel Team Europe for the 1984 season. He {{was linked to the}} lead drive at the Peugeot Talbot Sport, Peugeot's new factory World Rally Championship team, but eventually signed to drive <b>a</b> <b>Porsche</b> 911 SC RS for the Rothmans-sponsored Porsche factory team in the European Rally Championship. The team was run by Prodrive, a new motorsport group set up by David Richards, Toivonen's former boss at Opel. His European season with Porsche {{turned out to be a}} success. He started with two retirements, a third and a second place, but went on to win five rallies in a row and led the championship from Italian Lancia driver Carlo Capone. As Toivonen had a contract with Lancia for the World Rally Championship, and Lancia boss Cesare Fiorio wanted Capone to win the European title, it was suggested that Fiorio might enter Toivonen in WRC events to keep him away from important ERC rounds. However, Toivonen's title campaign ended in a back injury and a resulting enforced rest that was expected to take up to two months. He missed several events and finished second in the championship behind Capone.|$|E

5|$|Fässler {{extended}} his lead to 13 seconds when Jani was delayed by <b>a</b> <b>Porsche</b> LMGTE car at Brooklands corner. Jani {{was able to}} reduce the time deficit to ten seconds before Fässler made a pit stop for new tyres. Jani recorded the fastest lap of the race in response, at one minute and 30.303 seconds. Jani made his pit stop for new tyres with over a minute lead with Fässler retaking the first position. After five minutes Jani's front-right tyre was punctured, necessitating an unscheduled pit stop to change the wheel, and for extra fuel. Fässler made his final scheduled pit stop for fuel to {{reach the end of}} the race and remained in the lead with a seven-second lead over Jani. Bachler suffered a front-right suspension issue on his car. Smoke bellowed {{out of the back of}} Richie Stanaway's Aston Martin heading into Copse corner and he retired from the event. Joël Camathias took over the LMGTE Am lead but slowed with a car problem and returned slowly to the pit lane, allowing the No. 83 AF Corse into first place. Pantanici lost sixth place in LMP2 to Merhi at the loop and Rast moved into third place in category at Copse corner. The final period of pit stops began when Bruni made a stop, followed by Filipe Albuquerque who gained the LMP2 lead from co-driver Senna earlier in the race. Jani and Kobayashi both stopped for fuel which enabled the pair to reach the end of the event.|$|E
5|$|Toivonen {{continued}} with Opel into the 1983 season, now driving the Manta 400, which {{took advantage of}} the new Group B regulations. Although the Manta was a Group B car, it was underpowered against the likes of the Audi Quattro A2 and Lancia 037, which were controlling the world rally scene at the time. Toivonen achieved a win at the Manx International Rally, a round of the British Open Rally Championship and the European Rally Championship, in the Isle of Man, at his first attempt. He also finished first at the Mille Pistes rally in France, but the organisers decided to ban the Group B cars halfway through the event. Toivonen and his co-driver, Ian Grindrod, received only a consolation trophy. In the World Rally Championship, he retired in three rallies, finished sixth at the Monte Carlo Rally and fourth at the Rallye Sanremo. He also drove a Ferrari 308 GTB at the San Marino Rally, where he was co-driven by Juha Piironen for the first time. The pair retired from the event, but Piironen would become his main co-driver for the next two seasons, and later have a long and successful partnership with four-time world champion Juha Kankkunen. In late October, Toivonen again competed on the circuits. This time he entered two sportscar races, driving <b>a</b> <b>Porsche</b> 956 for Richard Lloyd Racing in the World Sportscar Championship. Partnered with Derek Bell and Jonathan Palmer, he finished fourth at Imola and third in the next race at Mugello.|$|E

50|$|Eight total DLC car packs were released, one {{for each}} month since the games release.

One pack was manufacturer specific, the Porsche Car Pack. This pack features the 2016 Porsche 911 GT3 RS and two other 911 variants from various years, <b>a</b> 1960 <b>Porsche</b> 718 and <b>a</b> 2017 <b>Porsche</b> Panamera.
