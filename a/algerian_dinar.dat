40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the relationship between oil price and the nominal US Dollar/Algerian Dinar exchange rate through an empirical analysis using a VAR Model (Vector Autoregressive Model) upon monthly data for the period 2003 - 2013. Results show that a cointegration relationship is not detected between the oil and exchange rate in Algeria. However, the estimation of a VAR model indicates that a 1 % increase in oil price would tend to depreciate <b>Algerian</b> <b>Dinar</b> against US Dollar by nearly 0. 35 %. This negative impact emphasizes how the <b>Algerian</b> <b>dinar</b> is a non-oil currency and explains how the foreign exchange receipts from hydrocarbon exports help swell Algerian public spending that would cater for public budget deficit curtailment...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{estimate}} the equilibrium real exchange rate and derive the degree of misalignment for five MENA currencies: the <b>Algerian</b> <b>Dinar,</b> the Moroccan Dirham, the Egyptian Pound, the Tunisian Dinar and the Turkish lira. Exchange rate policy represents a key tool in macro-economic management and dominates the public policy debate today. How to assess whether exchange rate is undervalued or overvalued with respect to its equilibrium value is clearly at the heart of this debate. An extensive analysis of the degree of misalignment of the five currencies is undertaken on the basis of detailed country specific data. Overall, our results pick up almost perfectly the exchange rate policy episodes in the five countries. ...|$|E
40|$|Drawing on the {{existing}} literature, I estimate a long-run equilibrium real exchange rate path for Algeria. I find that the Balassa-Samuelson effect together with real oil prices explain the long-run evolution of the equilibrium real exchange rate in Algeria. The half-life of the deviation of the real exchange rate from the estimated equilibrium level is about nine months, {{similar to that in}} other commodity-exporting countries. The general conclusions are that: (i) there is a time-varying long-run equilibrium exchange rate in Algeria as in other commodity-exporting countries; and (ii) the real effective exchange rate of the <b>Algerian</b> <b>dinar</b> at end- 2003 was broadly in line with this equilibrium.

40|$|Quality {{variations}} in retail eggs are widely reported. This study aims at assessing {{the quality of}} eggs according to the marketing channel {{in the department of}} Bejaia (Algeria). In spring and summer 2012, 3330 eggs were bought in 30 stores divided into 3 categories: 10 supermarkets (1146 eggs), 10 public markets (1048 eggs), and 10 shops (1136 eggs). Egg weights differed significantly between marketing channels with 58. 9 ± 0. 14, 61. 2 ± 0. 13 and 62. 8 ± 0. 13 g for public markets, shops and supermarkets, respectively (p< 0. 001). Although shell thickness was similar for all marketing channels, the proportion of damaged eggs was higher in public markets (9. 0 %), intermediate in food shops (7. 3 %) and lower in supermarkets (5. 7 %; p< 0. 05). The yolk/albumen ratio was significantly higher for eggs from supermarkets (48. 0 %) compared with the other channels (around 47. 4 %; p< 0. 05). The freshness of the eggs, measured by the Haugh method, was lower in public markets (74. 3 units), intermediate in shops (77. 6 units) and higher in supermarkets (79. 9 units; p< 0. 05). The price of eggs, expressed in <b>Algerian</b> <b>Dinar</b> (AD) per kg, was significantly lower in public markets (124 AD/kg) compared with the two other channels (around 131 AD/kg; p< 0. 05). It is possible to conclude that egg quality in Bass Kabylie differs significantly among marketing channels, with higher quality observed in supermarkets. The lower quality of eggs in public markets is associated with lower price. Eggs from shops present an intermediate quality. A one-year study would allow studying both the potential seasonal effect and compare intrinsic variability across marketing channels. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Stabilized earth blocks are made from earth, associated with binders dosed in small quantities and water. They represent a very inexpensive and ecological material. They have good thermal and acoustic characteristics, a good fire resistance and are biodegradable and reversible. Defects or disadvantages of this material are the low mechanical strength compared to other types of concrete, in addition to susceptibility to water. The traditional societies developed earth {{as one of the most}} important construction materials by taking recognizances of the strength requirements, durability of resulting structures and the environmental concern in processing and using the material, over the years, however, modern earth construction has replaced the traditional methods. Unfortunately, these methods are also accompanied by high-energy consumption and environmental degradation. This paper is an attempt to expose some of the ways to improve the mechanical properties of earth blocks by using different stabilizers. The study was carried out both in the university Ferhat Abbas Setif, and the public work laboratory of the local council of Setif, Results founded show that suitably blended soils give acceptable values of Dry/Humid strength.

30|$|In recent years, {{and under}} {{constraints}} caused by persistent drought, Algeria {{has launched a}} new mobilization strategy for surface water resources from small and medium dams. However, by making {{a review of the}} studies and achievements of twenty small dams in the west of Algeria, some deficiencies appeared. In addition to reservoir siltation assessment, operation spillways have been the major constraint on the reliability of these types of dams. The objective {{of this paper is to}} use the roller compacted concrete (RCC) for small dams’ design for the benefit it offers and its ability to incorporate spillways. The development of this reflection was applied to the Khneg Azir earth dam situated in southwest of Algeria. Its uncontrolled lateral spillway has registered significant damage following the flood of October 2005, amounted, at that time, to more than 100  million <b>Algerian</b> <b>dinars</b> (1  million US Dollars). The present research encompasses a technical and economical comparative analysis concerning multiple criteria dam design types coupled with the conjugation of the spillways. Thus, on the basis of financial estimates calculated for all design types, the variant RCC remains competitive with that of the earth dam’s spillway isolated (Less than 40 % of the cost). To assess the mechanical behavior of the foundations for both types of dams, (earth and RCC dams), numerical modeling has been undertaken, according to the comparative analysis of deformations in the foundations. Analysis of deformations showed that the average foundation deformations was between (0.052 – 0.85) m for earth dam and (0.023 – 0.373) m for RCC dam. These economical and technical considerations open up important prospects for the use of RCC in the design of small dams.|$|R

The total final energy consumption (TFC) in 2007 reached 20 million TOE, for 34. 4 million inhabitants occupying 2 393 367 square km of land, and with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) equal to 9 389. 70 million DA (<b>Algerian</b> <b>Dinars).</b> The consumption per capita in Algeria is 1 058. 0 kilograms of oil equivalent (kgOE) per person, while in Morocco, which has nearly the same number of inhabitants it is 458 (kgOE) and in Tunisia the figure is 843 (kgOE). The total gas emission is equal to 46 million tonnes of CO 2 with an average of 3 TECO 2 /TOE. The GDP is equal to 3 232. 2 million DA. Detailed information on different industrial sectors, different transport means sector, as well as the agriculture sector have been presented and discussed in the paper. The final energy intensity in Algeria has stabilized at around $ 0. 53 TOE/ 1000 between the years 2000 and 2003. It has been improved by 2 % between 2003 and 2007, exceeding 0. 41 TOE / 1000, which indicates an elasticity of about 1. 23. This performance is due to an optimization of the rate of capacity utilization (TUC) of the production system. The energy intensity reflects the degree of dependence of an economy with respect to the energy factor. The higher the energy intensity, the more vulnerable the economy is to the fluctuations in energy cost. Energy intensity is also a relevant indicator according to the obligations taken in the Kyoto Protocol.
